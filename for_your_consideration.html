<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was hot. Too hot to be doing this.</p><p>She knew that. She could tell by the way her lungs screamed at her to stop, how her muscles were on the verge of cramping when she’d only been moving properly for twenty minutes or so.</p><p>But this was where Rio Vidal could be fully herself.</p><p>Where she could push herself in ways she couldn’t when all eyes were on her. Everywhere she went. Everything she did.</p><p>Someone always needed something: a selfie, another take, a charming story for a late night show.</p><p>But out on the trails she could be free. The strain and sweat made her feel more alive than the standing ovations received in her broadway debut or the five star reviews of her latest movie.</p><p>But it was this, the hard-hitting drama about a lost cause grifter searching for meaning in all the wrong places, that meant that her peace was shattered as her music switched from heavy drum and bass to something infinitely less welcome.</p><p>A phone call.</p><p>“Alice. What is it? I’m-…”</p><p>“Where the fuck are you? We have to leave in an hour.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio huffed out a heavy breath as she halted her stride and turned her watch over to check her heart rate, paying little attention to the time.</p><p>“I’ll be back soon.”</p><p>“Rio, this is serious. This is a <em>big</em> deal.”</p><p>“Yes, you’ve said.”</p><p>“Look, I know you don’t give a shit about awards but if we can get one then…”</p><p>“And a roundtable with some arrogant actresses is the way to go. Got it.”</p><p>There was a sigh on the other end of the line and Rio felt guilty for a split second. Alice was good at her job and often Rio gave her a harder time than she needed to. But only because she was her best friend before she was her publicist.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll head back now,” she relented before the guilt could fully settle.</p><p>“Hurry,” was all she heard before Alice put the phone down on her.</p><p>And so Rio turned away from her desired route into the foothills and made to run back down the way. But before she could pick back up the pace a couple of walkers just a few feet away caught her eye and Rio groaned internally when they began to flutter at her.</p><p>“Rio? Rio Vidal? Oh my god!”</p><p>Rio smiled and waved, adjusting her stance from ‘about to run’ to ‘nowhere to run’. Pulling her AirPods from her ears she self-consciously wiped her forehead with the back of her forearm and allowed the two to approach, soon realising that they were harmless and wanted a quick selfie rather than a long talk about their favourite movie of hers, or worse, an ill-advised admission that she was on their “lists”.</p><p>She was on a lot of people’s lists.</p><p>She thanked them kindly for their support and felt guilty for the second time that day as she ran off, leaving her fans in her dust behind her.</p><p>It wasn’t that she hated interacting with fans - actually Alice always told her she was too generous with them - but a day like today was not a day where she felt like being fawned over. She had to be top of her game.</p><p>Hence the run. Hence the escape.</p><p>Alice was right. This was a big deal. And the next few months could mean that the rest of her career would never be the same again.</p><p>If she could just play it right, if she could schmooze and charm, and campaign, then maybe she could get a nomination. Maybe she could even win.</p><p>And this roundtable was the start of it.</p><p><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> did this annually, ahead of any sort of nominations coming out they’d predict the front runners in each category and invite them to a roundtable where the potential nominees and inevitable winners would be preened and polished before being set out like little dolls at a child’s tea party.</p><p>Rio resented the implication. But she knew it was part of the game.</p><p>Her latest movie was Oscar fodder. She’d known that when she’d signed up. In fact, it was <em>why</em> she’d signed up.</p><p><em>All The Wrong Gods</em> had come out to rave reviews for both Rio and the film itself. It was the first time in her career where the industry was actually paying attention to her rather than her performances being a footnote at the end of reviews: “a standout performance from Vidal manages to elevate an otherwise dire script”, “Vidal adds some life to a two-dimensional character”, “when will someone give Vidal the chance to sink her teeth into a role rather than letting her chew on what’s left”.</p><p>It had taken until her thirty second year to get this kind of recognition, for publications to be bothering Alice night and day for an exclusive interview that didn’t involve questions similar to “how was it working with an all male cast?” Or “was it hard being ‘the straight man’ in a room full of comedians?”.</p><p>And as much as she’d like to let her work speak for itself, she knew that wasn’t how Hollywood worked.</p><p>And so she’d soon be in a room, placed at a table with five other Oscar-hopefuls, all playing the same game with various levels of experience and previous success.</p><p>There was Jessica Dyson, a relative newbie to this game and a rare friendly face in the industry who would be there to speak about her WWII piece: <em>Beneath The Weight Of Sky</em>. Her movie had already debuted at Sundance.</p><p>There would be Sylvia Jones, an old British acting legend who already had two Oscars under her belt and plenty of opinions on the way the industry was going (all negative, all, in Rio’s opinion, racist), bringing with her the weepy drama set inexplicably on a barge (Rio had fallen asleep during this one when she’d had a screener sent to her by the production): <em>Downriver Grace</em>.</p><p>Then there would be Isla McCoy, a younger actress who had racked up more Oscar noms than Rio could count but who she’d met a few times and actually liked, or at least looked forward to speaking to at any and all industry events. Isla was bringing her latest virtuoso performance in a story about a blind violinist in the seventies called: <em>Echoes of Her Hands</em>. Another Sundance release.</p><p>Rio had reached out to Isla when she’d seen the movie telling her how extraordinary her performance was. She’d received an emoji back.</p><p>Next up was the woman Rio most looked forward to seeing. The woman with red hair and a genuine smile and who had turned in a deeply affecting performance in what was otherwise a mess of a movie; Wanda Maximoff for <em>The Vanishing Point</em>.</p><p>But finally, the person Rio always dreaded seeing at any event but who she more than often was able to avoid, was Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Agatha was an industry heavyweight.</p><p>Only seven years old than Rio, she’d already secured one Best Actress gong alongside two other nominations and multiple other awards.</p><p>Rio could only guess how stacked her trophy cabinet was.</p><p>Rio already knew that Agatha would win this round again and then she’d be a two-time winner, one of the elite few to obtain such a status.</p><p>Agatha’s latest movie was an intimate portrait of a mother experiencing the loss of a child.</p><p>Rumour had it that this was Agatha’s masterpiece.</p><p>That if she chose to retire now she’d be leaving the world with such a huge gift that the tragedy of her loss to the acting world would almost be forgiven for the magnificence of the gift.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness could hold an audience.</p><p>She could rewire people’s brain chemistry with just a look.</p><p>Her blue eyes contained worlds of emotions Rio could only dream of capturing for a scene or two in every movie she was in.</p><p>But Agatha held them, owned them, ruled them when she worked.</p><p><em>No Heaven Like This</em> was labelled a masterpiece before it had even been properly released. The critics were desperate for it, the audiences were gagging for it, and Rio would be one of the first in line to it.</p><p>Both Rio and Agatha were yet to have their movies debut properly and were waiting on Cannes the next month to have them released to the critics.</p><p>The buzz around them both was already so strong though, so palpable, that they were already the betting man’s favourites to win; hence the invitation to the roundtable, hence the reason Rio’s schedule was full for the next year.</p><p>But as Rio slowed her pace, coming now to the flat of trail, almost reaching her little silver hybrid, she weaved gracefully and expertly through the throngs of people now making their way up the trails in the early morning sun.</p><p>Her mind drifted back to Agatha, the final of the little sextet of actresses all vying for the attentions of the press and the public to get their recognition, and any accolade they could get their greedy hands on.</p><p>But it wasn’t jealousy that led her back to Agatha.</p><p>The sudden phantom feeling of a body against her own. Those blue eyes that held so much, and gave only when she wanted them to, and the feel of warm breath against her lips.</p><p>She’d had plenty of bodies against her own since then, before then.</p><p>But to have Agatha Harkness so close and then to lose her so fast, it was enough to make anyone go crazy.</p><p>She’d met Agatha for the first time eight years ago.</p><p>When Agatha was on the verge of her first nomination and Rio was still a jobbing actress with an improv group in downtown Chicago.</p><p>One of the seniors in the group had somehow arranged for Agatha to stop by one of their shows and Rio had been transfixed by the woman from the moment she’d stepped foot into the little theatre she’d once considered home.</p><p>Anyone who had eyes and ears knew Agatha Harkness.</p><p>And anyone with a brain was a fan.</p><p>Anyone who felt anything for a beautiful woman was in love with her.</p><p>And Rio was no exception to any of these things.</p><p>But Agatha had barely paid her attention all night.</p><p>She’d seen her eyes on her during the show, she was sure of that. She was the talented newcomer of the troupe though so, lots of eyes were on her.</p><p>But in the bar afterwards, she’d barely looked her way, and when she had, she’d always turned just as quickly, as if she’d simply been glancing over and Rio happened to be in the way.</p><p>Only, something strange had happened that night. Rio had got drunk. Too drunk. Which wasn’t that strange.</p><p>She’d been spurred on by a good show, a rowdy cast, and an always encouraging Alice.</p><p>And somewhere between spotting Agatha for the first time in the audience and going home with Alice and on the verge of vomiting, she’d found herself pressed against the inner door of a grimy toilet stall.</p><p>Even eight years later she still wasn’t sure what had happened.</p><p>But she was sure that Agatha had had her hands either side of her head, that their bodies had been so very nearly pressed together, that Agatha’s lips had been a breath away from her own.</p><p>And then it was over before it had begun.</p><p>Someone else entering the bathroom had spooked Agatha and Rio had been left high and dry, all alone in the little stall hornier and more confused than she’d ever been in her life.</p><p>She hadn’t told anyone about this.</p><p>She hadn’t even told Alice for fear her best friend would make fun of her for fantasising about the older, straight actress who had shown absolutely zero interest in her all night.</p><p>It had happened. She was sure of it.</p><p>But back on the Los Angeles trail, Rio lost her footing in the throes of her memories and slipped in the copper dust of the Californian sand.</p><p>She yelped and collapsed onto her side, her ankle sparking up a white hot pain that flashed up her calf.</p><p>“Fuck me, fuck me.”</p><p>That’s what she got for thinking of a married mother of one like that.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness sure as hell didn’t remember one random drunken encounter in a bar all those years ago where nothing technically happened with an actress she barely acknowledged the existence of and probably didn’t even remember the name of.</p><p>And Rio was a fool to even think about it.</p><p>Two burly gentlemen came to Rio’s aid and helped her back to her feet, fussing a little more over Rio Vidal the actress than if she’d been any other random woman tripping over her own feet.</p><p>She soon thanked them and hobbled off to her car, gritting her teeth through the pain of it until she managed to sink into the warm embrace of her five year old Toyota that she refused to give up just because it wasn’t a cool enough car for a cool actress.</p><p>Though Alice had very nearly convinced her to get a sporty little red thing only the previous week.</p><p>The short drive home to her little house in the hills was enough time for her to forget all about her almost-tryst with one of the most famous women in the world.</p><p>And by the time she was back in Alice’s clutches, let alone her bad books, she had lost all sense of what had caused her to fall in the first place.</p><p>“God, for someone so athletic you really are a klutz.”</p><p>“It happens. It’s busy and the trail-…”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p><p>Rio only rolled her eyes, knowing much better than to get into an argument about this when she was already in trouble. Plus, fighting more would only make them much later.</p><p>In fact, they were so late that Alice was performing a soliloquy on the plans for the day as they moved through the Spanish-style villa that Rio had only recently treated herself to.</p><p>“You can’t just follow me into the shower, you know. HR would have a field day.”</p><p>“I am your HR, and your agent, and your manager and PA and-…”</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Rio sang out even as she threw her sweaty sports bra on the floor and shimmied out of her shorts - all sense of shyness long since gone in their friendship; having shared apartments together of varying sizes and in varying states since their late teens.</p><p>“You need to be on your best behaviour.”</p><p>“I always am,” Rio said with a wink, stepping into the waterfall shower as Alice perched on the counter and kept her gaze down on her phone where no doubt she was answering millions of new emails about Rio, her comments on the film, her personal life, her upcoming projects.</p><p>“No. I mean it. It’s important you nail this. Being late won’t help. You have to charm their pants off. Wanda and Jessica and Isla will be fine. They’re friendly. You have to be respectful of her Ladyship and Agatha. Especially Agatha. She’ll win and you want her to name call you first of ‘her fellow nominees’ in her speech.”</p><p>“Great.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence that lasted the length of Rio lathering up her hair with shampoo before Alice spoke again.</p><p>“Jennifer Kale called earlier.”</p><p>Rio had just put her head back under the water to rinse said shampoo away so wasn’t sure she’d heard correctly. She leant out again and made eyes at Alice through the misty glass partition, seeing her best friend watching her curiously.</p><p>“I’m sorry, what?”</p><p>“Jennifer Kale. Agatha’s-…”</p><p>“Yeah. Why did she call?”</p><p>Alice shrugged slightly and dropped her gaze back to her phone, swinging her legs as she started to type again. “Something about checking in on the competition. I think Agatha’s spooked. You’re the second favourite in the running.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and dipped back into the hot shower, taking her time to rinse out the suds before she leant back out again and said: “It’s just on camera chatting though, right? Schmoozing off-camera isn’t-…”</p><p>“It’s necessary. You schmooze with the best of them. Flirt a little and you’ll be fine.”</p><p>“That’s terrible advice,” Rio said with a huff even as she reached for the conditioner.</p><p>“A little flirt never hurt anyone.”</p><p>Rio would have rolled her eyes if she hadn’t just stuck her head back under the water.</p><p>And she knew she’d have to endure Alice’s pitiful attempts at flirting with Jennifer Kale, whom she’d been smitten with since the first Golden Globes they’d ever attended together two years ago.</p><p>And if Rio were honest, she was pretty sure Jennifer was smitten too. But it wasn’t exactly a relationship she wanted to encourage.</p><p>Not when Jennifer’s boss was the subject of Rio’s most frequent fantasies.</p><p>Soon Alice got bored and was happy enough with the progress Rio was making getting herself clean so she disappeared from the bathroom to give her friend and employer some dignity, finally.</p><p>Rio emerged not ten minutes later into the living room with sopping wet hair and an old sweater over yoga pants. It wasn’t exactly the movie star look Alice would have picked for her.</p><p>“You could at least-…”</p><p>“They pay people to make me look good. An hour in hair and makeup and you won’t recognise me. Relax.”</p><p>Alice huffed and Rio smiled as she grabbed her purse from the couch and jingled her car keys, “Let’s go.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes but hurried after her boss and soon they were on their way to the studio lot where the shoot was to take place.</p><p>They slipped through security with ease, not only because the guard was a fan but also because Alice had all the right identification in place to quicken the process.</p><p>Rio often said that if they wanted to give it all up they’d make a great team of bank robbers: Rio could charm her way in and Alice could work out the rest.</p><p>By the time they were on the set and both hurried to a small trailer where outfit options were hanging patiently on rails for Rio, Rio’s nerves had settled into her stomach.</p><p>It wasn’t that she hated publicity. It was that she <em>hated</em> publicity.</p><p>Speaking to a group of people at a party was no problem.</p><p>Performing to a room using the words that someone else had written for her was a walk in the park.</p><p>But being herself, being her best self, and trying to impress in an environment that just wasn’t normal for anyone, that was a whole different ball game.</p><p>And if Rio knew anything, it was ballgames.</p><p>“Hey, hey, space cadet. Snap out of it,” Alice said urgently as they arrived at the makeup trailer they’d been shown to by a nervous PA.</p><p>“Look, go in there. Switch off for an hour. I’ll pick your outfit. I know what looks good on you. And just relax okay. No coffee. Just water.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and looked down at Alice. Good, kind, fierce Alice who had been by her side for years. She had no idea where she’d be without her and told her this often whenever she was drunk.</p><p>But unfortunately for her she was currently as sober as a nun.</p><p>“You’re the boss,” she said with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes before she turned to leave, taking a steady breath before pushing the door open to the trailer.</p><p>Inside it was warm and inviting, with bright lighting around each mirror lining the wall that made Rio regret not wearing even a scrap of makeup - but it would have been washed off shortly anyway.</p><p>It smelled somehow familiar and Rio put it down to the floral scents of all the various lotions and potions that would soon be on her face and in her hair.</p><p>In front of her was an empty chair before the large mirror that reflected back at her the fake movie star that was Rio Vidal: fresh-faced and still a little flushed from her earlier run and the rush she’d been in to get here.</p><p>But she didn’t have time for vanity.</p><p>Within seconds, arms were around her and a soft ‘ooooo’ sound was in her ear.</p><p>She instinctively wrapped her arms around the woman who had so excitedly accosted her and blinked as she pulled back to beam at her.</p><p>“Rio! My darling girl! I wondered when you’d show. Come come, sit sit. Work to do, work to do.”</p><p>Rio recognised this woman but had no earthly idea what her name was and so she became biddable and sat in the chair pointed out to her.</p><p>“It’s so good to see you,” she said in her best impression of a person who knew exactly who she was talking to.</p><p>“Oh darling! How long has it been?”</p><p>“I-…” but a slight movement across from her caught her eye and Rio noticed for the first time a pair of blue eyes watching her closely, a glint of amusement clear in them.</p><p>Rio lost all ability to speak. Let alone make up the date of the last time she had seen the enthusiastic woman behind her.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was sat primly in her seat, her hair piled on the top of her head in the way that looked purposeful where Rio’s currently looked tragic.</p><p>She had clearly been on her phone, which now lay delicately in her lap.</p><p>Her sweater was cashmere, her jeans expensive, the little boat shoes on her feet surely more than Rio’s entire outfit put together… and probably Alice’s too.</p><p>She had no makeup on yet, at least, had nothing that was obvious to the layman.</p><p>But her skin was glowing, that dewy way that sometimes happened to Rio’s skin when the right people put the right treatment on it.</p><p>It was a movie star glow.</p><p>And Rio hated her for it. Hated that she could look so beautiful, hated that she was so untouchable, so stratospherically famous and <em>good</em> and beautiful that it made Rio feel small in her presence.</p><p>“Perhaps a year ago? On <em>Starlight</em>, must have been.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio said slowly, her eyes still on Agatha who was now raising her brows at her as if to ask ‘why are you looking at me’. And that smirk, god, Rio thought, that fucking smirk.</p><p>She tore her eyes away then and turned back to the unnamed woman who seemed to know her so well she was already taking her hair down and finding her parting in her mop of still-damp hair.</p><p>“Must be! How’ve you been?”</p><p>As Rio allowed her head to be turned towards the mirror so Mrs Nameless could do her job, her eyes flickered briefly through the looking glass to see Agatha, still looking at her.</p><p>She felt her body react before her mind could as she still tried to focus in on the details of the woman’s life, what she’d been up to, and why in the goddamn hell she couldn’t remember her name.</p><p>Rio felt hot under Agatha’s gaze, as if she’d been caught doing something she shouldn’t.</p><p>Though Agatha couldn’t know she’d thought about her a hell of a lot over the past eight years.</p><p>Could she?</p><p>Despite her hair currently being fanned out behind her and run through with expert fingers, she tugged a section free and began swirling it around her finger.</p><p>A nervous habit Alice was always telling her to stop doing in interviews.</p><p>This didn’t last long, however, as her unnamed friend stole it back and Rio was left with nothing to siphon her nervous energy into.</p><p>“And you must have met Agatha? Have you worked together?”</p><p>Rio glanced up from where she’d been determinedly staring at her own nose and looked to the woman behind her before briefly glancing towards Agatha.</p><p>“Yes, we’ve met. Just at parties and events.”</p><p>“Never had the privilege of working together though,” Agatha drawled with a sickening smile that Rio took to be dripping in sarcasm and the woman now leaning round her to access whatever bottle of serum she needed made another ‘ooooo’ sound.</p><p>“You should! You’d be fantastic. A twosome like you? You should make it happen. I insist. And hire me too.”</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha again and saw the smirk she’d heard in her voice before now proudly displayed on her face.</p><p>Sickening.</p><p>But the woman behind her was now tutting, her mind back on her job rather than the wonders Agatha and Rio could work on a movie together.</p><p>“I don’t have-…” she sighed heavily and dropped Rio’s hair where she’d held it in her left hand, “Bear with. I need to go to raid my other stash.”</p><p>“Aggie, darling,” she turned to Agatha and Rio noted that the brunette’s smile had softened in time to not be caught out, “Stay where you are and I’ll send the team to finish what I’ve started, okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded but remained silent and turned back to her phone as Rio returned her attention back to herself, attempting to look cool and calm rather than how she felt, which was hot and bothered.</p><p>She heard the door to the little tin can they were in close behind her and a welcome silence descended for all of ten seconds before Agatha spoke.</p><p>“You don’t know her name.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows, watching herself do so in the mirror before she turned to look at Agatha in real life.</p><p>The woman was still intent on her phone, her profile passive and her thumbs still moving.</p><p>“Of course I do.”</p><p>“Great. What is it?”</p><p>Rio blanched, her brain kicking up to start rifling through her internal roledex of industry names and job titles.</p><p>She’d worked with so many people over the years that she’d developed a reasonably good memory for names but for some reason this woman had slipped her mind.</p><p>“Are you asking because <em>you</em> don’t know?”</p><p>Fighting back seemed like the only option when she was coming up blank.</p><p>Agatha paused her typing and turned slowly to Rio, watching her for a second before she spoke again: “A little tip for you: learning people’s names comes at no cost to you and it’ll do wonders for your reputation.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw almost fell to the floor.</p><p>How could Agatha Harkness of all people be telling <em>her</em> how to ingratiate herself with the crew?</p><p>Rio had an exemplary reputation. She was always on time, always friendly, always made sure to bring coffee and pastries for early call times. And the one time she forgot a name <em>would</em> be when in the presence of Agatha Harkness, who had a reputation for being less than friendly to most she considered beneath her.</p><p>“Are you fucking-…?”</p><p>But her question was cut off when the door behind her opened and a flurry of people came into the cramped space.</p><p>Rio clamped her mouth shut just as Agatha grinned across at her and Rio saw the dazzle that people spoke about when they talked of Agatha aiming her shine at them.</p><p>It was nauseating, just how effortless it was for her. And Rio felt her cheeks flush a little from the impact of it, and turned her head away to centre herself again.</p><p>Beside her, Agatha was now accepting cheek kisses from the crew members tasked with taming her mane of brunette hair, and Rio felt like a child allowed at the adults’ table for the first time.</p><p>It wasn’t until her own hairdresser came back that she was able to wrangle herself back.</p><p>She focused hard on the conversation happening to and around her. Of this still nameless woman who was working with her assistants to wrestle Rio Vidal the person into Rio Vidal the movie star.</p><p>Where Rio had max three people at a time working on her, Agatha had at least seven, and occasionally one of the assistants working on Rio would flutter over to help the more senior crew members with Agatha’s face and hair.</p><p>She didn’t mind, really. Rio knew that if she were a member of the crew she’d much rather fuss over Agatha Harkness than Rio Vidal. But it was fascinating to watch all the same.</p><p>With the sheer volume of help that Agatha received to be camera ready, the older woman was done before Rio, and much to Rio’s surprise Agatha slipped from her chair and moved towards her.</p><p>Rio was just about able to lift her gaze up, turning her head just an inch or two to look at Agatha where one of the assistants was behind her working on adding soft curls to her hair.</p><p>Fully made up, Agatha looked no more or less beautiful than she had with no makeup on and more than anything Rio felt how unfair that was.</p><p>But then Agatha had done the unexpected and swooped in, a soft hand landing on Rio’s shoulder and her waterfall of long hair blocking the two of them from the rest of the room.</p><p>Rio’s lungs filled suddenly with the familiar scent she’d noticed earlier.</p><p>It was Agatha.</p><p>She wondered why it smelt so familiar, having never really been this close to the woman, unless a drunken mind could remember precisely the perfume of a woman who’d once almost kissed her.</p><p>Surely not.</p><p>But Agatha was leaning in, was smiling as she turned her head and Rio felt the soft warmth of her cheek just graze her own as she murmured into her ear, “It’s Sarah.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched the second the soft words hit the shell of her ear and she forgot herself as she turned her head slightly, making their cheeks brush again and her mind go blank when Agatha pulled back just enough and looked at her with something in her blue eyes that Rio had no capacity in her brain to recognise.</p><p>Agatha didn’t give her time to adjust to the proximity. As soon as it had started, it was done.</p><p>Agatha was moving on and had left the hot little trailer in search of her outfit for the shoot.</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly, her mind now elsewhere when the people around her spoke to her.</p><p>She wondered if this was how her fans felt about her whenever they ran into her in the street or waited outside theatres or premiers for the chance to get her autograph.</p><p>Surely it was similar.</p><p>Agatha was a beautiful, unknowable movie star. Who wouldn’t be awestruck in her presence? Who wouldn’t be melted down to jelly when near her, when touching her?</p><p>Who wouldn’t now be thinking of the ghost of her breath against her lips?</p><p>The memory that over the years had morphed and changed and transmogrified into sometimes delicious late night fantasies, sometimes idle daydreams, sometimes nightmares of accusations or insults.</p><p>And so Rio shook it off, shook her silly little crush on the Oscar-winning actress off and made herself back into a professional adult who could focus in on a conversation without focusing on the warmth of her cheek that had just been graced with Agatha’s touch.</p><p>By the time Rio’s face was made up and her hair was styled to to look chicly natural, Rio ironically felt much more normal.</p><p>She stood from her seat and hugged the assistant and then the woman she’d spent hours with now, only now knowing her name for the last half of their time together.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness and Rio Vidal! Think about it, darling!”</p><p>Rio laughed and was determined to absolutely <em>not</em> think about it as she squeezed the woman’s arms.</p><p>“Sarah, always a pleasure. Thank you.”</p><p>The woman blinked at her, her joyful expression fading slowly and then morphing into something else.</p><p>The oxygen was sucked from the room.</p><p>And the soft sound of the radio blasting in the corner even seemed to stutter with static.</p><p>“It’s Grace.”</p><p>Rio could have kicked something.</p><p>Someone.</p><p>The whole room had gone silent and everyone had turned to look at them and Rio felt like the smallest person in the world. But she had no option but to persevere.</p><p>“Oh god, I’m sorry. It’s been a long day. Of course. Grace. Having a moment, I think.”</p><p>But Rio wasn’t as good an actress in real life as she was on screen and Grace clearly didn’t believe her.</p><p>So Rio smiled through the shame and stepped out of the now hot and stuffy trailer, intent on getting as far away as possible.</p><p>She stormed across the lot, only barley able to acknowledge the people who acknowledged her.</p><p>Agatha <em>fucking</em> Harkness.</p><p>Once inside her little trailer for the day, with her favourite person again, she flopped immediately down onto the couch beside a stressed out looking Alice.</p><p>“You look great.”</p><p>“Good because I need my mugshot to be good.”</p><p>“Mugshot? What?”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness just made me look like an ass in front of the whole makeup trailer.”</p><p>Alice took a second before she looked around at Rio and placed her phone down, “What happened?”</p><p>“I forgot the stylist’s name and she told me it was-…”</p><p>“Oh, c’mon, Rio. That’s the oldest trick in the book.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio insisted, groaning loudly and closing her eyes as she tried to think back to how Agatha had looked at her before. Was it triumph in her eyes? No. It was something else.</p><p>“I hate her.”</p><p>“You don’t. You admire her. You want to marry her. You-…”</p><p>“Her poor fucking husband,” Rio huffed out, going to rub at her eyes and then remembering she’d just had them done up.</p><p>“He’s apparently an ass,” Alice said, done with her friend’s dramatics as she turned back to her phone.</p><p>But Rio didn’t care about the home life of Agatha Harkness. Not when she had just humiliated herself in front of half the crew.</p><p>“At least you look pretty,” Alice eventually said again, glancing over at a still annoyed Rio.</p><p>“Thanks. Just took a couple hours and like four hands on me at all times and I look passable all of a sudden.”</p><p>“Don’t give me that shit, Rio. God the amount of women you go through you’d think your self-esteem would be-…”</p><p>But Rio had slipped the cushion from under her head and used it to smack solidly into Alice’s chest, “shut up.”</p><p>“Whore,” Alice quipped and then laughed as Rio rolled her eyes and threw herself properly into a seated position, stealing Alice’s phone away.</p><p>“You’re a bigger whore than me. Plus you use my name to get in girl’s pants.”</p><p>“You use <em>your</em> name,” Alice reminded, stealing her phone right back.</p><p>“Actually I use my face.”</p><p>“Whatever,” Alice huffed and motioned to the rack of clothes on the side, “your dress. The red glittery one.”</p><p>“You’re kidding.”</p><p>“I don’t kid about work. Put it on.”</p><p>Rio scowled at her friend who was suspiciously avoiding eye contact and then stood to stride over and survey the dress a little more closely. “Isn’t it a bit-…?”</p><p>“You’re hot. Flash some boob, show some thigh.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and disappeared to put the dress on, taking the time to admire herself in the small bathroom mirror before she stepped back out again and Alice looked expectantly up at her.</p><p>“See? Am I right or am I right?”</p><p>Rio turned, annoyed that Alice looked so smug, and stood in front of the floor length mirror, gaging just how comfortable she felt in a dress like this when all the questions would inevitably be about ‘the actor’s process’, ‘changes to the industry post-Me Too’, and ‘what did you want to be when you grew up?’.</p><p>But she supposed a little boob wouldn’t hurt.</p><p>The dress was a ruby red with long sleeves and a daring slit both over her left thigh and down her chest and Rio moved left and right to see the shimmer it gave off sparkle in the light.</p><p>“That dress alone will get you laid for a month when this goes out.”</p><p>Rio laughed and shot her best friend a look in the mirror, adjusting the opening of her chest a little so just a slither more of skin was exposed.</p><p>She settled back down on the couch beside Alice, waiting until the last minute to put on her impossibly high shoes and they skimmed through the questions they’d received earlier in the week as prompts for what they might be speaking about today.</p><p>It was mostly the same stuff Rio had answered time and time again. Nothing extraordinary.</p><p>So by the time there was a knock at the door and one of the wardrobe assistants came in to check the progress of Rio’s outfit choice, she was comfortable enough to devote her time and attention to the woman, allowing her to adjust the dress, tweak her hair, and prod and poke her about until she was happy.</p><p>She even let her convince her to slide her heels on and had to hide the fact that her left ankle was a little tender from where she’d rolled it earlier.</p><p>But Alice saw. And she moved close to help support Rio subtly as she led her from the trailer and to where the shoot was to take place.</p><p>Rio’s stomach began to churn with the beginnings of nerves and even the whispered affirmations of Alice did nothing to ease them.</p><p>“You’ve got this. I’ll be right off-camera. Just be yourself… but not too much.”</p><p>From behind them came a sudden shout of Alice’s name and the light footsteps of a tall beautiful black woman, now beaming at the two of them, carrying an iced coffee in her hand.</p><p>“Alice! There you are. Where have you been hiding?”</p><p>Alice’s hand fell from Rio’s waist and Rio had to fight the urge to pull her back as she moved to kiss Jennifer Kale’s cheek.</p><p>“Oh, y’know, this one keeps me busy.”</p><p>Jennifer hummed and glanced at Rio, briefly checking her out in her sparkly dress.</p><p>“Vidal. Pleasure.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but notice her reception from Jennifer was significantly icier than Alice’s had been and she knew why.</p><p>Rio was one of the reasons her and Alice couldn’t spend as much time together as they’d like to at functions.</p><p>And, Rio thought a little guiltily, the reason Alice and Jennifer were more often than not on other sides of the country, or the world, sitting it out at boring movie shoots or press junkets with their respective clients.</p><p>Then again, Rio was also the reason Jen had met Alice in the first place.</p><p>If Rio hadn’t hired her best friend, she’d never have been at the swanky events where her and Jen could dress up and flirt for a few hours.</p><p>And that’s exactly what they did.</p><p>Alice and Jennifer had fallen into a strange sort of relationship for the past two years. It lived only at premieres or awards shows.</p><p>And the occasional phone call about some press matter or other.</p><p>But Rio had overheard a few of those calls and knew for a <em>fact</em> that ‘baby’ was not a word she’d be using on someone who was just a colleague.</p><p>And Rio, being loyal to Alice, and at least initially with no other true friends in the industry, had often found herself in Jennifer’s presence since the invitations to swanky events and exclusive premieres had started to open up.</p><p>In fact, she’d spent more time with Jennifer than she had her boss, <em>much</em> more time.</p><p>Agatha she only saw across the room, shining her light on more important people than Rio Vidal.</p><p>And Jennifer was free to schmooze because Agatha didn’t need the hand-holding.</p><p>Jennifer was charming and beautiful and the exact type of woman who would be working for the equally charming and beautiful Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Alice had once stated that Agatha and Jennifer were who they both wanted to be when they grew up. But Rio knew this wasn’t true - mostly because Alice was desperate to get into Jennifer’s pants and Rio wouldn’t mind being in Agatha’s either.</p><p>That had been, until she’d set her up in the makeup trailer.</p><p>
<em>Bitch.</em>
</p><p>“Jennifer,” Rio found herself saying, holding her hand out with a smile, “Come here often?”</p><p>Jennifer pursed her lips but Rio thought she might be trying to hide a smile as she took her hand and shook it gently, “You should probably go in. Agatha’s been there for at least ten minutes. Can’t be Hollywood’s ‘golden child’ and be late now.”</p><p>‘Golden Child’ had been Rio’s designated epithet for months now, since a mawkish article came out about her in the New York Times.</p><p>Alice loved it. “Good for the brand,” she’d say. Rio hated it.</p><p>But unable to fight the clock, she withdrew from the two and turned to make her way into the studio, sucking in a breath when she saw the little set before her.</p><p>It was smaller than she expected. Much more intimate.</p><p>On the sound stage sat a round table with seven chairs, all with glasses of iced water before them.</p><p>On one of the chairs sat the woman she knew to be the English actress, Sylvia. She looked regal and unamused in the warm glow of the studio lights, her gaze off in the middle distance somewhere.</p><p>Probably thinking about what fresh horrors she could spew, Rio thought.</p><p>But just off to the right of her were her friends, a gaggle of three gorgeous women all in varying shades of red.</p><p>Wanda, Jessica, Isla.</p><p>She strode over, making eyes and smiling at the crew members as she passed and trying her best to ignore the strain on her ankle as she did.</p><p>Wanda spotted Rio first and beamed at her, holding her arms out expectantly and laughing as Rio slipped into them for a hug.</p><p>Wanda was the kind of woman who got on with most people and Rio felt lucky that they’d met on a movie a while ago and had been fast friends with ever since. She was always a friendly face to run to at an otherwise boring or uninviting industry party.</p><p>Jessica similarly pulled Rio into a big hug and Isla smiled into her own with Rio too.</p><p>“Ready for this? Should be fun!”</p><p>Rio only hummed in response, her arm still loosely draped around Wanda’s waist as a means to both ground her nerves and take the weight off her ankle.</p><p>But her proper response was lost on her tongue as she looked over and saw Agatha speaking with the journalist who would be leading the interview.</p><p>Agatha was talking, though Rio couldn’t hear what she was saying. But she was making the journalist nervous if the shuffling of her cue cards were anything to go by.</p><p>Whatever they were talking about, whatever was making the journalist nervous, was completely lost on Rio for the sight of Agatha’s outfit.</p><p>Rio’s eyes almost popped out of her head.</p><p>Agatha was wearing an oversized red suit jacket and… and that was it.</p><p>Her long toned legs had a light tan on them that from where Rio was standing looked natural and the jacket ended perilously close to the apex of Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>Surely that must be illegal.</p><p>Her sleeves were rolled up casually to her elbows which made it look natural and as if Agatha had simply pushed them there herself. Her hair was draped over one shoulder and her eyes, her eyes…</p><p>Rio had been caught.</p><p>She looked away quickly, but not quickly enough for Agatha to have missed the way she’d been staring. The way she’d been <em>ogling</em> at her.</p><p>If Rio weren’t currently caked in make up she’d have been worried she were as red as the dress she were wearing.</p><p>But she kept her gaze down, purposefully avoiding looking back up, and choosing instead to zone in on young Isla who, despite her impressive pedigree for such a young actress, was talking of how nervous she was.</p><p>Rio felt Wanda move from her side to go to Isla instead but she hadn’t been expecting it so she stumbled a little and winced when she placed her foot properly down.</p><p>Wanda shot her an ‘are you okay?’ look that she brushed off with a smile and she settled herself back, leaning slightly to the right so she could take the strain off.</p><p>But there wasn’t time now for worrying about her ankle or that she wanted to kiss Agatha or or that she hated Agatha or that Agatha now thought she was a pervert.</p><p>She was being ushered to her seat, offered a tea, and left to do what quick maths were needed to determine who would be sitting next to her.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Opposite her was Wanda, looking serene and unbothered by the fussing attention of something touching up her blusher. Beside her was Isla, looking a little green with nerves and beside her was Sylvia, still as regal as ever. Then came Jessica, grinning and trying to reassure Isla with a wink.</p><p>And an empty seat.</p><p>Rio felt the tell-tale sign of a weight on the back of her chair as somebody slipped past and held it as they sat down, followed swiftly by the familiar perfume of Agatha Harkness as she took her seat beside her.</p><p>Rio didn’t acknowledge her presence. She didn’t even look around at her.</p><p>She simply stared straight ahead, watching as the journalist took her place and they were all of them introduced to her.</p><p>The concept was simple. An hour or so of chat and questions.</p><p>Each one of them would get their chance to shine, to answer questions on acting, and on their latest movie. Then other questions would be a free for all and they were all of them encouraged to jump in whenever they wanted.</p><p>Simple. Easy. Quick.</p><p>And as the lights moved down and the cameras moved in, Rio began to feel settled. Her mind went from busy to blank in seconds in the way it did when she had an audience or a camera to perform to.</p><p>She was being introduced for the camera and she managed to smile easily, as if it had taken her off guard and she were simply happy to be there.</p><p>“Welcome everybody. It’s a pleasure to have you all here. We’ll start off easy. Favourite movies? Just one. Anyone can jump in.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and glanced around with a coy smile, seeing who would bite first, who would set the tone.</p><p>Sylvia: “<em>Ben Hur.</em>. Charlton Heston was, for me, everything.”</p><p>There were polite murmurings and Rio thought it were clear that neither she nor the other actresses had ever seen <em>Ben Hur</em>.</p><p>Wanda jumped in then: “<em>Mary Poppins</em>. It’s the nostalgia for me. I used to watch it all the time with my mom. Julie Andrews can do no wrong in my eyes.”</p><p>“Oh then I raise you <em>The Sound of Music</em>,” Jessica said with a grin. Her best role. The chemistry with Christopher Plummer is to die for.”</p><p>“Isla?”</p><p>“That’s a hard question. I love so many. Maybe <em>The Notebook</em> or something, I don’t know. It’s a good sick-day movie.”</p><p>Rio smiled at all of these answers and was still racking her brain for her own answer when the interviewer turned to Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha? Favourite movie?”</p><p>“<em>A Woman Under The Influence.</em> Powerful. Beautiful. Rowlands at her best.”</p><p>“All quite different answers,” the journalist said with a smile as she turned to Rio.</p><p>“And last but not least, Rio?”</p><p>Rio ran a hand through her hair and knew somewhere off camera Alice would be cursing her out. But she also knew it would fly back down and give her a purposefully dishevelled look even when she sat in all her finery.</p><p>“Honestly? Because of the sheer spectacle of it and how it made me feel as a kid: <em>Jurassic Park</em>. That or <em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em>.”</p><p>“Alright!” The interviewer announced with a grin, “a good eclectic mix there, I think. Questions won’t get that much harder from here on out, I promise.”</p><p>The questions came slow and steady from then on, and people began to relax.</p><p>Occasionally, between questions, someone would call to cut and hair and makeup artists would run on to touch lipstick or eyeliner up and Rio noticed that everyone was particularly keen on fussing over Agatha.</p><p>She did her best not to look at her.</p><p>And when it was Rio’s turn to wax lyrical about her movie, about the film making process, about the joy of creating this character, she’d forgotten this was something she’d even been nervous about.</p><p>“Can you tell me a little about your choice as a queer actress to take on three queer roles in the past year? Was it intentional, did you seek it out? Or was it just something that happened and you jumped at it?”</p><p>“Oh, I mean, I have lived experience of it, right? I know what it is to be closeted like Angel in <em>Tampa</em>, I know what it’s like to kiss a woman you’ve had a crush on for ages or a woman you spot across a bar. So these roles…”</p><p>Beside her, Rio was aware of a slight shift, of movement in her periphery, of a hand that raised and landed on the back of her chair. Agatha had turned more to her.</p><p>“… they allow me to play more because I’m pretending a little less. So I guess I seek them out, but I also think it’s important to focus on more than just the sexuality of a character. I’m a lesbian and I have been in love and heart broken but so have straight women. And heartache feels the same, regardless of who you are or who you love.”</p><p>The journalist nodded and Wanda across from her smiled and said: “Well said.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and dared to glance to the side, clocking suddenly what she’d expected to see: that Agatha was still holding the back of her chair, her body angled her way.</p><p>Rio took a sip of water.</p><p>“Do you think only queer actors should play queer roles?”</p><p>A question that Rio had been plagued with for years now.</p><p>One that she never enjoyed answering because you could never please everyone.</p><p>“I don’t think queer actors <em>have to</em> always play queer roles but I do think that if we continue to cast and favour straight actors then it says a lot about who and what we value as an industry, and as a culture. But generally having more queer parts available I think is a win for everyone, particularly those actors who often don’t get the opportunities that straight actors might.”</p><p>Two questions about queer identity. Rio knew Alice would be furious.</p><p>She hated it when in mainstream interviews like this it was all anyone wanted to bring up.</p><p>But Rio didn’t mind.</p><p>It sometimes meant she was stopped in the street by a kid, or even an adult, struggling with their own sexuality and they’d seen her talking about it in a medium like this and it made them feel better.</p><p>So she always tried her hardest with those questions.</p><p>For the people who needed her to.</p><p>“And with this role in particular, in <em>All The Wrong Gods</em>, focusing a lot on seeking absolution for what your character considers to be her inherited badness, how did you work through that as an actress?”</p><p>“I’m Catholic. I carry guilt with me wherever I go. It wasn’t so hard.”</p><p>And then she heard it, a miraculous, tiny, snort from beside her, hidden amongst the laughter around the rest of the table.</p><p>Rio turned her head, and saw Agatha watching her, an amused smile on her face that Rio, if she didn’t know any better, would have guessed were genuine.</p><p>But she’d been wrong before.</p><p>She smiled back at her and turned back again only when the journalist probed some more, “So you think it’s easier to act when you feel close to your character in some way?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and laughed because god if she were anything like her character in this movie then she were in big trouble.</p><p>“Close can mean lots of things. If I can identify something in them that is familiar to me either through myself or people I know then, maybe.”</p><p>“I find it easier when I <em>don’t</em> know what I’m doing or who the character is,” Wanda interjected, shooting Rio a smile, “it feels scarier for sure but trying to make it up as you go along for me is the best way I’ve found to do it.”</p><p>Rio settled back in her seat slightly, glad the spotlight was off her for a few seconds, still more than aware that Agatha’s hand was still resting on her chair.</p><p>The conversation moved on and Rio jumped in where she could, but remained cognisant of Alice’s instruction to be herself, but not too much.</p><p>Agatha’s hand had moved away from her chair after maybe ten minutes, and in moving it away Rio felt herself able to breathe properly again, no longer half focused on the pale hand so close.</p><p>And when it came to Agatha’s turn to speak, Rio took advantage of the opportunity to look at her, to properly look, with no fear that she could be accused of being a pervert this time.</p><p>So long as she focused on her face.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” the interviewer had said, and Rio had watched as Agatha pursed her lips and straightened her back slightly. “Three time nominee, one time winner of the Academy Award for Best Actress.”</p><p>Jess whooped and Agatha released a laugh, that was as well-timed as it was self-deprecating.</p><p>It was like watching a master at work.</p><p>“You’re bringing us <em>No Heaven Like This</em>, and in it you play Agnes, a woman who has recently lost her son. Obviously, you have a child of your own, how easy or difficult was it to separate yourself from Agnes?”</p><p>“Impossible. Impossible.”</p><p>Agatha took in a deep breath and Rio watched as her hands fidgeted before her on the table.</p><p>“When you’re playing with grief, when you’re trying to live in it for the sake of the performance, of your character… it’s impossible to remove yourself from it.”</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha’s gaze fell to her hands and she noticed she was toying with her wedding ring, a plain band of gold.</p><p>“I’m a mother before I’m an actress. Everything I do, or have done in my life, is for him. So playing a character where she was just the same, where she was having to live this half-life because her son was taken from her because sometimes boys just die… I thought of my son every day and how lucky I am to have him.”</p><p>Beside her, Jess reached a hand to touch Agatha’s arm and Agatha shot her a quick smile before focusing back on the interviewer.</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and watched as Agatha forced her hands to relax, splaying them along the tabletop.</p><p>She wanted to reach for one.</p><p>“Did you speak to anybody going through that type of grief in preparation?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha shifted again and Rio watched her shrug her shoulders, lifting a hand to tuck her hair back behind her ear.</p><p>“It wasn’t my place to use anyone else’s grief.”</p><p>There was a pause where everyone processed and Agatha spoke again, “Really brought the mood down, sorry.”</p><p>Rio smiled at this and caught Agatha’s gaze as she turned to look at her, and in it she noticed a softness she hadn’t seen before.</p><p>Maybe it was the lights, maybe it was Agatha talking about her son, but it was there, and it made Rio want to reach for her, but she didn’t.</p><p>Agatha’s brow arched up a little as if reading Rio’s thoughts but as soon as it happened it was gone, and Rio turned away to focus back in on the questions now sent out across the table.</p><p>The rest of the conversation went easily, with Rio able to make the whole table laugh a handful more times. And by the time it was over, Rio felt more relaxed than she had all day.</p><p>“Nicely done,” a voice beside her, closer than it had been before, said.</p><p>She glanced around just as Alice made it to her side and pressed her lips to her cheek, echoing Agatha’s words unknowingly into her ear as Rio’s gaze met Agatha’s and she watched her stand and walk from the table to find Jennifer.</p><p>Rio swallowed as her gaze dropped briefly to the backs of toned thighs and then turned to Alice to meet her in a hug as she rose to her feet.</p><p>“Okay,” Alice was saying as she pulled away, back in work mode. “Just the photoshoot, then home.”</p><p>Rio groaned internally but was soon hurried along to a waiting makeup artist who was ready to touch up her face and she was chastised for fidgeting a little as she watched Alice disappear off to flirt with Jennifer.</p><p>From her position by the table still, Rio watched as everyone else was poked and prodded by their own members of the crew and she wondered if it was only her who felt like a dress-up doll.</p><p>But her gaze was soon moving inevitably over to Agatha who was on her phone again, oblivious to the three people around her fluffing her hair and touching the makeup up on the tip of her nose.</p><p>She wondered how she felt, if she minded, if she luxuriated in it.</p><p>But her idle daydreams were interrupted when Agatha looked up, as if years of being stared at by strangers in public meant that she could pinpoint exactly who was looking at her.</p><p>They locked eyes.</p><p>And Rio saw, or thought she saw, Agatha’s gaze drop from her eyes, moving significantly further south, then further south still.</p><p>And then, was she looking at her ankle?</p><p>“Rio,” a voice made her startle and she turned around quickly to see a man in a headset smiling expectantly at her, “Your turn. We’re doing individual shots then the group.”</p><p>Rio only nodded and turned to follow him, knowing that in just seconds she wouldn’t be alone, and sure enough Alice was suddenly at her side, clutching her hand and swinging it lightly between them.</p><p>“I might be in there, you know.”</p><p>“In where? Jennifer’s-…?”</p><p>“<em>Don’t.</em>”</p><p>Rio laughed and dropped Alice’s hand when she was ushered into the centre of the small space designated for the photographer.</p><p>A younger PA ran over to Rio as she was positioned and posed by the friendly photographer and Rio noticed a crowd form close by, the red outfits of her fellow actresses standing out against the typical black and white uniforms of the crew members designed to blend in.</p><p>“We’ll be filming too. Don’t be shy about moving.”</p><p>“Music, Miss Vidal? Anything you want?”</p><p>“Something heavy. Loud.”</p><p>The small PA nodded and scurried off as Rio accepted the last minute adjustments to her lipstick and Alice appeared again in her eyeline, “Big smiles. Wide eyes.”</p><p>“You want me to look insane?”</p><p>“I want you to look beautiful but approachable.”</p><p>“I think if you try for approachable you often end up manic.”</p><p>“Fine. Do whatever you want.”</p><p>Rio grinned and forced a grin out of her best friend too, but quickly softened her smile when she realised she was making the poor makeup artist’s life a bit harder.</p><p>“I’ll smile and think of being on the couch later, okay?”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Rio scoffed lightly as Alice spun on her heel and Rio watched her head back to Jennifer who was now just behind one of the large lights, stood directly by Agatha.</p><p>Rio chose to ignore the fact that Agatha Harkness of all people had come to watch the show and instead she concentrated on the photographer, where she wanted her, what poses and angles she’d like, and she did as she was told, shifting positions and trying to make her movements as fluid as possible.</p><p>It was over before Rio had even thought it had really begun and she was ushered off the set to be replaced by Isla who still looked nervous.</p><p>Wanda grabbed Rio just as she was making a beeline for Alice.</p><p>“Hey, I’m starved. Want to grab something from crafty with me?”</p><p>Rio was a little taken aback by this request but nodded all the same and shot Alice a look before she followed Wanda to the little table to the side full of food.</p><p>“Forget how to walk in heels? What’s going on with your foot?”</p><p>So that’s why Wanda wanted her alone.</p><p>Rio grimaced.</p><p>“God, is it that obvious?”</p><p>Rio glanced down at her ankle and couldn’t see that it looked any different to her other but she could feel the strain, and it was getting worse the more she stood.</p><p>“Well you fell earlier when I moved away and I overheard,” she reached for a cannoli the size of her hand, “Harkness was asking Alice about it.”</p><p>Rio paused, her one hand now hovering over the danishes. “Agatha was asking? Asking Alice? My Alice?”</p><p>“Mm,” Wanda shrugged, completely unaware of Rio’s internal struggle now she was tucking into her pistachio cannoli. “Yeah. Asked if you’d fallen.”</p><p>Rio blinked stupidly, looking down at the plate of food just beneath her fingertips and then forgetting it completely as she turned to look back over at where Alice stood with Jen and Agatha, now too far away for them to be able to hear any conversation.</p><p>“That’s…” Rio mumbled, almost to herself, but Wanda was leaning behind her and grabbing more food for herself.</p><p>“Aren’t you eating? Don’t let me eat it all alone.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and forced herself to focus in on the plethora of food available to her but now she wasn’t so hungry.</p><p>“Yeah. Sorry. I haven’t eaten all day.”</p><p>Had she been stumbling about the place and she’d not noticed? Had she grimaced every time she took a step?</p><p>But Wanda was holding up a piece of cheese to her mouth and she had no choice but to take it, grateful that she’d been forced to but still feeling less than hungry.</p><p>A soft clearing of a throat nearby made Rio turn with Wanda’s hand still hovering in the air by her lips, now holding a half-bitten piece of cheese and Rio began to choke on the piece she’d bitten off.</p><p>Agatha had clearly watched the interaction, and Rio was mortified to have been caught being fed by another actress, even if the other actress in question was just Wanda.</p><p>Surely it had looked innocent enough. Surely it hadn’t looked like Rio were flirting or being less than professional on a set.</p><p>But Wanda’s hand came down hard on her upper back and Rio spluttered a little more as she caught her breath again and swallowed down the piece of cheddar that had betrayed her so.</p><p>“Dodgy ankle <em>and</em> choking in one day? Bad things come in threes,” Wanda warned with a soft smile as she rubbed Rio’s back gently.</p><p>“Great. Thanks. Great.”</p><p>Releasing a laugh, Wanda returned her attention to her cannoli, green eyes darting to Agatha who was now the other side of Rio and picking up an apple.</p><p>Rio grabbed a bottle of water from the back of the table and cleared her throat roughly, “I should go back to Alice.”</p><p>“Careful on the ankle there, doll. Need some help?”</p><p>Rio froze momentarily, and even Wanda beside her looked a little surprised, but she managed to keep her cool and didn’t turn to the woman who’d offered her help, barely even acknowledging it as she shook her head once, shot Wanda a small smile, and then as gracefully as she could she strode back over to Alice.</p><p>Rio could feel eyes on her as she walked away and she assumed it was both Agatha <em>and</em> Wanda, but she couldn’t be sure.</p><p>Either way, she was embarrassed enough that she didn’t want to see either of them again.</p><p>But Alice was busy flirting with Jen and so Rio had to make do with hanging by the crew, and soon enough settling in the back with a worried Isla and an easy breezy Jess to discuss how everything had gone.</p><p>By the time they were all called to the group shots, Rio had managed to speak to Alice about requesting she would be able to sit and so she sat first as everyone moved around her, being practically manhandled into position.</p><p>Soon enough, Rio had a nervous photographer’s assistant adjust the hem of her dress just so on her thighs she became aware of a presence beside her that was beginning to feel oddly familiar but no more welcome.</p><p>Agatha had been positioned by her left side, standing so Rio’s head were at her chest level and Rio felt suddenly like a sweaty teenager beside the head cheerleader in some random flush of fortune in French class.</p><p>Before she knew what was happening, her arm had been taken and draped around Agatha’s waist, and Rio felt dizzy when Agatha moved, without anyone instructing her to, closer to her.</p><p>She felt her hand rest gently on her upper back and Rio flexed her fingers subconsciously in the dip between Agatha’s waist and her hip.</p><p>It was too intimate, too close to be to anyone who up until that day Rio hadn’t exchanged more than five words with in eight years.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t protested and no one had made a fuss, so Rio remained still, though her body burned her from the inside out.</p><p>“You should ice it,” Agatha said quietly after one or two photos were snapped and then people ran in to adjust the actresses all grouped together.</p><p>“It’ll swell.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything for a second but, given there were now at least five people with hair and makeup brushes around them, she slowly turned to look up at Agatha, shifting back a little and causing Agatha’s hand to move against her upper back.</p><p>“How did you-…?”</p><p>“You’re not that good an actress.”</p><p>Rio frowned slightly, watching as Agatha Harkness turned slowly to look down at her, her expression was impassive, almost bored, until Rio caught her jaw flexing slightly and she turned away again.</p><p>“Observant,” Rio muttered quietly, but Agatha obviously heard it because she shifted on the spot and Rio turned back around to watch the camera being setup again.</p><p>Someone came by her and moved her hand on Agatha’s waist, making her fingers curl more around it so they’d be visible in the shot.</p><p>She felt the warmth of Agatha’s body against her own and the scent of her perfume and was reminded of what had happened earlier.</p><p>“You set me up.”</p><p>“Pardon me?”</p><p>“In hair and makeup. You set me up with Grace’s name.”</p><p>There was silence for a few seconds and Rio tilted her head a little as someone came to dab some glitter across her exposed sternum.</p><p>Agatha had clearly been waiting until they were more alone again.</p><p>“A harmless prank.”</p><p>Rio scoffed but didn’t say anything else, though she’d made up her mind that Agatha was just a bitch.</p><p>A ridiculously hot one.</p><p>“Smile everyone! Have fun with it!”</p><p>She schooled her face and focused in, moving her face only slightly with each shot taken to make sure they got all the optimal angles.</p><p>“She calls me ‘Aggie’,” Rio heard from above her, and she turned to look back at Agatha with a frown.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Grace. I’ve worked with her a few times and every time she calls me ‘Aggie’. I hate it. So… I saw the opportunity and I took it. Hollywood’s ‘golden child’ forgetting her name in front of everyone. She won’t forget that soon.”</p><p>It was as cruel as it was genius.</p><p>But Rio still wasn’t thrilled to have been a pawn in this game.</p><p>“Can’t you just ask her to not call you ‘Aggie’?”</p><p>“I have. Hasn’t sunk in. Might do now, though. People don’t like to be called by the wrong name.”</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Agatha turned as the flashes were still going off and dazzled down at Rio.</p><p>It was as mesmerising as it was earth-shattering.</p><p>And Rio forgot how to breathe.</p><p>She turned away and felt the flush across her whole body.</p><p>She <em>hated</em> Agatha Harkness.</p><p>But another break. Another pause for Jess to have her dress adjusted and Sylvia to remove a necklace that was apparently bothering her.</p><p>Rio turned to see Wanda and Isla chatting and she smiled at the sight of the younger actress clearly more relaxed.</p><p>Maybe it was that she had her fellow actresses so close that they felt like a group, maybe it was that the photographer had been shouting compliments at them all as she shot them, maybe it was that Wanda had a gentle voice and a softer smile, either way, Rio was pleased.</p><p>“She’s pretty,” a voice said somewhere above her and Rio stiffened again, once more made aware of who she was holding.</p><p>She turned from Wanda and Isla and looked around at Agatha, arching a brow slightly at the implication, “You think?”</p><p>“You know she is.”</p><p>Rio released a laugh and had to pull back, unable to think straight when this close to acting royalty, when this close to Agatha.</p><p>“I do,” she said as if it were obvious, because why was Agatha telling her this.</p><p>Her hand was now somewhere in the region of the middle of Agatha’s lower back, but hovering so her fingers were just lightly grazing the fabric instead of pressing close.</p><p>Agatha only nodded, her blue eyes somehow steelier than before, looking from Rio’s confused and slightly bewildered face to Wanda and back again.</p><p>But Rio’s hand was once again taken and she had no time to process this reaction.</p><p>Her hand was placed back around Agatha and she had to shift in to get close again, feeling Agatha’s fingers flex at the top of her upper back.</p><p>A strange feeling had settled in Rio’s stomach as she dutifully smiled for the camera.</p><p>It felt like she’d been caught doing something wrong when in actual fact she’d done nothing wrong at all.</p><p>But soon they were being descended upon again and Rio was asked to slide down to the lower step of the small set of blocks laid out for them.</p><p>She adjusted herself before anyone else could so she was at least decent for a room of people with all eyes on her and the other actresses.</p><p>As she shifted her hips to tug her dress down a little more over her thighs she felt her arm being lifted and placed down on something warm and solid and she looked around to see a shaking assistant adjusting her arm over Agatha Harkness’s lap.</p><p>It looked like a surrealist painting.</p><p>In that Agatha was art and touching her didn’t feel real.</p><p>Rio’s arms were covered in the sparkly red material of her dress and her arm was being moved centimetre by centimetre up and down Agatha’s thigh as if each movement would make or break the photo.</p><p>The assistant looked distressed and uncomfortable and Rio leant up to place her free hand on her wrist to reassure her, “This is fine. We’ll make it work, thank you.”</p><p>Rio received a grateful smile in return for her kindness and the assistant moved over to the next person to begin moving them around.</p><p>Clearly she’d been just as flustered by touching Agatha as Rio felt.</p><p>Rio watched for a second before she turned her head up to look at Agatha with a slightly amused grin, fighting her instincts to look down at the expanse of skin before her for fear she’d faint where she sat.</p><p>“This okay?”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to say something else but decided not to, choosing instead to turn back around and face front, adjusting her arm on Agatha’s lap so it was touching as little of her skin as possible.</p><p>But her hand was taken suddenly and Rio assumed it was by the assistant again.</p><p>She turned and saw that it was instead Agatha who had taken it, who had slipped her fingers between Rio’s and placed her hand on Agatha’s knee.</p><p>“This okay?” Agatha parroted back to her and Rio thought she’d heard a hesitance in her tone, but she was so distracted by the sight of her hand in Agatha’s that she couldn’t be sure.</p><p>“Fine,” she managed to utter, turning quickly before she could lose her   mind entirely and pull her hand away.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s other hand sit on her shoulder and Rio wondered what in the fresh hell had happened that this was how she’d end her day, hand in hand with Agatha Harkness for all the world to see.</p><p>Because this wasn’t just happening now.</p><p>This would happen over and over again for months to come.</p><p>When new people picked up <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> magazine.</p><p>Or people watched the video.</p><p>Or Rio thought about how Agatha’s hand felt above her own.</p><p>Because Agatha’s hand was warm and and soft where it curled around Rio, her palm pressed down against the back of Rio’s hand, her fingers  slipped between Rio’s, filling the spaces Rio had never until now considered to be lacking something.</p><p>Just empty gaps waiting for Agatha to fill.</p><p>But then Rio suddenly worried that her hand was too warm and soon enough she’d be sweating over an Oscar-winner.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t pull away, didn’t move a single muscle where she was touching Rio and so Rio didn’t move either.</p><p>She’d lost to Agatha already today, she wouldn’t lose again.</p><p>Only once did her hold on Agatha drop, when the photographer herself came over to adjust Rio’s dress and Rio moved her hold from Agatha’s hand.</p><p>That strange feeling of her hand feeling suddenly less than surfaced and she stretched her fingers out subconsciously, trying to return to her previous equilibrium.</p><p>But when Rio was as perfect as could be, Agatha squeezed her shoulder and Rio glanced around to see her hand waiting just above her knee, expectant that she’d return to their previous hold.</p><p>Rio hesitated for only a second before she lay her palm down on Agatha’s knee and splayed her fingers so Agatha could hold her there again, and this time, with her hand now feeling strangely whole again, Rio felt a jolt somewhere in the pit of her stomach as Agatha’s thumb brushed over her own.</p><p>The shoot didn’t last much longer, which was a mercy as far as Rio was concerned; she wasn’t sure she could take much more of the infuriating woman she’d had a crush on for almost a decade.</p><p>But when it did end, Rio thought she was going mad for the girls around her beginning to move, to switch positions, to relax their posture and adjust themselves, and only Agatha stayed still.</p><p>Her left hand fell from Rio’s shoulder but her right stayed on Rio’s right, and even as Rio shifted to respond to a question from Wanda, and she heard Agatha above her talking to Sylvia, Agatha hadn’t removed her hand.</p><p>Wanda was asking about drinks with everyone after the shoot but Rio felt like she was floating above them somewhere, watching as Agatha Harkness quite literally held her hand.</p><p>But, no. She had to be realistic and not dissolve into a fantasy.</p><p>If she moved it she could steal her hand back. It wasn’t as if Agatha were gripping her. In fact, it was more like resting. She was <em>resting</em> her hand over Rio’s, it was innocent, uncomplicated, thoughtless.</p><p>And so Rio turned more and shifted her hand, twisting it slightly from under Agatha’s grip and for just a second Agatha responded, she’d held on, and then released.</p><p>Rio had her hand back, and regretted immediately having pulled away in the first place.</p><p>Just as she was agreeing to Wanda’s suggestion of drinks, she glanced round at Agatha and saw that the actress once again looked impassive, looked neutral, and wasn’t looking at her.</p><p>And so Rio shook it off. She shook it off like the memory of Agatha one hazy night in a grim Chicago bar.</p><p>She turned back to Wanda and smiled, this time without having to pretend, “Let’s do it.”</p>

<p>Preparations for Cannes were in full swing and Rio had never felt less prepared in her life.</p><p>Thank god for Alice.</p><p>Thank god for her loyal, guard dog of a best friend.</p><p>They’d somehow hit the big time where everyone wanted Rio, everyone wanted to dress Rio, to bedeck her in jewels, to paint her face in the best makeup, to style her hair with products and using techniques neither of them had ever even heard of.</p><p>And while Rio was prodded and poked and measured and draped in all this finery, Alice was on hand to make sure it wasn’t too much.</p><p>That the Versace gowns weren’t making Rio feel uncomfortable.</p><p>That the brilliant diamonds offered to her weren’t giving her anxiety about how much they cost or the various ways Rio could lose or break them.</p><p>That the people rouging her cheeks were the kind of people you’d want nearby for hours every day, the kind of people who’d touch your makeup up without making a fuss.</p><p>Because, really, Rio’s success was Alice’s success.</p><p>She wouldn’t be here without her.</p><p>It had been Alice who’d jumped in one night after one of their improv shows where a seedy looking guy had approached Rio offering to manage her.</p><p>It had sparked the idea in Alice’s head that the way to crack this showbiz world was to get serious.</p><p>So she’d pretended to be Rio’s manager until she no longer had to pretend.</p><p>Until Rio picked up the first proper gig she auditioned for and started to earn just enough that she could support the two of them in a one bed studio apartment in a less than desirable area of downtown LA.</p><p>But it was something. And it was home to them both for over a year.</p><p>Then more jobs came, and more money with them, and soon they were in a bigger apartment where they had their own rooms.</p><p>Then Alice was able to move out into her own apartment.</p><p>Then Rio helped her buy it and bought one for herself.</p><p>And so on until they were both lying across the large couch in the middle of Rio’s new house, both scrolling through their phones, one working, the other swiping through a dating app.</p><p>“You better stop that, you know.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“You’re a serious actress now. Serious actresses don’t have sex.”</p><p>Rio laughed: “Well this serious actress does. Or at least is trying to.”</p><p>She turned her phone around and leant up suddenly, grinning at Alice, “She’s cute, right? A surgeon! Mom would be so proud.”</p><p>“Your <em>mom</em> would only be proud if you <em>married</em> a surgeon. Are you looking to marry this woman?”</p><p>Rio shrugged and flopped back down again, scrolling through the pretty brunette surgeon’s Raya profile, “Maybe. Not immediately, obviously. But if we got on and-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said with just a hit of exhaustion in her voice, “maybe after you win your Oscar you can think about settling down.”</p><p>Rio paused her scrolling and looked to the ceiling for a second before she sat back up again, “are you saying that as my best friend or as the woman I pay to manage my career?”</p><p>“Both?”</p><p>“Both?” Rio asked in confusion, frowning down where Alice rested her head back against the arm of the couch. “Didn’t you once say that being single worked in my favour because-…”</p><p>“Because it meant you didn’t have any problems travelling and working away, yeah. But… I think it would help your brand if… y’know you settled a bit. And also… you’re not cut out for being alone.”</p><p>Rio blinked, stupefied by the sudden damning indictment of her career and personality.</p><p>“I can be alone,” she said lamely, frowning a little now where she sat. She reached for Alice’s wrist and forced her to put her phone down.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said with a gentle sigh, mirroring Rio’s position now as she sat up and stretched her legs to the side of Rio’s hips.</p><p>“That first week you moved in here, how many girls did you have over?”</p><p>“I-…” Rio bit down on her lip and watched Alice for a second before she relented, “Seven.”</p><p>“One every night so you wouldn’t be alone.”</p><p>“That’s not-… I was just ovulating or something. I was horny.”</p><p>Alice smiled a little and reached to take Rio’s hand, “Hey, it’s not a <em>bad</em> thing. It’s actually very sweet if you ignore the fact that you’re a bit of a-…”</p><p>“Fuck off,” Rio said quickly, though she’d relaxed just a little and smiled as she squeezed Alice’s hand. “I can be alone.”</p><p>“I know it’s hard to find someone when you’re away all the time but-…”</p><p>“It’s impossible, Alice. You know that. Seems all glamorous at first and then people realise what a drag it is.”</p><p>Alice nodded in understanding and looked down at their hands still entwined together, “I know. But it’ll happen one day. You’ll find some absolute knockout who doesn’t mind you being away for weeks at a time.”</p><p>“Do I want to be with someone who doesn’t mind me being away from them?”</p><p>“I think it would be impossible to find someone who wouldn’t prefer a little distance from you.”</p><p>Back to teasing, Rio thought with a small smile, and she squeezed Alice’s hand with a playful wriggle of it, “Charming, thank you. Hope you’re putting those vibes out to the press: ‘Rio Vidal: good for a while but gets annoying.”</p><p>“It’s actually the subhead of the <em>Vanity Fair</em> piece.”</p><p>Rio hummed in amusement and released Alice’s hand to drop back down again, “After Cannes I won’t have any time for girls anyway. So might as well make the most of the time I <em>do</em> have now.”</p><p>“Fine. Get it out of your system because you cannot be seen to be picking up women in the middle of a film festival.”</p><p>“That’s fine,” Rio said absently, throwing away Alice’s chastisement with a wave of her hand, “I don’t speak french anyway.”</p><p>Alice scoffed and nudged Rio’s hip with her foot and Rio smiled as she continued to swipe through the options available to her in her little app, pushing back the worry that maybe Alice was right, maybe what she did need was someone to come home to at night, someone to be there.</p><p>But Awards Season waits for no woman and that night on the couch with Alice was the last night of freedom until they flew out to Cannes the following week.</p><p>A team had been assembled to sort even Rio’s outfit for the plane ride over and Rio felt more than a little embarrassed that she was being instructed exactly what to wear for a long haul flight.</p><p>Usually she’d wear a comfortable pair of leggings and a sweater.</p><p>This time around she was in a soft cashmere t-shirt and tan slacks that admittedly were very comfortable.</p><p>She’d insisted she didn’t want any makeup though, and Alice had helped her case on this one, preferring not to be sat next to a complaining Rio if she were made to wear makeup all the way to France.</p><p>She looked effortless and chic, which was the whole point of the hours long meeting she’d had with her new stylist on her festival looks.</p><p>She looked like a movie star.</p><p>And she was greeted like one when they finally landed on the concourse at Cannes Mandelieu.</p><p>Alice had warned her there may be more press than she was used to and so it wasn’t a huge surprise when she was practically blinded by the lights of a thousand cameras as she stepped through the airport arrivals and out into the heat of the day.</p><p>Alice hurried her through, constantly close and as protective as always as she helped Rio get to their waiting car.</p><p>They slipped inside and Rio felt suddenly like she could breathe again as the door slammed shut and they had at least a barrier between them and the dozens of men with cameras trying to capture Rio Vidal’s first entrance to a film festival.</p><p>“Intense,” Rio breathed out, hiding wide eyes behind large sunglasses.</p><p>“You did good,” Alice reassured with a smile, checking their baggage had been placed in the trunk securely before she turned to the driver and told him to go.</p><p>“You too,” Rio said with a smile, squeezing Alice’s thigh briefly in acknowledgement that this was also Alice’s first time at an overseas film festival.</p><p>They grinned at each other and Rio found it easy to relax.</p><p>This was the stuff she hated but could manage.</p><p>This was the stuff that people said she was good at.</p><p>But Rio wasn’t exactly prepared for the circus that was to follow.</p><p>“Holy shit,” she muttered as they pulled up to the Carlton Cannes.</p><p>“Alice,” Rio said urgently, turning to her best friend with hidden wide eyes beneath her sunglasses.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>“I know. It’s okay. They won’t be allowed in. Wait there. I’ll come round and get you and we rush you in.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, feeling a strange mixture of disbelief, horror, and like she were being pranked.</p><p>The paps liked to get her when she was out on a run, a couple times they’d caught her out for dinner with a friend, with Alice, even with her parents, but she’d never had to deal with a hoard of them.</p><p>But the rowdiness of the paparazzi crowd with nothing until Rio Vidal stepped from her carriage of choice and entered into the swarm.</p><p>They were hungry sharks and she was the chum.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>“Rio! Over here, sweetheart!”</p><p>“Bienvenue a Cannes, Rio!”</p><p>Rio kept her head down, angled to where she could just about spot her feet through the sudden flashes and movement, and Alice crowded her to the left whilst a footman from the hotel rushed to her aide at the right, creating space for her to be able to slip through the crowd and reach the peace of the opulent lobby.</p><p>She breathed out and thanked the doorman with a soft word in French and then squeezed her friend’s arm as she walked with her to the reception desk.</p><p>It felt a little like being royalty for the day, or like she’d won a competition.</p><p>Everyone was thrilled to see her, everyone was happy for her to be there in their hotel, in their little town.</p><p>Of course, being a movie star came with its advantages.</p><p>The pretty receptionist smiled at Rio and greeted her in French before slipping into accented English.</p><p>“Bienvenue, Mademoiselle Vidal. I trust you had a good flight?”</p><p>“It was great, thank you. Your hotel is beautiful.”</p><p>“I’d be happy to give you a tour once you’re settled in, Mademoiselle.”</p><p>Alice cleared her throat quietly and whispered, “Basta.” <em>Stop</em>.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t respond because the blonde and blue eyed receptionist was now checking over her details and Rio who wouldn’t have even considered properly flirting with the pretty young woman now just wanted to do it to annoy Alice.</p><p>But her train of thought was interrupted as Alice placed her passport on the side and a loud American voice rang through the lobby.</p><p>“Alice, be still my beating heart.”</p><p>Rio, who had been in the process of fishing out her own passport, turned to see Jennifer Kale, standing a few feet away with her arms open wide and a brilliant smile across her perfect features.</p><p>“Jen,” Alice said a little more demurely, with no less enthusiasm.</p><p>She stepped away from Rio and went over to exchange two kisses with Jennifer, one on each cheek.</p><p><em>French already,</em> Rio thought with a smirk.</p><p>But her attention was back on the receptionist who was now taking the passports to check over details.</p><p>A holiday romance was exactly what Alice deserved and Rio now regretted their choice to share a suite together. Alice had said it would be easier for prepping to be in close proximity and not have to worry about running across the hall all the time.</p><p>Plus, the fact that the Movie Studio were funding this trip meant that Rio could demand practically what she wanted but Alice would be left with the dregs.</p><p>So Rio had demanded a two bedroom suite.</p><p>It was the least she could do.</p><p>And so, once the details were confirmed, and Rio had received more than a handful more smiles from the receptionist, she was directed towards the elevator where a snappily dressed concierge was waiting.</p><p>“Your bags are waiting for you in your suite, Mademoiselle.”</p><p>“Rio, s’il vous plait,” Rio purred with a grin, deciding a little flirt wouldn’t hurt to start the day off right. “Merci, Camille.”</p><p>The receptionist ducked her head a little and Rio knew if she pushed it she could maybe get a number, maybe ask her for that tour later, but she felt a hand on her arm and turned to see Alice smiling at her.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Rio shot the woman behind the counter one last movie star grin before she turned away, pocketing their passports and the room keys as she did.</p><p>“Jen wants to go grab a coffee before the madness starts later. I could really use the caffeine hit. Would you mind?”</p><p>Rio arched a brow and glanced over at Jen who was watching them closely.</p><p>Rio shot her a small smile which was returned but then Jen’s eyes dropped to her watch and Rio looked back to Alice. The woman wasn’t subtle.</p><p>“Sure. No problem. I’ll take a shower and see you later?”</p><p>“Great,” Alice said with a relieved grin, as if she’d ever thought Rio would demand she stay.</p><p>She squeezed Rio’s arm in goodbye and then moved back over to Jen and motioned for them to leave together.</p><p>Rio watched this for a second and felt a slight pang of jealousy that had nothing to do with Jennifer and everything to do with the fact that she was left alone to check out their joined suite in the fanciest hotel in the fanciest of places.</p><p>But she picked herself back up quickly when she approached the concierge and found herself once again greeted like the movie star she was.</p><p>“Bonjour, mademoiselle. I am here to take you to your suite.”</p><p>“Merci,” she said with a smile, turning then as the elevator dinged lightly. Even the bells here sounded angelic.</p><p>She and the concierge stepped aside a little when it was clear the elevator was already occupied and Rio’s stomach did a flip when she saw by whom.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was stepping out in a matching white linen suit and large Chanel sunglasses on top her mane of wild hair.</p><p>But it wasn’t just Agatha.</p><p>The man Rio knew to be her husband was with her. Recognisable from the photos she’d seen of him on magazine covers, from the internet, and from across the room at industry parties.</p><p>He was tall, dark, and handsome, everything you’d expect in the man married to one of the most famous actresses in the world.</p><p>And Rio hated that they looked good together.</p><p>But they did.</p><p>Ralph Bohner inclined his head slightly at her and Rio smiled back, but her attention was once again on Agatha who’d stepped back slightly from her husband who - Rio noted - had stepped from the elevator first.</p><p>
<em>Prick.</em>
</p><p>“Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Was Agatha’s smile genuine? Was she as pleased to see her as she looked?</p><p>Rio had to remain objective, though suddenly she feared the thirteen hour flight had made her look less than brilliant compared to Agatha’s current, glamorous state.</p><p>She cursed herself for refusing to wear makeup.</p><p>But she had one thing in her back pocket that could claw back some power for her, something that now felt like an inside joke, some tiny semblance of a common ground between them.</p><p>And now, feeling a little on the back foot being caught all alone in the presence of Agatha and her asshole of a financier husband, she used it.</p><p>“Aggie Harkness,” she beamed, watching as Agatha’s eyes widened slightly and then narrowed, a slow smirk creeping up her features as she took Rio in.</p><p>They stood like two cowboys in a vintage western, sizing each other up, seeing who would draw first, though Rio had flashed her piece already.</p><p>“Agatha,” the husband was saying, as Rio’s own charge - the concierge - waited patiently for whatever Rio wanted to do.</p><p>Rio glanced at him and saw that he looked less than impressed with whatever his wife was doing talking to another actress when he wanted a croissant on the waterfront.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t even flinched and as Rio glanced back at her she saw she was still being assessed, and her brow quirked a little, amused that she’d won a point so soon in their first interaction since the Roundtable shoot.</p><p>“You’re cute,” Agatha concluded, after what to Rio felt like minutes of a standoff that can’t have been longer than ten seconds. “Call me that again and you’ll regret it.”</p><p>“Threats before midday? Très chic.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes again but Rio caught her lips twitching at the sides and she fought the urge to kiss Agatha there, wondering if she could get away with a French two cheek kiss, accidentally brushing the lips of the most famous woman in Cannes right now.</p><p>“Au revoir, honey,” Agatha purred, giving Rio no chance to act out her fantasy and before she could even blink again, Agatha had turned from her and was sauntering through the lobby with her husband.</p><p>Rio released a soft breath and stepped into the elevator, wondering if she were imagining the lingering soft scent of Agatha’s perfume in it.</p><p>The concierge pressed the button and just as the doors began to close Rio looked up and saw Agatha turning back to her from across the lobby.</p><p>They made eye contact and Rio suddenly wished she’d tried something because maybe, just maybe, Agatha wouldn’t have protested.</p><p>But then the doors closed and Agatha was lost to her.</p><p>The length of the elevator ride to the top floor of the hotel was all the time it took for Rio to rid herself of her silly schoolgirl fantasy. Agatha had no more romantic interest in her than she did in the concierge standing beside her.</p><p>Although, she supposed, he was at least a man, so maybe in the battle for Agatha’s heart he had a total advantage.</p><p>But as the elevator pulled to a gentle stop on her floor, she was led out to a large and beautiful lobby and to the third door on the right.</p><p>The Katara Suite.</p><p>“Welcome to your new home for the week, mademoiselle Vidal.”</p><p>Rio stepped inside as the concierge opened the door for her and tried to school her face into what would be an appropriate reaction for a sophisticated movie stair.</p><p>The suite was more beautiful than even the pictures on line had led her to believe and she wished Alice were here to take it in with her.</p><p>The concierge took her on a tour of the space, showing her the grand shared living area with large curved couches and a view of the water beyond. He took her to both bedrooms and pointed out the bathrooms attached to each and the features therein.</p><p>And lastly, he took her to the balcony and presented the full view of the waterfront, proudly evidencing his hotel’s greatest asset.</p><p>When he’d had assurance enough from Rio that she would be fine and didn’t need anything else, she sent him on his way with a large tip and a bright smile and finally, finally she were alone to run around the suite again, taking in everything she’d missed upon first viewing.</p><p>With Alice gone, she had the luxury of picking the best room and soon found herself situated on the balcony after a long shower with a seltzer and fresh lime courtesy of the free bar just off the main living space.</p><p>Rio Vidal was on top of the world.</p><p>Her gaze drifted across the sea of deepest blue before her and as she watched the sun dazzle the waves with its shine she felt a deep calm washing over her.</p><p>She’d built this. Her and Alice. They’d worked their asses off to get here and now here they were.</p><p>But as Rio’s gaze drifted along the balcony she couldn’t help but notice that it wasn’t the two of them.</p><p>It was just her.</p><p>And she felt a sudden, unexpected melancholy as she looked at the seat beside her, free of another person there to enjoy this with.</p><p>It clutched at her heart in a way she couldn’t shake even as she finished her drink and heard the telltale signs of her best friend arriving into their little piece of paradise high above the streets of Cannes.</p><p>“Holy shit!”</p><p>Rio laughed as she appeared at the door to the balcony, grinning at Alice, shaking off the surprising loneliness for the sake of her best friend, “None of that language, please. We’re <em>sophisticated</em> now.”</p><p>“I mean though,” Alice said with her eyes wide and her mouth open, her sunglasses perched atop her head, “<em>holy</em> shit.”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio agreed as she marched across to take Alice’s hand and drag her to the balcony to show off the view like a proud mother introducing her baby to the world. “You’ve said that.”</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Alice continued to be gobsmacked for at least another ten minutes as Rio trailed behind her on her many rounds of sightseeing around the huge suite.</p><p>And Alice didn’t even complain that Rio had taken the largest room because, <em>holy shit</em>, her room was huge too.</p><p>Once Rio’s patience for her friend’s shock had died down entirely she changed the subject from “how much do you think these cushions cost?” to “how did it go with Jen?”.</p><p>Alice’s expression changed on a dime.</p><p>She went from bemused to shy in the flash of an eye.</p><p>“Good. We just had a coffee and… yeah. Good.”</p><p>“Good? Just good? No make out sessions by the water? No leg touching under the table? No-…”</p><p>“Stop it. We’re taking it slow. I’m not even sure she likes me.”</p><p>“Oh, don’t be ridiculous. Who wouldn’t?”</p><p>Alice shrugged slyly and then buried her face in her hands for just a second before she removed them again and stood assertively, “Okay. We have about ten minutes before everyone arrives. You need to look incredible for the opening party.”</p><p>“Are you saying I <em>don’t</em> already?” Rio asked as she looked down at herself in her ‘Delaware Diva’ t-shirt Alice had bought her one Christmas years ago and the denim shorts she’d owned since she was about seventeen.</p><p>Who said a sophisticated actress couldn’t wear her most comfortable clothes in her most fancy suite?</p><p>“Actually, I want you to change. You can’t get ready in that. It wouldn’t look good on socials.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, “Surely it makes me look down to earth. Normal.”</p><p>“You are not down to earth and normal, you are premiering your movie at Cannes.”</p><p>“I’m not changing, Alice. Three outfits in one day is more than enough.”</p><p>Alice sighed but knew Rio well enough to know not to argue. “Fine. Appeal to the masses. Charm them with your normalcy.”</p><p>Rio laughed and threw a cushion in Alice’s direction. She caught it with ease and looked down at it with a sudden frown as she tested the weight in her hands. “I’m gonna guess about $250.”</p><p>“Wrong,” Rio said with a grin as she stood to go and place her phone on charge in the other room, speaking over her shoulder as she left, “I looked it up earlier. $400.”</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Not ten minutes later, as Alice had predicted, the suite was abuzz with noise and movement.</p><p>SZA was blasting from a speaker someone had brought with them and Rio was being prodded, poked, pulled, and pressed into the glamorous starlet she needed to be.</p><p>Alice was somewhere nearby, out of Rio’s eyeline as she diligently reviewed the plans for the day.</p><p>And Rio, Rio was being plied with champagne though Alice had insisted no more than two glasses before they left, Rio’s new hairdresser, a fun new friend called Miguel, had on more than one occasion topped Rio’s glass up when Alice wasn’t looking.</p><p>Rio’s buzz meant that she was relaxed as she let the artists work their magic on her.</p><p>It was just a red carpet, sure it would be one of the busiest she was yet to walk, one of the most important, perhaps the <em>most</em> important of her career to date, but she could handle it.</p><p>What was a quick walk amongst thousands of screaming members of the press?</p><p>It took close to three hours for each member of the glam squad to be fully satisfied with their transformation of Rio Vidal.</p><p>And in that time they’d turned her from attractive to bombshell.</p><p>Her nails, hair, face, lips, and even body had transformed.</p><p>Alice had wolf-whistled more times than she could count and taken more photos than Rio thought necessary, but she didn’t mind. She lived for this sort of thing. The compliments weren’t unwelcome.</p><p>By the time she was dressed and had the most uncomfortable shoes she’d ever worn slipped onto her feet, she felt ready. Four glasses of champagne more than likely helping with this.</p><p>Rio had been dressed for the first night at Cannes by Louis Vuitton, a last minute switch from her preferred option of Versace.</p><p>But she didn’t mind when the dress looked and felt this good on her.</p><p>It had a longer train that she was used to but moved easily in the heat of the evening.</p><p>It was a deep burgundy, covered in sparkling diamantés that glittered every which way she turned. It had a plunging neckline and an equal plunge at the back, with see-through strips of fabric along the plains of her tanned back up to her shoulders.</p><p>It was a movie star dress.</p><p>She’d arrived.</p><p>“Okay,” Alice said after a few moments taken to get a few more snaps of Rio for her instagram before they ventured into the madness. “Remember, red carpet, stairs, top of stairs, home straight, okay? Then party. We’re scheduled with the rest of the cast so you’ll have friendly faces.”</p><p>“Yep,” Rio said absently, toying with the bangle hanging around her wrist that must have been worth more than three months’ rent of her first apartment. “Easy.”</p><p>“Breezy, beautiful,” Alice concluded with a warm smile as she squeezed Rio’s fiddling hand. “You got this.”</p><p>When they entered the lobby together Rio was suddenly reminded of the power of celebrity.</p><p>Everyone was staring.</p><p>Women smiled and men ogled.</p><p>Even as she passed by the familiar face of an actress she didn’t know well but had seen at events like this before, and certainly on the big screen, she smiled but was rushed past by a work-mode Alice who was determined to not be late for their big Cannes debut.</p><p>The same group of paps that had been outside before had somehow quadrupled in size and it took a little longer to get through them even as two of the hotel staff and one of the execs from came to help.</p><p>Rio’s heart was racing so fast she felt like she’d been thrown from a plane without a parachute as she was cautiously delivered into the waiting car.</p><p>“Holy shit,” Alice uttered for the millionth time that day as she slammed the door behind them and they were left in a tinted goldfish bowl of relative peace.</p><p>“You can say that again.”</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Rio turned to catch Alice’s eye and found herself beaming at her best friend, both thunderstruck by the world they’d managed to find themselves in.</p><p>They remained silent for the rest of the short journey to the entrance to the red carpet, each of them lost to their own disbelief that this was their life now.</p><p>But if Rio had thought outside the hotel was insane, then it was nothing to the red carpet.</p><p>“Focus on faces, remember,” Alice was saying to her in her best therapy speak, “faces, Rio. They’re just people.”</p><p>Rio acknowledged this only with a quick nod before she clambered out of the car, helped by a man in a tux and a headset who had the unenviable job of helping the women out of the cars as they formed a queue to the entrance.</p><p>She placed a smile on her face and only relaxed even slightly when Alice’s hand hit the small of her back and she guided her lightly in the direction of the other waiting cast and crew members.</p><p>It felt better to be with the others now.</p><p>She wasn’t facing the sea of screaming press alone.</p><p>But Rio was the star of the movie and the studio’s best shot at awards so she was ushered to the front, made to walk the carpet first.</p><p>She took it in her stride, pretending to feel as confident and elegant as she looked.</p><p>She could barely see for the flashes of cameras and heard nothing but her name being shouted from every way she turned. But she posed, and she smiled, she winked and she waved.</p><p>She nailed it.</p><p>By the time she hit the bottom of the large staircase at the top of the carpet, her director was there to greet her, taking each of her hands in his and kissing them in a display for the cameras as well as a means to greet Rio without ruining her makeup.</p><p>“Terrified?” He asked with an indulgent smile.</p><p>“Me? Never.”</p><p>He laughed and turned with her to pose some more until he helped her walk up the stairs where they waited for the others to join them.</p><p>One of the youngest cast members was there and ran to Rio before any of the others, and Rio embraced her fully, pleased of the normal reaction in an otherwise abnormal place.</p><p>Once she’d straightened back up she opened her arms to pose in a line with the others, grinning for all of Cannes to see as she surveyed the fruits of her labours.</p><p>Nowhere did she see Alice, but she knew she’d be close, keeping a watchful eye on her.</p><p>But the photo call was soon over and the little troupe was ushered away to escape the circus and head in to the night’s main event.</p><p>Once inside, before Rio could so much as take a glass of champagne that was offered to her, she found herself surrounded by well-wishers in the form of faces familiar and unfamiliar.</p><p>Even now, it sometimes took her by surprise that people knew her name, let alone wanted to speak with her.</p><p>She was just some kid from Delaware who had dreams of making it big.</p><p>But hands were on her back, touching her arm, taking her hand and lips were brushing her cheeks every which way she turned.</p><p>It took ten minutes until a touch she recognised found her again and Rio turned to Alice with a grin, raising her brows, “So?”</p><p>“Perfect. You looked incredible.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly, thinking Alice was being a little hyperbolic but she’d take it for now.</p><p>“Jeunet’s over there,” Alice murmured in a softer tone, stepping a little closer to Rio so she wouldn’t be overheard, “time to schmooze it up with the directors. Come on.”</p><p>Alice took Rio’s hand and Rio obediently followed, slipping easily through the crowds that parted for her and her determined best friend.</p><p>But Alice’s name was suddenly called and it surprised both the aim of the call and Rio, who stopped dead in their tracks and looked around.</p><p>Jen.</p><p>Rio smiled at the sight of Jennifer Kale, leaning back against the large mahogany bar, holding out two glasses of champagne to them both.</p><p>And for the first time that night, Rio wasn’t the one being looked at.</p><p>Jen had eyes only for Alice and Rio knew then that Alice was an idiot to think that Jennifer Kale didn’t have feelings for her.</p><p>No one could mistake that look.</p><p>Alice immediately forgot their mission to schmooze a world-renowned director and turned to pull Rio to Jennifer instead, which made Rio laugh, though Alice missed it through the din of the party.</p><p>“Hi,” she breathed out when they got close enough, self-consciously releasing Rio’s hand as she moved to take one of the glasses offered to her.</p><p>“Looking good, Wu,” Jen said with an appreciative look up and down over Alice’s outfit for the night: a sleek white dress that was simple, understated, and elegant.</p><p>“You look incredible,” Alice offered right back and Rio suddenly felt like a spare part to their little flirt.</p><p>She cleared her throat and glanced over her shoulder to see if she could make a break for it with anyone else she knew.</p><p>“Agatha said she saw you in the lobby earlier, Vidal,” Jen said suddenly and Rio turned to her with raised brows.</p><p>Agatha. In the whirlwind of the past few hours she’d forgotten all about her.</p><p>Her stomach flipped and she ignored it, instead taking the glass of champagne and taking a quick sip. Bubbles helped to calm nerves. It must be scientific or something.</p><p>“She did?”</p><p>Cool enough, disinterested enough. She was an actress for a reason.</p><p>“Mm. You’re on her floor too. She’s just next door.”</p><p>This was news to Rio. News she was very glad she hadn’t been aware of until now.</p><p>“Where is she?” Alice asked curiously, glancing around the throng of people.</p><p>“Oh, she’s been trapped by a couple studio heads. Ralph’s not helping much.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this and was about to fish for more detail on how exactly Mr Agatha Harkness wouldn’t be helping when she felt a touch to her elbow and she turned to see Carol Danvers grinning at her.</p><p>“Hey, you. I have someone I want to introduce you to.”</p><p>Before Rio could even say hi back, she’d leant around her and was addressing Alice with a smile, “Mind if I steal her Alice? You’ll be pleased with me, promise.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes playfully but nodded and Rio knew if Jen weren’t there she’d have insisted on coming with but as it was, she had other priorities.</p><p>Plus, of all Rio’s friends in the industry, Carol was probably the safest bet to be left alone with.</p><p>Straight-laced and well respected, it had taken Rio several bottles of beer and much pleading to get Carol to allow her one cigarette one night on her terrace back in LA. So Alice was more than content to let Rio go play with her for a little while as she flirted some more with Jen.</p><p>Carol only smiled and grabbed Rio’s hand, leading her through the crowds until they arrived at their destination and Rio suddenly wanted to die.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha,” Carol said, reaching to touch the pale skin of a toned arm resting along the side of a black dress.</p><p>Rio could see a sharp little cape visible just beneath the long wavy brunette hair that lay across it down her back. The neckline looked to be high and the fit straight down, with a train a little smaller than Rio’s pooling behind her.</p><p>As Agatha turned, Rio in took a sharp breath, now able to see the look in full.</p><p>The cut was indeed high to her neck, a shallow curve giving just a glimpse of toned traps until the fabric appeared again at her shoulders, creating a little sleeve that connected to the cape Rio had seen from behind.</p><p>The effect was intoxicating.</p><p>The dress hugged Agatha’s body perfectly without showing much of it off at all apart from her arms. And Rio found it hard not to stare at them.</p><p>But Agatha was looking at her now, giving her a once over, once, twice, three times.</p><p>Rio felt hot all of a sudden, embarrassed that it might look like she’d <em>asked</em> Carol to do this.</p><p>“Agatha, have you met my friend Rio Vidal?”</p><p>Rio wanted to die.</p><p>She saw Agatha’s lips twitch in amusement and saw she was about to answer when a man’s voice entered the fray: “Rio,” he said triumphantly, “that’s it. We saw you in the hotel today. I knew you looked familiar.”</p><p>Rio tore her gaze from Agatha’s and looked up to the man now offering his hand to her. She took it and shook firmly.</p><p>“I’m Ralph, Agatha’s husband.”</p><p>“Pleasure,” Rio said, though the pleasure she’d stated didn’t quite meet her gaze as she stared up into the eyes of the man that was lucky enough to be married to the goddess still standing before her.</p><p>“So you have met?” Carol asked with a smile, “Good. That makes this easier then. Agatha, Rio’s a huge fan.”</p><p>
<em>Oh god.</em>
</p><p>“The night you won the Oscar, we’d only just met, Rio hosted this tiny dinner party and we all sat on the floor crowded around the tiny screen watching the show.”</p><p>“You did, did you?”</p><p>Rio caught Agatha’s eye again and watched pools of blue sparkle like the sea she’d been looking out over just a few hours ago.</p><p>But then Ralph had moved to snake an arm around his wife and their eye contact dropped as Rio watched this happen with an unwelcome feeling of jealousy flare up in her chest.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t even reacted to it, she was still watching Rio.</p><p>“Anyway, all that to say, I think you guys would be amazing on screen together. You’ve sway, Agatha, anything you think little Rio here could jump in with you on?”</p><p>Rio’s previous state of jealousy faded so suddenly it was like it hadn’t happened.</p><p>She was so mortified that Agatha might think she’d asked Carol to help her get into a movie with her that she couldn’t breathe with it, though she was aware she’d only said one word since arriving to this little corner of the party.</p><p>“Rio Vidal in a movie with me?” Agatha asked with a growing smirk, her gaze still on Rio though Rio was now doing everything in her power not to meet it.</p><p>“Nothing springs to mind but I can keep an eye out. But asking for a friend and not for yourself, Danvers? Didn’t enjoy working with me before?”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, wondering if Agatha were throwing her a bone by moving the focus of the conversation to Carol rather than herself. But she still didn’t dare look at her again as Carol answered with an ease of manner that suggested she actually had enjoyed working with Agatha and even liked her.</p><p>But Rio’s attention was now on Ralph.</p><p>She watched as he swigged his champagne, his hand still resting on Agatha’s hip, his eyes on the crowd, and at a lower vantage point than would suggest he were looking at people’s faces.</p><p>Rio fought off a shiver, not believing for a second that anyone married to Agatha Harkness would even bother checking out anyone else. Was this guy blind?</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>The sound of her name shook her back down to the conversation and she was surprised to see that it was Agatha addressing her.</p><p>Their eyes met and Rio felt her heart rate pick up again, performing a one track percussion solo against her ribcage.</p><p>“How are you enjoying Cannes?”</p><p>It was such a simple question, as if she and Agatha were just shooting the breeze like any old friends might. But Agatha was one of the most powerful people in the room, at this festival, in Hollywood, and Rio couldn’t take her eyes off her.</p><p>“I mean… I’ve mostly seen my room and the red carpet, but so far so good.”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little and Rio thought she saw her gaze drop a few inches briefly before she took a sip of her champagne.</p><p>She had to get a grip.</p><p>“It’s the only festival I ever come to,” Ralph said suddenly, taking advantage of his position by Agatha to join in the conversation when as far as Rio was concerned he absolutely was not welcome.</p><p>“Best wine, best food, best beaches.”</p><p>Carol smiled warmly at him, the only one of the little group who was apparently willing to indulge this kind of conversation and Rio took the opportunity to excuse herself, squeezing her friend’s arm in farewell before she turned to leave.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said quickly, stepping away from her husband as he began to regale Carol with stories of Cannes passed.</p><p>Rio felt a warm hand curl around her wrist and turned in surprise to Agatha, “Don’t go far. I want to introduce you to Lilia.”</p><p>Rio frowned slightly and turned her body back to Agatha, the two of them now a foot or so away from Carol and Ralph.</p><p>Agatha’s hand remained curled around her wrist.</p><p>“Lilia? Who-…?”</p><p>But it clicked suddenly, Lilia Calderu, two generations above Agatha, an acting legend who still demanded a huge pay check as well as the respect of the whole industry.</p><p>“Really?” Rio finished feebly, a little in shock that Agatha would even offer this.</p><p>“I was talking to her about you last week.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe what she was hearing and if Agatha hadn’t been right in front of her, her soft hand still curled around her wrist, she might have thought she was teasing her.</p><p>But the look in her eyes told her otherwise.</p><p>“I… okay,” Rio said quietly, a light furrow appearing in her brow, wondering why Agatha Harkness was talking to industry heavy weights about her.</p><p>They looked at each other for a second longer and then Agatha slowly released her wrist, her eyes darting down again briefly before they moved back up, “You look good.”</p><p>And Rio opened her mouth to respond, to tell Agatha that she looked better than anyone else in the room, than anyone else on the planet, but her name was called from somewhere behind her and Agatha glanced over, “it’s your director. Best go.”</p><p>She knew she was being dismissed, but she couldn’t feel the sting of it because Agatha Harkness thought she looked good, was still looking at her, was still close.</p><p>Suddenly she was 24 again, alone with Agatha in a toilet stall, with no thoughts in her head except how lucky she was that Agatha were looking at her like that.</p><p>But the memory faded as Agatha turned from her and Rio had no choice but to make her way over to her director, feeling the sickly feeling of someone who couldn’t quite get a hold on their emotions at a time where she had to be anything but emotional.</p><p>She didn’t see Agatha for a while after their first interaction and didn’t even see Alice for a little while either.</p><p>The party was so huge and the space so crowded that it was impossible to find anyone easily.</p><p>Rio stuck with her cast and crew for a little while, feeling the affect of champagne slowly work its way into her system, even if she were making sure to top it off with water and canapés.</p><p>It was when she was speaking to a nervous Spanish director in a quiet corner that she found Alice again. Or, Alice found her.</p><p>She came over with a bright smile and introduced herself to the director, surprising him by speaking Spanish with almost as much fluency as Rio had been.</p><p>Once they’d extricated themselves and Alice had exchanged her card with the director, Rio got a rundown of her performance for the night from Alice.</p><p>“I’ve had four directors, at least a dozen producers, two studio heads, and countless actors all bother me about you. I haven’t spoken to anyone who hasn’t mentioned you. Everyone’s charmed, everyone’s impressed. You’ve got a career yet, kid.”</p><p>Rio laughed at the theatrics as Alice put on her best Cary Grant voice and tugged her over to an area with seats, desperate to get off her feet for the first time in almost three hours.</p><p>“Enough about all that. Where’s Jen? How’s Jen?”</p><p>Alice only grinned in response to this and was about to answer when she spotted someone behind Rio’s shoulder and stood quickly, making Rio jump a little at the urgency of it.</p><p>“Ms Calderu,” she said reverently and a jolt of panic shot through Rio because if Lilia were here then…</p><p>“Lilia,” Agatha’s voice sounded suddenly, “this is Alice, Rio’s manager.”</p><p>Rio stood slowly straightening herself out quickly before she turned to Lilia, watching as Alice rushed around and held her hand out to her, “Pleasure, Ms Calderu.”</p><p>“Please,” the older woman said with a friendly wave of her hand, but shook Alice’s all the same, “Lilia’s fine.”</p><p>“And,” Agatha continued, holding a hand out to Rio as if to show her off, “this is Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio smiled slightly as Lilia took her all in, looking her over slowly and smiling as she did.</p><p>“The talk of the town.”</p><p>“Lilia,” Rio breathed out, stepping around her now abandoned chair to hold her own hand out to Lilia, feeling Agatha’s eyes on her every movement.</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” Lilia said with an enigmatic smile, “I’ve had Harkness here in my ear all night about you.”</p><p>“A little exaggeration there,” Agatha said quickly, moving around to sit down in the seat Rio had just vacated.</p><p>“Not by much,” Lilia countered, still maintaining eye contact with Rio. It felt a lot like Lilia were looking for something in her brown eyes, but Rio couldn’t be sure what it was.</p><p>There was talk, obviously. Hollywood was a town of talkers, gossipers. Lilia had a reputation for being a little kooky and Rio had seen her work, seen her interviews, knew she could be a little intense, but this… this was something else.</p><p>“I see a lot of light in you, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and heard a movement behind her that suggested Agatha had turned in her seat to watch the two of them but she couldn’t take her eyes away from Lilia who simply stared at her.</p><p>“I… Thank you?”</p><p>Lilia just hummed and from the corner of her eye Rio saw Alice step a little closer, her fingers just grazing the side of Rio’s forearm where it rested by her side. But Lilia wasn’t a threat, wasn’t making Rio uncomfortable, more… exposed.</p><p>But nothing felt more exposing than Lilia turning the hand she still held onto over, supporting Rio’s wrist as she traced her fingers over the lines of her palm.</p><p>“God,” Agatha said from somewhere behind them, “Jesus, Lilia. We’re at a party, not a seance.”</p><p>“I’m curious,” Lilia said quietly, though Rio was sure it was so quiet that Agatha wouldn’t have heard it.</p><p>Lilia’s touch was soft and for the first time she’d dropped her gaze from Rio to look down at her palm, tracing the lines slowly. Alice had moved even closer and was leaning over to see if she could see what Lilia was looking at but to both her and Rio it looked like a whole lot of nothing.</p><p>After what felt like a lifetime and a lot of huffing from Agatha behind them, Lilia gently curled Rio’s fingers over and covered her hand with her own.</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>“I… what’s interesting?”</p><p>“Do you see an Oscar in there?” Alice asked in all seriousness and earned a quick slap to her arm from Rio.</p><p>But Lilia was just smiling and moving around to take Alice’s seat, leaving the two original occupiers of the chairs to have to stand up.</p><p>Rio shifted a little where she stood, transferring her weight to one foot to ease help the discomfort.</p><p>“So,” Lilia said suddenly, a little more spritely now she was seated and had apparently read whatever she’d read in Rio’s palm. “I haven’t had one conversation tonight where your name hasn’t come up in some capacity. You’re quite the hit.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and had to fight back her grin, completely flummoxed by this woman she’d been watching since childhood now sitting before her.</p><p>Sure, she’d caught glimpses of her at awards shows and parties before, but she’d never been this close, never deigned to talk to the great Lilia Calderu.</p><p>She felt a different kind of intimidation with her compared to Agatha. Maybe because she hadn’t once had Lilia pressing her into the door of a bathroom stall, maybe because Lilia didn’t make her pulse quicken and her legs feel like jelly.</p><p>“It’s been a whirlwind,” Rio answered in the best media-trained response she could come up with.</p><p>Lilia only smiled and Agatha was the one to respond, “Jen’s furious about it. Thinks you have an industry plant paying people to keep your name being said. Keeps you fresh on people’s minds.”</p><p>“Oh? Does she think I’m raking in twenty mill a picture or something?”</p><p>Agatha smirked up at Rio and moved her arms to rest on the arms of the little chair she’d stolen, turning it into a throne beneath her.</p><p>“No, but I am.”</p><p>God, Rio wanted to kiss that damn smug look right off of her twenty-million-a-picture-face.</p><p>“Alice,” Lilia interjected suddenly, causing Alice to jump where Rio was still staring at Agatha, refusing to look away until she did.</p><p>“My manager is here, Helen. Allow me to introduce you?”</p><p>Rio broke the stare then, surprised by what she was hearing. She didn’t even have a second to regret it though because she was so intent on looking at Alice who looked just as shocked as she felt.</p><p>“Yeah, I mean, yeah. Of course. That would be-… yeah.”</p><p>Lilia smiled and stood slowly from her seat, offering her bent arm to a shell-shocked Alice who sent Rio a small, unbelieving smile before she let Lilia walk her away to find her manager.</p><p>Rio watched them go and then immediately went to sit down, just desperate to get off her feet for a second.</p><p>The second she did she looked up and regretted it immediately because she had Agatha directly in her line of vision and saw her watch her curiously. Rio shifted slightly, self-consciously rearranging her dress so she wasn’t accidentally exposing herself to the room and the woman opposite.</p><p>“That went well,” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“The palm thing,” Rio said slowly, looking to check Lilia wasn’t in earshot, “what was that?”</p><p>“Oh, she likes to check before she works with people.”</p><p>“Check what?”</p><p>“I think it’s mostly to freak people out, test their nerve. You held up well.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, unsure if Agatha were praising her or making fun of her, or maybe both.</p><p>She decided to turn the conversation around, wanting to claw some power back because she had nowhere to look other than at the woman before her and the heady mix of champagne and compliments all night was making her want to jump her.</p><p>So the only topic that could possibly dampen her desire was what she brought to the table: “Ralph seems to be enjoying himself.”</p><p>This tangent seemed to take Agatha by surprise and her eyebrows shot halfway up her forehead as her fingers thrummed the arms of her chair, she surveyed Rio for a second before she suddenly dropped her gaze and Rio registered that this was the first time all evening that Agatha had been the one to properly look away from her first.</p><p>“He enjoys the glitz.”</p><p>“And you don’t?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged and slowly brought her gaze back around to Rio, her blue eyes dropping briefly to dance across her diamanté-covered dress, “I like the sparkle.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, sure that if had been anyone else she might have picked up the thread of the flirt and let it unravel between them but it was Agatha, so she forced herself to ignore it.</p><p>But then she’d been silent for too long.</p><p>So long that Agatha’s gaze had flickered up again to meet her own and Agatha across from her raised her brows.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>She turned away and cleared her throat, wondering why her body was betraying her like this.</p><p>Her fingers curled around the arms of the chair she’d sat in to take the weight off her aching feet that had now become the perfect viewing platform to stare at the one person she absolutely, positively could not have.</p><p>“Sorry,” she uttered after another few beats of silence, her pulse beating so erratically that surely Agatha could see her cheeks flushing beneath the expertly applied makeup.</p><p>“Long night. Lots of champagne.”</p><p>She didn’t look back around at Agatha but knew her eyes were still on her.</p><p>How could she not know?</p><p>“You’re opening the ceremony tomorrow?” Rio asked in an attempt to try and move the conversation back into safer territory.</p><p>“I am. Will you be there?”</p><p>“We couldn’t get tickets.”</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha’s brows shot up and she looked pensive for a second before she asked: “Would you like tickets?”</p><p>Rio blinked, wondering if Agatha were trying to trap her in some way.</p><p>But she decided she wasn’t and so she was honest.</p><p>“To see the most talked about movie in years?”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little, and Rio thought it was the most beautiful she’d ever looked.</p><p>“You flatter me.”</p><p>“Aren’t you used to that?”</p><p>Agatha’s smile widened and Rio felt her own grow to match it. God, this woman was devastating.</p><p>“Not from you.”</p><p>“My apologies, Ms Harkness. Must have left my manners at the roundtable.”</p><p>Agatha released a soft laugh and raised her hand to run through her hair and Rio couldn’t help it when her eyes flashed down to the curve of her bicep and she felt a jolt of desire sit low in her stomach.</p><p>“I’m not sure you were being particularly polite then either.”</p><p>“Oh? Did I offend you somehow? Not fawn enough over you?”</p><p>“Certainly didn’t tell me what a big fan you were.”</p><p>Rio laughed at this and stuck her tongue into the inside of her cheek, watching Agatha’s eyes dart to it before she spoke again, “And yet you’ve never told me you were a fan of my work.”</p><p>“No accounting for taste,” Agatha said with a smirk as their little bubble was burst and they’d been discovered by the who’s who of the Cannes festival again.</p><p>They watched each other even as they were descended upon.</p><p>Rio felt warmed under Agatha’s gaze but it wasn’t the usual flush of an unrequited crush.</p><p>Her whole body felt aflame, her insides crackling with the intensity of Agatha’s eyes on her.</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” the man above her stole her attention and she was helped to her feet by him, smiling gratefully as she stood before him.</p><p>From the corner of her eye she saw Agatha’s attention being taken by an actor that Rio had heard bad things but she didn’t have the chance to look at her more as her attention was stolen by the man before her already asking whether she was enjoying the festival.</p><p>Somewhere in the next few minutes Rio lost Agatha to the crowds that had moved to swallow them both up.</p><p>She didn’t see her for the rest of the night.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Alice had found her again.</p><p>“You’re not going home with Jen?”</p><p>“Shh! God. No discretion,” Alice accused with a huff as she took Rio’s arm, “How drunk are you? We should leave whilst on a high. Leave them wanting more.”</p><p>Rio laughed and realised she was quite drunk because a few people turned around to look at her after she’d barked it out.</p><p>“Maybe that’s a good idea.”</p><p>Alice steered Rio out of the party with a firm hand on her lower back and that same determination to get Rio as quickly and cleanly as possible.</p><p>In the end, it took another thirty minutes to get Rio out and into a waiting car.</p><p>“I hate that you’re famous sometimes,” Alice huffed as she slammed the door shut behind them and Rio only rolled her eyes and laughed.</p><p>“Isn’t that your <em>whole</em> job?”</p><p>“Whatever.”</p><p>Rio laughed again and rolled her head around to stare out the window, wondering if she’d been charming enough to the hoards of people who’d approached her that night.</p><p>By the time they’d arrived back in their suite, Rio was feeling significantly happier about her performance of the evening.</p><p>Alice had been telling her how many business cards she’d received, regaling her of the projects people had been hinting at getting Rio on board with.</p><p>It felt like a soothing bedtime story that her parents may have told her when she was little.</p><p>Only this story didn’t have princesses and dragons it had movies and famous directors.</p><p>Rio may have been gently lulled to sleep by Alice but she was also harshly woken by her not four hours later.</p><p>She groaned and rolled over in the king-sized bed, trying to hide away from the light of the day and the ferocious way Alice was pummelling her to get her up.</p><p>“I’m not fucking kidding, Rio! Get up! We need to get you ready. Now.”</p><p>Rio huffed and slapped Alice’s hands away where they continued to hit and grab at her.</p><p>“Stop! Stop! I have a free morning. You said. You <em>promised</em>.”</p><p>“Yes but that was until we got tickets!”</p><p>“Tickets?”</p><p>Rio huffed as Alice managed to rip the blankets from her with a triumphant grin.</p><p>“Jen just called. We’re going to see <em>No Heaven Like This</em>. Agatha got us tickets.”</p>

<em>"Jen just called. We're going to see No Heaven Like This. Agatha got us tickets."</em>
</p><p>“She did what?”</p><p>Rio’s head was spinning suddenly and it could only be for one of three reasons:</p><p>The amount of champagne she’d had last night<br/>
The fact that Alice had just heaved her into a seated position<br/>
The idea that after what Rio remembered to be a throwaway comment, Agatha Harkness had gone out of her way to secure Rio (and apparently Alice) entry to the hottest premiere in town</p><p>Perhaps it was all three.</p><p>“She got us tickets, you idiot. Get up! Get up!”</p><p>Alice was already hurrying to grab Rio’s phone, taking it upon herself to use Rio’s WhatsApp as a means to encourage the glam squad to be over sooner rather than later.</p><p>“We have an hour.”</p><p>“An <em>hour</em>?!” Rio yelled out in horror; the idea of showing up to Agatha’s premiere looking less than perfect suddenly lightly a fire beneath her ass as she threw herself from the bed.</p><p>“I <em>told</em> you to get up.”</p><p>The next hour was one of the fastest hours of Rio’s life.</p><p>She had four people working on her at once.</p><p>At least eight hands on her at all times.</p><p>Usually in moments like this Alice would comment on how this would be Rio’s dream date situation but there wasn’t even time for jokes.</p><p>Rio was deathly hungover and had time only for small sips of coffee in between lipstick application or the rouging of her cheeks to make her look less than the grey that she felt.</p><p>She’d long since decided that her hangover was partially alcohol-driven and partially a certain queasiness that had set in at the idea of Agatha personally inviting her to the premiere.</p><p>When she’d hardly asked.</p><p>When she barely knew her.</p><p>When she’d spent all night trying not to stare at toned arms or fall into intoxicating pools of blue.</p><p>Alice had been in her ear all morning about the benefits of being friendly with everybody’s favourite actress.</p><p>She’d been waxing poetic about Agatha’s power in the industry and how Rio would be smart to keep close, to keep her on side.</p><p>But Rio was at a loss for how to do that when apparently she was already on side - if the invites were anything to go by.</p><p>But then, in the back of her mind she knew, Agatha was the competition.</p><p>Not three days ago <em>Variety</em> had released an article about the early Oscar contenders and there, front and centre in the four-page spread, were photos of her and Agatha at different red carpet events. Both smiling, both the ones to watch in the Oscar race.</p><p>Maybe it was psychological warfare.</p><p>Maybe Agatha was trying to psych Rio out.</p><p>After all, <em>No Heaven Like This</em> was supposedly a masterpiece.</p><p>So making Rio watch it in a room full of the most influential people in the industry, watch Agatha receive what was sure to be a ten-minute-plus standing ovation for it, that was cruelty rather than kindness.</p><p>But despite Rio knowing that Agatha was an incredible actress she couldn’t bring herself to believe that the way she’d looked at her last night had been anything but kind, or interested, or in the very least, polite.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>The makeup artist huffed in a way that Rio didn’t think she would if she were currently plastering lipstick on Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“Stop fidgeting.”</p><p>Rio grimaced in embarrassment and apologised quickly as she tried to focus back in on the task at hand.</p><p>Look good.</p><p>Look good for Agatha.</p><p>She mentally chastised herself as her hair stylist combed through her dark flop of hair, and could no longer look herself in the eye in the mirror.</p><p>Perhaps having a crush on someone so unattainable wasn’t the best option for a wannabe movie star.</p><p>Or maybe another actress would be fine.</p><p>But Rio felt things deeply, too deeply.</p><p>And Agatha was starting to take up too much of the brain space she needed to use to focus in, to nail every appearance, to charm the world.</p><p>She didn’t have time to try to charm a married mother of one.</p><p>Or to think.</p><p>As soon as she was deemed acceptable, she was wrestled into a little white dress and heels, and thrown a bag with her phone and then marched with Alice to the waiting car outside.</p><p>Rio didn’t even have time to register the pretty receptionist shooting her a megawatt smile on her way out.</p><p>“The press conference afterwards. You need to pay attention to how Agatha handles it,” Alice was saying in the back of the car with Rio.</p><p>“Press conference? We surely can’t-…”</p><p>“Well maybe you can’t but I can.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and smirked a little at her determined friend.</p><p>“Jen?”</p><p>“She’ll help, I’m sure of it.”</p><p>“You’re the competition.”</p><p>“So? You’re the competition too and Agatha got you in.”</p><p>But Rio turned away, unwilling to express her fears that that might not have been a kindness.</p><p>“Rio? She’s a better friend than you could find anywhere else. Don’t fuck it up, okay? We’re on the cusp of greatness and Agatha <em>is</em> great.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, tried to focus on what had happened last night.</p><p>How had she broached the topic of Agatha’s premiere? Had she asked for a ticket?</p><p>Everything still felt a little hazy by the time they were pulling up to the red carpet outside the theatre.</p><p>With some final words of encouragement, Rio was able to put on her best smile and saunter in.</p><p>The place was overrun.</p><p>They were some of the last in and the usher was reluctant to show them to their seats.</p><p>“Listen, kid. I’m telling you that these seats were reassigned to us.”</p><p>Rio had been trapped by a well-meaning journalist who she’d spoken to several times over the years but she could still hear Alice’s voice through the noise of the crowd.</p><p>As the journalist asked her how she was enjoying the festival she felt her stomach drop and fear clutch at her heart.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t got them seats at all.</p><p>“I’m <em>telling</em> you. It’s-…”</p><p>“What’s happening here?”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped around when she heard Jen join the mix and she missed the journalist’s high praise of her latest <em>Vanity Fair</em> piece.</p><p>Jen wouldn’t prank Alice.</p><p>Agatha would prank Rio. But Jen wouldn’t prank Alice.</p><p>So she turned back and tried to drown out the urgent conversation of the two women beside her in favour of the man who’d once felt so sorry for her after arriving at a press junket and seeing her tired and miserable that instead of asking questions about the movie he asked her about basketball.</p><p>She’d give this man an exclusive on anything just for that.</p><p>“Vidal,” came Jen’s voice through the noise, cutting Rio off where she was telling the journalist about her plans for the next few days - what she could remember from Alice’s oft-repeated itinerary anyway.</p><p>“Quick. It’ll start soon.”</p><p>Rio excused herself politely and turned to Jennifer and a smug looking Alice.</p><p>“Don’t get used to this special treatment. She must have still been drunk when she called me this morning. It was a huge headache to get you both in here. I must have pissed off a hell of a lot of people. But she insisted. So.”</p><p>Jen looked furious.</p><p>Rio wondered how Alice was holding up about it.</p><p>But she didn’t have time to ponder the very intricate dynamics of their strange situationship because the lights were dimming and that meant the cast and crew would soon be arriving.</p><p>“Straight down, the two seats in the middle,” Jen pointed out, and Rio followed Alice down the row until they found the two remaining seats in the theatre that weren’t the exclusive front row.</p><p>Usually in a movie theatre Rio would opt for a back row seat where she was less likely to be observed by the curious fan. She’d also opt for a bucket of popcorn the size of a small child and a soda large enough to drown in.</p><p>But in this instance, the sight of Agatha Harkness striding in hand in hand with her director would be enough to satisfy her.</p><p>Agatha was wearing a pale blue suit with a crisp white shirt and she looked devastating.</p><p>She was beaming as she walked along the row and for a heart-stopping moment she locked eyes with Rio.</p><p>It was brief, and if it had been anyone else looking at her like that, Rio might not have noticed.</p><p>But it was Agatha so she noticed everything.</p><p>She might not have believed she’d even looked her way except for the fact that Agatha knew where she was sitting, because she’d gone to the effort of placing her there.</p><p>But the moment was gone and the filmmakers all had their seats, and Rio realised with a jolt that she could see Agatha still, the blue standing out even as the lights dimmed.</p><p>She was five rows behind her, diagonally positioned so if Rio turned her head only slightly she could stare at the back of Agatha’s head for the next two and a half hours.</p><p>Then Agatha moved as the director stood to introduce the movie to the expectant crowd.</p><p>And Rio could just see her profile.</p><p>The curve of Agatha’s nose was something that even the gods must envy, that Rio wanted to trace it with her fingers and brush it with her lips.</p><p>Agatha was made from something divine, something that mere mortals could only dream of emulating.</p><p>But the director was finishing and the crowd applauded as the lights dimmed completely and Agatha was lost to Rio as she turned back to the front.</p><p>Alice reached for Rio’s hand and squeezed it gently, shooting her a smile as the first titles came on.</p><p>For two hours Rio felt breathless with the intensity of the storyline, of the cinematography.</p><p>The movie unfurled before the silent audience; splitting open like a fresh wound as Agatha portrayed a mother losing a child with such precision that it was almost unbearable to watch.</p><p>Only it wasn’t.</p><p>It was compelling in a way that meant nobody blinked, nobody moved.</p><p>Every fractured breath, every cut to soulful blue eyes, every shot of Agatha bled with emotion. It made Rio grieve with her. Made her yearn to reach that part of her that could produce such a performance.</p><p>It was masterful, it was magic.</p><p>Hauntingly raw and real and remarkable.</p><p>As the camera faded to black after lingering on the final shot of Agatha, lone on a hillside, her wild hair billowing behind her as she stared into the distance, the crowds began to move.</p><p>Like a living beast, they rose together, spreading their thunderous applause through the theatre.</p><p>The cameras rolled in and suddenly Agatha was on the screen, looking more glamorous than she had in the throes of her performance.</p><p>And Rio hollered with the rest of the crowd, her hands already hurting from the ferocity of her applause.</p><p>Alice beside her was on her tiptoes, giving as good as Rio beside her.</p><p>Agatha was beaming, looking every which way but at the camera that stayed intrusively close to her face.</p><p>Whether truly shy or expertly putting on the pretence, she kept her gaze away from the lens and focused on her director, the producer her other side, and then the people directly behind her.</p><p>The standing ovation lasted for fourteen minutes, not a record at Cannes, but close enough.</p><p>As the noise died down, Rio could feel the sting of her hands and her eyes from the tears shed during the screening.</p><p>Alice looked distraught beside her and Rio wondered if it were because the movie had moved her so or because she knew any hope of an Oscar for Rio was dead on arrival.</p><p>The Oscar was surely Agatha’s to take.</p><p>A festival worker came out and instructed those who had press credentials to follow the usher at the exit of the theatre.</p><p>And as people began to move, the front row of filmmakers started to exit before everyone, Rio turned to see Agatha looking up at her, her blue eyes questioning and Rio just shook her head in disbelief down at her.</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into a grin that Rio matched and even as her director tried for Agatha’s attention her eyes lingered on Rio for a few seconds longer before she turned away.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said close to her ear, “I’m going to sneak in. Go back to the hotel. Stay in the room. Order up lunch. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, feeling Alice gently push her towards the exit.</p><p>Rio was one of the few who left ahead of the press conference and without Alice to tell her otherwise, she refused the ride back to the hotel and instead took the scenic route home.</p><p>She needed some air to shake off the lingering impact of the movie.</p><p>And the fresh, crisp air of the town soothed her down from where her her mind was still with Agatha’s character in the depths of her grief.</p><p>Rio knew that she was a good actress. she knew she could command a stage and wow a cast and crew with her talent - especially when earlier on in her career she’d been typecast as a manic pixie dream girl, an actress who could play sexy whilst being a ‘cool girl’.</p><p>“Beautiful but doesn’t know was often in her earlier character descriptions somewhere.</p><p>She, and Alice, had rallied against it until, eventually, she’d been handed a breakout role in a little indie film only two years ago.</p><p>The director, female because of course, had seen something in her that Rio hadn’t even seen in herself.</p><p>The role was grittier, darker than she’d ever played. And although it didn’t get much awards attention, an Indie Spirit being the only award Rio was nominated for (though there was <em>some</em> buzz), it had allowed her access to the Hollywood elite.</p><p>She’d been considered suddenly by directors and producers, and even fellow actors were beginning to take notice.</p><p>So Rio had spent the last two years moving from film set to film set, terrified that she’d lose her chance if she didn’t work her ass off.</p><p>But Agatha, and Rio hated that she knew this, hated that she’d read her Wikipedia several times, was built for this and her name had been in the Awards circuit for practically as long as she’d been in the industry.</p><p>She came from a wealthy family, went to all the best schools, knew all the right people.</p><p>But she could also act rings around anyone she was on screen with.</p><p>And <em>No Heaven Like This</em> truly was her ultimate triumph. A perfect combination of a director knowing what to do with everything she could give and the indefatigable talent of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>And though Rio wanted to speak to her, to pick her brains to try to unravel and understand how she ticked, how she could possibly have achieved such greatness, she knew she’d be a bumbling mess in front of her if she spoke now.</p><p>So the sea breeze was a welcome balm to her crazed mind.</p><p>Maybe she could write her a note. Maybe that would be how she could get across just how in awe of her she was.</p><p>But it wasn’t exactly the ‘cool girl’ thing to do, so Rio turned onto the main drag before the beach and began to consider how she could ever revert to type in the presence of Agatha Harkness and be cool enough to be able to speak to her as not some fawning fangirl with a crush but as a peer with some talent of her own.</p><p>A peer whose own movie was premiering the next day.</p><p>“Hey! Hey! Rio!”</p><p>Rio startled some from where she’d been focused on the horizon line as she walked to towards the beach. Torn from her idle thoughts of Agatha by a male voice.</p><p>She turned and raised her brows at the sight of a tall man, manoeuvring his way clumsily around the woven chairs outside a chic little cafe to get to her.</p><p>Ralph.</p><p>“Hey, you alone? Come join me! Coffee’s good!”</p><p>Rio had no chance to refuse as she was treated to a megawatt smile and the chivalrous offer of a seat pulled out for her at one of the little tables where Ralph had clearly been enjoying a coffee and a pastry on his own.</p><p>“Thank you,” she muttered softly, taking a seat and brushing down her little dress over her thighs.</p><p>“Were you at the premier?” He asked with that same grin plastered across his face.</p><p>This must work on other women, she thought.</p><p>Must work on Agatha.</p><p>“I was. Didn’t feel like it?”</p><p>The waiter appeared by her side and offered a menu. Rio took it and smiled her thanks before focusing back in on Ralph who’d taken it upon himself to order for her: “Two champagnes, please. Merci.”</p><p>Ralph’s French word of thanks was spoken with the kind of cloying American crassness that made Rio cringe but she kept her smile up on her face, refusing to be accused of being impolite to the husband of the woman who had just done her an inexplicable favour.</p><p>“Merci,” she repeated, with a much more agreeable accent than Ralph’s.</p><p>The waiter disappeared and Rio turned expectantly back to the man who’d ordered alcohol for her at eleven in the morning.</p><p>“Champagne?”</p><p>“When in Rome!” He said with a grin, leaning back in his chair and slipping his glasses back onto his face.</p><p>He looked even more handsome.</p><p>Rio hated him.</p><p>“But no. Never really been a movie fan.”</p><p>“Your wife is one of the most celebrated actresses of-…”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s her thing. I’d never expect her to come to one of my conferences.”</p><p>Rio had to fight to keep her face neutral, unsure how Ralph could compare a financial conference to the premier of one of the best movies ever put on the silver screen.</p><p>“Well you missed out. She was incredible. <em>It</em> was incredible,” she corrected herself.</p><p>“I’ve heard,” he said with a bored lilt to his voice.</p><p>Rio raised her brows and tilted her head as she took in the luckiest son of a bitch in the world.</p><p>This guy should be worshipping the ground Agatha walked on. He should be singing her praises and following her around ready to give her everything and anything she needed.</p><p>And here he was, in a seafront cafe, sitting ordering champagne with another woman, barely acknowledging Agatha’s impressive career.</p><p>Or how beautiful she was.</p><p>Or the way her eyes sparkled when she smiled.</p><p>Or how soft her hands were.</p><p>Or how-…</p><p>Ralph was speaking again.</p><p>“So, Rio. Is that your real name? Or a stage name? Like Elton John?”</p><p>The waiter arrived and delivered the champagne with a smile. Rio thanked him in soft French while Ralph said nothing.</p><p>“It’s my real name.”</p><p>“Different,” he said absently, though Rio felt his gaze drop slightly further south of her face and she took a sip of her champagne just to have something to do.</p><p>Just so she wouldn’t slap him.</p><p>It was as she turned her gaze to the view of the beach before them that she noticed something she should have been more cognisant of.</p><p>Something that should have made her second guess sitting down in the first place.</p><p>Something that should have made her refuse the champagne.</p><p>Across the way there were three photographers all with their eyes on the little twosome outside the cafe, all with their cameras hanging around their necks.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Sitting having a champagne with the husband of Agatha Harkness whilst she was in the middle of a press conference wasn’t a good look.</p><p>“Ralph,” Rio said suddenly, “I think I should go. I shouldn’t have sat down. There’s paps over there and-…”</p><p>But Ralph had reached forwards and placed his hand over Rio’s and Rio just knew that if the photographers had been waiting for their shot then this was it.</p><p>She pulled her hand away quickly.</p><p>“Come on, don’t deny me the chance to drink champagne with a pretty girl by the sea.”</p><p>Perhaps Ralph himself should have been enough deterrent for her to sit down.</p><p>“I should go.”</p><p>She stood quickly and Ralph didn’t stand with her as she did.</p><p>“Thanks for the champagne.”</p><p>Through his glasses Rio thought she saw Ralph’s eyes flash angrily but she didn’t hang around to see.</p><p>She simply turned away and strode off, deciding that perhaps she should do now what Alice had told her to do earlier.</p><p>She should go to her hotel room and do nothing.</p><p>So she did.</p><p>Only doing nothing meant she had time to worry about what had just happened with Ralph.</p><p>Which seemed crazy, no? She was out and proud - one of the few actresses to be so.</p><p>They couldn’t spin this, surely.</p><p>They couldn’t make out that Rio was having an affair with the great Agatha Harkness’s husband.</p><p>But, of course they could.</p><p>Rivals at the festival, rivals in awards season, Rio could be made out to be trying to sabotage Agatha’s relationship to get under her skin.</p><p>Alice would kill her.</p><p>But more than that, more than her impending murder and her character assassination by the pestilential press, was her concern over Agatha’s reaction.</p><p>The woman had gone out of her way to get Rio and Alice the hottest tickets in town.</p><p>And Rio had spent the length of the movie marvelling at her talent, stupefied by the force of her gravitational pull even through the screen.</p><p>And now she’d repaid her by embarrassing her.</p><p>Alice arrived an hour later and Rio hated that she was so happy because she knew she wouldn’t be when Rio told her what she’d done.</p><p>“God she nails it every time. She’s so fucking good, Rio. So fucking good. You wouldn’t believe how she handled those questions.”</p><p>But Alice had spotted Rio’s tortured expression and stopped where she was mid-stride, “What? What happened?”</p><p>“I think they got pictures of me and Ralph.”</p><p>“Ralph?”</p><p>“Ralph. Agatha’s Ralph.”</p><p>Alice raised her brows, unable to compute what Rio might have been caught doing with Ralph that would lead to this reaction.</p><p>“We had champagne on the front and he held my hand. Very! Very briefly! But I spotted the photographers and I just <em>know</em>…”</p><p>“Fuck, Rio. I told you to come straight back.”</p><p>Rio grimaced and ran both hands through her hair which looked significantly more dishevelled than it had this morning.</p><p>Alice was already fishing out her phone.</p><p>“He stopped me and I thought we’d just get a coffee and then he-…”</p><p>“I’ll call Jen. I knew your flirting would get us in trouble one day but-…”</p><p>“I was <em>not</em> flirting, Alice. He’s a <em>man</em>, in case you hadn’t noticed. And he’s with Agatha. He’s married to Agatha Harkness! I don’t do married and I’d be a fucking fool to-…!”</p><p>“Okay, okay. Fine. Relax. It was innocent. I’ll call now. Just… just don’t move.”</p><p>Rio threw herself down onto one of the ridiculously large couches and groaned as Alice turned from her and quickly dialled for Jen.</p><p>Rio knew she was already on thin ice with the woman so she could only imagine her reaction to <em>this</em>.</p><p>And then she imagined Agatha’s reaction. The only reaction she found herself caring much about.</p><p>But Alice had gone into the other room and so Rio was left to her catastrophising.</p><p>It didn’t take long until she found out how much of a catastrophe this was.</p><p>“Okay. Jen’s pissed. She’s speaking to Agatha about it but she’s in press all day so it’s unlikely we’ll find out just how pissed <em>she</em> is but if it helps at all, Jen thinks she’ll mostly be mad at Ralph.”</p><p>Rio sighed and threw her forearm over her eyes, feeling like the stupidest person on the world.</p><p>“I don’t even like men,” she mumbled unhappily.</p><p>“Well our dinner with the Head of MGM has been moved.”</p><p>“Moved?”</p><p>Rio sat up suddenly, staring at Alice in surprise. Alice had worked hard to get that dinner booked into their schedule so Rio suddenly knew she’d <em>really</em> fucked up.</p><p>“Alice-…”</p><p>“Moved restaurant,” Alice clarified, taking a seat by Rio’s feet and focusing on her phone.</p><p>“Agatha’s also out for dinner. We’re arranging a happenstance meeting between you two. Getting a photographer to capture it. You’re going to smile and hug and pretend like you’re the best of friends.”</p><p>Rio swallowed down something heavy in her throat. It felt a lot like her heart.</p><p>“Jen’s a genius,” Alice added with just a hint of smugness about it.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Ralph will be there too. A quick two kiss cheek. Polite, friendly. There’s no story here.”</p><p>Rio paled a little as she watched her friend in silence, watching the little frown appear between her brows.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Alice. I didn’t mean to. It was just… I was being polite.”</p><p>“I know,” Alice said softly, “I told Jen.”</p><p>She looked up and Rio knew then that Alice wasn’t mad anymore. She felt a little better.</p><p>“Do you think she’ll be mad?”</p><p>“She has a reputation for a reason.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and felt the light pressure of a hand on her calf, “Hey. We’ll spin the close friend narrative.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes opened again as Alice removed her hand from her leg but she saw she was still looking at her.</p><p>“How did you convince her to get you those tickets?”</p><p>“I have no idea. I barely remember telling her we hadn’t managed to get any.”</p><p>“Well however you charmed her last night you’ll just have to charm her again.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly and then flopped onto her back again and sighed heavily, “Fuck. Fucking paps. Should be illegal.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Alice said quietly, “What’s a married man doing holding the hand of a young actress?”</p><p>Rio felt a white hot fury flash through her suddenly. The reminder of Ralph’s disinterest in his wife’s work making her feel anger like never before.</p><p>Alice was right. This was <em>Ralph’s</em> fault.</p><p>“He wasn’t exactly fawning over her. Had no interest in her movie.”</p><p>“Prick,” Alice said as she turned her attention back to her phone. “I get that he’s hot and rich but… so’s she. She could get anyone.”</p><p>Rio just hummed quietly, closing her eyes again as she thought back to the way Agatha had grinned at her at the premiere.</p><p>She’d probably never get that treatment from her again.</p><p>Rio couldn’t shake the dread at seeing Agatha for the rest of the day.</p><p>Even Alice’s gentle reassurances didn’t help. Alice was convinced that Rio could turn this whole thing around with her easy charm.</p><p>Or maybe she was just saying that to get Rio through the afternoon’s press round.</p><p>Because Rio hadn’t known how she’d charmed Agatha into getting them tickets in the first place so Rio was less sure she’d be able to do it again.</p><p>In fact, by the time they were pulling up to the restaurant, Rio was convinced the best thing she could do would be to turn around and take the first flight out of Cannes.</p><p>“You’re being hysterical.”</p><p>“You said it yourself: Agatha has a reputation for a reason.”</p><p>“She won’t do anything in public. And I’ll know from Jen by the time we go to bed how she’s feeling. Just try to relax, okay? You need to be convincing. <em>And</em> you need to be at the top of your game for MGM. So suck it up, buttercup.”</p><p>Rio huffed and began toying with her hair which made Alice slap her hand.</p><p>But press waits for no woman. And so Rio Vidal <em>had</em> to suck it up.</p><p>She thankfully was partnered with her director for the majority of the afternoon’s interviews so had someone to rely upon whenever she felt like she was flagging or her mind was drifting to the other rooms in the hotel where surely Agatha was answering similar, boring questions.</p><p>They had time to change and refresh makeup once the last of the interviews was done, but no glam squad this time.</p><p>Which meant that Rio crowded Alice in her little bathroom and kept prying to see if she knew just how mad Agatha was.</p><p>Alice knew nothing. Only that Agatha would be in the restaurant already by the time they arrived.</p><p>So, when Rio stepped out onto the sidewalk not twenty minutes later after a short journey from the hotel to the restaurant, she found that her body moved without her brain having to tell her to do so.</p><p>The maitre d’ greeted her and Alice and Rio only had to raise her head to see a pair of familiar eyes on her.</p><p>Agatha was wearing the same suit she’d had on that morning for the premiere only she’d draped her jacket over the back of her chair and had rolled her white sleeves up to her elbows.</p><p>Rio’s gaze fell to her forearms and she saw them flex slightly where she sat, and found herself wishing she’d strangle her just so she could see them do that up close.</p><p>Ralph was beside her and an unknown man sat opposite her, beside Jen.</p><p>Agatha raised from her seat as Rio and Alice approached and she smiled a smile that made Rio’s heart skip a beat.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha announced making Rio almost stumble where she got closer.</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Agatha had wrapped her arms around her and Rio couldn’t believe that Agatha Harkness was pressed against her all of a sudden.</p><p>She’d expected a typical European greeting of a two cheek kiss and had prepared herself for <em>that</em> but not this.</p><p>Not Agatha’s strong hold and the fingers that rested on the skin at the base of her neck, the hand on her lower back, pressing her close.</p><p>Rio was sure Agatha would be able to feel her heart beating erratically against her ribcage, beating so hard and fast as if it were trying to escape its cage and nestle in beside Agatha’s.</p><p>But she managed to wrap her arms around Agatha too, holding on just enough so she didn’t look as surprised and useless as she felt.</p><p>“Smile,” came a voice close to her ear, soft and gentle, just for her, “pretend you’re happy to see me.”</p><p>“I am,” Rio murmured back, feeling Agatha already pulling away when Rio could have held onto her like this forever.</p><p>She managed to keep her smile on her face as Agatha pulled her top half away, their hips pressed together in a hold that made Rio flush a little at the intimacy of it.</p><p>Agatha looked at her curiously, and it was a sign of her talent as an actress that she managed to maintain her grin.</p><p>“What are the chances.”</p><p>Rio forced a laugh that sounded, to her ringing ears, genuine.</p><p>And then Agatha was releasing her hold on her and Rio knew it was her cue to go to Ralph and greet him too.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hand drift down her arm as she stepped around her and was surprised when she felt soft fingers curl around her own and squeeze her as she leant up to kiss the cheeks of the man that had caused this mess.</p><p>Her greeting of Ralph was practised politeness and by the look on his face, she knew he’d been warned that two light kisses to Rio’s cheeks were all he’d be allowed to do.</p><p>But if he’d stuck his tongue down her throat, Rio wouldn’t have even noticed, because Agatha still had her hand. The hold was so light, so tentative around her fingers that she wasn’t sure who now was holding on to who.</p><p>But Alice had moved in and was motioning for Rio to follow her so she only had time to shoot Jen and the unnamed man a quick smile before she stepped away.</p><p>Her hand remained in Agatha’s as she swept past and their hold on each other only dropped when Rio stepped from around her.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure why she’d done it but maybe it was a means of making sure she were anchoring Rio away from her husband, of reminding her of her place.</p><p>Still, her fingers tingled with the electricity of Agatha’s touch even as they now hung useless at her side.</p><p>But they’d stepped away to the table in the corner and as Rio sat down opposite Alice, her best friend whispered across at her: “Nicely done. He got the shots.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, flexing her fingers subtly over the table as she tried to calm her still racing heart.</p><p>From where they now sat waiting on their guest, Rio had a direct view of Agatha if she turned to the left.</p><p>It was too tempting. And so she didn’t.</p><p>She kept her gaze on Alice, on the table, on her water glass, on anything but the woman she so badly wanted to look across at.</p><p>Within five minutes, Rio’s heart rate had calmed down again and their guest had arrived.</p><p>Unfortunately for Rio, she had to look up when he did and saw that he’d stopped at Agatha’s table to greet the future two-time Oscar winner.</p><p>Just a few hours, Rio thought to herself as she watched Agatha kiss the man’s cheeks, and smile up at him, until she’d know how badly she’d fucked up.</p><p>She’d find out how angry Agatha truly was.</p><p>And whether she’d ever get to hug her again.</p><p><em>Pathetic</em>, she thought more bitterly, clenching her teeth as she saw Agatha introduce Ralph to one of the most important men in Hollywood.</p><p>It was two minutes later, as Ralph reached over to shake the hand of Tony Stark, that she caught Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>Rio sucked a sharp breath in, seeing that Agatha’s smile had indeed been fake earlier.</p><p>Because right now she looked less than happy, she looked angry.</p><p>Rio looked away quickly, unable to handle the guilt that settled in her stomach.</p><p>But Stark was soon at their table and Rio had to push whatever she felt about her current situation down to focus in on the man who could make or break careers.</p><p>She’d met Stark before, had even had a drink with him once at a party. But this was the first time she’d had his undivided attention for a whole hour and a half: as promised by his wife and right hand woman, Pepper.</p><p>Rio had no problem being charming for Stark and found his easy manners and bawdy wit to be a welcome distraction from her horror that she’d managed to burn down a tentative friendship with her longest running crush with a misjudged attempt at being polite.</p><p>With a promise to keep in touch with Alice, Stark left and Rio was lavished with compliments by her best friend for her ability to charm the pants off of anyone.</p><p>Which felt ironic to Rio as she was so tragically aware that Agatha were still at dinner just a few feet away, furious with her.</p><p>“She’s pissed,” Rio whispered, ignoring Alice’s compliments.</p><p>Alice’s smile froze on her face and then she shot a quick glance around at Agatha’s table, seeing that whoever they’d been with before had gone and left just the three people there.</p><p>“Come with me.”</p><p>“Alice, <em>no</em>.”</p><p>“Come on. Best do it now.”</p><p>And Alice was moving so Rio had no choice but to follow.</p><p>She hung back a little, unwilling to be exposed to Agatha’s wrath when she’d started the morning with a different belief about the state of their relationship.</p><p>“Hey, how was your meal?”</p><p>Rio cringed at Alice’s opening line and settled by her side, wondering why she’d had two glasses of red and not any tequila.</p><p>Or arsenic.</p><p>“Well as planned pap shots go it was the most delicious,” Jen offered with a smile as she took a sip of her wine.</p><p>“I’m sorry about that,” Rio said quickly, suddenly desperate to get her guilt off her chest.</p><p>“I didn’t-…”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha said quickly, and Rio glanced down to see Agatha swirling her glass of wine, her gaze somewhere off in the distance.</p><p>Jen cleared her throat and leant across the table to Alice, her hand landing just inches from where she stood, “I’ll call you later, okay?”</p><p>Rio reacted sooner than Alice did and reached for her friend’s arm, tugging her away quickly so they could disappear from this ill-advised interaction.</p><p>They paused briefly at the maitre d’ and Alice quickly paid the bill, both now avoiding looking back at the three people they’d just hurried away from.</p><p>They were silent on the journey back to their hotel, both lost in their own thoughts of the relationships that they may have lost due to a miscalculation.</p><p>When they arrived back to their room Rio wondered why she felt so sick with the idea of Agatha being angry at her.</p><p>She’d not technically done anything wrong. She’d only put herself in a stupid situation. She’d only tried to be polite to a man she would otherwise rather ignore, potentially punch.</p><p>Agatha must know that.</p><p>Agatha can’t have thought she’d be cruel enough or stupid enough to try something with her husband.</p><p>Alice looked as if she were suffering as much as Rio was and for that reason, when they arrived back in the suite, Rio excused herself and went to take a long hot bath.</p><p>She couldn’t handle the fact that she may have also ruined Alice’s chance at a relationship with Jen.</p><p>She stayed soaking for close to two hours, constantly topping up the bath with hot water so she could prolong the inevitable - facing Alice again.</p><p>By the time she’d summoned up the courage to step back into their shared living space Alice had also been soaking in her own tub for a while, she looked up at Rio with a small, sad frown.</p><p>“I haven’t heard from Jen yet.”</p><p>Rio only nodded silently and went to take a seat beside Alice on the couch, reaching an arm around her to pull her into her side.</p><p>“Jen is totally head over heels for you. She-…”</p><p>There was a faint knock at the door and both women on the couch looked up in surprise.</p><p>Alice moved over, squeezing Rio’s thigh as she pushed herself up and Rio sat forwards having a hunch who it might be knocking on their door so late at night.</p><p>She was right.</p><p>“Hey,” Jen said, a little breathlessly, and Rio wandered if she were nervous and if she’d been as worried about her future relationship with Alice as Alice had been.</p><p>“Can I come in?”</p><p>Alice could only nod and Rio felt a twang of affection for her best friend.</p><p>“Rio. Hey.”</p><p>Rio nodded and stood, placing her hands in the back pockets of her shorts.</p><p>“Jen. How is… is everything okay?”</p><p>Jen glanced at Alice and then nodded, taking it upon herself to move further into the room and take a seat at the couch opposite where Rio was.</p><p>Alice hesitated for a second before she went to take a seat by Rio and Jen cleared her throat a little at this choice but swallowed down whatever she was about to say and replaced it with: “Agatha’s pissed but she’s mostly pissed at Ralph. She thinks you’re a fool, obviously, but… she’s pissed at Ralph.”</p><p>Rio felt her heart leap into her throat as she stared across at Jen, vaguely aware that she was now telling Alice about a call she’d made to her press contacts, about how she’d sourced the photographers who’d taken the photos and firstly talked them down and secondly bought the photos off them - for a much lower price than they were initially going to try and flog them for.</p><p>“I… wait,” Rio said suddenly, her brain still focused on the most important news - that Agatha wasn’t annoyed at her.</p><p>“You got the photos?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then… they won’t run the photos of us in the restaurant either?”</p><p>“No. There’s no need. Agatha’s reputation is safe and yours is fine too.”</p><p>Rio started a little, wondering if she could get a hold of those photos. Wondering if she could get Agatha to sign them. Wondering if Agatha would ever hold her like that again.</p><p>“So… so she’s not mad.”</p><p>“Oh, she’s mad. Ralph’s flying back home tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and looked down at her hands, distractedly cracking her knuckles as she thought this over.</p><p>“Did he make a move?”</p><p>Rio felt Alice shift beside her, her hand unconsciously reaching for Rio’s wrist, whether in a protective move or to stop her cracking her knuckles, Rio wasn’t sure. Maybe both.</p><p>“A move? I… no. Does Agatha think he did?”</p><p>“He held your hand… it’s logical to think he may have made a move.”</p><p>And then Rio realised why Agatha had held her hand earlier.</p><p>She’d been worried Ralph had made a move and Rio would be concerned it might happen again.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Rio’s mind was reeling, her whole body felt hot suddenly and she stood up from her couch, striding from the room to stand out on the balcony where at least she could get some air.</p><p>Not only had she almost caused a PR disaster for Agatha Harkness but she’d almost ruined a marriage.</p><p>She’d fantasised about Agatha being suddenly single, suddenly interested.</p><p>But the reality was different.</p><p>Everyone knew that Agatha and Ralph were a golden couple.</p><p>Rio had a crush but she wasn’t selfish enough to want them to break up.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>“God,” she heard from just behind her, “actresses are so dramatic.”</p><p>Rio looked over her shoulder at Jen and raised her brows.</p><p>The woman stood watching her with her arms crossed over her chest, her cell phone clutched in one beautifully manicured hand.</p><p>“Ralph is a good guy… mostly. But he sometimes looks… sometimes touches… Agatha mostly turns a blind eye but… anyway.”</p><p>Rio sighed and turned back around to look out across the water. She realised she was being a little dramatic but she couldn’t help it.</p><p>It was her job, after all.</p><p>If Agatha turned a blind eye to Ralph, would Ralph turn a blind eye to Agatha too?</p><p>Was Agatha sleeping around on the side? Would Agatha sleep around with her?</p><p>But, no. Now wasn’t the time to fantasise.</p><p>She was barley friends with Agatha and Agatha had given her no reason for Rio to believe she was anything other than straight anyway.</p><p>Except for one drunken memory of a night in Chicago. But even that was too hazy to be anything real.</p><p>Besides, this whole thing had ruined what she had hoped would continue to be a confusing, difficult, but totally enthralling relationship.</p><p>Because despite it all, she wanted Agatha Harkness to like her.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said from somewhere close by, “You did nothing wrong. And now it’s fixed. Relax, okay? And next time don’t sit with another famous actress’s spouse drinking champagne in one of the most photographed towns in the world.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and turned around again and in doing so she caught the look exchanged between Jen and Alice and she had to soften.</p><p>They looked so in love it was impossible not to soften with it.</p><p>Her best friend was an idiot for thinking Jen might not be interested.</p><p>“Will you tell Agatha I’m sorry? And that… that I loved her movie?”</p><p>Jen’s face changed as she looked around to Rio and she scoffed before she turned her attention to her phone and Rio knew that a woman who worked for Agatha Harkness would surely be busy every minute of the day.</p><p>“Tell her yourself. Alice, I should go. Agatha wants to prep for tomorrow.”</p><p>Jen looked up then and dropped her phone slightly, “But drinks? Tomorrow evening?”</p><p>Rio felt suddenly like she shouldn’t be here but with the door blocked back into the suite she could do nothing but turn back to the sea.</p><p>She held her breath and brought her arms in as her forearms leant on the barrier, trying to shrink herself so Jen and Alice could have some privacy.</p><p>“I… yeah! I’d love that.”</p><p>“Good. I’ll drop you a text later. We’re non-stop all day tomorrow but I should have most of the evening free.”</p><p>“Cool. I mean, great. I… yeah. Cool.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look around but she grinned to herself as she heard Jen laugh quietly and turned only when she heard Jen leave and shout over her shoulder back at her.</p><p>“Bye, Rio! Fuck up again and I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Rio raised her middle finger at the woman and smirked when she glowered at her but she caught her lips twitching.</p><p>Maybe Alice was rubbing off on her. Maybe Jen was just softer than she looked.</p><p>But Rio went back to the view so she didn’t have to see Alice fumble her way through a goodbye, or even a kiss.</p><p>Less than thirty seconds later and she felt arms around her neck and a grinning idiot of a best friend pressing her face into her hair.</p><p>“She asked me out. You heard that? Like… for drinks. On a date.”</p><p>Rio only laughed in response and grasped Alice’s hands.</p><p>“Yes, I heard.”</p><p>Alice moved around and made Rio turn to her, holding her arms as she did.</p><p>“<em>You</em> are a fool if you think she’s not entirely into you.”</p><p>“I thought <em>you</em> were the fool today.”</p><p>Rio grinned and rolled her eyes, “I’m going to write her a note. And send a gift.”</p><p>“How very romantic of you. Be sure to sign it ‘from your biggest fan, sorry about trying to fuck your husband’.”</p><p>Rio felt her cheeks colour slightly but she ignored it and ignored Alice’s teasing grin as she moved back into the safety of the living room.</p><p>“Besides, you should actually be praising me for the number I did on Stark. I think he liked me.”</p><p>“Oh,” Alice said with a slow smile, “I’ve already heard from Potts. He <em>does</em> like you and he’s keeping you in mind for his next few projects.”</p><p>Rio whipped around so quickly she almost lost her balance.</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“Do I ever joke about work?”</p><p>Rio huffed and then threw herself onto the couch.</p><p>“Sooo,” Alice continued in a slightly softer tone than before, moving around to stand before Rio and shrugging her light blazer off. “All <em>you</em> need to do is behave for the next few days. And be nice to Agatha. I want you back on her good side. And,” she draped herself on a nearby chair as Rio turned to look at her, “I might treat you.”</p><p>“Treat me?”</p><p>Alice hummed and tried to fight the smirk that threatened to give her away, but Rio knew her friend too well.</p><p>“Well… we’ve barely had a break for two years and we actually have a couple days free so I was considering taking you away.”</p><p>“Away?” Rio sat bolt up right and stared at Alice, feeling suddenly like a child promised the largest of the cookies available on the counter.</p><p>“If you get more than ten minutes’ ovation. I’ll take you away.”</p><p>“You can’t promise something and then put caveats on it.”</p><p>“Gives you something to focus on rather than spiralling about Agatha Harkness plotting to kill you.”</p><p>“You think she is?”</p><p>Alice laughed at the look of panic on Rio’s face and shook her head, “Jen said she’s just pissed at Ralph. She probably already knows you’re an idiot and nothing more. You're no real threat to Agatha Harkness, come on. I bet she barely thinks about you at all.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and threw herself back again. “Whatever. <em>I</em> got into the screening. You should be thanking me.”</p><p>Alice hummed and then laughed, “Fine. I’ll treat you. With your credit card, of course. But a couple days vacation I think will be good for us, don’t you think?”</p><p>“God,” Rio said with a grin, “I knew I loved you. I just never realised how much until this very moment.”</p><p>“Ha ha,” Alice said as she tucked her legs beneath her and reached for her nearby laptop, “I’ll find us somewhere nice. But you should go to sleep. Movie’s released tomorrow. Glam are coming first thing because you need to look <em>perfect</em> for your debut.”</p><p>Rio sighed and stood up.</p><p>“Make sure it’s luxurious.”</p><p>“Oh, it will be. It’s <em>your</em> credit card, remember?”</p><p>Rio only rolled her eyes and went to leave the room, thinking only now of the soft embrace of her bed.</p><p>But the sleep she so craved didn’t quite come.</p><p>Blue eyes and an angry stare were all she could think of and her worried mind didn’t relent until it was too late and her alarm was ringing as Alice kamikazed into her room.</p><p>“Up! Up!”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, having had maybe half an hour’s proper sleep all night.</p><p>A point that Alice picked up on immediately.</p><p>“Holy shit, did you sleep <em>at all</em>?”</p><p>Rio groaned, not having the energy to argue with Alice when she could barely lift herself from the bed.</p><p>“Maybe I should have booked more than just the four of them.”</p><p>“Shut. <em>Up</em>. This is my big day, you’re supposed to be nice to me on my big day.”</p><p>“I’d be nicer if you had done me a favour and not looked like absolute-…”</p><p>But Rio shot Alice a look and her best friend softened.</p><p>“Fine. Whatever. Shower and change and be out in ten. They’re coming soon and we’ll need all the time we can get.”</p><p>With that, Alice flew from the room, and Rio was left to her tired mind and nervous body.</p><p>All hopes of the highest honour of her industry rested on today. She needed the critics to rise to their feet and applaud her, to confirm that all the hype had been real and she wasn’t just some flash in a pan when Agatha was still the whole damn meal.</p><p>So she showered and fought down her fear of being a failure before she’d even begun.</p><p>Faint concerns about Agatha’s wrath filled her subconscious still but she had no time for concerns about that when she was being poked and pulled and painted.</p><p>She forced herself to make small talk, tried her best to concentrate when Alice was prepping her for the who’s who of the press who would be front and centre, and tried to focus in on the actress she knew she could be and not the flaming mess she currently felt.</p><p>Usually confident, calm, collected, Rio stepped from the black SUV with a nauseating feeling that she was walking to the gallows.</p><p>She could barely see for the flashes of cameras that surrounded her.</p><p>The only thing now grounding her to the moment was the rough feel of her director’s hand in her own, the soft whispers of “just wait, Rio. just you wait”.</p><p>His confidence was annoying.</p><p>His belief that what they’d made together were worthy of anything made her feel worse because if he were wrong then he would be crushed.</p><p>But they were stepping into the theatre now, with it’s high bolted ceilings and the grand sweep of seats around them.</p><p>Rio’s smile was plastered on her face and she felt like one of those marionettes taken out to dance for her crowd.</p><p>She didn’t dare to look around, couldn’t bear to see the amount of people looking at her, expectant that she would dazzle them.</p><p>“Just people, Rio,” Alice always said, “Look at their faces. Just people.”</p><p>But Rio was at her seat now, her hand empty where her director had released it to deliver his mawkish and self-aggrandising introduction.</p><p>She felt small in her seat, felt like she’d shrunk an inch or two as her shoulders rose close to her ears.</p><p>She wished she could run, or that Alice had been able to sit beside her.</p><p>She wanted to be swallowed whole by the black screen in front that threatened to show her face to the world, threatened to destroy her career with the too-high expectations on her.</p><p>But then there was an outbreak of applause and Rio saw her director motion to her, waving his hands at her to bring her up, to spin her around and to show her to the room.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and almost choked on it as she was shown off to the most influential journalists in the industry.</p><p>And there, sitting beside Jen in the middle of the sea of beaming faces was Agatha.</p><p>The applause seemed to slow, seemed to merge into one, heavy crash of hands.</p><p>Agatha was looking directly at her, her own hands moving in tandem with those around her, her eyebrows raised almost as if she was wondering why she were there herself, her smile widening the longer Rio stared.</p><p>And more devastating than anything that had happened to Rio that week, she winked.</p>

<p>Two hours and twenty four minutes.</p><p>That was how long Rio didn’t breathe for.</p><p>A new record, she thought.</p><p>At least one thing to be proud of.</p><p>Because she could no longer be objective about her performance. She could no longer believe what everyone had been telling her for weeks.</p><p>All she could see was herself playing dress up on the fifty foot screen before her.</p><p>The rough, calloused pads of her director’s fingers were brushing her knuckles every now and then and that was the only thing that kept Rio from bolting.</p><p>She wanted Alice. And she wanted to be alone.</p><p>The screening ended, the movie faded to black.</p><p>The credits rolled.</p><p>There was silence for a beat.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath.</p><p>The lights went on.</p><p>The noise started.</p><p>All around her the jubilant, thunderous applause began.</p><p>She was wrenched from her seat by her director and pulled into his arms without warning.</p><p>The noise seemed to intensify suddenly, as if her brain could initially only handle part of it and had now finally given in to all of it.</p><p>But when she was released she noticed the camera was in her face already and she had to force a smile but noticed the tears forming in her eyes must be real.</p><p>She hadn’t forced those.</p><p>The camera stayed and she saw herself reflected in it, felt the hands jostling her shoulders and squeezing her waist.</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Her forced smile became real like a sudden morning light through the dusk.</p><p>Her audience was applauding her still, and Rio took a shot and turned to see, blinking owlishly to avoid letting her tears fall as her grin grew at the sight of her admirers.</p><p>Maybe the press and Alice had been right. Maybe she had a chance.</p><p>Alice was the first person she saw.</p><p>And Rio almost lost control right then and there because her best friend was crying real, proper tears.</p><p>Rio’s stomach lurched at the sight and she wanted to clamber up the two rows to get to her but all she could do was grin back at her, trying to convey to her that it was her win too.</p><p>She dared then to turn and see the rest of the crowd when she could no longer stomach watching her best friend when she couldn’t reach her.</p><p>There were faces she recognised and faces she didn’t; there were grins and smiled and appraising eyes on her from every angle.</p><p>And then there was Jennifer Kale, clapping along but leaning over and whispering urgently into the ear of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Rio caught her eye and felt her smile grow impossibly wider at the sight.</p><p>There were at least a thousand people there all clapping for Rio.</p><p>But Agatha was clapping for her too.</p><p>Agatha was smiling at her.</p><p>A hand wrapped around her waist and she was turned back around, but she looked back, just once, and over her shoulder she winked at Agatha, returning the gesture from before.</p><p>It felt heady; this new confidence she had.</p><p>She felt like she would conquer the world, like she could have anything she wanted, woo the woman who had no interest in her.</p><p>The applause lasted what felt like a lifetime after that and Rio’s cheeks felt so sore from all the smiling.</p><p>But her heart was full and she felt the drunk on the applause. And Rio recognised the secret part of herself that longed to look back at Agatha to confirm that she had been clapping, that she had been smiling, and how she’d reacted to her wink.</p><p>But as the applause began to die down, Rio was ushered out with the rest of the cast and crew and she faced straight ahead under the pretence of being cool, calm, confident.</p><p>There wasn’t time for Alice to get to her before she was ushered to her seat along the long table at the front of the little press room and Rio already felt the familiar glare of the cameras flashing all around her before the room was even half full.</p><p>“You ready for this, Vidal?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and grinned at her costar, leaning in conspiratorially to whisper to him as they took their places.</p><p>“Born ready, baby.”</p><p>Rio found Alice in the sea of faces and grinned at her as the questions began to come thick and fast.</p><p>Rio’s freshly acquired earpiece translated the languages other than English spoken in the room and this was working well until a Spanish reporter asked a question aimed at her costar.</p><p>“¿Te resultó distraído trabajar con Rio?”</p><p>“<em>Did you find it distracting working with Rio?</em>”</p><p>Only the translation that came through Rio’s earpiece wasn’t exactly right.</p><p>What Rio heard in English was instead: “Did you enjoy working with Rio?”</p><p>Without thinking, and knowing Alice would kill her if she gaged her response wrong, Rio reached for the arm of her handsome costar to stop him from answering a question that hadn’t been asked.</p><p>“Sorry,” she pulled her earpiece from her ear and looked directly at the reporter as she clarified: “¿Distrayente?” <em>Distracting?</em></p><p>“Sí, ser una mujer hermosa y todo.” <em>Yes, being a beautiful woman and all.</em></p><p>Sexist pig.</p><p>Rio could feel Alice’s eyes burning into her but she couldn’t look away because she’d lose her nerve.</p><p>“Uh,” Rio forced out a soft laugh, making herself appear less than the fury that she felt. “Steve, you’re being asked if you found me distracting? Because I’m beautiful?”</p><p>She turned to her costar and wriggled her brows, knowing she’d played it just right because the room tittered with laughter.</p><p>Steve turned to her with a slightly confused and then amused grin and Rio felt like kissing him when he responded easily, “Oh, we had a no eye contact rule so I wouldn’t melt before her and forget my lines. But we managed to make it work.”</p><p>Rio laughed again but this time it was genuine and she shot the room a megawatt grin, finding Alice in the crowd and seeing her shoot a subtle thumbs up.</p><p>Rio poked her tongue into the inside of her cheek and tried not to look too smug as the conversation moved on and talk of Rio distracting costars turned into festival gossip rather than headline fodder.</p><p>Nothing else was lost in translation so far as the rest of the press conference went and when it was over Rio was ushered into a small room where she’d have the opportunity to touch up her makeup and speak to Alice before more interviews were to go ahead.</p><p>“Risky behaviour, kid.”</p><p>“Paid off though,” Rio beamed as she pulled Alice into a tight hug.</p><p>“We’re getting you that Oscar,” Alice whispered into her ear and Rio laughed as she pulled back.</p><p>“I don’t know…”</p><p>“Twelve minutes! Twelve minutes! And Rio, it was so good. Seeing the whole thing, with your performance just…”</p><p>And Alice began to well up.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio smiled as she tenderly swiped her thumbs below Alice’s watery eyes, anticipating the tears that would soon be falling.</p><p>“No crying today. I have about a million hours of interviews today and I can’t be thinking about anything other than ‘how the industry has changed since Me Too’.”</p><p>Alice laughed and pulled away, sniffing heavily so that Rio knew she was now properly crying.</p><p>But she’d been launched at by a makeup artist so couldn’t go after Alice as she kept turned from her and focused in on her phone.</p><p>“Closed lips, please,” came the soft words of the woman now brushing Chanel across her red lips.</p><p>Rio did as she was told and briefly relaxed under the tender care of the expert hired to make her look her best.</p><p>But Alice’s voice floated back into her ears just as she was tilting her head a little more to help the artist at work.</p><p>“By the way, Jen’s pissed. She thinks you’ll take it.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and turned her head so that the makeup artist tutted at her and she grimaced in apology.</p><p>“Wha?” She mumbled, trying not to open her lips too much.</p><p>“She came in with Agatha. Didn’t you see them? Got great seats. Imagine how easy all this would be if we had their power. But she saw it and loved it and she’s pissed because of it.”</p><p>Rio felt a flush of butterflies erupt in her stomach at this. Because if Jen loved it then there was a chance that Agatha did too.</p><p>Only she was trapped by the woman working the curve of her lips and she fought against herself to not just push her off and demand Alice find out Agatha’s opinion.</p><p>Another thirty seconds went by that felt like a lifetime and the woman had moved away to fetch a bronzer from her bag and Rio turned to Alice and said in such a rush that she wondered how Alice had understood her: “And Agatha what did Agatha think of it?”</p><p>Alice turned from where she was now sitting in a little director’s chair behind one of the cameras already set up, “Agatha? I don’t know. I’m sure she liked it. It was great, Rio.”</p><p>Rio sighed but said nothing else as she allowed her head to be turned by the makeup artist and her cheeks were painted with bronze.</p><p>She began twisting her hair in her fingers as a means to distract herself from the torturous mystery of Agatha’s opinion on her movie.</p><p>Perhaps her smile in the theatre had been nothing more than a friendly reassurance. Maybe she was smiling because she <em>hated</em> it or thought Rio was unbelievable as a woman on the brink of a breakdown, vulnerable and looking in all the wrong places for reassurance.</p><p>Maybe she just thought she was a hack.</p><p>But Rio sailed through the questions thrown at her - mostly because they were all variations on a theme so it didn’t take my brain power to do it - and she had thirty seconds in between to take a sip of coffee or have her lipstick reapplied.</p><p>Alice remained a silent observer, occasionally reminding Rio of a point she might want to bring up at the next interview or else telling her what bar she might meet Jen at later - the decision always changing.</p><p>And Rio floated through, her mind often elsewhere as she smiled and charmed and chatted.</p><p>She was thinking of the quiet evening she could have with Alice out with Jen.</p><p>She thought of where Alice might whisk her away to on vacation now it was confirmed that she’d had over ten minutes of applause.</p><p>She thought of Agatha now in Cannes alone, living down the hall of their swanky hotel, and the smile she’d given her that morning.</p><p>At around three, Rio was done with the junket and had moved on to a longer form interview with a journalist from <em>Vogue</em> which was to take place in a nearby restaurant.</p><p>Starving now and a little grumpy because of it, it took Alice breaking the surprise of their vacation to get Rio to smile again on their way to the location of the interview.</p><p>“Positano. Two full days, three nights. A little hillside villa with a pool.”</p><p>Rio groaned at the sight of the villa Alice had sent over to her email, flicking lustfully through the images of the place they could disappear to for two whole days.</p><p>“God, Alice. How much is this costing me?”</p><p>“Well I’ve managed to get the fridge filled and the wine fridge filled too so…” she grinned and shrugged, “I’m afraid it’s costing you quite a bit.”</p><p>Rio only laughed and tilted her head back in her seat, taking a second to fantasise about sitting by the pool with a drink in her hand.</p><p>“I don’t even care. I want to be there now.”</p><p>“Soon,” Alice promised with a smug smile as she returned her attention to her overflowing email inbox, “just a few more people to charm and we’ll be on our way.”</p><p>“Easier said than done,” Rio grumbled as the image of herself lying by the pool slowly dissolved in her mind and she was back in an air-conditioned SUV thinking about how to charm the next journalist.</p><p>Rio began to shuffle a little as they reached their destination and Alice took this as a sign that she was beginning to get tired so she placed a hand over her hand and squeezed it.</p><p>“Think of the villa. The vast amounts of wine and two days of uninterrupted pool time with your favourite person.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and rolled her eyes but the reminder did help.</p><p>In fact, it helped so much that a promised two hour interview expanded into three and Rio Vidal not only charmed the interviewer, she managed to get a promise of an even longer middle page spread printed of it.</p><p>Alice was so happy about this result that she forgot to be nervous about her impending date with Jen for the rest of the day.</p><p>The only issue was: Rio had barely had a chance to eat anything.</p><p>She’d gone easy on the wine because of it but she’d been talking so much that she’d hardly touched the food they’d ordered. The one saving grace was that her interviewer had barely eaten either so there was little concern that any mention of Rio’s appetite (or apparent lack thereof) would be mentioned in the piece.</p><p>But it also meant that Rio was <em>hangry</em> and now she was alone with Alice back in their suite she could barely see for the red mist that had descended as they waited on a rushed room service order of burgers and fries.</p><p>“I can’t eat much. I have to look my best and my <em>best</em> is not <em>bloated</em>.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and began plucking at the soft tassels on one of the cushions in her lap, “You look beautiful. Jen is lucky. Stop working yourself up.”</p><p>“Easy for you to say, you don’t have a hot date tonight. You can just-…”</p><p>“Geez, thanks, pal!”</p><p>“You know what I meant,” Alice huffed softly, kicking Rio from where she sat just up from her on the couch.</p><p>“You just get to sit here and indulge and think about that Oscar on the horizon. It’s not too early to think about speeches, you know.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and sighed as she leant back in her seat, “A nomination is the win, Alice. Didn’t you say that just two months ago?”</p><p>“Yes, but that was before everyone realised what a contender you are! Screw Agatha! You’re winning. I promise you.”</p><p>But Alice’s optimism didn’t rub off on Rio until she got her greedy hands on the burger that arrived five minutes later.</p><p>She ate without breathing, she devoured without thinking, and then she was done and she could be herself again.</p><p>“That was so impressive. Maybe we should make you do a mukbang.”</p><p>“A what?” Rio asked absently as she began to steal fries from Alice’s half-finished plate.</p><p>“Nevermind. Something to think about.”</p><p>Rio only hummed quietly, intent on her continued thieving activities.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“Do you just want my plate?”</p><p>“Yes please,” Rio said quickly, stealing the whole thing over to continue where Alice had left off.</p><p>Alice only rolled her eyes and Rio watched with a mouth full of burger as she disappeared into her room to get changed and shouted over her shoulder, “Rest up tonight, please! One more day of press and then we’re outta here.”</p><p>“Mm’kay,” Rio mumbled as she focused back in on the task at hand.</p><p>By the time Alice was back out Rio was on her back on the couch, clutching her stomach and feeling a little ashamed of herself for eating so much.</p><p>But Alice was twirling in a little black dress and grinning down at her and Rio sat up to admire the view properly.</p><p>“She’ll be putty in your hands.”</p><p>“Here’s hoping,” Alice smiled as she finished her twirl with an uncharacteristic flourish that made Rio laugh.</p><p>“Now,” she said, suddenly turning serious as she marched towards Rio and leant over her with her hands on her shoulders.</p><p>“Don’t wait up, okay? I’m hoping I’ll be back too late for you.”</p><p>“I’m hoping that too,” Rio smiled as she squeezed Alice’s forearms and grinned up at her.</p><p>“Pervert,” Alice accused with a grin as she pulled away and went to fetch her purse.</p><p>“Have a lovely, <em>quiet</em> evening, my friend!”</p><p>Rio flopped back down and waved vaguely in Alice’s direction before the door closed and she was left alone properly for the first time in a day.</p><p>She closed her eyes and thought back to the poolside of their vacation home and smiled to herself as she did.</p><p>But her gentle daydreaming only lasted so long as her mind drifted back to the day she just had and then the day before and then…</p><p>She sat slowly from her prone position and thought about it for only a second before she went to find the little desk in her room.</p><p>Left inexplicably by hotel staff in every corner of the world was a notepad and pen.</p><p>Only this notepad and pen were the fancy kind, the kind that were embossed and had nibs of actual ink.</p><p>Rio snatched the pen up, grateful she’d only had two glasses of wine at lunch so she could think straight as she put pen to paper and wrote out a note to Agatha.</p><p>It took longer than she anticipated and when she was done she had ink on her fingers and a strange nervous buzzing feeling in her stomach.</p><p>But having read it several times after rewriting it even more times, she was happy enough.</p><p>And saying something was better than not saying something.</p><p>And she thought what she’d written was better than nothing:</p><p>
<em>Agatha,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Just a note of thanks for getting me and Alice tickets to your premiere.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Your performance was astounding. And I’m so grateful that we got to experience it surrounded by that energy. I’ll never forget it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And about the photos with Ralph. I’m so sorry it turned into a shadow on your day. It was nothing, less than nothing, and I hate that it looked like anything at all.</em>
</p><p>
<em>You deserved a day that was all about you and I’m sorry that I ruined even a tiny piece of it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Thank you again and enjoy the rest of your time here.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Yours,<br/>
Rio.</em>
</p><p>So she folded it neatly, having blown on the ink for fear it wouldn’t dry, and slipped out into the grand hallway of her expensive hotel to sneak down the the Grace Kelly Suite where she knew Agatha to be.</p><p>Before indulging in the expensive but studio-subsidised room service menu, Rio had changed into a navy sweater and jeans, an outfit not intended to be seen by the waiting press of Cannes.</p><p>But Levi’s and The GAP were dressing up as far as Rio was concerned for the task she’d set out to do as she hesitated outside the door.</p><p>She took out the note and read it through once more, taking a deep breath as she folded it back over and bent down to slip it below the door.</p><p>But just as she had pressed half the note underneath, the door swung open and Rio was met with a pair of loafers staring back at her.</p><p>She groaned internally and slowly raised her gaze up the length of the one person she would rather not be seeing from this angle.</p><p>It felt too like a fantasy she’d once had.</p><p>Although Agatha had been wearing significantly fewer clothes and Rio hadn’t been clutching an apology note in her hand.</p><p>“Oh. Hey.”</p><p>She cleared her throat and straightened quickly, fighting off the blush that threatened to redden her whole face as she avoided eye contact.</p><p>“I, uh, just wanted to deliver this note.”</p><p>She dared to look up then, seeing Agatha’s brows raise and an amused smile tug at the sides of her lips.</p><p>“A note? How very old school of you.”</p><p>“I just,” Rio rolled her eyes, more at herself than Agatha and raised a hand to run through her hair, “I wanted to apologise for yesterday. And to thank you for… for getting us into the premiere.”</p><p>Agatha remained silent and Rio saw her purse her lips a little, appraising her for a second before she made a move and snatched the note hanging limply from her fingers.</p><p>“Ah! Hey!”</p><p>But Agatha had moved away before Rio got a chance to snatch it back and her face had gone beetroot red at the idea that Agatha was going to read it infront of her.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t, not yet. Wait until…”</p><p>Rio had taken two steps into the suite behind Agatha who had turned her back and was reading the little note.</p><p>Rio huffed loudly, making sure Agatha knew this was <em>not</em> what she’d had in mind when she’d written the note.</p><p>But she couldn’t do much other than tackle Agatha to steal it back and that wasn’t exactly an option.</p><p>“I… I didn’t think you’d be in, so,” she offered in a lame attempt to claw back some dignity as Agatha turned back around to her and stared at her with a look of soft surprise.</p><p>Rio became aware suddenly that they were both just standing in the middle of the open plan living space that Agatha had previously inhabited with her husband and now lived in alone.</p><p>She swallowed thickly and watched as blue eyes dropped to her throat which did nothing to help her blush.</p><p>“You didn’t need to write me a note,” Agatha said in a voice that took Rio off guard.</p><p>It was soft. Far from the teasing tone she’d expected.</p><p>“I mean,” Rio said with a shrug, feeling her heart rate slow now she knew Agatha at least wouldn’t laugh in her face, “you didn’t need to get us tickets. And… I <em>am</em> sorry about the Ralph thing. It really wasn’t anything and I didn’t want you to think I was trying to make it something.”</p><p>Blue eyes dropped back down to the note in her hands and Rio cleared her throat softly, unsure what to say next.</p><p>“I hope he didn’t leave because of me.”</p><p>Agatha looked back up then and Rio bit her lip where Agatha shook her head and began folding Rio’s note back up absently in her hands.</p><p>“No. He doesn’t really enjoy this anyway so I just told him to go home early. Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, aware that Agatha was now slipping her note into her back pocket and she was watching Rio carefully.</p><p>“But Jen said he just touched your hand. Did he…?”</p><p>“No,” Rio clarified quickly, taking a step closer to Agatha without knowing why.</p><p>“He barely touched my hand even. It was just as I was leaving.”</p><p>But Agatha had moved on from the subject of Ralph as her eyes had fallen to Rio’s hands where she’d stepped forwards and she reached suddenly to take up her right hand, looking at the mess Rio had made with the ink earlier.</p><p>“Let me guess… not used to a fountain pen?”</p><p>Rio huffed but fought against the feeling of electricity when the pad of Agatha’s thumb brushed the pad of her forefinger and she felt a little faint as Agatha raised her gaze up to meet her own.</p><p>“It’s not as easy as it looks.”</p><p>“Then I appreciate the effort.”</p><p>Rio smiled in amusement, seeing the twitch in Agatha’s lips as she dropped her hand again.</p><p>“I would have bought you flowers but I assumed you already had too many of those after the premiere.”</p><p>“An excuse if ever I’ve heard one.”</p><p>Rio gaped at Agatha as she turned from her to take up her seat back on the couch and she gestured to the room around her, pointing out the various bouquets of flowers that littered the space.</p><p>She made a mental note to ask Alice why <em>she</em> hadn’t received any flowers.</p><p>“Have you see all of these?!”</p><p>“Another one wouldn’t hurt,” Agatha said with a shrug as she settled back and picked up her wine glass.</p><p>Rio moved closer to the edge of the couch and placed a hand on the back of it, watching Agatha look up at her innocently as she sipped her wine.</p><p>“And here I thought you appreciated my effort.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and then motioned to the couch, “Wine?”</p><p>“I…,” Rio’s smile faltered a little as she considered the offer.</p><p>On the one hand all she wanted to do was drink wine and talk to Agatha, on the other, she felt like that may lead to dangerous territory.</p><p>“I shouldn’t.”</p><p>“Suit yourself,” Agatha said with a small smile, as if she knew why Rio might be refusing her.</p><p>But Rio felt safer still standing, as if the couch between them were enough to absolve her of her crush.</p><p>They stayed silently looking at the other for a few seconds, Rio plucking at the couch distractedly as she took all that was Agatha Harkness in.</p><p>She looked relaxed and Rio realised that it was the first time she’d seen her in her own space - albeit her own space in a rented suite in a hotel - her hair was wild and verging on messy, her face makeup free, and her clothes much more casual than she’d seen her before.</p><p>It was intoxicating.</p><p>The softness of a woman so untouchable, so out of this world famous.</p><p>“I should go,” Rio said eventually, the silence hanging like a heavy blanket between them both.</p><p>She turned to leave and stopped only when she heard Agatha’s voice behind her, louder than it had been before.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio paused and then turned on the spot, a perfect pirouette for a woman who had spent her childhood on the basketball court rather than in the dance studio.</p><p>“You were mesmerising up there today. Really. I couldn’t keep my eyes off of you.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath and felt it settle uncomfortably in her throat, as if her body refused to take it in properly when Agatha’s words had sucked all the oxygen out of the room.</p><p>“Thank you,” she managed to say, unsure what else she <em>could</em> say.</p><p>Agatha just looked across at her, one leg tucked below her, her wine glass held balanced on her knee. Rio’s fingers twitched at her sides and then she turned to leave, favouring what she could have said rather than ruining the compliment with something unworthy of it.</p><p>She stepped from Agatha’s suite as quickly as possibly, practically running back down the hall to get to her own.</p><p>And once inside the safety of her suite, she exhaled the breath she’d been holding, and rested back against the closed door, trying to shake the adrenaline that caused her heart to race in her chest.</p><p>It felt cruel that Agatha had such an impact on her.</p><p>A punishment from a chaotic universe for what, Rio couldn’t fathom.</p><p>She needed to do something to take her mind off of her. Alcohol was out of the question because now she knew she was alone down the hall she didn’t trust herself to not go and knock on the door when she’d had a few, demand to know why she looked at her the way she did, why she had a memory of Agatha pressed so close in a Chicago bar.</p><p>Movies and tv she couldn’t focus on. They were glaring reminders of their shared industry. And therefore glaring reminders of Agatha, whether she were on the screen or not.</p><p>She marched through to her bedroom, deciding a couple melatonin would help to calm her without sending her into outer space.</p><p>It was as she picked up the little tub of pills from the desk that she spotted the remainder of the Hotel-provided paper. And she was suddenly inspired.</p><p>It was cheesy, maybe.</p><p>Stupid, definitely.</p><p>But just doing it didn’t mean she’d give her it.</p><p>And it would be a good distraction from her racing heart and mind for a least a few minutes before she forced herself to sleep.</p><p>She set up her phone against the mirror on the desk and settled herself in the seat, flicking through until she found an easy enough video to follow entitled: ‘Easy Origami Rose’.</p><p>It took a few attempts and therefore longer than a few minutes but eventually Rio was satisfied with her output and in the palm of her hand she now held the flower she should have given Agatha in the first place. Or at least, a small, paper version of one.</p><p>The hotel paper was a pale blue and therefore the rose was too, and Rio thought it was cute and maybe, maybe Agatha would appreciate the effort, just like she had with the note.</p><p>She knew Agatha could laugh in her face when she handed it over but something told her she might not. And that tiny slither of hope was what Rio focused on after popping her melatonin and clambering into bed for a necessary sleep.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, unimpressed by the soft weight of the body lying across her and shouting directly into her ear.</p><p>“Wake up!”</p><p>Rio huffed out a heavy breath, scowling into the pillow and wriggling a little to dislodge Alice. It didn’t work.</p><p>“Get. Off.”</p><p>“Don’t you want to hear about my date?”</p><p>Rio groaned as Alice eventually rolled off of her and she attempted to pull the duvet over her head, trying to hide from the light.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>Rio gave in, knowing she was on a lose lose anyway.</p><p>“Fine. Fine.” She flopped back over and squinted up at Alice who was beaming down at her.</p><p>“You look like shit.”</p><p>“Good morning to you too.”</p><p>“I got in at three,” Alice said with a sly smile that made Rio perk up a little and slowly shuffle into a sitting position at the top of the bed.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“We just talked all night. She invited me back to her room and-…”</p><p>“Alice you dirty dog,” Rio laughed and shoved at her friend’s shoulder roughly.</p><p>“No, no!” Alice laughed with her friend and shoved her right back, “We just talked. Nothing more. Maybe a little kissing but… nothing below the belt.”</p><p>“What about the shirt?”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes and began to shuffle from the bed as Rio guffawed and reached to pull her back to her but missed by centimetres.</p><p>“Wait! Wait! Details!”</p><p>“No, I’m a lady. And so is Jen so I will not fuel your dirty little mind with tawdry details.”</p><p>Rio laughed harder at this and eventually threw herself from the bed and onto Alice, kissing her cheek in earnest and forcing a laugh from the smaller woman.</p><p>“I,” kiss, “am,” kiss, “so,” kiss, “happy,” kiss, “for,” kiss, “you.”</p><p>Alice eventually managed to wriggle from Rio’s clutches and made to leave the room laughing when she spotted the little rose garden sprouting on Rio’s desk.</p><p>“What the fuck?”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said flatly, seeing where Alice’s gaze had fallen, “yeah, I… got bored.”</p><p>Alice raised her brows and shot Rio a look of surprise, “We need to get you a girlfriend. Better things you can do with those fingers.”</p><p>And before Rio could react, Alice disappeared from the room and closed the door behind her, “I thought you were a lady!”</p><p>“Get ready! You have ten minutes!” Alice shouted right back.</p><p>Rio huffed and shot her late night gardening efforts one last look before she disappeared into the bathroom to shower.</p><p>There was just one more day left of torture before she would be lounging by the pool, free of the pressures of looking and being perfect all the time, free of needing to be anything for anyone.</p><p>All she had to do today was smile and get through.</p><p>And, she decided as she stepped from the shower, she had plenty of time to decide whether or not she’d give her handmade flower to Agatha.</p><p>She’d just take it with her today and if she happened to see her then… maybe she would.</p><p>Once she had changed into something unflattering and that would drive Alice crazy because it wasn’t “good for the gram”, she swiped the best of the flowers and went to sit in her usual seat for the glam squad to work their magic.</p><p>This morning she felt considerably lighter than the previous two mornings.</p><p>The movie had gone down well.</p><p>The press had all gone smoothly.</p><p>Alice was happy with her performance (the slight glitch with Ralph now forgotten).</p><p>And Agatha Harkness thought she was mesmerising.</p><p>As she toyed with the little rose in her now ink-free fingers she could enjoy the glamour of it all again; the soft touches of the people around her drying and fluffing her hair, the brushes against her skin making her look dewy in the morning light, and the woman now touching up her manicure to match the white dress she had for the day.</p><p>Even better, she had a two day vacation to focus on after a short day of more press.</p><p>“Um, Rio?”</p><p>Rio started a little from where she’d been staring out at the blue skies above, her free hand still toying with the matching flower she held.</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“I…,” Alice stepped into her line of vision and the look on her face made Rio sit up straighter, pulling away from the hands that preened her.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Jen’s just text.”</p><p>Rio glanced down at the phone in Alice’s hands and then her gaze flickered up again and she held her breath as she dropped her rose in her lap and reached for Alice.</p><p>“I might have invited them.”</p><p>Rio’s hand made contact with Alice’s wrist and she stared at her as if she’d just spoken Greek to her.</p><p>“Invited who?”</p><p>“Jen and Agatha.”</p><p>“Invited them where?”</p><p>Alice looked up slowly and met Rio’s gaze for the first time since she’d interrupted the glam squad around them and with a sinking feeling Rio suddenly realised what Alice meant.</p><p>“No. No. Absolutely not.”</p><p>“It’s just that… well Jen said she’s changed their flights.”</p><p>“<em>Alice</em>.”</p><p>“I… don’t even know what to say. I was a little drunk I…”</p><p>But the hairstylist was moving close again to sort Rio’s hair and so Alice was jostled away as the others moved back, mumbling apologies about the time they had left.</p><p>Rio looked away from her friend, unable to comprehend a world where she’d opened up their sneaky little trip away to two people she barely knew.</p><p>Alice knew she needed to give Rio space and she went to take a seat on the couch behind them. And Rio, Rio was now spinning the rose in her palm as if she span it fast enough it might rewind time and stop Alice from inviting her crush to their one precious vacation.</p><p>But time kept moving as it usually does and Rio was faced with changing into her little white dress with a guilt-ridden Alice in the corner of her room, moving close only when Rio needed held with the zipper.</p><p>“It has two rooms,” Rio said sharply, every detail of this trip now spinning round and round in her mind.</p><p>“I’ll be with you, obviously.”</p><p>“They can’t get their own villa?”</p><p>“I… I think Jen wants…”</p><p>“Agatha makes twenty a picture. She can afford-…”</p><p>“Rio, I think… I think she wants to stay with us because…”</p><p>“You’re there,” Rio snapped, feeling only slightly guilty when she saw Alice flinch.</p><p>“Got it.”</p><p>She stormed out of the room, almost crushing the rose she’d spent so long perfecting the night before.</p><p>Alice only followed her silently out to the waiting car and if anyone had been paying attention to Rio Vidal and her manager over the past three days they’d have noticed this stark change in behaviour.</p><p>They were usually side by side, or arm in arm, either talking or laughing, or sometimes whispering.</p><p>Never was there a foot between them. Never were they silent.</p><p>But when they got in the car Alice spoke again, and this time Rio listened.</p><p>“I’ll tell her she can’t. I’ll say I was drunk and wasn’t thinking and-…”</p><p>But Rio’s rose-free hand flew over to Alice’s knee and she sighed quietly as Alice went silent.</p><p>“It’s fine. I just… I wanted a couple days just to be us and now…”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I don’t know either of them and, god Alice, Agatha Harkness? Seriously? Why does she have to come?”</p><p>And therein lied the issue. Jen was one thing, a snarky interruption on their vacation. But Agatha? Agatha laid out by the pool. Agatha drunk in the sun. Agatha close by.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure she could handle it. And even if she could, she’d be a mess the whole trip.</p><p>“I think Jen just wants a friend.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and shook her head as Alice went to take her hand, “Are you sure it’s okay?”</p><p>“I… yeah. Fine. You really like her?”</p><p>“I <em>really</em> like her. And now maybe this means she really likes me too?”</p><p>Rio looked up then and caught Alice’s tentative gaze, and couldn’t help but give in to her. She squeezed her hand and offered her a small smile because she couldn’t offer much more as nervous as she was about this new development.</p><p>“I think it means she does.”</p><p>Alice’s shoulders relaxed a bit then, shrinking down from where they’d been hovering near her ears and she shifted a little to get more comfortable in her seat.</p><p>“They’re not on the same flight at least. They get in a little later than us because of the Ceremony later so we can pick the best room and have some dinner and then…”</p><p>“Then figure out how the hell we’ll get through the next couple days.”</p><p>Alice raised her brows and smiled warmly, “Jen is great. And Agatha is apparently great too. Plus it’ll give you an opportunity to get closer to her. She’d be a really good ally to have and-…”</p><p>“I think we’re close enough.”</p><p>“It wouldn’t hurt, Rio. Just… please try and be as charming as you can be.”</p><p>Rio dropped her gaze to the flower in her hand and began to brush the tips of the petals with her thumb, taking each one in turn.</p><p>“Okay. I’ll be on my best behaviour.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Their reconciliation was cut short when they arrived at another hotel were more press interviews were happening.</p><p>Rio was ushered through the grand lobby and out to a courtyard garden where she was offered orange juice in a champagne flute and asked to wait until they were ready for her.</p><p>At least this way, she got some sun before being locked away for hours on end in a stuffy room with stuffier people asking the same old questions.</p><p>Alice had abandoned her in favour of finding the list of journos soon to be boring her client to death and so Rio hovered by the table draped in white linen and covered in breakfast pastries.</p><p>“Good morning,” came a familiar voice through the greenery, and Rio turned to see Agatha striding towards her looking far more glamorous than she had the night before in a blue and white striped dress and red lipstick.</p><p>“I hear we’re crashing your vacation.”</p><p>“I hear you make twenty a picture and you’re kicking me out of my room to bunk with Jen.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and accepted her orange juice with a smile before turning back to Rio, “Who am I to get in the way of burgeoning romance?”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, catching a glimmer of amusement in Agatha’s blue and she felt the urge to one up her, to throw her off course so she turned her hand palm up and held out the rose she’d made her.</p><p>“For you,” she said simply, watching bright blue eyes fly down to the pale paper flower in her hand. And there, Rio caught Agatha suck in a short and sharp intake of breath, her lips parting a little in shock as Rio waited patiently for her to take it.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move for a second, her eyes still on the little flower. Rio briefly considered moving for her, forcing her into action, but she held her ground and it soon paid off because Agatha had stepped closer and was now just lightly touching the petals of the rose with her forefinger, the way Rio had earlier in the car.</p><p>“I made it. I thought you’d appreciate the effort.”</p><p>This close up, Agatha was no less beautiful. And with her gaze down on the flower, Rio had the opportunity to take her in properly without fear of being caught.</p><p>She’d been made up today to look like she barely had any makeup on at all. A clever trick, Rio had always thought, because usually that meant you were wearing more makeup than an average person wore in a week.</p><p>But Agatha wore it well. Her skin still looked like skin and Rio could see the faint freckles that were scattered sporadically over her nose and cheeks. She could see the slight sea change of colour in her eyes that made them sometimes bright blue and other times strangely green.</p><p>And those eyes were now looking across at her, taking her in the way Rio had just done with Agatha. Though, Agatha was bolder with it because where Rio had the privacy of Agatha’s gaze being away from her, Rio was looking directly at Agatha as she did it.</p><p>“You made it for me?”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“Along with a few others but… this was my best one.”</p><p>She held her hand up a little higher, holding it so Agatha would take it.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped down to it again and she seemed hesitant at first and then picked it up and held it in her own hand and Rio felt a spark of pride that her creation now sat cradled in Agatha Harkness’s hand like it were something precious.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have.”</p><p>“I wanted to.”</p><p>Rio met Agatha’s gaze again and they both smiled, Rio losing herself for a moment as she stared across at Agatha and wondered what it might be like to be this close to her all the time.</p><p>But Agatha was moving and Rio was powerless to stop it - not that she would have if she had the choice.</p><p>Agatha’s hand holding the flower had curled around it, moving down to rest on Rio’s hip as she pressed a soft kiss to Rio’s left cheek and then moved around to deliver the same to her right.</p><p>She’d received multiple kisses just like this one since arriving in France but this was the first time she felt aflame because of it.</p><p>And Agatha’s hand still at her hip wasn’t helping.</p><p>“Merci,” Agatha whispered softly, her face still close enough that Rio could make out the green in her blue eyes again, her hand still lightly against her hip.</p><p>But the whispered French had unwittingly brought back memories of Ralph speaking the word to her two days ago, his cloying, clanging American twang turning it into something embarrassing where Agatha had curled her lips around it, softening her accent until it was something else entirely.</p><p>Rio wondered how this goddess was married to that nothing of a man.</p><p>A good husband only because he was handsome and rich and not because he valued his wife’s talent and achievements, or even remained loyal to her.</p><p>And certainly not because he spent time to create a flower for her with his own two hands.</p><p>But she couldn’t think like that. Not with Agatha now coming away with her and Alice.</p><p>She had to distance the part of her that wanted to kiss Agatha from the part of her that wanted to survive the next two days without going mad.</p><p>There was a noise behind them and they both turned to see Alice beaming across at them. Agatha’s hand slipped away from Rio’s hip and Rio felt like she could breathe again.</p><p>“Agatha! Hi! So glad you could make it to Italy!”</p><p>Rio shot her a look over Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“Rio, they’re ready for you.”</p><p>Rio nodded and in lieu of saying goodbye to Agatha in the way she’d just thanked her she turned around and reached for a croissant, taking it with her as she brushed past Agatha.</p><p>Saying ‘goodbye’ or ‘see you later’ felt too formal so she simply smiled over her shoulder at Agatha and entered back into the main part of the hotel.</p><p>The interviews flew by because Rio wasn’t really thinking about them.</p><p>She was thinking about the way Agatha had looked at her, the way she’d remained close, how she’d held her when there was no need.</p><p>Maybe she was delusional, she didn’t really care, because the idea that Agatha Harkness might find her even slightly appealing, attractive, charming, made her want to whoop in delight.</p><p>When the last journalist left the stuffy little room and Alice and Rio were left alone with the crew Alice finally asked the question she’d been sitting on all day: “Why’re you so happy? What happened?”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and stood from her seat, stretching briefly before she marched on over and like a kid in love, she grinned as she kissed her best friend’s forehead.</p><p>“Just excited for Italy.”</p><p>Alice frowned her suspicions up at her friend but said nothing and instead began to gather their things.</p><p>They both thanked the crew and left to head back to the hotel.</p><p>Rio’s good mood lasted all the way to Italy.</p><p>Even when Alice was going over and over their schedule for when they got back to the states. Even when Alice was worrying out loud about whether or not a weekend away with Jen so early in their tentative relationship would make or break them. Even when they landed and had to travel from Naples to Positano along the high, winding coastal roads of the Amalfi Coast.</p><p>But her good mood paid off because the villa looked even better in real life.</p><p>Situated above on the hillside above the colourful bay, the sand-coloured villa was as impressive on the outside as it was inside.</p><p>The open-plan living kitchen area was spacious and Alice soon discovered that her planning ahead had paid dividends: the wine fridge was stocked and the cupboards, pantry, and fridge were full of fresh local ingredients and snacks.</p><p>But Rio was more interested in the outside space.</p><p>The pool was large and overlooked the hillside with a glass barrier a foot from the edge of the clear blue water, protecting the villa from the cliff edge.</p><p>There was a little dining area to the side and a handful of sun beds dotted around the space.</p><p>But the view.</p><p>The view was unreal.</p><p>Rio lost herself scanning the hillside and looking down over the bay until Alice appeared at her side and gasped quietly.</p><p>“Holy shit. I love that you’re rich now.”</p><p>Rio just laughed and stole Alice back inside, so they could toast to their mutual success that allowed for this kind of villa to be available to them.</p><p>“Okay okay,” Alice said after half a glass of wine on the terrace.</p><p>“But we have to pick a room.”</p><p>“The best one,” Rio said with narrowed eyes at her friend. “You promised we’d get the best one.”</p><p>“Well, seeing as we’re both trying to impress our guests…”</p><p>“Alice, no. Come on. This is <em>our</em> vacation.”</p><p>Alice chewed on her lip and remained silent for a while before she finally said, “Think of how many doors would open if you got Agatha on side.”</p><p>Rio threw her head back, unwilling to share her deep, dark, embarrassing belief that Agatha might just have a little thing for her.</p><p>She was sure she had her as much on side as she ever could.</p><p>“I haven’t had a day off in months.”</p><p>“I know but…”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio said suddenly, throwing her hands out, “Whatever. Let them have the best one. I don’t want to fight anymore.”</p><p>They remained silent for a little while and Rio could feel Alice’s eyes on her.</p><p>But she didn’t cave.</p><p>“I think she’s incredible.”</p><p>Rio looked across at Alice and smiled, “I know you do.”</p><p>“And she loves Agatha.”</p><p>Rio’s smile faded a little and she turned away.</p><p>“So being friends with her will not only help <em>you</em> but it would also help me.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly, “We’re friendly, Alice. Don’t try to push anything. We’re… feeling each other out. She’s complex.”</p><p>“But you’re not.”</p><p>Rio grinned and took a sip of wine, “Are you calling me shallow?”</p><p>“More like… straight forward. A little arrogant. Easily amused.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and wondered how Alice would react to her telling her she was in the midst of a near zen-like high because Agatha had accepted a paper flower from her several hours ago and had kissed her cheek.</p><p>“Sure, let’s go with that.”</p><p>It took them finishing the bottle of wine for them to actually head up the stairs with their bags and claim the less incredible of the rooms. Which was hard. Because both were incredible.</p><p>But Alice decided the one with the blue walls just beat the one with the pink because it had a free-standing bath in the en suite.</p><p>“Jen might like that.”</p><p>Rio had just rolled her eyes, annoyed that she had to lug her bags back across the hall to the other room.</p><p>Once their bags were offloaded and Rio made an acceptable but not astounding pasta dish, they retired to the couch where Alice forced Rio to stay until their guests arrived.</p><p>Rio’s earlier high at the prospect of her straight peer potentially having less than straight thoughts about her had disappeared. Perhaps it was the exhaustion creeping in, perhaps it was the wine she’d consumed, or maybe the bowl and a half of pasta puttanesca, but she suddenly didn’t feel so optimistic about Agatha’s arrival.</p><p>But Rio Vidal fell asleep on the couch, curled around a cushion and was woken up around two in the morning by Alice shouting her name and running to the door.</p><p>“They’re here?” She asked groggily, fighting the urge to just roll back over and go to sleep.</p><p>But Jen’s voice carried through the space and Rio groaned quietly as she sat up and dug the heels of her hands into her eyes.</p><p>Maybe the second bottle of wine had been a bad idea.</p><p>“This place is gorgeous!”</p><p>Rio groaned again and forced herself to stand up, running her hand through her hair at the last minute to try to fix what was already broken.</p><p>“God it’s-… Jesus, Rio. Make an effort, much?”</p><p>Rio blinked at the sudden insult and glanced down at herself before she moved around the couch towards the waiting women.</p><p>Two smiling at her, one with an amused smirk.</p><p>“A pleasure to have you here with us on <em>our</em> vacation, Jen.”</p><p>Alice jabbed Rio’s side and Rio only just managed to squirm away. She felt Agatha’s eyes on her as she did so.</p><p>“Alice invited us,” Jen said with a grin that had softened somewhat and Rio glanced at Alice to see her looking suddenly shy.</p><p>“Well we’re pleased to have you.”</p><p>“And here I thought you were a <em>good</em> actress,” Jen said with a smirk just as Rio’s gaze moved to Agatha as she strode towards the bifold glass doors to take in the view outside.</p><p>“Very funny.”</p><p>“Now, Agatha here just won the <em>Palme D’Or</em>.”</p><p>Rio was still looking at Agatha and watched as she turned from where she stood by the glass doors to look at them with raised brows, her gaze lingering on Rio for a second, “The film won. Not me.”</p><p>“Same thing.”</p><p>“Oscar’s ours, baby,” Jen said in a softer tone and Rio didn’t have to look around to know that she was now talking only to Alice.</p><p>Rio scoffed softly but decided she was too tired to either charm or scorn so she disappeared to get a glass of water.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice shouted after her, “Could you get some wine?”</p><p>Rio could only hum a response and grabbed two more glasses and a fresh bottle before she turned back towards the living area of the space and poured three glasses, avoiding her own.</p><p>“You’re not staying?”</p><p>“I would but I’m exhausted.”</p><p>“Refusing to drink wine with me two nights in a row, Vidal? I’ll start to get offended.”</p><p>Tried brown eyes flickered across to teasing blue ones and Rio bit the inside of her cheek.</p><p>“Third time’s the charm. Perhaps you’ll get lucky tomorrow.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t that be a thing.”</p><p>Agatha moved forwards to pick up her glass and they maintained eye contact, Rio feeling a little stupefied by the obvious flirting and only Alice rocked her from her trance.</p><p>“We’ll go to the beach tomorrow.”</p><p>But as Rio looked up at her friend she saw that she was already back engrossed in Jen, her face lit up with the prospect of two days (practically) alone with her.</p><p>On the couch, Agatha was watching Rio, and it took Rio a second to notice but when she looked back down, Agatha had looked away.</p><p>She hesitated for just a second before she turned on her heel and trod the path up to her designated bed for the night.</p>

<p>Rio woke to a pillow to her face and yelped as she sat bolt upright, cradling the offending weapon to her.</p><p>“Alice!”</p><p>“Get up! We only have two days here. I want to make the most of it. And you need to tell me what to wear to look <em>irresistible</em>”

</p><p>Rio huffed and rolled over, “I pay your wages, you know.”</p><p>“Yes, I know. Pay me more, bitch.”</p><p>Rio laughed as Alice jumped onto the bed behind her and began to shake her shoulders playfully, attempting to annoy her out of bed. </p><p>“Get off! Get off!”</p><p>Rio shuffled away and flopped onto her back, scowling at a grinning Alice. </p><p>“You’re too giddy. I don’t like this Alice. What happened to my brooding, charmingly grumpy friend?”</p><p>“She’s in looooove,” Alice sang out and laughed as she threw herself from the bed and went to fetch her outfit options for the day. </p><p>“Alice,” Rio said steadily, sitting slowly to look at across at her with what she hoped was a stern expression but the twitch to the right of her lips gave her away a little.</p><p>“Don’t go all goo-goo ga-ga on me. I can’t handle it.”

</p><p>“Shut up. Just help me pick.”</p><p>“I can’t believe this is what my vacation has turned into.”</p><p>Alice looked guilty suddenly and her smile faded from her face, “I know. I’m sorry. You know I didn’t-…”

</p><p>“It’s fine.” </p><p>Rio sighed heavily and ungracefully hauled herself from the bed, yawning as she arrived at Alice’s side and surveyed the options laid out before her. </p><p>“Well, I mean…” she held up a teeny tiny bikini top and held it against her own chest, “Who could resist?”</p><p>“Stop that,” Alice laughed and grabbed it back, “I’d wear a shirt over it.”</p><p>“No way.” Rio reached to take it back and grinned down at it, “This’ll give her a heart attack.”</p><p>“I don’t want a heart attack. I want at least some above the bikini action before we have to head back to our real lives.”</p><p>“Alice, this will get you more than that. I promise you.”</p><p>Alice huffed but Rio could see the smirk threatening her best friend’s features, “red one it is.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio announced as she made her way to the adjoining bathroom, yawning again and stretching her arms up in the air to release any tension from the previous night. “I’ll be down in ten. Don’t leave without me.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t dream of it.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at the sarcastic drawl of her giddy friend and disappeared to shower. </p><p>Beneath the heavy waterfall, Rio took slow and steady breaths, taking the time to convince her mind and body that today would be easy. She needed to believe it because she’d not felt this nervous around another human being since middle school.</p><p>Agatha’s presence was a constant pull towards the version of Rio that was incredibly uncool and incredibly downbad for the cheerleader who once smiled at her in the hallway but otherwise barely acknowledged her presence. </p><p>But she had to get through it, had to find a way to be friendly, for the sake of her career, and for the sake of Alice’s burgeoning relationship with Jen. </p><p>So she got out, dried herself, and slipped into a black bikini, denim short shorts, and a Hawaiian overshirt that Alice hated but that Rio loved. </p><p>She barely glanced in the mirror, knowing makeup would be the wrong choice for a day by the beach and her hair would dry naturally anyway. </p><p>Plus she had no one to impress. </p><p>Technically.</p><p>Rio was the last one down to the little group and smiled at the expectant faces of the three people waiting for her. </p><p>“Lookin’ good, Vidal,” Alice shot at her with a wink, “but you’d look better if you took that shirt off.”</p><p>Rio laughed and muttered, “Heard that one before.” 

</p><p>“Is that… cowboys?” Jen asked with a frown, tilting her head to get a proper look at the print of Rio’s shirt.</p><p>“You’re darn right it is.”</p><p>“Oh god,” Alice groaned out, “don’t get her started.”</p><p>“What? I’m kidding! That isn’t very rootin’ tootin’ of you, Alice.”</p><p>A soft noise behind her made Rio turn and she caught Agatha’s eye, seeing her smile a little in amusement at her, her gaze dropping briefly to the cowboys flying their lassos over Rio’s shirt.</p><p>“Cute.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this but said nothing, ignoring the lurch in her stomach as it happened.</p><p>But Alice was desperate to get them to the beach, desperate to show off for Jen, and Rio didn’t protest as she made a fuss about all grabbing their stuff to leave.</p><p>Rio complained only when Alice refused to let her make a coffee first but as they stepped into the sun, she found Agatha pressing a mug into her hand, “Here. Just made it. Already had one.”</p><p>Unsure whether this was just a kind gesture or a dig at Rio being the last up, Rio accepted it all the same, and happily drank Agatha’s coffee all the way down to the beach.</p><p>Alice had done her research and had picked the smaller of the beaches in the area, Fornillo Spiaggia, so that they’d hopefully be less bothered by tourists and fans.</p><p>Rio had brought with her a trusty, dusty blue cap to be as incognito as possible and she noticed that Agatha had been thinking along the same lines but had a woven hat with a floppy wide brim instead.</p><p>Rio was a little luckier, she supposed, she could potentially be mistaken for any old Italian beachgoer, but Agatha was clearly a movie star.</p><p>On the way down to the sand, Alice broached the subject of shared photos and Agatha politely but firmly declined, offering no reasoning behind her refusal but allowing her “no” to speak for itself.</p><p>Rio ought to have been offended by this but she couldn’t find it in herself to care much. Neither Agatha nor Jen were supposed to be on this vacation anyway, so what did she care if there was photographic evidence they were. “Looks good for the brand,” Alice muttered in annoyance to her as they set themselves up.</p><p>Jen insisted that Agatha be on the inside of the little group of four, for fear she’d be spotted too easily if on the outside.</p><p>This, Agatha protested too, but her “no” this time was ignored.</p><p>And although Rio was disgruntled that Agatha would be beside her all day, she couldn’t help but be amused by the sight of Agatha not getting her own way with Jen. Their relationship felt a lot like hers and Alice’s. Which meant that Agatha Harkness might just be human after all.</p><p>Pretending to not notice the quiet discussion beside her as it was ongoing, Rio unfurled her towel and stripped down to her bikini, throwing her shorts and shirt over the end of her bed.</p><p>She fished out the sun lotion from her bag and was just about to apply some to her legs when she heard a voice beside her ask: “Can I have that after you?”</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha, now sitting on her own sunbed with her hat still on her head and an expectant look on her face.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Well,” Rio said slowly, doing her best not to look at the expanse of pale skin on offer to her with Agatha in a mauve bikini. “It’s just…” but there was no use, she had to look, but only because it was relevant to the conversation.</p><p>She glanced down and spotted a smattering of freckles across Agatha’s chest, unwilling to look any further, she looked back up. “You’ll burn.”</p><p>“That’s why I want the lotion,” Agatha said, raising her brows and straightening her back a little, which only made it harder for Rio to maintain eye contact.</p><p>“No, I mean, I’ve SPF 15. You’ll surely need stronger.”</p><p>A look of incredulity flashed across Agatha’s face and she laughed a little, “So you won’t share it which will mean I’ll burn anyway?”</p><p>“That isn’t what I meant. I just meant…” she looked around and saw Alice applying lotion to Jen’s back and had to fight the grin from her face, knowing how thrilled Alice would be about this honour.</p><p>“Maybe ask Jen and Alice.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and turned to do just that but quickly turned back around to Rio and shook her head, holding her hand out to her, “They’re busy. Gimme.”</p><p>Rio huffed and handed the lotion across, and only in doing so did she realise she was yet to put any on herself.</p><p>She threw herself back down on the bed and waited impatiently for Agatha to be done, refusing to look around at what was surely to be an incredible sight of Agatha rubbing lotion all over her body.</p><p><em>Pervert</em>, she thought idly to herself.</p><p>A light tap on her shoulder a few minutes later told her that Agatha was done with her sun cream and Rio lifted to her elbows to take it from her, frowning a little as she did.</p><p>She lifted her glasses and a slow smile spread over her face as Agatha looked at her quizzically, “What is it?”</p><p>“You’ve got a little…” Rio motioned near her own nose and smiled wider when Agatha missed it entirely and somehow rubbed more cream across the bridge of her nose.</p><p>“Here,” Rio offered as she swung her legs over the side of the bed and reached to gently wipe the lotion from Agatha’s nose. She realised only when she pulled her hand away that she’d been holding her breath as she did this, and she flushed slightly at the realisation.</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha muttered quietly, her own cheeks slightly flushed and her eyes darting about Rio’s face.</p><p>They watched each other for a second and Rio felt the familiar butterflies in her stomach as she met Agatha’s gaze but she soon turned away and busied herself with the bottle so she didn’t have to look at Agatha again.</p><p>By the time she was done, she lay back out and sighed as she stretched an arm above her on the sun bed, allowing the heat of the day to soothe her of the knowledge that right beside her was Agatha Harkness, lying in a similar position, in a bikini that Rio had decided she couldn’t look at again for fear she’d combust.</p><p>“Rio,” the voice came close to her ear and Rio frowned a little, her whole body hot and uncomfortable in the midday sun, but Alice was persistent, and shook Rio’s shoulder, “you’ll want to wake up for this. Jet skis. Come on.”</p><p>Rio blinked her way awake, frowning into the brightness even with her sunglasses and cap on.</p><p>She first noticed Alice crouched beside her and then spotted Jen and Agatha a little way down the beach by the shed where the water sports equipment could be rented.</p><p>“How long was I asleep?”</p><p>“Do me a solid,” Alice said urgently, “share one with Agatha. I want to share with Jen and if you-…”</p><p>“No. Alice. No. That would be <em>insane</em>.”</p><p>Alice whined a little and took Rio’s hand when she sat up properly and swung her legs over the edge.</p><p>“Just ask Jen if she’d share.”</p><p>“No I don’t want to seem too keen.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio laughed, “Like inviting her on vacation? And me asking Agatha to share isn’t going to look too keen?”</p><p>“You’re friends, sorta, there’s nothing romantic there, it’s different.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and turned around to look over at the two by the shed, seeing Jen wave them over. Agatha was at least wearing a large linen shirt now, her long hair loose now she didn’t have her hat on and the large sunglasses covering her blue eyes.</p><p>Maybe she could do it.</p><p>Maybe she could just ignore the closeness and focus on the driving.</p><p>“Fine,” Rio said stiffly, turning back to Alice, “Don’t ask me for anything else this trip, okay?”</p><p>Alice beamed up at her from where she was resting against the back of her ankles and kissed the back of Rio’s hand. “Yes. Thank you. I owe you one.”</p><p>“You owe me more than one.”</p><p>Rio grabbed her shirt with the cowboys, shoving it on unhappily as they marched their way over to Agatha and Jen.</p><p>Alice nudged Rio’s arm as they got close and Rio rolled her eyes but glanced Agatha’s way and swallowing her pride she said: “Want to ride with me? More fun when there’s two.”</p><p>She couldn’t see her eyes beneath her large shades but Agatha’s brows rose up and she looked startled for a second before she said: “That so? Fine. I’ve never been on one before anyway so you can show me how it’s done, cowboy.”</p><p>Rio hadn’t expected the nickname. She hadn’t expected to be so affected by it either.</p><p>She poked her tongue into the inside of her cheek and heard a sudden ringing in her ears. How Agatha was able to do this to her she had no idea. But she stepped forwards anyway and approached the Italian man waiting for who was going to rent what.</p><p>She explained they’d be taking two and he only nodded, pointing briefly to a safety notice on the side that had stick men exhibiting some strange behaviours at sea: drinking from a wine bottle, riding backwards, and waving his arms in the air.</p><p>Rio studied this for a second and once sure she wouldn’t be doing any of those things she nodded her assent.</p><p>“No glasses,” he said suddenly and Rio thought it was weird they couldn’t wear their sunglasses but at no point had he said anything about them all being half dressed.</p><p>She raised a brow but nodded and passed him her glasses, turning to the others to make sure they did the same.</p><p>Jen was the only one who had a problem with this and huffed as she removed her Chanels and handed them over.</p><p>But it was when he turned to Agatha that Rio suddenly had the problem.</p><p>She stood between them so watched almost in slow motion as the man lecherously looked her up and down, his greedy eyes taking in every inch of skin on offer to him and his tongue coming out to wet his lips.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and though the man didn’t notice or look up she saw that Agatha did.</p><p>She turned away quickly and tried to ignore the strange feeling of anger that had bubbled in her chest. Surely it was just that a man was ogling a woman. Nothing more.</p><p>But soon she was being handed a thin life jacket, bundled in a u-shape that hung upside down over her neck.</p><p>It didn’t look very effective but Rio was confident enough that she wouldn’t be the cause of either herself or Agatha Harkness dying today.</p><p>They followed the man down to the shore and waded in a few steps and watched a very brief and not very detailed instruction as to how to start and stop the skis.</p><p>Rio was losing patience with this man, but tried not to let it show even as her jaw flexed and when he was done with his demonstration she walked right past him and threw her leg over the seat, situating herself as she waited for Agatha.</p><p>“Not a fan?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Rio was checking the turn key operation and adjusting herself in the seat to make sure she was comfortable, not looking at Agatha who now stood beside her, watching curiously.</p><p>“You look furious, honey.”</p><p>Rio froze briefly and turned to look at Agatha, momentarily taken aback by the sight of her standing in water up to her knees, wearing the life jacket around her neck.</p><p>It was infuriating that she looked good in it.</p><p>“It’s nothing,” she huffed quietly, turning back to the ski to make sure she knew where everything was before they went out on the open water.</p><p>She felt Agatha clamber on behind her, and was grateful that she wasn’t pressed close.</p><p>“You ready?” She asked after thirty more seconds, only slightly more cautious of just heading off than Alice was who had just skated off beside them.</p><p>“When you are,” Agatha responded, and Rio raised her brows when she found her elbows suddenly being held.</p><p>She glanced down to her right and then looked over her shoulder at Agatha curiously, “You’ll have to hold on properly.” She reached her left hand back and found the small fabric handle just behind her, “Here.”</p><p>She watched as Agatha glanced at it, and then looked back up, “That? That doesn’t look…” but then something happened and Agatha seemed to change her mind and she straightened her back a little, tossing her hair behind her back as she reached for the little handle with both hands.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and turned back around, and in a quick one-two motion, they were off.</p><p>Rio made for where Alice had gone to and when they were out as far as the deepest swimmers she kicked the throttle in properly and the little jet ski flew over the waves.</p><p>Rio laughed with her adrenaline rush and whooped until she heard a voice over the din of the engine and the rush of the wind.</p><p>“Rio! Rio!”</p><p>Rio turned her head slightly when she heard it, and without hesitation she slowed the beast of a machine down, turning inwards so they were facing back into the shore and maintaining a steady hand until she cut the engine and they bobbed slowly with the waves.</p><p>“You okay?” She turned and saw that Agatha looked white, her eyes wide.</p><p>“Shit. Sorry. I-…”</p><p>“No, it’s fine. It’s okay.”</p><p>Rio turned as best she could and reached for Agatha’s arm, squeezing it gently, “I’ll slow down.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said quickly, and Rio felt the sting of rejection as she brushed Rio’s hand from her arm, “No I’m fine. I just didn’t know they could go that fast.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and chewed on a lip for a second before she asked: “Would you feel better if you held onto me?”</p><p>Agatha opened and closed her mouth a couple times and then looked down between them at the flimsy handle she had in a death grip, glancing between that and Rio’s shirt.</p><p>She didn’t say anything but she shifted slowly forwards and as soon as she did, Rio realised what a mistake this offer was.</p><p>Agatha was now pressed against her, their bodies totally flush bar the life vest draped around Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Rio felt on fire suddenly, the flames spreading over her in a second, and worsened by the arms that snaked around her waist, and the soft shock of a hand slipping below her shirt to rest against her exposed ribcage.</p><p>When Agatha spoke again she spoke close to Rio’s ear and she had to fight the shiver that threatened her entire body at the feel of her breath so close.</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>Rio wondered why Agatha hadn’t moved her hand when she’d realised it was inside her open shirt but she didn’t, couldn’t, draw attention to it for fear of being caught out.</p><p>So she focused back on the task at hand, and forgot about the woman wrapped so snugly around her.</p><p>The only issue was, when Rio built their speed back up, Agatha held her only tighter, and with so little fabric between them Rio could feel every flex of her muscles, very twitch of her fingers, and every frightened breath against her neck.</p><p>If Rio had felt like she was flying before, it was nothing to now.</p><p>Agatha holding her was the best and worst thing in the world.</p><p>She’d felt safe enough to go fast again only because Agatha hadn’t exclaimed or screamed or told her to stop. And the faster she went, the more Agatha kept close.</p><p>If she stopped Agatha would pull away. She’d drop her hold and Rio would never feel this way again.</p><p>But Alice and Jen were in the distance and they were waving to them to come over.</p><p>They were heading further out to sea now and Rio had to slow down for fear she’d send them both toppling into the deep.</p><p>And if Agatha were scared now, she could only imagine how scared she’d be in the open water.</p><p>So she slowed to a reasonable pace which meant she’d have no problem pulling up beside Alice’s ski and with it she felt Agatha’s hold loosen but she didn’t pull away.</p><p>Just as they arrived parallel to the other two in their party Rio felt Agatha squeeze over her ribs gently, and then her thumb brush over her skin and Rio almost rocketed them off in the wrong direction by accident.</p><p>She could feel every inch of her body like her sensitivity had been dialled up to a hundred.</p><p>Every inch of it that Agatha touched was still on fire and Rio idly wondered if she’d ever feel the same again.</p><p>Maintaining a steady path towards Alice, she briefly glanced over her left shoulder at Agatha and regretted it immediately where their faces were too close and she had to turn sharply to avoid the pull of hypnotic blue eyes.</p><p>Agatha’s hold on her soon fell as they reached the others but she didn’t move back and as Rio pulled up and turned off the engine, Agatha dropped her hands to just before Rio’s thighs, resting her fingertips on the seat.</p><p>They were so close that Rio could feel the warmth of her palms against her inner thighs and she had to fight with herself as she gently lifted Agatha’s hands from this position and placed them on her hips, which felt safer but still not out of the danger zone.</p><p>“I hate this,” Jen said with a frown, her arms still wrapped tightly around a very pleased looking Alice.</p><p>“Are there sharks in the Med?”</p><p>“Oh plenty,” Agatha said with a laugh, “All very keen on publicists.”</p><p>Rio snorted and felt the unmistakeable squeeze of her hip. She glanced back at Agatha and saw she was smiling at her, looking almost as pleased as Alice.</p><p>“What’s this?” Jen asked suddenly, indicating Rio and Agatha who were smiling at each other still, only turning back when she added, “What’s going on?”</p><p>“Can’t stay for long and chat, I’m afraid,” Agatha said suddenly, squeezing both of Rio’s hips and then wrapping her arms back around her. If Rio needed any other indication that Agatha wanted her to drive again, it was that both hands were now beneath her shirt and life vest, holding her bare waist, and Rio would have driven across oceans if it meant she could continue having her hold her there. “We’ll catch you back at the beds.”</p><p>With that, Rio kicked the engine into gear with another one-two, and without giving any warning, they shot off, running parallel to the current and moving down with it until Rio found and calm to hit the gas and jump up the speed.</p><p>In their wake both Jen and Alice watched in shock until Alice shrugged and said, “Rio likes to show off.”</p><p>And Rio did.</p><p>Rio heard the sound of Agatha laughing against her ear and turned a little into it, keeping her eyes on the open sea. “It’s like flying!”</p><p>And Rio began to laugh too, because maybe Agatha felt even a fraction of how she felt then, maybe she could understand just a small bit how her body was reacting to her.</p><p>Or maybe not, and that was fine too, because she could have listened to just her laughing for centuries.</p><p>But Rio had a pretty girl wrapped around her which meant that no ordinary amount of showing off would do.</p><p>She had to push it.</p><p>And so, without warning, she swung them around, and Agatha yelled out in surprise, her arms constricting impossibly so Rio felt like she couldn’t breath but then they were speeding off in the other direction again and Agatha relented.</p><p>Rio took deep gasps of air and guessed that Agatha knew what she’d done because she was rubbing her thumbs gently across her ribs, soothing Rio’s burning lungs as best she could.</p><p>But her soft touches were much worse than getting no oxygen to her lungs.</p><p>Rio felt high with it, and was vaguely concerned she could be caught for driving under the influence: Agatha’s influence.</p><p>When Rio slowed again, unsure how much the little ski could take with two bodies on it and going at max speed for the majority of their run, Agatha’s arms loosened and uncrossed over her body.</p><p>She felt them taking the unnecessary journey of pulling back over her ribs to rest at her sides so her shirt was pulled back below her armpits and her front was totally exposed to the open sea.</p><p>She held her there for longer than she needed to and Rio had to tell herself Agatha was just taking a moment to recover because it felt like she was just enjoying holding her.</p><p>Which wasn’t something a happily married woman would do.</p><p>“That was crazy,” Agatha breathed softly, slowly dropping her hold on Rio to rest her hands down against her hips.</p><p>Rio glanced back at her and had to fight the urge to push her hands away completely, feeling as hot as she did under her touches.</p><p>But Agatha seemed to sense this and pulled her hands away, placing a few inches between them on the seat.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and glanced back again at her, briefly catching sight of blue eyes staring back at her, “You think Jennifer’s in love?”</p><p>“Without a doubt. Jen’s been obsessed since she first saw her.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah. Love at first sight.”</p><p>Rio laughed and ran a hand through her hair, shaking it out loosely where it was was damp from the salt spray, “I didn’t take you for the romantic type.”</p><p>“No? What gave me away?”</p><p>Rio hummed and rested her forearms on the handlebars, staring out at the sea before them, “Your general demeanour and you know… ice queen reputation.”</p><p>She felt a sudden, light jab to her side and squealed a little as she batted a hand that had already retreated. “Hey! I’m sensitive.”</p><p>Agatha snorted behind her and Rio glanced back to see that Agatha had turned her attention to the open body of water too and she looked distant for a second before she asked, “Are you seeing anyone?”</p><p>Despite the innocence of the question it hung heavy in the salt air between them and Rio didn’t know why. She wanted to puff her chest and proclaim that she saw a new girl every night but Agatha wasn’t the right audience for that.</p><p>Though she wanted her to know she was desirable.</p><p>Wanted her to know that if she’d felt like this about any other actress she’d probably have found a way to make it happen for her.</p><p>To get over her crush by getting <em>under</em> her crush. Or on top of her. Whichever way was quickest.</p><p>But she shook those feelings off and instead shrugged a little, deciding honesty was the best policy.</p><p>“No. I haven’t had a girlfriend for a couple years now.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>
<em>My inability to commit, my fear of rejection.</em>
</p><p>She couldn’t give those answers either.</p><p>So Rio shrugged and dropped her gaze to the gentle waves beneath them, choosing another truth instead: “Work takes me all over the place. There aren’t many people who’d put up with so much distance all the time.”</p><p>Agatha was silent for a while and Rio looked over her shoulder at her, feeling the weight of things unsaid but not knowing what they were.</p><p>“And Ralph? How’s he with it all?”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha said noncommittally, shrugging her shoulders and looking down at her hands, “He’s fine.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow and decided to probe a little more. Seemed like both of them were only telling half truths.</p><p>“Was it love at first sight?” Agatha’s eyes snapped up to her own, “With Ralph?”</p><p>Then her gaze dropped again and she shook out her hair, making a vague gesture back to the shoreline, “We should probably head back.”</p><p>The change had been so sudden that if Rio had blinked she’d have missed it.</p><p>Agatha was looking more than distant now.</p><p>She looked on another planet.</p><p>And the strange, tentative rapport they’d built up since that first photoshoot, then had cemented in Cannes, suddenly meant nothing as Agatha built a wall between them so solid that Rio didn’t think she’d ever break through.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio hesitated before starting the engine and fully expected Agatha to move back in again but she didn’t.</p><p>A soft movement behind her told her that Agatha had instead chosen to take the flimsy handle again and she couldn’t help but wonder if it were punishment for asking about her husband.</p><p>Perhaps it was a reminder of the hand holding incident that had almost derailed their Cannes experience.</p><p>Perhaps it was something else.</p><p>Rio piloted them back to where they’d picked the jet ski up in the first place and kept the pace slow, not wanting to frighten Agatha for one and worried about what her reception would be when they got back onto dry land.</p><p>Once the engine was off, Agatha slipped from the jet ski without looking back and Rio found herself watching her as she handed her life vest back, took her sunglasses, and walked back up the beach to their loungers.</p><p>Alice and Jen were there already so she wouldn’t have a chance to bring up Agatha’s change in mood - not that she really wanted to.</p><p>She handed the keys back to the man and delivered the life vest into the little box, taking her sunglasses too, before heading back up.</p><p>Only, unlike Agatha, she was stopped.</p><p>It was a bunch of teenage Italian boys, no younger than seventeen, no older then about twenty one.</p><p>They crowded round Rio and started speaking in excitable, rapid Italian.</p><p>Rio picked up some of it: “Beautiful Rio!” “The actress, no?” But the rest was such a blurring of voices that even Rio’s Spanish couldn’t help her decipher it.</p><p>So she smiled and nodded and made to squeeze past them but one grabbed her around the waist and her body’s reaction could not have been more different to the reaction to Agatha grabbing her there earlier.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio shouted, shoving the boy’s arm away from herself and wrestling past him, she stumbled and fell into another body and made to shove it away before she realised who it was.</p><p>Agatha had run back down the beach to pull her away and Alice was right behind her, yelling at them in Spanish, hoping they’d understand that and if not, she added a few violent “fuck offs” that were surely universal.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she said huffily, even though Agatha hadn’t asked and was instead walking silently back to the sun beds with her, one hand holding her arm, the other wrapped around her as if someone would jump Rio any second.</p><p>“They’re just horny teenagers.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed but didn’t say anything still and Rio actually blushed when she pulled her down onto her sun lounger with her, crowding her so she sat closer to the top, and Rio leant back at an angle to rest her back against the sturdy wooden parasol that sat between Agatha and Jen’s beds.</p><p>“Where did he touch you?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and glanced up at Agatha, briefly distracted from where she’d been watching Alice march furiously back up the beach towards them.</p><p>“What? Nowhere.”</p><p>“I saw him <em>grab</em> you,” Agatha insisted and Rio sighed quietly, her eyes still on Alice as she got closer.</p><p>“Just around my waist.”</p><p>Rio missed Agatha’s furious look because she was reaching for Alice and pulling her towards her, shuffling forwards to get closer to her. “You okay?”</p><p>“Fine. Idiots. I’ve told you we should get you a-…”</p><p>“No,” Rio said sternly, scowling up at her best friend, “Do you know how embarrassing that would be?”</p><p>Alice huffed, “Less embarrassing than being tossed about by some prepubescent boys.”</p><p>“I was <em>not</em> tossed about,” Rio began to insist but she felt a hand on her knee that made her stop she saw Agatha shifting closer. Over her shoulder Jen was now hovering.</p><p>She glanced around at Agatha and saw that she looked more tense than even Alice and frowned at this reaction, unsure why it had bothered her so much. For someone who had practically gone silent on her ten minutes ago, she seemed to be caring pretty deeply about some idiots trying to get a reaction out of Rio.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice tried again but softer this time, “don’t move. I’ll go and get us all some drinks. Just… stay as incognito as possible.”</p><p>Rio huffed and reached for her earlier-discarded cap, and shoved it on her head unhappily.</p><p>Agatha’s hand had been dislodged where Rio had moved and Jen stepped around them to follow Alice.</p><p>Rio made to move to her own sun bed but was pulled back down by Agatha who was watching her sternly, “Just stay there.”</p><p>“Oh come on. They’re hardly the mafia. They’re stupid kids trying to impress their friends. I’m fine.”</p><p>“It’s assault.”</p><p>“Don’t be so dramatic.”</p><p>Rio met Agatha’s gaze and scowled across at her, wondering why the universe made her friends with Jen, and then why the universe made Alice friends with her, and why on god’s green earth it decided those two should fall in love and force her and Agatha together.</p><p>It seemed too cruel.</p><p>“Just wait until everyone’s back.”</p><p>“And what? You’ll protect me in the meantime?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed and she turned from Rio, “Fine. Whatever.”</p><p>Rio made a show of stepping onto her old sun bed and lifted her knees up to the sky, which she stared furiously at beneath her sunglasses.</p><p>They didn’t speak until Alice and Jen returned.</p><p>Alice seemed to have calmed down but she picked up on the tension immediately and perched beside Rio’s hip on the bed, passing her a spritz. “What’s happened?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio muttered at the same time as Agatha, both shooting the other a look.</p><p>“Jesus,” Jen sighed as she sat beside Agatha on the bed, “and people call me <em>dramatic</em>.”</p><p>“Listen,” Alice said, raising her free hand in the air, “when one of you eventually wins the Oscar-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen interjected quickly.</p><p>“It’s important you still both smile for the cameras. Which <em>means</em>,” she continued insistently as Rio began to protest, “That whatever this is, whatever the two of you are annoyed about needs to be fixed. Now please, Rio.”</p><p>“Why do you assume it’s my fault?”</p><p>Agatha and Jen both scoffed and Rio scowled as she sat up properly, narrowing her eyes at Agatha in particular, “she was being patronising.”</p><p>“You were assaulted. I was trying to-…”</p><p>“I wasn’t. It was kids.”</p><p>“Kids who grabbed you and-…”</p><p>“You touched me more on that jet ski than that boy did.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened to retort and then closed just as quickly again and Rio heard the words reverberate in her own mind and she realised how they must have sounded, what she was accusing Agatha of.</p><p>“Not,” she started, unsure how to escape this hole. “I-,” but Agatha was looking so mortified that she suddenly looked furious, her whole face morphing before Rio’s eyes as Rio finished quietly, “I didn’t mean it like that.”</p><p>Jen moved her hand to Agatha’s arm and shook her a little but her gaze was firm even when her words were not, and her eyes were on Rio. It felt like she were being warned. “Hey. Relax. She didn’t mean it. It’s been a stressful few minutes. Drink your drink.”</p><p>Rio watched in horror as Agatha turned away from her, her jaw tighter than she’d ever seen it and she felt Alice touch her leg and draw her attention to her as she murmured, “Apologise. Now.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly and handed her drink to Alice, standing slowly and going to stand at the end of Agatha’s bed, standing right in front of her so that Agatha had to turn her face away to avoid looking at her.</p><p>She felt small suddenly, strangely desperate to rewind time, take them back to their time on the ski where nothing else mattered but Agatha’s hands on her.</p><p>Rio glanced briefly at Jen who nodded once and took that as an ‘okay’ to go on.</p><p>She crouched down and placed a hand on the very edge of the bed, not daring to move any closer. “Hey.”</p><p>Agatha sighed heavily and slowly turned her gaze to Rio and miraculously, surprisingly, she’d softened. Her blue eyes were no longer steely and her jaw wasn’t as firm and more than anything she looked a little hurt.</p><p>Jen behind her made a move to go back to her bed but shot Rio a scowl and Alice placed Rio’s drink down before she disappeared to her own leaving Agatha and Rio in as private a little bubble as they could get on a public beach.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio said softly, “I didn’t mean that you-… I heard it after I said it. I was trying to say-…”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha reassured quietly.</p><p>And Rio nodded, her gaze dropping to Agatha’s hand where it sat on her knee. She didn’t reach for it, but she lifted her forefinger and touched her knuckle gently before she stood back up, picked up her drink and returned to her bed.</p><p>Perhaps a semi-peace with Agatha was all she could hope for.</p><p>A tentative friendship with the most famous woman in the world whom Rio just happened to want to kiss every second of the day.</p><p>It’d be fine.</p><p>Rio adjusted her sun lounger so she could sit up a bit more and took the opportunity to gaze out to sea.</p><p>Despite being grabbed in the same place Agatha had held her so tightly she could still feel Agatha’s hold on her, far stronger than the memory of the Italian youth.</p><p>She closed her eyes briefly and allowed herself to fantasise just for a second.</p><p>She thought of the woman next to her whispering a soft “fuck it” and sliding across to sit behind her on the lounger. She imagined her soft hands roaming her torso, touching her where she wanted to even on this crowded beach. And then they were on the jet ski again and Agatha’s hold was firm and her hand was sliding down her abdomen and dipping slowly beneath her thin bikini to touch the place that Rio most desperately wanted her.</p><p>But before she lost herself too much, before she tortured herself with these thoughts whilst the woman of her fantasises lay out next to her, she opened her eyes and took a long sip of her drink.</p><p>The cool bitterness was like a palate cleanser for her mind and she tried to focus on people watching rather than slipping back into her desperate desire for Agatha to hold her again.</p><p>But she couldn’t ride around a jet ski forever hoping that one day Agatha would jump back on.</p><p>She just had to power through the next couple of days and then seeing Agatha wouldn’t be so intense again. She’d have time and distance between them and she wouldn’t have to be this het up all the time.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness!”</p><p>Rio blinked into the sun and adjusted her cap slightly as she looked up at whoever was destroying their peace. From the corner of her eye she saw Agatha sit up slowly, and just behind her, on the furthest sunbed, she saw Alice her protective best friend sit up straight.</p><p>“I am such a big fan!”</p><p>Rio watched with interest as the woman before them beamed at Agatha and Agatha smiled warmly, holding her hand out to the woman, “Thank you. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”</p><p>“Oh my god, oh my god.” The woman shook Agatha’s hand roughly, beaming down at her and to Rio she looked a little drunk but maybe she was just excited. Understandable. Agatha often made her feel the same.</p><p>“Could I maybe get a selfie?”</p><p>“Oh I’d love to but I’m here relaxing with my friends. But appreciate your support, thank you.”</p><p>The woman looked more than devastated but only nodded frantically and disappeared off down the beach, stopping a few feet away to turn back and wave at Agatha.</p><p>“Sweet,” Rio teased gently, shooting Agatha a grin.</p><p>“Least my fans don’t grope.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and rolled her eyes, turning to watch the woman disappear along the sand.</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said suddenly, snapping in her face to get her attention, “You’re burning.”</p><p>Rio looked back over and looked down to where Jen was now staring and saw the light pink skin of Agatha’s chest.</p><p>She was sorry she was burning but it was a good excuse to look.</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you?”</p><p>“You’re so smug.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and Agatha swatted at her leg, which only made Rio laugh.</p><p>After that the rest of the beach day went by smoothly.</p><p>They each had two more cocktails and Agatha had half a dozen more people approach her before making their way back up to the villa where they all went their separate ways to the two bedrooms and each took it in turns to shower and change.</p><p>Rio opted for a linen striped shirt dress, figuring they were just lying around the house anyway.</p><p>She was first down and was reclined on the couch scrolling on her phone when Agatha appeared.</p><p>“Jen wants to go out.”</p><p>Rio dropped her phone to her side and sat up slowly on her elbows, frowning up at Agatha. “Really? Has she booked somewhere?”</p><p>“Yeah, just now. For her and Alice.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Rio sat up properly then, unsure what to do with this information. “Right. Okay.”</p><p>“I was going to order pizza and call it an early night.”</p><p>Rio swung her legs around and stood from the couch, “Sure. I’ll keep out of your way. Might head down for a drink or something later but-…”</p><p>“Have one with me before you go?”</p><p>Rio looked around and was surprised to see that Agatha hadn’t moved from where she’d originally stood when she entered the room.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little and Rio bit the inside of her cheek, feeling a little awkward suddenly.</p><p>“You look nice,” Agatha offered, so out of the blue that Rio raised her brows and glanced down at herself, tugging lightly at the fabric of her dress.</p><p>She brought her gaze back up and looked Agatha over properly for the first time. And wished she hadn’t.</p><p>She was wearing tan linen pants and a loose white T-shirt that…</p><p>“Oh shit,” Rio said quickly, stepping closer to inspect Agatha’s pink chest. She raised a hand towards it and then remembered herself and pulled her hand away.</p><p>“You were right,” Agatha said with an arched brow, “but if I hear one more smug word about it.”</p><p>“It looks worse.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quickly and met Agatha’s gaze, wondering where and how this relationship suddenly became so full of randomly blurred lines.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t have the chance to respond as Jen announced herself into the space, “Champagne, darlings? We’re celebrating!”</p><p>“Celebrating what?” Agatha asked suspiciously, but Rio nudged her arm and smirked, “Apparently their first proper date.”</p><p>Jen was in a flowing pink dress and heels and Rio had to admire both her taste and Alice’s.</p><p>Jen looked unreal.</p><p>And if Rio’s heart rate weren’t thrumming in tandem with wherever Agatha was in the room, she might just have a little crush on Jen too.</p><p>But Agatha had turned to her and squeezed her arm as she walked past and Rio knew that until she could shake this little crush she was done for.</p><p>No other woman could possibly match up.</p><p>Agatha took charge of popping and pouring the champagne, making sure everyone had an equal share and by the time the glasses were ready to be handed out, Alice had arrived too and Rio had snuck behind her, leaning around to embarrass her by placing multiple kisses to her cheek.</p><p>“Rio! Rio!”</p><p>Rio only gave in and let Alice go when she feared she’d hurt herself trying to wriggle from her grip and she laughed as Alice lightly slapped her cheek, pushing her away.</p><p>“You look good, Wu.”</p><p>“Don’t try that shit on me,” Jen warned Agatha with a glare and Agatha just rolled her eyes, holding the champagne flutes out to Alice and Rio now they were both behaving.</p><p>“You wish.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers brushed Agatha’s as she took her champagne and they locked eyes briefly and all the laughter in Rio’s face died in that instant and she knew three things for sure: she needed to get out the house that night, she needed to get drunk, and she needed to get laid.</p><p>They went to sit out by the pool, each taking a seat around the dining table setup there and each gazing at the view in silence for a while.</p><p>Rio noticed Jen and Alice’s hands meeting across the table and she smiled at her best friend before turning and catching Agatha watching her.</p><p>The brunette looked away when she was caught but Rio felt her stomach lurch at the idea that Agatha had been looking at her.</p><p>She cleared her throat softly and took a sip of her champagne just as Jen filled the silence: “So, Vidal. What’s next?”</p><p>“Uhh,” Rio started, glancing at Alice for help on this one.</p><p>“Eight weeks on a movie then off to Venice. We’re pretty back to back until the end of next year.”</p><p>“Wonderful,” Rio said quietly as she sipped her champagne.</p><p>“Where are you shooting?” Agatha asked and Rio racked her brains for a second before answering:</p><p>“London.”</p><p>She met Agatha’s gaze and saw her nod slowly, seemingly lost in thought as she took a sip of her drink.</p><p>“We’re the same. Agatha’s two shoots to contend with so no Venice for us. No rest for the wicked.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and watched the bubbles float about in her glass. “Especially not when campaigning.”</p><p>“Your first go-round,” Agatha said with a smirk, snapping out of her reverie, raising her brows at Rio, “and already complaining?”</p><p>“You make it sound like you’ve been doing this for decades.”</p><p>“I’m almost forty.”</p><p>“And with three Oscar nominations with one win and one on the way?” Rio matched Agatha’s smirk, “you’re practically a prodigy.”</p><p>She took another sip of her champagne.</p><p>“And what does that make you? A baby?”</p><p>Rio laughed and Agatha smiled across at her as Jen eyed them both suspiciously, “You two are being weird. What’s going on?”</p><p>“Leave them whilst they’re not biting each other,” Alice said with a wave of her hand, too happy to be concerned about anything Rio was doing.</p><p>“But, actually. The sun’s setting and you know what would be a good idea now everyone’s so happy?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but kept her gaze down on her drink, predicting what would be coming next.</p><p>“A quick snap for socials.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence and Jen interjected before Agatha could outright refuse again. “Baby, maybe not tonight.”</p><p>Rio glanced up at the nickname and couldn’t help but smile a little at Alice’s reaction.</p><p>She looked annoyed initially and then almost as if she’d realised what had happened she blushed a deep crimson and simply nodded.</p><p>Rio caught her eye and sent her a congratulatory wink across the table. She hadn’t got her photos but she’d clearly got her girl.</p><p>So Rio felt herself relax just a little in Agatha’s company again, perhaps the distance of the wide table between them helping her recalibrate a little.</p><p>But just as she felt herself fully relax Alice and Jen began to make a move. Rio felt the panic rise in her slowly at the prospect of being alone with Agatha, in this beautiful place, with the memory of her hands on her body.</p><p>She wasn’t sure she could take it.</p><p>“Actually,” she announced as Alice and Jen stood from the table.</p><p>All eyes landed on her and Rio felt Agatha’s gaze on her the most, “I’m going to come with you.”</p><p>“What? Rio, no. We’re-…”</p><p>“I know, I know. I’ll just walk down to the town with you, that’s all.”</p><p>Alice eyed her friend warily but nodded and Jen looked less than happy but Rio didn’t turn to Agatha to see her reaction.</p><p>Instead she pushed her chair back and cleared her throat as she turned to leave.</p><p>“Get back safe,” Agatha said quietly, and Rio paused for a second to acknowledge it, nodding just once but not quite looking at Agatha before she turned to leave with the other two.</p>

<p>Rio stumbled into the villa at well after three am.</p><p>She was hot and tired and considerably drunk but she’d also just spent the last few hours kissing, grinding on, and eventually fucking a hot Italian she met at a bar on the beach.</p><p>She’d had worse nights.</p><p>“Ow, fuck!”</p><p>She’d stumbled right into the console table in the hall.</p><p>Recovering herself and muttering under her breath about inconveniently placed objects, she moved through to the main living area - a little wobbly but managing not to crash into anything again.</p><p>There was movement on the large couch that made her stumble a little over her own feet and she blinked into the semi-darkness until the silhouette of a woman became the face and body of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“Oh. Di’ I wake you?”</p><p>Agatha watched Rio for a second, her gaze dropping to the purse still held loosely in her hand and the sand-covered sandals in her other.</p><p>“No, I was awake.”</p><p>“Is late,” Rio trilled, gesturing vaguely at the darkness as she stepped forwards and threw herself onto the couch beside Agatha.</p><p>“Ver’ late,” she added with an heavy slur to her voice.</p><p>Agatha shifted beside her and Rio rolled her head where it now lay on the back of the couch to look at her.</p><p>Agatha was pretty in this light.</p><p>Hell, Agatha was pretty in any light. But now, in the dark, at this hour, she looked softer. And Rio couldn’t help herself as she reached for her, her fingers just grazing her cheek.</p><p>The tips of her fingers travelled lazily along to the tip of Agatha’s nose, and Rio frowned as she walked her two fingers up to the bridge of it, then brushed them back down again.</p><p>“Who made you?” She asked reverently, her gaze now darting across Agatha’s face as she tried to comprehend the magnificence of it when she could barely speak a full sentence.</p><p>“D’you wait up for me?”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t moved or said anything the whole time Rio had been exploring her face but Rio’s hand fell down and landed just an inch or two from Agatha’s forearm and blue eyes fell to watch it. Even in her drunken state Rio thought Agatha looked cautious.</p><p>“I couldn’t sleep. That’s all.”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio hummed, in no fit state to be able to tell if the great Agatha Harkness was acting or not.</p><p>She pulled her hand back and lolled her head back around, closing her eyes.</p><p>“I drank too much.”</p><p>“I can see that.”</p><p>Rio laughed and turned back to Agatha, beaming stupidly at her and grinning even wider when Agatha’s lips twitched a little and she avoided eye contact.</p><p>“You did wait f’me.”</p><p>“You’re drunk.”</p><p>Rio laughed again and reached back out for Agatha, grabbing the fabric of her shirt by her shoulder, “You did!”</p><p>Agatha made to take Rio’s hand away and Rio simply turned her hand over to take Agatha’s, wriggling it between their faces.</p><p>“Knew you liked me.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and Rio laughed again, seeing this as an opportunity to move closer, her brain not firing on all cylinders but firing on what she considered to be the most important ones in that moment.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath as Rio moved closer to her, their hands still together but now pressed against Rio’s chest.</p><p>“You smell like alcohol and cheap perfume.”</p><p>“Mmm, that’s be Alessia.”</p><p>“Alessia?”</p><p>“Girl,” Rio clarified unhelpfully, not interested at all in this line of questioning.</p><p>“Who is she?”</p><p>Rio shrugged slightly and shuffled some more until she was an inch or two away from Agatha, still holding her hand firmly.</p><p>“S’a girl from the bar.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and Rio watched her blue eyes dart about and she wondered if Agatha were seeing two of her like she were seeing two of Agatha.</p><p>“And what did you do with this girl?”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, her brain already on more important matters and not on the fact that she’d potentially put herself in a very dangerous and stupid situation by fucking someone on a public beach.</p><p>“Jus’ kiss,” she lied, her eyes dropping to the place she’d like to kiss Agatha.</p><p>Agatha remained quiet and Rio did too, her gaze still down on Agatha’s lips as she conjured up the memory of the last time they were this close and her drunken mind won over as she whispered:</p><p>“D’you remember me?”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly and watched as Agatha’s brows rose and her head tilted a little to be at the same angle as Rio’s against the couch.</p><p>Rio couldn’t tell if Agatha hadn’t heard her or if she were so drunk she’d slurred her words too much so she tried again and moved their joined hands from resting against her own chest to resting against Agatha’s.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said slowly, pronouncing each syllable with only a sprinkle of slurring, “d’you remember me?”</p><p>Agatha remained silent again and Rio frowned a little as she dropped her gaze down from her face to focus somewhere at her chin, noticing Agatha’s little dimple there and clumsily raising her index finger from the claw she’d formed over Agatha’s hand to touch it.</p><p>Just as she made contact Agatha spoke softly, “Yes. You were as drunk then as you are now.”</p><p>Rio didn’t react for a while, her mind slowly catching up, working out exactly what Agatha was confirming. But steadily she raised her gaze, leaning in just a little more and grinning stupidly as Agatha watched her, “Y’remember? The bar?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and wriggled their joined hands between them, “I thought… too famous… too rich… too pretty… too…”</p><p>But her smile faded slowly as she remembered what had actually happened in the bathroom: that Agatha had spooked and left her alone.</p><p>“Husband,” she muttered quietly, closing her eyes and rolling her head away, her body turning away from Agatha’s but her hand was still being held. “You’ve husband.”</p><p>“Let me take you to bed.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice drifted into her consciousness as Rio squeezed her eyes shut, trying to focus on what was real.</p><p>She could feel the couch cushions beneath her, the sand between her toes, Agatha’s hand in her own.</p><p>She could smell the sweat from her skin from a night of dancing and sex, the fresh lemons in a bowl on the coffee table, Agatha’s perfume.</p><p>She could hear the crickets chirping outside through the open windows, the soft tick of a clock nearby, Agatha moving slowly beside her.</p><p>She could taste the alcohol on her breath, the flavoured lip balm of the girl she’d been groping all night, and the indignity of her current situation.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio opened her eyes slowly and saw Agatha leaning over her, her blue eyes bright in the dim, her lips parted as if she were about to say something else, a strand of hair falling delicately across her brow.</p><p>Rio reached to tuck it clumsily behind her ear again and Agatha let her.</p><p>“Let me take you to bed.”</p><p>Rio huffed a little but didn’t move, releasing her hold on Agatha’s hand and dropping her own hand into her lap instead.</p><p>“Alice an’ Jen? Di’ they get back okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and pursed her lips as she stepped away from Rio, holding her hands out to her now in a move that even Rio recognised as a request, not a demand.</p><p>She accepted them and allowed Agatha to pull her to her feet, mercifully not stumbling too much and correcting herself before their bodies collided.</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio mumbled quietly, stealing her hands back again from Agatha and making for the staircase, feeling ever so slightly less wobbly than when she’d walked in.</p><p>“You’ll have to take my bed,” Agatha said from somewhere behind her, “Jen and Alice… well they’re in the other room.”</p><p>Rio had reached the stairs and swivelled to look at Agatha so quickly that she stumbled and fell onto her ass on the second stair. Just as Agatha reached her, she released a laugh and buried her face in her hands, “Finally. She sealed the deal.”</p><p>“Here,” Agatha said firmly, not offering anymore where she took Rio by the arms and lifted her to her feet again, “I’ll help.”</p><p>Rio was still halfway to a laugh and she grinned at Agatha, for a second seeing two pairs of eyes looking at her until they melted into just one. “She’s liked her for ages. Ages and ages and ages.”</p><p>“I know. Jen’s been head over heels for a while too.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, a smile playing on her lips, as she watched Agatha survey her closely, trying to gage how balanced she was.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she reassured, emphasising the “ine” a little to much for someone who was “fine”.</p><p>“I can make it from here.”</p><p>Agatha looked a little like she’d flinched at this but Rio was still trying to keep her mind steady as she turned away from Agatha and the hold on her arms dropped.</p><p>She took two more steps and then stopped, her hand secure on the bannister so at least she could be sure if she fell she wouldn’t fall far.</p><p>“Okay?” Agatha asked, having not moved from the bottom of the stairs, now just four down from Rio.</p><p>“Where’re you sleeping?”</p><p>Rio turned slowly around, almost stumbling as she crossed one foot over the other and watching in something close to amusement as Agatha lurched for her and took two steps up.</p><p>“Careful. The couch.”</p><p>“Silly,” Rio said with an eye roll, shaking her head as she turned back around and began to take slow steps up the rest of the staircase.</p><p>It was when she hit the landing that she registered movement behind her.</p><p>The creaky top step had given her away and Rio paused for a second to determine how she felt about Agatha following her to bed.</p><p>Mortified, for one. Indignant, for another.</p><p>But somewhere deep down she felt warmed by it, touched that a one-time Oscar winner were making sure she didn’t plummet to her death in a villa in Italy.</p><p>And Agatha remained with her as she crawled into bed.</p><p>Rio went to her usual side in the unfamiliar bed and didn’t even stop to brush the sand from her feet as she buried herself beneath the blankets.</p><p>She heard her name muffled somewhere above her but was determined to sleep, determined to stay hidden, until…</p><p>“Rio Vidal, get on your side.”</p><p>The warm embrace of darkness had been torn from her and Rio scrunched her face up against the light as Agatha threw the blankets off of her.</p><p>“On your side,” she repeated again as Rio remained still on her back and tried to grab the blankets back up and over her face.</p><p>Agatha huffed a little and gave up on the War of the Blanket and instead ducked down to tuck her fingers around Rio’s side and heave her onto her side.</p><p>Rio allowed this and didn’t even complain when Agatha patted her leg to get her to move it up so she was in the recovery position. “Don’t move, okay? Can’t have you dying in the night. They’ll think I killed the competition.”</p><p>Rio only laughed a little, the noise catching in her throat as she began to succumb to sleep, “You’ll win. Better actress.”</p><p>Agatha hummed softly and Rio felt a gentle touch to her cheek which made her eyes flutter open and she blinked slowly as she readjusted her vision again, aware suddenly that Agatha was close, perhaps as close as she’d been on the couch.</p><p>“I’m gonna sit with you for a second. Just until you’re asleep.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was a whisper now, a gentle timbre that Rio hadn’t heard before. It was so soft if her lips hadn’t moved with it Rio might have missed it.</p><p>But she frowned where she lay and moved her hand up to capture the fingers now tenderly brushing her hair behind her ear.</p><p>“Jus’stay.”</p><p>Rio thought she heard the soft hitch of a breath but she couldn’t tell if it was from her or Agatha and she moved Agatha’s hand down to press her knuckles to her lips. It was barely a kiss, more a brush, and Agatha reacted only to it by nodding and then releasing Rio’s hand.</p><p>Rio curled a little more into herself when Agatha moved away and she closed her eyes as she felt the mattress dip on the other side of her.</p><p>By the time Agatha had slipped beneath the sheets, Rio’s breathing had evened out entirely and she was fast asleep.</p><p>Rio woke twice in the night. Or the early hours of the morning, as it was.</p><p>At just after four am, she woke with a start and panicked when she didn’t recognise the room, momentarily forgetting where she was.</p><p>Italy.</p><p>Villa.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Turning slowly over, her eyes landed on the back of Agatha Harkness’s sleeping form, turned away from her and as far over on the other side of the bed as she could be.</p><p>Rio watched her for a few seconds, seeing the steady rhythm of her ribs expanding beneath her T-shirt, and the fresh horror of her entrance just a few hours ago hit her.</p><p>She turned over quickly then and forced herself back into sleep.</p><p>The second time she woke, she woke slower, the creeping dawn easing her where the shutters remained at half mast.</p><p>Blinking into the light she allowed herself to adjust to being awake for a few seconds this time, taking a mental inventory of her body as well as her mind before she slowly turned to see Agatha again.</p><p>This time, Agatha was on her back, still far from her.</p><p>But her hand was flung out towards her and Rio looked down upon it and saw that she wasn’t wearing her wedding ring. She didn’t know why she’d spotted this so suddenly, as if anybody might have, but it struck her the moment she’d laid eyes upon Agatha’s long fingers curled towards her.</p><p>Sure Agatha was still asleep, Rio let her eyes wander up her arm, taking in the light freckles and seeing the subtle shadow of her bicep that she’d felt when Agatha held her on the jet ski the day before.</p><p>Her gaze roamed over her shoulder, to the curve of her jaw, along the plains and lines of a face that people would go to war for.</p><p>Agatha was tragically beautiful, and Rio found herself envying the artists who got to work every day with such a canvas. The people who got to paint her lips and cheeks with rouge, who blackened her eyelashes and were paid to focus in on eyes so hypnotic Rio was sure she could drown in their blue pools.</p><p>And her husband. Agatha’s husband who had access to this face. The man who could kiss it and hold it at will. Rio hoped Ralph knew how lucky he was. She hoped he treasured and worshiped Agatha the way she deserved.</p><p>Though the reality was that she didn’t think Ralph knew at all what he had in Agatha. And she didn’t think he treated her the way she should be treated.</p><p>A movement of Agatha’s made Rio fall back to earth with a jolt and she turned quickly back into her side, furious with herself that she’d been staring at a woman she barely knew whilst she slept.</p><p>She’d mortified herself enough. If Agatha had woken and caught her she was sure she’d have been blacklisted from Hollywood immediately. Me Too’d so fast she would barely be able to breathe the name ‘Agatha Harkness’ again.</p><p>Getting to sleep again after that was a little more difficult.</p><p>The threat of her hangover had now been confirmed.</p><p>Her head was a stormy cloud of regret and pain and her stomach churned with the memory of last night.</p><p>She’d picked up some girl from a bar, danced with her until her feet hurt, and then taken her to the beach to get out some of the frustration she’d been feeling that day.</p><p>God, she hoped no one had caught them.</p><p>She knew it couldn’t have looked good, or glamorous, or sexy.</p><p>It must have looked sweaty and desperate and more than a little pathetic.</p><p>But miraculously, sleep came back to her. Perhaps, she thought as she woke up a few hours later, it was the universe repaying her for making her spend days in close proximity with her longest running crush and most intoxicating person alive.</p><p>The third time she woke she was alone.</p><p>Rio stretched her sore limbs and felt the grainy rub of sand by her feet, as unwelcome as it always was when not on the beach.</p><p>She leant across to touch the bed beside her and found Agatha’s side to be cool which meant she’d disappeared a while ago.</p><p>Perhaps Rio had dreamt her there.</p><p>But no, usually her imagination was a little kinder to her than that.</p><p>She groaned as she rolled into a sitting position on the edge of the bed and rubbed at her eyes before noticing a little care package on the side in the form of a tall glass of water and some aspirin.</p><p><em>Agatha</em>, she thought.</p><p>After drinking down the majority of the water and using it to help knock back the aspirin, she padded through to wash away her sins in the shower.</p><p>There was steam still evident against the glass partition that told her Agatha hadn’t long showered here and she wondered if she’d taken pains to be quiet or if Rio were so dead to the world that Agatha could have recited her inevitable Oscar speech right by her ear and she wouldn’t have noticed.</p><p>Beneath the hot stream of water though, everything felt better.</p><p>The pummelling stream against her skin woke her up to what she could remember of the night before.</p><p>The scent of the perfume of the Italian she’d taken to the beach, the sight of Agatha on the couch, the feel of her hand in her own.</p><p>Rio needed to get a grip. And fast.</p><p>She’d been on the verge of pining last night, of melting before her fellow actress without any thoughts on whether this was a good move personally or professionally.</p><p>Agatha could help to make or break her career.</p><p>She had to do better than this.</p><p>And so, determined and now clean, she stepped out and dried herself as best she could before risking it and slipping into her old room.</p><p>Alice and Jen were nowhere to be found so Rio took her time finding a navy blue bikini, linen shorts and a thin green t-shirt to go over the top. She checked herself in the nearby mirror and decided she could undoubtedly look worse… but she could also look a whole lot better.</p><p>But it would have to do.</p><p>Stepping out into the Italian sun, Rio felt another wave of goodness sink into her body.</p><p>It was what she needed. Sun, sea, silence.</p><p>In front of her lay the pool with the distant view of the bay of Positano. A view Rio could never be sick of.</p><p>But movement on one of the loungers before her alerted her to another view nobody could be sick of.</p><p>“Hey,” she said cautiously, unsure what the reception would be like this morning as she approached the sun lounger beside Agatha’s and chose not to look at her as she took a seat.</p><p>“Hey. Not dead, I see.”</p><p>“Probably thanks to you.”</p><p>Agatha made a noncommittal noise that Rio took as not unfriendly and she stole a glance at the woman, seeing her half under the shade of a parasol, only her legs laying out in the midday sun.</p><p>She’d opted for a black one piece today with cut outs at her sides and was determinedly reading a book. Rio noticed a half-finished cappuccino beside her and the fact that Agatha’s cheeks were a little flushed. Too much sun, she thought.</p><p>“I’m sorry about last night. I got too drunk and I-…”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>“No, really. I was probably being a nightmare and really embarrassed myself and-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha looked up suddenly, her face stern but her eyes a little softer than Rio might have expected. “It’s fine. We’ve all been drunk before.”</p><p>Nodding slowly, Rio turned to place her heels on the edge of the bed, wrapping her arms around her legs.</p><p>“Thanks for… helping. Getting me to bed… the water this morning…”</p><p>Agatha was watching her still, her book held up as if she’d turn away any moment to continue reading, but she hadn’t.</p><p>“I think we should clarify something,” she said, her voice a little softer than before. “About when we met.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and nodded, her gaze drifting down to Agatha’s arm as it flexed where she held her book. She wanted to press her face against it, breathe in the sun lotion, hide from the world with Agatha.</p><p>“I was drunk and…”</p><p>But Rio looked up suddenly because Agatha had turned around, placing her book on the bed beside her and her feet on the ground.</p><p>Her ring was back on. Had Rio noticed it wasn’t before? She had a vague memory of thinking about Agatha’s wedding ring. She hoped she hadn’t said anything.</p><p>As if reading her mind, Agatha reached for it, her thumb and forefinger of her right hand now twirling it as she continued: “I was missing Ralph. And you were charming and funny and I… I guess I just… anyway, I’m not into girls. I made a mistake. One I wouldn’t have gone through with anyway. You were too drunk, and too young, and… well it wasn’t anything. I’m not into girls. Nothing happened. I’m happily married. Rio, can we leave it there?”</p><p>Rio watched Agatha closely during her little speech, seeing the way her diction picked up the closer she got to the end of it, the more urgent her words were coming out. How quickly and with practised fingers she was spinning her ring. How Ralph’s name was thrown away from her lips whereas Rio’s was breathed.</p><p>It hurt her brain too much to think about. To assess and breakdown Agatha Harkness’s worst performance to date.</p><p>But Rio was also aware that she was deathly hungover, that she was possibly still drunk, and that no mind is strong enough to fight the delusions that came with a crush.</p><p>She had to focus on what Agatha had said, not what she hoped she meant.</p><p>She had a husband. A husband she loved, and had missed, and Rio was maybe just charming enough that a straight person could want to be close for a second, too close. But that was it. Rio was a girl and Agatha wasn’t into that. And she was happy with her husband.</p><p>Reasonable. Fine. She had to believe it because anything else would destroy her.</p><p>“Okay,” she said slowly, her mind still reeling from its swinging back and forth between wanting to believe Agatha and wanted to accuse her of… of what? Wanting to kiss her? Eight years ago having a crush on her?</p><p>Insane.</p><p>But Agatha had dropped her gaze and was now staring at the ring she held still on her finger and Rio couldn’t help but reach for her hand, catching her fingers and feeling Agatha curl her own around Rio’s.</p><p>“I’m sorry if I implied anything last night. It was so long ago and… it’s just not often a movie star has you up against a bathroom door, that’s all.”</p><p>It wasn’t all, but Rio had to push through, ‘yes, and-ing’ Agatha’s tale to make the both of them feel better.</p><p>This had to be it, she decided.</p><p>Rio could no longer live in this world where Agatha might have, at one point, wanted her.</p><p>So she squeezed Agatha’s hand gently and smiled when she met her gaze again, “You’re burning a little. Will I grab more lotion?”</p><p>Agatha nodded but didn’t say anything and Rio slowly pulled away, but Agatha tugged her hand as she stood and Rio turned back, looking down with a slight frown.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s heart hammered in her chest and she watched as Agatha frowned back at her, her other hand coming up to her forearm as she stood slowly before her, standing too close between the two adjacent sun beds.</p><p>Suddenly it was eight years ago.</p><p>Only rather than a grimy Chicago bar, they were standing on the edge of a multi-million dollar villa on the Amalfi Coast.</p><p>Agatha’s hand still held hers and Agatha’s other hand was holding her arm so firmly as if Rio had looked like she’d bolt. And Rio didn’t know what was happening, didn’t understand what had happened between ‘I’m happily married’ and Agatha suddenly looking at her like she was the first hot meal she’d seen after a long winter of rations.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>And all the thoughts left Rio’s brain because Agatha Harkness was staring at her lips.</p><p>Her lips that the night before had been all over some girl from a bar, using her as a quick fix to get the thoughts of Agatha out of her head.</p><p>It felt sick, it felt cruel, it felt… and then Agatha had pulled away. She’d released her hold on her and by the time Rio’s brain had caught up, Agatha was halfway back to the villa.</p><p>“I’ll get you a coffee,” she was saying, “and maybe an aperitivo.”</p><p>Rio felt a little faint and she wasn’t sure if it was the hangover, the heat of the sun, or the mixed signals that flared with every other interaction she had with Agatha.</p><p>Was she messing with her? Goading her to try something? Was she wanting Rio to make a move so she could accuse her of something awful?</p><p>Before she could even think on it Rio had slipped her feet into Agatha’s discarded sandals and was marching to the front of the house.</p><p>She bypassed the open plan kitchen area and from the corner of her eye saw Agatha turn to her. She even thought she heard her say her name.</p><p>But Rio was too fast, too determined to escape and catch her breath, and before anything else could happen, she’d exited the villa.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It smelled sweet.</p><p>The kind of sweet that reminded you of candy.</p><p>Though of course it was the ghosts of cocktails past: of spilled grenadine and rum.</p><p>It was dimly lit to hide the sins of the patrons, to disguise the grime of the glasses and the stains of the seats.</p><p>There were posters on every inch of every wall. But of nothing, of no one, as inconsequential as the people they smiled down upon.</p><p>This was the kind of bar that nobody frequented and where everybody who did was called as such.</p><p>And so it was the perfect bar for the little improv troupe to fall into.</p><p>Some celebrating; some commiserating.</p><p>Agatha Harkness, Oscar hopeful and Hollywood heavyweight was in their midst, and so no one was on their best behaviour.</p><p>“She’s fucking hot,” someone breathed into Rio Vidal’s ear as she stared at the actress from where she sat squeezed in the corner of a curved booth with her fellow improvers - the underlings of the troupe.</p><p>“God she’s like one of these statues,” someone else said from across the way.</p><p>“A fucking hottie with a body,” Alice added helpfully with half her mind on her bottle of beer and half her mind on Agatha.</p><p>“A goddess,” Rio concluded, her own attention split between Agatha and the beer she cradled in her hands; the fifth of the night, the last she could afford.</p><p>“Seriously, I hear her husband is hot too. Have you seen him? It’s actually unreal.”</p><p>“Unfair.”</p><p>“Sad,” Alice murmured as Rio leant into her and laughed against her ear.</p><p>Agatha Harkness had been the talk of the night.</p><p>Because of course.</p><p>She’d rocked up without any warning. Simply because she was filming in Chicago and one of the improv leaders had been an extra on the set.</p><p>Perhaps she was lonely, perhaps she was bored, but it didn’t matter. She’d turned up.</p><p>On the verge of an Oscar nomination and at their little show; the troupe felt insane with it.</p><p>They felt crazy with the power.</p><p>And Rio Vidal felt nothing at all.</p><p>She’d worked so hard and still nothing.</p><p>Alice had been telling her for years she had something and yet, and yet…</p><p>But then she’d spotted Agatha Harkness in the crowd and she’d shown off.</p><p>She’d been louder and funnier and sharper and better than she’d been in weeks.</p><p>Because Agatha was there. Because Agatha was a woman to impress.</p><p>And now she sat, drunk, convinced she’d left an impression on the woman who’d had eyes on her all night.</p><p>But girls in the audience who stared at Rio usually came over. They usually cashed in on the time spent watching her.</p><p>They usually weren’t famous actresses with handsome husbands.</p><p>So Rio sat, unadmired and tipsy, watching as the seniors in her group absorbed the smiles and the laughs from Agatha Harkness.</p><p>In any just world Rio would be there too.</p><p>But then Alice shook her shoulder and she turned to her best friend and smiled lamely, her eyes already hooded and slow to cooperate with her hazy mind.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You’re staring again. She’s hot but she’s not interested.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and then shrunk back a little, turning back to the small group at the bar that encircled the object of her most keen attention.</p><p>She raised her beer to her lips, now warm and flat, and saw that Agatha was looking at her.</p><p>Not for the first time that night.</p><p>Rio suddenly felt warmer than the beer that slipped down her throat, felt dizzier than the tequila earlier had made her feel, felt every second that they maintained eye contact.</p><p>Agatha was the one to break the eye contact.</p><p>Because of course she was.</p><p>Rio was drunk, she knew that.</p><p>She was probably staring, she assumed that.</p><p>Agatha was the most famous, most beautiful woman she’d ever seen.</p><p>How could she not stare?</p><p>She told herself she had to behave.</p><p>She looked away, focused on her friends. Ignored the way the conversation kept steering around to Agatha again - if she enjoyed the show, how rich she was, if she would introduce anyone to her agent, if she’d come back to see their summer show.</p><p>After two more too-warm beers and an unwise shot of tequila bought by Alice, she stumbled her way into the bathroom.</p><p>There, above the cracked porcelain of the sink, she took slow breaths to stem the nausea that threatened to overcome her pleasantly drunken state.</p><p>“Feeling okay?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head in the direction of the speaker, assuming a friend, unable to recognise the familiar voice she’d only previously heard through a screen.</p><p>The bathroom descended into silence again and as Rio calmed her system down she felt well enough to turn and lean back against the basin.</p><p>Apparently she still wasn’t alone.</p><p>“You were good.”</p><p>Brown eyes flashed open and Agatha Harkness came into focus, as magnificent as Rio remembered.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio uttered, a little too drunk for her body to catch up with her mind.</p><p>“Whadd’re you doing here?”</p><p>Agatha smiled and leant up against the basin next to Rio’s, watching her with blue eyes that made Rio feel weak at the knees.</p><p>“You’re the best of them.”</p><p>“Hmm?” Rio hummed a soft question, rubbing her temple as she tried to focus on what the goddess in the room with her was saying.</p><p>“You’re drunk.”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>“Definitely.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rubbed her face with her hands, unable to deny or fight back.</p><p>“Do you want me to get you some water?”</p><p>Rio dropped her hands.</p><p>She looked across at Agatha, frowning at her as she stared at her. She was closer than she’d been before, she was sure of it.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Ah-gah-tha.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and tilted her head to watch Rio, her eyes darting from heavy dark eyes to a lopsided grin, “That’s my name.”</p><p>“S’pretty.”</p><p>“You think?”</p><p>“Pretty.”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly and Rio’s gaze dropped. Dropped to perfect teeth, to perfect lips.</p><p>“Smile’s pretty.”</p><p>Agatha moved a little closer and Rio’s gaze dropped again.</p><p>She looked at the plain white T-shirt Agatha was wearing. She looked at the pale arm at her side. The long fingers. The rings on one of them.</p><p>She reached for them.</p><p>“S’pretty,” she said again, her voice dropping as she held Agatha’s left hand, reverently touching the diamond there.</p><p>“Lucky sonofabitch,” Rio murmured almost to herself but not quite low enough to not be caught.</p><p>If she’d looked up she’d have seen Agatha raise her brows at her.</p><p>“It’s Rio, isn’t it? Like ‘river’.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Rio continued to toy with the rings on Agatha’s finger, her gaze drifting in focus as she did.</p><p>“Vidal?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>Rio began to frown where she still held Agatha’s hand, turning her engagement ring over so she could no longer see the diamond.</p><p>“I’d get you a bigger one. S’big everyone could see.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Rio looked back up again, smiling a little, now confident that she absolutely could buy Agatha Harkness a larger ring than her rich financier husband had.</p><p>His five million net worth was nothing to her five dollars, seventy cents in her current account.</p><p>Agatha seemed amused enough that she wasn’t deterred, that her confidence grew, that she was convinced she could do it and Agatha would welcome it.</p><p>“So pretty.”</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Mmhm?”</p><p>“You sure I can’t get you that water?”</p><p>Rio grinned, dropping her hold of Agatha’s hand and forgetting she’d just promised her a much larger ring.</p><p>“No. Only delicious, shitty beer f’me.”</p><p>She threw her hands to her face again and huffed out a breath, laughing at her own little joke.</p><p>But then she was moving.</p><p>A soft hand on her wrist steered her and her eyes were now uncovered, unfocused on the back of a brunette head of hair as she was pulled to a toilet stall.</p><p>She was vaguely aware of her legs moving beneath her and her body responding to something her mind couldn’t quite grasp yet.</p><p>But then she felt a slight darkness descend.</p><p>A dimmer light than before.</p><p>The hard feel of something behind her back.</p><p>The scent of something lightly floral, very welcome.</p><p>A click.</p><p>A breath.</p><p>Two hands either side of her head.</p><p>“How drunk are you?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“How drunk are you?”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, her eyes heavier now than they had felt before.</p><p>Maybe because it was darker, maybe because her body was fully relaxed back against something, maybe because she was breathing in something that felt soothing, felt safe.</p><p>“No’drunk.”</p><p>She blinked as she looked into blue eyes, much closer than they’d been before.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of her mind she realised the scent that was soothing her so was Agatha Harkness.</p><p>She laughed at the absurdity of this realisation, at the knowledge that Agatha was close enough that she moved her hand just a few inches and she held the hem of Agatha’s t-shirt in her thumb and forefinger.</p><p>“Pretty.”</p><p>“Can I kiss you, Rio Vidal?”</p><p>Rio’s expression changed as her brain caught up with the words breathed out before her.</p><p>Her fingers were still clutching the fabric of the shirt of the woman in front of her.</p><p>And she could only breathe in her perfume, could only see those blue eyes now focused further down her own face, could only feel her warm breath against her lips.</p><p>Rio had always thought she belonged on the stage.</p><p>She thought she belonged to an audience.</p><p>But now, as drunk as she was, her brain recognised something that when she was sober again only her soul would acknowledge: she belonged to, and with, Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“I… <em>please</em>.”</p><p>Agatha leant in and Rio sucked in a sharp breath of anticipation, her eyes fluttering closed as she waited for the pressure of those perfect lips against her own.</p><p>Perhaps it was punishment for closing her eyes when she had someone so beautiful before her, perhaps it was simply that her luck had run out, but the noise of people entering the bathroom meant that Agatha had pulled away.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed open when she felt the loss of her and she saw the flash of horror in blue eyes.</p><p>But then a hand was on her shoulder and she was moved aside so that the door could be opened and Agatha could disappear.</p><p>It happened so quickly that Rio missed the soft “sorry” as Agatha had passed. She didn’t register the soft squeeze of her arm, the pain in her gaze as she swept away.</p><p>And Rio was left in the bathroom stall, silent and in a state of shock.</p><p>She managed, just, to turn and lock the stall door again, keeping still and quiet until the women who had ruined her night had left.</p><p>When alone again, she reappeared in the main bar, lost and desperately horny, but unclear and unsure as to what had just happened.</p><p>It was Alice who greeted her on her way out.</p><p>Alice who wrapped an arm around her.</p><p>Alice who informed her that Agatha Harkness had bolted not five minutes ago.</p><p>“Maybe got her fill of slumming it for the night,” she’d said against Rio’s ear, as if she’d welcome the joke, as if she’d laugh at it.</p><p>But Rio could only feel the loss of Agatha.</p><p>The aching need she’d had for her that would never now be satiated.</p><p>And so she accepted the beer thrust towards her, took more shots than she should have been allowed, and she stumbled home with Alice.</p><p>By morning she was a shell of her former self, with only a vague memory of Agatha, and a deep loneliness she couldn’t explain.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio tread the familiar path down to the port, focusing on her breathing, on stretching her aching muscles out, and on everything that wasn’t Agatha Harkness.</p>
<p>The things she knew about her: married to Ralph, a son called Nicky, a well-respected and incredibly famous actress, someone who would look after you when you were drunk, someone who tried to protect you, someone who set Rio’s body on fire and mind and heart racing.</p>
<p>But straight. Straight and married to a man.</p>
<p>Ralph.</p>
<p>By the time Rio had walked to the other side of the bay she felt better.</p>
<p>Distance from Agatha seemed to help. And in the back of her mind she knew she was still suffering from an almighty hangover which can’t have helped the situation.</p>
<p>Because nothing had happened. Agatha had looked a little too closely at her, but then again she was an actress. Perhaps she was studying her because she was interested in human behaviour, in how others carried themselves, in the physicality of a person so different to herself. That must be it.</p>
<p>They were both adults, both in the same profession, both currently working their asses off to convince the world they were worthy of the highest award Hollywood could provide.</p>
<p>Insofar as all that was true, they were colleagues and rivals. It was an intense relationship anyway.</p>
<p>Made more intense by Rio’s inability to get a grip.</p>
<p>As her lips pressed against the cool glass of the beer she’d secured herself at a small chiosco opposite the bay, all thoughts of Agatha disappeared.</p>
<p>She was a goddamn movie star. She was one of the favourites to win an Oscar. She got a twelve minute standing ovation at Cannes. She was young and hot and free and could get any woman she wanted.</p>
<p>By the time she was on her second beer, she heard her name being called across the way and she turned to squint into the sun until the familiar figure of Alice Wu-Gulliver appeared before her looking concerned and a little annoyed.</p>
<p>“Where the fuck have you been?”</p>
<p>Rio held up her beer and turned to the barman to ask for another. “Right here. What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Agatha said you practically ran away this morning.”</p>
<p>Rio scoffed and turned to watch as Alice took a seat on the low stool beside her, “I just need some air.”</p>
<p>“And more alcohol? We heard you stumble in last night. Agatha was discreet with the details but from what I gather you were a total mess.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes and turned back to begin drawing idly into the condensation on her glass.</p>
<p>“I hear you finally sealed the deal?”</p>
<p>“Don’t ignore me. What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, Alice. Only our little escape for two days to get some rest and alone time for the first time in <em>ages</em> has been interrupted by your new girlfriend and her boss.”</p>
<p>Alice was silent for a while but accepted the beer placed before her with a soft murmur of a “grazie”.</p>
<p>“I knew you were pissed about it.”</p>
<p>“I’m not pissed I’m just… hungover. Tired. Embarrassed.”</p>
<p>“How bad was it?”</p>
<p>Rio sighed heavily and rubbed her temple, “She had to put me in the recovery position. And I’m pretty sure I asked her to stay in the bed with me.”</p>
<p>“My god, Rio. I told you to make friends, not proposition her.”</p>
<p>“I <em>didn’t</em> proposition her. I just… maybe held her hand a bit and sat a little close. And in case <em>you</em> forgot, <em>you</em> are the reason we technically had to share a bed in the first place.”</p>
<p>Rio sighed heavily and Alice grimaced into her beer.</p>
<p>After a beat of silence Alice eventually said:</p>
<p>“Jen says she likes you. Says she’s never seen Agatha soften for someone so quickly before.”</p>
<p>Groaning a little, Rio turned to look at Alice with a deep furrow in her brow, “She’s an actress. The best one we have. She’s just playing along because you and Jen are all over each other and she’ll be stuck with me for the next few months until this goddamn season is over. And even then, if you both decide it’s a longterm thing… we’re stuck.”</p>
<p>Alice’s smiling face softened and she reached across to place her beer-cooled hand on Rio’s bare knee, providing a welcome balm against the heat of the day.</p>
<p>“Actually, I think she likes you. Most people do so it’s not that shocking. Maybe relax around her a little. I know you’re a fan and she’s a hot woman but… try to relax. Like you say, we’ve a lot of time to get through and it would be better if you two could actually be friends.”</p>
<p>Rio huffed and despite the welcome coolness of it she pushed Alice’s hand from her knee. “I’m not sure we’ll ever actually be friends.”</p>
<p>“Why not? She’s sparky. She’s funny. Jen says she’s generous and loyal and her kid is cute. Plus she got your sorry ass to bed last night. The amount of times I’ve had to bribe you to bed with more tequila I cannot even count.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah. She’s a <em>Saint</em>.”</p>
<p>“Only to her friends. Otherwise she’s a bitch,” Alice smirked, “whereas you’re the opposite. Great with everyone else and an absolute horror to anyone who knows you.”</p>
<p>“Oh fuck off.”</p>
<p>Alice released a cackle as Rio tried to push her off her stool and they both received unimpressed glares from the posers and preeners of Positano as they walked by.</p>
<p>When they’d both calmed down and Rio was well into half of her beer, Alice quickly catching up, Rio broached the next most important subject of the holiday: Alice’s romance.</p>
<p>“So. How was it? Earth-shattering?”</p>
<p>Alice smiled and blushed a little, turning slightly to try and hide it. “I really like her. I’m hopeful it’s… that maybe she’s the one.”</p>
<p>“The one?” Rio asked in complete surprise, her worldview changing slightly as she took Alice in. “You can’t leave me single and alone. That’s not the deal.”</p>
<p>“There was no <em>deal</em>, Rio Vidal. Just your assumption that we’d be single forever and die hand in hand in our late nineties on the terrace of our beachfront property.”</p>
<p>“And you’ve decided to renege on this deal for a hot woman with at least a foot on you?”</p>
<p>“Not a foot,” Alice insisted with a laugh, “But yes. I hope so. I think, I think I really like this one.”</p>
<p>“Then I’m happy for you,” Rio grinned genuinely, reaching to take Alice’s hand and squeeze it gently. “And I can’t imagine for a second that she wouldn’t feel the same.”</p>
<p>“We’re taking it slow but yeah,” Alice grinned back and squeezed Rio’s hand right back. “So you and Agatha might just have to deal with each other far beyond the season.”</p>
<p>Rio hummed and turned back to take a drink of her beer, wondering how a life with Agatha constantly in it would work out. But just because Alice was with Jen didn’t mean Agatha would be there every time she saw her.</p>
<p>But this belief was shattered when Alice spoke again: “So Jen was suggesting a bit of a triple date night. Me, you, Agatha, Ralph, and Jen.”</p>
<p>Rio almost choked on her beer and turned to Alice with wide eyes, “What? You can’t be serious. I’m not fifth wheeling.”</p>
<p>“Oh come on! You’d be there for me. I’d need you there!”</p>
<p>“Alice, no. That’s insane. It would be humiliating. Last time I saw Ralph… it was a disaster. I already told you yesterday: no more favours.”</p>
<p>“Rio, you’re the most popular piece of ass in Hollywood right now. Get over yourself and either find a girl to bring or come alone. Who cares. Do this for me.”</p>
<p>Rio huffed but smiled just a little, the beer easing her down just enough to be able to accept the compliment and lessen the inevitable humiliation of rocking up somewhere with two other couples.</p>
<p>“Fine. But only for you. And only once.”</p>
<p>“Deal.”</p>
<p>They finished their beers and Rio was feeling all the benefits of being in a port town in Italy all of a sudden.</p>
<p>With her best friend tucked into her side as they strolled back up to the villa she couldn’t help but feel lighter than she had that morning, more at peace.</p>
<p>The doom that had settled with her hangover had disappeared entirely. And once again she was just a person on vacation with her best friend, a pretty interloper, and her best friend’s crush.</p>
<p>Not a bad place to be.</p>
<p>By the time they arrived back to the villa it was early evening but the sun was still hot, still beating down on the bay and the hills that surrounded it where the villa was perched.</p>
<p>Rio walked with Alice through the open planned living space and out onto the deck to find Jennifer and Agatha both sitting on sun loungers; Agatha was in the sun lounger she’d been in earlier and Jen was now occupying Rio’s.</p>
<p>They were both drinking aperols and both looked up when Alice and Rio circled round to them. Alice perched on the end of Jen’s bed and kissed her shoulder sweetly whereas Rio remained standing.</p>
<p>“There you are,” Jen announced loudly, pulling Alice closer to her, “running off with stolen sandals? Are you having a breakdown or something?”</p>
<p>“I just needed some air,” Rio said with a shrug, still too on her high to be brought down by Jen’s remarks.</p>
<p>“Yeah because a hillside pool is completely devoid of any air whatsoever.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes but noticed Agatha moving her legs up to cross beneath herself where she sat and she took it as an invitation to sit on the very end of the bed.</p>
<p>“Go off in search of your beach friend?” She asked as Rio placed her hands behind her and leant back, closing her eyes as she looked up to the sun.</p>
<p>“No, I tend not to return once I’ve had my fun.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” Alice said quickly, slapping Rio’s leg and making her look back across at her, “Who? What did you do on a beach?”</p>
<p>“Apparently made out with <em>Alessia</em>,” Agatha drawled, and Rio turned to see her watching her closely, a glint of amusement in her eye. She knew she was punishing her for running away earlier.</p>
<p>“Alessia?” Alice asked with a frown, “Who is she?”</p>
<p>In all honesty, Rio hadn’t remember the girl’s name until Agatha had just said it and she bit down on her lip as she returned her gaze back to Alice, wondering whether to be fully honest or to deny, deny, deny.</p>
<p>But it was too late.</p>
<p>“Some girl from a bar?” Alice filled in herself, shaking her head in disbelief. “And you took her to the beach? Rio.”</p>
<p>Rio sighed heavily and shot Agatha a look before she leant towards her best friend who was less her friend in that moment and more the woman she paid to look after her image, to source her jobs, to control the press around her.</p>
<p>“We were careful.”</p>
<p>“I doubt that.”</p>
<p>“Alice. It was just…”</p>
<p>“Rio, if you try for even a second to pretend you just made out with her I will drown you in this pool.”</p>
<p>Rio returned to chewing on her lip and ran a hand through her sun-dried hair that was a little more wavy than usual, a little more wild for the chlorine and the salt water.</p>
<p>“You did <em>not</em> have sex on the beach,” Jennifer suddenly piped up, watching Rio with wide eyes and a mixture of disgust and awe. “You’re in the middle of a campaign.”</p>
<p>Rio groaned and shook her head, “No one saw. It was dark and quiet and-…”</p>
<p>“You said you just made out,” Agatha said in a tone that sounded oddly accusatory and Rio turned to look at her, feeling strangely worse that Agatha now knew compared to Alice knowing.</p>
<p>“I-…”</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” Alice said suddenly, standing from her seat, “I need to talk to my client in private.”</p>
<p>“<em>Client?</em>” Rio gaped suddenly, staring up at Alice in shock, “Alice don’t be-…”</p>
<p>“Inside. <em>Now.</em>”</p>
<p>With that, Alice turned away and marched back towards the villa, leaving a shocked Rio staring after her with her mouth slightly agape.</p>
<p>“Holy shit that was hot,” Jen muttered almost to herself as she stared after Alice and Rio grimaced as she slowly went to follow her best friend back in, knowing she was already in for a world of hurt.</p>
<p>Once inside Alice grabbed her arm and marched her to their old shared bedroom, throwing Rio onto the end of the bed and beginning to pace.</p>
<p>“Not only could you have been <em>arrested</em>, what if the paps got a shot of you? What if some tourist got a photo of Rio Vidal fucking some local on a sun lounger?”</p>
<p>“They didn’t,” Rio said softly, feeling more than a little small, “no one saw.”</p>
<p>“And how do you know that?! How, Rio?!”</p>
<p>Rio took a deep breath and crossed her arms over her chest, trying to regulate her heart rate. “Alice, I promise you-…”</p>
<p>“No. You don’t get to do that. We have worked <em>so</em> hard to get you here. First Ralph and now… I swear if you’ve fucked it all up by fucking-…”</p>
<p>“It would be on the internet by now!” Rio shouted, throwing her arms out before her, “It would be everywhere! You’d have <em>seen</em> it. Alice, please, this isn’t-…”</p>
<p>“How could you have been so stupid? Honestly, Rio. You usually have more sense than this. What is wrong with you?”</p>
<p>Rio slammed her mouth shut, unable to tell Alice exactly what was going on for fear she’d laugh at her or she’d call her a moron, or any other insult she deserved.</p>
<p>But how could she tell her best friend that she was currently experiencing a true or maybe imagined flirtation with a married actress, a married older actress who had once pinned her against a toilet stall, a married older actress who had touched her in ways that weren’t strictly necessary when riding a jet ski with someone, a married older actress with a child, a married older actress who was probably not flirting at all with Rio, and Rio was going crazy with it.</p>
<p>“Rio. You need to-…”</p>
<p>But there was a knock on the door and Alice stopped, running her hands through her hair and pacing again, “What is it?”</p>
<p>Rio had expected Jen to be there to try and calm Alice down or else pull her into the other bedroom alone if her reaction to Alice’s outburst earlier had been anything to go by.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t Jen.</p>
<p>It was Agatha.</p>
<p>The door opened slowly and Agatha stepped inside, glancing between Alice and Rio and holding up two glasses of clear liquid.</p>
<p>Rio stared at her, unsure what she was seeing but she accepted the glass that was suddenly offered to her, Agatha now in front of her, watching her closely.</p>
<p>“Come down to the pool and take photos with me. Post them on your socials. If anything comes out about…” she cleared her throat and turned around to Alice to hold out the second glass to her, “if there’s anything about what happened last night it would have been on the internet already. But we’re here. People will want to see us here. They’ll be excited we’re together. Take some photos and make the most of it.”</p>
<p>Rio couldn’t believe what she was hearing.</p>
<p>Agatha, who had been so against any sort of pictures of the two of them on social media.</p>
<p>Agatha, who had denied and denied Alice’s requests to get snaps of them at dinner or by the pool or in the water.</p>
<p>Agatha, who was now looking at her with an expectant look in her eye, her hand motioning to the cool glass in Rio’s hand as if wondering why she hadn’t drunk it yet.</p>
<p>But Alice broke the silence first, clearly struggling with the same thing as Rio.</p>
<p>“But… but you were so against-…”</p>
<p>“I know,” Agatha said gruffly, glancing at Alice before turning back to Rio, “I’ve changed my mind.”</p>
<p>Rio opened and closed her mouth a few times, unable to form words for a while, but Alice had sprung into action before she managed to.</p>
<p>She’d leapt at Agatha and wrapped her free arm so suddenly around Agatha’s neck that the older woman stumbled back a little and in being so caught off guard she laughed and actually returned the embrace with a loose arm around Alice’s middle.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Alice said genuinely, pulling away to grin at Agatha and touching her cheek briefly, “This will…”</p>
<p>“You should speak to Jen first. She has to ‘okay’ everything but I’m happy if she is. Whatever you want.”</p>
<p>Rio couldn’t believe what she was hearing. She stared at Agatha as Alice made a soft noise of delight and disappeared from the room still clutching whatever liquid had been poured into the glass for her.</p>
<p>“It’s tequila,” Agatha clarified, motioning to Rio’s glass now they were alone together.</p>
<p>Rio dropped her gaze to it and hesitated for just a second before she raised it to her lips and downed it in one. It was a shot’s worth, maybe a shot and a half of crisp, clean tequila, which meant it went down as easily as any shot of pure alcohol could.</p>
<p>And when she was done she lowered the glass and watched as Agatha ran a hand through her hair and shuffled a little on the spot.</p>
<p>“What changed your mind?”</p>
<p>Agatha laughed a little and went to perch on the windowsill, curling her fingers around the edge of it as she watched Rio, “You looked so helpless back there I thought it was the least I could do.”</p>
<p>Rio chewed the inside of her cheek and dropped her eyes to her empty glass, watching as the last drop of clear liquid moved with each swirl of it.</p>
<p>Agatha was doing her another favour. She just didn’t know why.</p>
<p>“Photos of us will benefit me far more than they’ll benefit you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know… every other conversation I have now your name comes up.”</p>
<p>“It does?”</p>
<p>“Mmhm.”</p>
<p>Rio placed her glass down on the edge of the bed and stood to move over to Agatha, watching as her back straightened out and she looked cautious suddenly.</p>
<p>Rio gave her every opportunity to move away, to pull back, but when she didn’t her hand found purchase on Agatha’s cheek and she brushed her thumb delicately across her high cheekbone, a little frown forming on her face as she took Agatha in.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the two beers and the tequila talking, but she thought there was now a faint blush on Agatha’s cheeks where she still held her.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Agatha nodded gently, careful not to dislodge Rio’s hand and Rio watched in surprise as Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed and she raised her hand to hold Rio’s wrist lightly, her face turning a fraction of an inch so the corners of her lips grazed Rio’s palm.</p>
<p>It was so soft, so intimate that Rio forgot herself and moved closer, ducking her head slightly in order to press a kiss to Agatha’s other cheek.</p>
<p>But before she made contact, there was noise in the hall and Rio pulled back properly, her hand reluctantly dropping from Agatha as she turned to see who would be arriving now.</p>
<p>Just as Jen stepped into the room Agatha pushed herself off the ledge beside her and muttered: “don’t say anything”.</p>
<p>“Jen.”</p>
<p>“Agatha.”</p>
<p>Rio now took Agatha’s position on the window ledge, shrinking back a little from the furious looking woman in the doorway and noticing that Alice was just behind her.</p>
<p>“You can’t just offer-…”</p>
<p>“Come on, Rio is all anyone is talking about. It’ll be her or me and right now my money is on her. A couple vacation snaps and that’s it. You can have full creative control.”</p>
<p>Jen huffed and scowled over at Rio who was still hiding behind Agatha slightly, which, admittedly she wasn’t too proud of.</p>
<p>“Fine. Vidal, these pictures of you on the beach better not come out. Can’t have anyone thinking it was Agatha you were fucking.”</p>
<p>It was Rio’s turn to blush at this and she cleared her throat quietly as Agatha turned to her and offered her a hand, “Let’s get this over with.”</p>
<p>Rio blinked and momentarily forgot herself as everyone stared at her and Agatha actually wriggled her fingers at her. But she took her hand and found it to be just as warm and comforting as it had felt the previous night when she was off her face drunk.</p>
<p>They walked like that, unnecessarily hand in hand down to the pool area and Agatha only released her hand again when Jen pulled Agatha in the other direction.</p>
<p>“We’re getting one shot and that is <em>it</em>,” Jen announced firmly, “and we will only use it if I am happy with it. Goddamn Agatha Harkness does not hang about pools with nobody actors.”</p>
<p>“Hey,” Alice and Rio said quickly and even Agatha slapped Jen’s arm lightly. “Play nice.”</p>
<p>“Whatever,” Jen said in lieu of an apology and shot Alice a small smile over Agatha’s shoulder that promised she was at least half joking.</p>
<p>Whilst Jen worked on the composition of the shot, Alice turned to Rio and began fluffing up her hair, to what aim, Rio had no idea.</p>
<p>“You got a swimsuit on beneath that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah but isn’t that a bit much?”</p>
<p>“No, not when it’s your one shot to be across the internet with Agatha. Take it off.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes and crossed her arms over herself to seamlessly slip her t-shirt over her head and tossed it in the sun bed.</p>
<p>“These too,” Alice instructed, motioning to Rio’s shorts.</p>
<p>“Don't be ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“And don’t be a prude, Miss I Fucked A Stranger On The Beach.”</p>
<p>Rio huffed but supposed she deserved that and she shuffled out of her linen shorts, feeling a bit like an idiot just standing awkwardly in her bikini.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay!” Jen announced, having been strolling around the area with her phone and Agatha in tow as a test subject to check the light.</p>
<p>“Two options-…” but she stopped as she spotted what Rio was now wearing and rolled her eyes, “Really, Alice? This isn’t a porno.”</p>
<p>Rio looked down at herself, suddenly fearful she’d somehow stripped naked without meaning to. But she hadn’t. She was still very much covered up where it mattered.</p>
<p>“They’re by the pool, they’re friends, they’re on vacation. It would be weird for Agatha to be in a bathing suit and Rio to not be. Plus she looks more femme like this, it’ll help with the rumours.”</p>
<p>“What rumours?” Agatha asked suddenly, watching the scene from the glass barrier that separates the edge of the hills from the drop below it.</p>
<p>“Well two hot women on vacation together, one a lesbian?” Alice asked with raised brows and Rio had to look away for fear she was blushing too much at the insinuation.</p>
<p>“Agatha is happily married,” Jen accused with a frown and Rio was beginning to wonder if ‘happily married’ were tattooed somewhere on Agatha’s body.</p>
<p>“I know,” Alice agreed with a slight frustration in her tone, “everyone knows. So Rio not rocking up looking like a total-…”</p>
<p>“Don’t say it,” Rio interjected with a frown, slapping Alice’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“-… well, it’ll help the cause.”</p>
<p>Alice had clearly won the battle and had turned to Rio to take her arm and whisper in her ear, “Sorry. I just want you in that bikini for the shot. You look hot.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes and poked Alice in the ribs before she moved over to where Agatha and Jen were and offered herself up with a little display of opening her arms to Jennifer, “Where do you want me?”</p>
<p>Jen got to work immediately and had no qualms about moving Rio without asking if it were okay she touch her. It felt a lot like being in a set or in a makeup trailer and so Rio didn’t mind.</p>
<p>But things changed when Jen started moving Agatha and it was Agatha who was touching her now, rather than Jen.</p>
<p>Jen had positioned Rio to be leaning her elbows back against the top of the glass barrier, her right leg up and bent so her foot was back on it.</p>
<p>She’d forced Rio to face forward and her hair to drape across her shoulders, spending time in adjusting it until she was satisfied.</p>
<p>And then Agatha.</p>
<p>Agatha was positioned next to Rio, facing her.</p>
<p>Jen had made her place her right elbow on the barrier and her left hand on Rio’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Agatha’s hand was warm and Rio glanced to the side to see that she was watching her, her steely blue gaze intense in the early evening sun.</p>
<p>It was the golden hour and behind Agatha’s head was a halo of light. She looked breathtaking and Rio was glad she had the barrier behind her to hold her up, to keep her from melting before her.</p>
<p>“No,” Alice was saying suddenly, holding her own phone up to look through the camera.</p>
<p>“The hand on Rio’s shoulder looks weird. Agatha, put it on her stomach.”</p>
<p>“My stomach?” Rio asked in panic, breaking her pose and standing up properly, “Why my stomach?”</p>
<p>“It’s just less awkward than your shoulder. These needs to just look like two friends shooting the shit together by their ridiculous pool,” Alice shouted back across the pool, frowning at the dramatic reaction of her friend.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” Jen agreed, “makes it easier to see her ring too.”</p>
<p>Rio blanched a little and slowly settled back into position, glancing at Agatha as Jen continued to fluff her hair behind her and Agatha asked: “This okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” Rio said quickly, properly blushing now she’d caused such a fuss and turning away again. “Totally fine.”</p>
<p>She tensed as Agatha moved her hand down to rest against her stomach, and glanced askance at Agatha again, seeing that she was looking down at where her hand pale hand was now resting against Rio’s tanned skin.</p>
<p>Rio cleared her throat quietly and forced herself to relax, feeling the slight movements of Agatha’s fingers as she tried to find the most natural pose on Rio’s flat abs.</p>
<p>Not unused to being touched during photoshoots, and not even unfamiliar with posing with Agatha now for photos, this shouldn’t have felt odd.</p>
<p>And after yesterday, with Agatha’s hands all over her torso, this should have felt natural.</p>
<p>But Rio’s body was screaming at her that Agatha Harkness was touching her publicly, for millions of people to see, and when Jen pushed Agatha a couple inches towards her she shifted uncomfortably so that Agatha dropped her hand from her.</p>
<p>“Shoulder’s fine,” she muttered quietly and went to place her hand back there before Rio grabbed it suddenly and placed it back just below her sternum, over where her diaphragm would be.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” Rio reassured just as softly, keeping her hand over Agatha’s until she was sure she wouldn’t pull away.</p>
<p>Agatha only nodded once and kept her hand still against Rio’s skin.</p>
<p>Jen eventually moved away and went to stand by Alice to take the shot. Both Agatha and Rio tried smiling, tried smiling at each other, but neither Jen nor Alice were happy and both frequently pointed out the sun going in and the golden hour coming to a close.</p>
<p>“More energy! Look like you like each other!”</p>
<p>Rio laughed a little and shot Agatha a smile, raising a brow, “Nothing says ‘I like you’ more than a fake photoshoot on vacation.”</p>
<p>Agatha only rolled her eyes and moved the hand that wasn’t still over Rio’s stomach to poke Rio in the ribs suddenly, expertly finding her most sensitive point and causing Rio to burst out a laugh and lurch forwards.</p>
<p>Agatha laughed with her and caught Rio’s back as she threw herself back again, the shock of the jab making her forget she was on the precipice of a cliff with a thin, single pane of glass protecting her from here and infinity.</p>
<p>“Careful!”</p>
<p>Rio curled her arms around the arm that held her steady and caught her breath back steadily, not realising that Agatha had pressed against her side and now was basically just holding her where they stood.</p>
<p>“We got it,” Jen sang as the two women at the edge of the pool turned to smile at the other, suddenly both shy in their hold but neither pulling away.</p>
<p>It was Rio who broke the spell, peeling herself from Agatha gingerly, and feeling suddenly cool in the warm air without Agatha close by.</p>
<p>But she shook it off, forced herself to focus as she went to look over Alice’s shoulder at the photo they’d chosen of the hundreds they’d taken.</p>
<p>Rio was on the way to lurching forwards, her mouth open in a laugh and her eyes wide with surprise.</p>
<p>Agatha’s hand remained pride of place on her front and her right hand was close by her ribs where she’d just delivered the fatal blow.</p>
<p>Agatha looked pleased with herself, smug and beautiful in the light.</p>
<p>They looked good together, even Rio could see that. And perhaps Agatha could too because she’d appeared at her side and had briefly squeezed Rio’s hand where they stood, both silently acknowledging what was clear in the photo: Agatha Harkness and Rio Vidal were about to break the internet.</p>
<p>“Ring still obvious,” Jen said slowly, scrutinising every inch of the photo and now literally zooming in to see every inch of the two of them up close.</p>
<p>“Can we not zoom in on my breasts, please?” Agatha asked with more than a little annoyance as Jen focused in on her client’s body and ignored everything about Rio.</p>
<p>“Hey, check Rio over too. No nips slipping. No drool.”</p>
<p>“Drool? Rude.”</p>
<p>Agatha laughed beside her and Rio scowled, but looked back down again in time to see a zoomed in shot of Agatha’s face. She looked unreal. How could she look that good in a candid shot? But she looked up again and saw Agatha watching her closely and she raised her brows as she said: “You look good.”</p>
<p>Agatha fought a smirk and raised a brow at this, tilting her head as she surveyed Rio. “And you… are surprisingly shy about being touched when you fucked a girl on the beach.”</p>
<p>“Ooooohh,” Alice sang in amusement, looking between Agatha and Rio, all anger from the incident before clearly gone now she’d secured her client the photo of the century.</p>
<p>Rio narrowed her gaze at Agatha but saw no malice reflected back at her and only a smug smile on that annoyingly gorgeous face.</p>
<p>It infuriated her.</p>
<p>“Did Agatha Harkness just say ‘fuck’?” She asked with a smirk, and watched as Agatha narrowed her gaze further.</p>
<p>“Agatha, maybe you should start wearing your engagement ring,” Jen was saying, her phone zoomed back in on the hand over Rio’s stomach. “More sparkle.”</p>
<p>But Rio had turned around to be closer to Agatha and the older woman looked suddenly nervous, and a little surprised at the proximity again, but Rio didn’t leave her guessing for long.</p>
<p>In one, quick, strong, movement, she’d pushed Agatha into the deep end of the pool.</p>
<p>Two gasps rang out behind her and Rio laughed as Agatha resurfaced looking livid, throwing her wild her back over her head and practically growling at Rio on the edge of the pool.</p>
<p>“Rio! What the fuck!” Jen bellowed, as Alice slapped her hand over her mouth from beside her.</p>
<p>“Rio, what the fuck?”</p>
<p>Rio crouched down to get closer as Agatha moved towards the edge of the pool, ignoring the two behind her. “Sorry, I must have slipped.”</p>
<p>“You’re an ass,” Agatha accused just as she reached up and tugged Rio into the pool with her, both disappearing beneath the water for a few seconds before resurfacing with splutters of laughter.</p>
<p>It was the laughter that softened the reaction of the two people hired to be what they were both silently considering in that moment to be glorified babysitters to the two actresses now gasping for air and laughing in the water below them.</p>
<p>“She has an Oscar,” Jen said in disbelief as she watched her client throw a splash of water in Rio’s direction.</p>
<p>Alice only rolled her eyes and she took Jen’s hand, tugging her away to the kitchen, “Shame she’s straight. Think of what we could do together if <em>they</em> were together.”</p>
<p>“Rio wishes,” Jen muttered as the two disappeared into the villa.</p>
<p>In the pool Rio was laughing so hard she had to swim to the side and support herself with one hand, trying to catch her breath.</p>
<p>“God. You weren’t supposed to pull me in!”</p>
<p>Agatha was treading water somewhere behind her and laughed, “Like I wouldn’t. You think I’d let you get away with trying to drown me? I have an Oscar!”</p>
<p>Rio laughed harder again and turned, twisting her wrist to keep herself up still on the side. “Yes, I’ve heard! Where is it? The bathroom? The bedroom?”</p>
<p>She wriggled her brows suggestively and Agatha scoffed and threw a wave of water Rio’s way.</p>
<p>“The <em>office</em>. My office.”</p>
<p>“No fun,” Rio accused with a grin reaching her other hand behind her to hold the wall too.</p>
<p>“And exactly why would an Oscar be fun in the bedroom?”</p>
<p>Rio shrugged a little, smiling still, “Remind your husband how powerful you are. Remind <em>yourself</em>.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need reminding,” Agatha said with a grin, moving over to mimic Rio’s hold on the wall.</p>
<p>“Maybe. Still. Something sexy about it.”</p>
<p>“Well maybe you can put yours in your bedroom.”</p>
<p>“Mmm, I think I have a while yet. This one’s yours.”</p>
<p>Agatha hummed softly and pushed off the wall again, choosing to tread water in front of Rio instead, “Don’t be so sure.”</p>
<p>Rio raised her brows, “Are you gonna vote for me?”</p>
<p>Agatha released a laugh and tilted her head back, exposing her neck to Rio which made her glance down at it and lose her train of thought for a second.</p>
<p>“How about this?” Agatha asked, catching Rio’s eye again with a smirk when she looked back across at her, “If I vote for you, and you win, you have to thank me first.”</p>
<p>Rio scoffed and rolled her eyes, “Easy. Wanda will be a little pissed but-…”</p>
<p>“No, Rio Vidal, <em>first</em>. Before god, before your parents, everyone. Not just ‘your fellow nominees’.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed and poked her tongue into the side of her cheek, watching as Agatha’s eyes twinkled with mischief and something else she couldn’t name.</p>
<p>“On the very slim chance that I’m nominated and <em>win</em>, then yes. I’ll thank you first. Before anyone. Which might be hard to explain to my mom.”</p>
<p>Agatha hummed and nodded, “Good. Then that’s one vote in your favour.”</p>
<p>“And what if you win?”</p>
<p>“What if I win?” Agatha asked with a grin, “<em>You</em> can’t vote. So if I win, you’ve done nothing to help me.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” Rio sang out, kicking her feet out gently before her and stretching her body out near the surface of the water. Agatha’s gaze dropped along the length of her and she moved to the side, now only a foot or so away.</p>
<p>“That photo of us was gold. That’ll help you. <em>And</em> it’ll help your profile with the younger audiences.”</p>
<p>“Younger audiences?” Agatha gaped at Rio, reaching to grab the side so she could rest her arms and legs that were working to keep her afloat. “You know I’m not <em>that</em> much older than you?”</p>
<p>Rio brought her body back in to be back against the wall.</p>
<p>“Older, though. Old enough for me to make you seem <em>very</em> cool for hanging out with me.”</p>
<p>“That is so-…”</p>
<p>“So what?” Rio teased, finally understanding what Alice had meant. Relaxing more around Agatha was the way to go, it was the way to make all of this much easier.</p>
<p>She wasn’t just a girl with a crush on a movie star.</p>
<p>She was a movie star with a crush on a movie star.</p>
<p>Two very different things.</p>
<p>“I’ll have you know,” Agatha moved closer, her hand slipping below the water and resting on Rio’s side applying enough pressure that Rio knew she wanted her to turn her way.</p>
<p>“I’m seven years older. I looked it up. Both millennials. That’s barely an age difference.”</p>
<p>“It is in Hollywood,” Rio said with a smile, intensely aware that Agatha’s hand was still on her side as she turned to her.  “You could play my mom in my next movie.”</p>
<p>Agatha’s jaw dropped and she froze for a second, and Rio thought she’d gone too far suddenly, the beer and tequila blurring the lines in her mind.</p>
<p>But Agatha’s reaction, her true reaction hadn’t hit yet and an apology was on the tip of her tongue before Agatha repeated her move from earlier and found that soft spot between Rio’s ribs and waist and dug her fingers in so deep that Rio inhaled in shock as she folded in on herself.</p>
<p>She swallowed a mouthful of water and disappeared below the water line, dragging Agatha with her where she’d placed her forward-leaning body weight over her arm.</p>
<p>They wrestled and flailed beneath the water for a while until they both broke out, Rio coughing much more than Agatha and Agatha gasping as she struggled to keep them both afloat.</p>
<p>She managed to manhandle Rio to the edge of the pool, lifting her so her top half was out and her elbows could rest on the edge. Agatha panted softly behind her, one arm tight around Rio’s waist and her other holding herself at the wall by Rio’s side.</p>
<p>“That…” Rio gasped, too intent on catching her breath to focus on the fact that Agatha’s body was pressed behind her, her cheek and soft breaths against her naked back. “Was… mean.”</p>
<p>Agatha laughed quietly and pulled her head away, pushing off a little only when she was sure Rio wouldn’t collapse back into the water.</p>
<p>Her hold around her middle loosened enough for Rio to be able to turn around and found herself trapped between Agatha’s arms holding the wall beside her head.</p>
<p>It was familiar, too familiar, only this time Rio wasn’t as drunk, wasn’t as awestruck, though she was close.</p>
<p>“You okay?” Agatha asked softly, the laughter fading from her lips as she watched Rio watch her.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rio said just as softly, her lungs still burning from the inhalation of pool water but her whole body more interested in the woman before her than its own salvation.</p>
<p>“You play dirty,” Rio accused and Agatha’s lips twitched slightly at the sides.</p>
<p>“Not bad for an old woman, huh?”</p>
<p>But Rio couldn’t give in to this blatant cheating and only scowled playfully, taking a shot and lifting her right hand to rest over Agatha’s left on the wall behind her, her wrist twisted uncomfortably. Just to be closer.</p>
<p>Just to see.</p>
<p>Agatha glanced at their hands and saw the extra strain Rio was putting herself under so pulled her hand away and dipped it below the water, her lower face slipping under until she got a good purchase, to tug at Rio’s thigh, her hand slipping to hold the back of her knee.</p>
<p>“Here. I’ll hold us.”</p>
<p>Rio only nodded and as loosely as she could she draped her legs around Agatha’s waist, careful not to press too close, moving her hands to rest lightly and demurely on her shoulders.</p>
<p>Being held up by Agatha in the pool was not how shed envisioned her evening going.</p>
<p>But her fingers had moved of their own accord, lightly toying with the straps of Agatha’s swimsuit. Her thighs were tense where she tried to get a hold of her own desire to press closer, and her gaze was determinedly focused on Agatha’s.</p>
<p>They were both silent for a time and Rio began to feel the awkwardness of the choice, her mind working overtime to establish it as friendly rather than flirty.</p>
<p>If Alice had done this, if Wanda or any other her other industry friends had done this, it wouldn’t have meant anything at all.</p>
<p>But something about Agatha’s frequent shifts in intensity, the way she was looking at her, the way Rio’s body reacted to her, it was different.</p>
<p>And she wasn’t sure Agatha would be comfortable with a photo of them like this on the internet, but she could count several other of her friends who wouldn’t mind at all.</p>
<p>She racked her brain with what to say, how to break the tension.</p>
<p>She couldn’t run away again, that at least wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>But what could she say that would make this seem normal, natural, and not result in Rio embarrassing herself once more in front of Agatha Harkness.</p>
<p>“Nicky,” she tried suddenly, “do you miss him?”</p>
<p>Agatha looked a little taken aback by this, she’d clearly been lost in her own thoughts too but she nodded and frowned a little, falling easily back into the conversation.</p>
<p>“All the time.”</p>
<p>And Rio shifted her hands, jumping them from Agatha’s shoulders to her neck, her fingers just touching the soft, wet hairs at the back of her neck.</p>
<p>Agatha didn’t acknowledge the move but her arms flexed and she pulled a little closer to the edge, and Rio had to assume it was to lessen the strain as she held them both above the water line.</p>
<p>But it meant that she’d pressed closer.</p>
<p>Rio swallowed and cleared her throat quietly, “Jen told Alice he was a good kid.”</p>
<p>Agatha smiled just a little and whether real or imaginary Rio noticed her whole face softening.</p>
<p>“He’s the best. He’s shy but a real ham when he wants to be.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah?” Rio laughed a little as she felt the tension ease somewhat.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Into everything. Basketball’s his first love though. Tries to get me to play all the time but-…”</p>
<p>“I’d play with him.”</p>
<p>The words came out before she could even think about it and Agatha looked taken aback again for a second before she schooled her face and simply raised her brows.</p>
<p>“You’d play basketball with my seven year old son?”</p>
<p>“I mean… he can’t be any worse than some of the guys down the park.”</p>
<p>This seemed to give Agatha even more pause and she tilted her head to the side as she surveyed Rio closely, “You play? In the park?”</p>
<p>“When I can. I used to have a team but… work makes that harder.”</p>
<p>Agatha nodded slowly, apparently thinking it over for a second, “Maybe we can set up a date? Schedules are crazy right now but… I wouldn’t mind introducing you to Nicky if you wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>Rio cursed herself for getting herself into this position, literally and figuratively, but Agatha was offering another olive branch and who was Rio to say no.</p>
<p>“I’d like that.”</p>
<p>Agatha smiled softly and Rio’s gaze dropped to it, her cheeks flushing once more at just how close she was to Agatha.</p>
<p>It made her feel insane, made her feel like she was drunk again, misunderstanding things once more.</p>
<p>But had Agatha leant in a little? Had she parted her lips?</p>
<p>“Agatha! Drinks on the terrace!”</p>
<p>The moment was broken and Agatha had pulled away so suddenly that Rio almost dropped below the waterline again.</p>
<p>Her saviour was once again Agatha, who’d caught her waist and kept her buoyant but released as soon as Rio managed to grasp the wall.</p>
<p>They looked at each other but neither said anything as Agatha moved away and swam back to the shallow end of the pool.</p>
<p>Rio sucked in a sharp breath, watching as Agatha climbed the shallow steps to get out.</p>
<p>This crush was crushing. Agatha would be the death of her. And not even an Oscar at the end of it could bring her back to life.</p>

<p>When Rio finally followed Agatha out of the pool, she was relieved to see that she’d left her alone to dry herself by the sunbeds.</p><p>She picked up the fluffy towel left for her and wrapped it tightly around her wet body, watching as Agatha retreated to the veranda where Alice and Jen now sat with their drinks before them.</p><p>She was sure she hadn’t imagined Agatha had leant in but then… surely not.</p><p>Deciding now wasn’t the time to dwell once again on her tragic crush on Agatha Harkness, she padded on over to join the group, taking the vacant seat beside Agatha.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her briefly as she reached for her spritz but said nothing that would indicate how close they’d just been in the pool, nothing that would suggest she thought they’d had a moment that was more than friendly.</p><p>“I think we should all quit and just move here,” Jen said with a smile, relaxed back in her seat and cradling her spritz in both hands.</p><p>“Learn italian, eat gelato everyday, spritzes every evening.”</p><p>“I could get onboard,’ Alice said with a smile, nudging Rio under the table with her foot, “Rio? Time to settle down?”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure we’d all kill each other after a week. Two days is enough.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio and raised her brows, “Sick of us already?”</p><p>“Some of you,” Rio smiled a little, taking a well-timed sip of her spritz as she watched Agatha smirk across at her.</p><p>Maybe they were just becoming friends, feeling each other out, seeing how the other ticked.</p><p>Rio could handle that.</p><p>She was an adult. She could handle an unrequited crush.</p><p>Besides, she thought idly as she took another sip of her drink through the metal straw, who didn’t want a friend who was nice to look at?</p><p>“Let’s hope we’re not preventing you from meeting any more signoras on the beach, Rio. Far be it for us to stop you,” Jen said with a smirk that made Rio turn to her with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>“Actually I’m pretty exhausted from last night so… I think I’ll just hang with you guys, if that’s alright with you?”</p><p>Agatha shifted in her seat beside her but Rio didn’t have a chance to look her way as Jen laughed and said: “How you get away with it, I don’t know.”</p><p>“I’m charming,” Rio grinned brightly, and Jen rolled her eyes but smiled across at her, softening a little.</p><p>“Just don’t be too charming, okay? We’re getting that Oscar.”</p><p>“Actually, about that…” Rio leant in slightly and Agatha realised what she was about to do and leant forward too, angling herself towards Rio and holding her arm.</p><p>“Rio Vidal, I swear to <em>god</em>.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and turned to Agatha in surprise, and Agatha narrowed her eyes at her which Rio took as a dare and she said what Agatha feared she was going to as she stared into narrowed blue eyes: “Agatha’s going to vote for me.”</p><p>“Jesus, Agatha. You <em>cannot</em> vote for the competition.”</p><p>“Technically,” Agatha drawled out, slowly turning away her narrowed glare at a grinning Rio to look at her best friend, “everyone’s the competition.”</p><p>“But <em>Rio</em> is the favourite. After you, of course. Which is why you vote for yourself.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha squeeze her bicep softly and she glanced at her, watching as she settled back into her seat and pulled her hand away, “Hey, I’m just helping the younger generation out.”</p><p>She knew that was a dig. A gentle prod at Rio for calling her old earlier.</p><p>She scoffed and fought the butterflies that fluttered in her stomach at the idea that she had an inside joke with Agatha. Ridiculous, she thought to herself.</p><p>“Younger gen-…?!” Jen started up suddenly, because if Rio were in a younger generation compared to Agatha then the same could be said for her and Alice.</p><p>And she didn’t like the insinuation.</p><p>“Baby,” Alice said and Rio’s brows shot up as she watched her friend practically paw at Jen’s arm to soothe her, “I think it’s hot you’re a little older.”</p><p>“I-…” Jen turned to Alice with a furious expression that she couldn’t keep up for longer than two seconds and soon shut her mouth, relaxing slowly back down again.</p><p>“Whatever. Not that much older.”</p><p>“Old enough,” Alice said with a wide smile that was so infectious even Rio picked it up when it wasn’t aimed at her.</p><p>She nudged Alice gently beneath the table, making her turn to her and catch her eye. She wanted to tell her how happy she was for her, but it would be too mawkish to say out loud. So she simply wriggled her brows and shot her a wink, knowing she’d understand what she was trying to say.</p><p>“How long have you guys known each other?” Agatha asked suddenly, watching the interaction between them with interest.</p><p>“College,” Rio said with a smile, “We were assigned each other as roommates. Alice fell in love with my mother’s cooking and I’ve been unable to shake her since.”</p><p>“Empanadas to die for, tostones you’d crawl over hot coals for,” Alice clarified with a smile, “But honestly she can turn her hand to anything. Shame Rio never picked up her skill.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m not bad.”</p><p>“Not great either.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and took a sip of her drink but almost choked on it when Agatha asked her next question: “Have you ever…?”</p><p>“God! No. No. Definitely-…” Rio began, spluttering a little.</p><p>“Ouch, Vidal,” Alice said in faux-offence, placing a hand over her heart, “Let a girl down easy.”</p><p>“Oh you’d rather die than touch me, you know it.”</p><p>“True. Something… gross about it. Makes me feel a bit sick.”</p><p>“Ah thanks.”</p><p>Jen scoffed and reached an arm over to pull Alice a bit closer in a display of possessiveness that Alice responded to with a smirk and Rio watched with a slight pang of jealousy.</p><p>No one was jealous over her.</p><p>But she fought it off, turning to Agatha who was watching this move closely too.</p><p>“No, we haven’t. Never was even a thought. I came out long before Alice anyway.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Yeah, I got caught making out with my girlfriend by my mom when I was around sixteen so have been out since then and Alice-…”</p><p>But Agatha interrupted, clearly more interested in Rio than in Alice’s story: “How did your mom take it?”</p><p>“Totally fine. She said she knew and to be honest I think she walked in on purpose to try to force me to tell her.”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little and Rio’s brow furrowed slightly as she thought she caught something wistful in her gaze, but it was gone as Alice spoke across from them.</p><p>“I didn’t come out until I was in my early twenties. Rio knew earlier, obviously. Coached me through a lot of it. Helped with all the feelings and… confusion and… yeah, just took me a little longer.”</p><p>“Not me,” Jen said with a grin, “Came out the womb gay as the day is long. My parents knew by the time I was about five, I think. Never touched a man in my life, thank god.”</p><p>“Me neither,” Alice grimaced and Rio laughed at her as she did.</p><p>“Have you?” Agatha asked softly, turning again to look at Rio when her laughter had died down. Rio just shrugged and took a sip of her drink before answering.</p><p>“Yeah. There was a time in college I was experimenting… I wanted to see if I could be with a man that way. The thought didn’t disgust me totally like it did Alice so I slept with a couple guys but it wasn’t for me.”</p><p>This was putting it lightly.</p><p>The first time Rio had slept with a man she’d taken three hot showers in quick succession to try to wash the memory away, horrified with his clammy touches and frequent grunts.</p><p>The second time had been different but mostly because Rio had been off her face drunk and so had the man. They’d had a very clumsy fumble and Rio had experienced for the first time what it was to be in a situation where she felt no sexual attraction whatsoever even with his fingers inside her.</p><p>She’d pushed him away after two thrusts and stumbled her way home to crawl into bed beside Alice, reeking of beer and Paco Rabanne.</p><p>“Have you ever been with a woman?” Alice asked innocently over at Agatha and Rio watched Agatha’s reaction curiously, seeing her posture change ever so slightly and her jaw flexing a little.</p><p>“No, not for me.”</p><p>Agatha was saved from expanding her answer by Jen who had interjected with an amused smirk in her best friend’s direction.</p><p>“Agatha’s only ever slept with two guys anyway.”</p><p>“What?” Alice asked suddenly, totally shocked by this delicious nugget of information.</p><p>“No way,” Rio added, unable to help herself as she stared wide-eyed across at Agatha. “But… but you look like <em>that</em>. How have you only slept with two people?”</p><p>Agatha huffed and ran a hand through her hair, avoiding Rio’s eye contact and instead focusing on Jen.</p><p>“Thank you for that, Jennifer.”</p><p>“You’re very welcome, Agatha.”</p><p>“I… had a high school boyfriend and then I met my husband. That’s all.”</p><p>Rio blinked owlishly at what she could see now of Agatha’s side profile and remained silent as she tried to process this idea.</p><p>Two men. Two lucky sons of bitches had been deemed worthy enough to bed Agatha.</p><p>In a strange way it made sense. Agatha was better than mere mortals, especially better than male mortals. So it was right that only two of them had ever been able to take her to bed.</p><p>But still, she couldn’t help but think what a waste it was.</p><p>And how she wouldn’t mind being the third lucky son of a bitch.</p><p>“Agatha’s mom,” Jen started again but Agatha was quicker this time, her tone much sharper than it had been when she was trying to prevent Rio from sharing her voting intentions.</p><p>“<em>Jen</em>.”</p><p>“What?” Jen asked with faux innocence, smiling widely across at Agatha, “I think most of the world knows already anyway. She’s one of the largest Republican Party donors there is.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and her gaze dropped to her spritz and Rio watched as she began spinning it with her straw, clearly unimpressed with where this conversation had gone.</p><p>She felt a little sorry for her but said nothing and turned to focus in on Jen who looked like she was gearing up to tell an exciting tale.</p><p>“Evanora basically kept Agatha on a leash until she was old enough to leave home. Still would like to keep that leash tight, in fact. A real piece of work, that woman.”</p><p>Agatha shifted and Rio looked back to her, watching as she placed her glass down and began spinning her wedding ring with her left thumb instead.</p><p>“She’s not exactly ever going to win mother of the year and well, Agatha married young because-…”</p><p>“Enough,” Agatha said just as sharply as before and Rio’s eyes darted across to Alice who had flinched at her words.</p><p>Jen sighed heavily, “I’m just explaining why you’re a massive loser who’s only slept with-…”</p><p>“Jen,” Rio said quickly before even Agatha could interject, “You’re being incredibly quiet about your sex life. So go ahead: how many notches on your broomstick?”</p><p>Jen narrowed her eyes at Rio at the insult but Rio didn’t care, she’d felt a strange flare up of protectiveness for the woman beside her and as Jen huffed a bit as she answered she felt Agatha shift her position to turn more to her and the gentle graze of her fingers against her towel-covered leg.</p><p>She was thanking her.</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly but kept her gaze on Jennifer.</p><p>“Admittedly, I don’t have <em>that</em> many stories to tell. But… I always did okay for myself.”</p><p>Rio nodded once, not interested enough to push for more details now she’d derailed the Agatha bashing. She settled back in her seat and took another sip of her drink.</p><p>Jen must have known the conversation had died because she didn’t say anything else for a while and the table descended into silence.</p><p>But soon Alice spoke: “Maybe we <em>would</em> all kill each other in a week.”</p><p>Rio laughed and placed her empty glass down on the table.</p><p>“I told you.”</p><p>She stood, pushing her chair back as she did.</p><p>“More aperols? Wine? Beer? Are we just going to order in a pizza or something?”</p><p>Alice nodded and held her own empty glass to Rio, “Wine is good for me.”</p><p>“Me too,” Jen said, but Rio noticed that she didn’t offer her glass up.</p><p>Agatha reached for it instead and stood with Rio, “I’ll help.”</p><p>Rio only nodded and scooped her own glass up before moving through to the kitchen to discard the old and take the new.</p><p>She crouched down at the wine fridge and began pulling out bottles, inspecting labels as she went.</p><p>Agatha was emptying out the finished aperol glasses in the sink and they sat in a companionable silence for a while as Rio continued to focus her efforts on picking the wine.</p><p>White and dry was her preferred choice but all the labels were in Italian so she had to rely on the hopes that Italian and Spanish weren’t <em>that</em> different.</p><p>“When you slept with those men,” Agatha asked suddenly, just as Rio had pulled out her fourth bottle to inspect. “What did it feel like?”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, halfway through translating <em>’vine piano fresco proveniente dalle verdi colline toscane’</em> in her own mind. She paused, making sure she’d heard Agatha right and then stood slowly, moving to close the door to the wine fridge as she moved closer, “What?”</p><p>“How did you know?”</p><p>Agatha had turned her head towards her where she stood at the sink but kept her body facing forwards, her fingers curled around the edge of the basin.</p><p>“I mean, it was pretty obvious,” Rio said with a smile, trying to break the tension a little. “If you’re attracted to someone… you just know.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed a little and she turned away again, reaching to lift each glass out to place upside down on the side. “Right.”</p><p>Rio chewed the inside of her cheek in thought for a second and decided to be bold.</p><p>She placed the bottle of wine down and reached for Agatha, turning her around to face her.</p><p>“I felt horrible when both of those men were touching me. It wasn’t something I had to think about. My body just told me.”</p><p>She’d placed her hands on Agatha’s arms, squeezing them gently and tilting her head as Agatha kept her gaze away, lost in her own mind despite Rio’s attempts to bring her back to the surface again.</p><p>“But hey,” Rio said, softening her tone slightly, “If this is about having not slept with many people… then you should know that actually I envy you for that.”</p><p><em>Your husband, more like</em>, Rio clarified in her head.</p><p>And Agatha looked around at her suddenly and Rio smiled a little where she saw confusion in her face.</p><p>“You get to go home every night to someone who loves you and… I’m still picking girls up in bars or matching with them on Raya.” Rio shrugged and cleared her throat quickly, finding that saying it out loud actually felt worse than keeping it in.</p><p>Suddenly where she’d been trying to reassure Agatha, she felt like she needed the reassurance.</p><p>She moved away, swiping the bottle back and ducking back down quickly to the wine fridge that she’d opened again and hidden her face inside of.</p><p>“Anyway.”</p><p>Agatha remained standing by the sink and Rio now regretted being so honest, exposing herself in that way.</p><p>Agatha had probably only asked because she couldn’t imagine a world where someone <em>wasn’t</em> attracted to her handsome Ken doll of a husband.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Rio jumped a little, Agatha’s voice soft and just behind her now, a warm hand resting on her arm where she was still riffling through the wine options to find the right one.</p><p>She turned back and saw that Agatha had moved to be kneeling down just beside her, and looked nervous, her gaze heavy with emotions Rio couldn’t decipher.</p><p>But the hand on her arm had moved to cradle her cheek and Rio found herself leaning into the touch just a little, unsure what she should say.</p><p>Agatha took a breath and then said in the softest tone Rio had ever heard from her as her thumb delicately caressed her cheekbone, “One day, you will meet the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with.”</p><p>She paused as Rio’s breath hitched and she felt her eyes suddenly sting with the promise of tears.</p><p>Agatha’s blue eyes darted cautiously over Rio’s face and she saw in them a tenderness that had become more common the more time she spent with her.</p><p>She wondered if this was the kind of privileged look Nicky and Ralph would get from her, safe in their home, living a life with Agatha unavailable to Rio.</p><p>“And she,” Agatha continued just as softly, “will be the luckiest woman alive.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a sharp breath and saw Agatha’s eyes fall to her lips.</p><p>From outside, Rio heard Jen ask what was taking so long but it was immaterial to her.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness was kneeling before her and looking at her with what Rio could only describe now as <em>aching</em> and she felt like she couldn’t breathe.</p><p><em>You</em>, she wanted to say as Agatha gently wiped her tear away with the pad of her thumb, <em>let it be you. I want it to be you.</em></p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed out, just as Agatha’s thumb continued its movements against her cheek, her blue eyes as glassy now as Rio’s must have been.</p><p>But there was movement over Agatha’s shoulder and Rio looked up to see Jen marching towards them. She pulled away suddenly, mortified that she would be caught kneeling down before Agatha and crying in front of a wine fridge.</p><p>She busied herself with grabbing another bottle of wine, not even bothering to check the label.</p><p>“What the fuck is taking so long? You squeezing the grapes yourselves?”</p><p>Rio heard Agatha huff and stand behind her. She shot Jen an unamused look and went to grab four fresh glasses.</p><p>“We were checking the labels, your highness. They’re all in Italian.”</p><p>“So?” Jen asked with raised brows, “Rio’s Spanish.”</p><p>“I’m not Spanish, I <em>speak</em> Spanish and they’re different languages,” Rio clarified quickly as she stood to shut the door, satisfied that she at least wouldn’t be crying again any time soon.</p><p>“Whatever, you know what I mean.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and avoided looking at Agatha as she went to grab a frozen wine sleeve from the freezer, slotting it on the bottle and taking the corkscrew with her as she followed the other two back out.</p><p>She placed the wine on the table and stood at the end of it, vaguely aware that Jen was now talking about Agatha’s next project. She could feel Agatha’s eyes on her but she didn’t look up and focused instead on getting the cork out and the wine poured.</p><p>When she was done, she made a quick excuse for herself and disappeared back into the house to hide in her bedroom for a few minutes under the pretence of changing out of her towel and damp bikini.</p><p>No one came to find her.</p><p>She allowed herself just ten minutes to collect herself, well aware that if she gave herself any longer that Alice might comes searching, or else, and absolute worst case scenario: Agatha would.</p><p>But she couldn’t dwell in her feelings either.</p><p>If she took the time to fully sit in them, to analyse and dissect them, she would be in for a world of trouble.</p><p>For now, a surface-level look at them would have to do.</p><p>She had the rest of the night and a plane ride back to get through still.</p><p>Rio had a crush. Agatha liked Rio. Rio sometimes thought Agatha might like like Rio. Agatha was happily married.</p><p>The math was simple. The people were not.</p><p>So she soon returned back to the little group and found them all to be at least halfway through their wines, where Rio’s sat untouched in front of her seat.</p><p>Agatha glanced up as she came through and Rio managed to send a small smile her way before she took her seat.</p><p>“I should change too,” Agatha said softly, disappearing off to the place Rio had just emerged from.</p><p>Alice shot Rio a quick ‘are you okay?’ look and Rio simply nodded with an easy smile. She had to just get through the next few hours and then she’d be fine.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t have a hold on her when she was back at work, back doing press, back in her normal life.</p><p>Everyone knew vacations were rife for confusing feelings and ill-fated romances that would mean nothing when you were back home.</p><p>That’s all this was.</p><p>Only Rio wasn’t getting any of the benefits that might come from an ill-fated romance because the subject of her infatuation was straight.</p><p>By the time Agatha was back at the table, Rio had managed to calm her racing heart and the conversation flowed as well as it had earlier.</p><p>But with conversation flowing so was alcohol and the little table in the little villa tucked away on the hillside of Positano’s infamous bay became rowdier.</p><p>“Would you just let me finish?” Jen was shouting across at Agatha, who had long since given up on sitting properly at the table and was now lounging back, her arms suddenly flung in the air.</p><p>“Go ahead,” she announced with aplomb. “Be my guest.”</p><p>Jen huffed and pulled the shawl Alice had fetched for her earlier tighter around her shoulders in the chill of the late evening. “<em>Agatha</em> would have won all <em>three</em> Oscars by now if she were just willing to play the game a little more.”</p><p>“I don’t need to play when I have the goods already.”</p><p>“Incorrect, Agatha! You only have <em>one</em> Oscar!”</p><p>Rio grimaced dramatically for the sake of Alice opposite her who was staring at her with wide eyes and she made her laugh which made both Jen and Agatha round on her immediately: “What?”</p><p>Alice flinched and looked to Rio for help where Rio just began to laugh.</p><p>Agatha huffed heavily, stealing her wine glass from the table before she leant back again, tucking her feet beneath herself.</p><p>“Calderu won because her movie was about the Holocaust so <em>obviously</em>. A nun saving kids from the gestapo? Who could compete?! Then-…”</p><p>But Jen had cut her off again and Rio, though she’d witnessed this dynamic since they’d all first met in Cannes, was starting to really enjoy it.</p><p>“Don’t give me that shit, Agatha. <em>You</em> pissed off the director’s branch because you-…”</p><p>“Because I called out a bad working environment and an abuse of power,” Agatha countered and Rio raised her brows at Jen, wondering how she’d work her way around this one.</p><p>But she didn’t. She just shrugged and turned her face away, taking a measured sip of her drink.</p><p>“Whatever.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and mirrored Jen’s movements, taking a large sip of her own drink.</p><p>“Need I remind you that <em>you</em> encouraged me to call out the behaviour?”</p><p>“I said whatever,” Jen muttered, clearly caught and clearly not interested in continuing this conversation.</p><p>“You told me to do it when it was just rumours and so I-…”</p><p>“Yes, yes, alright. I lost you the Oscar. Are you happy now?”</p><p>And to Rio, Agatha did look happy. She looked more than happy. She looked smug, incredibly so.</p><p>“Thrilled, thank you.”</p><p>“I think the win here is the behaviour being called out,” Rio said with more than a hint of amusement in her voice, and just to add to it, she stole Agatha’s wine glass from her hand and drank from it, there being no other wine left on the table.</p><p>“Obviously,” Agatha said with a scowl, turning to try and snatch her wine back.</p><p>Rio just held it away, holding her right arm out to the side so Agatha couldn’t get it without physically moving.</p><p>“You’re a child,” she accused and Rio beamed at her in response, amused at how Agatha could be so furious but still look so ridiculously hot.</p><p>“There’s no wine left. No queda vino.” She offered as an excuse.</p><p>“Give me my <em>wine</em>.”</p><p>Agatha looked serious and Rio only grinned still, raising her brows at the determination writ large across her features.</p><p>“Oh? This wine?”</p><p>“Rio Vidal. ¡Dámelo!”</p><p>Rio blinked and forgot the game suddenly so pulled the wine back around and held it between them, only remembering what she’d been trying to do when Agatha put her hand around the glass she still held, their fingers overlapping where Agatha’s dominate hand was her left and Rio’s her right.</p><p>“¿Tú hablas español?”</p><p>“Obviamente.”</p><p>Rio saw Agatha’s gaze drop down to their joined hands and blinked slowly, her brain taking a while to catch up to what was going on.</p><p>But Alice was their saviour.</p><p>“Holy shit. Have you seen how many likes we got? Rio this is more than the last two posts combined.”</p><p>Agatha looked up and raised her brows and released her hold on the wine glass so Rio could take it back.</p><p>She hesitated for a second before she placed it down before Agatha and leant her other hand up on the back of Agatha’s chair as she turned to Alice.</p><p>“How many?”</p><p>Alice was frowning down at what Rio guessed must be her Instagram page and Rio raised her brows expectantly, vaguely aware that as Jen leant across to look over Alice’s shoulder, Agatha was drinking what was left of the wine.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Jen said quietly, making Rio feel even more impatient that no one was answering.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha said softly, and Rio was aware suddenly that where she’d leant over to place her hand on Agatha’s chair, she was now closer to her.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hand on her leg.</p><p>“I think I just bought you another two million on your asking price with that post.”</p><p>Rio scoffed but turned to look at Agatha and found she couldn’t think of a witty retort. Agatha’s eyes were heavy, her gaze a little bleary, her hand still warm and soft against the skin of just above her knee.</p><p>“Rio. It’s almost a million.”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, tearing her gaze away from Agatha to look round at Alice, unsure she’d heard her correctly. “What?”</p><p>“Almost a million.”</p><p>“Give it to me.”</p><p>Rio scooched her chair closer and held her hand out to Alice.</p><p>She felt the loss immediately of Agatha’s hand as it fell from her leg.</p><p>But Alice had handed her phone over and suddenly Agatha was close again as she leant across and Rio stared wide-eyed at the image of her and Agatha from only four hours ago, and the little number below it that confirmed Alice’s announcement.</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything as she looked down at the screen and Rio felt incapacitated for a while, staring at the attention the photo was getting.</p><p>She slowly raised her gaze to look across at Alice who looked positively horrified at the numbers it was doing.</p><p>“I can’t believe it.”</p><p>“Why not?” Jen asked with a wave of her hand and a shrug, “You are so welcome, by the way. But don’t get used to it. That’s the last time you’re using Agatha like that.”</p><p>“Do you understand how good this could be for both of us?” Alice asked suddenly, stealing the phone back from Rio and holding it up to Jen’s face.</p><p>“Rio’s already a hit online and Agatha… well. She’s a hit everywhere but. But Rio could help.”</p><p>Rio sniggered and went to steal Agatha’s wine glass and frowned where she’d forgotten Agatha had finished her wine already.</p><p>“Too slow,” Agatha said with a grin and swiped her glass back.</p><p>“Rude.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and rolled her eyes but Rio caught a slight softening in them and she turned quickly, feeling the need to have a replacement for the wine that was now missing.</p><p>“I’m gonna,” she started as she stood up, “more drinks.”</p><p>“I’ll help!” Alice shouted quickly, standing up to follow Rio eagerly into the kitchen and taking her sleeve in her hand, “Rio. What the fuck. How did this happen? We’re in fucking Italy and I have a girlfriend and you have… an Agatha.”</p><p>Rio laughed and wished she indeed had “an Agatha.”</p><p>But she’d take what she could get for now.</p><p>And what she currently had was a very pretty, reasonably drunk, friend who liked to touch her leg and share her smiles with her.</p><p>That could be enough.</p><p>“Did we just become <em>famous</em>?” She asked with a grin, sticking her tongue between her teeth as she went to raid the bar.</p><p>Alice laughed happily and grabbed more glasses, narrowly avoiding smashing any of them as she did so.</p><p>“We should take vacations more often.”</p><p>“Shall we just move here? Stay here forever?”</p><p>“I’ll ask Jen.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rolled her eyes but the reminder of Jen being asked meant that Agatha would be asked too and… Agatha had Ralph. And a son.</p><p>She shook the feeling off.</p><p>Decided that there was nothing she could do so she’d just <em>have</em> to enjoy what she had access to currently.</p><p>They soon had made up the strongest gin and tonics known to man and sauntered back out with them, Rio adding a flourish as she delivered Agatha’s drink to her.</p><p>“M’lady.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but stroked down Rio’s arm as she went to take her seat beside her again.</p><p>Rio decided she liked drunk Agatha.</p><p>She touched her more than regular Agatha.</p><p>But Jen’s spluttering as she sipped the strongest G&amp;T in the world made Rio look to her with raised brows and Alice begin slapping her back helpfully.</p><p>“You okay, princess?”</p><p>Agatha laughed as Jen continued to cough, “Don’t… Call me… That.”</p><p>Rio hummed in amusement and then took a tentative sip of her own drink, sinking back down in her seat and grimacing a little at just how strong it was.</p><p>“Can’t handle it?” Agatha asked with an amused smile in her direction, having not yet touched her own drink.</p><p>“Oh, just taking my time, that’s all.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and raised two fingers to tap the underside of Rio’s glass, indicating she should keep drinking.</p><p>“You made it. You should drink it.”</p><p>“Are you trying to get me drunk?”</p><p>“Would I need to?”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond but found it suddenly dry and herself unable to form any coherent response.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was flirting with her.</p><p>No… Agatha Harkness was telling her she knew she had a crush. She was letting Rio know that she hadn’t acted her way out of this one.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>But Agatha’s fingers were still on the bottom of Rio’s glass and she pushed it up slowly, watching until Rio allowed it to hit her lips.</p><p>It was the sexiest thing that had ever happened to Rio.</p><p>Agatha’s chin was lifting slightly with the rising glass and her lips parted, her blue eyes never leaving Rio’s deep brown.</p><p>So Rio had no choice but to drink the lethal drink in one go, intent on keeping Agatha’s hypnotic blue eyes on her for as long as possible.</p><p>Alice whooped across the table and Jen frowned at the sight, shaking her head in disgust.</p><p>But Rio was showing off for her crush, and when she placed her now empty glass down she closed her eyes, focusing on not vomiting now that she’d achieved her goal.</p><p>But it had been worth it just to see Agatha looking at her like that.</p><p>The noise around her felt tinny all of a sudden, distant in a way that Rio couldn’t quite comprehend.</p><p>But then something came into focus that was loud, or at least loud to Rio’s ears.</p><p>A whisper close by, a hand on her upper thigh.</p><p>“Drink mine too and I’ll love you forever.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed open, unsure she’d heard correctly. Unsure she’d understood what she was being told.</p><p>But she couldn’t focus on the words because Agatha was close, so close she could see the little smattering of freckles across her cheeks, the green in her eyes again, and the way her lips parted in a teasing smile.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and watched as Agatha moved back to pass her her drink and she didn’t even think as she made to drink it down, just as she had her own.</p><p>“No, Rio, my god!” Jen shouted in horror as Alice cackled at her side.</p><p>But Agatha was smiling at her, tilting her head as she watched her and Rio had to do it. She had to just finish this glass, just put it down, just not spew it back up and Agatha would love her. Forever.</p><p>And she did. She placed it down harder than she meant to and she felt the gin repeat on her as she did.</p><p>But she held it together.</p><p>And she grinned lopsidedly at Agatha who was beaming back and laughing quietly, her whole body leaning towards Rio and both hands now on her thighs as she used her for balance and leant in to kiss her cheek.</p><p>The kiss was soft, more nose than lips as Agatha slipped slightly but Rio didn’t mind.</p><p>She’d take that kind of kiss from Agatha Harkness any day.</p><p>When Agatha leant back her hands were still on her legs and Rio felt hot below her gaze, but then again maybe it was the gin she’d just swallowed down.</p><p>“Rio Vidal, my hero.”</p><p>The words shot right down in between Rio’s thighs and she gaped a little stupidly up at Agatha, trying to focus in where her brain was trying not to make two of the most beautiful woman she’d ever seen.</p><p>But that was difficult with how drunk she felt.</p><p>Blue eyes flashed down to her parted lips and for a second Rio felt like throwing caution to the wind and closing the gap between them but Agatha had already pulled away and Rio was able to breathe again.</p><p>“More drinks!” Alice announced, waving her empty glass in the air where she sat, having clearly copied Rio in knocking back her own and Jen’s.</p><p>“Well considering I didn’t get mine, that would be nice,” Agatha said with a hint of a smirk and a wink in Rio’s direction.</p><p>Rio scowled playfully at her and poked her shoulder now she was sat oh so far away in her own chair.</p><p>“You told me to drink yours.”</p><p>“Well perhaps if you hadn’t made them so strong I wouldn’t have.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, still trying to figure out how Agatha’s brain worked.</p><p>She liked to tease her, she knew that much.</p><p>“Get it yourself.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped a little and suddenly Rio didn’t know if she were teasing or not as she smiled widely, her hand coming up to her chest in a dramatic movement.</p><p>“Moi? Little old me get my own drink?”</p><p>“You heard me.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and stood from her seat, offering a hand down to Rio unexpectedly. “You can at least come and help.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows but who was she to deny Agatha for a second time so she took her offered hand and followed her into the kitchen.</p><p>In the cool of the air conditioning she shivered slightly and went to rest against the counter as Agatha dropped her hand and moved about the place looking for superior alternatives to Rio’s lethal G&amp;Ts.</p><p>“I can’t believe I drank both of those.”</p><p>“I can’t believe you did either.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rocked her head back, staring up at the ceiling as she fought off the threatening spin of the room.</p><p>“You’re a bad influence.”</p><p>“And you are going to have an almighty hangover tomorrow,” Agatha accused, a little closer than she’d been before.</p><p>Rio tilted her head back and raised her brows at her, seeing that she had in fact moved closer, her hand now next to hers on the counter.</p><p>“Your fault.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and bit the corner of her lip, “You’re a fun drunk.”</p><p>“Fun?”</p><p>“Cute.”</p><p>Rio felt her already warm cheeks heat up slightly and she wondered idly if Agatha were doing this on purpose; doing everything in her power to get her to blush, or suddenly feel like jelly in front of her.</p><p>“So?” Rio asked quietly, trying to pick back up some of the bravado she’d had whilst drinking two drinks in quick succession to impress a girl.</p><p>“So what?” Agatha asked in amusement, her fingers reaching out to just brush across Rio’s nails.</p><p>“Do you love me forever now?”</p><p>Agatha’s brows raised in surprise and she stepped in, raising her free hand to cup Rio’s cheek as she said in a gentle voice, “Yes, Rio Vidal. I love you forever.”</p><p>Rio knew she was placating her, toying with the sensitive emotions of a drunk woman, but it felt nice to be held this way by Agatha, to have her looking at her like that, to hear her say her name, to hear her say she loved her.</p><p>But Agatha’s thumb brushed her cheek just once and then she pulled away, and Rio reacted before she could think, she grabbed the hand on the counter and she swung her other round to pull Agatha to her, catching her in a tight but one-armed hug.</p><p>“Sorry,” she mumbled into still slightly damp brown hair, “can’t just say that and move away.”</p><p>Agatha released a breathy laugh against her and she squeezed Rio’s hand before she released it and wrapped both her arms around her. “Okay.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes as Agatha squeezed her middle and she thought she imagined it for a second but Agatha had turned her head slightly and had nuzzled in by her ear.</p><p>Her stomach flipped for reasons other than the gin and she felt herself suck in a sharp breath, and the arms around her squeezed her before they loosened and Agatha pulled back slowly, holding Rio still where she leant away from her.</p><p>Blue eyes were still hooded from the alcohol and the long day spent in the sun and Rio moved her hand to hold Agatha’s cheek, watching her watch her with a slight furrow in her brow.</p><p>“I should,” Agatha breathed out, turning her head a little so her parted lips grazed the heel of Rio’s palm before she pulled away entirely and cleared her throat, “I should get you water.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only feel the loss of Agatha from her arms and the ache of something she couldn’t name in her chest.</p><p>But she turned away and leant back against the sink, focusing on the soft noises of a glass being taken from the cupboard, the door closing, Agatha moving over, the water running, the glass being filled.</p><p>Agatha pressed the glass to Rio’s arm and Rio opened her eyes slowly to take it, quickly drinking down the water to try to keep the queasiness at bay.</p><p>Agatha had moved away, fetching other drinks for the group and by the time Rio had finished her water and taken a few deep breaths, she felt a little more confident that she wouldn’t be tasting that gin again.</p><p>“I’m glad you’re here.”</p><p>If the words took Agatha by surprise they took Rio by surprise too.</p><p>She hadn’t planned on saying them.</p><p>But clearly drunk mouths speak sober truths.</p><p>Agatha paused where’d she’d been filling a glass with ice.</p><p>“You are?”</p><p>“Mmhm.</p><p>“Because we definitely gatecrashed and you didn’t look much like you wanted us here.”</p><p>Rio tried to fight her smile but lost. “I’m better when there’s a camera pointed at me.”</p><p>“What changed your mind?”</p><p>Rio shrugged and tried to act nonchalant as she ran a hand through her hair, “Maybe the gin?”</p><p>Agatha smirked and turned back around to continue making the drinks, “Well I’m using vodka now so let’s hope your opinion doesn’t change again.”</p><p>“Never.”</p><p>Agatha glanced over her shoulder and Rio sent a clumsy wink her way which made Agatha laugh.</p><p><em>Nailed it</em>, Rio thought, beginning to hum quietly where she waited patiently for the drinks to be made.</p><p>Soon enough Agatha was pressing one into her hand and smiling as she held her own up to cheers.</p><p>“To ruined vacations?”</p><p>“To thanking you first in my Oscar speech.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped to Agatha’s smirk and she was so distracted that she forgot to take a sip of her drink. It took Agatha nudging her glass gently with her hand for Rio to come back to herself again and raise the glass to her lips.</p><p>“Aren’t you supposed to be some hotshot lothario?”</p><p>“Hmm?” Rio asked softly, swallowing down a small mouthful of limey vodka soda. Even in her drunken state she knew she needed to slow down a little.</p><p>“I’m not sure you have any game.”</p><p>Rio could only laugh at this insult and raised her brows at Agatha, swaying a little when she leant in slightly, “Why’s that?”</p><p>“Just a lil goofy.”</p><p>“Goofy?!” Rio demanded with a look of faux shock but whatever she was planning on saying next was lost in her own mind as Jen appeared back in the villa.</p><p>“Why do you two take so damn long?”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, in spite of herself she smiled goofily over at Jennifer and Agatha laughed as she moved to pick up Jen’s drink from the side.</p><p>“Rio was just telling me how <em>pleased</em> she was that we are here.”</p><p>“Agatha was just insulting me,” Rio added with a playful glare at the back of Agatha’s head.</p><p>“Riiiiight,” Jen said slowly, accepting her drink from Agatha and watching the two other women closely. “Well the party’s outside so if you wouldn’t mind joining us?”</p><p>Rio only nodded and pushed herself off the counter to begin striding out to the terrace again, missing the look exchanged between Jen and Agatha. Jen looked confused and Agatha just smiled as she walked past, focusing on following Rio.</p><p>“You took aaaaages,” Alice sang as Rio arrived back at the table.</p><p>“Making drinks is hard work,” Rio shrugged as she sat down a little heavier than she meant to in her chair and took another small sip of her drink.</p><p>Jen and Agatha appeared only seconds later and Rio wondered when Agatha’s chair had moved so close to her own but she said nothing. She was only vaguely aware that where Agatha’s arm was on her own armrest and Rio’s hand was on hers, her fingers were now grazing Agatha’s warm forearm.</p><p>“I’m not sure I’m ready to get back to work again,” Rio said quietly as she cradled her cold drink to her chest, shivering slightly in the cool of the evening.</p><p>“Seems cruel to be so soon.”</p><p>“When do you leave for London?”</p><p>“Mm, Alice?”</p><p>“Day after tomorrow. Just enough time to,” she waved her hand vaguely, clearly the gin had hit her hard too, “y’know.”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and her fingers stretched until they curled around Agatha’s wrist, seeking the warmth.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move away.</p><p>“Call my mom and wash my clothes?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Alice said with a smile.</p><p>Rio hummed and closed her eyes as she relaxed more in her chair, her thumb now brushing idly over soft skin.</p><p>“Well,” Jen said, the most sober of all of them, “When we’re back I think we both need a detox cleanse. This is the most alcohol either of us have had in weeks. You’re bad influences.”</p><p>Rio only grinned, her eyes still closed and allowed Alice to take this one for the both of them: “It’s good to let loose a little.”</p><p>“Not as loose as Rio, though. Sex on a public beach?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes opened and she was suddenly aware of the place spinning around her, the only solid think she could grasp was Agatha’s arm beneath her hand.</p><p>“Hey, she was hot and I was horny. Nothing much to it.”</p><p>“That easy, huh?”</p><p>“When you look like this,” Rio turned to Agatha with a grin and crossed her eyes to make her laugh.</p><p>“Goofy,” Agatha confirmed and she moved her free hand over to run up Rio’s arm closest to her.</p><p>Rio only continued to grin at her, delighted with herself that Agatha was paying her any attention at all, let alone smiling back at her, let alone rubbing her forearm.</p><p>“Hey, hey,” Jen snapped her fingers across the table and both turned to look at her, “Tweedle dumb and tweedle drunk. You’re <em>both</em> goofy tonight. What’s happening?”</p><p>Rio laughed and leant forwards to place her drink down, groaning a little when the world lurched a little more around her.</p><p>“I should probably go to bed.”</p><p>“No, stay!” Alice demanded suddenly, leaning forwards to reach for Rio. “Stay, it’s our last night. Sleep it off tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and briefly closed her eyes, “No, I need sleep.”</p><p>If she’d been cognisant at all, she’d have felt the soft squeeze of her arm before Agatha released her but she missed it as she stood slowly and waved in the direction of the table before making a wobbly path up to her bed.</p><p>It was best to go earlier, she thought. The night had already been full of temptation, full of a promise that could never become reality.</p><p>And she felt herself slipping closer and closer to being sloppy drunk.</p><p>To maybe just pulling Agatha to her. To maybe risking it all for a woman who’d already told her she had no interest in women.</p><p>So leaving whilst she had at least a brain cell still firing was the best option.</p><p>Rio woke in the night because a sudden chill in the room made her shiver beneath the thin sheet of the bed.</p><p>She rubbed at her eyes and hissed as her exposed hand felt the cool air hit it.</p><p>“Did I wake you?”</p><p>The voice felt far away, not behind her where it should be in the bed, but in front of her. And Rio opened her eyes to blink into the dim-light of the early hours and saw Agatha silhouetted against the pale moonlight of the little balcony.</p><p>“No,” Rio said softly, “It’s just a bit cold.”</p><p>She saw Agatha nod and watched as she dropped the lit cigarette in her hand, stomping it out with her foot before she stepped back into the room.</p><p>“You can stay out, don’t worry.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha said quietly, turning to shut the windowed doors and drag the light curtain across them. “Bad habit.”</p><p>“I didn’t know you smoked,” Rio said with a yawn, curling in on herself a little more to protect from the chill.</p><p>“I don’t. Not often anyway.”</p><p>Agatha moved back around to the other side of the bed and Rio turned to watch her as she opened a drawer and pulled out a little bottle of pills.</p><p>“What’re those?”</p><p>“I,” Agatha began and paused as she looked down at the little bottle in her hand, “I don’t sleep well. Doctor says it’s chronic insomnia and I’ve been this way since I was a kid so… sometimes I just pop a pill and it helps. I’d had too much wine earlier so didn’t take one.”</p><p>“Hence the smoking,” Rio concluded softly, frowning where she saw goosebumps along Agatha’s arm where she still sat in the cold of the room, her top half not yet under the blankets.</p><p>“Get under the covers. It’s cold.”</p><p>Agatha did as she was told and turned on her side to look at Rio, frowning a little in the dim as Rio reached for the hand that curled around the little pill bottle.</p><p>“Agatha you could have frozen to death out there. You’re <em>freezing</em>.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” she said softly, and Rio huffed, shuffling closer.</p><p>Perhaps it was the wine and gin in her system still, perhaps it was the vague haze of a disturbed sleep that emboldened her to do it, maybe it was just because it was the last time she’d ever get the chance to, but she pried the pills from Agatha’s hand and leant over her to place them on the side.</p><p>“Turn around.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Turn.”</p><p>And Agatha did, turning back over onto her side, facing away from Rio in the same way she had the previous night when Rio had first shared this bed with her.</p><p>Only this time, Rio moved in behind her and draped an arm over her middle, aligning her body along Agatha’s to get as close as possible, in a selfless attempt to keep her warm and a selfish attempt to keep herself warm.</p><p>Their bodies fit together like two pieces of the same puzzle and Rio couldn’t help the flutter of need that settled low in her stomach.</p><p>It didn’t occur to her that this may not have been a welcome move until she’d done it.</p><p>And Agatha’s body had stiffened which made Rio regret her choice instantly.</p><p>But as if it had only been because it was a surprise, she soon felt her relaxing against her.</p><p>Rio smiled a little and turned her head slightly, keeping some semblance of distance between her face and the back of Agatha’s neck for fear she’d never want to leave this position if she didn’t.</p><p>But she turned into the pillow they now both shared and quietly breathed in the scent of Agatha that remained there, her arm flexing around her middle as she did.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Drunk on the feel of Agatha against her and the soft smell of her hair, Rio hummed a response instead of speaking it and felt Agatha turn slowly, careful not to jog Rio too much as she did.</p><p>“Turn over.”</p><p>Rio blinked her eyes open and despite the chill of the air around them she felt her cheeks heat up in a blush and she nodded quickly, mortified that she’d been dismissed.</p><p>She turned onto her other side quickly and began to shuffle her way up the bed, feeling the mattress beneath her move from warm to cold as she went.</p><p>But just as she reached her pillow and made to move further along, a hand caught around her middle and Agatha wrapped her arm fully around her waist, tucking her fingers beneath Rio’s right side and pulling her back.</p><p>“Not that far,” she heard Agatha chastise gently behind her and suddenly felt the press of Agatha’s body against her, but properly this time, Agatha’s hold on her much bolder than Rio had dared to be.</p><p>She adjusted herself to curl her legs a little inwards and felt Agatha slip down slightly to curl her own to mould herself to Rio, the arm that was now trapped between them slipping below the pillow to support their heads.</p><p>Rio, who had been on the verge of slipping back into sleep not seconds ago, suddenly now felt wide awake, too conscious of Agatha Harkness wrapped around her for any hope of sleep to creep back in.</p><p>She focused on keeping her breathing even, but found it difficult when she could feel Agatha’s soft breaths against the skin at the back of her neck.</p><p>She cautiously moved her right hand up below the pillow to seek Agatha’s hand and found when she lightly brushed her fingers that Agatha reached down to hold her right back.</p><p>Rio’s heart leapt in her chest and she felt Agatha squeeze her waist, making a move to press a little closer.</p><p>She kept quiet for just a few more seconds before she spoke again: “You didn’t take your pill.”</p><p>“That’s okay,” Agatha murmured quietly. “I think I’ll be okay tonight.”</p><p>Rio nodded cautiously, not wanting to disturb Agatha anymore, aware she’d been the one to take her pills away in the first place.</p><p>But Agatha was warm and her body was soft against her and as she allowed herself to focus on that, she soon found that sleep wasn’t lost to her either.</p><p>There was no room between them for guilt over Agatha’s untaken pills, or for logic to creep in that this wasn’t a rational thing to allow for a person trying to fight a crush.</p><p>But when Rio woke the next morning, she woke alone.</p><p>For the first few seconds between waking and sleeping she wasn’t sure if she’d dreamed Agatha holding her all night.</p><p>It had felt so real, so warm.</p><p>But there was no evidence Agatha had even been in the bed, let alone curled around Rio as she slept.</p><p>As she turned to survey the room, she saw that even the little bottle of pills were gone.</p><p>Maybe she had dreamt it.</p><p>But worse than Agatha not being there, though that was definitely a close second, was the dull throb of a headache.</p><p>It felt like half-hangover, half-something else. And Rio didn’t need to guess what that may be.</p><p>Just as she was peeling the sheets from her body, the door opened and Alice bolted in.</p><p>“Oh thank god, you’re awake. We don’t have long. The car will be here in thirty minutes.”</p><p>Rio made a noncommittal noise and yawned as she followed Alice back out to the other room where her suitcase still lived.</p><p>She sourced a t-shirt and light sweatpants and underwear and then disappeared into the en suite to shower and change.</p><p>By the time she was done, Alice was now frantic in her haste to get Rio down the stairs and ready by the door.</p><p>“Yes, yes. Coming, coming.”</p><p>The dull throb of her head was back and wasn’t helped as Rio heaved her heavy suitcase down the stairs, greeted by Jen and Agatha who were lounging on the couch and armchair respectively.</p><p>Rio made brief eye contact with Agatha and found her smiling at her which eased her waking nerves a little but Alice was on her again and soon Rio was back in a dark mood.</p><p>“On the way to the airport we need to discuss timings for flights to London.”</p><p>“God, Alice. Can’t I just take it easy?”</p><p>“You’ve taken it easy for two days. We agreed that. Now it’s work time again.”</p><p>Rio groaned but her retort was lost when she felt a hand suddenly brush her arm as Agatha moved beside her.</p><p>“Technically, it’s still vacation time. I say at least until we’re halfway over the atlantic.”</p><p>“Amen,” Jen chorused from the couch and Rio smirked across at Alice, who didn’t look thrilled about being outnumbered.</p><p>“Fine,” she said with a huff, before pointing at Rio firmly, “halfway over the Atlantic.”</p><p>Rio only hummed her agreement and Agatha pulled her hand away as Rio said a quick, “thank you.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>They looked at each other for a fraction longer than was strictly necessary and Rio felt the same warm comfort she’d felt the night before. But this time Agatha wasn’t even touching her.</p><p>Just as Rio was about to turn away, for fear she’d stare forever, Agatha raised her hand to touch her cheek, “Did you sleep okay?”</p><p>She looked concerned, as if totally unaware that Rio had potentially had the best sleep of her life the night before.</p><p>The grin that took over her face at the absurdity of the question made Agatha frown and step back a little and Rio realised she must have thought she was making fun of her.</p><p>But laughter had spilled out anyway and Agatha was turning away so Rio had to scramble to get her to turn back, reaching one hand to her wrist and tugging to get her to turn back.</p><p>“I’m laughing because,” she glanced around quickly, seeing the back of Alice’s head close to Jen’s now on the couch.</p><p>They weren’t listening. They didn’t care.</p><p>But she lowered her voice anyway.</p><p>“I slept great.”</p><p>Agatha still looked cautious but she nodded slowly, a frown still present on her features.</p><p>“Good. I was worried you wouldn’t.”</p><p>There was the dull pain in her head again, and Rio knew what it was now: it wasn’t just <em>about</em> Agatha.</p><p>It was about <em>leaving</em> Agatha.</p><p>Because this little fantasy that she’d been able to carve out for herself whilst here, it was suddenly everything.</p><p>She cleared her throat softly and squeezed Agatha’s wrist where she still held it.</p><p>“And you? Did you sleep at all?”</p><p>“Actually,” Agatha started but was interrupted by the sound of a knock at the villa door.</p><p>Rio pulled away suddenly, turning quickly before she could change her mind.</p><p>This had to be it. This had to be enough.</p><p>She’d had one night of feeling like Agatha might feel even a piece of what she felt for her, and that would have to continue to be enough.</p><p>They all went out to the Mercedes van that had arrived for them and Agatha slipped in first, clearly used to having someone else always take her bags for her because she didn’t even bother to offer the driver any help.</p><p>Jen did the same.</p><p>Rio and Alice just looked at each other, then helped heave the last of the bags into the trunk and went around to jump in the car.</p><p>Of the six seats available, obviously only two were occupied.</p><p>The issue was that one person sat in the very back of the car and the other sat in the front row.</p><p>Jen was in front.</p><p>Agatha in back.</p><p>And Rio knew where she’d have to sit to avoid the wrath of Jen. And Alice.</p><p>She clambered in quickly, not wanting to draw attention to it, and took her seat along the same row as Agatha, sliding the seat in front of her back down until it clipped in at the bottom.</p><p>Rio slid her sunglasses from her head and relaxed back into the comfortable leather seats, pressing a variety of buttons until she felt the seat warmer switch on and she could rest her head back, bracing herself for an hour and a half in close proximity with Agatha for the last time.</p><p>The car was mostly silent the whole way there, and it turned out that Rio’s concerns were unfounded.</p><p>She and Agatha hadn’t spoken, they hadn’t even touched.</p><p>The next contact Rio made with Agatha had been when she’d lifted her suitcase out and their hands had briefly met over the handle.</p><p>It was fleeting, but their eyes met and Rio thought she saw a sadness in Agatha’s eyes that hadn’t been there before.</p><p>But Alice was pushing her along, making sure Rio didn’t dawdle through security so they could board the plane on time.</p><p>Alice, as usual, had timed everything perfectly so that by the time they arrived at the gate they were already ready to board.</p><p>Rio moved on autopilot, always aware of where Agatha was in relation to her.</p><p>Two feet away.</p><p>Right beside her.</p><p>Behind her.</p><p>The window seat on the other side of the plane.</p><p>Her only means of distraction on the long flight back were the movies in the entertainment system.</p><p>But halfway through the flight, three glasses of red wine in, she lost all sense of where she was and the danger she’d be putting herself in by doing what she did.</p><p>She put on one of Agatha’s movies.</p><p>It was her Oscar-winning role. The story of a ex-concert pianist cutdown in her prime by a car accident that left her unable to play.</p><p>Rio had seen it more times than she could count.</p><p>But it was comforting to see Agatha’s face without worrying what she was thinking about, or how badly Rio could misread the way she was looking at her.</p><p>“Really?” A voice came from somewhere above her. “This one? Not Susan Sarandon flying off a cliff?”</p><p>Rio sat bolt upright when she realised who it was, and narrowly avoided sloshing her wine down her front.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said lamely, quickly reaching to switch the little tv off, ripping her headphones from her head, though the damage had already been done.</p><p>Agatha only smiled a little, her hand resting on the partition that separated Rio from the aisle beside her.</p><p>“I just came to tell you that Alice is now sitting with Jen which I think means you’re safe from work chat at least until we land.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio said distractedly, her blush now taking over her face.</p><p>She took a shot and glanced briefly up at Agatha, barely able to make eye contact, but saw that Agatha was smirking at the sight of Rio looking so mortified.</p><p>“Don’t say anything. It’s a good film.”</p><p>“I know. I won the Oscar for it.”</p><p>Agatha bit down on lower lip and surveyed Rio for a second before she reached in and down, flicking the little handle to let herself into Rio’s semi-private booth.</p><p>Rio had turned the seat into a bed and so pulled her legs up towards her so Agatha had space to sit and she did. It felt strangely awkward between them, despite the fact that they’d been curled around each other the whole of the previous night.</p><p>And where Rio must still look mortified, Agatha looked cautious again.</p><p>“I think when we land we’ll be met with a whole bunch of press so…” she trailed off and Rio realised that she was saying goodbye.</p><p>She cleared her throat quietly and only nodded in response, reaching her hand out for Agatha to take. And she did, and held it in both her own.</p><p>“I’ll see you at the awards shows?”</p><p>“I’ll be the one in the fancy dress looking for a way out of there.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and dropped her gaze to their hands, her face softening totally until her smile disappeared and Rio watched, mesmerised by the view.</p><p>Agatha had taken her hand and turned it over slowly in her own, holding Rio’s hand palm up. She held her fingers above it, as if replicating that kid’s game of sprinkling imaginary sand into someone’s palm to see if you could get them to feel it.</p><p>But there was nothing imaginary about how she spread her fingers slowly up until they slipped between Rio’s and she entwined them again, her thumb moving to brush gently along Rio’s.</p><p>The caress over her palm sent shivers down Rio’s spine and she was so focused on the thumb now brushing her skin that she almost missed Agatha’s words:</p><p>“I think I’ll miss you, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t looked back up yet and Rio was glad of it, for fear she might lose the nerve to say: “I know I’ll miss you.”</p><p>But she’d said it and Agatha looked up slowly, and when their eyes met Rio felt sick with it. Already at a loss for how to possibly get over not seeing Agatha every day.</p><p>But Agatha had a life to get back to. And a family.</p><p>And Rio had a life too.</p><p>They just didn’t belong in each other’s.</p><p>Agatha seemed to feel the same because she ducked her head and turned Rio’s hand over, pressing a swift kiss to the back of it before she stood just as swiftly, leaving Rio sitting all alone in her little cabin in the sky wondering how she could have been so stupid—because ‘happily married’ meant nothing when Agatha looked at her like that.</p>

<p>It was 3am.</p><p>Two hours before her alarm would be going off.</p><p>And her phone was buzzing gently on the side.</p><p><em>Alice.</em></p><p>It had to be. No one else was able to break through Rio’s Do Not Disturb settings.</p><p>She threw her arm out of the nest she’d created for herself in the middle of her bed, slapped her fingers down until she could just about grip the end of her phone and pulled it back into the safety and warmth of her nest.</p><p>“Alice. What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Have you seen it?”</p><p>“What time is it?”</p><p>“Just after seven, why? Oh shit.”</p><p>“Seven your time? You bitch.”</p><p>“I forgot. This is important. You’ll want to see it.”</p><p>Rio groaned loudly, louder than she would normally, if her publicist weren’t on the other end of the line having woken her up. She wanted her to feel guilty.</p><p>“I have to be up in two hours,” she complained, doing the quick math in her head.</p><p>“You’ll want to see this. I’ve sent it to you.”</p><p>Rio huffed again and with her free hand she rubbed her eyes, shuffling her tired body until she was sitting up against the headboard.</p><p>“Watch it. Then call me back, okay?”</p><p>“I hate you.”</p><p>“Love you too.”</p><p>Alice hung up then and Rio briefly considered going back to sleep but knew Alice would be a terror if she didn’t do as she was told.</p><p>She squinted in the semi-darkness of her swanky suite and unlocked her phone. It was almost insulting that her iPhone recognised her face when it was this scrunched up and exhausted, but that was a concern for another day.</p><p>She had multiple messages in her WhatsApp inbox, some from random group chats, others from friends reaching out to see how shooting was going.</p><p>A couple from her mom she needed to get back to, and even one from her dad, which meant she really needed to get back to her mom.</p><p>She wasn’t the best at responding when not busy but when she was shooting and spending her time either on set or in bed, she became almost unreachable.</p><p>She clicked into the chat she had with Alice and saw three messages from only five minutes ago sitting waiting:<br/>
‘Wake up!!!’</p><p>‘Watch this. Call me back’</p><p>And beneath those was a link to a YouTube video from W Magazine entitled: ‘Agatha Harkness says “happiness” is movies with her son | W Magazine’.</p><p>The video was 4:53 minutes long but Alice had sent it so it opened to a specific time and whilst an ad popped up for some random airline Rio took the opportunity to pull the heavy duvet closer around her, turning her phone to landscape so she could get a better view.</p><p>She hadn’t thought about Agatha properly in weeks now.</p><p>Only when congratulating herself on not thinking about her had she entered her mind. Or when Alice was talking about Jen. Which basically meant she’d thought about her all the time.</p><p>So she couldn’t help but feel a little titillated at the prospect of seeing her face properly again for the first time in a while. Even if it were in black and white on her phone.</p><p>Even if it were 3am.</p><p>The ad finished and the video loaded and Rio was wide awake all of a sudden, watching as a black and white version of Agatha Harkness looked down the barrel of the camera at her.</p><p>She was wearing minimal makeup, her hair wild and… was it unbrushed? Rio couldn’t imagine a world where Agatha would allow herself to be filmed looking unkempt so she assumed it was the stylist’s choice.</p><p>She wanted to buy that stylist a three martini lunch.</p><p>Either way, she watched as her hand moved up to scrunch it slightly and Agatha’s eyes darted down as the interviewer’s voice started up: “Who is your favourite actor?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched a little at the sides and Rio lost her breath as blue eyes moved back up to look at the camera: “Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Can you expand on that?”</p><p>“She’s this ball of charisma, this wild and untameable force.”</p><p>Rio felt her cheeks heat up and her grip tighten on her phone.</p><p>“But she’s so calm when she’s on screen, as if she’s totally at peace with herself and what she’s doing. She’s naturalistic in a way that,” Agatha’s brow furrowed a little and she dropped her gaze in a look that told Rio she was thinking carefully about her next words. “…I so respect and admire.”</p><p>She looked back up and there was a smile threatening her features.</p><p>“Would you like to work with her?”</p><p>Her brow quirked and her tongue darted out briefly to wet her lower lip.</p><p>“Without a doubt.”</p><p>The interviewer had moved on to another subject but Rio had suddenly gone deaf, a violent ringing had filled her ears and she simply stared at Agatha on her little screen, watching her respond without knowing what she was saying.</p><p>She shut it down quickly and called Alice back.</p><p>“What the fuck.”</p><p>“My phone started to blow up and before I could even see what was going on Jen called to tell me.”</p><p>“What the fuck, Alice. She didn’t tell Jen? Wasn’t Jen in the room?”</p><p>“You know how W works those interviews. No questions before taping, no publicists in the room. Just you and the interviewer.”</p><p>Alice was right. Rio had done her own version of this interview not a month prior.</p><p>She’d mostly answered questions about her childhood, her hobbies, her approach to roles, but she hadn’t been asked about her favourite actor.</p><p>“Agatha didn’t tell her?”</p><p>“No. She had no idea.”</p><p>“I… I can’t believe she said all that.”</p><p>“I told you being friends with her would help. I <em>told</em> you it would work in your favour.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said slowly, frowning down at the soft floral pattern of her high-thread count sheets. “Agatha wouldn’t just say me because we were on vacation together. She’s not a liar.”</p><p>“Give me this one win, Rio. Because that answer will secure you a lot of support from the actor’s arm of The Academy, I know it.”</p><p>Rio’s heart was still hammering in her chest, the last thing on her mind the reaction of other actors to this endorsement by the one and only Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“Have you spoken to her?”</p><p>“No. But Jen was pretty pissed. Obviously she wants Agatha to win so-…”</p><p>“Can you get me her number?”</p><p>“Jen?”</p><p>“No,” Rio paused, second-guessing asking. “Agatha’s.”</p><p>“Sure. I’ll get Jen to send it.”</p><p>Rio went silent for a second and found herself twirling her hair as she stared absently towards the curtain-covered windows, “You think she really meant it?”</p><p>Despite what she’d just said about knowing Agatha not to be a liar, not to just say things because she thought she should, she was suddenly second-guessing herself. It was a big thing to claim: that Rio was her favourite actress.</p><p>There were so many greats past and present she could have named, that were far better. Industry legends and people with nominations and wins that Rio didn’t have. And yet…</p><p>“Rio, babe. You are so good at what you do. I was kidding about the friendship thing. And you’re right… Agatha wouldn’t have said it if she didn’t mean it.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and closed her eyes, “I think I’m just tired.”</p><p>“Get another hour’s sleep and call me later. Remember I’ll be out in a couple days. You’ve press on Sunday so no partying. As much rest as possible.”</p><p>“Says the person who called me at 3am to wake me up to watch-…”</p><p>“And before I forget,” Alice interjected quickly, “your mom’s been on to me about getting you to get back to her.”</p><p>Rio laughed and shuffled back down the bed, “I’ll call today. Get her off your back.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“Call me later, okay?”</p><p>“Night, Alice.”</p><p>“Night, Rio.”</p><p>Rio hung up and looked back up at her phone she now held above her head where she lay, far too wired to get back to sleep. A freeze-frame of Agatha stared back at her and she wondered what possessed her to mention her name.</p><p>The interview must have happened recently. Her own interview with W was filmed one morning and released the next week.</p><p>So she’d been away on vacation with her and then, what? Suddenly decided Rio was a good actress? That couldn’t be right.</p><p>A little modal popped over the top of the screen and Rio saw that Alice had shared a contact with her. Nothing if not efficient.</p><p>She clicked into it, using her sleep-deprived brain to give her enough courage and she saved the number quickly before tapping out a message.</p><p>‘A wild and untameable force?’</p><p>She didn’t leave her name on the message, and mentally kicked herself for not doing so but double-texting was more embarrassing than just leaving it how it was so she clicked out of the message and jumped back to the interview.</p><p>She rewound it and watched Agatha answer the question again.</p><p>Just as she was focusing in on the way Agatha looked into the camera, and looked away when she was thinking, a message appeared again at the top of the screen.</p><p>3:17am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Who is this?</p><p>Rio sucked in a sharp breath and stared at the popup until it disappeared, debating whether or not it was a good idea to respond when she had to be ready for her pick up time in just over two hours and she’d barely had five hours’ sleep.</p><p>She lost the fight against her better angels.</p><p>3:18am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Your favorite actor.</p><p>If Agatha didn’t want to play ball, Rio knew she wouldn’t. She’d ignore the message or tell Rio she’d been taken by surprise and hers was the first name that popped into her head.</p><p>And that was fine. But Rio hoped she wouldn’t. She hoped she’d rise to the bait.</p><p>The thought of it sent a little jolt of thrill through her.</p><p>3:20am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Aren’t you on London time? Why are you watching my interviews at 3am?</p><p>3:21am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Alice woke me to tell me the news.</p><p>3:22am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: That I mentioned your name in an interview?</p><p>3:23am<br/>
Rio Vidal: She’s thorough.</p><p>3:24am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: So are you texting to thank me?</p><p>3:26am<br/>
Rio Vidal: I don’t know. Would that make you respect and admire me more?</p><p>3:27am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Don’t make me regret it.</p><p>3:28am<br/>
Rio Vidal: I think Alice is going to send you a thank you gift. Perhaps a selection of my movies for you to enjoy.</p><p>3:29am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Go to sleep, Rio.</p><p>3:30am<br/>
Rio Vidal: If it helps, you’re mine.</p><p>3:34am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Your what?</p><p>3:35am:<br/>
Rio Vidal: Favorite actor.</p><p>3:36am:<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Go to sleep.</p><p>Rio smiled a little at her phone, imagining Agatha’s expression as she stared at the three words of her last message. She sighed quietly and had to roll her eyes at herself for finding even the way she text to be attractive.</p><p>An ocean of distance, almost two months since Italy, and three timezones apart made absolutely no difference to her crush.</p><p>Knowing it wouldn’t help her case to keep bothering Agatha via text, she put her phone beside her on the pillow and curled back in on herself to try to force at least an hour’s worth of sleep.</p><p>She managed it, and slept soundly until the obnoxious sound of her alarm woke her to warn her she had thirty minutes before she’d be picked up.</p><p>In the scramble to shower and change, she’d forgotten about the interruption to her beauty sleep and only when she had a chance to check her messages in the back of the comfortable hired car did she remember.</p><p>Alice had thankfully left her alone between the hours of 3:30 and 5am. Only now was she messaging, knowing Rio would be fully awake and on her way to work.</p><p>5:32am<br/>
Alice WG: So many people want a comment about Agatha’s good taste!!!</p><p>5:33am<br/>
Alice WG: But think it’s much cooler if we ignore in any official capac. If any paps ask: say flattered, good friend, a huge fan, etc etc</p><p>5:33am<br/>
Alice WG: Get to set safe - call later x</p><p>Amongst all the other messages she was still to wade through, and Rio remembered with a stab of guilt she really did need to call her parents, there was another sitting in her inbox from Agatha.</p><p>4:59am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: When you’re back, perhaps you can thank me properly by coming good on your offer to play basketball with Nicky?</p><p>Rio stared at the message for a full five minutes, wondering how long Agatha had been thinking about sending it since her last message a full how and thirty minutes before.</p><p>But surely she’d not thought about it at all? Surely she’d just been thinking about her son or her son and basketball and randomly remembered that Rio, a few weeks ago, had offered to play basketball with him.</p><p>When they’d been in the pool together.</p><p>When Rio’s legs had been around her waist and when Rio had thought for a second, just a second, that Agatha may kiss her.</p><p>But it was too early to be second-guessing Agatha again.</p><p>She put her phone away and distracted herself by speaking to her driver, and used his chat to forget about the early morning surprise.</p><p>By the time she arrived on set, Rio was too busy to be able to think much more about Agatha’s suggestion. Though it fell into her mind every once in a while when things got quieter.</p><p>Being on set without Alice wasn’t her favourite place to be.</p><p>She had already made good friends with the cast and was friendly with almost all the crew too, but in her downtime where she could sit in her trailer for a while, she missed having her best friend around.</p><p>But setlife took over for a couple days and Agatha’s text sat unanswered in her inbox.</p><p>One evening she’d stayed out with two of her fellow cast members and had too much to drink for someone who had to be awake at 5am and know her lines the next day.</p><p>And in that precious time between falling into bed and falling asleep, she decided to talk to Alice about it.</p><p>She’d been struggling through like a pathetic loser pining after someone unattainable. She now knew she needed the help of her friend.</p><p>And so, halfway through the day on set the next day, when she arrived at her trailer for an hour’s turnaround where she could take a quick nap or call her parents (which she was still yet to do), she was delighted to find Alice already there and waiting for her.</p><p>“This place is a mess, Rio.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio said with a grin as she tackled Alice in a hug so hard she knocked them both down onto the couch.</p><p>Alice’s cackle filled the trailer and Rio felt at home in there for the first time since she’d arrived.</p><p>Still, Alice was shoving her off so she rolled away with a grin.</p><p>“Miss me much?”</p><p>“Like you wouldn’t believe.”</p><p>Alice laughed and her smile faded to something softer as she pulled her legs up beneath her and turned properly to her friend.</p><p>“You look tired.”</p><p>“I’m <em>exhausted</em>.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t happen to be because you were out until the early hours last night, would it?”</p><p>“Who told you?”</p><p>“I have my spies.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but had her suspicions that it was probably one of the younger actors who liked his gossip as much as he liked his coke.</p><p>“Fine. Maybe I was. I just needed to let off some steam.”</p><p>Alice nodded slowly and watched Rio for a second before asking, “Everything okay? Lily says everything’s great, your performance is outstanding and she’s really excited for the final cut.”</p><p>Rio nodded in acknowledgement, pleased her director wasn’t just blowing smoke up her ass every time she praised her performance on set. But she knew Alice was giving her an opening and so she took it.</p><p>“Actually, I want to run something by you. Something that… well something stupid. But I can’t shake. And I’m telling you as your <em>friend</em>, not as your client, okay? Be my friend with it.”</p><p>Alice raised her brows but shifted and placed a hand on Rio’s knee where it rested against the back of the couch, “You got it. What’s going on?”</p><p>“It’s so stupid,” Rio qualified, already finding it hard to voice the embarrassing thing that had such a hold on her for months now.</p><p>“That’s okay. I’ve seen and heard you do many stupid things. And you me.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and ran a hand through her hair. “I have a crush. A big, fat, inconvenient crush.”</p><p>“Rio, not on Lily. You can’t screw the director.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said with a small frown, “Agatha.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know how she’d expected Alice to react but laughter wasn’t it.</p><p>“Right, okay, and who doesn’t? Half the population is in love with her.”</p><p>“No, look… it’s hard to explain. I just…” Rio cleared her throat and pulled her knees to her chest, dislodging Alice’s hand. “I think about her a lot.”</p><p>“Okay,” Alice said slowly, looking at Rio closely and with a slight suspicion in her gaze, “You know she’s married, right? And like, has a son and everything? With a man?”</p><p>Rio huffed and rolled her eyes, “Yes, people keep telling me.”</p><p>Alice frowned and began chewing on her lip, “Okay… Jen mentioned something a while back about you being a big flirt when Agatha was around but… it’s just a crush, it’ll disappear.”</p><p>“That’s the thing, Alice. I don’t know. It’s been <em>weeks</em> since I’ve seen her and-…”</p><p>“Rio, is it just because you can’t have her?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Look, you’re a hot movie star. You can usually get whoever you want. And I mean <em>anyone</em> but Agatha… well she doesn’t want you and maybe that’s just it. You want her because you can’t have her.”</p><p>Rio blinked and for a second felt mortified, horrified that her friend had psychoanalysed her so mercilessly.</p><p>Maybe that was it. Maybe she was forbidden fruit and so every interaction she’d had with her Rio was reading into it, bolstering the fantasy.</p><p>Agatha didn’t want her. Rio wanted her because she didn’t want her.</p><p>She’d been wrong to read into the touches and smiles, Agatha simply found her amusing, knew she was flirting, and was secure enough to flirt a little back.</p><p>But then the was the way she kept close, the way she’d wrapped herself so securely around Rio that last night.</p><p>Because maybe Agatha was happily married but Rio was convinced she had even a slight curiosity about Rio. She knew she found her charming. She knew she touched her far more than she’d seen her touch Alice or even Jen.</p><p>But she couldn’t bring herself to vocalise all of this.</p><p>For one she’d be accusing a married straight woman of flirting with her which went against her general moral code and for another, perhaps she was wrong and Alice was right.</p><p>“Holy shit. That can’t be it, Alice. I’m… fuck, am I an asshole?”</p><p>Alice laughed, cracking the tension in the air immediately with the noise. “I mean… you’re not <em>not</em> an asshole.”</p><p>“God,” Rio put her head between her knees and groaned loudly, “all this time I thought I was going insane with it.”</p><p>Alice shuffled closer until her knees were just before Rio’s feet and she pushed at the top of her head to get her to look at her: “You need to get laid. When was the last time-… Oh. Is <em>this</em> why you went rogue and fucked some poor girl on the beach?”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes a little but didn’t have the strength to keep it up so flopped her head back down, “I was trying to get it out of my system.”</p><p>“Oh babe,” Alice laughed again, “Get over yourself. She doesn’t want you. I know it may be a shock to the system but just deal with it. Like the rest of us have to. Do you know how many times I’ve been left wanting?”</p><p>“Shut up, you do just fine. Besides, you have a hot girlfriend.”</p><p>“One I hardly ever see.”</p><p>“You’ve just flown back to LA for a week to be with her.”</p><p>“A week is barely any time at all. We were both still working.”</p><p>Rio just huffed a heavy breath and lifted her head slowly, reluctantly meeting Alice’s amused gaze, “You think that’s really it? I’m a dick?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m afraid so.”</p><p>“Did Jen really call out my flirting?”</p><p>“Yes. She said you may as well have crawled on top of her and stuck your tongue down her throat.”</p><p>Rio grimaced a little and had to fight the images that conjured in her mind.</p><p>“I wasn’t that bad.”</p><p>“I think she was just pissed that Agatha gave you that photo.”</p><p>Sighing softly, Rio fished her phone from her back pocket and clicked about until she turned it around to show Alice the texts from Agatha.</p><p>Alice read through them and raised her brows, “Please don’t tell me you’ve left Agatha Harkness on read for three days.”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>. Get a grip. Text her back. Say you’re sorry you’ve been busy but would <em>love</em> to teach her son basketball or whatever.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but stole her phone back and put it to the side, “I was overthinking it.”</p><p>“Clearly. Look, you’re both at the top of your game, you’re both used to getting what you want, you’re both hot. But think about it this way, if she were into you, it would never work out anyway. You’d have one hot night together and then it would be hell every time you saw her. At least this way you get to enjoy her pretty smiles and not worry about her icing you out of the industry.”</p><p>Rio hated to admit when Alice was right, but she was. At least about this part. And so Rio nodded and picked her phone back up to send the response that was three days overdue.</p><p>1:09pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Sorry, work has been manic. I’d love to. After Venice I have a week or so early September back in LA. Let me know time and date and I’ll be there.</p><p>She turned her phone back around to show Alice and her friend beamed at her before snatching her phone away to check her call log.</p><p>“You ass. Call your mother.”</p><p>Rio laughed and snatched her phone back, “Dick.”</p><p>Alice, despite her teasing of Rio the rest of the day about her disastrous crush - whenever she got a chance between filming - insisted Rio have an early night so she could rest up for the following day of no filming but press instead.</p><p>The production company had worked around Rio’s schedule so that she could do press for <em>All The Wrong Gods</em> as the awards machine continued to pick up momentum.</p><p>What that meant, though, was that a usual press day of anywhere between 6-8 hours was now a full 12.</p><p>Rio was back to back with journalists from practically the moment she woke up, doing call-ins to radio shows, sitting in hair and makeup whilst she spoke to journalists in the room with her, heading for lunch for publications doing longreads, and sitting in a small stuffy room answering the same questions again and again about a movie she’d made over a year ago.</p><p>Her only respite during this time was Alice who kept her morale up by feeding her snacks, making sure she had plenty of coffee, and plenty of moments to complain when out of earshot of everyone else.</p><p>It was just after lunch with a journalist from <em>The Times</em> when the response to her message to Agatha came through.</p><p>Her phone had vibrated in her pocket as she hugged the journalist goodbye and Rio had checked it as she waited for her driver for the day to pick her up and take her back to the hotel where she was to do more interviews.</p><p>2:17pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: 4pm, after Nicky finishes school, 2nd, 2270 La Granada Dr.</p><p>This time, Rio didn’t make her wait.</p><p>2:22pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Looking forward to it. :)</p><p>She regretted the smiley face.</p><p>She didn’t receive a text back.</p><p>But that was fine. She’d sucked up her pride and decided that she would have to get over herself in order to get over Agatha. And she had over a month to do just that.</p><p>But a month goes by surprisingly quickly when all you do is work and sleep.</p><p>Alice was Rio’s lifeline, as usual, during this time.</p><p>She made sure Rio kept cheery during her ‘off’ days when she had to squeeze in more interviews that she’d ever done in her life. She made sure Rio had the right amount of sleep and the right amount of alcohol in her system at least once every two weeks to blow off steam but not ruin the next day.</p><p>She even convinced Rio that sleeping with the DP was not a good idea, which turned out to be great advice because the DP in question had a boyfriend and the boyfriend just so happened to be the Assistant Editor.</p><p>And Rio coached Alice through her pining for Jen. She helped her analyse everything phone conversation they’d had, every text that looked apathetic or every selfie where there appeared to be a pretty woman in the background.</p><p>It felt a lot like college all over again, where they were each other’s bastions of strength and support.</p><p>But perhaps the best thing Alice managed to do for Rio was to remind her weekly to call her mom.</p><p>And once this pattern was established, a grateful Anna Vidal sent a care package to Alice’s hotel room full of Puerto Rican snacks and a postcard from Delaware thanking her for managing Rio so well.</p><p>Rio was <em>not</em> happy about this and as punishment stole as much of the package for herself as she could.</p><p>But after filming wrapped and both her and Alice got so drunk at the wrap party neither was sure how they ended up in Rio’s bed the next morning in one piece, they still had another film festival to go.</p><p>Venice was a means to an end. A chance to campaign a little more in the European market but mostly to get Rio on the best dressed lists and get her face out there as much as possible.</p><p>Schmoozing. Rio could do it better than anyone.</p><p>And the best thing about Venice was that Wanda would be there, which meant Rio would have an ally other than Alice and someone else to complain to when it all got too much.</p><p>Alice had done Rio a solid and arranged for her and Wanda to arrive on the boat together, which meant that Rio could spend at least the first day of the festival with someone she liked and was technically working so Alice couldn’t tell her <em>not</em> to just stand gossiping with Wanda.</p><p>Turned out that this paid dividends for both Rio and Alice because whilst the press went insane over capturing the two of them together, Wanda had just finished filming on a set with a tyrannical director with a penchant for furious rages.</p><p>Which meant that Alice got what she wanted and so did Rio.</p><p>The gossip was so juicy that it continued into the late night as the three of them had dinner together in a small restaurant in the heart of the city.</p><p>“I’m telling you, I don’t understand how he’s still working.”</p><p>“He’s a man,” Rio said dismissively, swirling her Chianti, “and he’s considered a genius which is practically a pass for any kind of bad behaviour.”</p><p>“Rio, you don’t understand he was <em>savage</em>. At one point I thought he was going to go for the production assistant.”</p><p>Rio grimaced and Alice frowned at Wanda, “Did you have anyone come in to intervene?”</p><p>“No, a few of us-…” she stopped abruptly then because the waiter had come over to fill their wine glasses. When he was gone she cleared her throat and continued, “so, yeah, we rallied round, made sure everyone felt protected as best we could and… that was it.”</p><p>Rio reached for Wanda’s hand and squeezed it gently, “You could have called. I was just in London, I could have easily hopped a flight-…”</p><p>“Sweetheart, you <em>never</em> answer your phone. Plus if your schedule is anything like mine you wouldn’t have had any time to swoop in and do what, exactly?”</p><p>Rio shrugged but smiled a little, “I don’t know? Be a drinking buddy?”</p><p>“That’d help. Dealing with a maniac on a hangover.”</p><p>Rio laughed and pulled her hand away, “Whatever gets you through.”</p><p>Wanda smirked and took a sip of her drink before she turned to Alice with a sudden change of topic.</p><p>“So, Alice, you are in a lot of trouble with a lot of different people, I hope you know.”</p><p>This was news to Rio and apparently news to Alice who looked more than a little shocked as she placed her wine down. “Why?”</p><p>“Oh,” Wanda grinned and Rio relaxed instantly, knowing it couldn’t be bad if Wanda were getting enjoyment out of it, “getting your client to be announced as the best actress alive right now’s favourite actress.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and ran a hand through her hair, “It’s so offensive that you don’t think I’m just <em>that good</em>.”</p><p>Wanda laughed and Alice smirked as she leant back in her chair, “Unfortunately I’m not powerful enough to make Agatha Harkness say anything she doesn’t want to so that was all Rio.”</p><p>“That good,” Rio repeated, shrugging with a grin and making Wanda roll her eyes at her.</p><p>“Unbelievable.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“Don’t think you’re winning though. It’s hers to take.”</p><p>“Oh, I know. And now Sylvia’s gone and said something racist it would be a miracle if she were even nominated.”</p><p>“I heard.”</p><p>Alice hummed quietly and glanced around them, cautious of any eavesdroppers, “It’s an industry town right now. Keep your voices down.”</p><p>Rio raised a brow and looked around briefly too, “I’m pretty sure everyone here is Italian and no one much cares what we’re saying.”</p><p>“Haven’t we had one too many lucky escapes with the press lately?”</p><p>Rio shifted in her seat, her eyes darting briefly to Wanda and hoping she wouldn’t pick up on Alice’s insinuation. But she did.</p><p>“What did they not get you on?”</p><p>“Alice, don’t.”</p><p>“What? You did it, the least you could do is own up to it.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and leant forwards towards Wanda, “I had a… moment with Agatha’s husband and then a… moment with a girl on a beach.”</p><p>“A moment? Is that what they’re calling it these days?”</p><p>Rio laughed and leant back again, “anyway, nothing happened so it’s nothing to worry about.”</p><p>“I don’t know, babe. It’s a little perverted if you ask me: sex on a beach and sex with another woman’s husband. Maybe speak to your therapist about it.”</p><p>Alice grinned at Wanda, enjoying having an ally in Rio-ribbing and Rio just smirked as she sipped her wine. “In case you hadn’t noticed I don’t swing that way and Ralph is… well I wouldn’t even if I did. Both very cruel friends.”</p><p>“You love us.”</p><p>“Unfortunately for me.”</p><p>So Venice went by easily, and Rio barely thought about her inconvenient crush at all.</p><p>She spent almost every second with Alice and now Wanda in tow, and focused her efforts on being as effortlessly charming for the interviewers and cameras as possible.</p><p>Every morning, Alice woke her with news of the previous night’s press.</p><p>“Everyone’s insane for the photos and you and Wanda on the boat. X is blowing up with people wanting you-…”</p><p>“Call it ‘Twitter’, please. We don’t like that man.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah. Anyway, best dressed, best dressed, best dressed. You’ve practically won the festival.”</p><p>It helped a lot in moments like these, when Rio was exhausted in her bed and Alice was shoving her phone in her face, that Rio loved her best friend so much. She couldn’t imagine a world where Alice were just someone she paid and not someone she could happily see every moment of the day and not get sick of.</p><p>But by the time she was back home in her little house in the Hollywood Hills, Rio was determined to speak to no one and be comatose for two days.</p><p>The exception to this rule was of course Alice, though she was mostly busy fielding journalist requests and making up for lost time with Jen, and her mother, whom she called to tell all about the festival and to let her know she was home safe.</p><p>But two days of being horizontal soon disappeared and Rio, on the third day she was back from home, found that suddenly she felt rested and relaxed enough to actually be looking forward to seeing Agatha without the usual fear that she’d say or do something stupid or embarrassing - though there was always still that risk.</p><p>She hopped in the car with her hopes high that today would be a good day and called Alice on her way over, following Google Maps as she went.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“Nervous?”</p><p>“No, I think… I think you cured me.”</p><p><em>Liar.</em></p><p>“Good. So all you need to do is not injure the kid and not try to kiss her or anything, okay?”</p><p>“Asshole. How’s Jen? You didn’t tell her about…?”</p><p>“Of course not. She’s fine. She’s away on a call with a studio. I told her I loved her last night.”</p><p>“You did? And?!”</p><p>“Well, she said it back.”</p><p>Rio laughed and grinned as she took the next turning, “Alice, I’m so pleased for you.”</p><p>“Not mad still we won’t both die alone together?”</p><p>“Nah, there’s room for Jen in our little beachfront retirement home.”</p><p>“I’ll be sure to let her know.”</p><p>“I’ll call you later, okay? When I’m heading back.”</p><p>“Sure. I need to talk to you about Late Night anyway.”</p><p>“Fine. Speak later.”</p><p>“Bye, Rio. Behave.”</p><p>Rio smiled to herself as she watched the little phone modal disappear on her car display.</p><p>Alice was happy, maybe soon to be settled. Miracles did happen. It was enough to relax her further as she drove the rest of the way to Agatha’s home deep in the Hills.</p><p>The street was quiet, with large houses spread along it, all white buildings with terracotta roofs. It looked not unlike where Rio stayed though the houses along here were, admittedly, much larger than hers.</p><p>Rio pulled up slowly in front of Agatha’s home and as she turned the key in the ignition to shut off the engine she felt for the first time in weeks a sudden nervousness.</p><p>It crept over her body slowly, so that stepping out of the car felt like a momentous task. But it was 4:01pm so she had to make herself move for fear Agatha would consider her late.</p><p>She stepped out into the afternoon heat and reached in the back of her little hybrid to take the gifts she’d brought for Agatha and Nicky, wondering suddenly if she should have brought something more, something grander.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>She shouldered her bag of gifts and tucked the basketball she’d bought with her under her arm, took one last deep breath, and made for the gate. She pressed the buzzer and chewed the inside of her lip as she waited for it to grant her entry, wondering if Agatha had any staff who would greet her before she had to come face to face with her herself.</p><p>But she didn’t have to wait long.</p><p>Ten seconds later the sound of the gate unlocking let Rio know she could push it open and she entered into a small court yard before a stately 1930’s villa home.</p><p>The lawn either side of the little walkway was perfectly manicured with palms and bird of paradise plants along the edges. And above the entranceway, creating a grand porch, were two stone pillars, framing the arched front door that stood open with Agatha Harkness in the middle of it.</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped a beat at the sight of her but she forced herself to remain calm, repeating Alice’s words in her own mind: “Get over yourself.”</p><p>“I wasn’t sure you’d show.”</p><p>“Are you kidding? Basketball and an excuse to hang with my biggest fan? What would keep me away?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled warmly as Rio got closer and she stepped aside to let her in.</p><p>The impact of stepping into Agatha’s home was immediate. Even in the foyer it felt warm, comfortable, and it had Agatha’s signature charm all over it.</p><p>“He’s just out back,” Agatha said, answering a question Rio hadn’t even asked or considered as she turned to look at Agatha with an incredulous grin.</p><p>“You gotta give a girl a second to take this in. Your house is huge.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and hesitated for only a second before she placed a quick kiss to Rio’s cheek and then motioned for Rio to follow her.</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip as she followed her through to the kitchen, taking her around the large round table in the middle of the square entranceway with a fresh floral arrangement in the middle of it, trying not to focus on the faint blush she knew to be across her cheeks now.</p><p>Rio turned this way and that, spotting an inviting looking living area to the side with a mosaic fireplace and a door off of that, noticing the mirrors and art on the walls and the soft furnishings that gave the white house colour and comfort.</p><p>“Seriously. My place is tiny compared to this.”</p><p>“If you don’t stop talking about how big my house is, I’ll ask you to leave.”</p><p>They’d arrived in the kitchen now and Rio had a sinking feeling that her gifts would leave quite a lot to be desired at the sight of it.</p><p>“Holy shit,” she mumbled quietly, but Agatha had caught it and raised a brow at her.</p><p>“What? You’ve been to industry parties before. You must have seen some of the mansions in the Hills.”</p><p>“Yeah, but they’re all glass and metal this is… Agatha, this is gorgeous.”</p><p>Agatha seemed to soften then and she leant back against the countertop, watching Rio as she did a once over of the open plan kitchen, her eyes lingering on the breakfast nook just off of it and her breath taken away by the way Agatha had managed to make the space seem cosy, despite being in one of the largest houses on the street, in one of the most expensive neighbourhoods in Los Angeles.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said with a smile that Rio returned when she looked back to her.</p><p>In her admiration of the house, she’d missed taking in Agatha’s appearance, which meant she’d almost forgotten her nerves.</p><p>Agatha now looked at her in a soft grey sweater, wearing light jeans and bare feet, fresh faced with little makeup and her hair up in an effortlessly messy bun, she looked exactly as Rio remembered: beautiful and intoxicating.</p><p>“I,” she started before she could be accused of staring, “I bought some… umm, well,” she shuffled and placed the clean basketball on the marble island beside her, and then fished in her bag.</p><p>“You didn’t need to bring <em>anything</em>,” Agatha clarified, folding her arms loosely across her chest as Rio pulled out her gift.</p><p>“My mom made these last time she was here. Actually, it was whilst we were in Italy. She comes and goes when I’m away just to get away, y’know? Anyway, she makes the best empanadas in the world so…”</p><p>She held up the large tupperware box and for a second felt like the biggest loser on the planet, offering the biggest movie star on the planet a box of her mother’s defrosted empanadas as a gift.</p><p>But Agatha looked touched and stepped forwards to take the box with a gentle smile, “You didn’t need to bring these.”</p><p>“You’re hosting. It’s polite.”</p><p>“It’s too much. I hope you kept some for yourself?”</p><p>“I’ve had a million.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and reached to touch Rio’s arm which sent a jolt of imagined electricity through her body that she wasn’t expecting and Rio flinched a little, playing it off by moving her arm quickly to run through her hair.</p><p>If Agatha noticed, she pretended not to, and went to put the box of empanadas in the large fridge opposite Rio, speaking as she did: “Nicky’s been excited about this since I told him you were coming.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Mm. Apparently I’m not very good and his father…” she trailed off as she closed the door and turned back around, “Well. He’s excited.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and picked her basketball back up again, spinning it in the air before catching it once more. “I can teach you a few things if you like? So you don’t embarrass yourself in front of a seven year old?”</p><p>“Watch it,” Agatha warned with a smile as she made to swipe the ball from Rio’s hands as she threw it up to spin again but Rio was too quick and laughed as Agatha stumbled closer.</p><p>For a second it felt like nothing at all, the two of them, in Agatha’s kitchen, now less than a foot apart. And Rio forgot that she had a crush. She forgot that she couldn’t have Agatha. She forgot everything because she was close once more and looking at her in a way that Rio found she’d missed in their two months apart.</p><p>“Precocious,” Agatha accused with a glint in her eye and Rio hummed, narrowing her gaze a little.</p><p>“Not sure you can be precocious past the age of twelve?”</p><p>But Agatha only laughed a little and instead of trying for the ball again she stepped closer and placed her hands on Rio’s where they held the ball between them.</p><p>Rio sucked in a short sharp breath and Agatha’s brow furrowed just slightly as she watched her, “Come meet Nicky? I promise he’ll be worthy of you.”</p><p>Rio fought the grin for only a moment and then nodded, her fingers twitched beneath Agatha’s and her pinky moving to cross over Agatha’s on her right hand.</p><p>“I’m sure he will be.”</p><p>Blue eyes dropped briefly to where Rio held her little finger and Agatha seemed to hesitate before she pulled away, leading the way out to the backyard with a wave of her hand.</p><p>Rio picked up her tote bag again and followed her out, internally groaning at the hold this woman had on her.</p><p>It was insane to think that she was married to a man. A waste, she thought, as she stepped into the yard with her, and her eyes widened at the sight of it.</p><p>There was a wooden veranda directly off the kitchen with a little seating area with two cushioned chairs and a two-seater armchair. On the little table in the middle of them was a tray with five glasses and what looked like fresh lemonade in a jug and then a bottle of white wine chilling in an ice bucket.</p><p>But the view beyond this was what took Rio’s breath away. The yard was surrounded by tall palms and potted plants that dotted about the space, adding green to the area that housed a large rectangular pool with a smaller hot tub in the middle of it, raised up to create a water fall dropping into the crystal clear water.</p><p>Rio could see hanging lanterns in the trees and saw across the water another seating area with more comfortable chairs and sofas and an awning that gave it privacy and the cosiness she’d felt inside.</p><p>She glanced to the right and saw a built in bar and barbecue area and had to work hard not to let her jaw drop at the sheer opulence of it all.</p><p>“Stop staring,” Agatha said smoothly, turning to Rio with an amused smile, “Really. You’re being very uncool, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Agatha, this-…”</p><p>But she was cut off suddenly by the noise of heavy footsteps coming towards them and the sight of an out of breath little boy shocked Rio back down to reality.</p><p>Nicky.</p><p>He ran beaming towards them and threw himself to his mother’s side, but grinned at Rio as he pressed into Agatha and hid half against her.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha said softly, placing a hand on Nicky’s back and gently coaxing him from his hiding place to stand in front of her where she could place her hands on his shoulders and introduce him properly to their guest.</p><p>“Nicky, this is Rio. Rio,” she looked up at Rio with a proud smile, “the best basketball player in all of California, Nicholas Harkness.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes moved from Nicky to Agatha and back again but before she could say anything Nicky had held out his hand to Rio, not saying anything but looking at her expectantly.</p><p>Rio laughed a little at the formality of it but stepped closer and shook his hand, grinning at the heavy up and down motion he provided.</p><p>He had long brown hair, tucked behind his ears and in a loose ponytail, dark hazel eyes and a slightly off-kilter shy smile.</p><p>Agatha had made a cute kid.</p><p>“A pleasure to meet you, Nicky. I hear you’re going to embarrass me quite a bit on the court.”</p><p>“Mom says you’re really good.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio asked with an even wider grin, shooting an amused glance at Agatha before focusing back in on Nicky, “She’s exaggerating. But I have heard that she’s <em>terrible</em> so maybe I’m just better than her?”</p><p>“Watch it,” Agatha said again with a smile at Rio before she bent down to kiss a giggling Nicky on the cheek and murmured, “go pour us all some lemonade and you can play soon, okay?”</p><p>Nicky ran off dutifully and poured the drinks as Rio watched Agatha watch her son.</p><p>“Adorable,” Rio whispered so only Agatha would hear and she turned to her with a gentle smile, tilting her head just a little in acknowledgement before she touched Rio’s arm and stepped over to take a seat on the little couch.</p><p>Nicky settled on one of the chairs and Rio took a seat beside Agatha, placing the ball gently down so it wouldn’t roll away by the table.</p><p>“So,” Rio said officially, keeping her tote bag in her lap and turning her attention to Nicky as he drank from his glass of lemonade.</p><p>“Your mom didn’t tell me which team you supported. Which made bringing you a jersey very difficult.”</p><p>“A jersey?” Nicky asked in surprise, wiping his mouth quickly.</p><p>“Well, a true basketball player has to have a jersey when he plays.”</p><p>“Right,” Nicky said, suddenly serious and watching Rio like she were the Queen of the Basketballers.</p><p>Agatha, on the other end of the couch leant back against the arm, her eyes darting between Nicky’s serious face and Rio’s smiling profile.</p><p>“Now I only bought these just in case because I assume you have one already?”</p><p>“I have a couple.”</p><p>“Good! So what’s your team?”</p><p>Nicky looked concerned for a second, looking to Agatha for help and Agatha leant forward, her hand landing on the couch just beside Rio’s knee.</p><p>“Well, he’s between teams at the moment. I like the Lakers’ purple, his dad likes the Bulls.”</p><p>Rio grimaced and glanced around at Agatha who raised her brows at her, “Something wrong with either of those?”</p><p>But Rio had turned back quickly to Nicky and hummed pensively, pursing her lips. “Which do you like?”</p><p>“I… I don’t know. Both.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said slowly, “both is fine.”</p><p>She was about to follow up when Nicky quickly asked: “Which do you like?”</p><p>“Well,” Rio started with an amused grin, “my team has been the same team since I was about your age.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Celtics,” Rio said as she reached into her tote to pull from it a green jersey. “I liked the green and my dad used to take me to games when he had the time.”</p><p>Nicky nodded seriously and Rio felt the brush of Agatha’s fingers just graze the side of her thigh.</p><p>“I like green too.”</p><p>“You do? Well, I have one other jersey I brought with me. And it’s a special one too because this is my best friend’s team.”</p><p>Rio pulled out the second jersey, holding it up properly for Nicky to take in. “Warriors. She grew up in San Francisco so this is her team.”</p><p>Rio looked down at the navy blue jersey hanging in front of her and then raised her gaze once more to Nicky who seemed to be taking this discussion incredibly seriously and she felt a wave of affection for the little boy.</p><p>“Okay,” he said slowly, glancing across at his mother.</p><p>Rio raised her brows and glanced back at Agatha before focusing back in to Nicky and asking: “Okay? Do you want to wear this one?”</p><p>“No, I…” Nicky hesitated and his eyes went wide for a second as Rio gently dropped the navy blue jersey back into her lap, feeling the silky fabric fall over where Agatha’s hand was, her fingers only just making contact with the skin near the bend of her left knee.</p><p>“Can I wear yours?”</p><p>“Nicky,” Agatha gasped dramatically, removing her hand from the couch to place across her heart in a theatrical display, “And not your mother’s favourite team? That purple is lovely.”</p><p>Nicky grinned suddenly and Rio snorted as she leant back to look at Agatha, “Name one player on the Lakers.”</p><p>She heard Nicky laugh and from the corner of her eye saw him bounce a little in his seat but kept her gaze on Agatha who pretended to think for a second before she pronounced: “John Smith.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but grinned at Agatha, batting lightly at her arm before she turned to Nicky and picked her green Celtics jersey back up, holding it out to him, “Fine, you can wear this. But just this once, okay? And then when you pick a team I’ll bring you the right colours, alright?”</p><p>“This is my team,” Nicky announced without a second’s hesitation, taking the jersey with a smile.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond but didn’t know what to say and simply watched as Nicky slipped the too-large jersey over his t-shirt and grinned down at it.</p><p>A movement on the couch told her that Agatha had moved closer and so she wasn’t surprised when she heard her voice close to her ear, “You’re already more popular than me.”</p><p>Rio fought her laugh just as much has she fought a shiver and turned a little to raise her brows at Agatha, “Seems I’m everyone’s favourite in this household.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her and Rio felt a familiar brush near her side but she anticipated it before Agatha could jab her and she moved quickly, standing from her seat to shrug off her light blue shirt so she was just in her white tank.</p><p>“Okay!” She announced, shoving Alice’s Warrior’s jersey over her head. “Will we go play?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Nicky jumped up and motioned for Rio to follow him. Rio shot Agatha a quick wink as she scooped up the ball and went to follow her new biggest fan to the small patio’d area around the corner.</p><p>She figured she’d be safe for a while if she focused in on Nicky and not on the complicated woman who had just been touching her thigh out of the eyeline of her young son.</p><p>There was a basketball hoop set up on the wall and a discarded ball already laying there at the bottom.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said with a smile as Nicky turned to her and held up his hands to catch the ball, “show me what you got. Take a shot.”</p><p>Nicky caught the ball on the bounce and turned to shoot his shot, missing as it hit the rim and ricocheted off.</p><p>“Close,” Rio reassured, already darting off to fetch the ball as it bounced towards the trees, “again, let’s see those master skills at work.”</p><p>Focusing in on Nicky and keeping his excitement levels up, Rio missed Agatha join them and lean against one of the trees with a glass of wine, her blue eyes darting between her son and the woman entertaining and coaching him.</p><p>And Nicky, though Rio wasn’t at all surprised by this, had clearly inherited all of his mother’s charm. He listened carefully to everything Rio told him, he watched with a seriousness that belied his age, and he grinned with such abandon that Rio wondered if Agatha had ever grinned like that in her life.</p><p>It didn’t take long for her to become fond of him, and clearly Nicky was fond of Rio.</p><p>After an hour or so of playing in the sun, Agatha stepped onto the court and held her hands in the air to stop the game, right when Rio was in the middle of an allstar run.</p><p>“Okay, enough basketball now? Can we all sit down and enjoy a cool drink and some snacks?”</p><p>Rio laughed and Nicky shook his head, “Noooo! We haven’t finished.”</p><p>“One more point,” Rio pleaded teasingly, smiling breathlessly at Agatha where she’d been running around the court like a madman, trying to elicit the feeling for Nicky of being at a real game.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but dropped her hands where they hung in the sky and said in an exasperated tone, “One. Score one more and then done.”</p><p>“Okay, kid. Remember what we just discussed?” Rio shot Nicky a smile and motioned with her head where he should stand, already spinning the ball in her hands.</p><p>Nicky moved obediently and his toothy smile disappeared as he focused in and Rio had to bite her lip to stop from grinning at the change in his expression</p><p>Agatha hadn’t moved yet from the court and so Rio took advantaged of this, bouncing the ball expertly around her, making out like she’d try to take it, and spinning dramatically around her and then bouncing it back to Nicky who caught it easily and turned to aim and shoot.</p><p>He missed, but only just, and Rio was quick to recover the ball and bounce it back to him, this time scooping him up and allowing him to score in an assisted alley-oop.</p><p>When the ball flew through the net, Rio cheered and placed Nicky on her shoulder with a soft grunt of effort and began running with him to Agatha who laughed as loudly as Rio had ever heard it.</p><p>She caught them both, stumbling back a little in surprise but maintaining balance as she helped Rio to balance Nicky and soon stole him from her hold, making a soft noise of exertion as she pulled him down into her own arms and spun him around.</p><p>“A regular John Smith!”</p><p>Rio laughed and clutched her stomach as she caught her breath, beaming at the mother and son duo as Agatha halted her spin and let Nicky drop to his feet.</p><p>“Are you doing that on purpose?”</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked with an innocent smile, “He’s the best player.”</p><p>Rio was so exhausted that she couldn’t bring herself to argue and instead smiled widely at Agatha, only looking away when an excited seven year old threw himself at her and wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>Rio released a quiet ‘oomph’ at the sudden smack to her body but quickly dropped down to hug Nicky properly, laughing as he held on tight, his arms now around her neck.</p><p>“Come play again?” He asked quietly into Rio’s ear and Rio nodded gently, feeling strangely emotional about the request.</p><p>“Sure. Whenever you want.”</p><p>She pulled back only when Nicky did and saw in his face the return of his shyness that Agatha had told her about all those weeks ago back in the pool.</p><p>He didn’t quite meet her gaze again as he ran off to where the lemonade was and Rio was left standing with Agatha, feeling clammy and tired in the late-afternoon sun.</p><p>“You’re good with kids,” Agatha said softly, watching Rio with a kind of tenderness that made Rio want to turn away and hide from.</p><p>“I… probably just kids who like basketball. Or any other sports, maybe. Mostly basketball.”</p><p>She shrugged a little self-consciously and rubbed the back of her neck, mortified to feel that it actually was a little clammy and clearing her throat as she turned to where Nicky had run off to.</p><p>“He’s a good kid. You should be-…”</p><p>But her words died the instant she felt Agatha’s hands on hers and she turned suddenly to see Agatha close, holding her left hand in both of her own.</p><p>Rio felt something swell in her chest and couldn’t fight it as whatever the feeling was made her right hand move to rest over Agatha’s too, her eyes wide as she took in the face before her, wondering how she’d gone so long without being able to look at it.</p><p>“Stay,” Agatha instructed softly, not exactly a demand, not exactly a request. “Have dinner with us.”</p><p>Rio could only nod once, her mind a mysterious blank where it had just been firing on all cylinders, buoyed by the enjoyment of the exercise.</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched ever so slightly and Rio felt her whole world stop as she leant in to her.</p><p>It must be what it felt like to die, she thought. Everything slow, everything wonderful.</p><p>As if she couldn’t take it in properly, her eyes fluttered closed and it was in the darkness that she felt Agatha’s lips against her skin for the first time in weeks.</p><p>Her cheek was flushed and she was sure it was a little sticky with the sweat from the past hour or so she’d been pulling out all the stops for Nicky in the Los Angeles sun.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t recoiled. She’d pressed her lips to Rio’s cheek like she’d meant to do it, like she’d meant to anchor there for longer than would be considered a greeting in a European country or a friendly exchange between two movie stars.</p><p>But it couldn’t last forever.</p><p>And so Agatha pulled back and when she did, Rio’s eyes fluttered open and she turned her head ever so slightly towards her, seeking more of her warmth, wanting more.</p><p>As Rio moved and Agatha pulled back so slowly that Rio could have counted every freckle, their noses brushed and Rio sucked in sharp breath that caused the spell to be broken and for Agatha to pull away entirely.</p><p>Their eyes met and Rio saw that Agatha’s were darker than usual, her pupils swallowing the usual blue of her irises. Her lips were parted and her cheeks were flushed and Rio’s brain short-circuited when she saw where Agatha’s gaze was.</p><p>And then the world righted itself.</p><p>There was a shout.</p><p>A greeting.</p><p>A man’s voice.</p><p>Ralph was home.</p>

<p>Ralph.</p><p>Rio had forgotten about the husband.</p><p>In all the work she’d put into convincing herself that she only wanted Agatha because she couldn’t have her, she’d forgotten about the main reason she couldn’t have her.</p><p>Her gaze fell from Agatha’s suddenly panicked eyes to the joined hands between them and she hesitated for a second before she pulled away, taking a step back and clearing her throat.</p><p>“Ralph?” She asked needlessly, watching as Agatha’s panic morphed to something different and she’d turned from her to march around to where Nicky had gone.</p><p>“He wasn’t supposed to be here.”</p><p>Rio felt suddenly like a spare part, no, like a mistress.</p><p>Without the obvious benefits.</p><p>She ran a hand through her hair and awkwardly patted her jersey down, though really there was nothing she could do to make herself look more presentable as she followed Agatha back around the house to where her husband had clearly arrived.</p><p>She was ashamed of herself but for what, she couldn’t really fathom. Maybe lustful thought, but those she’d had about various people since she was a teenage. Maybe that she’d half convinced herself that Agatha might return them.</p><p>Maybe because she thought if Ralph hadn’t arrived Agatha might have kissed her.</p><p>Waiting for them by the outdoor sitting area was a tall man with a dark sweep of hair that Rio recognised immediately as the surface-level polite husband of the woman she’d prefer to have all to herself.</p><p>A Clark Kent-type without the glasses and not for the first time Rio couldn’t help but see how someone, inclined to men, could fall for him. Which made it worse. But then maybe Rio wasn’t cruel enough to wish Agatha were married to an ugly man.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>A red-blooded American finance bro with a strong jaw and a winning smile.</p><p>And Rio stood, a Puerto-Rican American woman with a basketball jersey that wasn’t hers and a light sheen of sweat across her brow.</p><p>Who would ever pick her?</p><p>Ralph turned to Agatha from where he’d been sat in the place Rio had been only an hour or so ago and gestured to their son, “Celtics? Really?”</p><p>Rio hated this guy.</p><p>“It’s my team,” Nicky said quietly and Rio shot him a reassuring wink as she stopped beside Agatha.</p><p>“I thought you’d be out all night,” Agatha said with such a lack of warmth that Rio turned to look at her, taken aback by this display.</p><p>“I came home to change,” Ralph said distractedly, now eyeing Rio as he stood and moved to offer her a hand, “Hi. Rio, right? You look different to the last time I saw you?”</p><p><em>Yeah, I’ve not been sat through hair and makeup for the last three hours you fucking asshole.</em></p><p>Rio shook the hand offered to her, refusing to look away from the man who so clearly wanted to say ‘you look much worse’.</p><p>“It’s amazing what a team of makeup artists and hair dressers can do.”</p><p>Ralph smiled a little and glanced at Rio’s jersey, guessing correctly, “so you’re the basketball influencer?”</p><p>“I just came over to test my skills against Nicky’s.”</p><p>She leant round slightly, and shot the boy a smile before looking back up to Ralph, almost daring him to say something.</p><p>The man seemed disinterested though, or else, already smug that whatever he thought the battle was, he’d won.</p><p>He had Agatha after all.</p><p>But Agatha interjected and moved just enough in front of Rio that Ralph had no choice but to turn to her instead, “You should hurry if you want to make your dinner reservations. Especially if you want a drink beforehand.”</p><p>“Actually,” Ralph said with a raise of his brows, looking past his wife and to Rio, “A lot of the guys in the office are fans of yours. I didn’t get to ask in Cannes and this might be a little strange but… mind if I get a selfie? They’d shit themselves if they-…”</p><p>Agatha had cleared her throat.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth and then closed it again, surprised by the request. But she couldn’t think of an excuse quickly enough to deny it so she simply nodded her assent and surreptitiously tucked her hair behind her ear.</p><p>“Excellent,” Ralph grinned and Rio once again saw what Agatha must find attractive in him. He had a boyish charm.</p><p>Superman in a suit.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha said suddenly in a tone much softer than the one she’d used with Ralph earlier, “why don’t you go to your room? You can have an hour on your Switch before dinner, okay?”</p><p>Rio looked on as Nicky beamed and disappeared before the offer could be rescinded and Rio smiled a little at the sight, thinking that having been within Ralph’s presence for collectively less than twenty minutes she already couldn’t see any of him in his son.</p><p>And Ralph paid his son absolutely no mind as he reached over to pour himself a glass of wine, only pouring one for Rio and Agatha too when Agatha cleared her throat pointedly again and the man remembered his manners. “Excuse me, should be ladies first.”</p><p>“Where are you from?” Rio asked suddenly, accepting the glass offered to her without a thank you and trying her hardest to remain polite when all she wanted to do was run away.</p><p>“Dallas, originally. Moved to Chicago when I was a kid.”</p><p>“Hence the Bulls?”</p><p>Ralph smiled and thanked the universe that she was, fortunately, immune to his charms.</p><p>“Yes. Where exactly did my son get the idea in his head that Celtics was the way to go?”</p><p>“That would be me.”</p><p>Ralph took such a large gulp of his wine that made Rio raise her brows a little but he only nodded once he’d swallowed it down, “I suppose you can’t force a team on a kid. He’ll pick his own one day.”</p><p>“So,” he said suddenly, before Rio had even had a chance to take a sip of her wine, “selfie and then I’ll be on my way.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly and shot Agatha a quick glance and in seeing that she looked a little paler than usual she decided she didn’t mind doing this quick favour to get this man as far away as possible.</p><p>She shuffled to the edge of the couch and placed her glass down, and paused momentarily where Ralph had scuffed his chair along the stone slabs to push it back to the couch, holding his arm out behind him for Rio to slip into.</p><p>But Agatha had stood up before Rio made to move.</p><p>“Let me take it.”</p><p>Rio glanced around and saw that Agatha looked furious, her hand held out for Ralph’s phone, her fingers already twitching in a ‘give it to me’ motion.</p><p>“You’re the boss,” Ralph said in a tone that made Rio want to hit him.</p><p>But he stood and Rio stood too, allowing him to drape his arm around her waist and pull her closer than she’d have liked.</p><p>He smelled like expensive after shave and a hint of whiskey and Rio fought hard to force a smile when in interactions like these they usually came so easily.</p><p>But her gaze met Agatha’s above the phone she held to take the photo and when it did she felt the heavy weight of reality.</p><p>This was Agatha’s home.</p><p>This was Agatha’s husband.</p><p>Agatha took just one photo of the two of them and Rio decided she didn’t want to see what it looked like but she could bet she looked sweaty and uninterested in it.</p><p>“Here,” Agatha said as he held the phone back out to her husband, and Ralph took it with one hand, his other still on Rio’s waist.</p><p>Rio moved from his hold and went to stand a little further away, which Ralph didn’t object to, and Rio realised that he’d been holding her as if it were his right but that he had no real knowledge of his own actions: he was simply a man who was used to having a pretty woman on his arm.</p><p>But that didn’t sit well with her and apparently not Agatha either who’d moved around to take Rio’s hand and tug her in the direction of the lone armchair opposite where Nicky had been sitting.</p><p>Rio moved without question or thought and even sat down, looking up at Agatha as though to expect more instruction, but they never came.</p><p>“They’ll love this,” Ralph was saying with that same charming grin across his face.</p><p>“Really.” He turned to Rio and held his phone up like a trophy even with Agatha now standing between the two of them like an armed guard. “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, smiling a little at the type of man who would consider the look on her face in the photo to be a ‘grin’ from a pretty girl and she brushed her hands down the tops of her thighs slowly as she watched Ralph turn back to his phone and broadcast the picture to anyone and everyone he thought would be impressed by it.</p><p>“Rio, Nicky, and I were going to have dinner,” Agatha said firmly, still standing between Rio and her husband, “I assume you’ll be back later?”</p><p>“Actually,” Ralph turned with that same, brilliant grin, “I might stay out with the boys. That okay, hon?”</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha said with a kind of shrug, and Rio watched as Ralph leant in and placed a firm kiss to Agatha’s cheek, making a ‘mwah’ sound that Rio would have thought Agatha would hate but she didn’t respond at all.</p><p>Ralph then turned and threw the rest of his wine down his throat, wincing ever so slightly and then turning to smile at Rio, back to his charming self.</p><p>“Nice to see you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio barely had a chance to wave before the man had turned on his heel and disappeared back into the house.</p><p>It was strange. Being suddenly confronted again with the person the subject of your months-long fascination had chosen to be with.</p><p>Because Rio wouldn’t have picked Ralph for Agatha.</p><p>She’d known that the first time she met him. She knew that now.</p><p>Sure, he was handsome, seemingly harmless though a bit obtuse, but there wasn’t much substance to him, no real personality past the cookie cutter mould he’d been carved out of.</p><p>But who was Rio to say it didn’t work. She’d been told for weeks now how ‘happily married’ Agatha was.</p><p>And maybe Agatha turned a blind eye to Ralph who sometimes looked at other women, maybe sometimes touched.</p><p>But all evidence pointed the way of a happy, functioning marriage: a cute, well-adjusted kid, a great house. What else was there?</p><p>And Rio, single and pining, was hardly a good judge of who was made for each other and who wasn’t.</p><p>So Agatha maybe flirted a little, she was a movie star, she was built to be charming to everyone. And Rio just so happened to be charmed by everything she did.</p><p>With Ralph now disappeared upstairs to change, Rio turned her attention back to Agatha and saw that she was still standing, and she reached for her hand that was nearest to her, tugging lightly at it to pull her to sit just as Agatha had done to her earlier.</p><p>Agatha allowed this and slowly sat down on the couch and reached with her free hand for her wine, taking a sip before she spoke, “Sorry, he’s just… busy with work and he doesn’t get a lot of time to blow off steam so…”</p><p>Rio recognised an excuse when she saw one and gently turned Agatha’s hand over in her own two, interlinking their fingers together without saying anything for a while.</p><p>“He’s handsome. Very handsome.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed lightly and when Rio looked up from their joined hands she saw Agatha was looking at her.</p><p>“What?” Rio asked quietly, a small smile tugging at her lips, “You think just because I like girls I can’t recognise a handsome man?”</p><p>“No, I just…” Agatha sighed and Rio’s smile faded as she shifted in her seat to watch Agatha.</p><p>“What? Think I have bad taste?”</p><p>Agatha laughed and turned to Rio properly, her smile not quite reaching her eyes as she gazed across at her, “I don’t know anything about your taste.”</p><p>“It’s good,” Rio said, “I promise you that.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to say something but closed it again almost as quickly and Rio wriggled her brows at her, attempting to get her eyes to light up again as they had on the basketball court.</p><p>“I’ll have to take your word for it.”</p><p>Agatha had whispered the words and Rio looked away suddenly for fear she’d see something in her gaze she’d never recover from. She felt dizzy with her need for Agatha, unsure how this had happened again when she’d entered the house so determined to keep a hold on herself and her emotions.</p><p>There was a beat.</p><p>A silence.</p><p>And then Rio squeezed Agatha’s hand, afterwards pulling her own away for fear she was overstepping.</p><p>Agatha allowed it but dropped her gaze to where Rio had placed her arm on the arm of the chair and offered suddenly: “You want to take a shower?”</p><p>“Oh? Do I smell?”</p><p>“No, I just-…”</p><p>And Rio looked up to meet blue eyes again and she bit down on her lip, watching as Agatha’s gaze flew briefly to her lower lip now pulled between her teeth.</p><p>It must have been a trick of the light, a misfire of her brain, because as soon as she thought she saw it, it was gone. Agatha’s gaze was back meeting her own and she was smiling slightly, “You’re maybe just a little sweatier than when you first arrived.”</p><p>“Just a little?”</p><p>Rio lifted her arm and made a show of smelling her armpit and Agatha laughed properly this time, and when Rio looked back at her she looked more relaxed.</p><p>But it lasted all of two seconds.</p><p>“Hon?”</p><p>Ralph had appeared back in the door, gazing over at his wife in a new clean, crisp outfit that looked very similar to the one he’d been wearing before.</p><p>Rio pulled her arm down quickly, a little mortified that she’d been caught out trying to impress his wife in the most juvenile way possible.</p><p>“My uber’s here. I’ll see you tomorrow?”</p><p>Rio felt her heart leap to her chest when Agatha stood from her seat and went to kiss Ralph’s cheek. And her treacherous brain told her that Agatha hadn’t kissed her like that. She’d been softer, lingering longer, had pulled back slower.</p><p>She dropped her gaze and reached for her wine.</p><p>She didn’t look up again until she heard Agatha sit down on the couch and even then she didn’t look Agatha’s way, just glancing up to where Ralph had previously been.</p><p>“Offer’s there,” Agatha said as if they hadn’t just been interrupted, “if you want to shower, you can.”</p><p>“I didn’t bring anything to change into,” Rio said, more shyly than she usually would and she caught Agatha’s gaze then, seeing her tongue dart out to wet her lips and feeling the dull blankness of her mind as she watched it retreat back into her mouth.</p><p>“I have clothes. A whole closet full.”</p><p>Rio met Agatha’s gaze then and wondered how long she could tolerate this. How long she could possibly spend being friendly with Agatha when all she could think about was kissing her.</p><p>All the time. Constantly. Forever.</p><p>“Then sure, if you don’t mind.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head and Rio put her wine back down to follow Agatha through the house. She took the time to look around, seeing things she’d missed before when they’d walked through to the kitchen then out to the back.</p><p>There were little photos of Nicky dotted about everywhere and pictures of Agatha with him, but Rio was yet to spot a picture of Ralph.</p><p>Just as she was wondering why that was, she collided into Agatha’s back as they reached the top of the stairs.</p><p>“Shit.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows as Rio straightened herself out and motioned to a door to the right on the large landing.</p><p>“Use the guest bathroom. Ralph will have just used ours so… you’ll find clean towels on the side and use whatever you want. I’ll find some clothes and leave them just outside for you.”</p><p>Rio nodded, suddenly feeling shy again and wondering whether this was a good idea.</p><p>But she’d committed already and it would look weird if she bailed so she shot Agatha a quick smile before she turned to disappear into the bathroom.</p><p>The room was large, pristine, and Rio resisted the urge to search through Agatha’s cabinets.</p><p>She didn’t want to dawdle so she stripped herself quickly of her clothes and stepped into the walk in shower, and after a few attempts got the waterfall head to turn on at just the right temperature.</p><p>She lathered herself in Agatha’s expensive soaps and washed her hair with shampoo and conditioner with fancy french names on a monochrome label.</p><p>Everything was expensive, everything felt and smelled incredible and Rio had to actively not think that soon she would smell like Agatha, and soon she would be wearing Agatha’s clothes.</p><p>But as she stepped out she had a horrifying realisation.</p><p>She was clean, fresh, and she now had two options: she either wore Agatha’s clothes with underwear she’d already worn that day, or she went commando.</p><p>Neither were good.</p><p>But she dried herself, squeezing as much water from her damp hair as possible with the plush white towel, and soon wrapped herself in it to open the door and look for the clothes that Agatha had promised to leave.</p><p>Sitting in a neat little pile was a light green cashmere sweater and white linen pants.</p><p>Celtics colours.</p><p>She smiled to herself as she pulled them inside and put them on.</p><p>She could smell Agatha’s fabric conditioner on them, and she checked herself over in the mirror, seeing herself reflected in Agatha’s clothes. Maybe the universe had a sense of humour because this wasn’t exactly how she’d fantasied about getting into Agatha’s pants.</p><p>She folded her old clothes up and left the bathroom with them, making sure to place her used towel in the laundry basket to the side.</p><p>When she went back down to find Agatha she saw the little table and chairs empty and looked around to find her.</p><p>Across the pool Agatha was sitting below the awning, smiling across at her and waving at her to make sure she’d spotted her.</p><p>It was almost too much to bear. Too domestic and easy.</p><p>But Rio placed her sweaty clothes in her tote bag and left it on the side to go and join Agatha in the more private part of the yard.</p><p>“A change of scenery?”</p><p>“It’s nicer under here when it gets a little darker,” Agatha said with a shrug, her gaze roaming over the sight of Rio before her in her clothes.</p><p>“Like the colour choice?”</p><p>“Subtle,” Rio said with a grin, taking a seat opposite Agatha in on of the little armchairs.</p><p>Agatha just hummed and reached over to pour some wine for Rio, leaning across to hold it out to her.</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen Nicky take to someone so quickly.”</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever taken to a kid so quickly as I did to him.”</p><p>Agatha bit on her lower lip and dropped her gaze to her own wine glass, swirling it slowly before her.</p><p>“Ever think about having kids of your own?”</p><p>Rio paused before she answered, wondering how honest she wanted to be.</p><p>“I’d have to find a woman first.”</p><p>“Wanda doesn’t want kids?”</p><p>Rio blinked, unsure she’d heard Agatha correctly. She tilted her head and remained silent until Agatha looked back up at her, “What?”</p><p>“I… I’m not dating Wanda, Agatha. Do you think I am?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged slightly, her eyes back down on her wine glass, “I saw you guys at the roundtable and I thought… maybe… and then at Venice you were-…”</p><p>“On the boat?” Rio asked with a frown, “We hung out together because Alice knew I was miserable and exhausted and needed a friend nearby.”</p><p>“They got pictures of you together out at a restaurant. Holding hands.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe what she was hearing. If holding hands with someone was all it took for Agatha to think they were dating then she must have considered her and Rio married five times over by now.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said gently, unable to get a hold on Agatha’s feelings about this.</p><p><em>Goddamn Best Actress</em>, she thought.</p><p>“Those photos were taken at a dinner with me, Wanda, and Alice. They just didn’t get Alice because she was beside me. And…,” she added with a little smile: “she’s little.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes darted back up then and she looked at Rio for a second before she said: “I just assumed…”</p><p>“We’re just friends.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly and Rio smiled a little, chewing her lip as she watched the cogs turn in Agatha’s mind and once again she found herself wishing she could unwind them, read what they were saying.</p><p>“But yes, if I found the right person, I’d want a family.”</p><p>It was a half-truth. The unspoken part of it being that right now, sitting in Agatha’s clothes, in her house, with her son upstairs, she wanted <em>this</em> family. Husband excluded.</p><p>“You’d be a good mom,” Agatha offered, and Rio saw that she’d drifted somewhere again, somewhere where Rio wouldn’t be able to reach her until she came back to herself.</p><p>“As good as you, I’d hope.”</p><p>Agatha laughed a little, “You’ve barely seen me as a mom.”</p><p>“But I know you as a woman. I’ve seen enough of Nicky to know he’s all you. There’s none of Ralph in him.”</p><p><em>Thank god</em>, Rio added for herself.</p><p>Agatha’s brows raised slowly and Rio could see that she was fighting off a small smile, “You think?”</p><p>“Practically a mini-you. Minus the attitude and the poor ball skills, of course.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile really hit then but she was rolling her eyes, tucking her legs beneath her on the couch. “Well now I don’t need to improve my skills because I have you.”</p><p>“Oh? Is that what this is? Pimping me out to your son for basketball practice? I’ll have you know I’m soon to win an Oscar.”</p><p>“Winning now, are you?”</p><p>“Best believe it, Harkness. Alice thinks you’ve secured me a good few votes with your public announcement of my being your favourite actress. She said Jen was pissed.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, “She got over it.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“Well, I’m pretty sure after a few heated phone calls with your manager she had to relent for fear she’d lose Alice.”</p><p>“That would never happen,” Rio said with her full chest, so certain that Alice was in it for the long haul with Jen. “Did she tell you they said ‘I love you’ last night?”</p><p>“She did.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and adjusted herself in her seat, resting her free arm along the arm of the chair, “Maybe they’ll have a kid.”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure Jen likes Nicky despite her protestations sometimes. Maybe they will.”</p><p>Rio hummed softly, wondering if this was a conversation Jen and Alice had already had because Alice was a big softy with babies.</p><p>“It’s hard not to like him.”</p><p>“Because he’s so like me?”</p><p>Rio laughed and reached for a chip from the large bowl in the centre of the table between them, “Sure, tell yourself that.”</p><p>Agatha grinned and took a sip of her wine before swirling it and looking off to the little basketball court in the distance, just about making out the net from where she sat.</p><p>“I mean it though, you can come over whenever you want, if you want. Nicky would be thrilled.”</p><p>“See, another issue on the whole kid thing,” Rio said, ignoring the warm feeling in her chest that came from the open invitation. “After this week I’m away again.”</p><p>“You are?”</p><p>“In Toronto for about three months. Press in between.”</p><p>Rio saw in Agatha’s gaze such a look of such shock that she thought she was imagining it.</p><p>But it disappeared quickly and Agatha cleared her throat, “See when you have kids you have to pick and choose carefully… I’m shooting in Studio City for around four months, starting in about three weeks.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, her tongue sticking into the inside of her cheek as she watched Agatha’s gaze fall to her wine again.</p><p>“Anything good?” She asked lamely, feeling as though the bubble had burst somehow.</p><p>“It’s just a tv thing. A limited series based on <em>Heartburn</em>.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows, and sat up a little more, “I forgot. I read that you’d got that. I auditioned, you know.”</p><p>“Too young,” Agatha quipped with a grin and tilted her glass to Rio in a pseudo-toast, “That role needs experience.”</p><p>“Ah yes, I always forget I’m talking to an old woman. Tell me, how’re the aches and pains today?”</p><p>“I could run rings around you, Vidal.”</p><p>“I don’t know. Weren’t doing much running earlier.”</p><p>“It’s cute that you think you’re cute.”</p><p>“Making me cute, no?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head to the side and gave Agatha her best grin, placing her hand underneath her chin. Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled and shuffled a little in her seat, “So irritating.”</p><p>“Hey, I just provided an hour’s worth of free childcare for you. <em>And</em> a selfie for your husband. I usually charge for those, you know.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile fell slightly, “Yeah, I’m sorry about that. You didn’t have to.”</p><p>“It’s okay. Happens.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and Rio took the opportunity to take another large sip of wine, deciding she wasn’t drunk enough to be able to hold a proper conversation about Ralph.</p><p>“He is a good dad,” Agatha said suddenly, making Rio almost choke where she’d gone to take another sip.</p><p>“I mean,” Agatha clarified, watching Rio with a slight frown when she was now recovering from her choking by taking another sip of the very thing that had choked her in the first place.</p><p>“He loves Nicky.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure that loving a child was all it took to be a ‘good dad’ but she also wasn’t sure she was in any position to judge, mostly because given the chance she’d insult Ralph for days - whether he deserved it or not.</p><p>“Okay,” she said quietly, unsure how to respond or what Agatha was trying to say.</p><p>Agatha took her own large gulp of her wine and then reached for the bottle to top Rio up again, “Oh. No,” Rio said quickly, coming to her senses just in time to stop Agatha from filling her glass, “I need to drive home. I shouldn’t.”</p><p>“Stay,” Agatha said suddenly, holding the bottle up and raising her gaze to Rio’s, watching her closely.</p><p>And without thinking Rio simply nodded, and removed the hand that hovered over her glass to allow Agatha to refill it.</p><p>When it was done she raised her gaze to meet cautious blue eyes and she took a slow breath in before she said: “This dinner on Friday… this opportunity for a double date plus me… I’m assuming Ralph is coming?”</p><p>Agatha dropped her gaze and nodded as she filled her own glass and put the bottle back in the ice bucket. “Yeah, he’ll be here.”</p><p>Rio nodded too and sat back slowly in her seat, “I’m trying to think of excuses to get out of it.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha asked suddenly, a deep frown marring her features at this news.</p><p>“I’ll be the fifth wheel, I’m not exactly looking forward to sitting with two couples.”</p><p>Maybe the wine had made her say it, and Rio would have been embarrassed but mostly she was just glad she hadn’t said the real truth of it: “I don’t want to see you with Ralph.”</p><p>But Agatha said something next that made Rio worry she’d said the bad part out loud.</p><p>“Then I’ll make sure Ralph’s at the top of the table. You can sit with me.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to ask how this might make a difference but closed it again when Agatha held out her hand to her, making a bridge between the couch and the chair.</p><p>“It’ll be good, I promise.”</p><p>And Agatha wriggled her fingers because Rio was yet to take her hand. And she only didn’t for a few seconds longer because she enjoyed seeing Agatha work for it, her fingers dancing expectantly towards the sky.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll turn up. Maybe without any basketball jerseys this time.”</p><p>She reached across and took Agatha’s hand, smiling when her fingers wrapped around her own.</p><p>“About that…” Agatha said absently, looking down at their joined hands. “I spoke to Nicky whilst you were showering. He’s pretty set on Celtic.”</p><p>“Celtics,” Rio corrected with a raised brow, “Does this mean I’ve lost my jersey?”</p><p>“I’ll buy you another.”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio said with a smirk, “The thing is, I don’t even mind because they’re the best team in the world so I’m glad to have been such a good influence.”</p><p>“If you wanted to have a word with him about bed times and brushing his teeth, that would be good for me too.”</p><p>“I don’t believe that Nicky has any problem with either of those things.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly, her gaze still down on their hands and her thumb now brushing idly in a way that made Rio yearn for her, as pathetic as she was.</p><p>“No, maybe not. I lucked out with him.”</p><p>“I think it’s more than luck,” Rio said kindly, shaking Agatha’s hand gently to try to get her to look up at her, “you must have had some influence in there along the way.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha smiled coyly, raising her gaze to Rio. “Just wanted to hear you say it again.”</p><p>Rio laughed and pulled her hand away suddenly, staring at Agatha in faux-horror, “Fishing for compliments? A woman who gets truck loads every waking hour?”</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha protested, and whether because Rio had taken her hand back or because she was accusing her, she didn’t know. “Parenting compliments are different.”</p><p>“Agatha, who meets that kid and <em>doesn’t</em> compliment your parenting skills?”</p><p>Agatha just rolled her eyes and made a motion with her hand to get Rio to give hers back but Rio wilfully ignored it, deciding it was for her own good more than anything. Because the next time she was over, she certainly wouldn’t be able to hold Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Just doesn’t hurt to hear it, that’s all.”</p><p>Her fingers stopped dancing and she held her palm flat out, reaching for just one more second before she pulled it back in.</p><p>Rio considered this for a second, considered the implications of it, and wondered where it had happened that they were fine with just holding hands whilst talking over wine.</p><p>It was new, for sure. Perhaps it was just a fluke. Perhaps Agatha were drunker than she realised, and maybe she was too.</p><p>Or perhaps, just perhaps, Agatha had missed her, had just been told she potentially wasn’t going to see her again for a few months and… she was making up for lost time.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t let herself do it.</p><p>Agatha had gone silent too and something settled between them that Rio couldn’t name but that made her not want to break it for fear they would have to broach a topic that neither of them were ready for.</p><p>And it was true soon enough, but the peace broke in a way that Rio didn’t mind: the return of Nicky.</p><p>The noise of the boy running to them made Agatha shift in her seat and them both to turn to watch his entrance and Rio had to fight a laugh where he was still wearing his brand new, old Celtics jersey.</p><p>“It’s been an hour,” he announced with a sheepish smile and Rio raised her brows around at Agatha, shocked that this kid would be so honest when he probably could have got away with another few hours playing his games if Rio had anything to do with it.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said with an easy smile, pulling Nicky closer to lean against the couch so she could lean up and kiss his temple, watching Rio from where she now rested her chin on his shoulder.</p><p>“Dinner, then?”</p><p>“Dinner,” Rio and Nicky agreed at the same time and Agatha’s smile widened before she let her son go to chase down to the kitchen.</p><p>Rio stood and smiled at Agatha as she matched her movements, glancing around to check Nicky was gone before she lowered her voice and said: “Whatever you did in a past life to deserve that kid, well done.”</p><p>Agatha only rolled her eyes but Rio saw her proud smile and she laughed as she grabbed the bucket of wine from the table, “You couldn’t be more smug if you tried.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m allowed to be proud of my son.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p><p>Agatha followed Rio down the path, around the pool, and back up to the house. And, once inside, Rio placed the bucket down and leant up against the island in the middle of the grand kitchen.</p><p>“Is there anything I can do to help?”</p><p>“Music duty?” Agatha asked with a thrown smile over her shoulder as she turned the faucet on to wash her hands.</p><p>“Music I can do.”</p><p>Rio pulled out her phone from the tote bag just outside the back door and noticed a few new unread messages but scrolled past them as she went to take a seat beside Nicky at the island.</p><p>“What do you like, kid? Jazz? You seem like a jazz kinda guy.”</p><p>Agatha snorted and Nicky laughed with a scrunch of his nose, “No! Something fun. Rock!”</p><p>“Rock?” Rio asked with an amused smile, scrolling through her playlists until she came across something that would surely do the trick.</p><p>“Okay, Fleetwood Mac it is. Classic. Excellent. Rock.”</p><p>After some fumbling, she connected it to the bluetooth speaker and watched Nicky’s face as the first chords of the guitar kicked in and Lindsey Buckingham’s voice filled the kitchen.</p><p>“You are so cheesy,” Agatha said from the other side of the island where she was chopping garlic.</p><p>“Fleetwood Mac are <em>not</em> cheesy. How dare you.”</p><p>Agatha just rolled her eyes and Rio grinned at her. And something took over suddenly, her desire to show off or her desire to have Agatha’s attention again. Maybe she just wanted Nicky to like her.</p><p>But she slipped from her stool and began to sing along with Lindsey, hamming it up as best she could.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha protested, but Rio had stolen a wooden spoon from the nearby utensils pot and began to belt out the lyrics with abandon.</p><p>“Nicky!” She shouted, gesturing for him to jump up and join and for a second he looked too shy to jump up and do it but then the chorus kicked in and Rio really went for it around a still protesting Agatha.</p><p>“I’ve not had enough wine for this.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio grinned, tugging her arm to pull her from the chopping board and draping her arm around her neck so they were cheek to cheek and Agatha had access to the wooden spoon now masquerading as a mic.</p><p>And Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio, which made Rio’s heart race, and for just a second she’d turned her face around and pressed into Rio’s cheek.</p><p>It made Rio stutter as she sang and she lost all sense of the lyrics for the time Agatha was pressing against her but by the next line it was done and Rio turned to look wide eyed at Agatha, singing as she did: “Open up, everything’s waiting for you…”</p><p>Agatha still had her arms around Rio, resting her hands on her left hip, Rio’s side flush against Agatha’s front.</p><p>And there, in the breath between the verse and the chorus, Rio knew that Alice had been wrong. That ‘happily married’ wasn’t true. That Agatha wanted her maybe as much as she wanted Agatha.</p><p>Her father had been right all those years ago when he’d told her that rock and roll music was the thinking man’s Jesus Christ.</p><p>But Agatha’s lips were moving and she was relenting to the pull of the song and shouting with Rio now into the mic as the chorus kicked up again.</p><p>His mother joining in was all Nicky needed.</p><p>And soon the three of them were bellowing “YOU CAN GO YOUR OWN WAY” into the mic, Rio making sure everyone got equal opportunities to share the spoon.</p><p>Agatha was now only holding onto her with one arm, her other had pulled Nicky into the fold and Rio felt sick with it, sick with the ease in which the three of them huddled together and sung their hearts out.</p><p>This borrowed little family for the night was all it would ever be.</p><p>Even if Agatha might want her too. Even if she continued to hold her hand and touch her leg.</p><p>This wasn’t hers to keep.</p><p>As the first guitar solo kicked in, Rio’s rational mind overtook and she pulled away to give herself over to the sacred art of air guiltar.</p><p>Agatha was unwilling to join in so two guitarists would have to do.</p><p>Her and Nicky tore it up around her and Rio felt the familiar flush of an adoring audience admiring her, though this particular audience was made of just one.</p><p>“I hate theatre kids,” Agatha mumbled as she fell back against the counter and laughed at the sight before her, shaking her head in disbelief as the song drew to a close and Rio was back on her again, mic at the ready.</p><p>“No, not again!”</p><p>“You can go your own way!” Both Rio and Nicky sang, both grabbing at Agatha who now had two maniacs in her arms once more.</p><p>Rio was laughing too much for the next guitar solo and Nicky fully went for it, throwing his long hair about the place that Rio had to applaud him as he did so, trying to ignore that Agatha had draped her arms around her middle and was laughing into her shoulder.</p><p>But she leant back into it, her mic-less hand resting above Agatha’s, and the only thing that could break them apart, would ever make Rio pull away from being held like this, was Nicky as he finished the song with a fist in the air and a brilliant, proud grin.</p><p>Agatha squeezed Rio’s middle and then moved around her to place a firm kiss to her son’s pink cheeks and beamed down at him.</p><p>“My little rockstar.”</p><p>Rio grinned as she leant against the island and caught her breath, horrified that she could be so out of it after just one song when she’d been more than capable of running around the basketball court for an hour in the hot sun earlier.</p><p><em>Wine</em>, she thought idly, but her gaze drifted across to Agatha and she wondered if she was another reason she felt breathless.</p><p>She chewed on her lip to stop herself from getting carried away again with thoughts that would send her over the cliff edge until she felt a hand on her stomach and she looked up just as Agatha kissed her cheek sweetly.</p><p>“Goofy,” she whispered close to Rio’s ear and grinned at her as she pulled away, her hand moving round to the safety of Rio’s side when Nicky moved back around again and jumped on the stool.</p><p>“We should do that before dinner every night.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks were now flushed for a different reason but she turned around to smile at Nicky and raised her brows, feeling a soft touch at the small of her back before Agatha pulled away entirely to focus back in on the meal prep.</p><p>“I think your mom would love that. You can pick a different song every night and sing it together.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha muttered quietly, and Rio turned to raise her brows at Agatha, challenging her to it.</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“I can kick you out, you know.”</p><p>“But you won’t,” Rio grinned, turning where she stood to lean her back on the counter again, and reaching across Agatha to get her wine.</p><p>Agatha only huffed but returned to her meal prep, occasionally adding to the conversation where Rio and Nicky mostly spoke about basketball and occasionally soccer.</p><p>By the time dinner was made, a prawn linguine, with chilli on the side so Nicky didn’t have to have it, and it was presented in a large bowl in the middle of the table in the breakfast nook, Rio had decided that Nicky was the best kid she’d ever met.</p><p>And Agatha, well she knew how she felt about Agatha.</p><p>And sitting here, at the little table with her son, half a bottle of wine in her system, and Agatha’s knee every so often knocking into her own, was enough to confirm it.</p><p>It hadn’t been this a silly vacation one-sided infatuation. She’d fallen for hypnotic blue eyes and soft, secret touches. She’d fallen for Agatha Harkness, totally and utterly, and she now believed, despite Alice’s voice ringing in her ears, that Agatha might have fallen too.</p><p>Rio couldn’t quite wrap her head around the fact that in her place, on any given night, Ralph would be sitting here, as close to Agatha as she were, more than likely closer.</p><p>But Agatha’s touches were getting bolder, always hidden from Nicky’s sights.</p><p>The knee that had been previously just brushing her own was now pressed against it.</p><p>Her hand, when she placed her fork down and declared she was so full she couldn’t eat anything else, not even ice cream(!), had slipped below the table and was resting so her fingertips were on Rio’s thigh.</p><p>The pull of Agatha was too much to resist and Rio wondered if this was going where she hoped it might be.</p><p>But the presence of Nicky, the reminder that this was a family unit she were intruding on, made her hesitate with every return of Agatha’s touches.</p><p>Soon enough dinner was over and Agatha told Nicky he could put the dishes away tomorrow because his performance earlier had been so excellent and Rio was hovering by the island again, cradling her wine as Agatha wrapped up the leftovers when Nicky asked:</p><p>“Mom can we watch a movie?”</p><p>Rio raised a brow and smiled a little at Agatha who for a second looked disappointed and Rio wondered if she’d had other ideas in mind for what to do with their evening together but the question was soon thrown her way and Rio had no choice but to answer in the affirmative.</p><p>“I think you should ask our guest, don’t you?”</p><p>“Rio? I’ll let you pick.”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and turning her attention to Nicky again, she didn’t refuse.</p><p>So the little trio went to a room Agatha referred to as “the den” and Rio rolled her eyes at what was basically a library-cum-cinema room. Then again, twenty million a picture she supposed could buy whatever Agatha wanted.</p><p>Agatha came good on her promise of ice cream for Nicky and even brought a bowl for Rio, much to Rio’s secret delight.</p><p>And the three of them piled onto the huge, soft couch, with Agatha in the middle.</p><p>“Okay,” she said with a smirk, wriggling the control in Rio’s face, “What would Her Majesty like?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, leaning across to place her wine down so she could tuck her legs back up and focus on her ice cream.</p><p>“Have you ever seen <em>E.T.</em>, Nicky?”</p><p>“Of course he has,” Agatha said, her tone full of so much offence that Rio grinned at her.</p><p>“I love it,” Nicky piped up helpfully and Rio shrugged.</p><p>“Then <em>E.T. it is.</em>”</p><p>Agatha grumbled something about being called an “unfit mother” and Rio only laughed as she watched the large screen bring the movie up and the lights begin to dim.</p><p>“This place is ridiculous,” she whispered softly, shooting Agatha a look of immense amusement as she slipped down and slapped at Rio’s arm.</p><p>By the time the titles were done, Rio had finished her ice cream and placed the bowl quietly on the side, turning to see Nicky had finished his and was tucked under his mother’s arm.</p><p>The sight made her grin so much that Agatha caught her eye and raised a brow in question at Rio’s grin.</p><p>“Cute,” Rio breathed, motioning to Nicky before settling back down on the couch.</p><p>Ten minutes later and Rio’s attention on the movie waned somewhat as Agatha’s hand had moved on top of her own thigh.</p><p>Rio glanced down at it, seeing her fingers twitch towards her slightly and she felt a jolt in her stomach at the silent request.</p><p>Was it a request?</p><p>She couldn’t take her hand. Nicky would see. But Agatha wanted something and Rio thought about it for a second (actually a few minutes) before she casually placed her hand down on the couch between them, waiting patiently for Agatha to make her move.</p><p>She did, not two minutes later, placing her hand carefully beside Rio’s and turning it so just their knuckles could brush.</p><p>And Rio realised again then that all the months of second-guessing her own feelings, of being so sure about Agatha’s lack of, they’d all be wrong.</p><p>Agatha wanted this, wanted her.</p><p>And Rio couldn’t believe that she’d missed it, that she’d convinced herself of the old lie: “happily married”.</p><p>Because Agatha may have said it, but she’d been telling her all along that she wanted her.</p><p>Agatha’s forefinger moved to stretch and brush backwards over the side of Rio’s and Rio felt her mind go blank with her desire to simply take Agatha’s hand and hold it firmly in her own.</p><p>She wanted, needed, Agatha to send Nicky to bed, so she would be able to turn to her and tell her she wanted her, that this was it.</p><p>But as the movie went on and their fingers continued to brush occasionally but never moved beyond it.</p><p>Rio knew that Agatha would have to be the one to make the move.</p><p>She couldn’t force it. Couldn’t make Agatha do something that she clearly wasn’t ready to commit to, maybe even to face about herself.</p><p>But it was okay, Rio thought with as much conviction as she had in her, because she could wait for her to be ready, and if it took longer, if it took forever, then so be it.</p><p>In years to come people could make a tragic movie about their lives and how their first kiss was their last kiss.</p><p>God, Rio thought suddenly, she <em>was</em> pathetic.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha’s voice broke her from her spiralling thoughts of deathbed confessions and weeping at funerals and Rio turned sharply to look at Agatha, frowning a little in the darkness.</p><p>“Honey. There’s a pile of blankets below the table. Will you grab a couple?”</p><p>Rio nodded and reached down carefully to find what Agatha was talking about and pulled two blankets out. She held one in her lap as she leant across, blocking Agatha’s view briefly as she draped one over Nicky where he half lay against Agatha still.</p><p>He smiled at her and she smiled back, shooting Agatha a quick look before she settled back down and draped the other blanket over their laps.</p><p>Nothing happened for a while, Rio having already made the choice that death bed was the way to go. But then, she felt it, a gentle tug against the side of her thigh, a soft request for Rio’s hand below the blanket again.</p><p>Rio ignored it for a while because she had to temper the aching in her chest.</p><p>Agatha was right beside her, their shoulders almost touching, and now she was asking for her hand.</p><p>After a few seconds of not moving she felt Agatha’s touch relax against the fabric of her pants and then her hand moved away and Rio closed her eyes as she took a deep breath in, steadying herself before she did the inevitable.</p><p>She reached slowly beneath the blanket and found Agatha’s hand now back in her own lap and brushed her fingers subtly along the back of it.</p><p>From the corner of her eye she caught Agatha turn slightly to look at her but Rio was distracted by her hand moving back down with Rio’s silent request and as Rio cleared her throat - and old childhood belief that noise would distract from something only visual - she slipped her arm beneath Agatha’s and entwined their fingers.</p><p>Her chest flared with want but she fought it down and focused instead on what she did have, which was Agatha willingly holding her hand.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her in response and Rio shuffled until she was pressing as much of herself to Agatha as she dared with an awake Nicky so close.</p><p>If she could extract herself from her own body, walk in here and see the sight before her, she might think it were a little family, just having a casual movie night. She might think one of the woman looked so delighted to be there and the other looked calm.</p><p>Her gaze might fall to Nicky and she would consider him to be warm and comfortable and loved.</p><p>And she might even pine for what she was seeing, might even consider it to be out of her reach, might not even be able to recognise that whilst it may be something she couldn’t truly have, she could have it for tonight, and maybe that would be enough.</p><p>Rio held Agatha’s hand for the rest of the movie, and every so often Agatha squeezed her or brushed her thumb over the back of Rio’s hand, until the credits rolled and Agatha made a move to nudge a sleepy Nicky from where he’d tucked himself in.</p><p>“Bed time, I think.”</p><p>Nicky didn’t protest but Rio almost did because Agatha moving meant that she had to release her hold on her hand.</p><p>But she did and Agatha turned her hand over to squeeze her thigh before she pulled away entirely, whispering to Nicky as they both stood, “Say goodnight to Rio.”</p><p>Nicky smiled and leant in to hug Rio, and Rio readily returned it, giving him a gentle squeeze before releasing him back to Agatha.</p><p>“I’ll be right back.”</p>

<p><em>”I’ll be right back.”</em></p><p>Something in Agatha’s gaze made Rio suddenly feel nervous, as if she were suddenly expected to know what to do next, as if this whole thing hadn’t been confusing and painful but energising and exciting.</p><p>So Rio sat on the couch, toying with the blanket across her lap. She finished the now-warm wine that was in her glass and spent the rest of the time wondering what would happen when Agatha arrived back.</p><p>But she didn’t have to wait too long. Agatha was back within twenty minutes.</p><p>She paused in the door and asked: “Would you like more wine?”</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>So two more minutes later and Agatha was back beside her, pouring them both more wine before she turned to Rio properly, offering her glass back to her so they could cheers.</p><p>Their eyes met over the rim of the glasses and Rio felt her stomach flip because how had she missed it before? Agatha wasn’t looking at her any differently than she usually would. Only now, she knew what that look meant.</p><p>“Nicky’s keen for dinner dancing to be a thing now, I hope you know.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little, relaxing at the memory as she watched Agatha shift her weight, wrestle with the blankets below her until she could slip under them and Rio felt a rush of warmth as Agatha’s knees knocked hers lightly and she tried to play it cool by placing her elbow up on the back of the couch pretending none of this was affecting her.</p><p>But she wasn’t that good an actress.</p><p>Or maybe it was just affecting her that much.</p><p>“You’re welcome for that,” Rio managed to get out, choosing a good way through this was to drink more wine, so she did.</p><p>“Are you offering to come over every night for pre-dinner entertainment?”</p><p>Rio swallowed down the mouthful of wine thickly and watched Agatha’s gaze drop to where her throat bobbed.</p><p>“For you or Nicky?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze snapped back up suddenly and Rio felt dizzy all of a sudden, because Agatha’s pupils were blown and her lips were parted and she’d moved a fraction of an inch closer, her knees now either side of Rio’s right knee on the couch.</p><p>“Both?” Agatha tried and Rio wondered if she were trying to rein it in again, trying to calm the rising tide of tension between them.</p><p>“I would if I could,” Rio said truthfully, trying to calm her heart from racing away with itself.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze had dropped again and she turned away slightly from Rio, and Rio knew her decision earlier had been right.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t ready.</p><p>She reached for her hand and tugged it until Agatha turned back to face her, a slight furrow in her brow as she did.</p><p>“I’m going to get an uber home. I don’t think I should stay tonight.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said quickly, giving herself away in her urgency, “I’d like you to stay. Please?”</p><p>And Rio knew Agatha wouldn’t ask if she didn’t mean it so she nodded and squeezed Agatha’s hand gently, dropping her gaze to it.</p><p>“I was thinking about Friday dinner during the movie,” Agatha said slowly, clearly thinking her next words over cautiously, “Ralph will be at work until just before everyone arrives and Nicky will be away at a friend’s after school so maybe you could come over earlier?”</p><p>Rio raised her gaze slowly to Agatha’s, seeing the way her eyes darted about her face, the way her cheeks were suddenly a little flushed, the way her eyes dropped to her lips when Rio parted them and Rio wanted to scream at Agatha to kiss her.</p><p>She wanted to tell her how badly she wanted her, to make her see sense, to make her understand how desperate Rio felt whenever she was near her.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>She nodded and squeezed Agatha’s hand, “I’d like that.”</p><p>“See?” Agatha asked with a small smile, “Pre-dinner entertainment.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but smiled widely and it was then that it happened.</p><p>Rio’s mouth was open with a retort on the tip of her tongue when Agatha had pressed her lips to her own.</p><p>Rio’s lips responded immediately, closing around Agatha’s soft top lip where Agatha’s enveloped her lower own. She applied just enough pressure to let Agatha know she wanted it.</p><p>Agatha gasped softly as she pulled away, her forehead pressing against Rio’s and her fingers untangling from where Rio still held them so she could lift her hand and hold Rio’s cheek in place, her thumb moving to brush reverently over the corner of Rio’s upper lip.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she whispered gently, “I… maybe I’ve had too much wine.”</p><p>Rio felt dizzy, felt unsure if this were real or not or if she’d fallen asleep during the movie and were now imagining the soft breath of Agatha Harkness against her parted lips. But Agatha had already ducked her head again and was kissing her once more, and Rio responded.</p><p>This kiss was longer, and Rio’s lips moved against Agatha’s as if they’d been doing this for years.</p><p>Agatha’s hold on her cheek changed as she pushed her hand around to grasp the back of Rio’s head, pressing her desperately closer as she moved her tongue to brush her lower lip for the permission that Rio so easily granted.</p><p>She’d imagined this a million times over. She’d envisioned Agatha kissing her and yet none of it could compare. Agatha tasted like the Italian wine she’d been drinking all evening, only more delicious, but the tang of the grape was softened by the warmth of her, tender and unexpected on a night where Rio had thought the best she could get was the hold of her hand.</p><p>Rio met Agatha’s tongue with her own and a moan that other women would have had to work for, that she gave to Agatha without thinking. And Agatha responded in kind, sending shockwaves of want through Rio’s body that made her pull away suddenly.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped open and she looked panicked as Rio pulled away, her breathing uneven and heavy and her eyes wide as she stared across at Agatha.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha said quickly, turning and wrestling with the blanket until she was out from under it.</p><p>Rio didn’t stop her as she moved a foot or so away on the couch. She just watched. Unable to calm her racing heart as she stared at the woman now placing her wine glass down, now raising her hand to her lips, now running her other hand through her hair, now scrunching it with her fingers, now swallowing and saying: “I shouldn’t have done that.”</p><p>And Rio felt insane with it because all she wanted to do was to pull Agatha back and tell her she <em>should</em> have done it and they <em>should</em> keep doing it but her mind couldn’t pass the message to her petrified body.</p><p>In another world, Rio would be strong with it.</p><p>She’d take charge and win the war with her own feelings and tell Agatha that it was okay and that they were both a little drunk and that maybe playing happy families together for an evening was confusing for them both. And then she’d go home and they’d see each other at the next industry event.</p><p>But Rio already felt herself losing the war of rational thinking. She was placing her wine down, throwing the blanket from her lap, moving closer to Agatha again.</p><p>“It’s okay.”</p><p>“It’s not,” Agatha snapped quickly, her words laced with a panic that Rio recognised as fear.</p><p>She reached for her slowly, just tentatively holding her arm.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move away.</p><p>“Agatha. Tell me how you’re feeling.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s arm shift slightly as if she were to pull it away but a second later she was turning around and Rio’s heart stuttered in her chest at the sight of her soft expression, her gentle gaze.</p><p>“I don’t really want to talk.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only watch Agatha with an equally gentle gaze though her fingers flexed on her arm and her body shifted a little closer.</p><p>Rio’s breathing was already heavy, and her body felt like it was on fire, but she moved slowly, forcing herself to be mindful of the delicate situation they were in, of the gentle understanding that they were doing something that could result in a lot of people getting very hurt.</p><p>So she moved cautiously, applying pressure to Agatha’s arm until she sat back properly aware of what she might be asking.</p><p>She shifted closer. She moved to push Agatha back against the couch, and then swung around to sit above her, straddling her and raising her hands to hold her face up to her, threading her fingers into her hair as she did.</p><p>It was a bad decision. She already knew that.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hands settle on her hips and she shifted just an inch or two closer, but no more.</p><p>She had to take control. Had to force herself to go slow for fear they’d burn too bright and too hot and their fire would spark out before it had even begun.</p><p>“I don’t,” she started quietly, unable to help it as her fingers threaded through dark hair. “I don’t sleep with married women.”</p><p>“Okay, okay, I know. Okay,” Agatha breathed quietly, and Rio dropped her gaze to her lips, watching them part, watching her tongue slip out and wet her lower one.</p><p>And Agatha’s gentle reassurance was all she needed to know that her rule would be broken.</p><p>That she’d break it for Agatha. If Agatha wanted her to.</p><p>“Are you sure?” She asked nervously, her hands moving back and her thumbs brushing softly over Agatha’s cheekbones as she stared down into eyes that were so dark, she could barely see any blue left.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha sighed softly, her hands slipping beneath her borrowed sweater to hold her sides. “I want this. I want you.”</p><p>That was all Rio needed to hear.</p><p>She closed the distance without a second’s thought, and soon Rio was moaning again, the months of buildup making her more desperate than she’d ever been for anyone.</p><p>And Agatha was bold, bolder than Rio thought she’d be. She was forceful in her touches, in her tongue as it pressed against Rio’s and caused her to rock her hips against nothing.</p><p>But Agatha felt the movement and the hands that had been just a breath away from her breasts were suddenly back at her hips, suddenly Agatha was leaning upwards, suddenly Rio was pulled and pressed and held and when she rocked again, she rocked against Agatha’s abs, and she saw stars as Agatha moaned into her mouth and gripped her so tightly she thought she’d collapse into her from the sheer magnitude of her desire.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t breathe anymore, and she had to pull away to catch her breath, even as she did, Agatha, panting just as much, chased her lips and kissed them again and again, only leaving breaths between so they could both breathe properly.</p><p>And Rio grinned into it, her eyes fluttering open to see the mess she’d made of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“I’ve been going crazy with it,” she admitted softly, even as Agatha continued to try to kiss her, reluctant to be parted as her hands squeezed and stroked and scratched all over her abdomen.</p><p>“I thought… I thought I was…” but she could barely get her words out because Agatha was so insistent, “going crazy… that I was… imagining things because… because I wanted you… so badly…”</p><p>Agatha groaned a little, and Rio rewarded her patience in allowing her to speak by capturing her lips again properly, and biting down gently on her lower one, allowing her hips to rock slowly.</p><p>“Rio, don’t,” Agatha suddenly breathed out, her voice deeper than Rio had ever heard it, breathier than should be allowed as she’d pulled away.</p><p>“I can’t,” she began to explain softly, and Rio had to fight her own groan, her own desire to seduce Agatha into changing her mind as she felt her hand move slowly up her sternum, resting between her breasts and splaying her fingers out.</p><p>It was too close, too tantalising, but she couldn’t make Agatha take her hand away.</p><p>She’d waited so long, and if this was all Agatha could give her, then that’s what she’d take.</p><p>“Nicky’s only upstairs I-…”</p><p>But Rio understood that. And so she forced herself to calm down, to take deep breaths and to rest her forehead against Agatha’s, closing her eyes as she focused on her breathing.</p><p>Agatha’s hands slowly moved back down and she held her at her hips gently, tracing slow circles there with her thumbs.</p><p>“You don’t know how badly I want you. I haven’t been able to think about anything else.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, and when she thought she could handle it, she made to move off of Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said suddenly, her gentle hold going back to firm again as she held onto her, “No, just… stay. Just for a little while longer.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio whispered softly, taking the opportunity to duck down and kiss Agatha again, hoping although they couldn’t go any further, at least kissing might be okay.</p><p>And Agatha kissed her back, so Rio leant into it once more, breaking the kiss only when she felt like she might lose control and try to push again.</p><p>Agatha was firm and urgent but she was also inexperienced and had a sleeping child upstairs so Rio had to be cautious. She had to be considerate.</p><p>Though her body was screaming at her to do more, to make Agatha touch her more.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said quietly, after five more minutes of allowing her to hold her, of soft kissed exchanged, “I’m going to get off now, okay? I can’t… I need to move away a little.”</p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened briefly but then she released her and slipped her hands from beneath her shirt so Rio could slip from her and slide down onto the couch beside her.</p><p>She tucked her legs beneath her and bit down on her lip as Agatha adjusted her position to look at Rio, her lips as swollen as Rio’s must be, and her cheeks just as flushed.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>Rio asked cautiously, unsure whether it was a good idea to even ask.</p><p>But she reached out to take Agatha’s hand and Agatha allowed it, watching as Rio kissed each finger in turn and then slowly turned her hand to kiss her palm and Rio held her hand there when she saw tears forming in Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>Rio pressed back in slowly, moving to manoeuvre them so Agatha would wrap her arms around her and she could do the same.</p><p>“Hey,” she dropped her voice to barely a whisper as she saw the first tear drop and she kissed it away gently against Agatha’s cheek, “it’s okay. I’m sorry, it’s okay.”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t say anything else and simply turned her head to kiss Rio again, and Rio knew she wasn’t ready. And that she’d wait a lifetime for her to be so.</p><p>A slight nausea rose in Rio’s stomach then. A gentle wave of horror that seemingly came from nowhere but that promise more; a tidal wave of guilt. But she sucked it up because Agatha was hurting and needed her in that moment.</p><p>She dropped her hold of Agatha’s cheek and moved her hand instead to wrestle with the collar of her sweater, twisting it slowly in her hand before she leant in and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s lips.</p><p>It was meant to be gentle. To be reassuring.</p><p>Rio wanted Agatha to know that she had her, that she would have her, that she’d go to her grave with the secret of Agatha Harkness wanting to kiss her.</p><p>But just like that, the dam burst and Agatha was kissing her properly again, pushing up and over Rio to get her onto her back.</p><p>They broke apart when Rio’s back hit the seat cushions and Agatha was left gasping above her, looking wilder than Rio had ever seen her.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and shifted a little to get more comfortable, watching the way Agatha reacted when she pushed her hands just beneath her sweater to caress the warm skin there.</p><p>It didn’t make sense. That Agatha could be so vulnerable and then so adamant within minutes. But she couldn’t think straight. Not with Agatha now leaning above her. Not with her looking at her like that.</p><p>“You look so beautiful,” Rio murmured, unable to help herself when she had a goddess leaning over her.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched a little and she pulled slowly back, shifting from her position on all fours to rest back on her ankles over Rio’s thighs. Rio’s hold dropped from her and she raised herself up on her elbows to watch Agatha, seeing her wrestle with her self.</p><p>“Tell me what you need.”</p><p>And she watched as Agatha reached to grab Rio’s collar, tugging for only a second before Rio raised herself up and wrapped her arms snuggly around Agatha’s hips. Agatha’s hands cupped Rio’s face and she frowned as she stared down at her lips, clearly considering what it was she needed, or would allow herself to have.</p><p>“I need you inside of me.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth opened and she felt Agatha’s words travel directly to between her thighs as she shifted slightly beneath her, watching cautiously for any signs that Agatha might change her mind.</p><p>But she didn’t. She hadn’t.</p><p>Agatha only leant in and kissed her again, tilting her head up so she could curl her tongue inside Rio’s mouth once more and make her moan the way she had before.</p><p>She felt fragile below Agatha, terrified she’d do something wrong, that Agatha would pull away, and she’d shatter into a million pieces.</p><p>But Agatha was apparently unaware of Rio’s fragility because she had taken her lower lip and sucked on it, making Rio groan quietly as she moved her hands to Agatha’s hips and pressed them down and into her.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha husked as she released her lip and traced along it with her tongue, “touch me.”</p><p>Mute and needy, Rio reached between them, keeping her eyes up on Agatha as she turned her hand over and slipped her hand beneath her sweater, sliding past the waistband of her pants until she was cupping Agatha through her underwear.</p><p>Rio swallowed.</p><p>She was soaked.</p><p>Agatha made a soft noise and rocked her hips down against Rio’s hand and Rio marvelled at the sight of it, at Agatha above her, her face twisted in desperate concentration as she rocked again and again.</p><p>“Rio, please.”</p><p>Rio didn’t need told a third time.</p><p>Because Agatha was as desperate as she felt.</p><p>She bit down on her lip to prevent herself from moaning as she slid her hand up again, pressing her fingers below the soft fabric of Agatha’s underwear, until she brushed over a patch of damp hair and down further.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t shy about moving against her, about rocking her hips, and Rio could barely keep it together as she scissored two fingers either side of Agatha’s swollen clit and began to move back and forth, applying just the slightest pressure.</p><p>“F-fuck, fuck.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed as Rio continued to tease her, her hand already slippery wet as she pressed deeper to tease around Agatha’s entrance.</p><p>She was needy, that much she could tell. Her hips still rolled with every stroke and touch of Rio’s fingers and Rio grunted quietly as she felt the small entrance flutter as she pressed the tips of her two fingers into Agatha.</p><p>The reaction was immediate, where Agatha had been sitting tall above her, her back arched and her eyes still closed, she now bent inwards, clutching at Rio’s shirt and hair, her face pressing into her neck as she murmured her name over and over.</p><p>And Rio rewarded her by pressing her fingers fully inside, feeling the blessed tightness around them, the squeeze of Agatha as she adjusted and rocked into her once more.</p><p>And then Agatha’s lips were pressing against her pulse point and Rio moaned quietly as she twisted her hand a little, wincing at the angle with Agatha now pressed impossibly against her but how could she stop when fucking Agatha like this was all she’d been able to think about.</p><p>Agatha was pressing sloppy, desperate kisses to Rio’s neck, her jaw, her lips.</p><p>And it was as Rio tasted Agatha’s tongue again that the woman above her released a heavy moan into her mouth and Rio felt her clench around her as her orgasm crashed over her.</p><p>It had taken less than two minutes, and Rio didn’t know whether Agatha was just sensitive or if she could feel smug that she’d been so responsive to her.</p><p>The idea that it was the latter made Rio feel insane with desire.</p><p>Rio curled her fingers inwards, pressing her palm still firmly over Agatha’s clit and allowed her to rock her hips slowly still, riding the orgasm out.</p><p>Agatha pulled away from Rio’s lips only for a second before she began to kiss them again, one kiss for every rock of her hips.</p><p>“Was that,” Rio asked cautiously, nervous now even as Agatha continued to press soft kisses to her, “okay?”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered as she brushed their lips together again, her hips stuttering, “baby.”</p><p>Rio gasped quietly and Agatha smiled a little, catching the noise against her lips as she reached down between them to hold Rio’s wrist and Rio knew what it meant, so she pulled out slowly, watching as Agatha whined a little and moved her hand to rest delicately on her clothed hip.</p><p>“I’d keep your fingers there all night if I could,” Agatha said softly, brushing their noses together.</p><p>“I wouldn’t object,” Rio murmured, knowing already that she’d live inside of Agatha if she could.</p><p>Agatha smiled against her lips and Rio smiled right back, feeling the glow of Agatha’s attention warming her from inside out.</p><p>“I want to touch you first, okay?”</p><p>“You don’t have to.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, a little firmer than before as she pulled back a little and moved her hand to Rio’s jaw, holding it firmly between her fingers and thumb, “second only to you being inside me, I want nothing more than to fuck you, okay?”</p><p>Rio could only nod, so harsh was the hold Agatha had on her that she couldn’t speak.</p><p>She let Agatha guide her onto her back and whimpered a little when she brushed her lips over her throat, her tongue flicking out as she shifted and Rio felt the telltale movements of a hand slipping below her underwear.</p><p>“It’s… it’s different than being with a man,” she said quietly, her mind a blissful blank even as she tried to give some reassurance, knowing Agatha hadn’t done this before.</p><p>Agatha just hummed, “no shit.”</p><p>Rio groaned a little when she felt Agatha’s fingers toy with the little hairs at the apex of her pussy, managing only just to keep her hips still.</p><p>“It’s more delicate… more-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned quietly as she lifted her head up to gaze down at her, at the same time sliding her fingers down to press where Rio so desperately wanted her.</p><p>“If you keep trying to talk me through it I will stop. Do you want me to stop?”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows as she pressed her middle finger against her, brushing length ways through her soaked centre, just grazing her clit with every pull upwards.</p><p>“N-no. Don’t stop.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said with a dark glint in her eyes, her pupils making her usually bright blue eyes look practically black.</p><p>“Are you usually this wet?”</p><p>Agatha asked curiously and Rio blushed as she felt Agatha dip lower in her explorations of her, “No,” she managed to croak, “all for you.”</p><p>Rio felt herself slip further and further from her rational mind as Agatha smirked down at her and she lost herself completely when Agatha thrust into her with a suddenness that made Rio shout out a moan.</p><p>Above her, Agatha adjusted herself, leaning up on her knees slightly so she could place a hand over Rio’s mouth. Agatha was firm against her, and the movements of her left hand were harsher than Rio had been with her but the addition of her palm covering her mouth made Rio clutch at Agatha’s sweater, clawing at her as Agatha fucked her, maintaining eye contact the whole time.</p><p>Rio grunted and groaned beneath Agatha, and her eyes almost rolled into the back of her head when Agatha managed to twist her hand, fumbling for only a few seconds before she found Rio’s clit.</p><p>The woman was a virtuoso.</p><p>Rio’s whole body was attuned to everything that Agatha was giving her and Rio didn’t have the capacity of mind to try to understand whether it was because it was Agatha touching her or whether Agatha was already just that good.</p><p>But she came with a muffled cry, her whole body arching off the couch and causing Agatha to gape at her, her eyes wide at the state she’d made of Rio Vidal.</p><p>She didn’t stop the movements of her hand even when Rio began to whine softly, her hand moving up to take Agatha’s away from her hot, wet mouth.</p><p>“You… stop, Agatha. It’s too much.”</p><p>Agatha nodded a little, reducing her movements to a standstill but not moving her hand away.</p><p>She stared at Rio in amazement for a little while before she leant down and kissed her slowly, her fingers twitching inside of her when Rio met her tongue with her own.</p><p>It was a lazy kiss, a kiss between two people who had all the time in the world, and Rio only huffed when Agatha pulled back, and her hand slowly pulled away from her, brushing soft strokes through her soaked folds before she slipped it back out and rested it around her hip.</p><p>“For a first time that was…”</p><p>But Agatha was smiling and Rio lost her train of thought as she grinned up at her, “you’re incredible.”</p><p>Agatha huffed out a soft laugh and kissed Rio sweetly on the nose, lowering her body cautiously so she could lie on top of her.</p><p>“I want a whole day with you. Twenty four hours of…” Agatha bit her lip as she shifted to rest herself down properly, pressing her face in against Rio’s neck and sliding her damp hand below her shirt to sit at her hip.</p><p>“Just this. Just you. Naked.”</p><p>She kissed Rio’s neck and Rio hummed from deep within her throat, before she released a gentle laugh at the absurdity of it all.</p><p>“You mean instead of a quick fuck on the couch of your cinema room?”</p><p>Agatha pressed her face closer then, and Rio gasped quietly as she nipped lightly at her skin, “More than twenty four hours. A week.”</p><p>“A week of just this?”</p><p>“Just us.”</p><p>The promise settled in a part of Rio’s brain that made her shiver slightly, and Agatha felt it against her, and moved her hand up her side until it could curl around her ribs just below her breast.</p><p>They were silent for a while and Rio felt the soft comfort of just having someone close for a while, of having Agatha close, a woman she’d craved and yearned for for weeks.</p><p>A woman who, was now pressed as close as she could be and was pressing soft kisses to Rio’s throat every so often, allowing her lips to graze there and her nose to brush along it as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Rio’s hold around Agatha tightened slightly every time she did this and she relaxed so much that she began to drift away, feeling safe and more content than she had in weeks.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Her whispered name jolted her back awake and Rio blinked into the dim light to see Agatha hovering above her, a slightly amused smile on her face.</p><p>“You were snoring, honey.”</p><p>“I… I wasn’t.”</p><p>“Yes you were,” Agatha grinned, pressing a kiss to Rio’s pouting lips.</p><p>“It’s okay. It was soft. It was sweet.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and huffed as Agatha squeezed her waist and continued to grin at her, “Did I tire you out?”</p><p>“Oh shut up,” Rio said with an exaggerated scowl as Agatha laughed and stole a quick kiss, “one orgasm is not enough to tire me out.”</p><p>“Is that right?”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes as Agatha beamed at her, and Rio briefly forgot what she was arguing about as she did.</p><p>“Would two orgasms tire you out?” Agatha asked innocently, her brows raising as if she’d asked nothing more innocent than ‘how are you feeling today?’.</p><p>But Rio could feel the want in Agatha voice and body.</p><p>Her eyes were darker again, her fingers curled tightly across her rib cage and her thumb making small moves towards the underside of her breast.</p><p>“I’m sure I could handle it.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and began to move her hand back down but Rio caught it just as it moved to her lower abdomen and Agatha raised her brows in question.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You’re a quick study.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows raised further and she wriggled her fingers in Rio’s hold, “Then let go and let me study some more.”</p><p>But Rio didn’t let up and she watched Agatha with a growing smirk, beginning to see the impatience slip in, “I’m the first woman you’ve been with?”</p><p>“You know that.”</p><p>“How did it feel?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched again and Rio’s smirk only grew some more as Agatha remained silent above her, “Didn’t the fact that I came so quickly tell you all you needed to know?”</p><p>“You liked it,” Rio concluded with a raised brow but Agatha had clearly had enough teasing and forcibly pulled her hand away from Rio’s clutches.</p><p>“You,” she said with a sneer as Rio grinned.</p><p>“Are,” she emphasised as she leant up on her knees and took hold of Rio’s wrists.</p><p>“Incredibly,” she pinned them above her head.</p><p>“Annoying.”</p><p>Rio only beamed up at Agatha, her cheeks giving away her reaction to this sudden show of dominance.</p><p>She let them sit in it for a second, watching as Agatha’s lips parted and she shifted above her, straddling her hips but not close enough that even as Rio arched her back she could reach her.</p><p>“Holding me like this won’t get you anywhere,” she warned with a lick of her lips.</p><p>Agatha’s brow twitched a little and she seemed to be weighing her options as she stared down between them.</p><p>“A week wouldn’t be enough,” she concluded, making Rio’s brows shoot up and her grin to return.</p><p>“No? How long, Agatha? How long would you need to have me all to yourself before you were satisfied?”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t respond with her words.</p><p>She moved her right hand down to Rio’s throat, brushing the sides with her fingers gently before she trailed further down, her fingers brushing across her left breast over her sweater.</p><p>Rio moaned quietly, arching her chest up for more.</p><p>Blue eyes flashed to large brown ones and Agatha moved her hand down further until she could slide it beneath her borrowed sweater, returning her hand to her breast properly, and gasping as she finally made contact and groped at it with a firm and desperate touch.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warned quietly, rocking her hips after a particularly harsh squeeze, “stop teasing.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and raised her brows as she pinched Rio’s nipple to elicit a soft moan from the woman beneath her.</p><p>“You’re so responsive.”</p><p>Rio just groaned, knowing that meant Agatha wouldn’t be giving in any time soon.</p><p>And sure enough, Agatha shifted down, releasing her hold on her wrists to press her face back in against Rio’s neck, her soft kisses now becoming firm and hungry and Rio tried to rock into her again, regretting bitterly that she’d stopped Agatha’s hand earlier.</p><p>“Agatha,” she tried to plead as the older woman above her pulled her hand away from her breast and moved it to push her sweater up, moving down enough that as she gathered it at Rio’s throat she could hover just a few inches above her breasts.</p><p>Rio had never done nudity in her films. So she knew this was the first time Agatha was seeing her naked breasts and she flushed a deep crimson at the sight of Agatha’s gaze on her.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio pleaded again, her voice now a barely contained moan with every second she had to wait with Agatha just above her, staring down at her breasts.</p><p>But midnight blue eyes flickered up to meet Rio’s gaze and Agatha hesitated before she spoke again, her voice a breathy husk, “How are you real?”</p><p>The question took Rio by surprise and she raised her brows a little, watching as Agatha stared openly at her, unembarrassed and unashamed at her marvelling.</p><p>Rio couldn’t imagine a situation whether this were happening to her in real life, where Agatha Harkness was staring down at her with open, unrelenting, want.</p><p>But it was happening.</p><p>And soon she felt her lips enclose around her pert nipple, her hand slide back down between her legs.</p><p>Agatha was inside her again, her breast was in her mouth, and her moans were filling the room even as she clamped her own hand down against her mouth.</p><p>This time Agatha didn’t fumble at all where she touched her.</p><p>She didn’t hesitate to twist her hand.</p><p>She found her clit with ease.</p><p>Pressed into her without pause.</p><p>And nipped and sucked and teased her breast as she did so.</p><p>Rio came with a muffled cry of Agatha’s name, her hips bucking erratically as Agatha kept her filled with three fingers, testing Rio’s reactions as she tried to stretch her as much as she could.</p><p>When Agatha came up for breath she rested her cheek between Rio’s breasts but remained buried inside of her, her fingers curling and uncurling experimentally, as if trying to scope the very limits of what she could do to her.</p><p>“Stop, stop,” Rio groaned eventually, one hand reaching for Agatha’s taught bicep and the other moving to scratch at her scalp.</p><p>Agatha released a soft laugh that Rio felt against her chest and she huffed when Agatha didn’t pull out of her, squeezing her arm softly, “You can’t just leave them in. That’s so-…”</p><p>“What?” Agatha accused with a smirk against Rio’s skin, “Making up for lost time.”</p><p>“That isn’t how it works,” Rio said as she shifted her hips a little, squeezing her arm again as Agatha’s fingers twitched.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>And she pulled out slowly, making Rio groan a little at the slowness of it, chasing the feeling of her fingers inside her until they finally pulled away properly and Agatha moved her hand to rest across her stomach, the damp feel of it making Rio squirm for different reasons.</p><p>“This isn’t enough,” Agatha said softly, her fingers curling where they lay.</p><p>“I need more.”</p><p>Rio squeezed Agatha’s arm gently, “Let’s go upstairs. We can-…”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha pulled back and shook her head as she gazed down at Rio, “No. Not while Nicky’s home. We shouldn’t even…”</p><p>She glanced down and made light work of tugging Rio’s sweater down properly as she sat up again, straddling her hips and sighing.</p><p>She suddenly looked fraught.</p><p>“We shouldn’t have done this. Not here. Not like this.”</p><p>Rio chewed on her lower lip as she watched the frustration slip back into Agatha’s face, watched her close her eyes and run her clean hand through her hair.</p><p>“I’ve done this all wrong.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said quickly as she sat up and wrapped her arms tightly around Agatha’s hips. “There’s no right way to do this.”</p><p>“But there’s a wrong way. And that’s on a couch with your son asleep upstairs.”</p><p>Rio shook her head but realised she couldn’t reassure Agatha because it wasn’t her son upstairs.</p><p>It wasn’t her family home.</p><p>And she felt sick with it too.</p><p>“Next time, we can do it right. However you want. Wherever you want. Okay?”</p><p><em>Please let there be a next time,</em> Rio pleaded silently as she rubbed along Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>Agatha only sighed and Rio worried she’d lost her until she leant in and kissed her softly, lingering for a while until she pulled back.</p><p>“Stop being understanding.”</p><p>“You want me to pick a fight?”</p><p>“I want you. Period.”</p><p>Rio smiled at this, feeling that same warmth from before settle in her chest and she tugged Agatha closer to her, wanting to feel all of her, all at once.</p><p>“You have me.”</p><p>“I want more of you,” Agatha said quietly, an unusual shyness appearing across her features.</p><p>“I want all of you,” Rio whispered just as softly, leaning up to brush their lips together.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything but returned her hands to Rio’s hair, her thumbs brushing along the corners of her jaw.</p><p>And then Rio found that she was pressed onto her back again, Agatha expertly now adjusting her weight to lie over her properly, not protesting when Rio slipped her hand between them and slid into her pants once more.</p><p>Agatha came just as quickly as she had before and Rio almost came with her as she sank her teeth into her neck when she did.</p><p>Agatha whimpered where Rio was bolder and eased her down with soft brushes of her thumb over her clit, feeling feral with the response of the woman above her, burying her face in her soft hair.</p><p>“So quick,” Rio teased gently when she’d pulled her hand fully away, subtly wiping it on the side of her own pants.</p><p>Agatha just hummed, apparently too spaced to respond properly as Rio turned her head slightly into her, trying to nuzzle closer.</p><p>Agatha shifted a little and eventually pulled back to kiss Rio, nipping playfully at her lower lip.</p><p>Rio smiled at this and raised her brows when Agatha pulled away further and looked a little sheepish for a second.</p><p>“I… think I gave you a hickey.”</p><p>Rio blinked and reached absently for her neck as if she’d be able to feel it.</p><p>“Agatha. Are you fifteen years old?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and ducked her head down to Rio’s other side, placing soft kisses to the uninjured side of her neck before she simply collapsed back down and released a heavy breath against her skin.</p><p>“Alice will kill you,” Rio said absently as she closed her eyes and wrapped her arms properly around Agatha, feeling her chest warm up again with her being this close.</p><p>“You won’t tell-…”</p><p>“No, of course not. You’re safe with me.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly but Rio felt that she still appeared nervous so she leant down and kissed her cheek as best she could nuzzled into her for a second.</p><p>She felt Agatha relax in her arms.</p><p>“I’ll put one this side,” Agatha huffed, “even it out.”</p><p>“Don’t you dare.”</p><p>But Agatha had already nipped at her and Rio shifted beneath her, wrestling and rocking until she was able to turn them onto their sides and she could shuffle down to be face to face with Agatha on the couch.</p><p>Agatha looked back with a shyness that hadn’t been there all evening, and reached up to brush her fingers along Rio’s cheek, “I’m not even a little sorry.”</p><p>Rio smiled but rolled her eyes, “Why am I not surprised?”</p><p>Agatha hummed and moved her fingers down to brush across Rio’s lips, watching them part for her with interest.</p><p>“With other women… do you usually… I mean… how did I…?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said with a firmness to her tone that hadn’t even been there when chastising her about the hickey, “are you asking me if you are better than the other women I’ve slept with?”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>“After your first time with a woman?”</p><p>“I’m taking that as a no.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly and Agatha’s fingers circled back to trace the curve of Rio’s grin, “Actually, you’re the best I’ve had in a while.”</p><p>“A while?”</p><p>“Ever? Is that what you want to hear?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged slightly but Rio saw a glimmer of something in her eyes that told her it was exactly what she wanted to hear and she smiled some more even as Agatha pressed the tips of her two fingers just past her lips, “That just means we’ll need to keep doing this. Until you’re sure I’m the best you’ve ever had.”</p><p>Rio hummed softly, having no problem at all with dedicating the rest of her life to proving to Agatha that she believed that with her whole heart already.</p><p>But the hum turned to a groan when Agatha pressed her fingers further into her mouth and pressed down on her tongue.</p><p>Rio raised her brows a little as she pressed her tongue up slightly, watching Agatha’s pupils dilate again as she kept her gaze down on where her fingers were now fully swallowed by Rio’s lips.</p><p>She twitched them up slightly, pressing further in until she could feel the soft wet walls of the back of Rio’s throat, making her gag around her.</p><p>She only pulled back when she looked up and saw Rio’s eyes fill with unshed tears and she pulled fully out slowly, transferring her fingers to her own mouth to clean Rio’s spit from them.</p><p>Rio panted quietly, pressing more firmly into Agatha as she watched, “it’s a sin that we haven’t been doing this since we met.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her fingers slowly from her own lips, her eyes darting quickly across Rio’s face and Rio, despite what she’d just done, what Rio had allowed, and how desperate she must look for her, saw that same flicker of shyness in Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>It was like two different women.</p><p>One aware of the impact she had on Rio. The other completely oblivious or shocked by it.</p><p>But Rio had lived with a closeted and scared Alice for long enough that she knew why Agatha might be shy with her.!</p><p>And that’s why her next words took her by surprise so suddenly.</p><p>“I think you’re the reason I have Nicky.”</p><p>Rio frowned suddenly, worrying that she was so punch-drunk that she had missed what Agatha said entirely.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I think,” Agatha swallowed thickly, moving her hand down to wipe her fingers against Rio’s sweater before she settled her hand back underneath it and held Rio’s hip.</p><p>“I barely let Ralph touch me and then… after meeting you in the bar… the next time we were together I got so drunk we had sex for the first time since our wedding night and I didn’t make him wear a condom and… and the next month I was pregnant.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted in surprise, her brow furrowing more deeply at not only Agatha’s assumption but at this knew kernel of insight into Agatha’s relationship with her husband.</p><p>If twenty four year old Rio had known that Agatha Harkness had had sex with her husband because she couldn’t have sex with Rio she would have been the cockiest piece of shit in the world.</p><p>In fact, thirty two year old Rio suddenly felt like the cockiest piece of shit in the world.</p><p>“You had sex with Ralph because… you wanted me?”</p><p>“Something like that.”</p><p>“And that got you pregnant?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio’s brows shot up totally, staring in disbelief at Agatha even as a slow smirk crept up her face, “Did you think of me when-…?”</p><p>“You’re enjoying this.”</p><p>“Who wouldn’t? You had sex with your husband, thought of me, and got pregnant with Nicky? That’s-…”</p><p>“I hate that you’re enjoying this so much.”</p><p>“Agatha, you gotta give me this one.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and huffed out a breath against Rio’s smirking lips, “You’re missing the point.”</p><p>“Is the point that I’m your baby daddy?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Mmhm?”</p><p>But Rio’s grin must have had some impact on Agatha because she began to smile ever so slightly, “Can we get back to the point.”</p><p>“What was the point?”</p><p>“The point is that I’m married.”</p><p>The air was taken a little out of the room then and Rio’s smile slowly faded down to nothing.</p><p>The desire in her belly fizzled down to nausea and she tried to fight it off, desperate to not focus on the Ralph-sized elephant in the room.</p><p>She wasn’t a person who slept with married women. Not usually.</p><p>“Right. Unhappily so.”</p><p>She had to believe it.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You… you don’t have sex with him?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head a little, leaning in to brush their noses together lightly, “no.”</p><p>“Maybe once a year. He… I let him sleep around. As long as he’s discreet.”</p><p>“And you?” Rio asked cautiously, suddenly wondering if it had all been a clever lie, and that she wasn’t the first woman Agatha had slept with.</p><p>“Not until tonight.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“My life is Nicky and work. I don’t need anything else.”</p><p>Rio swallowed this down like a dry pill, but forced herself to nod, to not look like Agatha had just stabbed her through the heart.</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat quietly, a slight frown marring her features.</p><p>“Would you ever leave him?”</p><p>“I can’t answer that.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and nodded slowly, wondering how she’d let herself fall for a married woman so easily. Wondering why she’d thought coming here tonight was a good idea, that dancing in the kitchen with Agatha and her son was smart, that fucking her on the couch would help anything.</p><p>“I meant what I said earlier. That I want more of you.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio repeated, feeling somehow dizzy with her desire for Agatha, her desire to give more, and the worry that she’d pull away entirely.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed quietly, clearly responding to the way Rio was reacting, a hint of panic in her tone, “I mean it.”</p><p>“Okay,” was all Rio could say, too busy trying to focus on easing the racing of her traitorous heart.</p><p>“Do you want me?”</p><p>The question was so simple, so plainly spoken, that Rio frowned when it was asked, her eyes flashing open again, her brain doing backflips to try to decipher the twist in it, the con that wasn’t there.</p><p>Because she thought she’d been clear this whole time.</p><p>“I want you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded only slightly, and Rio could tell she was working through the same thoughts as Rio, expecting a change of heart that never came.</p><p>And so she pressed her lips to Rio’s, and Rio poured all of her want into the kiss, trying to tell Agatha that she meant it, that she wanted her so desperately but she couldn’t fathom a world where this would work for them.</p><p>But it was working now.</p><p>And so she focused on that, and nothing else.</p><p>They pulled apart only for air and Agatha rolled them again until she was over Rio and could bury her face against the side where she’d left her mark.</p><p>“If we stay here longer,” she whispered quietly against Rio’s skin, “I won’t be able to stop.”</p><p>“Then don’t.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and pulled back, all shyness from earlier gone again as she dazzled down at Rio, “I have to get up early to take Nicky to school tomorrow.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said with a dazed expression as she blinked up at Agatha. “But Friday. All day. Just us. Please? We need to talk.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slightly, her smile beginning to soften across her features.</p><p>But then she was pulling back, pulling Rio with her, kissing her again with her hands buried in her hair, pressing as close as she could to her.</p><p>“Bed,” she instructed quietly when she pulled away and left Rio aching for more.</p><p>And Rio knew that as soon as they left the relative safety of the couch that things would change.</p><p>They’d have to face the reality of it.</p><p>They’d have to acknowledged that what had happened tonight was a fluke. That they’d both just wanted each other so badly. But that want and need were different things.</p><p>Rio wanted Agatha and now she knew Agatha wanted Rio too. But that wasn’t anything when Agatha was married. With a son. And she had no plans to leave her husband.</p><p>And so they fumbled together until Agatha had Rio against the door and Rio was whining with newfound desire to get her hands back against Agatha, wanting to be inside her one last time, wanting her clothes off fully, her body flushed and sweaty and begging for more.</p><p>Rio rationalised to herself that the couch extended to the room around them. Past that, she’d be sensible. She’d relent and never again touch Agatha Harkness.</p><p>But Agatha was aggressive with her denial, holding Rio’s hands against the door and her hips pressing Rio’s down so she couldn’t rock them.</p><p>“We can’t.”</p><p>“One more. I haven’t even seen you naked.”</p><p>“Nicky,” Agatha warned quietly, raising her brows as Rio huffed and closed her eyes as she forced her body to relax, going slack beneath Agatha’s firm hold on her.</p><p>“Okay. I’ll behave. But next time.”</p><p>She flashed her eyes open and saw that even Agatha looked reluctant now to keep her from touching her.</p><p>“Naked,” Rio said insistently. “I want you naked and I want to taste you.”</p><p>Agatha’s hold on her wrists tightened so much that Rio hissed as her nails dug into her flesh and groaned when Agatha pressed a little firmer with her hips, “Rio.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Friday. Just two days.”</p><p>“If you can last that long then you need to let go of me,” Rio challenged suddenly, feeling a flair of confidence that Agatha wanted it as much as she did.</p><p>But Agatha had the trump card.</p><p>She had the son.</p><p>She had ultimate reason to not give in when Rio could have forgone her principles just one more time and pushed Agatha back onto the couch.</p><p>Agatha relaxed her hold on Rio slowly, and then all at once, stepping backwards with a frown and a huff that told Rio everything she needed to know.</p><p>And Rio smiled because at least this way, she wouldn’t be the only one suffering until she could get Agatha naked and on her back.</p><p>She moved a step closer and leant in to kiss Agatha’s cheek as politely as if they’d just met for the first time at a premier.</p><p>“You’ll have to sleep in the guest room,” Agatha said softly, watching as Rio pulled away.</p><p>But Rio hadn’t expected or wanted to sleep in the bed she assumed Agatha shared with Ralph and so she only nodded, taken aback slightly when Agatha suddenly held her face in her hands and kissed her firmly, keeping their lips pressed together for a longer than Rio was expecting and not pushing for anything more than the contact of it.</p><p>But she pulled away again and Rio was left with nothing but a hand in hers and a soft promise that they could be together properly again in two days time.</p><p>They walked silently through the house and up the stairs until Agatha stopped them at the entrance to the guest room and she pressed a quick kiss to Rio’s cheek.</p><p>“I’ll fetch you something to sleep in.”</p><p>She turned then and began to walk down the hall as Rio watched her and chewed on her lip for a second.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha turned halfway down the hallway and looked at Rio curiously.</p><p>Rio’s fingers tightened briefly where she held the doorframe and she hesitated only for a second, encouraged by the soft expression on Agatha’s face.</p><p>“Don’t make me sleep alone tonight.”</p>

<p><em>“Don’t make me sleep alone tonight.”</em></p><p>Agatha strode back over to her, her hands finding their home on Rio’s face.</p><p>“I can’t tonight. If Nicky…”</p><p>She trailed off as Rio looked down and began toying with the hem of Agatha’s sweater.</p><p>“I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away then and Rio felt the loss of her in a way she never had before. Because she’d <em>had</em> Agatha. In her home. She’d felt her against her skin, pressed against her body, writhing and moaning on top of her.</p><p>And now she was being faced with the reality.</p><p>That she had had Agatha.</p><p>And maybe, if she were lucky, she could have her again.</p><p>But she’d have to sleep alone.</p><p>Because Agatha didn’t belong to her.</p><p>Just as Rio was hitting the peak of her pity spiral, Agatha arrived back.</p><p>She pressed a dark t-shirt and soft pyjama pants against Rio’s chest and Rio saw a hesitation in Agatha as they locked eyes again.</p><p>“I want to,” she said quietly, her fingers tensing in the fabric of the offered pyjamas. “I don’t want to leave you but I can’t risk it.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio uttered, because she did understand the need to protect Nicky from this. They were fully grown adults and they didn’t know what they were doing. How would they explain it to a seven year old who had only just been introduced to Rio was suddenly sleeping with his mother.</p><p>That his mother was betraying his father.</p><p>So Rio had to be an adult and endure sleeping across the hall from Agatha when she knew what she tasted like, knew how she felt against her.</p><p>“Goodnight,” she said in a whisper, barely able to form the two syllables that locked her out of the night she wanted with the woman before her.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted and Rio thought, <em>hoped</em>, she might waver on her decision.</p><p>But she turned away.</p><p>She took long, confident strides back to her own room and left Rio standing in the door, staring hopelessly at the woman she’d just broken her own moral code for.</p><p>And then Rio closed the door.</p><p>And she was alone.</p><p>As the lock clicked into place Rio felt her world collapse in on itself.</p><p>She felt small, in a large room.</p><p>She moved away to strip Agatha’s clothes from her body and instead slip into the borrowed pyjamas.</p><p>They were soft against her skin and smelled of Agatha. And she hated herself for lifting the collar and breathing it in.</p><p>She’d become a monster who yearned.</p><p>The bed was a welcome embrace when she finally climbed into it after washing her face and brushing her teeth in the en suite attached.</p><p>She curled in on herself, tugging a plush pillow down to act as an inanimate, and therefore willing, receptacle of her sorrows. She wrapped around it and squeezed her eyes shut and willed sleep that wouldn’t come.</p><p>Perhaps fantasies were fantasises for a reason. Perhaps Agatha’s imagined lips and hands on her were better than the real thing.</p><p>Because the fantasy made Rio yearn.</p><p>But they didn’t make her mourn.</p><p>And now she’d had what she’d fantasied about. But she didn’t want the fantasy Agatha.</p><p>She wanted the real, warm, alive woman who could light a fire in her body and ask her to burn everything down.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and tried to think of things that weren’t Agatha.</p><p>But all she could smell was Agatha.</p><p>All she could feel on her body were the soft fabrics of Agatha’s clothes.</p><p>Sleep eluded her.</p><p>She lay awake all night, drifting for no more than twenty minutes at a time until the little alarm clock on the side told her it was 6:45 and she heard movement outside.</p><p>She peeled herself out of her Egyptian cotton prison and went quickly to brush her teeth and splash cool water on her face in an attempt to force herself to wake properly.</p><p>But there was no waking from the living nightmare that meant she had now experienced something she could probably never have again.</p><p>In the mirror she spotted the bruise on her neck and she touched it gently. It was evidence that last night had been real. That Agatha had wanted her enough to mark her as her own.</p><p>With no makeup with her and the prospect of seeing Nicky she simply swept her hair over her shoulder and hid it from view.</p><p>The hall was empty by the time Rio stepped into it and but she could hear noises not far away, the telltale signs of a coffee pot brewing, the tinny sounds of the radio, the soft giggles of a little boy who Agatha believed was hers because she’d wanted Rio so badly.</p><p>It made Rio’s heart stutter in her chest at the thought.</p><p>But her body moved where her mind remained stuck on the same topic that had kept her awake all night.</p><p>She made her way to the kitchen and found before her a sight that to anyone else would have been a simple, happy vignette but now to Rio Vidal was a reminder of what she didn’t have and was therefore barbarous to her sensitive heart.</p><p>“Morning,” Agatha said softly from her place by the island.</p><p>She wore a light, flannel robe and her hands were curled around a large mug of coffee.</p><p>“Did you sleep okay?”</p><p>Something in Agatha’s gaze told Rio that this wasn’t what Agatha actually wanted to know but she couldn’t say anything other than the bare-faced lie that came from her lips: “Amazingly.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched at the sides and Rio had to look away for fear she’d simply stare.</p><p>And staring over cornflakes was not a very cool thing to do.</p><p>She moved instead to sit on a stool beside Nicky, mirroring the smile he sent her over his bowl of Cheerios.</p><p>“Morning, kid. What’s on the schedule today?”</p><p>“School.”</p><p>“Just school? No championships to win?”</p><p>Nicky grinned around his spoon and Rio grinned back when he managed to dribble milk back into his bowl.</p><p>He was easy to love.</p><p>Agatha moved around with a paper towel to wipe at his mouth, kissing his cheek when she was done.</p><p>“Messy,” she said with a smile.</p><p>“Nicky’s taking his new jersey for basketball practice this afternoon.”</p><p>“Is that right?” Rio asked in amusement as Agatha moved away to fetch more coffee.</p><p>“They have a game next week.”</p><p>“I don’t think we’ll win. We never win.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Rio hummed thoughtfully, watching the little boy turn his attention back to his cereal. “Well, if you take that jersey with you I think you just might. Green is a lucky colour. Plus, with how good you were yesterday there’s <em>no way</em> you won’t win.”</p><p>Agatha placed her coffee down before her and grazed her fingers along the back of Rio’s hand as she pulled away.</p><p>“I’m not as tall as the others.”</p><p>“That’s okay,” Rio felt Agatha’s hand settle on her shoulder. She forced herself not to take it.</p><p>“I’m not that tall either and I can run rings around everyone.”</p><p>She felt Agatha squeeze her shoulder and then move away.</p><p>God, she wanted her.</p><p>“Rings?”</p><p>“It’s an expression, honey,” Agatha clarified with a smile. “Go get ready and I’ll be up in a minute.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and slid from his stool, moving quickly with his bowl to place it by the sink before he ran away upstairs.</p><p>In the quiet of the kitchen Rio felt suddenly nervous, suddenly exposed. She watched as Agatha took up the stool beside her and reach her hand halfway across the distance between them along the cool marble countertop.</p><p>“Did you actually sleep okay? Because-…”</p><p>“I didn’t sleep at all.”</p><p>Rio placed her hand cautiously by Agatha’s on the counter and stretched her fingers out so the pads of hers could brush over Agatha’s nails.</p><p>She watched as Agatha looked down at the movement and saw her biting her lip.</p><p>“Did you?”</p><p>“You know I don’t sleep.”</p><p>Agatha raised her fingers enough then to capture Rio’s as they moved down again and she interlocked their fingers in a move that made Rio’s heart stutter.</p><p>She took a breath and looked up to see Agatha watching her cautiously.</p><p>“Didn’t you take a pill?”</p><p>“No, I wasn’t sure if… no, I decided not to.”</p><p>Rio nodded and swallowed down the unspoken between them: she could have gone to Agatha in the night.</p><p>She frowned slightly and looked down at their hands.</p><p>Agatha took Rio’s breath away when she rubbed her thumb in small circles against Rio’s skin.</p><p>“Can you stay? It won’t take long to drop Nicky off and I don’t have to be anywhere until the afternoon.”</p><p>“I have wardrobe fittings today,” Rio said quietly, mesmerised by the thumb still brushing slowly over her skin.</p><p>It felt unreal, unbelievable. Like Rio had found the road to El Dorado. Only the gold was instead a goddess and Rio would worship at her feet if she asked her to.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered softly, snapping Rio from her daydreams of Agatha draped in white robes, wearing a laurel wreath and Rio feeding her grapes on a chaise.</p><p>Dark eyes moved up to meet light blue and that’s when Agatha moved.</p><p>She stood from her stool in one quick movement and pressed her lips to the corner of Rio’s mouth, her free hand just ghosting along Rio’s jaw.</p><p>Rio gasped quietly and turned her head to capture Agatha’s lips properly, and Agatha’s hand settled properly on her cheek as she kissed her back.</p><p>It was tender more than fierce. Gentle rather than greedy.</p><p>And Rio thought she’d die because of it.</p><p>She thought she’d cease to exist when Agatha pulled away from her. When she was denied the ability to simply live against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“We can’t,” Agatha whispered as she pulled away. But she kissed Rio again. And then again. And Rio found herself pining in the half a second between each kiss.</p><p>It happened ten times, though Rio hadn’t counted. Hadn’t had the wherewithal to do so.</p><p>But Agatha was pulling away properly now and Rio actually whimpered because of it, actually fell from her stool and reached her free hand to brush hair behind Agatha’s ear and capture her lips again.</p><p>Now just an inch away from her, Agatha wrapped an arm around Rio’s waist and pressed her closer, their soft kisses truncated with soft breaths in between, brief and unconscious checks that the other wanted the next kiss.</p><p>But Rio could have done it forever.</p><p>She could have given up everything to just wait around for Agatha to kiss her like this. Just like this. She would make a promise to never press for more. Would simply always just wait patiently for Agatha to press her lips to hers whenever she wanted.</p><p>But Agatha was pulling away again, only this time moving so far that now the island was between them.</p><p>She ran a hand through her hair and Rio was pining again.</p><p>“We can’t,” Agatha repeated.</p><p>And Rio knew she was right.</p><p>Knew they were being too brazen with it.</p><p>She dropped her gaze to her coffee and pulled it towards her for something to do. For something to hold.</p><p>“I should go check on Nicky.”</p><p>“I should go change.”</p><p>Rio glanced up and saw her own pain reflected in Agatha’s gaze. It made her pine more.</p><p>“Friday,” Agatha said quietly, “Come over. Stay for the day.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, her gaze falling back to the hand she’d just been holding that now rested on the island.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said gently, forcing Rio to look up at her again. “I want to talk about this. About us.”</p><p>Rio nodded again but her tongue felt thick in her mouth because the reminder of Friday brought with it two things that made her feel sick: the first being that Agatha could easily tell her this wasn’t what she wanted. The second being that Ralph would be there in the evening, and Rio wouldn’t be able to look at her for fear she’d see Ralph too near, too close.</p><p>But Agatha was moving back around and touching Rio’s arm as she walked past, squeezing her forearm gently.</p><p>And Rio took just another second before she went to grab her discarded bag of dirty clothes from yesterday and she disappeared back to her assigned bedroom.</p><p>Once alone behind a closed door she changed quickly, folding Agatha’s pyjamas up and placing them neatly on the end of the bed. She checked the bathroom, and did one final check of the room to make sure she’d left it as pristine as she’d found it.</p><p>Once sure it was perfect, she left again in the clothes she’d worn when she arrived yesterday.</p><p>Only this was the worst walk of shame she’d ever experienced.</p><p>She’d been part of an affair.</p><p>She’d kissed and fucked and been fucked by a married woman.</p><p>She’d made plans to do it again. To talk it through. To continue the affair.</p><p>She hovered by the front door, killing time as she waited for Agatha and Nicky by checking her phone.</p><p>It had died.</p><p>Alice would kill her.</p><p>But five minutes later and Nicky was barrelling down the stairs and Rio looked up just as she saw the little boy appear in the hall, grinning at Rio with his backpack almost the same size as him on his back.</p><p>“Will you be back soon?”</p><p>Agatha had appeared behind him and Rio felt her stomach flip as she felt her eyes on her.</p><p>“Would I really want to miss learning from the best?”</p><p>Nicky’s smile turned shy and he reached to grab the straps of his backpack as Agatha moved closer and Rio caught the familiar scent of her perfume on the air.</p><p>It was torturous.</p><p>“Come on. Let’s get you to school.”</p><p>Rio caught Agatha’s eye and she paused for just a second before she stepped out of the way and felt the brush of Agatha’s arm against her own.</p><p>It had to be deliberate. She’d given her enough space.</p><p>Rio let Nicky go out before them and she looked up as Agatha met her gaze when she stepped past.</p><p>She looked tired, and somehow nervous.</p><p>And Rio couldn’t help herself when she stepped in and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. It was friendly, or as friendly as she could manage.</p><p>And she turned before she could see Agatha’s reaction.</p><p>Billy was too interested in walking towards the outside gate anyway to much notice what his mother was doing so Rio felt confident she hadn’t overstepped.</p><p>She waited at the gate for Agatha to join them and watched as she tapped in the code so it would open onto the quiet street.</p><p>It felt like entering a different life, stepping out of Agatha’s arena and back into the tree-lined street.</p><p>But as the gate closed, Agatha had turned to catch her eye and reached for her arm.</p><p>“Friday?”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only turn as Nicky stepped towards his mum to take her hand and smile shyly at Rio again.</p><p>She forced herself to return the smile and turned from them both with a wave to find her little hybrid parked up the street.</p><p>Once in the safety of her car she released a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding and stared at her steering wheel.</p><p>Had last night really happened? Had she just spent two precious minutes in Agatha’s kitchen, kissing her sweetly, allowing Agatha to hold her hand and wrap her arm around her?</p><p>She started the car and shook her head to herself, finding a discarded wire somewhere so she could plug in her phone and get out of there as quickly as possible.</p><p>Halfway down the freeway her phone lit up with Alice calling her and she grimaced as she pressed the button to answer and Alice’s tinny voice came through the speaker.</p><p>“Holy shit, Rio. I was so close to sending a search party. What happened?”</p><p>“I stayed over at Agatha’s.”</p><p>“You stayed over? What? The kid was so useless at basketball you had to run into extra time?”</p><p>“No. No. He’s cute. Sweet. I just… had too much wine to drive so Agatha told me to stay.”</p><p>“Please tell me you didn’t get drunk again.”</p><p>“No, Alice,” Rio said with a huff, wondering if this was what Alice was annoyed about then how she might feel about Rio being inside of the great Agatha Harkness just a few hours ago.</p><p>“I behaved.”</p><p>“Sure, whatever. Just get back soon. The costume guys will be here in less than an hour and I want to tell you all about me and Jen. And <em>you</em> can reassure me that you managed to charm Agatha.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but hung up.</p><p>The drive back home allowed her the time she needed to sort through her complicated feelings about what she’d done.</p><p>She knew she didn’t want to be the cause of anyone’s marriage breaking up. But she also knew she hated Ralph. And everything was currently pointing to Ralph being a prick so that hatred was justified.</p><p>She knew she liked Agatha. She was beginning to suspect that she might be falling for Agatha. She knew she wanted to kiss her and touch her and taste her.</p><p>She knew Agatha liked her. At least enough to be curious. At least enough to come within barely minutes of Rio admittedly not doing her best work on a couch when she’d been taken by surprise and was so shocked that she was even allowed to touch Agatha like that.</p><p>She knew that Agatha would be nervous and scared and the chances of her burning her carefully curated image down for Rio were next to zero.</p><p>Let alone her family.</p><p>She knew she’d never destroy her family for Rio.</p><p>Which left her with one choice: if she wanted Agatha she had to be a mistress. She had to be as discreet as possible. As available as she could make herself on the off-chance that Agatha had the time and the inclination to let her near her again.</p><p>She would have to get a handle on her feelings and treat this as just another girl she could have fun with. But even as she thought that, even as she agreed that in her mind, she felt her chest feel hollow with the idea that it could never be more.</p><p>That she could touch Agatha but never reach her.</p><p>No further through working through her feelings than she had been whilst tossing and turning in the bed the night before, Rio soon pulled up to her little house.</p><p>She spotted Alice’s car already parked up a little on the sidewalk and she rolled her eyes at the haphazard nature of it.</p><p>Sometimes she wondered how Alice managed to be so diligent and professional when it came to work but so clumsy and unbothered in her real life.</p><p>But she had little time to think on it as her own front door was flung open and Alice was there to greet her.</p><p>“Dirty stopout,” she proclaimed with a grin.</p><p>“Get in here. We don’t have long and I want all the details. Did she talk to you about working together? Was there any chat about-…”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio groaned as she stepped over the threshold, “Please. I’ve barely slept I-…”</p><p>“No, no. Don’t give me that. You have to work today. Tomorrow and Saturday you have to complain and sleep but this morning you’re working.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and threw her bag down as she traipsed through to the kitchen to source coffee.</p><p>She idly wondered what Agatha’s coffee of choice would be. Did she get only organic beans? Did she only shop in Erewhon? Probably.</p><p>“So, tell me!”</p><p>“We mostly spoke about Nicky. And a little about the circuit and-…”</p><p>Alice huffed softly but Rio ignored it as she stirred an ungodly amount of sugar into her coffee.</p><p>“We watched a movie and then we went to bed.”</p><p>“God. Well, the fact that she let you stay is positive. She could have called you a cab and been done with it.”</p><p>She nodded and swallowed down the horrifying idea that Agatha could have done just that even after what they’d done together on the couch.</p><p>But Alice soon moved onto the topic of her and Jen.</p><p>And Rio soon relaxed into the corner of her couch, watching but not really listening to her best friend.</p><p>She kept thinking about Agatha.</p><p>How she’d felt against her. How she’d looked at her during and afterwards.</p><p>How she’d been so soft this morning. How she’d kissed her over and over until she had to pull away. Twice.</p><p>And she thought of nothing but Agatha for the rest of the morning. After Alice had finished her romantic tale of how she’d told Jen she loved her and how Jen had said it back. After the costume department descended upon Rio’s little Spanish villa and poked and prodded at her for sizings and colour testing.</p><p>And then she was free to be alone for a while.</p><p>She showered and changed and decided that she couldn’t sit around and pine for a woman she may never have again. And even if she did, she’d have her only in ways that were physical. And secret.</p><p>She took herself off to her gym and threw her thoughts away as she pushed her tired body to the limit of what she could handle.</p><p>The text came as Rio was finishing up the workout.</p><p>The endorphins she’d sweat for dissolved in her brain and body as she read the words over and over.</p><p>She wasn’t an idiot.</p><p>She knew what they meant.</p><p>2:30pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Ralph will be home all day tomorrow. Some meetings have come up for me. You can’t come over early. Sorry.</p><p>Agatha had changed her mind.</p><p>Or maybe it was simply that she’d got what she wanted out of Rio.</p><p>And she’d been acting that morning, trying to soften the blow she knew she’d eventually deliver.</p><p>She’d had her orgasms, felt what it was to be with a woman, and decided it wasn’t for her.</p><p>Or simply that Rio wasn’t.</p><p>The only solace Rio could get from the situation was that at least she’d felt the touch of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>She was now one of the privileged three people in the world who had been deigned good enough to be inside of her, to hear her moan, to be pressed so close nothing else existed but <em>her</em>.</p><p>True to form, she didn’t text back.</p>

Sorry.</em></p><p><em>Agatha had changed her mind.</em></p><p><em>Or maybe it was simply that she’d got what she wanted out of Rio.</em></p><p><em>She’d had her orgasms, felt what it was to be with a woman, and decided it wasn’t for her.</em></p><p><em>The only solace Rio could get from the situation was that at least she’d felt the touch of Agatha Harkness.</em></p><p><em>She was now one of the privileged three people in the world who had been deigned good enough to be inside of her, to hear her moan, to be pressed so close nothing else existed but <em>her</em>.</em></p><p><em>True to form, she didn’t text back.</em></p><p>She spent the rest of the afternoon doing everything she could to not think about Agatha.</p><p>She cleaned her house within an inch of its life.</p><p>She did her laundry and tidied her clothes away, placing her favourite cowboy shirt in pride of place in her second drawer.</p><p>She called her mum and spoke to her for over two hours.</p><p>She threw herself into bed at 10pm and took a melatonin to help her drift off.</p><p>But the sting of it really settled in when Alice called to ask if she wanted a lift to Agatha’s house on Friday morning.</p><p>Alice was excited for the dinner and chatting away about the wine she’d bought especially for the occasion, about the outfit she was wearing because she knew Jen liked it and it wasn’t too smart or too casual.</p><p>It reminded Rio of the gifts she’d bought Agatha and Nicky when she went over two days ago.</p><p>Her mother’s empanadas and her own basketball jersey.</p><p>Sweet. Domestic.</p><p>Now a fantasy.</p><p>She’d been a fool to think it could be anything but.</p><p>Alice hadn’t been right that Agatha didn’t want her at all. But she had been right that if anything were to happen it would be a flash of desire, a quick fuck with no feelings and then nothing.</p><p>And Rio would be shunned because Agatha would make it so.</p><p>She’d push her from Hollywood because she could and because the fear of people knowing she’d stooped so low as to sleep with a barely-established actress like Rio would be enough to make her burn Rio’s career to the ground.</p><p>She could block her from the best producers, the best studios, the best directors.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Alice asked suddenly, making Rio snap from her doom spiral.</p><p>“What? Sorry. I didn’t sleep great.”</p><p>“Well snap out of it. Tonight’s important to me. Agatha is Jen’s best friend and I know you two are getting on now but you need to nail this. Not just for me but for your career.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but felt her stomach flip as she realised that her stupidity would impact Alice too.</p><p>If she were flung from Hollywood then Alice would be right behind her.</p><p>And what that meant for hers and Jen’s relationship, she didn’t know.</p><p>But Rio hadn’t spoken for a second or two and Alice was already filling the silence.</p><p>“Jen floated the idea of a joined project. Of something Agatha was producing. Just an idea still but I think if things keep going well then we might be in there.”</p><p>“As in… me and Agatha working together?”</p><p>“Yeah. I know she’s <em>Agatha Harkness</em> but you’re hot shit too. Don’t forget that. She’d be a fool to overlook you and the pull you have at the box office.”</p><p>Rio sighed and flopped down onto her floral bedspread, toying idly with the soft fabric by her hip.</p><p>“Besides in just a couple months time you’ll have an Oscar nomination and-…”</p><p>“Wait, wait. Alice.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath and then fell onto her back, staring up at the ceiling as she said: “Has Agatha asked Jen about this? Has she given her some sort of-…”</p><p>“She’s optioning a movie and has you in mind for one of the roles, apparently. Don’t get your hopes up. It’s early days but just to say: keep on her good side. Being friendly with Agatha is your ticket to the best this town has to offer.”</p><p>Not long after, they hung up.</p><p>Rio had long since fallen into a deep depression, and she allowed herself to wallow in it for an hour only.</p><p>She timed it precisely. Keeping an eye on the clock on the side to make sure she didn’t slip into hour two of her self-pity party.</p><p>But her wallowing brought with it a determination to act, to protect, to reassure.</p><p>She couldn’t make Agatha want her. But she could protect Alice. She could ensure Agatha knew she’d protect her too.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, Agatha wouldn’t destroy more than her heart.</p><p>Pushing her heartache to the side, Rio focused for the rest of the day on building herself back up to a facsimile of an actress with the world at her feet and the kind of happy-go-lucky attitude she used to carry with her like a permanent badge of pride.</p><p>She went to the local market to buy fresh flowers and organic wine. She picked out a dress that was casual enough for a dinner at a friend’s but pretty enough to still look like she’d made an effort. She put on a little more makeup than she usually would, wore more jewellery, wore flattering lipstick and nice shoes.</p><p>In short, she did everything she could to look good, so she’d feel good too.</p><p>When Alice was outside her door at six, honking impatiently, Rio felt more energised, more ready to face Agatha than she had felt since she received the text.</p><p>“Goddamn, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio slipped in the car beside Alice and narrowly avoided smacking herself in the face with large bouquet of flowers.</p><p>“Pulled out all the stops? Or just got a date after this?”</p><p>Rio smirked a little, pleased her choice to dress up had an immediate affect, even if Alice weren’t the intended audience.</p><p>“Just wanted to look good for our host.”</p><p>Not a lie.</p><p>Alice hummed and started the car back up as Rio looked her best friend over with a small smile.</p><p>“You look good, superstar. If I didn’t know any better I’d think you were trying to seduce your girlfriend.”</p><p>“I’m <em>always</em> trying to seduce Jen. By Sunday we’ll be away again so I need to squeeze in as much seduction as possible.”</p><p>“You can stay, you know? If it’s easier? I know you get so bored. And now you have Jen, well, it’s different.”</p><p>Alice shot Rio a sideways glance and Rio knew what she was about to say before she even said it: “You need me around. You get lonely.”</p><p>“I do not.”</p><p>Alice just raised her brows and Rio sighed and turned her head to look out the car window.</p><p>“It’s time to find someone.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“I mean it. You’re cute and funny and <em>kind</em> and rich and-…”</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>“After the Oscar’s. Four more months. I want you to seriously consider getting out there. You’ve not had a proper girlfriend since college.”</p><p>“Not true. Victoria was-…”</p><p>“You saw her for six months then decided you weren’t in love.”</p><p>“And? Still a girlfriend.”</p><p>“It was an extended affair.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, knowing Alice was right. Victoria had been a warm body who knew how Rio liked to be touched and how to make good coffee and where the best bars were in any city in the world.</p><p>But they hadn’t really talked. They hadn’t shared things or welcomed each other into one another’s lives.</p><p>It was just convenient. Just easier than having no one.</p><p>“Besides,” Alice was continuing, taking Rio’s silence as an invitation to go on.</p><p>“I want to see you happy. To see you settled.”</p><p>“Don’t lie. You think it’ll be good for the brand.”</p><p>“Don’t be a bitch. You’re my friend before you’re my client. I’ve not been this happy in a long time and that’s because of Jen. I want that for you too.”</p><p>Rio felt her chest constrict as she thought of what could have been with Agatha.</p><p>Was there a universe where Agatha had left Ralph and run away with Rio? Could she have seen herself as a step-mom to Nicky? Would they work longterm? Would Agatha get bored of her or decide a fleeting fantasy of Rio wasn’t as good as the reality?</p><p>But then a hand had reached across, and amidst the forest of fresh flowers, Alice had linked their fingers and was squeezing Rio firmly.</p><p>“I love you. I want you to be happy. You deserve someone who will make you happy.”</p><p>But Rio found she couldn’t respond.</p><p>She only squeezed Alice’s hand and tried to funnel into it the acknowledgement of her friend’s care.</p><p>They remained silent for the rest of the short journey into the Hills and by the time they arrived Rio had schooled her thoughts again to be ready to act rings around her own emotions.</p><p>They traipsed up to the gate and waited for the familiar sound of it unlocking, Rio watching Alice with amusement as she took everything in.</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Rio laughed even as the door opened and Agatha appeared in the doorway.</p><p>She was in a striped blue and white button down and matching white jeans. She had a pair of glasses on her head and a hardness to her expression that made Rio want to turn and run.</p><p>“Agatha!” Alice shouted with a grin, moving towards the woman with a beam and brandishing her wine, “this place is… <em>huge</em>.”</p><p>Agatha only smiled tightly, stepping aside to let Alice in and offering only a cursory hug as the smaller woman stepped inside and muttered another, “holy shit”, once she’d seen the inside of the house.</p><p>“Ralph and Jen are out back.”</p><p>“I’ll put this in the kitchen,” Alice said happily as she slowly stepped away and gazed all around her in awe of what money and taste could produce.</p><p>It was Rio’s turn to step up now and she did so with a fear that so clenched her heart she could barely breathe.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t reached for her or even offered the small hug she’d deigned to give Alice.</p><p>Her blue eyes were focused on the floor and Rio sucked in a sharp breath at the sight of Agatha’s jaw flexing before her.</p><p>The jaw she’d brushed her lips and tongue and teeth across only two nights ago.</p><p>“Hi,” she offered softly, turning fully to Agatha in the open doorway, unsure whether or not ignoring her would be a better option.</p><p>“I thought it meant more than that,” Agatha said in a venomous whisper that chilled Rio’s very soul.</p><p>Agatha moved then, still not exactly looking at her as she made to close the door behind her and Rio had to shift quickly to avoid it closing on her.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>But Agatha raised her gaze to her and Rio was thunderstruck by what she saw in it.</p><p>Agatha looked hurt.</p><p>She looked devastated.</p><p>“Not glam enough for you? Not fun and sexy with a kid in tow and-…”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>Rio felt a prickling sense of shame tickle her body, hitting every inch of her with it’s creeping tendrils and it’s insidious promise of pain.</p><p>“You called it off.”</p><p>But as soon as the words left her lips she could see in them a truth she’d missed before. Perhaps because she’d expected Agatha to call it off. Perhaps because she’d assumed she would or maybe, just maybe, she’d hoped that she’d do it sooner rather than later to save Rio falling more for her.</p><p>Agatha’s brows furrowed a little but she still looked just as hurt as before, her face just as taught.</p><p>They stared at each other for what felt like a lifetime, and Rio took a step closer even as Agatha took a step back, her body coming into contact with the closed front door behind her.</p><p>Agatha took a soft breath.</p><p>And Rio had never seen her eyes sparkle like that before.</p><p>But it wasn’t something she ever wanted to see again because Agatha was fighting tears.</p><p>“Ralph was here. I had meetings. I couldn’t get away and you couldn’t come to me.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p><em>Oh.</em></p><p>There was a noise then through in the kitchen that made Agatha’s gaze dart from Rio’s for the first time since she’d looked up, and Rio felt in the absence of it a sudden sinking feeling of panic overwhelm her.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t pulled away. Agatha had simply had to change plans.</p><p>But now Agatha was walking past her and Rio swallowed thickly where her perfume filled her lungs and she had to fight to remain cognisant of the role she had to play today.</p><p>It was different to the one she’d assumed it would be.</p><p>She wasn’t a spurned lover.</p><p>She was a grovelling one.</p><p>She turned to follow Agatha into the kitchen and found Ralph in there with her.</p><p>He looked handsome. And Rio felt sick that he was there. In his kitchen. Where he had every right to be when Rio was just there to make up the numbers, to keep Alice company.</p><p>He was opening a bottle of red and indulgently sniffing the cork. “Beautiful bouquet on this one.”</p><p>Agatha was fetching another glass before placing it on the side, glancing at Rio as she did.</p><p>She’d pulled back the tears that had threatened to spill but still looked haunted.</p><p>Rio’s nausea increased.</p><p>She forced herself to look away and swallowed the sickness down.</p><p>“Pinot isn’t for me. Tastes like juice. I prefer a Barolo. Fuller bodied,” Rio said in Ralph’s direction, even as her eyes moved back to Agatha as the woman moved forwards to take her flowers from her.</p><p>“Oh no, a Pinot Noir for me. Much lighter. That way you can enjoy the fruits.”</p><p>But Rio didn’t much care for Ralph’s opinion on wine, or anything at all for that matter.</p><p>Agatha’s hand had just grazed her own when she took the flowers from her and Rio felt her whole body react to it as if she had burned her with a lit match.</p><p>“Ralph,” Agatha said as she turned away from Rio, moving to a cabinet to fetch a vase.</p><p>“Enough wine talk. Go entertain our guests and top up their glasses. I’ll be out with Rio in a second.”</p><p>Ralph didn’t object to this but then Rio supposed he wouldn’t, would he? It was Agatha who was the catch here. Agatha with the millions and the face that could launch a thousand ships.</p><p>And Ralph was just a man.</p><p>Left alone again, Rio placed the tote bag with the bottle of wine she’d brought on the side and remained silent as she turned her gaze to Agatha who seemed intent on the flowers she was currently arranging.</p><p>“You thought I’d had my way with you and were done?”</p><p> </p><p>There was a beat of silence and Rio felt the sickness settle in the base of her throat.</p><p>“Or maybe you thought I’d changed my mind? I’d faked it and lied to you?”</p><p>Agatha’s tone hadn’t softened as she transitioned from instructing Ralph to berating Rio and Rio flinched with it, moving slowly closer.</p><p>“I thought-…”</p><p>“You could have at least had the decency to tell me. To use your words, Rio. God knows you use them enough any other time. I am not some slut you fuck and then ignore.”</p><p>It would have been easier if Agatha had slapped her.</p><p>But she persevered, being braver now than she had been when she had assumed Agatha didn’t want her anymore.</p><p>She moved close, placing her hand on the island by Agatha’s hip and when she didn’t react or pull away she moved it to her body to get her to turn to her.</p><p>Agatha resisted for a second before she did, and Rio felt her heart thrum in her chest when she realised that Agatha wasn’t looking at her but her eyes had gone that same watery way again.</p><p>She raised her hand cautiously to cup Agatha’s cheek and lifted her head up to look at her properly.</p><p>It was dangerous. Too out in the open.</p><p>There would be no good excuse if anyone walked in.</p><p>But Rio didn’t care. And Agatha clearly didn’t either.</p><p>“I assumed you’d got what you wanted out of me and I didn’t know what to say. But I wanted to come here and let you know that even if that were true, that I’d never tell anyone what happened. You’d always be safe with me.”</p><p>“Don’t say things like that,” Agatha breathed softly, as she moved her hands to the collar of Rio’s dress.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Agatha just shook her head and pulled away, her fingers tightening their hold and then releasing suddenly, and Rio felt like she’d faint as her own hand hovered in the space between them.</p><p>“We can’t do this. The other night was a mistake.”</p><p>“Agatha, don’t. Please.”</p><p>“I got carried away. I wasn’t thinking straight.”</p><p>Rio took a sharp breath in and reached back out for Agatha, this time stepping close so she could wrap an arm around her front and reach for her hip.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t pull away, she simply remained standing, her gaze down on one of the daisies hanging limping from the bouquet. She touched it lightly as Rio’s fingers curled more tightly around her hip.</p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p>“It’s best for both of us,” Agatha said quietly, turning her head to look at Rio who was now just inches away.</p><p>And Rio knew she was right, knew she was doing to right thing. And that it was only Agatha who could decide. After all, it was her marriage.</p><p>But it hurt. It hurt beyond reason.</p><p>She met Agatha’s gaze and saw her blue irises begin to swirl again with unshed tears and she couldn’t believe it when she felt herself nod and pull away.</p><p>And Agatha opened her mouth as if to say something but Rio had turned away quickly for fear she’d fall to her knees and grovel if she didn’t.</p><p>She made quick strides towards the doors and didn’t turn back to see Agatha watching her.</p><p>Outside in the still warm September sun, Rio saw a discarded basketball on the deck and thought of the little boy who must have left it there.</p><p>She thought of his smile and his charm that was so like his mother’s.</p><p>And the evening she’d spent with both of them. Of the world now completely shut off from her grasp.</p><p>And then Ralph came into view, sitting in one of the armchairs and grinning across at Rio as she approached.</p><p>She’d been right the first time.</p><p>There was none of him in Nicky.</p><p>“There she is! Talking shop with my dear wife?”</p><p>“Something like that,” Rio said with a sweet smile, feeling the absence of the feel of Agatha against her never more than when she was in the presence of the husband.</p><p>“What took you so long?” Alice accused with a frown, her arm draped over Jen’s shoulders on the couch.</p><p>“I was helping with the flowers.”</p><p>“Jennifer,” Rio added with a smile as she went to sit by Alice’s side, leaving the second armchair free for Agatha.</p><p>“Vidal. Always a pleasure, never a chore.”</p><p>Rio laughed as she settled in, brushing her dress down over her legs and crossing them demurely.</p><p>It was easy to pretend. It was what she was good at.</p><p>“Trying to convince my client to star in some crappy chick flick with you?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and tilted her head as Jen watched her suspiciously from the other end of the couch.</p><p>“I didn’t know that was an option for polite dinner party conversation. But I’ll be sure to bring it up.”</p><p>Jen scoffed and Alice nudged Rio gently even as she raised her brows down at her, wondering if this had anything to do with their phone conversation the previous day.</p><p>But Ralph had moved from his seat and was pouring Rio a wine without checking first that she wanted red when there was an open bottle of white that both Alice and Jen were drinking.</p><p>She thanked him anyway and took a sip of the Pinot Noir, a testament to her acting skills that she didn’t grimace at the thinness of it.</p><p>But she was distracted suddenly because Agatha was approaching, and she caught Rio’s eye.</p><p>Rio had to look away for fear she’d dissolve before her.</p><p>“Finally, the host!” Jen shouted with a grin, “took you long enough.”</p><p>“Actually I’m also the host,” Ralph said suddenly and Rio looked to Agatha’s reaction to this but saw she was too focused on Rio’s red wine, raising her brows at it.</p><p>“Sorry, Ralph. Of course. Just used to it being mostly Agatha, is all.”</p><p>Agatha had stood from her chair, pouring herself a glass of white before she went to take Rio’s wine without asking and swapped the glasses.</p><p>“Rio doesn’t like Pinot Noir.”</p><p>Everybody turned to stare at Agatha as Agatha made eyes at Ralph, taking her seat up again.</p><p>Rio blinked, her hand now curled around the cold cup of her new wine glass as she watched as Agatha took her seat and sipped at the deep burgundy liquid she’d just stolen away from Rio.</p><p>“She didn’t say no.”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped in the direction of Ralph and she saw his eyes flash, a challenge to his wife for showing him up. Perhaps also Jen’s dismissal of his position as host getting to him too.</p><p>“But she told you in the kitchen she didn’t like it.”</p><p>This was more than just about wine.</p><p>Rio shifted slightly in her seat and looked back to Agatha, willing her to look her way and drop it.</p><p>“It’s just never good enough, is it?”</p><p>Rio felt the wind change around them, saw the flash in Agatha’s eyes and the twitch of her fingers against the red of her glass.</p><p>Ralph was staring at his wife, his free hand in a fist at his side, his gaze as cold as the wine in Rio’s glass.</p><p>“I think we got off topic here,” Jen said suddenly, panic lacing her voice as she sat forward from Alice and cleared her throat.</p><p>“Come on! You’re the dream couple! Cute kid, amazing house, both hot. It’s just wine. And Ralph’s right, Agatha. Rio didn’t say no.”</p><p>Rio felt this was a little unfair, she’d barely had time to and was being polite either way. Then, she supposed, she wasn’t being exactly polite when she was negotiating an affair with Ralph’s wife not minutes ago in the kitchen.</p><p>“You know what?”</p><p>Ralph had said suddenly, turning to Rio, “You didn’t say no and you also didn’t say you wanted the white. So we’re all at fault here. Which do you want, Rio?”</p><p>Rio knew this was a power play, that he was trying to get her on side, to manipulate her into going for the first choice but even if Agatha had handed her a cup of poison she’d have picked Agatha’s offering over his any day.</p><p>“I was being polite before. I don’t like Pinot Noir. I never have. But this,” Rio held up the glass and glanced briefly to Agatha. “This I’d drink any day of the week. Gladly so.”</p><p>They locked eyes and Rio thought she saw a flicker of the anguish she’d seen before in Agatha.</p><p>But she looked away quickly, unwilling to let herself get sucked in again.</p><p>Ralph scoffed and muttered something under his breath that made the atmosphere crackle with something dark and incendiary.</p><p>Alice’s hand flew to Rio’s leg and she dug her nails into her, turning her body ever so slightly towards her as if there were something coiled nearby ready to spring and Rio hadn’t seen it yet but she was in the predator’s vision.</p><p>Rio glanced at her best friend, saw in her eyes the panic that had caused her to turn to her and raised her brows in question.</p><p>But it was clear she’d missed something. That she hadn’t heard what Ralph had said.</p><p>But everyone else had.</p><p>“Ralph,” Jen had said quietly, shifting her weight ever so slightly forwards.</p><p>But Rio looked to Agatha and saw that she looked beyond reason suddenly, beyond any placatory tone that Jen may have used onto try and calm Ralph.</p><p>“Get out.”</p><p>Rio shifted slightly, Alice’s grip on her upper thigh so tight she thought she’d rip her dress.</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>Rio asked suddenly, wanting to know why everyone was losing it. She dragged her gaze away from Agatha to look at Ralph who still looked furious but who wasn’t looking at anyone in particular, his gaze on the floor.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice warned quietly, but Ralph was already speaking again:</p><p>“I said: fucking flirt.”</p><p>Rio’s brows shot up her forehead and Agatha raised to her feet, repeating what she’d said earlier: “Get out.”</p><p>“Surely it’s enough to have your little fan club on set, on the red carpet, but not at my table, convincing my son to swap teams. Flirting with you so openly.”</p><p>Rio moved her hand to Alice’s still clutching at her thigh and she went to extricate it gently, and Alice allowed it.</p><p>Rio moved cautiously from her position on the couch to stand just behind Agatha and touched her forearm gently, curling her fingers slowly around it, her steady gaze on Ralph who’d turned to watch her move to his wife.</p><p>“Agatha, don’t.”</p><p>“You need to leave.”</p><p>Ralph didn’t move, his eyes briefly dropping to Rio’s hold on Agatha before he raised his gaze again and looked across at his wife.</p><p>He watched her for a second and Rio could only guess the coldness in Agatha’s eyes, but she remained where she was just behind her, her fingers tightening ever so slightly on Agatha’s arm.</p><p>“I’m not homophobic,” Ralph said suddenly, sounding an awful lot like a homophobic person might.</p><p>“I don’t care that you’re gay. Or that you clearly have a crush on my wife.”</p><p>His gaze dropped down to Rio’s hand on Agatha’s arm again and Rio briefly wondered if he knew the fingers now clutching his wife’s arm had been inside of her if he’d change his mind on not caring about her crush.</p><p>He seemed to think on it, and his shoulders dropped a little.</p><p>“I was just getting back at you with the wine for Nicky, that’s all. He hasn’t taken the jersey off since he got it.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this, wondering why he was so concerned about this when he’d barely acknowledged his son a couple days ago.</p><p>But Agatha beneath her hand was still tense and so Rio shoved down her instincts to tell this guy to fuck off and to be a better dad if someone who’d known his kid all of one day could overtake him in the rankings. She swallowed thickly and squeezed Agatha’s arm as she said: “It’s fine. I’ve been called worse.”</p><p>“And,” she started slowly as Agatha shifted, “I don’t have a crush on your wife. I actually find her very smug and annoying and,” she paused as she felt Agatha’s arm flex beneath her hand, making her second guess her choice but she had to say it, had to do it for the sake of keeping the peace as well as letting Agatha know she’d keep their tryst safe, “and she’s not my type at all.”</p><p>Rio could feel both Alice and Jen looking at her and she saw Ralph do the same, but the only reaction she really cared about was Agatha’s, though she only had the gentle second flex of her arm to go by.</p><p>“Well I’m sorry,” Ralph said a little stiffly, and Rio wondered whether he was simply uncomfortable with the conversation of a lesbian’s preferences in women, if he wanted to get back to drinking his disgusting wine, or if he wanted to be thought of as the host again, take back the power that Agatha had so swiftly gathered for herself.</p><p>Rio only nodded once, not offering her forgiveness back and squeezed Agatha’s arm gently before she returned to her seat.</p><p>Silence descended on the little group again as Rio watched Agatha sit down, her face as angry still as she’d ever seen it.</p><p>It was touching, really, a display of protectiveness she would never have expected from Agatha.</p><p>Especially not now.</p><p>Or maybe it was something else. A self-preservation. A defensiveness.</p><p>And she didn’t take her eyes off of her until Agatha looked back up to her and Rio lost her nerve and looked away.</p><p>“Anyway,” Jen said quickly, still sitting on the edge of the couch where Alice had now stolen Rio’s free hand and was holding it hidden down against her own hip, looking a little shell shocked.</p><p>“Rio. Details. Industry crushes. Go!”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this and cleared her throat quietly, squeezing Alice’s hand reassuringly before stealing her own away again.</p><p>“Now that would be telling.”</p><p>“Oh come on,” Jen said with her own raised brows and a look that said to Rio: ‘please keep the conversation going’.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio relented, but only to get the conversation flowing again. She panicked and her mind went blank suddenly and she stared at Jen like she’d never been asked a question before in her life.</p><p>“Wanda,” Alice added quickly, nudging Rio’s thigh, “Wanda. You like Wanda.”</p><p>“Yes, but-…”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly, realising there was no point protesting when she had to come up with a name anyway and Alice had just done that for her.</p><p>“Wanda. Right.”</p><p>“The redhead?” Ralph asked curiously and Rio turned to him and nodded, feeling suddenly a little disloyal to Wanda and a whole lot disloyal to Agatha.</p><p>Despite what they’d just agreed in the kitchen.</p><p>But Ralph looked totally at ease again as if he hadn’t just insulted his guest and pissed off his wife.</p><p>Which infuriated Rio.</p><p>“She’s cute,” Jen was saying, which meant Rio had a chance to glance at Agatha who looked as if she’d just swallowed a very large pill as she drank down the last of her wine.</p><p>“She’s maybe going to be the only nomination for A24 this year. Sad, really. They had so much promise and just fucked it on all their marketing. Though the movie wasn’t great either.”</p><p>Agatha was staring at the table between them.</p><p>“We’re negotiating a little Christmas movie at the minute. Some big names attached, actually. Calderu, Kaplan, Maximoff, it’s an ensemble.”</p><p>“Oh god,” Jen scrunched her face up but Rio missed it, her gaze on Agatha still.</p><p>“Not the cancer one?”</p><p>“That’s it!”</p><p>“Cancer at Christmas. It’s poignant.”</p><p>“It’s crap. They sent it to Agatha but I passed immediately. Who’s Rio playing? Not part of the family surely? They’re all white.”</p><p>Before Alice could answer Agatha spoke for the first time since her last attempt to get Ralph to leave and she said, “Excuse me, I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Rio met Agatha’s gaze for a split second before she’d turned and left.</p><p>Her anger had morphed into something else, something that made Rio shift in her seat.</p><p>There was a pause and then Ralph followed her down and Rio didn’t turn away until they’d both disappeared into the house.</p><p>“Jesus, Rio. Are you okay?”</p><p>Alice turned to her immediately and placed her hand on her leg over where she’d been holding her so tightly earlier.</p><p>“He gets wound up,” Jen said softly, looking over at Rio with a gentle frown, “they both do. I tell Agatha she just needs to have sex with him more and they’ll be fine.”</p><p>Rio wondered if Jen knew how much sex Agatha were actually having with her husband but felt it best to not broach the topic.</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“I’m telling you, usually if things like that happen she screams at him until she runs out of breath. It was impressive, how you handled her.”</p><p>“I didn’t ‘handle’ her. I just…”</p><p>But Rio wasn’t really sure what she did and so she went quiet and took a sip of her wine.</p><p>“How she’s married to him, I don’t know.” Alice said with a deep frown as she turned in the direction Agatha and Ralph had disappeared to.</p><p>Jen sighed quietly, “Look, if it works it works, okay? He’s usually away and so is she and… anyway, her and Nicky are very happy.”</p><p><em> ‘Happily married’</em>, Rio thought bitterly.</p><p>“I saw a photo of him on the wall,” Alice said absently, swirling her wine, her frown still across her features, “he doesn’t look like Ralph.”</p><p>“Are you suggesting Agatha had an affair?”</p><p>“No, just, I thought he looked like Rio, actually.”</p><p>Rio blinked across at Alice and stared at her for longer than would be considered polite.</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Well he’s got dark eyes and a goofy smile and big buck teeth.”</p><p>“I do not have big buck teeth.”</p><p>Alice ignored this.</p><p>“Plus he’s a little tan and I just thought… yeah, there’s Rio’s kid.”</p><p>“That is-…”</p><p>“Now you mention it, it’s not that crazy,” Jen said with a frown, staring into Rio’s face as if she were mapping out what features of hers Nicky had stolen.</p><p>“Actually, not at all. Sure he’s not yours and Agatha didn’t just steal him?”</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>But a sudden movement from down the way alerted them to Agatha marching back up to them and Rio forgot all about their conversation as she entered the little secluded veranda.</p><p>“Ralph’s taking a work call.”</p><p>Rio didn’t believe this, and neither did the other two if their expressions were anything to go by.</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said with a smile, “we were just saying-…”</p><p>But she lost her train of thought as Agatha, instead of taking her chair back again, stood before Rio and hovered awkwardly there, earning a frown from Jen and raised brows from Rio.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio shook her head slightly, frowning up at Agatha who was almost leaning over her.</p><p>The look she’d noticed before hadn’t been sadness, it had been longing.</p><p>“It’s fine. He didn’t mean it.”</p><p>But Agatha pursed her lips and slowly pulled away, reaching to fill everyone’s glasses with the right wine.</p><p>Jen cleared her throat and started again: “Agatha, we were saying how much Nicky looks like Rio.”</p><p>A soft sound of glass on glass rang out as Agatha accidentally knocked the lip of the bottle on Rio’s wine glass.</p><p>“Well….”</p><p>“What do you mean ‘well’?”</p><p>Rio blinked across at Agatha and watched as she slowly turned to look up at her, “Well… he does.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Alice snorted beside her and Rio turned to slap her, “I’m sorry? Is everyone listening to themselves? Your son doesn’t look like me.”</p><p>“I mean, he does,” Jen said with an unhelpful grin.</p><p>“He does a little,” Agatha said with a smile that made Rio soften to it just a little, the memory of what Agatha had told her two nights ago making her chest suddenly feel warm.</p><p>“Big eyes, sallow skin, goofy teeth.”</p><p>“And since when have I had goofy teeth?”</p><p>Even Agatha laughed a little at this and despite Rio’s outrage, she couldn’t help but be pleased they were all laughing now, all at ease without Ralph there.</p><p><em>Prick.</em></p><p>So she played it up a little, shooting for the rafters with a performance that would have killed in any theatre up and down the country.</p><p>“Poor me, being told I have goofy teeth and look like a little boy.”</p><p>“Hey!” Agatha said with a small smile that had taken the edge off of her sad eyes, sitting back more in her seat to enjoy this little performance, “a very <em>cute</em> little boy.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and huffed heavily, receiving a nudge from Alice.</p><p>“At least you don’t need to bother having a kid now. Technically you already had one.”</p><p>“Oh, thanks.”</p><p>“I’m not sure Rio is the family type,” Jen said with a smirk, “given the amount of women she runs through.”</p><p>Jen turned her attention to Agatha, “Alice was telling me when she moved into her new house it was a new one every night for a week.”</p><p>“Jesus, Jen. Some discretion please.” Alice said suddenly, clearly concerned Rio’s penchant for running through girls would put Agatha off associating with her.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze was still on Rio and it had softened a little, the laughter in her face gone as she took her in, and Rio blushed a little bit didn’t turn away.</p><p>That was then, she thought. She’d never touch another woman for as long as she lived if Agatha asked her not to.</p><p>But she hadn’t. She wouldn’t.</p><p>It was none of Agatha’s concern what she’d do.</p><p>“I’m not saying it’s <em>bad</em>. I just think it’s not for Rio.”</p><p>“She was good with him,” Agatha said suddenly, breaking their gaze as she turned to Jen and Rio saw the sadness return in her. “Really good. Ralph’s right to be jealous about that. Nicky loved her. He doesn’t light up like that with his father.”</p><p>“I’m sure I was just new and exciting, that’s all.”</p><p>Agatha looked back to Rio and raised her brows at this show of modesty, tilting her head a little, “He’s not like that with most people. Anyone else, actually.”</p><p>“He likes me,” Jen protested with a frown.</p><p>“You scare him.”</p><p>“Oh. Because I wore a red light mask around him <em>one</em> time.”</p><p>Rio scoffed out a laugh and Alice grinned at her girlfriend. “You did not.”</p><p>“Good skin care waits for no one.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and Rio caught her eye. For a second, it was just the two of them again and Rio felt like moving over, taking Agatha’s hand and draping herself across her lap, curling around her.</p><p>She felt like asking her if she’d change her mind.</p><p>But Alice nudging her brought her back to real life and she turned with raised brows.</p><p>“Isn’t that right?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Plan: get Vidal a girlfriend.”</p><p>“Not this again. <em>Alice</em>.”</p><p>“Oh, shut up. It’s just us.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and felt her cheeks flush under Agatha’s intense gaze.</p><p>“Rio is going to get herself a girlfriend as soon as the awards season is done. She needs one. She’s getting old and lonely and it’s sad.”</p><p>Rio made a noise between a squeal and a scoff and slapped Alice’s arm. “Says the woman two months older than me who only just got a girlfriend.”</p><p>“That’s different.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“I was never lonely.”</p><p>“I am <em>not</em> lonely.”</p><p>“Tell us again how many women you had over the first week in your new place?”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes around at Jen and attempted to lean around Alice to slap her arm but Alice nudged her away with ease.</p><p>“So,” Jen said as if she hadn’t been interrupted. “How do you plan on getting this girlfriend?”</p><p>Rio turned slowly to Agatha and was surprised to see that she looked a little spaced.</p><p>“I’m not. I’m just going to-…”</p><p>“Start texting people back, firstly,” Alice said with a grin.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but caught Agatha’s arched brow and huffed a little, “I’m busy.”</p><p>“I think if you want a girlfriend Alice is right. You have to text people back.”</p><p>Rio blinked as Agatha looked back around to her and she suddenly wanted to scream. She suddenly wanted to shout at Agatha and tell her that it wouldn’t have mattered anyway because Agatha wasn’t interested.</p><p>But she didn’t. She couldn’t.</p><p>She dropped her gaze.</p><p>Agatha took a slow sip of her disgusting wine and inclined her head a little.</p><p>“I know if it were <em>me</em> you were trying to date then I would appreciate a text back.”</p><p><em>Pushing it</em>, Rio thought with a scowl.</p><p>“I think you’ve forgotten I don’t have a crush on you. So you don’t need to worry about me trying to date you. I’m not interested.”</p><p>Rio looked up then and caught a flash of emotion in Agatha’s gaze. A glimmer of hurt. Or of triumph. She wasn’t sure.</p><p>But Agatha hummed even as Alice piped up again and Rio began to wonder at what point her best friend had turned into a traitor.</p><p>“Oh, I’m afraid that’s a lie too.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“Oh you’re friends now. Ralph’s not here. Agatha, Rio <em>does</em> have a crush on you. She was all worried about it for a while but has calmed down now. I think seeing you in a bikini in Italy freaked her-…”</p><p>But Rio had slapped her friend’s arm and Jen was laughing beside her.</p><p>“Oh I think it’s clear she’s only interested in one thing. Right, Rio?”</p><p>Agatha asked softly and Rio heard the accusation in her tone and felt it deep within her bones.</p><p>She wanted to scream again.</p><p>Instead she sucked in her cheeks and watched as Agatha’s gaze fell from her, sweeping down to her hand that held the wine she’d given her and remaining there.</p><p>“But maybe Wanda doesn’t mind you picking up a different girl every night of the week.”</p><p>Rio bristled, not quite believing what Agatha was accusing her of. That she’d even suggest what she thought she was suggesting.</p><p>She turned away, deciding not to give Agatha the satisfaction.</p><p>Agatha had gone from furious to soft and then repeated the pattern again.</p><p>And Rio couldn’t get a grasp on it.</p><p>Agatha didn’t want her and yet she was pushing her further away when Rio had already agreed she’d step back, that it had been a mistake that wouldn’t be repeated.</p><p>From the corner of her eye she saw Agatha knock back her glass of wine.</p><p>“What are you guys doing?” Jen asked suddenly, lowering her wine glass from her lips and frowning deeply at the two of them.</p><p>“The vibes are off.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and flexed her jaw, unable to steady her racing heart and the anger that threatened to spill over.</p><p>“They’re just teasing, aren’t you, Rio?” Alice asked suddenly and Rio heard the pleading in her voice and looked around at her, managing only a quick nod.</p><p>But she couldn’t give anything else because her brain was going a mile a minute.</p><p>Agatha clearly thought she’d used her. A quick fuck and she was done.</p><p>How she’d come to that conclusion Rio had no idea but she couldn’t pry now.</p><p>She just had to silently take what she threw at her and focus on getting through the evening.</p><p>She could do it. She could do it for Alice.</p><p>Alice turned to look around at Jen and she smiled a little tensely, “Anyway, Wanda’s playing Rio’s wife in the Christmas movie Agatha turned down.”</p><p>“Oh? There weren’t any lesbians in that movie.”</p><p>“No,” Alice said with a shrug, “Wanda got the role and then asked if her husband could become her wife and… she got Rio hired.”</p><p>Rio was staring determinedly at her own knee now, only vaguely aware of the conversation around her and Agatha as she reached over to fill her own glass again.</p><p>“It’s cute actually,” Alice said with an innocent smile, “They’ve hired a kid who looks like Rio. Not as much as Nicky, obviously. Agatha, ever thought about putting Nicky to work?”</p><p>But Rio looked up now and saw the fury in Agatha’s gaze before she managed to school it somewhat, shaking her hair back and settling back in her armchair.</p><p>“Rio and Wanda? With my child?”</p><p>Oh, Agatha was mad as hell. And Rio felt a sick sort of satisfaction for it.</p><p>But more than that, she had to stop herself from grabbing her friend to get her to stop digging a hole.</p><p>But Alice was oblivious, seeing only the logic in it where Agatha was seeing none of it.</p><p>“Yeah! He looks like Rio, he <em>likes</em> Rio. It would be a win win!”</p><p>Rio was surprised that Agatha’s glass hadn’t snapped in two in her hand and her gaze fell to it briefly before she raised her eyes back up to Agatha’s face and she cleared her throat softly.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze flickered to her before she looked away and took a deliberate sip of her wine.</p><p>“Nicky isn’t interested in acting.”</p><p>Not a lie, Rio assumed. But not the reason Nicky wouldn’t be playing the role of her and Wanda’s child.</p><p>“The poor pressure on the kid,” Jen said with a smile, “Imagine he wasn’t as good as his mother. That he didn’t get two Oscar’s by the time he was forty.”</p><p>“One,” Alice murmured quietly and Rio arched a brow, tearing her attention away from Agatha to briefly glance at her best friend.</p><p>“Let’s not fight. We know it’ll be Agatha.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio said slowly, looking back to Agatha and watching curiously as she flexed a muscle in her jaw. “It won’t be either of us and someone else will win. Maybe Wanda.”</p><p>Blue eyes flashed around to meet Rio’s teasing brown and Rio couldn’t believe that she’d spent so long thinking that Agatha wasn’t interested when she was practically about to explode upon the mere mention of Wanda.</p><p>That even now, when Agatha had told her they couldn’t continue, she was still jealous.</p><p>It felt too good to be true. And yet. Agatha looked mutinous.</p><p>“Her movie was a mess and her publicity-…”</p><p>“The photos of us in Venice?”</p><p>Agatha shot Rio a warning look that Jen caught and she leant forwards in her chair, frowning at them both.</p><p>“Wait. What am I missing? The two of you… something’s going on.”</p><p>Agatha’s face morphed into something else then, something closed off and Rio bit down in her lip before looking over at Jen and feigning ignorance she asked: “What do you mean?”</p><p>“There’s… something I picked up in Italy. And it’s happening again only it’s… different.”</p><p>“Huh,” Rio said with a raised brow, shifting in her seat to turn her body slightly more towards Alice.</p><p>She felt a little uneasy about this assessment and shot a subtle look to Agatha who had handled this a lot better than her and had shaken her hair out behind her again, looking directly at her best friend with an unamused expression.</p><p>“Didn’t you tell me to be nice to Rio for Alice’s sake?”</p><p>This was news to Rio. News she didn’t exactly welcome.</p><p>But she knew Agatha was playing her role perfectly.</p><p>Jen bristled a little and even Alice frowned at this news.</p><p>“Well… I said be nice. I didn’t say-…”</p><p>“Didn’t say what, Jen? Invite Rio over for dinner so Alice would feel more comfortable?”</p><p>Rio fought the urge to fidget where she sat but she couldn’t give over any more power. She’d already lost so much that night.</p><p>And that hurt more than she’d been prepared for.</p><p>“Well… maybe I said it but…”</p><p>Alice sat forwards slightly and Rio cleared her throat, “I can leave if it’s easier on everyone.”</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Alice said quickly, and Rio saw the panic in her eyes as she turned to her, her warm hand now resting on Rio’s bare knee.</p><p>But Alice’s wasn’t the reaction she wanted to check.</p><p>She turned to Agatha and saw that her eyes were focused on Alice’s hand resting against Rio and if she didn’t know any better she might think she looked jealous.</p><p>“Agatha?” She asked suddenly, wanting to know if this was really futile, if she were truly unwanted and unwelcome. “Do you want me to leave?”</p><p>It felt the way moving through thick snow felt.</p><p>Your body warm, hot, too hot even with the effort of it. Your feet and legs heavy as they tried to power your body through. Your lips stinging with the cold even as your cheeks flushed a soft pink. And Rio felt it then. Felt the heat and the heaviness and the sting.</p><p>She felt the incremental movement of Agatha’s eyes as she dragged them from where Alice’s hand still rested on her knee, up Rio’s torso and eventually, blessedly, meeting her gaze.</p><p>Rio’s stomach flipped at the sight of her.</p><p>At the softness in her gaze, at the gentle way she was looking at her, so different from just two minutes ago, at the twitch of her fingers as they rested on the armrest, ever so slightly stretching towards her.</p><p>And she shook her head. Twitched it only an inch to the side. But it was a shake nonetheless.</p><p>Rio felt like a hand had been released from around her throat and she had to look away from Agatha again. Suddenly unsure if she should have even asked; thinking maybe she should have just left.</p><p>“Well,” Jen started again, frowning suspiciously at her best friend, “now that’s sorted, can we go back to having a nice time please?”</p><p>Alice squeezed Rio’s knee and shot her a confused look before she pulled her hand back and cleared her throat.</p><p>“So, <em>Heartburn</em> next, right? Rio was desperate for that. But I think you’ll be incredible. I mean… you always are.”</p><p>Rio glanced sideways at Alice and then was brave enough to look back to Agatha and saw her smile tensely, her whole demeanour completed changed again.</p><p>She looked lost in the conversation, her mind elsewhere and determinedly not looking at Rio.</p><p>And Rio kept up appearances for the next five minutes, nodding and smiling as the two beside her on the couch picked up the slack and Agatha contributed even a little.</p><p>But Rio needed some air and so excused herself to go to the bathroom, ignoring the look on Alice’s face as she did.</p><p>She didn’t turn around to see Agatha’s face.</p><p>She made it down to the house before she realised she was being followed and turned just in time for Alice’s hand to curl around her arm and for her to whisper urgently, “What’re you doing?”</p><p>Rio just shrugged out of her hold and finished the route to the ground floor bathroom.</p><p>Once inside, with Alice slipping in behind her, she sighed heavily, “Nothing. Nothing’s happening.”</p><p>“It is. I thought you and Agatha were good. You both look distraught.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and went to the mirror, and saw some of what Alice was saying. She’d looked happier. She’d looked better.</p><p>“Rio, what happened?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“Fine. Don’t tell me. Whatever. But please, whatever it is, try to fix it. We’re in <em>such</em> a good position with Agatha on side. Just… sort it out.”</p><p>Rio sighed again and dropped her head as Alice left her alone in the bathroom.</p><p>There was no use. It was pointless to think that she’d be able to fix this. She’d tried to reassure Agatha that her secret was safe with her and yet Agatha was lashing out, and then freezing her out completely and watching her like she’d been the one to break this off.</p><p>Like Rio was to blame.</p><p>Agatha was angry and sad and Rio didn’t know how to fix it because she felt exactly the same.</p><p>Only she couldn’t lash out because that would draw even more attention to it and Rio had already promised that what had happened between them would be safe as houses with her.</p><p>She wondered if she had just text back what might have been. Would Agatha have still pulled away? Still acted like she despised her?</p><p>But Rio Vidal hadn’t made it to where she was by cowering away.</p><p>She brushed down her dress and ran a hand through her hair and took one last look at herself before she stepped from the bathroom and strode back out.</p><p>She found that everyone had migrated to the kitchen, and even Ralph had made his unwelcome presence known again. Everyone was sat around the island with Agatha the other side chopping up leeks.</p><p>She didn’t look up when Rio entered the room.</p><p>“Ah the prodigal actress has returned,” Jen called out with a smirk, and Ralph hurried from his stool to offer it to Rio.</p><p>She wanted to refuse but suddenly she felt Agatha’s eyes on her again and so she took it, if only to keep the peace.</p><p>“Did I miss anything?”</p><p>Alice passed Rio her glass that she’d saved from outside and Rio accepted it with a small smile, taking a large sip to try and calm the nerves that were again bubbling in her chest.</p><p>“No, just-…”</p><p>The soft music playing in the background filtered into Rio’s conscious then as the infamous chords struck up.</p><p>The world slowed and Rio’s gaze landed on Agatha and she saw that she’d recognised it too.</p><p>Her knife slipped and she cut a gash in her right thumb as Lindsey Buckingham’s voice filled the room.</p><p><em>“Loving you, isn’t the right thing to do.”</em></p><p>Rio stood as Agatha gasped and raised her bleeding thumb to her mouth to quell the bleed and she moved around to take her to the sink and help her rinse it.</p><p>“Ah! Rio, I’m fine.”</p><p>“Here,” Rio insisted calmly, barely thinking as she held Agatha’s hand gently under the cool water.</p><p>“Just rinse it.”</p><p>“You okay, hon?” Ralph asked from somewhere behind them and Rio felt sick as Agatha’s fingers curled around her own.</p><p>“Fine. Turn the damn song off,” Agatha huffed, even as her hold remained gentle against Rio.</p><p>Rio glanced at her before she pulled away and saw that Agatha looked far from the distant and angry she’d seemed earlier and instead looked pained. And Rio didn’t think it was because of the cut.</p><p>“Bandaids?” She asked quietly, only vaguely aware that the song had now changed and talk had picked up behind them.</p><p>“Second drawer on the right.”</p><p>Rio nodded and went to dry her hands on a dish cloth nearby before she sought a bandaid in a neatly laid out drawer.</p><p>She initially grabbed a normal looking box full of them and then spotted a second box with different images on it and smiled to herself as she rummaged to find what she was looking for.</p><p>She returned to Agatha’s side with a paper towel to help dry the area and the special bandaid she’d picked for the occasion.</p><p>Agatha winced a little at the light pressure of the towel against the small cut but Rio mumbled, “It should heal quickly. It’ll just sting for a bit.”</p><p>“You seem to know an awful lot about first aid.”</p><p>“Grew up with permanently grazed knees.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and Rio caught her smiling a little before her gaze dropped to the bandaid now half on her thumb.</p><p>“<em>Rio.</em>”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I have an Oscar.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Those are Nicky’s.”</p><p>“Then he has good taste.”</p><p>Rio lifted Agatha’s hand to inspect her handiwork and smirked up at Agatha, looking past her new addition to her thumb of a bandaid covered in cowboy hats and grinning at her.</p><p>“Juvenile.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Rio had to resist the urge to kiss the patient and instead behaved herself and released Agatha’s hand to return to her stool, making brief eye contact with Agatha again before she took a sip of wine.</p><p>The rush of being close, of touching Agatha was unlike anything else she’d ever felt before.</p><p>And she now found it difficult to look away.</p><p>The power of Fleetwood Mac and the witchy wonder of a song written for Stevie Nicks having cast a spell that broke the tension between them, that seemed to bring Agatha back out of herself, that made Rio wonder if she’d maybe change her mind and if Rio would allow it.</p><p>But she took another sip of wine and her eyes fell to Agatha’s thumb now sporting the cowboy bandaid and she knew she’d allow it.</p><p>She’d beg for it if she had to.</p><p>But she kept herself from looking at Agatha properly again as the conversation picked back up and Rio began to relax.</p><p>Maybe it was the wine.</p><p>Maybe it was the promise that maybe hope wasn’t dead.</p><p>Maybe it was that in spite of everything that had happened that night, Agatha had kept her promise of Rio sitting next to her at the table.</p><p>The excuse was that from this positioning it would be easier for her to get up to serve the food and easier for Ralph to fetch the wine.</p><p>Though Rio’s seat would have been good enough for either of these tasks.</p><p>No one said anything. Rio because she wanted to sit beside Agatha, Ralph because he wanted to sit at the head of the table, and Alice and Jen because all they cared about was sitting together.</p><p>Rio managed to keep her end of the shared conversation up, managed to not let the side down or Alice down.</p><p>The food was plentiful and <em>good</em>. Agatha, despite her minor injury, had made a puy lentil dish with roasted chicken thighs and Rio wondered if there was anything she wasn’t good at because she was three for three right now.</p><p>Acting, cooking, fucking.</p><p>But when it was time for more wine to be poured and dessert to be offered Rio felt a hand against her thigh and she had been so focused on watching Ralph stand after cracking a stupid joke about doing the hardest job at the table “keeping the glasses filled” that she jumped in her seat and whacked her knee against the underside of the table.</p><p>Everyone turned to look at her and even Ralph’s smile faded as he eyed Rio curiously.</p><p>“What the fuck, Vidal?” Jen asked with a scowl as Rio blushed furiously and cleared her throat, aware of the dangerous territory she’d just placed herself and Agatha in.</p><p>“Ever get one of those weird shivers?” She asked, pulling it straight out of her ass.</p><p>“I had an old friend say they happened when someone walked over your grave.”</p><p>“Riiiight,” Jen said slowly, toying with the stem of her empty glass.</p><p>Alice just scoffed out a laugh and shook her head in amusement, but kept her gaze on Rio as she settled down a little and rubbed at her knee with a frown.</p><p>Agatha didn’t make another move again until after the final bites of key lime pie had been eaten and the bowls pushed away from the happy diners and they sat and luxuriated in their fullness for a while, now all happily talking about their plans for the next little while with filming picking up for both Rio and Agatha soon.</p><p>It happened more cautiously this time, with Agatha shifting her seat a little under the pretence of getting closer to the table.</p><p>She’d brushed her fingers along the side of Rio’s thigh as she pulled back in and Rio cleared her throat quietly as she adjusted her weight to lean forwards on her elbows, providing slightly more cover if Agatha were to try again.</p><p>She didn’t. Not until Alice said that they should probably be going.</p><p>“No, stay,” Agatha said with a frown, her hand reaching out to brush Rio’s leg again even as she kept her gaze on Alice.</p><p>“It’s not that late.”</p><p>“I know but,” Alice started but Jen finished for her: “Agatha, Alice is leaving for months in two days. No offence and this was lovely but I’d like some alone time with her if you know what I mean.”</p><p>Rio laughed and Alice rolled her eyes at her but looked thrilled all the same.</p><p>Agatha’s hand pulled away and Rio felt like she could breathe properly again.</p><p>“I should get going too. But can I help with anything?”</p><p>Alice raised her brows at this offer but said nothing as she pushed her chair back and Jen did too.</p><p>“No, nothing.”</p><p>It was the first time Agatha had properly addressed Rio since the thumb incident earlier and Rio turned to look at her, seeing the softness return where she’d earlier assumed she’d never get to see that from Agatha again.</p><p>But she had to look away, had to keep playing her role.</p><p>So she stood with the others and they all made their way to the centre of the house, grabbing bags and keys and Rio hung back as the others said their goodbyes.</p><p>She couldn’t bring herself to be embraced by Ralph so she was quick to offer her hand, and shook it firmly even as he blinked in surprise at her.</p><p>But then she turned to Agatha and before thinking much she wrapped her arms around her and heard a soft whisper in her ear: “Get home safe.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only smile falsely as she turned away for fear she’d ask to stay.</p><p>And when she hit the cooler air of the late night with Jen and Alice in tow she sucked in a heavy breath, and tried to calm her traitorous heart as it screamed at her to turn around and take one last look at Agatha Harkness.</p>

<p>Rio woke with a headache.</p><p>One she knew wasn’t due to the amount of wine she’d had the night before.</p><p>One she knew was everything to do with heartache.</p><p>Falling for a married woman was never going to be a good idea.</p><p>Falling for Agatha Harkness was always going to be the <em>worst</em> idea.</p><p>She flung her arm out from the safety of the covers and found her phone on the side. It was 9:30am, just late enough to be considered a lie in, just early enough for Rio to want to turn over and stay in bed.</p><p>But this was her final day before she had to fly to Toronto tomorrow. And with a pang she realised that this time tomorrow she’d be landing soon.</p><p>Shaking the impending travel day with Alice barking orders in her ear and inevitably questioning her on the Agatha situation, she forced herself to get up and take a shower.</p><p>The water helped. The heat helped.</p><p>She stepped from it reluctantly, deciding a huge water bill wasn’t something she wanted to add to her troubles.</p><p>Her mind was on the chores she had to do today because as mindless and dull as they were, they at least took up the space sorrowful blue eyes and tentative touches were currently taking.</p><p>But there was a noise.</p><p>A loud noise that sounded like her front door opening.</p><p>Alice.</p><p>She groaned and grabbed a towel from the side, snaking it around herself and tucking it in tightly above her left breast.</p><p>She brushed her wet hair back with a ridiculous brush that her hair stylist had once gifted her and promised it would help to keep her locks ‘shiny and sleek’. She wasn’t sure what that meant or how a brush could manage it but she liked the guy so now had incorporated the brush into her daily routine.</p><p>It was as she placed the brush down that she heard her bedroom door open and promptly close.</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>And then, there was silence.</p><p>Alice was never silent.</p><p>Instinctively, her fingers curled around the brush again and she remained still, listening intently for any sign that Alice was simply speaking to her but quietly, which in itself would be unusual.</p><p>Deciding she had to face the music whether it was a man in a balaclava or her annoyed best friend, she ripped the door open and came face to face with someone she wasn’t expecting.</p><p>The expensive magic brush slipped from her fingers and she gaped at the sight before her.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was standing just a foot from the bathroom door, looking a little surprised herself that she were there.</p><p>And Rio thought her heart would never recover from the shock.</p><p>Not to mention the cruel way Agatha had decided to dress for the occasion.</p><p>She stood, brazen and bold, in a matching lilac gym set: a sports bra and leggings. Her hair was loose about her shoulders and she carried a light tote bag over her shoulder.</p><p>“You leave your front door unlocked?”</p><p>Rio blinked, her eyes darting up from where they’d been admiring the sight of toned thighs beneath the stretchy fabric of Agatha’s leggings.</p><p>“I locked it.”</p><p>“Clearly not.”</p><p>“You took it as an invitation to just… walk in?”</p><p>“I knocked,” Agatha said as if that were any excuse for walking into someone’s home.</p><p>Rio had so many questions, had so many things she needed to say, that being so full with words she found herself unable to say any of them.</p><p>It felt like her brain had short circuited. That one of her many fantasies she’d had about Agatha Harkness being in her bedroom had accidentally spilled into real life.</p><p>“I wanted to see you before you left,” Agatha offered as if she’d plucked one of the questions from Rio’s swirling brain and decided to answer it.</p><p>Rio’s mouth was open and she closed it quickly, aware she looked a little dumb standing silently with dripping hair and in a damp towel.</p><p>“How did you find out where I lived?”</p><p>Not the most important question, but one she was able to form.</p><p>Agatha’s brow quirked, as if she too knew this wasn’t exactly the question Rio wanted to ask.</p><p>“Jen.”</p><p>Rio nodded just once and swallowed, feeling a blush creep up her cheeks as her eyes dropped to the abs on display before her.</p><p>“Are you going for a workout?”</p><p>“Pilates. At ten.”</p><p>And Rio nodded again, forcing herself to look at the floor to try and sort her scrambled brain. But all she could think about was how lucky the rest of Agatha’s Pilates class were to see her dressed like this, bending and stretching and holding. It made her want to die.</p><p>Agatha took a step closer, and Rio’s eyes darted to the bag that she dropped by her feet as she did.</p><p>“I wanted to talk to you,” Agatha said, quieter this time.</p><p>“I think you said everything you wanted to yesterday.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and raised her gaze to Agatha again, seeing a brief flicker of fear in blue eyes before it disappeared and she instead looked soft again.</p><p>Much softer than she’d looked when she was telling Rio it was over. That it had been a mistake.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer and Rio sucked in a breath, moving so her back was against the frame of the bathroom door and her chin raised to challenge Agatha.</p><p>But she didn’t back down.</p><p>She stepped in and placed a hand on Rio’s cheek, her fingers just grazing the wet hair on the side of her head and her thumb tracing over still damp skin.</p><p>Rio felt the fire ignite in her again. She felt the pull of Agatha tighten its silky promise around her heart and she leant into her touch without meaning to, even as her mind caught up and said the lie she’d been telling herself since entering Agatha’s home yesterday evening:</p><p>“You were right yesterday. It was a mistake.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed slightly, even as her free hand moved up to hold Rio’s face properly, her touch so warm and welcome that Rio almost melted into her.</p><p>Her hands betrayed her and moved so her fingers could rest gently at Agatha’s hips and she sucked in a soft breath at the feel of her skin above the waistband of her leggings.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted and Rio’s gaze fell to them, wondering if she’d ever see lips so perfect again, so beautifully crafted and so soft to the touch.</p><p>“A mistake I won’t make with anyone else. And a mistake I’d like to make properly, with you.”</p><p>Rio was shaken from her reverie, pulled back into her body as she raised her gaze to Agatha’s blue eyes, seeing an earnestness there that for now, at least, was all she needed to incline her head ever so slightly.</p><p>Even in her petulant mood the night before, she wouldn’t have denied Agatha.</p><p>But Agatha gave her a second’s grace in case she changed her mind. But her lips were now parted and blue eyes were now on Rio’s lips.</p><p>Rio breathed in slowly as Agatha closed the distance between them.</p><p>It was different this time, kissing Agatha.</p><p>It wasn’t new or frightening. Or rushed and soft. It was needy and desperate.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers moved to hold Rio’s head and Rio’s wrapped firmly around Agatha’s hips to press them flush together.</p><p>And Rio moaned unwittingly when she tasted Agatha’s tongue again for the first time since their dalliance on the couch.</p><p>But she didn’t have to be quiet anymore.</p><p>And Agatha clearly didn’t want her to be if the press of her hips or the nails digging into her scalp were anything to go by.</p><p>Rio’s hands moved down to grip Agatha’s ass at the same time that Agatha introduced her teeth to Rio’s lips and bit down harshly and Rio moaned as she opened her eyes to see Agatha looking at her with eyes the colour of midnight.</p><p>“Fuck,” she mumbled as Agatha released her lip and went to soothe it with the tip of her tongue.</p><p>It made Rio tremble and Agatha moved her damp hands down her jaw, trailing her throat and then her chest until her fingers dipped into her towel and she tugged it down.</p><p>The white fabric pooled between them, gathering where their hips still met and exposing just Rio’s torso.</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath when Agatha’s hands fell to her breasts and she watched as Agatha watched her react to every light touch of her fingers there.</p><p>“Get on the bed,” she said softly, and Rio had to fight the whimper that threatened to escape her swollen lips as Agatha pulled back, her fingers still on her breasts until the very last second where she broke Rio’s hold on her and let the towel fall to the floor between them.</p><p>Rio only nodded, allowing for a second Agatha’s gaze to take in her naked form before she took her hand and pulled her to the unmade bed with her.</p><p>She sat on the edge and pulled Agatha between her open legs, tugging her until her knees were knocking the mattress and Rio was just inches from her abdomen.</p><p>“Like this?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond and instead dropped Rio’s hand to cross her arms over herself and lift her sports bra from her body.</p><p>She threw it behind her and Rio’s mouth fell open at the sight before her.</p><p>She reacted immediately, her hands flying to Agatha’s waist as she leant up, seeking the taste of Agatha’s perfect breasts in her hungry mouth.</p><p>But as her lips brushed the soft skin across Agatha’s ribs she made a soft noise of complaint and pushed Rio away, applying enough pressure to her shoulders to get her to lie down.</p><p>“Agatha,” she protested with a frown, leaning up on her elbows to watch as Agatha stepped back a little and began to slip out of her tight leggings.</p><p>“Move back. Lay down properly.”</p><p>Unable to understand let alone fulfil the instructions now Agatha was standing proudly, gloriously naked before her, Rio simply stayed still, free eyes roaming all over the exposed body of the woman she’d crawl over hot coals for.</p><p>“Fuck me,” she muttered softly, barely able to keep it together when Agatha stepped closer and placed her hands back on Rio’s face.</p><p>“Lay down, Rio. I want to taste you.”</p><p>The whimper Rio had held in before now escaped her lips and Agatha smiled because of it, her the thumb of her left hand moving down to brush across Rio’s lower lip.</p><p>“Move,” she said softly, still gazing at Rio’s mouth as it opened for her and she pressed the tip of her thumb in to meet Rio’s curious tongue.</p><p>“Now.”</p><p>Rio had to fight the urge to not comply. She had to force herself to pull away, to put distance between them when she wanted Agatha all over her, immediately, forever.</p><p>But she pushed herself back, choosing to turn and crawl rather than shuffle, and she lay her head against her pillow, watching Agatha copy her movements as she crawled onto the bed, and over her body.</p><p>Agatha hovered above her and Rio fought the shiver that threatened to give away her desperation. Her hands raised to Agatha’s waist again and she felt goosebumps rise there where she trailed her fingers along the soft ridges of her ribs.</p><p>But she couldn’t look away from the blue eyes of the woman above her. Agatha’s hair created a curtain between them and the outside world and Rio felt suddenly shy from the intimacy of the position they were in.</p><p>They were barley touching, but she could feel the heat from Agatha’s body all over her. She could feel the soft breaths of the older woman against her parted lips. She could see the same shyness suddenly reflected back at her in eyes so dark she could lose herself in them.</p><p>Agatha ducked her head down and unlike the intensity of the kiss before, she nudged their noses lightly, making Rio’s heart hammer from something other than desire.</p><p>“You’re perfect,” Agatha whispered quietly against Rio’s lips, capturing the words between them as she kissed Rio slowly, softly, only pressing her tongue into Rio’s mouth with a tender movement as her left hand moved to cup Rio’s breast.</p><p>Rio moaned, arching up a little into the hold as she struggled to keep a grasp on her desire to have more of Agatha.</p><p>She tugged at her upper body, wanting Agatha to press against her, and when she did, when her hand moved away and their breasts met for the first time Rio wondered how she’d spend the rest of her life unable to feel like this again.</p><p>Agatha was now flush against her, and she wrapped her legs around her hips to trap her there.</p><p>But Agatha was groaning quietly, moving away already, shifting her weight and breaking Rio’s hold.</p><p>Her tenderness had disappeared as she became hungry once more and hot lips and teeth and tongue were exploring the trail down to Rio’s breasts.</p><p>Agatha replaced her hand back on one and her mouth on the other and Rio no longer had to guess whether Agatha was going to be shy.</p><p>She wrapped her whole mouth over Rio’s right breast and sucked hard as Rio arched into her and moaned out.</p><p>Agatha slipped her free arm beneath her back and held her in place as she sucked and teased and licked her breast.</p><p>Her left hand groped until she swapped, paying Rio’s other breast an equal amount of attention and making Rio feel more desperate than she ever had in her life.</p><p>“Agatha,” she groaned quietly, her back arched up impossibly and her hands now scratching at Agatha’s back.</p><p>And Agatha pulled away with a soft <em>pop</em> as she released Rio’s nipple, her hand still squeezing over Rio’s other breast as she looked up at her.</p><p>Rio knew this angle wouldn’t be good, knew she’d look desperate and wild, but she had to look down at Agatha and see her lying over her like that, her eyes dark and lips swollen.</p><p>The sight took her breath away.</p><p>Agatha was panting softly, her fingers still curled over Rio’s breast, her lips just inches above her sternum.</p><p>And she was looking at Rio so openly, so expectantly, as if she’d been doing this for years and had never really thought it were unusual or new and Rio’s wide-eyed gaze was reminding her that this was new for both of them.</p><p>Rio’s fingers began swirling a softer pattern between Agatha’s shoulder blades and she licked her lips as Agatha returned her attention to her body, pressing soft and slow kisses until just above her belly button where she stopped and held Rio’s hips firmly.</p><p>Rio swallowed and raised up to her elbows and the shift made Agatha look up again.</p><p>“You don’t have to,” she said quietly, her brow furrowing where she realised what Agatha was about to do and that in her haste she’d not stopped to think logically.</p><p>Because Rio was the first woman Agatha had been with. And Rio wanted to make sure she felt safe and comfortable because clearly Ralph wasn’t the kind of man to do that for his wife.</p><p>So Rio would step up and provide it.</p><p>“It’s okay,” she added, “I mean if you don’t want to it’s okay.”</p><p>Agatha had dropped her gaze and pressed her lips back against Rio’s stomach, holding there for a second before she pulled back to whisper, “It’s all I want.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and could only watch as Agatha moved slowly down, her face close to her body but no longer making contact.</p><p>And then she was settling properly between her legs, her hands still at Rio’s hips, her gaze down before her and Rio had to fight off another whimper.</p><p>She’d parted her legs a little more so Agatha could lay between them comfortably; feeling more exposed and suddenly shy at being so on display for the goddess between her thighs.</p><p>Agatha moved her hands slowly down to her thighs and pushed them to get Rio to stretch them further, and Rio bit her lip where she looked down at Agatha, seeing her take the sight before her in.</p><p>Agatha’s thumb grazing her inner thigh was the only warning she got before she felt her warmth breath against her.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath so audible that Agatha’s eyes flickered up to her as her tongue came into contact with her pussy for the first time.</p><p>Rio almost came on the spot.</p><p>Agatha had moaned as just the tip of her tongue slipped through Rio’s soaked folds and Rio saw stars as the anticipation of what it would feel like to have Agatha eating her out properly hit home.</p><p>But Agatha had pulled back again and her gaze had dropped from Rio’s and Rio wanted to lift her hips, wanted to encourage Agatha to do more, to go faster.</p><p>But she held steady, for fear if she pushed Agatha would pull away.</p><p>But Agatha was adjusting, calculating, working out how best to do what she needed so desperately to do.</p><p>And Rio was compliant as she lifted her thighs to help Agatha wrap her arms underneath them.</p><p>She was still and silent when Agatha kissed along her sensitive skin on her inner right thigh, and she even controlled her volume when she felt Agatha’s breath against her core once more.</p><p>Agatha’s hold on her tightened and her tongue this time wasn’t as tame in its exploration.</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha closed her eyes and pressed herself fully against her and Rio whined as Agatha began to eat her out, slowly but greedily.</p><p>She explored her with confident strokes, tasted every inch of her and swirled her tongue until Rio’s moans were so frequent that she developed a rhythm that was so expertly enacted that Rio almost came from just Agatha’s explorations.</p><p>But a movement lower down, Agatha’s tongue seeking her entrance and the angle made Agatha’s nose press in and brush Rio’s clit and Rio bucked her hips without warning.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shot open and she looked up at Rio, pausing her movements until Rio’s breathing evened out a little and she pulled her tongue back up slowly, curiously watching Rio’s reaction.</p><p>“Baby,” Rio pleaded gently, until her plea was replaced by a low groan when Agatha found her clit again with her tongue and pressed her lips around it to suck.</p><p>Rio fell from her elbows and clutched at the sheets as Agatha applied enough pressure to drive her to the edges of sanity.</p><p>Agatha continued her assault against her clit, using Rio’s twitches and moans to find her rhythm, to determine whether her lips or tongue would help her achieve her goal and soon Rio came with a cry of Agatha’s name and her hips rocking up into a waiting mouth.</p><p>Agatha pulled away only to catch her breath, only to shift her arm so she could rest her hand on Rio’s abdomen, only so she could stare down at the meal she’d just made of Rio’s pussy.</p><p>Rio couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. Even with eyes open she couldn’t see.</p><p>But then, she felt Agatha’s fingers against her and she whimpered as she forced herself up to look down at Agatha.</p><p>Blue eyes raised to hers and Rio moaned quietly at the vision before her.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t been shy in her exploring. She hadn’t worried about being delicate or neat. And evidence of that was all over her face.</p><p>Agatha seemed to understand why Rio was staring the way she was and her tongue darted out to lick her lips as she pressed her fingers down and inside of her, making Rio groan quietly as she kept eye contact with Agatha.</p><p>She felt more confident that Agatha wouldn’t pull away now and she forced her legs open a little more, watching as midnight blue eyes fell between them again and she felt Agatha curl her fingers inside her.</p><p>“Fuck,” she whispered quietly, her hips rocking with every slow thrust until Agatha returned her lips to her cunt, pressing a slow openmouthed kiss to her swollen clit.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t just a virtuoso. She was a revelation.</p><p>Rio had been with countless women. All shapes and sizes and personalities and experience levels.</p><p>And yet none of them turned her on this much.</p><p>None of them made her feel so delirious she felt high with it.</p><p>None of them made her moan so frequently or as effortlessly as Agatha did.</p><p>She came in no time at all, so worked up and sensitive with Agatha’s mouth against her and fingers buried deep inside of her.</p><p>Only when able to come back to herself did she push Agatha away, looking down to see Agatha still urgently trying for more.</p><p>“Agatha, Agatha. Stop, stop.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away properly, her fingers stilling inside of her before they slowly pulled out.</p><p>“I’m not done.”</p><p>A slow grin crept up Rio’s face that transformed into a laugh and she reached her hands down from Agatha’s head to cup her jaw, “Come here.”</p><p>“I said I wasn’t done,” Agatha insisted, a husk in her voice that wasn’t there before.</p><p>And Rio wanted to give in. She could have selfishly kept Agatha between her thighs for decades and never been sick of it but she had another desire that overrode that one. She wanted to feel what eating her out had done to Agatha.</p><p>“Come here,” she said again, stronger this time as she applied pressure to Agatha’s jaw.</p><p>Agatha lifted her chin and remained still for a second before she began to slowly move back along Rio’s body, pressing damp kisses between her breasts until she was hovering over her again.</p><p>Rio grinned where Agatha frowned.</p><p>“Kiss me.”</p><p>Agatha eyed Rio for a second before she closed the gap between them and Rio tasted herself on Agatha’s tongue for the first time.</p><p>It was a euphoria like no other.</p><p>A miraculous thing that made her hungry again and she pressed up and into Agatha as she reached down between them to find what she needed to desperately know.</p><p>She hit Agatha’s inner thighs first and found them slick with her desire, trailing her fingers teasingly higher until she could cup Agatha’s pussy and feel the mess she’d already made.</p><p>“No, no,” she groaned softly as she pulled away, nudging Agatha’s face from her own as she pulled her hand back and began to wrestle them over.</p><p>“I need you to come against my mouth. I need to taste you.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to protest but Rio had already flipped them, was already making quick work of scrambling down Agatha’s body to slip between her legs.</p><p>She sucked in a breath at the musky, heavenly scent of Agatha before she felt hands on her head, firm and heavy and Agatha’s voice, louder, firmer, no longer as husky or needy.</p><p>“Wait, Rio. I’m not-…”</p><p>The wind was knocked out of Rio’s sails and she relented beneath her still firm hold, pulling back so Agatha wouldn’t have to worry and she raised slowly to her knees, pulling away to give Agatha the space she clearly needed.</p><p>“I’ve had a baby, Rio.”</p><p>Rio blinked because whatever she was expecting Agatha to say, it wasn’t that.</p><p>But Agatha was raising to her elbows now, her whole face twisting into something that looked a lot to Rio like shame.</p><p>And it didn’t sit well with her. Not at all.</p><p>And so Rio crawled back up Agatha’s body and knocked her elbows out so she would lay flat and Rio could bracket her head with her forearms.</p><p>“You,” she said quietly, confidently, slowly lowering herself on top of Agatha.</p><p>“Are,” she said with a small smile as she took Agatha’s arms wrapping around her waist to be a good sign that she wasn’t pulling away entirely.</p><p>“The hottest,” she pressed a small kiss to the tip of Agatha’s nose.</p><p>“Most breathtaking woman, I have ever seen.”</p><p>She pressed a kiss to her lips that Agatha returned.</p><p>“I’m just saying,” Agatha said quietly, her frown still marring her features, “I look different.”</p><p>“You look <em>incredible</em>. And if you’ll let me I’d really like to see how incredible you taste.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips but her arms went slack around Rio and Rio took this as an ‘okay’.</p><p>She pulled back and went slower this time, tempering her own desire so that Agatha knew she was more into her than she could even say.</p><p>She kissed every inch of Agatha’s body until Agatha was squirming beneath her with want.</p><p>“Rio,” she husked out and Rio grinned against Agatha’s hip bone, pleased her blip of fear was just that: a blip.</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“Will you just goddamn get to it.”</p><p>“Get to what?”</p><p>Rio kissed her again.</p><p>“<em>Rio.</em>”</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Rio looked up just in time to see Agatha raising to her elbows, a pretty flush against her cheeks and all fear gone from her gaze as she glared down at Rio’s shit-eating grin.</p><p>“Eat me out or so help me god…”</p><p>Rio could only continue grinning, and she turned back down to kiss a slow trail to the little patch of hairs at the apex of Agatha’s pussy.</p><p>She hummed from low in her chest, raising her gaze to see Agatha staring down at her, her chest already heaving and her pupils blown as she watched Rio dip her mouth down and slide her tongue in to brush alongside her clit.</p><p>Rio moaned alongside Agatha at the taste of her.</p><p>Heady and somehow sweet, she knew instantly that she’d have to be pried away from her to ever be able to stop.</p><p>Agatha was already on her back again and Rio was unsurprised when her hips began to rock down against her as she ate her out feverishly, each stroke of her tongue making her desperate for more.</p><p>But Agatha took her by surprise when she came against her with a scream, her hips bucking harshly into Rio’s willing face as Rio’s tongue fought to keep contact with her clit.</p><p>Two things Rio now knew for sure about Agatha Harkness: she came quickly, and she came loudly.</p><p>She’d known the first already but the second would have been impossible to know given the last time she’d made her come a sleeping child had been just upstairs.</p><p>But Rio didn’t pull away to let Agatha come down or to take a breath.</p><p>She simply continued her explorations, dipping lower to allow Agatha’s rocking hips to ride her tongue.</p><p>She used every trick she knew and soon found herself reaching down between her own thighs just for some sort of release.</p><p>But Agatha came again before Rio could relieve some of the building tension for herself and she focused on letting Agatha rock against her as she moaned and twitched on the bed.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio. Fuck. I-…”</p><p>Rio grinned as she slowly pulled away, lifting the hand she’d just had inside herself to press a finger slowly inside Agatha and causing her to groan quietly.</p><p>“We need to build you up,” Rio said, half mumbling now against Agatha’s inner thigh, “You’re so sensitive.”</p><p>Agatha only moaned quietly, huffing out a breath of frustration when Rio pulled out of her.</p><p>“Are you telling me,” Agatha began, still catching her breath as Rio began to kiss her way back up to her lips, “that you’re not incredibly smug that I come so quickly for you.”</p><p>Rio grinned and even Agatha smiled a little as she gazed up at her, “Maybe I am. Sue me.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes and began to trail her fingers slowly up and down Rio’s sides.</p><p>“You’re so incredibly irritating.”</p><p>Rio laughed and leant in to kiss Agatha, nipping gently at her lower lip, “You don’t mean that.”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>Rio hummed and kissed her again, “Maybe if I go down on you again you’ll change your mind.”</p><p>She made to move but Agatha held her firmly, “Actually, I was hoping you’d sit on my face.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and moved a hand to Agatha’s cheek, watching her in silence for a second, her eyes darting to the lips that turned to kiss at her palm.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“Stop treating me like I don’t know what I want.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and nodded silently, her gaze dropping absently to Agatha’s swollen lips.</p><p>But Agatha was keener than she realised and she was now clutching at her, clawing at her back to make her move, reaching down to grab her ass and heave her up the bed.</p><p>And Rio obliged. She shuffled up and waited for Agatha to nod up at her slightly until she placed her knees either side of Agatha’s head.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha chastised, her arms curling around Rio’s thighs, “Sit.”</p><p>Rio felt her stomach flip at the instruction and she lowered herself at Agatha’s pace as she pulled her down against her.</p><p>Rio’s breath was taken away by the eagerness of Agatha’s mouth against her again.</p><p>And this time she was unable to stop herself from rocking against her, grinding in a slow rhythm as Agatha moaned beneath her.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and found herself suddenly desperate to hear Agatha’s louder moans again, to feel them against her core.</p><p>She moved cautiously to hold her own weight, worried about crushing Agatha as she did.</p><p>But she adjusted herself and leant back to press her fingers against Agatha’s pussy, scissoring around her clit as she felt the first of Agatha’s true moans vibrate through her.</p><p>Rio’s eyes closed at the sound and the feel of Agatha practically vibrating beneath her and she had to focus hard to keep herself steady and her hand working Agatha up as quickly as she possibly could.</p><p>She’d been right to guess that it wouldn’t take long.</p><p>And Agatha came against her hand so violently that if it weren’t for Agatha’s firm hold around her thighs Rio might have fallen right off.</p><p>Rio kept her fingers teasing Agatha, enjoying the small jolts of her hips against her that matched the pressure of her tongue against her own clit and not long after Agatha had come, Rio was tipped over the edge, her attention long gone as she pulled forwards and ground down against Agatha’s needy mouth.</p><p>Agatha held her against her, trapping her so harshly that she couldn’t help but rock into her more but she was getting sensitive and had to scramble her hands to Agatha’s on her inner thighs to get her to relent.</p><p>She groaned as she did and reluctantly pulled away and swung her leg over to collapse onto her stomach beside Agatha.</p><p>She groaned quietly as she stretched her arms above her head and soon felt Agatha move up her body, kissing every inch of her thigh and biting down on her ass until she was making her way along her back and burying her nose into the hollow behind Rio’s ear, resting her body half on top of her.</p><p>“Come back,” she whispered quietly against her, “I want to do it again.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly and turned her head against the mattress to grin at Agatha who looked serious suddenly, her gaze sweeping across Rio’s face as she leant off to the side.</p><p>“I don’t have much time and-…”</p><p>Rio placed her fingers gently over Agatha’s lips, resting the pads there and smiling a little at the sight.</p><p>“You gotta give me a minute. And we should talk about this.”</p><p>She turned over fully then and found that before she could make the move to, Agatha had already pressed against her and wrapped her arm around her waist.</p><p>“I’ll have to leave soon,” Agatha said more gently this time and Rio nodded, coming down quicker from her high now as her smile faded away and her eyes swept over the majesty of Agatha’s face.</p><p>“I wish I could take a picture of you right now.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and moved her hand up to Rio’s cheek, watching her with a soft curiosity.</p><p>“Something to remember me by?”</p><p>Rio hummed a little, trying to pretend it didn’t hurt.</p><p>“I’ll never forget the way you look right now.”</p><p>“Don’t say things like that,” Agatha said, leaning in to brush their lips together.</p><p>“I can’t help it.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha whispered, kissing Rio a little more firmly this time.</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and closed her eyes, unable to look at the face she’d no longer get to see up this close anymore.</p><p>“You lied about Chicago. By the pool. In Italy. You lied.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s soft breaths against her lips, but didn’t say anything and it was Agatha who filled the silence.</p><p>“I saw you that night and I wanted you. More than I’d wanted anyone before. And I thought maybe if I got you alone… and then I saw you go to the bathroom and you were drunk and cute and you told me you’d buy me a ring and-…”</p><p>“A ring?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered open slowly and she frowned at Agatha, focusing briefly on her nose and seeing four tiny freckles in a vertical row along it, wondering if she’d ever be close enough to count them again.</p><p>“You told me you’d buy me a bigger ring than Ralph had. So I thought maybe you wouldn’t mind if I kissed you. And I asked and then… we were interrupted.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and was struck by the memory she’d never had because she’d been too liberal with the tequila in mourning a woman she’d never even had, before she would eventually be allowed her so fleetingly.</p><p>“You didn’t ever come back. You didn’t ever seek me out again. Even at awards shows.”</p><p>“I’m married. It was a lapse in judgment,” Agatha said in an even softer tone, but the words still stung all the same as Rio closed her eyes once more and fought the bile that rose in her throat.</p><p>“No tienes que estar casada, Agatha.” <em>You don’t have to be married, Agatha.</em></p><p>There was safety in saying the words in Spanish. They felt softer, a truth rather than a reminder.</p><p>But she didn’t open her eyes to see Agatha’s frown, her reluctance to speak even as her mouth opened to do so.</p><p>They were both silent for a while, Agatha’s breathing still soft against Rio’s lips, their noses occasionally nudging where Agatha must be pressing a little closer every few seconds.</p><p>“Y’know I’ve never come before.”</p><p>Rio blinked her eyes open and frowned across at Agatha, as if seeing her for the first time.</p><p>Agatha looked softer now, innocent even, even when she still had the evidence of Rio all over her face.</p><p>“I mean,” she began to clarify, “Not with another person.”</p><p>“I…” Rio started and then stopped herself, unsure how to even broach this topic without wanting to vomit. “Ralph doesn’t… he’s not good with his hands? His tongue? Does he have a tiny dick?”</p><p>Rio bet he did.</p><p>“No, I…” Agatha sighed and shook her head as she moved her fingers back to begin toying with Rio’s still damp hair.</p><p>“I mean he doesn’t use them. His fingers only to, y’know, push a little before he just…”</p><p>She trailed off and Rio pulled away, her incredulity taking over her rational mind for a second. And Agatha sat with her, watching her carefully as Rio stared off into the distance and tried to fathom a world where the person allowed to touch Agatha wouldn’t be spending every moment of their time together just worshipping her.</p><p>“He doesn’t even <em>try</em>?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat quietly, “I’m only telling you as, I don’t know, consider it a parting gift.”</p><p>Rio snapped her head around to Agatha then and stared at her without really seeing, “Do you think it makes me feel good that you’re in a loveless marriage with a guy who can’t make you come?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, and then dropped her gaze from Rio entirely, her expression suddenly tense, her brow furrowed and her lips briefly pursing.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio snapped sharply, unable to bear this new piece of information. Torn between horror and the dullest, smallest part of her that wanted to confirm Agatha’s assumption: that she was pleased that financier fucker didn’t make his wife come.</p><p>“You can’t spend-…”</p><p>She stopped herself, seeing Agatha’s eyes flash up to her own suddenly and knowing that she were about to push them down a dangerous route; a route where Rio would <em>ask</em> Agatha to leave Ralph and Agatha would say ‘no’.</p><p>So she moved slowly, giving Agatha the opportunity to stop her. But she didn’t. She instead reached her arms out to wrap around Rio’s waist as she straddled her and blinked up at her as Rio slipped her hand between them.</p><p>“Next time you’re with him,” she felt the bile rise in her throat once more, thick and threatening.</p><p>“I want you,” she pressed her thumb firmly over Agatha’s clit and made her moan softly.</p><p>“To tell him,” she twisted her hand and teased with her fingers, pushing two easily into Agatha.</p><p>“Exactly,” she curled her fingers inwards and started moving her thumb in slow circles.</p><p>“Where you like to be touched.” She kissed along Agatha’s jaw slowly until her lips were against her ear and she whispered:</p><p>“Close your eyes and it could be anyone.”</p><p>Agatha pulled back then, her hand moving to hold Rio’s wrist and Rio looked down at her in surprise as two things happened simultaneously:</p><p>Agatha said, “I don’t want it to be anyone.”</p><p>The front door opened.</p><p>Agatha’s hold on Rio’s wrist tightened and her soft expression transmogrified. It became panicked, stricken.</p><p>“I locked it,” she uttered breathlessly.</p><p>“Alice, she has keys,” Rio said urgently, already pulling away and hurrying to grab a discarded sweater and shorts from the chair in the corner of the room.</p><p>“Stay here,” she whispered as she pulled her shorts up her legs. “I’ll take her out back. Give me five minutes then leave. She won’t see you. You’ll be safe, I promise.”</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio glanced at the door and then looked to Agatha who was frozen to the spot, all colour drained from her previously flushed face.</p><p>Rio moved quickly to her and kissed her cheek before she ran to the bathroom to splash cold water on her face and then ran from the room, not daring to waste another second in glancing back at Agatha before she made her way to Alice.</p><p>Mercifully, her best friend was waiting for her in the kitchen.</p><p>“Did you just wake up?”</p><p>Rio scoffed, trying to subtly catch her breath as she moved past Alice without looking at her directly to grab a bottle of water from the fridge.</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes from behind her, “I want to talk to you about Agatha.”</p><p>“Uh huh,” Rio said absently, chugging down some water before simply striding past and out the double doors to try and steer Alice to the garden where she’d not be able to see an escaping Agatha.</p><p>Thankfully, she followed.</p><p>Rio could barely think straight as she took Alice to a bench beneath a tree in the very back of the small space and ran a hand through her hair as Alice sat beside her.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“Well,” Alice started slowly, shifting in her seat to face Rio properly, “You went from being best friends to nipping at each other to putting a bandaid on her to barely talking or looking at each other all night.”</p><p>Alice sighed quietly and then said, “Rio, did you try it on with her?”</p><p>And Rio couldn’t believe how close Alice was to the actual truth of it.</p><p>“No, no, I didn’t.”</p><p>Alice sighed again and turned back to stare at the pool that was barely a pool, especially compared to Agatha’s.</p><p>“She’s hot and she’s charismatic but-…”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio insisted, getting a little agitated that her best friend was warning her off the woman she’d just been riding.</p><p>“I get it. Agatha Harkness is off limits. Understood.”</p><p>Rio shot her friend a furtive glance and saw she was looking at her with a small smile, “Okay. Other than the initial thing with Ralph and Agatha being a little quiet it went well, though?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said much softer now, “It went well.”</p><p>Alice’s shoulders relaxed then and she ran a hand through her hair.</p><p>“I’ve said to Jen we can split the trips between. So I’m not missing out much time with you and her with Agatha.”</p><p>“That’s great.”</p><p>“Maybe it’ll just be the weekends, or any days off. The filming schedule keeps changing so I’m not sure when I’ll be heading down initially but I’ll always check in with you first, okay?”</p><p>“Okay. I know. I’ll be fine.”</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“You’re distracted. What’s-…?”</p><p>But then a noise made Alice look back to the house and she stood quickly, “What was that?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio said quickly, a sharp hit of panic flooding her veins, “probably just the wind.”</p><p>Alice remained standing and Rio thought she’d give up but she strode on through to the house and Rio hurried to catch up, knowing if she made too much of a fuss Alice would cotton on anyway.</p><p>“Alice, where are you going?”</p><p>“It sounded like the-…”</p><p>And Alice stopped as she hit the hallway, looking suspiciously at the front door and the keys that swayed slightly, suggesting it had just moved.</p><p>“It’s windy out. Santana, y’know. Does weird things,” Rio said as calmly as she could, grabbing Alice’s hand and tugging her back with her.</p><p>“I seriously think you need to reconsider security,” Alice was saying as Rio breathed out slowly and pulled Alice back round to the outside bench.</p><p>“I don’t need it.”</p><p>“You’re getting more famous. It’s time we considered it. Nutjobs everywhere.”</p><p>And so Rio managed to keep up appearances with Alice for another hour out on the bench, allowing her to go over their schedule for tomorrow and the plan once they landed.</p><p>She even managed to respond to every question, confirm she’d learnt at least half the script by heart, and was ready to start fresh on Monday morning.</p><p>By the time Alice left after making Rio promise she’d pack everything that night, Rio felt exhausted.</p><p>Physically from the morning’s activities and mentally from the strain of having Agatha for such a fleeting amount of time, having to release her, and having to help her hide.</p><p>She threw herself into her packing, deciding she couldn’t sleep in the soiled sheets and allowing only herself one indulgence of pressing her face into the pillow where Agatha had laid her head.</p><p>But she knew she had to move on. Get on. Get over.</p><p>It took until the late evening for the final straw in her bad afternoon and Rio found herself sat in a pile of folded clothes and two open suitcases crying over her lost favourite shirt.</p><p>She’d spent the last hour tearing the house apart trying to find it, certain that she’d recently washed it and put it away in the second drawer of her dresser.</p><p>But she couldn’t find it anywhere.</p><p>Unwilling to give up until she saw that the clock had struck 11pm and she would feel Alice’s wrath in the morning if she slept in or was less than chirpy on their early flight, she’d simply disintegrated where she sat, sobbing for a lost shirt with little cowboys with their flying lassos on it.</p><p>And Alice wouldn’t understand because she hated the shirt.</p><p>And Alice wouldn’t understand that it wasn’t just the shirt she was crying over.</p>

<p>It turns out that a good way to get over heartbreak is to be so busy that you can barely think.</p><p>A month went by and Rio had no time at all to think about Agatha.</p><p>To think about how they’d left it.</p><p>About how unhappy Agatha was in her marriage.</p><p>About how badly she wanted to see her, talk to her, touch her.</p><p>Setlife was the same as it always was. Rio was number one on the call sheet and so had to set a precedent which meant no flirting with extras, being earlier than anyone else to the set, knowing all of her lines and marks off by heart.</p><p>Which meant that her days off were mostly spent sleeping.</p><p>She was horizontal almost every hour she could be.</p><p>And not in any fun way.</p><p>In fact, she’d not slept with anyone since Agatha. And a month of no sex was longer than Rio had ever gone before. But even if she had the time or the energy she wouldn’t be interested.</p><p>Why settle when she’d had the best?</p><p>Even Alice was worried for her.</p><p>But Rio ignored the concerns of her best friend and focused on doing a good job, and on not worrying about a woman thousands of miles away with a husband.</p><p>Which was made ever so slightly easier because Rio hadn’t heard from Agatha since that last morning spent pressed together in her bedroom.</p><p>Any spare time she had she spent making sure to call her parents. Ever since she’d been embarrassed by the care package they’d sent to Alice she was now diligent about speaking to them every week.</p><p>And in all honesty, it made her feel better. It made her feel normal.</p><p>Only one night, about six weeks into the shoot, she’d plugged her headphones into her cell to make the call and she was chatting away about something a cousin of hers had done when her attention was stolen away by something else.</p><p>“…and I just said to your tía…”</p><p>Agatha had text her.</p><p>Rio had been so distracted by the name that appeared in the modal at the top of her screen as she’d idly being scrolling Instagram - and only vaguely listening to her mother - that she’d forgotten to read the message preview.</p><p>“…he’s just always been such a good boy, un ángel…”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly, only now vaguely aware that in her little house in Delaware Anna Vidal was happily chatting into her phone thinking her beloved child was paying attention.</p><p>She flicked out of Instagram and clicked into WhatsApp.</p><p>There on the Home Screen, right at the top of the list of her chats with coworkers or old friends, was Agatha’s name, the message and a little green ‘1’.</p><p>“…I have no idea how he gets away with it now…”</p><p>Rio clicked into it to expand it properly.</p><p>7:34pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I thought you’d be pleased to know that I’m taking Nicky to his first Celtics game next weekend.</p><p>Rio stared at it.</p><p>“… if you were doing anything like this dios mío…”</p><p>Agatha had reached out. Agatha was telling her her plans. Agatha was going to be much closer to Rio in just over a week.</p><p>And Rio had learnt her lesson now.</p><p>She’d first not text Agatha back for three days and regretted it.</p><p>Then she’d not text her back at all and regretted <em>that</em> even more.</p><p>“… anyway, your father was saying that he once knew…”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath as she sent her response, knowing it was risky, knowing that it could be potentially embarrassing.</p><p>7:35pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Can I come?</p><p>“…that niña encantadora…”</p><p>7:36pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I’ll buy you a ticket.</p><p>Rio’s heart leapt in her chest and she stared at her phone, unsure what had just happened and knowing only that next weekend she’d be seeing Agatha again.</p><p>And that Agatha wanted her there.</p><p>She <em>wanted</em> to see her.</p><p>“…mija?”</p><p>Rio was too busy staring down at Agatha’s last text that her mum had to repeat herself three times before she heard her.</p><p>“God, mom. Sorry. I’m so tired. Can I call you back tomorrow?”</p><p>There was a beat of silence and then Anna Vidal said in a softer tone, “Are you eating well? Do you need me to send anything?”</p><p>“No, mom. I love you. I’ll call tomorrow.”</p><p>“Okay, mija. I love you too.”</p><p>Rio hung up with a click of the button on the wire and went right back to staring at her phone screen.</p><p>She went through all the possible response she could think of and eventually settled on:</p><p>7:41pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: In exchange I’ll buy you a jersey.</p><p>7:42pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: What would John Smith say?</p><p>Rio grinned at her phone like she were fifteen and her crush were online.</p><p>Turns out six weeks thinking she was safe from Agatha’s gravitational pull were just a delusion.</p><p>She had her in her orbit.</p><p>She chewed on her lip and her thumbs danced over the keypad before she eventually tapped out:</p><p>7:44pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Hard to know what imaginary men might say. But the very real Agatha Harkness should thank me.</p><p>It was pushing things towards flirty perhaps, but not overstepping so much that Agatha couldn’t either shut it down or pull it right back.</p><p>7:45pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I’ve booked you a suite at The Langham. Is that thanks enough?</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe it. She wanted to reach through the phone to get to Agatha.</p><p>To pull her through it and have her here with her.</p><p>But she tempered her thoughts with the reminder that this wasn’t a private trip.</p><p>That anywhere Agatha went - particularly a big basketball game - she would be photographed.</p><p>And more than that, her seven year old son would be there.</p><p>Both things meant no subtle touches, no sly hand holds, no yearning looks.</p><p>And Rio could handle it because they’d agreed: they’d made a mistake, made it now properly, and it wouldn’t happen again.</p><p>But she was fucked now.</p><p>For the rest of the week all she’d be able to think about was the fact that she’d soon be back in the presence of Agatha. Soon be able to talk to her, to see if she missed her, to see if she still wanted her.</p><p>7:52pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I’ll let you know when I see you.</p><p>7:54pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Nicky’s excited already.</p><p>7:55pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Are you?</p><p>Rio put her phone down then. Ripped her headphones from her ears. Buried her face in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>She’d slipped up already.</p><p>She took long slow breaths and had to remind herself that she was talking to the woman who broke into her house, who touched her leg whilst sitting just feet away from her husband, who cheated with her not once, but twice.</p><p>It would be insane for Agatha to have bought her a ticket and a hotel suite and to <em>not</em> be excited.</p><p>But the question felt exposing anyway.</p><p>It felt incredibly vulnerable to ask.</p><p>She waited until she could catch her breath again before she checked her phone.</p><p>8:01pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I don’t care for basketball.</p><p>Rio had to roll her eyes, had to huff a little at the response. Because surely Agatha knew what she’d been asking.</p><p>With Agatha’s refusal to play ball she pushed a little, because she couldn’t help it now, deciding that she could no longer run anymore. She couldn’t just lay down and let Agatha fuck her physically and emotionally.</p><p>8:03pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I’m excited to see you.</p><p>Rio didn’t receive a text back after that. Not for five minutes. Not for ten. Not for twenty or even an hour.</p><p>She’d moved on, she had to. She’d gone to cleanse her face and get ready for bed.</p><p>She’d pulled her script out of her bag and was settling down for the night to force the lines into her Agatha-centric brain when the next text came through.</p><p>9:17pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: We’ll see you Saturday at the hotel. Reception will have my room under John Smith. I’ll let them know you’re coming so you can come find us. Have a good week. X</p><p>Rio read and reread the message.</p><p>She read it so many times she memorised it like it were one of her lines that she was yet to even partially commit to memory.</p><p>She read it in her own voice, in Agatha’s voice, in the voice she hoped Agatha would use when she said it.</p><p>She felt the whispered words on her temple, on her cheek, on her lips, she felt it against her breast, over her ribs, between her thighs.</p><p>She didn’t respond to it. Not out of habit but out of necessity. She couldn’t respond to something that she didn’t know how to.</p><p>Perhaps a ‘thank you’ or a ‘cool see you then’ would work or perhaps a ‘great I’ll be thinking about it every second until I’m with you again’.</p><p>She put her phone down on the side and returned to her script.</p><p>The words were ephemera to her. The meaning behind them lost on her as she tried to focus in.</p><p>By 11pm she gave up. Deciding a quick run through in the makeup chair with Alice would be the best bet.</p><p>Sleep eluded her too.</p><p>But by morning, as tired as she was, she felt a little more sane.</p><p>Agatha didn’t have to agree to her coming. Hell, Agatha didn’t even have to tell her they were going. Agatha could have gone with Ralph, could not have gone at all.</p><p>And yet she was taking her son, the one she said she had because of Rio, the one she said <em>looked</em> like Rio, to see Rio’s favourite team play. And she’d told Rio about it.</p><p>Made the arrangements so Rio could join them.</p><p>Perhaps have dinner with them.</p><p>It’d be like a field trip into family life. A life with Agatha.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said sharply, snapping her fingers in front of Rio’s face - an annoying habit she’d picked up from time spent with Jen - “snap out of it. You need to nail these lines.”</p><p>Rio sighed from her position in her makeup chair, earning her a gentle squeeze on the shoulder from the woman currently adjusting the curl of her front layers.</p><p>She glanced up and shared a soft smile with her before she focused back in on the script.</p><p>She had just over two hours before she was due to shoot her first scene. Which was usually more than enough time to get lines into her brain.</p><p>“Amply sufficient,” her dad would have called it.</p><p>By some miracle, the time taken was enough for her.</p><p>She managed to squeeze the lines into her full brain and by the time she was on her mark she was Rio Vidal the actress again, not Rio Vidal the lovelorn.</p><p>The day went smoothly after that, with the only interruptions being from Alice telling her about some interview she had lined up later that evening over the phone.</p><p>And soon Agatha was pushed to the back of Rio’s mind, protected under lock and key so Rio could focus on being a person again.</p><p>Someone who took charge of the set and its culture with a gentle hand and genuine enthusiasm for what they were doing.</p><p>With the weekend approaching Rio decided not to tell Alice what she was doing or where she was going. Alice was flying off to see Jen on the Friday night anyway so Rio felt no real desire to stress her out by letting her know her plans.</p><p>So she arrived in Boston with zero fanfare, a Celtics cap on her head, a light button down hiding the Celtics branded T-shirt she wore and a heavy oversized blazer that only just protected her from the chill of the October temperatures.</p><p>She was recognised by the flight attendant on the way over and the woman sitting beside her on the plane.</p><p>Both were polite. Both left her alone after whispered mentions of their being fans.</p><p>By the time Rio got to the hotel she was in a good mood, practically vibrating with the prospect of seeing Agatha, and excited even to see the littlest boy with the biggest smile.</p><p>She checked in, and found that the staff knew to expect her and so told her before she even had to ask where Agatha was.</p><p>Or John Smith, as she’d labelled herself.</p><p>The concierge took Rio to her floor, showed her to her suite, and pointed out that Agatha’s was just down the corridor from her.</p><p>Tipping the concierge generously before she was left alone, she went to drop her bag by her bed and straighten herself out in the bathroom.</p><p>She applied more lipstick, ruffled her hair slightly, and liberally sprayed more perfume on herself.</p><p>It was pointless to pretend she didn’t want to look good for Agatha.</p><p>Once satisfied that she looked good enough she went to sort her bags, finding in her suitcase the plastic bag branded with a Sports Store logo, containing the gifts she’d bought for Agatha and Nicky.</p><p>With her bag and her courage raised, she left her suite to go and knock on the door of Agatha’ suite.</p><p>The door opened not ten seconds after Rio had knocked and for the first time in over a month Rio found herself face to face with Agatha.</p><p>She looked just breathtaking. Casual. Happy.</p><p>“You came.”</p><p>“You thought I wouldn’t?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows slightly and wondered why Agatha always suspected she wouldn’t show up when she said she would.</p><p>But she had no time at all to dwell on it as gentle hands found her hips and she felt a kiss against her cheek.</p><p>“I hope you’re prepared for a <em>very</em> excited little boy.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and felt a strange kind of calm as Agatha pulled her into the room, her hand now curled around her blazer still as she shut the door behind her.</p><p>This Agatha was different to the one she’d left behind in her bedroom. She seemed relaxed and more at peace and Rio wondered if it was because she was away with Nicky or being in a new city, or maybe, just maybe she hoped it might be because Rio had asked to come along.</p><p>“I told you I was excited too.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly and Rio had to resist the urge to kiss her as her hand slipped away and the sounds of another person entering the room came into Rio’s conscious.</p><p>Agatha turned and Rio looked over to see Nicky sporting her jersey and smiling where he had a chocolate bar in his hand and evidence that he’d been enjoying it smeared across his mouth.</p><p>Rio laughed at the sight and Agatha muttered, “Don’t encourage him.”</p><p>“Hey, kid,” Rio said, ignoring Agatha’s comments as she moved around to Nicky and held up her bag of goodies.</p><p>“You got some chocolate, riiiiiiight,” she raised her hand to point it out and smiled widely, “there.”</p><p>Nicky wiped at it hurriedly but Rio didn’t seem much concerned about it so neither was he. His eyes were on the bag anyway.</p><p>“So, in honour of your first game, I wanted to make sure you had the right fit.”</p><p>“Okay,” Nicky said quietly, his serious expression returning as he stared at Rio.</p><p>Agatha moved over behind them and perched on the edge of the table beside where Rio had now crouched down to be more level with Nicky.</p><p>She rifled through the bag for a few seconds before she pulled out a cap that matched the one she had attached to her small cross body bag.</p><p>“Here,” she placed it carefully on Nicky’s head and smiled at the sight of it.</p><p>“Goes perfectly with your jersey.”</p><p>Nicky looked up to see the underside of the cap’s lip and Rio shot Agatha a quick glance to see she was smiling at her, and Rio felt weak for it.</p><p>But Nicky had already moved forwards to hug Rio, clumsily smashing his cap into her shoulder and just about holding his chocolate bar away so it didn’t smush into her white shirt beneath her blazer.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Rio said softly, to the silent thank you, squeezing the little boy gently before releasing him and watching with a laugh as he turned to his mother and proudly held his head high with his new cap.</p><p>“Gorgeous!” Agatha proclaimed with a grin, playfully grasping the lip of the cap and shaking it to make Nicky laugh.</p><p>Rio watched the two of them for a second until she reached back into the bag and produced the next gift.</p><p>“But wait, we need to make sure your mom doesn’t embarrass us.”</p><p>She held up a brand new Celtics jersey and beamed at Agatha who looked suddenly less than thrilled and rolled her eyes.</p><p>“I don’t need to wear it.”</p><p>“You do, mama!”</p><p>Rio laughed and turned it over with a wink, “It has your name and everything.”</p><p>This seemed to soften Agatha’s resolve a little but she still eyed it suspiciously, “Why four?”</p><p>Rio shrugged and cleared her throat, standing suddenly so that she could shake off the question and hold out the jersey to Agatha.</p><p>“You have to wear it.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes up at Rio but took it and held it up for herself, and Rio just knew she was playing the part of a reluctant fan when really she’d soon give in and would wear the jersey - if not for Rio, at least for Nicky.</p><p>“Mama,” Nicky said suddenly and both women looked down to the little boy who was motioning to Rio with an unsubtle movement of his head.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but stood swiftly and bundled the light fabric of her gift in one hand, using the other to snake around Rio’s waist and pull her in for a hug just as her son had just done, only this time it wasn’t as clumsy.</p><p>“Thank you,” she murmured so close to Rio’s ear that Rio had to fight for her life not to shiver at it in front of Agatha’s little boy.</p><p>She returned the hug loosely, fearful she’d cling on.</p><p>But Agatha was already pulling away and her hand fell back down to the fabric of Rio’s blazer to hold her in place as she turned to Nicky.</p><p>“Go wash your face and we’ll leave soon, okay?”</p><p>Nicky nodded and scampered off only to have Agatha call after him: “No running!”</p><p>Rio laughed until Agatha turned back to her and she softened suddenly, her smile still present but tempered by the expression on Agatha’s face.</p><p>“I am not wearing this.”</p><p>“Why not? You don’t want to upset your precious Lakers?”</p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened a little on Rio’s blazer and Rio’s smile began to grow again.</p><p>“I don’t wear sports jerseys.”</p><p>“Think it’ll damage your brand?”</p><p>“No, I-…”</p><p>“Because if you ask me, attending a game with your son and another actress with just as much chance of winning the Oscar as you but <em>not</em> joining in will look <em>much</em> worse.”</p><p>“Just as much chance?”</p><p>“You know it.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes and her gaze dropped briefly to Rio’s grin before she pulled away and released her hold on her blazer.</p><p>“Fine. Fine.”</p><p>And Rio almost choked on nothing as Agatha pulled her shirt over her head and stood just in a lacy black bra.</p><p>She took her time unfurling the jersey and Rio used that time to stare at her breasts, remembering how they felt in her hands, in her mouth, pressed up against her.</p><p>“You’re staring,” Agatha pointed out, as if she weren’t going painfully slow to <em>make sure</em> Rio would.</p><p>But she was tragically covered again, only Rio couldn’t help but think she somehow looked <em>better</em> this way. The loose jersey showed off Agatha’s toned arms and Rio stared at the way it hung.</p><p>She’d never much thought about the look of a jersey before, about the way it could sit on a beautiful woman.</p><p>But suddenly she found herself practically salivating and she knew she was staring but she couldn’t help it.</p><p>And then hands were on her arms and Agatha had stepped closer, “Something on your mind?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed, her fingers twitching at her sides, desperate to reach out and touch but unwilling to give herself an inch for fear she’d take a mile.</p><p>“No. No. Just excited for the game.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away just as Nicky appeared in the room again, looking significantly less messy than he had before.</p><p>Brushing off her inappropriate lust for a married mother of one, Rio unattached her own cap from her bag and placed it on her head, receiving a shy grin from Nicky as she did so.</p><p>“Twins,” Agatha announced with a wry smile in Rio’s direction that she rolled her eyes at.</p><p>“Let’s go, it’s good to get there early so-…”</p><p>But she’d stepped towards the door and Agatha held her arm out to stop her, “I should maybe have explained first.”</p><p>Something like fear settled in Rio’s stomach and she stared with raised brows at Agatha, watching as the woman before her glanced at Nicky and then looked back to her.</p><p>“I’ve hired security,” she lowered her voice a little and Rio looked around to see Nicky now slipping his cap off to admire it as he waited by the couch.</p><p>“Just one guy and a driver. I took Nicky to a show on broadway last year and it got pretty intense.”</p><p>Rio turned slowly to look back at Agatha and nodded, understanding that whilst she were famous to some, Agatha was famous to all. And the chances of fans being subtle about seeing her out with her son were next to zero.</p><p>“Okay,” she said softly, “that’s fine.”</p><p>She frowned a little when Agatha continued to watch her and it took a second for her to clock why she was still being watched.</p><p>She glanced at Nicky to make sure he wasn’t paying attention and stepped closer, leaning in until she could feel the warmth of Agatha’s cheek just millimetres from her own. “I’ll keep it friendly. No one will see anything that-…”</p><p>“I’m not worried about that,” Agatha said quietly, turning her head a little to catch Rio’s gaze again. “I know you will. I just want to make sure you’re prepared.”</p><p>Rio frowned but nodded slowly, feeling a sense of foreboding at the way Agatha was looking at her but unsure how else she could calm her concerns.</p><p>Only Agatha was moving away again to pick up her jacket and Rio felt her excitement transform into nerves. She wouldn’t think twice about going to a game usually. Sure, there’d be paps. There’d be people trying to get her attention, get selfies, get her to send a video to their friend, but nothing she’d ever consider dangerous.</p><p>But where Rio was known, Agatha was infamous.</p><p>And Nicky, well he was just a little boy.</p><p>Rio followed the little family out of the suite, stood beside them in the elevator, answered all of Nicky’s shy questions about the team, about the best players, about the snacks his mom said he could have with as much enthusiasm as she could muster when she was thinking about what they’d be facing when they exited the hotel.</p><p>They arrived in the lobby to zero fanfare but a tall man in dark clothing approached and nodded once at Rio and Agatha and Rio felt her shoulders fall in relief.</p><p>No one would be getting past this wall of a man.</p><p>Still, she kept close to the other two as they moved through the open space. But through the revolving doors she saw a little of what Agatha had tried to warn her of.</p><p>“You’re kidding,” she uttered softly, but Agatha caught it and glanced at her, her hand tight in Nicky’s.</p><p>“I told you.”</p><p>“How do they know you’re here? They weren’t here earlier.”</p><p>“They’ll know I’m going to the game. It’s staff, usually. Anyone with eyes to see me arrive, who saw Nicky’s jersey.”</p><p>Rio scowled and swallowed down her disgust that someone would scurry to the press to tell them that a lone woman and her young son were easy pickings for press photos.</p><p>“Nicky,” she said quickly, as they were approaching the doors, “can you hold my hand?”</p><p>The boy was frowning and Rio saw that Agatha had turned to look as he took Rio’s hand and she held his left in her left, falling into step behind them so she could guard them from behind.</p><p>Agatha shot her what she thought was a grateful smile but Rio could return it, feeling her blood boil at the audacity of these men primed and ready and already snapping photos of them through the glass.</p><p>Two concierges and the hired security moved forwards first to battle out a route to the waiting SUV and Rio moved her free hand to Nicky’s shoulder to trap him safely between herself and Agatha.</p><p>“Keep your head down, Nicky. Your mom and I will be right here.”</p><p>She straightened from where she’d bent to whisper to the boy and moved when the other two did, striding forwards with her head down and her eyes on Nicky as Agatha’s name was shouted from all angles.</p><p>She heard her own too.</p><p>But she heard Nicky’s as well and she wanted to punch the throat of whichever man felt it appropriate to try and get the attention of the scared little boy behind his mother.</p><p>The barrage lasted no more than ten seconds, with the security and hotel staff able to keep the worst of it at bay and direct Agatha, Nicky, and Rio into the back of the truck.</p><p>Rio caught her breath as she watched Agatha check on her son, her blue eyes wide and full of concern as she brushed her thumbs over the boy’s cheeks and watched him until he settled against her and she tucked him under her arm.</p><p>Rio had to look away, her whole body vibrating with fury that a simple trip to a game couldn’t be normal for Agatha and her son and she found herself flinching when a gentle hand touched her arm.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look over and clenched her jaw as she stared out of the window, relieved they were driving now, that she’d have five minutes to calm down before she’d have to face it again.</p><p>“Honey.”</p><p>Rio looked then, surprised Agatha had called her that with her son present and unable to ignore for a second time the softness in Agatha’s voice.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded stiffly and caught Agatha’s gaze drop to her tight jaw.</p><p>She looked away again and turned to look out the window once more, feeling Agatha squeeze her arm before pulling away.</p><p>The three of them remained silent for the short journey, the only noises the soft movement of Nicky as he toyed idly with his mother’s buttons on her jacket.</p><p>Rio hadn’t looked back at Agatha or Nicky since Agatha had checked on her but when they pulled up to the stadium she was relieved to see that there was no hoards of paparazzi waiting for them, only crowds of fans and attendants milling around trying to direct everyone to the right entrance.</p><p>Rio turned back around then, and caught Agatha’s eye, she froze for a second, seeing Agatha so concerned and so soft with Nicky still against her that she forgot how angry she was and suddenly remembered how smitten she was instead.</p><p>But the door was being opened and Agatha turned away to step out and help Nicky.</p><p>Rio slipped out behind them and looked around when her hand was taken by the little boy and he grinned up at her. She’d forgotten in the stress of earlier how excited he was. And far be it for her to ruin his special day by being in a bad mood about some idiots with cameras.</p><p>They made it through the crowds with the security hanging back a little to give them some space.</p><p>But Rio was more aware than usual of the faces and fingers that pointed in their direction. She could feel eyes on them, could see phones being raised and knew by the time they reached the turnstiles to enter, they’d been captured on various devices at least a thousand times.</p><p>The brick wall of a man who’d protected them earlier waited outside the stadium to collect them later and Rio could only hope he’d be right there as soon as they needed him when they left.</p><p>They were taken straight to their court side seats by an attendant and Rio felt the rush of being back in one of her favourite places in all the world.</p><p>The smell of the rubber, the hot dogs and the popcorn, god she could bathe in it.</p><p>Which reminded her, as Nicky began swinging his legs on the seat and Agatha shrugged her jacket off to reveal the ridiculously attractive way she wore her jersey: “Snacks? Who wants what? I’m getting a beer and nachos.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced a little but Nicky looked up and bounced a little in his seat, “Nachos!”</p><p>“And beer too?”</p><p>“No! Soda please.”</p><p>“Okay, coming right up. And for her ladyship?”</p><p>Rio looked up and grinned at Agatha who was now lounging back in her seat, looking surprisingly at home where she sat in amongst the crowds at TD Gardens.</p><p>She heard her name called as she stood up and she glanced up at the stands behind them to see a couple women waving frantically at her.</p><p>She smiled and turned back to Agatha, “So?”</p><p>She caught Agatha on the turn and arched a brow slightly, seeing Agatha work through something in her mind.</p><p>“Will you take Nicky? Show him the delights of a stadium snack hall?”</p><p>Nicky was already jumping from his seat and Rio had no choice but to accept the hand held out to her and she watched curiously as Agatha glanced back at the women now shouting again, calling Rio’s name over and over.</p><p>She wanted so desperately to say something, to ask if she were being sent away with Agatha’s child to ensure she didn’t return with a girl on her arm, but there was no way she could do it without either Nicky hearing or the whole stadium getting a shot of Rio Vidal whispering suggestively into Agatha Harkness’s ear.</p><p>She merely smiled and tugged Nicky in the direction of the food hall, pulling him in front of her when the crowds got a little close and guiding him by his shoulders.</p><p>A few people looked her way but most were polite enough to move swiftly on when they saw she had a child with her.</p><p>And Rio focused most of her attention on Nicky, making sure he was close and safe and that he saw all of the varieties of foods that would set his pulse racing and make his stomach churn if he had too much.</p><p>Just as they were waiting on their order - Rio, with the help of Nicky, had chosen a hotdog and a beer for Agatha - she felt a tap on her shoulder.</p><p>“Excuse me, are you Rio Vidal?”</p><p>“I am, yes.”</p><p>“Like the actress?”</p><p>The woman’s voice was so loud that even through the crowds Rio could feel people starting to turn. She felt Nicky turn his head where she still had a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Can I get a picture? I’m such a fan!”</p><p>Rio smiled and bit her lip briefly, “I usually would but I’m with my friend here so maybe another time.”</p><p>“Oh please?” The lady looked down to Nicky and raised her brows before looking back to Rio who’d turned to check on him too. “He looks so like you. He’s not…?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said quickly, suddenly panicked that the assumption from a stranger that Nicky was her child would confuse the boy.</p><p>“A friend’s son.”</p><p>“Well are you sure on the quick selfie?”</p><p>“Yes, only if I do it for you I’ll have to-…”</p><p>“Rio Vidal?”</p><p>Rio glanced instinctively over her shoulder and felt Nicky turn that way too, her hold tightening on him as she spotted a man through the crowds pointing at her.</p><p>“Seriously, it’ll take a second.”</p><p>And as she turned back to the woman she flinched at the raised phone and the sight of herself on the little screen, Nicky’s cap just visible in the bottom corner.</p><p>“Please don’t do that,” Rio said sternly, holding her hand up, “I’m just trying to get snacks and get out of here.”</p><p>The woman grumbled something about Rio being ungrateful but Rio had already ducked down to speak directly to Nicky, “You okay? We won’t be much longer.”</p><p>“Mm’fine,” Nicky said quietly but he looked serious again where before he’d been wide-eyed and happy.</p><p>So Rio stood back up and pulled him closer, crossing one arm over him as she fished her phone out of her pocket and dialled for Agatha.</p><p>“Hey,” she said quickly as Agatha answered after one ring.</p><p>“No se asusten. ¿Podrían enviar a un empleado? Estamos cerca del puesto de comida, el número seis. Todo está bien.” <em>Don’t panic. Can you send an attendant to us? We’re at the food stand. Number six. Everything’s fine.</em></p><p>Rio heard her name rippling through the crowd and she wondered why she felt so exposed now, so vulnerable to it when usually she’d barely register it at all.</p><p>But then Nicky was holding her arm that sat across his chest and she realised with a pang that it was him who’d changed the way she felt.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Te prometo que estará a salvo conmigo.” <em>He’s safe with me, I promise.</em></p><p>There was a muffled noise on the end of the line as Rio moved two steps forwards with Nicky as the queue moved.</p><p>“Someone’s coming,” Agatha said and Rio could hear the panic in her voice and it broke her heart as that coupled with Nicky’s firm grip on her arm made her sick with emotions she didn’t have the desire to name.</p><p>“He’s fine, Agatha. I’m just being cautious,” she said in soft English, now more worried about reassuring Agatha than being overheard.</p><p>“Can you stay on until they’re with you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Are you getting mobbed?”</p><p>“Something like that.”</p><p>There was silence for a while as nothing much happened. But Rio began to relax a little and she hoped Agatha were too.</p><p>“Any pretty girls?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and bit her lip, glancing to the side to check that though people were looking they weren’t close enough to overhear her.</p><p>“Some.”</p><p>Rio felt Nicky toying with the fabric of her shirt and she glanced down at him, unable to see his face because of the angle. She gave him a gentle squeeze and he rocked his head back to look up at Rio and Rio grinned down at him matching his goofy smile.</p><p>“He’s quite the helper when it comes to-…”</p><p>“<em>Don’t</em> even say it.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly and turned when she felt a tap on the shoulder and a man in a Celtics bib was smiling at her.</p><p>“They’re here,” she said into the phone.</p><p>“Hurry back.”</p><p>Rio hung up and placed her phone in her pocket as she spoke to the attendant in a low tone, her hold never relenting on Nicky, even as the attendant moved them away to a separate area and stayed close as he spoke to his colleagues through a radio.</p><p>Rio felt a little embarrassed that she’d been given special treatment but she couldn’t risk Nicky being hounded or photographed or scared so she turned her attention back to him and bent around to whisper to him, “Beer’s coming up!”</p><p>Nicky laughed just as Rio felt another tap on her shoulder and she straightened again, her grin fading at the sight of the two women from the stands before grinning at her.</p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>“Hey! We couldn’t find you for ages but we just <em>had</em> to say hi.”</p><p>“Hi,” Rio repeated, feeling Nicky toy with her shirt again. She cleared her throat and looked across the way to see if their food and drinks had arrived yet.</p><p>The attendant was still close by.</p><p>“We were wondering,” one of them started as the other clocked Nicky and made to lift his cap.</p><p>“Woah,” Rio said quickly, pushing her hand away as she pulled him back.</p><p>“Everything okay, Miss Vidal?”</p><p>Rio glanced at the attendant and then frowned back at the women, her other arm now crossing over Nicky too.</p><p>“Fine. Don’t touch my kid.”</p><p>The woman who’d done it just blinked and at least had the decency to flush at Rio’s sudden change in demeanour, apparently recognising that she’d overstepped.</p><p>Rio turned then, once sure no one would be trying to get to Nicky again, and asked the attendant if he wouldn’t mind bringing the food and drinks down to them and then gently guided Nicky back through the crowds and out to the stadium.</p><p>Only when at the top of the tunnel to get to their seats did Rio breathe again and she released Nicky’s hand to let him run to his mum and dive at her.</p><p>Even from afar she could see that Agatha looked relieved to have him back with her and Rio knew she couldn’t look as stressed as she felt so Agatha wouldn’t panic more so she schooled her face into a smile and took her seat back up.</p><p>“They’re bringing it out. We got you a hot dog.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, too busy kissing a wriggling Nicky on the cheek over and over to respond to the prospect of a stadium-cooked hotdog.</p><p>Rio turned away from the sight and lifted her cap off her head to shake her hair out, running her fingers through it as she watched the stadium slowly fill around them.</p><p>It took Agatha reaching over to nudge her arm for her to turn back.</p><p>“Are you going to be loud?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and laughed, “You cannot be questioning if <em>I</em> will be loud when-…”</p><p>But Agatha was smirking and Rio narrowed her eyes at her, aware suddenly that she’d been trying to pull her from her own thoughts.</p><p>“Yes. I like to cheer my team on.”</p><p>Agatha hummed as she surveyed Rio, “Well my team aren’t here so I won’t be cheering.”</p><p>“Your team is your son’s team and Nicky has chosen the best team in the world haven’t you, kid?”</p><p>She turned to Nicky who grinned and raised his hand to match Rio’s offered high five.</p><p>Agatha scoffed and Rio winked at her over Nicky’s head, replacing her cap back on her head again and grinning once more.</p><p>“Can I take a picture?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows but nodded, turning herself more in her seat so Agatha could get a good angle.</p><p>“No, of the two of you.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head and watched Agatha for a second, moving automatically when Nicky turned around in his seat too to place a hand on his arm.</p><p>“By the pitch,” Agatha instructed as if it were the most casual thing in the world and she motioned for them both to go.</p><p>“Court,” Rio corrected with a genuinely soft smile as Agatha rolled her eyes. But she stood all the same and held her hand out to Nicky to pull him with her. She stood with him just on the edge of the court, holding his shoulders as she bent down to grin at the camera with him, both in their matching caps.</p><p>Agatha took a few snaps and laughed when Rio flipped both their caps to sit backwards on their heads and Nicky giggled as the picture was taken.</p><p>And Rio couldn’t help but beam up at Agatha, watching her as she checked the pictures she’d taken and moving to look over her shoulder at them. Her perfume filled her lungs and she had to step back, feeling dizzy with it suddenly.</p><p>A voice behind her saved her from her sudden turn and she looked to see the guy who’d come to rescue them standing with a large tray with their food and drink.</p><p>“Oh god, thank you.” She moved quickly forwards and helped him put it all down.</p><p>“Want me to take a picture of the three of you? I’ll get good angles, I promise.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“I’d love that,” Agatha said from where she was now beside Rio suddenly, “thank you.”</p><p>Rio felt her hand on her upper back as she leant over to pass her phone over and she turned to catch Agatha’s eye but she’d already looked away.</p><p>“Caps forwards? Caps back?” She asked with an attempt to pretend her stomach wasn’t doing flips at the prospect of being photographed with Agatha and Nicky. On Agatha’s phone. In front of thousands of people.</p><p>“Either,” Agatha said with a smirk, “both.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but suddenly became aware of her limbs as she approached Agatha’s side.</p><p>Nicky had fallen easily into place in front of his mum and Agatha’s hands were on his shoulders so Rio had to squash in.</p><p>“Feeling shy?” Agatha asked softly, raising a brow but continuing to smile as Rio hesitated. “Put your arm around me.”</p><p>But Rio’s limbs felt heavy and strangely long and she didn’t quite know how to move them until Agatha was reaching for her hand and lifting it, transferring it to her shoulder furthest from Rio so she moved closer so the stretch wasn’t so strange.</p><p>“Better,” Agatha muttered softly and Rio cleared her throat before she finally relaxed into it, curling her fingers properly around Agatha’s shoulder and turning to smile for the camera.</p><p>She was aware behind their photographer that a lot of the crowd were snapping shots too and she whispered, “Jen will be furious.”</p><p>“So let her be.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and watched in surprise as Agatha turned to smile at her, raising her chin slightly in challenge. “What?”</p><p>“Nothing. Just… missing something.”</p><p>“And what might-…?”</p><p>But Rio had transferred her cap to Agatha’s head and was grinning at the sight.</p><p>“Perfect.”</p><p>She ruffled her own hair to make sure it was sitting okay and turned sharply to smile for the camera again, squeezing Agatha’s shoulder as she did.</p><p>“Idiot,” Agatha muttered quietly but Rio noted that she didn’t take the cap off.</p><p>“One with the two of them,” Rio said after a few more seconds of posing. She stole her cap back and replaced it on her head and strode away, turning to admire the view instead of the most beautiful woman in the stadium and her son.</p><p>Agatha looked up at her and Rio took in a sharp intake of breath because she was radiant. She was glowing. She was…</p><p><em>Shit.</em></p><p>She was in love.</p><p>Rio swallowed down the truth as if she’d been told to swallow a golf ball and saw that Agatha was now looking at her curiously, was adjusting herself with Nicky to lead him back and was approaching her.</p><p>But Rio looked away, turned to duck down and grab her beer so she had something to do, something to focus on when Agatha touched her arm but said nothing and made no enquiry into her sudden change in demeanour.</p><p>She’d been in the precipice of it for so long that she hadn’t even noticed that she’d tipped over.</p><p>That she’d fallen head first and hadn’t even noticed until she was swimming in her love for Agatha, drowning in it, and swallowing it down like the cool beer in her hand.</p><p>She’d downed half of it before she knew what she’d done.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio looked over and saw Nicky pointing at the tunnel, and looked up to see the cheerleaders begin to stream out.</p><p>Rio raised her brows and glanced Agatha’s way, watching as she took a sip of her beer and almost managed to hide her grimace but Rio didn’t know if it was the beer or the young women now running out to the centre of the court that had caused it.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t look at Agatha any longer because she finally had an answer as to why it all hurt so much. Why she’d given in so easily.</p><p>But the lights were swirling, the music was picking up, and Nicky beside her was transfixed on the dancers, his large coke resting in his lap, almost the same size as him. And Rio decided to focus on him rather than the tempest of emotions storming through her.</p><p>“You think you could dance like that?”</p><p>“No. Mama dances.”</p><p>“Oh does she?”</p><p>Rio looked up to see Agatha glance her way and raise her brows, “What?”</p><p>“You dance like that? Nicky says you do.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and playfully tugged Nicky’s cap down to cover his eyes. He squealed and giggled and Agatha relented with a grin before she focused back in on Rio again.</p><p>“I think you know that isn’t true.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio said with a smirk, “You have rhythm.”</p><p>Whether real or imaginary, Agatha blushed a little and Rio grinned at the sight of it, thrilled then that Agatha’s eyes dropped to it and she felt a little more of that hope that still stoked flames in her stomach.</p><p>But Agatha narrowed her gaze a little and Rio had to look away for fear she’d stare all night and turned instead to the dancers, choosing to focus in on them instead of the tragedy of the family beside her that she may be able to occasionally intrude on but would never be her own.</p><p>But the cheerleaders spot Rio and Agatha too and the little boy between them swinging his legs to the music and after the routine and the stadium applause, they all took their turns running around the perimeter and one stopped right in front of Rio.</p><p>“Rio, baby!”</p><p>And Rio recognised this woman when she was close up and she swallowed thickly, forcing her smile, “Hey!”</p><p>She stood quickly and gave the cheerleader a quick, one-armed hug.</p><p>“Who’s this little guy?” The woman pulled half back, their arms still around each other as Rio swung to look where she was pointing and saw Nicky look suddenly shy again.</p><p>“This is Nicky. He’s new to the Celtics family.”</p><p>Her gaze flicked across to Agatha and she saw that blue eyes were focused on Rio’s hand curled around the bare waist of the cheerleader whose name Rio did <em>not</em> remember.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha said quickly, placing a reassuring hand on Nicky’s back before the cheerleader could address him.</p><p>“Rio, why don’t you introduce us?”</p><p><em>Bitch.</em> Rio thought suddenly, wondering briefly if she had a tell for not knowing someone’s name and how she could get Agatha to tell her what it was.</p><p>“Of course,” she said quickly, unable to think of anything else to say and simply offering her free hand to refer to Nicky and Agatha in turn.</p><p>Suddenly she was aware of the crowd around them, of the people taking photos and videos and she wondered if she would come out well from this or if she’d tank her career because of a brief dalliance with a cheerleader two years ago and her love for the woman in front of her.</p><p>“This is Nicky. And this is Agatha.”</p><p><em>God, fuck me. Kill me. Now.</em></p><p>Agatha was looking at Rio now, her brows raised, her jaw tight.</p><p>And Rio felt two things at once: how cruel it was that Agatha was doing this to her and how good it felt that she was doing this to her.</p><p>Because it meant she was jealous. Surely it meant she was jealous.<br/>
Nicky, shy as he was, held his hand out and Rio forgot her torment for a second and smiled down at him.</p><p>“Please to meet you, little one. I’m Danielle.”</p><p><em>Thank fuck,</em> Rio thought.</p><p>Nicky shook the woman’s hand and Rio moved away from her, withdrawing her arm from around her waist and turning to her properly.</p><p>“Think you could get us in with the players?”</p><p>“Babe, I’m barely allowed to be here for as long as I’ve been.”</p><p>And the lights moved and changed and Phil Collins began blasting signally the team’s imminent arrival so Rio and Danielle looked around them before their eyes met again.</p><p>“Leave it with me.”</p><p>Rio grinned genuinely at the woman and settled back down in her seat, her excitement overwhelming her previous concerns as she turned to Nicky to shake his shoulder but she saw Agatha’s hand already curled around it and her expression tense but purposefully softened for the lens she knew would be on them.</p><p>“She’s pretty.”</p><p>Rio’s brows raised from Nicky to Agatha and she tilted her head a little, her tongue poking in the side of her cheek.</p><p>“Old friend,” she said enigmatically and caught the flash in Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>The crowd roared into life around them and even the promise of her precious Celtics couldn’t tear her away from blue eyes.</p><p>But Nicky was on his feet and almost spilling his soda and so Rio had to shift her focus to the little boy as Agatha did too. And silently, without acknowledgement, they put everything aside to focus on making sure Agatha’s son had the best time of his life.</p><p>Rio took it upon herself to become the pseudo commentator for the little boy, making sure he knew who everyone was, what the plays were, why things were fouls and why other things were not fouls (“biased ref, hates the C’s”).</p><p>And Agatha spent half the time watching Nicky too, holding the back of his oversized jersey when he stood on his seat for a better view, and otherwise shooting glances at Rio as she dedicated her time teaching and entertaining her son.</p><p>By the time half-time was called Rio was exhausted from imparting her knowledge and screaming at the court.</p><p>Nicky was high as a kite on the excitement of the thing and due to the excess soda he’d consumed.</p><p>And Agatha was, and looked, more relaxed than she had in a long while.</p><p>Even as the boards began to light up and cameras headed their way she didn’t seem concerned or fussed at all as the spotlight first fell to her.</p><p>And Rio looked up at the jumbotron with a grin, beaming at the sight of Agatha’s smiling face on it. The crowds went wild for her. And she could see why.</p><p>Agatha Harkness sporting their team’s jersey was a win even if you weren’t a huge fan.</p><p>But the camera moved and suddenly Rio was on the board. She was a known fan. A known frequenter of games. So this was perhaps less exciting for everyone but she still received a huge cheer from the crowd as she waved and gestured for them to get louder for her.</p><p>And they sure did.</p><p>Nicky was giggling by her side and when the camera was away again Rio turned to stick her tongue out at him before she looked across at Agatha and raised her brows, “Oh Jen’s gonna be maaaaad.”</p><p>“Screw Jen.”</p><p>Rio laughed and reached down for her now warm beer, and finished it in one go, relaxing back in her seat as she luxuriated in the day out and vacation from her recent working life where she’d barely had time to think, let alone enjoy.</p><p>And then there was the happy kid bouncing to the music beside her and the woman beyond him, pulling him in to cuddle him into her side and ask him questions about the game.</p><p>Rio looked around at them and felt herself yearn once more.</p><p>The way Agatha was softer for Nicky, the way she sometimes was with Rio.</p><p>The way her hands brushed the soft hair sitting along his upper back, the hands that had done that to Rio, the hands that had held her own and caressed her cheek.</p><p>Agatha looked up then, her chin rested on Nicky’s head as he settled against her and she smiled curiously across at Rio, watching her watch them for a while before she shouted above the noise.</p><p>“Are you having fun?”</p><p>“Like you wouldn’t believe.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and then turned her head to kiss the top of Nicky’s and the game started again.</p><p>Rio resumed her new favourite role of Nicky’s personal entertainer and lifted him from his seat when the final whistle blew and their team won.</p><p>Nicky tried his best to give Rio tinnitus by screaming loudly by her ear but Rio didn’t mind because she too was bellowing her pleasure at the court.</p><p>Agatha didn’t shout but at least stood and clapped and soon moved closer to place her hands on both of their backs.</p><p>“Did you win?”</p><p>“Shut up!” Rio laughed, placing Nicky back on his feet again so she wouldn’t lose her hearing and her ability to stand straight for the next week.</p><p>“You know we did.”</p><p>Nicky was beaming so much that Rio worried he might actually break his face and then she saw it. He put his tongue between his teeth and giggled as Agatha took him into her arms and something triggered in her brain that she hadn’t noticed before.</p><p>They did look similar.</p><p>Her face fell slightly as she stared at him and Agatha caught it, and tugged at her shirt, making her eyes dart over.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Nicky was looking around and he turned serious again, frowning where Rio must look stricken.</p><p>“Nothing, nothing.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and tried to shake it off. Maybe it was a trick of the light. Maybe it was an overspill from her desire to be with Agatha.</p><p>Of her love for Agatha.</p><p>Regardless, it didn’t mean anything.</p><p>“We should wait a little,” Agatha was saying quietly, “just so the crowds are a little less. That security guard will be there when we get out the stadium but best just wait.”</p><p>Rio only nodded and lifted her cap to shake out her hair, and her attention was caught as she did as the cheerleader from before ran over and straight into her arms.</p><p>Releasing a soft noise when their bodies collided, Rio cleared her throat quietly.</p><p>“I had a word. Do you want to come back? You can wait in the tunnel when the guys come out the locker room.”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio babbled, unaware her hand was being held and blue eyes were down on it.</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>“Nicky?” Rio turned to Agatha and Nicky and saw the little boy hiding half against his mum now, blinking up at the cheerleader shyly.</p><p>“Want to come meet the team?”</p><p>“No thank you.”</p><p>“No?” Rio asked with a frown and dropped down to crouch before him, tweaking his cap up a little so she could see his face better, “Are you sure?”</p><p>Agatha bent down too, turning Nicky so the three now sat in a triangle, all the same level, all facing each other, Rio and Agatha knocking knees.</p><p>“Yes, mama.”</p><p>“Okay, honey. Why don’t we go back to the hotel and order some chicken nuggets instead?”</p><p>Nicky smiled at this and nodded furiously which made Rio’s concerns fade quickly but Agatha had taken her knee just as she’d made to stand again.</p><p>“You can stay with your friend if you want.”</p><p>“No,” Rio frowned, “no. I’ll come with you.”</p><p>Agatha only nodded and dropped her hold on Rio’s knee as they both straightened and Rio turned to break the news to Danielle.</p><p>“Maybe another time?”</p><p>“You have my number. Maybe use it sometime?”</p><p>Rio received a kiss on the cheek and the woman was gone, leaving only the three of them now by the edge of the court and Agatha avoiding her eye.</p><p>“A friend,” she repeated with raised brows even as she looked anywhere but at Rio.</p><p>“Yes. A pretty one.”</p><p>Agatha looked around then and Rio smiled a little at the intensity of her expression but didn’t push it.</p><p>Soon enough the attendant was back with them and as the stragglers left the stadium, so did they. Rio hung back a little to keep an eye on Agatha and Nicky from behind, intent on making sure there were no surprise fan interactions that would ruin the rest of their day.</p><p>They moved through the whispered sounds of their names and the unsubtle pictures being taken without much hassle and when they finally cracked the outer shell of the stadium and hit the cool outside air they were guided back to the waiting car with security in tow - which made Rio feel a hell of a lot better.</p><p>Nicky slid in first this time with Agatha in the middle and Rio bringing up the rear.</p><p>She felt the press of Agatha’s thigh against hers before she’d even properly settled in her seat and in the pretext of putting on her seatbelt she brushed her hand over the small of Agatha’s back, enjoying for a second the secret proximity to the woman she’d hopelessly fallen for.</p><p>By the time they were bundled back into Agatha’s suite, Rio was exhausted with the energy of the day.</p><p>She was left to lounge whilst Nicky went find something in his room and Agatha went to see he was fine before she came back out and sat by Rio’s hip on the couch.</p><p>“You’re so good with him.”</p><p>“He’s easy to be around.”</p><p>“What happened in line for food?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“You wouldn’t have-…”</p><p>Rio sighed and sat slowly, now sitting level with Agatha on the couch and reaching to hold her wrist gently, as if that would help calm her.</p><p>“If I hadn’t had Nicky with me it would have been fine, and it was. I… I just wanted someone there. Just in case. I didn’t want him to freak out.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw was working, flexing and unflexing with every clench of her teeth but her eyes were still soft and she nodded slowly, dropping her gaze to where Rio held her wrist.</p><p>“He’s shy.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“You did the right thing. I shouldn’t have sent him with you in the first place.”</p><p>“Why did you?”</p><p>But Rio knew why. Agatha had thought with Nicky there Rio wouldn’t flirt. Would be too distracted. And she was right, obviously. But she didn’t know that Rio wasn’t interested in flirting with anyone anymore.</p><p>Anyone that wasn’t Agatha, anyway.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t respond and instead squeezed Rio’s hand gently before she stood from the couch.</p><p>“I’ll order food.”</p><p>Rio watched her go and then watched Nicky arrive back in the room holding up a mini basketball.</p><p>“Can we play?”</p><p>Rio laughed and glanced at Agatha who had pursed her lips in response, clearly not keen on the idea of her son and Rio smashed expensive vases in an expensive suite.</p><p>“Not tonight, buddy. But next time, okay? We gotta get you good enough to be captain of the Celtics!”</p><p>The little boy only nodded and jumped up on the couch beside her, throwing the ball up in the air to catch and soon they’d devised a game whereby they sat at opposite ends and gently tossed the ball back and forth.</p><p>Which Agatha only allowed because they’d get to fumble it and even when Nicky’s aim was off Rio could reach out to catch it before it drifted off to cause any permanent damage.</p><p>They evening went by happily, with Nicky entertained by Rio’s post-match analysis and thoughts on how she’d have done things differently and scored at least ten more points.</p><p>And Agatha contributed only to ask questions that would make Nicky laugh and Rio roll her eyes.</p><p>They feasted on nuggets and pizza and Nicky even got a special bowl of chocolate ice cream delivered and soon enough they lounged all on the same couch, with Agatha’s arm casually draped over Rio’s thigh and a tired little boy tucked into her side, unaware of his mother’s hold on the woman the other side of her.</p><p>The whole time Rio felt like she was flying.</p><p>She had Agatha back.</p><p>Nicky liked her.</p><p>Nicky wanted to talk to her or keep her talking.</p><p>And Agatha was smiling or laughing or rolling her eyes.</p><p>It was a facsimile of a family again. And Rio wanted it to last forever.</p><p>But Nicky had to be taken to bed and the illusion dissolved as the reality of being alone with Agatha meant she had to be brave, be bold, be as clear as she could be about how she felt about her.</p><p>Nicky gave her a quick hug and then Agatha whispered, “I’ll be right back.”</p><p>And she was alone, waiting for the woman she loved to come back to her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio sat in the familiar position on Agatha Harkness’s couch, albeit in an unfamiliar hotel suite, waiting on Agatha to return to her from putting Nicky to bed.</p><p>Unlike before she knew what was to happen when she came back to her because she was going to take control.</p><p>She had to.</p><p>She was going to come clean, to tell Agatha that it was more than the crush Alice had told her about, it was more than incredible sex and a lust so undeniable she felt like she was on fire whenever Agatha touched her.</p><p>She’d never been the first to say it, never been the first to feel it, but now, now she’d gone and fallen for the most famous woman in the world who just happened to be married, who just so happened to want her too. Maybe just not <em>love</em> her.</p><p>And maybe Agatha would pull away again, she thought, or maybe it would go how she hoped.</p><p>Agatha would tell her she was divorcing Ralph, that she was going to run away with her, that they could buy a cottage somewhere in the woods and live a happy and easy life just the three of them.</p><p>Just as Rio were imagining a forest-themed basketball court, Agatha appeared again.</p><p>“Hey, he okay?”</p><p>“Fast asleep,” Agatha said with a small smile, eyeing the dishes Rio had piled up on the side.</p><p>“You’re a good house guest.”</p><p>“I try.”</p><p>“Wine?”</p><p>Rio nodded with a smile and reached to hold her glass for Agatha when she came to pour the rest of the wine they’d started earlier.</p><p>The bottle was finished by the time Agatha filled her own glass and Rio pulled her legs beneath her as they leant to cheers.</p><p>“To an incredible win today.”</p><p>“To you making Nicky’s day.”</p><p>Rio paused before she drank and began to second guess herself once more. If Agatha did pull away then she’d take Nicky with her too and as much as she barely knew the kid she’d grown fond of him.</p><p>Or maybe everything Agatha had told her about the reason for his existence, the fact even she could now see they looked alike, his shitty dad, it was all making Rio feel protective of him.</p><p>Rio drank down more than a mouthful of the wine and noticed Agatha watching her carefully. But she’d turned away, glancing briefly in the direction of Nicky’s door, just taking a second to breathe.</p><p>She felt a shift beside her and a hand on her cheek and Agatha was turning her head to kiss her.</p><p>And Rio could have cried for it, could have suffered a thousand humiliations to just feel the way she currently felt with Agatha leaning into her, holding her in place so their lips could be together for the first time in over a month.</p><p>But it lasted barely five seconds and Agatha was talking again, her thumb tracing the familiar sweep over her cheek.</p><p>“It’s been too long.”</p><p>Rio reacted only by lifting her hand to curl around the thin fabric at the neck of Agatha’s new jersey and she swallowed before she whispered, “We need to talk.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away then and broke Rio’s hold on her as she put at least two feet of distance between them, her blue eyes over on the bar.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said softly, frowning at the reaction, unable to reach back out for fear she’d be rejected again.</p><p>“More wine?”</p><p>Agatha asked suddenly, pushing herself up from the sofa and grabbing her glass to march to the bar at the end of the room.</p><p>Rio watched silently, her traitorous heart thrumming in her chest as her eyes scanned over Agatha as she sourced a bottle from the fridge and proceeded to open it with an expert flourish.</p><p>“You never did tell me why the four.”</p><p>Rio blinked, her mind so cloudly she couldn’t determine the question.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha turned over her shoulder as she tugged the cork from the bottle with a soft <em>pop</em>. “My shirt.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped to the large ‘4’ displayed on Agatha’s front and she felt herself blush for it.</p><p>“It’s just a number.”</p><p>“Then why react this way every time I ask.”</p><p>Rio bit down on the inside of her cheek, knowing Agatha well enough now to know she wouldn’t drop it.</p><p>“It was a random number, or was supposed to be. I knew the player’s wouldn’t mean anything to you so I was just trying to come up with a number and,” she shrugged and watched as Agatha slowly walked back to where she sat on the couch, stopping just before her with a bottle in one hand and her glass in the other, “you have four little freckles on your nose. Tiny ones. I only noticed them the last time we-… anyway they’re in a vertical line and they’re… whatever… four.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t react for a second and Rio feared she might laugh but she maintained eye contact and refused to look away. If she backed down now, she’d never get through the night.</p><p>The woman before her slowly came back to life, stepping past her and sitting down beside her.</p><p>“Drink your wine,” she said in a soft voice, her gaze elsewhere as she lifted her own glass to drink down the remnants of the wine there.</p><p>Rio did as she was told and winced slightly at the volume of the liquid that poured down her throat.</p><p>But Agatha was soon filling her glass back up with the new wine and their eyes met again. She looked softer again, far more at ease than she had been when Rio had suggested they talk.</p><p>And Rio had to look away for fear if Agatha kissed her again she’d forget about talking altogether.</p><p>“Have things,” Rio started slowly, knowing she needed to get to the point quickly or she’d get drunk or too nervous and wouldn’t be able to get to what she knew she needed to bring up, “with Ralph, have they been… any better?”</p><p>“Ralph’s fine,” Agatha said curtly.</p><p>Rio turned to look at Agatha then and saw her focus in on her wine, saw the flex in her jaw.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha glanced over and Rio almost lost her nerve entirely.</p><p>“Have you had sex with him since we were together?”</p><p>Agatha turned away again and took down another gulp of wine. Rio held her glass in her lap, one hand curled around the cup, the other toying with the stem.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only breathe a silent sigh of relief that nobody had touched Agatha since she last had. Least of all Ralph.</p><p>The man who didn’t deserve her but had her all the same.</p><p>“Have you?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, watched Agatha eye her for a while and then turn away again.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p><em>No one compares. I’ve barely had the energy to think because I’ve spent the last month learning lines and thinking about you. I just want you. All the time.</em></p><p>“Agatha,” Rio started softly, shifting where she sat to lean forwards a little but something sparked in the woman opposite and Agatha looked panicked suddenly, fearful.</p><p>“Don’t,” she said quickly, “don’t say something sweet. Not again.”</p><p>Rio frowned and reached out, knowing her fingers would be cool from where she’d held her wine glass, and they curled around Agatha’s warm bicep and Agatha mercifully didn't pull away.</p><p>“Then don’t ask me why.”</p><p>Rio moved her thumb slowly across warm skin, watching Agatha’s profile tense and then release again, the pattern repeating over and over until Rio couldn’t take it anymore and she eventually spoke:</p><p>“Will you leave Ralph?”</p><p>“You can’t ask me that.”</p><p>“I deserve to know.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her arm away then and took a quick sip of wine, “Why’s that?”</p><p>“Because we’ve been having an affair.”</p><p>“We slept together twice. That’s all.”</p><p>And Rio blinked, moved back an inch like she’d been physically pushed away.</p><p>“It’s more than that.”</p><p>“Is it?”</p><p>“You know it is.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and ran a hand through her hair, and turned her body away slightly, raising her arm to the back of the sofa to rest her elbow there.</p><p>“I’m married, Rio.”</p><p>“And you don’t have to be.”</p><p>Agatha just shook her head and turned away fully, her gaze on the dark night sky out the window.</p><p>Rio swallowed down her dignity and placed her glass on the side as she moved to sit just an inch from Agatha, her hand slowly reaching to turn her head to her.</p><p>“Don’t push me away.”</p><p>“You’ve got what you wanted. I don’t need to push.”</p><p>Rio frowned at the woman before her, the woman who was now freezing her out, let alone pushing her.</p><p>But she’d backed off before when Agatha’s intention had been the opposite and so she had to try. Just once more. Just one more difficult conversation.</p><p>And then she’d back away if Agatha didn’t open up.</p><p>If she didn’t soften even slightly to her.</p><p>“I want you. I thought I’d made that clear.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything and so Rio ducked her head to try and catch her gaze again, and she felt Agatha’s hand move to her lap and she exhaled slowly, wondering if this was a sign of her softening.</p><p>Lithe fingers curled, two of them looping into the belt loop at the front of her jeans.</p><p>She was tangling them together, loosely, barely, but she was holding her.</p><p>So Rio persevered.</p><p>“You should leave him.”</p><p>The words floated between them, carried forth like a prayer to an apathetic god with the power to grant wishes but no desire to wield it.</p><p>“You don’t understand.”</p><p>Rio shifted and dropped her hold from Agatha’s cheek to curl around the side of her neck, her fingers settling in the soft hair at the back of her head.</p><p>She took a breath, made more confident by the fingers that were still curled in her belt loop but fearful because Agatha hadn’t looked up at her yet.</p><p>“No, I don’t. You don’t love him. You don’t even <em>like</em> him. You have money and means and-…”</p><p>“It’s more complicated than that.”</p><p>“And you have someone waiting for you on the other side.”</p><p>Agatha took a breath and she looked up, her expression changing from frustration to confusion and back again.</p><p>“Don’t,” she said quietly. “You can’t keep saying things like that.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed out, “I mean it. If you wanted me I’d be here.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyelids flickered and Rio thought she was going to look away but she kept her gaze steady on Rio’s face, her irises now whirlpools as Rio moved her free hand down to rest against Agatha’s in her lap.</p><p>“Don’t make promises you can’t keep.”</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>“You’re too young. You’re-…”</p><p>Rio captured whatever the next excuse was going to be in a soft kiss to the corner of Agatha’s mouth. She felt Agatha tighten her hold on her pants and she shifted closer to press their lips together properly.</p><p>Just as she moved to deepen the kiss, to feed the beast within her that had been craving Agatha for the past six weeks she felt a tear brush her nose and she frowned as she broke the contact suddenly.</p><p>Agatha gasped at the suddenness of Rio moving away and turned from her, releasing her hold.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered gently, feeling her own eyes begin to sting with the promise of tears.</p><p>But Agatha was moving away, placing her wine down and standing in one swift movement.</p><p>“I need to check on Nicky.”</p><p>Rio could only watch as she left, could only feel the crushing realisation that even pushing Agatha wasn’t going to work. And when she heard the door close softly to Nicky’s bedroom she moved to knock back the remainder of her wine, staring down at the coffee table as she contemplated what to do next.</p><p>Losing Agatha entirely was inconceivable.</p><p>Being made to go through the next few months able to see her but not be with her was too horrifying to contemplate.</p><p>Agatha was gone for more than five minutes and Rio was beginning to believe that she’d simply locked herself away with Nicky so Rio couldn’t get to her.</p><p>But she arrived back in the room when Rio was already halfway through her next glass of wine and sat cradling it with her knees pulled close to her chest.</p><p>“He’ll try and take him,” Agatha said from across the room, her voice barely above a whisper as if she feared voicing her fears would bring them to life.</p><p>“What we have works. What we’ve built works. I’m as happy as I ever thought I’d get to be. I have Nicky. I… I told you that first night. My work and Nicky is all I need.”</p><p>And Rio felt like someone had dropped a house on her heart. Like somehow it had shattered inside her body and was floating around in the hollow of her chest, so sharp and visceral was the pain of it.</p><p>“You’re happy with me too,” Rio said after a few seconds of getting used to this new feeling of utter devastation.</p><p>She raised her gaze slowly to meet Agatha’s and watched her twist the hem of her jersey in her fingers, watched her flex her jaw and drop her gaze to Rio’s calves.</p><p>And Rio knew it was true. Knew that the smiles hadn’t been false. That the soft touches and the way Agatha reached for her when no one was looking couldn’t have been fake.</p><p>“I can’t lose him.”</p><p>“Ralph wouldn’t take him from you.”</p><p>“Ralph,” Agatha started and then clenched her jaw and Rio saw in her eyes that same distant look she’d seen before, that same cloudiness that sometimes came over Agatha and made Rio want to reach in and pull her back.</p><p>“Ralph should have married some sweet girl who wanted to stay home and cook for him. Instead he married me and he won’t let me humiliate him.”</p><p>Rio sat forwards then, planting her feet firmly on the floor and her elbows on her knees.</p><p>“Then why did he marry you?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped and Rio watched as she held her empty left ring finger in her right hand, her eyes still that same distant way.</p><p>“Our mothers are friends. It was a set up. One neither of us had much choice in. And then my career took off and he had to move to LA with me and I got pregnant and we became the dream couple.”</p><p>She trailed off with a venom in her tone, a sarcastic spiteful lilt to the last two words.</p><p>A marriage of convenience. A forced one. Rio felt white hot fury flash through her, adding to the sharp pain still present in her chest.</p><p>It was needless then. Agatha’s misery was needless.</p><p>She clenched her fists over her knees and forced herself to calm down, but the idea of Agatha being shackled to a man because of a choice her mother had made was intolerable.</p><p>Inconceivable.</p><p>Irredeemable.</p><p>She took a deep breath and dropped her head, closing her eyes for a second before she trusted herself to speak again.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said tentatively, “No judge would ever look at you and Nicky and want to tear you apart.”</p><p>“I’m the parent who travels more. I’m the parent who-…”</p><p>“You’re the parent who <em>loves</em> Nicky. Ralph barely looked at him when I saw them together.”</p><p>“He’ll try and take him. Even if it were joint custody… even if I couldn’t see my son for-…”</p><p>But Agatha stopped talking and Rio looked back up with wide eyes and saw that the woman before her was wiping away tears.</p><p>She stood without thinking and strode over without hesitance and pulled Agatha into a tight hug that the older woman melted into, pressing her face into the crook of Rio’s neck.</p><p>And the fact that Agatha held her just as tightly meant that the shards of her shattered heart softened slightly. The hollowness faded somewhat and she filled herself instead with the promise that Agatha was hers again, if only briefly, if only for the amount of time she was allowed to hold her.</p><p>The soft breathing against her neck began to even out and Rio felt Agatha’s lips brush her tentatively before she pulled away and pressed their foreheads together.</p><p>Agatha smelt like her perfume, the wine she’d been drinking, and something that Rio couldn’t name but that reminded her of home.</p><p>“Will you stay tonight? Just to be here. Just one last time?”</p><p>Rio nodded gently and leant in to press their lips together, some of the pain returning at Agatha’s suggestion that this would be it, that they’d never get to do this again or be this close.</p><p>“Agatha,” she murmured quietly, frowning a little at the sight of the freckles across Agatha’s nose she’d only had the fortune to spot once and now she’d never get to see them again.</p><p>“If you change your mind about Ralph, if you ever do, I’ll wait for you.”</p><p>Rio gasped quietly where Agatha’s hold tightened all of a sudden and she raised her head a little, her heart hammering so hard in her chest that she thought she’d go deaf because of it.</p><p>But Agatha was gazing at her with those blue eyes that swirled with tears again and Rio knew she was looking for the lie, looking for hesitance in Rio that would never show because Rio was sure now. She knew what she wanted and she had to make Agatha see it. She had to let Agatha know.</p><p>She took a breath.</p><p>“I’m in l-…”</p><p>“Don’t, Rio.” Agatha said urgently, her hold still impossibly tight around Rio’s waist as tears began to fall and her face crumpled before her. “Don’t say it. Don’t. Please don’t.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond to tell Agatha she had to because she had to know but Agatha was crying properly now and Rio could only shake her head and then pull Agatha back against her neck, gasping softly at the physical feel of her tears against her, at the possessive hold of her waist and the lips that moved soundlessly against her skin, breathing silent words and delivering damp promises.</p><p>Rio’s own body began to give in, whether from lack of oxygen as she took in short, shallow breaths, or the way Agatha was breaking down in her arms, she buried her face in Agatha’s hair and cried for what could have been, what should have been, and what never was.</p><p>Agatha pulled away only when her tears had dried and her breath was hitching just every thirty seconds instead of every ten.</p><p>She blindly nudged her face into Rio’s, directing her to turn and when she did so she found her lips and poured the silent despair into a kiss.</p><p>Rio whimpered softly, her own tears still running where Agatha’s had dried.</p><p>It felt like a goodbye. Like all hope was gone because Agatha was opening up to the pain of it properly for the first time.</p><p>And she wasn’t offering an alternative.</p><p>“I can’t breathe, Agatha,” she gasped quietly when Agatha squeezed her more and she pulled back a little.</p><p>Agatha relented and took Rio’s hand, stepping away and silently pulling Rio through to her bedroom where she tugged her into the middle of the bed with her.</p><p>Rio was hiccuping softly now, the heel of her free hand rubbing harshly against her eyes to try and stem the flow of tears but it didn’t help. It just made them sting more.</p><p>But she’d take physical pain any day over the torment of her jagged, shattered heart.</p><p>Agatha released her once sure she wasn’t going to leave the bed and she shuffled to undo her own pants, throwing them from the bed when they were removed.</p><p>She’d recovered faster than Rio had and Rio still felt shaky, still felt weak. So Agatha took charge and lay her back. She removed her jeans easily and threw them away too before she pulled the duvet up and over them, trapping them both beneath it and laying cautiously on top of Rio, their legs now tangled and their tear-dampened chests pressed together.</p><p>It hurt more to have Agatha like this, to have her gazing down at her like she was precious, like she couldn’t bear to let her go or let her leave, but she’d said it was the last time and so Rio didn’t protest, didn’t try to protect herself or her heart.</p><p>Her arms simply wrapped around Agatha and held her down against her because pain was better than absence.</p><p>“You deserve so much more,” Agatha whispered once Rio’s arms were snug around her and the another of her soft hiccups had died in her throat.</p><p>Rio shook her head and frowned deeply, “I deserve you. I want you.”</p><p>“I can’t be what you want me to be.”</p><p>“I want you to be mine. But I want you to be,” a soft hiccup interrupted her and a soft twitch at the side of Agatha’s lips told Rio that she was softening for her once more, if only slightly, only a hiccup’s worth.</p><p>“I want you to be happy. And know that you don’t need to stay in a marriage because you think it’s easier or because you’re afraid.”</p><p>Agatha ducked her head slowly then and kissed the corner of Rio’s mouth. “I’m not afraid of Ralph. Just what he could do to Nicky.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach lurched as Agatha brushed their noses and she hiccuped again, her diaphragm unable to settle yet when her mind and body were working overtime to not breakdown again.</p><p>“That boy will always be yours. He is not his father’s son.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her again and Rio frowned up at her when she pulled back a little, the hand that had been resting on the pillow now moving to sweep dark hair from her forehead.</p><p>“Does Ralph love you?”</p><p>Agatha’s forefinger trailed down the curve of her cheek until it hit Rio’s chin and she held it there a while before answering.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Does he love Nicky?”</p><p>“Not the way he should.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, searching in blue eyes for what Agatha was thinking, how she was feeling, but unable to find her again.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio began tentatively, her hold tightening around the woman above her who was now focused on her fingers as they made the same journey from Rio’s forehead down to her jaw again.</p><p>Agatha was distracting herself, avoiding her gaze, she knew that much. But she kept her hold on her tight even as she hiccuped softly again before finishing what she’d started: “Has anyone ever told you they love you before?”</p><p>Like a moth to a flame Agatha’s eyes darted back up to Rio’s and Rio knew she’d guessed right immediately. She knew she’d been right to assume that Agatha was testing her still, that she still didn’t believe Rio because she’d never had reassurance from anyone else.</p><p>Not in this way. Not in any true way that mattered.</p><p>Agatha moved her head just an inch but it was enough confirmation and Rio didn’t push it for both their sakes.</p><p>She felt dizzy with the idea that Agatha was loved the world over, adored in every corner, praised so often that her name was legendary, but that no one had made Agatha feel as loved as she deserved to.</p><p>But Agatha was rolling off of her, slipping into her side and Rio rolled with her, already missing the weight of her body on top of her.</p><p>Only she didn’t pull away, she simply pressed closer and this time wrapped her arms around Rio again, keeping their legs tangled until her hand eventually slipped down to rub along Rio’s thigh and she lifted it to loop over her hips.</p><p>“I meant what I said,” another soft hiccup and a twitch of Agatha’s lips in response, “I’ll wait for you.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha squeeze her over her knee and then brush back up to her thigh, finding the fabric of her underwear at her hip and twisting it in her fingers. It didn’t feel like a request, it felt instead like something to hold onto and so Rio remained still, watching Agatha with a steady gaze even as she hiccuped again.</p><p>“I don’t want you to.”</p><p>“Then tell me not to.”</p><p>Agatha closed her mouth and dropped her gaze to Rio’s lips and remained still, the only movement under the hot duvet that guarded them from the outside world now the soft brushes of Agatha’s thumb along the soft skin at the top of Rio’s thigh.</p><p>Rio hiccuped softly again and this time Agatha’s lips didn’t reacted. She simply remained silent and gazed at Rio’s parted lips, lost in her own mind again.</p><p>And through the silence, piece by piece, Rio’s heart began to slowly mend itself.</p><p>“When you’re ready,” Rio whispered tentatively, watching as Agatha kept her gaze down, “I want to tell you what I was trying to earlier.”</p><p>Rio moved her hand up to caress Agatha’s cheek and she closed her eyes, turning into Rio’s touch.</p><p>Rio moved then to kiss her and felt her kiss back, somehow more sure in it than she’d been all night, somehow more demanding of her.</p><p>The hand twisted in her underwear tightened its hold and pulled to press their hips together, fitting as flush as two puzzle pieces.</p><p>Rio’s body betrayed her and she hiccuped against Agatha’s lips and felt her smile properly against them, felt her adjust them so Agatha was pushing her onto her back again and she was settling between Rio’s legs that had parted to let her.</p><p>She kissed her once, twice, three times before she pulled away and cupped her cheek.</p><p>“You’ll need to sneak out early.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and dropped her gaze to Rio’s lips again, brushing them over with the pad of her thumb.</p><p>“When’s your flight tomorrow?”</p><p>“Early. I have press in the afternoon.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said quietly, a soft frown forming on her face even as Rio now tugged her jersey up to seek the warmth of her skin beneath.</p><p>“You really haven’t slept with anyone else?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“They’re not you.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said quietly, dragging her hand down slowly to rest across her throat, “Don’t-…”</p><p>“Say things like that, I know.”</p><p>Rio hiccuped softly and Agatha’s gaze darted back up as her thumb rested in the hollow of her throat, her fingers still curled gently around it.</p><p>“We can’t… not tonight.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because I want to be loud and free with it and I can’t be.”</p><p>“We can go soft and slow.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond except to drag her hand down between them, brushing over Rio’s breast until she could twist it and slide it into her underwear.</p><p>Rio whimpered and adjusted a little beneath her to reach down and mimic her movements, finding  Agatha as needy as ever when they’d barely touched.</p><p>“Tell me before you’re about to come, okay?” Rio whispered as she stirred her hips slightly with the movement of Agatha’s now familiar touches.</p><p>“I want to make it last longer.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond and only moaned a little with the first brush of her clit and she buried her face into Rio’s neck to dampen her noises.</p><p>Rio’s free arm wrapped around Agatha to hold her there, burying her fingers in dark hair and she found tears forming in her eyes as Agatha buried her fingers inside of her for the first time in weeks.</p><p>She had missed this, missed the way her body responded and ached for Agatha whenever she was touching her. The way she clenched around her when she was inside of her. The way her body squirmed and writhed with barely any reason to simply because Agatha was close.</p><p>But she focused on what she was doing, focused on the breathing against her neck that was picking up and the rocking of Agatha’s hips into her hand with every thrust.</p><p>She was close already, and she slowed down, making Agatha whine quietly, her own thrusts increasing in strength and vigour so that Rio arched up and into her, feeling Agatha’s mouth open against her neck and her tongue trace a thick line along it.</p><p>She groaned and rocked until with one expert twist of Agatha’s hand she came below her, biting down on her own lip to not make as much noise as she wanted to.</p><p>But Agatha was vibrating above her, rocking desperately against Rio’s hand where she’d halted her movements.</p><p>Seconds after Rio came Agatha pulled up and removed her hand from her underwear to place her fingers into Rio’s panting mouth, letting her suck herself off of them as Agatha continued to rock against her.</p><p>“Rio. Rio. Fuck me. Harder. Properly. Baby. Now.”</p><p>Rio lost all sense of her plans to build Agatha up and instead with her tongue swirling around her fingers she pressed more firmly into the woman bucking greedily above her and bullied her clit until Agatha arched her back and came with a silent scream above her.</p><p>The sight was otherworldly.</p><p>She looked magnificent.</p><p>And Rio was so in love with her.</p><p>Agatha collapsed back down against her and pulled her fingers from Rio’s mouth to instead encircle her arms around her, sliding them up and under her shoulders so Rio had to pull out and simply hold Agatha against her.</p><p>A soft moan fell to her ear as Rio scratched her back gently beneath her jersey and Rio smiled at the feel of the vibration against her chest.</p><p>“I was going to build you up.”</p><p>“Don’t care,” Agatha mumbled quietly, pressing her nose to Rio’s ear. “Don’t need it.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly and closed her eyes, turning her head slowly to breathe Agatha in.</p><p>Agatha soon pulled back to look down at Rio properly and she smiled lazily at the sight of Rio’s dark eyes.</p><p>“How much longer do you have with filming?”</p><p>“It’ll take me up to Christmas.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and her smile faded slowly, “Okay.”</p><p>“Can I see you again?”</p><p>“I need some time, Rio.”</p><p>Rio could only nod because she feared she’d release a sob if she opened her mouth. And Agatha seemed to know this too so she leant in and pressed a gentle kiss to pouting lips and whispered against them, “You should sleep.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered shut as Agatha brushed her lips across her cheek, to her nose, and up to her forehead where she kissed her again.</p><p>“You too.”</p><p>They stayed like that until Agatha rolled off again and pressed herself into Rio’s side.</p><p>They were both still for a while, with Rio drawing lazy patterns along Agatha’s arm as it lay wrapped around her waist but soon Agatha was pulling her over again, making her lay flush against her and pulling her leg up over her hip once more.</p><p>“Go to sleep,” she whispered quietly, brushing their lips in a barely there kiss.</p><p>“I’ll wake you in the morning.”</p><p>Rio hummed softly, and made sure to kiss Agatha properly before she settled down again, their noses just a breath away as the gentle feel of Agatha’s hand caressing her thigh helped her to drift off.</p><p>Rio woke in the same position she’d fallen asleep in, only the duvet had been pulled down to allow them to breathe properly and Agatha was now pressing soft kisses to her face, “Rio, honey. I’m sorry. You need to wake up.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, the daze between sleeping and waking making her forget that her heart had been pulverised and glued back together the night before.</p><p>And all she felt was Agatha against her, her hand still warm and firm against her thigh, her lips still soft and gentle against her skin.</p><p>“Baby,” she whispered again, “you need to get up.”</p><p>Rio groaned once more and reluctantly opened her eyes to see tired blue staring back at her. She raised her fingers up to touch Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“Did you sleep?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond and only rolled them over slowly to hover above Rio, this time not pressing down and against her.</p><p>Rio protested this by tugging at her weakly, her limbs not yet back to their full strength.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“You need to get up.”</p><p>“Kiss me once and I’ll go.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes as she waited for it and it took longer than she thought it might but soon the welcome feel of Agatha’s lips encircling her own was back and she hummed happily into it, feeling warmed from the inside out.</p><p>Agatha broke it after too short a time and Rio frowned where she was already pulling away and moving to fetch Rio’s discarded pants.</p><p>“That wasn’t the kind of kiss I was hoping for.”</p><p>“If I kiss you any longer I-…”</p><p>But Agatha was holding out her pants to her and Rio caught her eye and saw again that familiar reluctance to let her in.</p><p>So she turned away and slipped her jeans back on, running her hands through her bed head before daring to turn back to watch as Agatha quietly opened the door and slipped through to the main living area.</p><p>Rio followed silently and went to grab her discarded shoes and jacket and bag and went with Agatha to the door.</p><p>They hovered there, both standing silently in their uncertainty, both keeping hold of things unsaid.</p><p>“Have a safe flight,” Agatha eventually whispered, not quite meeting Rio’s eyes.</p><p>Rio reached for Agatha’s left hand and turned it over to kiss her ring finger purposefully, holding it against her lips in the exact spot where her ring should be. She then pressed her face against the back of her hand and breathed her in for a second before she turned to leave and stepped from Agatha’s shared suite with Nicky into the long hallway and back to her suite to pack her things and fly back to Toronto.</p>

I believe in our gal</p><p>@RiHag: Heard from a friend Rio referred to the kid as her own? Anyone else hear that? #DaddyVidal</p><p>@RiCnt: both. same time. raw. next question.</p></blockquote><p>It hadn’t been an easy couple of months.</p><p>But the first day had been the worst.</p><p>The news about Rio and Agatha attending a Celtics game together had broken not five minutes after they’d entered the stadium. There had been photos of them from every conceivable angle, in every imaginable pose, moment, and emotion.</p><p>Particular attention had been picked up online by Rio’s fans that she looked like Agatha’s son and imaginations had run wild as to why that was and questions as to how no one had noticed it before were plastered over gossip sites and Twitter timelines the world over.</p><p>And then there had been Alice.</p><p>Alice had blown up Rio’s phone two minutes after she’d arrived at the stadium.</p><p>Only Rio hadn’t even looked at her phone until she was on the way to the airport.</p><p>So Alice was furious.</p><p>They’d spent a week in a deeply unpleasant space with each other.</p><p>Rio was depressed and morose anyway and Alice was incandescent with her friend.</p><p>Alice had only eventually given in and conceded that it was probably a good move - albeit a needlessly sneaky one - on Rio’s behalf to be photographed being friendly with Agatha and her son. And Rio had no energy or desire to do anything but accept her apology.</p><p>And so they were back to normal.</p><p>And Rio had to live with the fact that people on the internet wanted her to be with Agatha almost as much as she herself wanted it.</p><p>But she hadn’t heard from her. It had been weeks and the last she’d seen of Agatha was her standing in the door to her suite wearing the jersey she’d had made for her.</p><p>The last she’d felt of her touch was when she’d held her hand to her face.</p><p>The last thing she’d heard her say to her was to ‘have a safe flight’.</p><p>And then radio silence.</p><p>She knew, when she could stand to tune into updates from Alice about Jen and Agatha, that she’d fallen out with Jennifer. She knew that they still weren’t on great terms and that Ralph had taken the whole thing badly too.</p><p>But she didn’t know anything else.</p><p>The only other news of Agatha came from the announcements of the Critics Choice Award nominations, followed swiftly by the Golden Globes. They both got nominations. And were both favourites to win.</p><p>Which meant only one thing to Rio: she’d be seeing Agatha in early January.</p><p>With two of the top five awards bodies already teeing both Rio and Agatha up to be potential winners, all talk had turned to which of them would top the other.</p><p>Which, ironically, was a lot of the chat about the two of them online as well.</p><p>But Rio had done all she could. She’d been as honest as Agatha had allowed her to be. And Agatha hadn’t reached back out, so Rio lived now in a liminal space: a space between loving Agatha and needing to move on.</p><p>But she’d promised to wait.</p><p>And so she began to resent that she had even decided to be in a movie that was awards fodder, let alone turn in a stellar performance in it. She began to hate herself for her aspirations, for wanting to be as good and as well respected as Agatha, because it had forced them together, it had meant that she’d fallen for her.</p><p>Fallen so hard and so painfully that she’d been celibate since Boston.</p><p>She’d taken to lying to Alice about the women she <em>wasn’t</em> sleeping with. Saying she was trying harder to date rather than to just shag. And Alice was pleased she was being more discerning. So she made up girls she’d matched with on Raya, and she flirted in front of her so she wouldn’t suspect that she’d lost her mind over a married mother.</p><p>And by late December she was beginning to feel a little more herself.</p><p>She’d acted her way into a better place.</p><p>She’d wrapped filming on her Toronto project and was back home for the holidays.</p><p>And her parents were staying with her, which was a blessing and a curse. It meant she got no alone time but also meant she had a full fridge and an even fuller stomach.</p><p>Her final piece of work was scheduled in for the day before Christmas Eve and much to her parents confusion it was reading thirst tweets for Buzzfeed.</p><p>“I can’t believe you told them what this was,” Rio was saying as her blusher was topped up and an anxious Alice was shuffling in front of her.</p><p>“It slipped out, okay? I’m not sure they understood anyway.”</p><p>“Yeah, telling them people on the internet were writing dirty stuff about their daughter wasn’t exactly the Christmas present I was hoping you’d get them.”</p><p>“Actually I got your mom a nice scarf and your dad some whiskey. This was just a treat.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and swung for Alice, narrowly missing her shoulder as she stepped back.</p><p>“No hitting. I didn’t bring a change of outfit and I don’t want your grubby paws ruining my shirt before my flight.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes again but said nothing more, knowing Alice was anxious enough as it was because as soon as this shoot was done she was hopping a flight to Indianapolis to spend Christmas with Jen’s family.</p><p>“Relax,” she said as the makeup artist moved away and one of the producers was making his way over. “They’ll love you.”</p><p>“Easy for you to say, everyone loves you.”</p><p>Rio grinned widely to hide the twinge of sadness that told her she could name one person who didn’t.</p><p>But grinning helped. It almost felt real.</p><p>“Rio! Are you ready? Not vetting these first is crazy, by the way. We’ve thrown in some absolute zingers.”</p><p>Rio laughed and Alice began to chew on her lip.</p><p>“Maybe we should have.”</p><p>“C’mon. We see loads all the time. You’re constantly reading them out to me and laughing about them.”</p><p>Alice hummed her disapproval and Rio sighed as she turned back to the producer and took the phone offered to her.</p><p>“Swiping right through them?”</p><p>“Yeah. Tried to put them in a random order so some will be more tame than others. We’ll just point and shoot and edit out any that make you want to vomit.”</p><p>“Fine, I’ve a strong stomach.”</p><p>Rio was left alone then, perched on a small director’s chair in the middle of a blank backdrop, and she watched as everyone took their seats behind the camera and Alice’s smile returned to her face once she saw how Rio looked on the monitor.</p><p>She took it as a sign that she looked good.</p><p>“Ready when you are, Rio!”</p><p>Rio nodded and held her phone up to swipe up and read the first screenshot of a tweet.</p><p>She laughed. Genuinely. Loudly. And then looked to the camera with a raised brow.</p><p>“Hi I’m Rio Vidal and I’m here today with Buzzfeed to read thirst tweets.”</p><p>She dropped her gaze to the phone again and clicked her tongue. “God what a way to start.”</p><p>“@RidalsGal1 says: ‘I have two perfectly good holes and one needy mouth and none of them are full of @RioVidal. America please explain.’” Rio laughed again and looked at the camera.</p><p>“Jesus.”</p><p>She swiped the screen until the next tweet came up and whistled a low note as she read it over before voicing it: “@Darby789 says: ‘All I want for Christmas is for @RioVidal to use me as her personal’… oh my god,” she cleared her throat but her lips twitched into a crooked grin, partly for the camera and partly because she couldn’t believe what she was about to say: “‘use me as her personal cum bucket’.”</p><p>She ran a hand through her hair and looked up at the camera with raised brows, “Gimme a time and a place and I’ll be there.”</p><p>She heard Alice laugh and smirked as she looked to the next one: “@VidalsPlaything says @RioVidal I am free this Thursday for dinner and also anal thanks.’ Straight to the point. Like it.”</p><p>The next one she swiped to and laughed again, her tongue poking in her cheek as she chuckled and tried to get a grip on herself. “Jesus, man. You guys are <em>freaks</em>. Okay, @RioRioRio says: ‘Need @RioVidal biblically. Like, fist so far up my ass she’s wearing me like Kermit the Frog.’ <em>Dios mío!</em>”</p><p>She dropped the phone to her lap and looked back up to the camera, remembering the chat she’d had before with Alice and the producer; “make sure you comment briefly between each read”, “feel free to pause or laugh or whatever you need to do”, “try to react as naturally as possible”, “flirt, Rio. You’re excellent at it.”</p><p>“Listen, I’m pretty busy right now but I might have fisting time in the new year. I’ll keep you in mind.”</p><p>She looked back to the next one and smiled as she adjusted her free arm over her lap, “Okay this one is pretty sweet, actually. ‘@VidalsWife says ‘If I had one nickel for every time I’ve masturbated to thoughts of @RioVidal I’d be the richest woman in the world.’ Sweet. Romantic, even.”</p><p>She smirked at the camera and flicked to the next one.</p><p>“@Feral4Vidal says: ‘I love Rio Vidal’ and then it brackets it says… ‘I want Rio Vidal to rail me’.” She snickered and groaned as she grinned, “with all these requests I’m going to be a busy girl.”</p><p>And here is where she paused, when she swiped for her next tweet, and almost lost her composure. Because Agatha’s name was the first thing she saw.</p><p>“@HarknessHymen: ‘Feeling v French today. @RioVidal and #AgathaHarkness how would you feel about recreating the Eiffel Tower with me to celebrate?’” She forced a laugh, forced her smile to remain on her face. “I’ll text her later. Thanks for asking so politely.”</p><p>“Man, oh man, you people. I hope you don’t kiss your mothers with these mouths.”</p><p>She cleared her throat and shifted in her seat, beginning to toy with her hair as she read the next: “From @GayDream13 says ‘Sometimes Rio Vidal is so mommy and sometimes she’s so daddy I don’t know whether I want to suckle or suck.’” She laughed and took herself by surprise at it, blushing ever so slightly as she rocked her head back and grinned. “Christ.”</p><p>“Honestly this is the weirdest ego boost I’ve ever had.”</p><p>“@RiosToothGap says… oh god. They say: ‘I hope Rio knows she has an army of women willing to crawl miles over broken glass just to beg her to spit on them’.”</p><p>“I mean… how many miles, guys? Be specific please. Details.”</p><p>She looked up with a grin and saw Alice indicate one more and so she looked down to the next tweet on offer. And Agatha’s name was there again.</p><p>She cleared her throat quietly and read it over properly, feeling her jaw clench as each passing word made her feel increasingly more uncomfortable.</p><p><em>@Whre4Rio: I wouldn’t even want to join. I just want to live in a world where Rio Vidal knows what Agatha Harkness’s puss tastes like.</em></p><p>The recent flurry of internet interest in Agatha and Rio’s relationship that caught the attention of almost every journalist worth their salt. So Buzzfeed were clearly no different.</p><p>Most had focused on the rivals turned friends angle and some industry-focused journos had been deliberating and debating over whether this was a clever PR stunt for more attention, for more votes.</p><p>But Alice had told Rio that her Twitter was full of tweets like these and Rio was able to laugh most of them off, to roll her eyes and smile as Alice read them out, but sometimes they hit that little soft part of herself that wanted to cry instead of laugh.</p><p>She stared at it for a while and in her peripheral vision saw Alice moving a little as if to come to her. But she looked up before she could and shook her head slightly, “I’m sorry. Not this one. Can we cut that out and I’ll read one more.”</p><p>“Sure sure,” came the voice of the producer, keen to make sure Rio could continue comfortably and not ruin what he and his colleagues knew would be a huge hit for them on their YouTube channel. “Whatever you want. Start from the top on the next one.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and swiped to get the next tweet up. She scanned it over and then looked to the camera with her smile back in place, “Everyone seems to think I wanna hurt people but I promise I’m actually every nice.”</p><p>She looked back at the tweet and read: “@D1ckD4re says ‘Rio Vidal could run me over, spit on my mangled body, and burn me to ash and I’d come back and thank her for it.’ I mean… I don’t want to do that but if you really want it then I guess who am I to say no?”</p><p>She laughed at her little joke, hamming it up for the camera to make up for her refusal to read the last tweet and then she dropped the phone and smiled, “Am I done humiliating myself now? Is everybody satisfied or would anyone like me to provide my services as a puppeteer?”</p><p>She held her hand up with a grin and wriggled her fingers, much to the delight of the video producers who now had their perfect end to an expertly performed video.</p><p>“We got it!” The main producer shouted and Rio raised her brows as Alice rushed in.</p><p>“You did? Need me to repeat or-…?”</p><p>“No, honest, Rio. You gave us everything we needed.”</p><p>Rio smiled and held the phone back out as she stood from her seat, “They were… Jesus.”</p><p>“Told you.”</p><p>“Hey. Amazing. Which did you skip?”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio shrugged and was grateful the phone was gone so Alice couldn’t make her show the tweet in question.</p><p>“Just one about… just felt a bit weird.”</p><p>“Okay. Well you fucking nailed it.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p><p>“Must be all that sex you’ve not been having lately.”</p><p>Rio only hummed at Alice’s whispered words and moved with her to begin making the rounds, thanking everyone and saying their goodbyes and merry christmases as they finally, after a long day, left the little studio.</p><p>Outside by Rio’s old hybrid is where Alice pulled her best friend down into a tight hug.</p><p>“I’ll miss you.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and held Alice tightly against herself, turning her head after a few seconds to kiss her cheek.</p><p>“It’s just a few days.”</p><p>“Say it back, you bitch.”</p><p>Rio laughed and pulled away, “I’ll miss you too.”</p><p>Alice hummed and went to remove her bags from the back of Rio’s car, “You make sure your mom leaves me plenty of food, okay? Jen’s promised an anti inflammatory menu and… I think by the time I’m back I’ll be craving anything <em>other</em> than whatever that means.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, it’s practically a production factory in my poor little kitchen. I’ll try not to eat it all.”</p><p>“Very much appreciated,” Alice grinned as she shouldered her duffel and slammed the door shut.</p><p>Her expression softened as she took Rio in and Rio just knew she was about to ask her the same question she’d been asking her since she got back from Boston: “Anything you want to talk to me about?”</p><p>Rio knew she’d not kept her low moods hidden particularly well but she couldn’t reveal the truth for fear of outing Agatha so secrecy was important. It was paramount.</p><p>“No. Go and have a great time with your beautiful girlfriend and call me every day, okay?”</p><p>“Okay. I love you, idiot. Behave. Don’t run off on anymore trips that make my girlfriend furious.”</p><p>“Noted. I love you too.”</p><p>Rio left Alice to walk off towards the uber that had just arrived to take her to the airport and she felt her body shrink in on itself a little, feeling at ease now she was alone and had no secrets to keep.</p><p>The drive back to her home took less than an hour and she found herself singing along to random Christmas songs played by the local radio station.</p><p>They were cheesy but they were better than sitting in silence with her thoughts or scrolling through her podcast app trying to find something she could be bothered to focus on.</p><p>She slammed the car door shut and made her way into her home, the smell of fresh cooking filling her lungs as she closed the door behind her.</p><p>“¡Hola! Mamá, papá!”</p><p>A bag on the console table by the door caught her eye but she ignored it, assuming it was an old tote bag of hers and perhaps her mum had used it to go pick up some last minute groceries.</p><p>But what really surprised her was that no one had shouted back.</p><p>She dropped her keys into the little bowl on the side and slowly moved through the house, looking this way and that until her last resort was to head out to the back to see if they’d taken themselves out to enjoy wait remained of the December sun.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio raised her brows when she came round the side of the house and saw her parents sitting on the little bench with two chairs she recognised from her dining room sitting opposite them and a blanket stolen from her bed lying on the floor before them with the remnants of what looked like a picnic.</p><p>“¿Qué pasó?”</p><p>Anna Vidal looked up with a wide smile where she sat beside her husband, cradling one of Rio’s large mugs in her hands.</p><p>“We had guests.”</p><p>“Guests?”</p><p>“Invitadas,” her dad confirmed with a wink.</p><p>Rio raised her brows as she surveyed the evidence of these guests. She sat in one of the seats as her mum offered an explanation.</p><p>“Your friend arrived with gifts an hour after you left with Alice.”</p><p>“Amiga bonita,” her dad added unhelpfully but Rio shot him a small smile, wracking her brains for who was in town and who might stop by the day before Christmas Eve.</p><p>Wanda?</p><p>“She had gifts and her son wanted to see you.”</p><p><em>Agatha.</em></p><p>“Mom, was it Agatha?”</p><p>Rio’s heart rate went through the roof and she wondered how long it would be before her Apple Watch buzzed and told her she was working out.</p><p>But her mum seemed to not notice and was taking a sip of tea before responding.</p><p>“Sí, sí, Agatha y Nicky.”</p><p>If Rio hadn’t been sitting she might have fainted.</p><p>“They…”</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the remnants of the picnic and she saw suddenly the telltale signs of a demolished plate of tostones along with guac and a bowl that definitely at some point earlier had had ice cream in it.</p><p>“You need to buy some furniture.”</p><p>“<em>Mamá</em>,” Rio insisted suddenly, keen to find out everything about how and why Agatha and Nicky had been in her house with her parents when she’d had no knowledge that they were even coming.</p><p>“How long did they stay?”</p><p>“¡Bah!” Anna exclaimed with a laugh and a wave of her hand, “Long enough to teach the little one how to make tostones and for your papá to bore Agatha to death with tales of your childhood.”</p><p>Rio felt sick again.</p><p>“Dad,” she said and turned to see her dad smiling at her and had to look away for fear she’d relent instead of remaining firm in her quest for details.</p><p>“So? What? Hours?”</p><p>“Sí.”</p><p>Rio ran a hand through her hair and cleared her throat.</p><p>“What’s wrong, mija? I’m sure if you called you could-…”</p><p>“How was she? Was she…?”</p><p>“Encantadora, educada, nerviosa.” <em>Charming, polite, nervous.</em></p><p>“Nervous?”</p><p>“Ella se calmó.” <em>She calmed down.</em></p><p>Rio nodded slowly and felt her father’s eyes on her even as she focused in on her mom.</p><p>“And Nicky?”</p><p>Anna looked to her husband and then turned back to Rio slowly, a small frown appearing on her face, “Él tiene tu cara.” <em>He has your face.</em></p><p>“I know,” Rio said in a much softer tone than before.</p><p>“Was he okay?”</p><p>“Shy. He was looking for you.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, and took a second to process all this before she spoke again, “Did you like them?”</p><p>“Very much.”</p><p>“¿Quién no lo haría?” <em>Who wouldn’t?</em></p><p>Rio smiled a little and dropped her gaze to a lone breadstick in a cup and took it.</p><p>“You’ll spoil dinner.”</p><p>“I’m starving.”</p><p>Really she just wanted something to do.</p><p>Anna hummed and Rio smiled as she took a big bite.</p><p>“You don’t want to look at your gifts?”</p><p>She almost choked.</p><p>“Gifts?” She spluttered, her dad moving to come around and smack her back to help.</p><p>“Gracias,” she mumbled as she cleared her throat loudly, “What g-…?”</p><p>But her mom had said Agatha had brought gifts and she almost choked again but this time on nothing. She stood and looked at her dad who was smiling warmly at her with raised brows and she caught something in his eye that told her everything she needed to know about what Miguel Vidal had guessed already.</p><p>“They’re under the tree,” her mom said with a wave of her hand and Rio nodded, turning back to shoot her a smile before she disappeared inside, moving so fast she was practically jogging.</p><p>Once back inside Rio took a deep breath and placed her hand over her heart to feel it thrumming it’s thumping rhythm against her ribcage.</p><p>Weeks and weeks of nothing and then this. Showing up to her house with gifts, with Nicky. Staying and chatting with her dad. Her mom taking the time to teach Nicky how to cook.</p><p>It didn’t make sense.</p><p>She moved to the tree and crouched beside it, immediately knowing the gifts that must be from Agatha.</p><p>Since childhood she’d had a bad habit of feeling and shaking her gifts, ripping them just enough to be able to see what she had before Christmas morning.</p><p>It was a habit her parents tried to shake her out of but one she’d never truly beaten.</p><p>And each gift dotted around the foot of the tree had small rips in them, evidence of Rio’s impatience.</p><p>Only two gifts at the front looked untouched.</p><p>And both had cards leaning against them.</p><p>Under no circumstances did Rio think she could wait two days to find out what they were so she picked the first card up and recognised immediately the handwriting of a seven year old.</p><p>Her name was written in large, wobbling letters and there was a small sticker of Santa in the corner that smiled dispassionately up at her.</p><p>She smiled back at it and then turned it over to open it.</p><p>Inside was a slim photograph rather than the card she was expecting.</p><p>She pulled it out front first and saw that it was the picture Agatha had taken of her and Nicky; the one where their caps were backwards and Nicky was grinning up at Rio who grinned back down at him.</p><p>It was shocking, really, how long it had taken Rio to see the resemblance. But it was there. As bright and obvious as the smiles on their faces.</p><p>She turned it over and with a pang saw that Nicky had written her a message and Rio hadn’t thought to send anything to him.</p><p><em>Dear Rio, wishing you a very happy Christmas and a happy new year. Go Celtics! Love, Nicky.</em></p><p>She saw beneath the boy’s wobbly handwriting the faint pencil marks that must have been Agatha’s, guiding her son’s message.</p><p>Turning it back over to see their smiling faces again she had to swallow down the guilt she felt that not only had Nicky written to her, he’d wanted to see her.</p><p>And she’d not sent him anything.</p><p>She placed the card aside and took up the gift she assumed was from him, unwrapping it uncharacteristically gingerly until she held a brand new Celtics scarf in her hands.</p><p>She laughed as she draped it around her neck and turned then to the next card.</p><p>God she hoped there wasn’t a photo of Agatha in there.</p><p>She wasn’t sure she could handle seeing that right now.</p><p>She opened it blindly, having closed her eyes as she did so. Her fingers felt along the edges until she found it to be a card and she blinked down at the image that looked back at her.</p><p>The illustration was of a colourful little bay, drawn by an artist to represent Positano.</p><p>It was almost worse than an image of Agatha.</p><p>She opened it to see loopy handwriting, much neater than her son’s.</p><p><em>Rio, Merry Christmas. You once told Nicky the color green was lucky. I hope this has some luck in it too. Agatha.</em></p><p>Rio frowned at the message, her forefinger tracing the loops of Agatha’s signature and feeling the soft indent of her pen there.</p><p>Any remnant of Agatha was now precious.</p><p>She put the card aside to pick up the gift that had been left beneath it and opened that in the same way she had Nicky’s.</p><p>Inside the neat wrappings was a box with the initials HW on the front.</p><p><em>Harry Winston.</em></p><p>Rio hesitated before she opened it, knowing that whatever was inside would be beautiful and expensive.</p><p>And it was.</p><p>Sitting on a deep navy cushion was a gold pendant necklace, with a perfectly round emerald encased by a gold setting. It was delicate and Rio touched it equally delicately, wondering when Agatha had decided she’d buy her a gift, wondering when she’d decided she’d buy her <em>this</em> gift.</p><p>“Rio! You bad child,” came her mom’s voice from the other end of the room, “You cannot open gifts now!”</p><p>Rio barely reacted and chewed on her lip as she closed the little box and picked up the cards and the wrappings.</p><p>“I need to shower and then I’ll be down for dinner, okay?”</p><p>Her mom just waved a hand in dismissal and Rio disappeared up the stairs with her treasures, depositing the discarded wrappings in the trash as she went.</p><p>When in her room she jumped on her bed and lay out her gifts before her like a collector admiring her latest finds.</p><p>She stared at each one in turn, wondering why it hadn’t crossed her mind to even send a card. To at least buy Nicky something.</p><p>But then, she supposed, never in a million years had she assumed Agatha would give her a gift.</p><p>She pulled her phone out and ignored the texts and calls that filled her home screen and found Agatha’s contact in WhatsApp.</p><p>7:14pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I didn’t get the memo about exchanging gifts.</p><p>Simple. Casual. Letting Agatha know she knew she should have sent something.</p><p>She placed her phone down just as the response came through.</p><p>7:15pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: A strange way to say thank you.</p><p>7:16pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I should be saying sorry. I hear you spent the afternoon with my parents</p><p>7:16pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: They were great.</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip, her thumbs doing their familiar dance over the keypad as she leant over her phone.</p><p>7:19pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Can you tell Nicky I’m sorry I missed him?</p><p>7:22pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I will.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t giving much. But this was the first she’d heard from Agatha in weeks and she wasn’t willing to let it go so easily.</p><p>The lightweight metal of her battered iPhone felt suddenly heavy in her hands, suddenly precious because it was full of Agatha.</p><p>Casting aside her fear that Agatha might not even respond, she pressed on:</p><p>7:23pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Why would I need luck?</p><p>7:24pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Your mom warned me you might open your gifts.</p><p>7:24pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: It’s beautiful</p><p>7:25pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: The scarf or the necklace?</p><p>7:26pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Both. Can I call you?</p><p>7:26pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: My mother and in-laws are here.</p><p>7:27pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I’ll see you at the CCAs?</p><p>7:27pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Yes.</p><p>7:28pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Te veo</p><p>Rio put her phone down after that. Her gaze falling to the Harry Winston box and the image of Positano next to it.</p><p>She longed to be alone with Agatha again. Even if she couldn’t touch her. Just to see how she was. Just to know she was okay.</p><p>If she’d been nervous when she’d arrived earlier that day then that had to mean something. It had to mean she didn’t know how Rio would have received her.</p><p>It had to mean she cared.</p><p>Or she wouldn’t have brought her son. Wouldn’t have helped him write her card. Wouldn’t have gone to the trouble of picking theIr picture and getting it printed so Rio could keep it.</p><p>Wouldn’t have chosen Rio a necklace.</p><p>Rio spent the rest of the evening in a slight daze but tried her hardest to get more information out of her parents.</p><p>What she got was limited.</p><p>Yes: Agatha had spoken Spanish to them the whole time she was there.</p><p>Yes: her accent was good, yes she could teach Rio a thing or two about grammar.</p><p>Yes: Nicky had spoken a little in Spanish and where he couldn’t respond he’d used English.</p><p>Yes: he’d been shy all day.</p><p>Yes: every time the wind blew a certain way he’d turned to see if Rio had arrived home.</p><p>Yes: Agatha had taken Nicky away whilst Ralph entertained his parents and her mom.</p><p>No: she didn’t say much about it.</p><p>No: she hadn’t seemed bored or annoyed by her dad’s stories.</p><p>No: she didn’t try to leave quickly.</p><p>Yes: she’d asked how Rio had been.</p><p>It was flashes of an afternoon, delivered in rapid Spanish from her mother who was more interested in telling her about the family’s drama.</p><p>But it was all Rio had.</p><p>Agatha had told her she needed some time and Rio was giving her that. But she didn’t know how much time she had left in her.</p><p>But time moved still and before she could blink it was Christmas.</p><p>And Christmas Day was a soft day. A day where she could be in her pyjamas. A day where she’d felt emboldened by two mimosas with breakfast to send a photo to Agatha that went unanswered until the early evening.</p><p>She’d put her new necklace on even as she still wore her ratty old University of Delaware t-shirt and thrown the scarf artfully over herself too.</p><p>And she’s smiled like she might have done if the gifts had been handed to her personally by the people who’d bought them for her.</p><p>And in the soft lightning of her bedroom she’d sent the selfie; makeup free, and hopeful.</p><p>The response came much much later than she’d hoped it would.</p><p>9:13pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Green is your color.</p><p>Rio had been doom scrolling when the message came through, laid out on the sofa with a hoodie on over the pyjamas she’d been in all day. Her stomach was full and her wine glass was tragically empty but she could neither be bothered to refill it or bring herself to ask her mom watching <em>Love Actually</em> or rouse her sleeping dad in the armchair to get it for her.</p><p>Plenty of messages had been streaming through all day but this was the first she clicked into.</p><p>9:15pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: How has your day been?</p><p>9:17pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Fine. Yours?</p><p>9:17pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Quiet</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip as she waited for a reply but minutes went by and nothing and so she pulled her hood up and sulked silently about it, wondering if she should have been more witty or asked another question.</p><p>At the top of her spiral another text came through:</p><p>9:33pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: What’re you doing?</p><p>9:33pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I’m on the couch. Mom’s watching Love Actually</p><p>9:35pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Maybe next year she’ll be watching your Christmas movie.</p><p>Rio frowned at this message, unsure what Agatha was referring to until her wine-slowed brain kicked into gear again.</p><p>9:38pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Can’t believe you passed on it</p><p>9:40pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I have taste.</p><p>Rio smirked at her phone and danced her thumbs for a bit before she tapped back:</p><p>9:41pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: In necklaces, in women</p><p>The risk hadn’t paid off.</p><p>Agatha didn’t text back.</p><p>Rio sulked more and eventually took herself off to bed by ten thirty.</p><p>By the time Alice was back and the new year was celebrated with her parents leaving the day before, and with a messy, loud, house party to ring in the bells, Rio had blocked out her last, regrettable text to Agatha.</p><p>She’d been drunk out of her mind entering the new year and had just one more day of freedom before she had to get back to work with press events and fittings for the Critics Choice Awards on the 4th January.</p><p>And despite her reputation, Rio had remained true to her word.</p><p>She’d kept her hands and her lips to herself during her party.</p><p>She even kept her tongue in her mouth whenever Agatha was mentioned and as drunk as she was she gave nothing away and only nodded and smiled when people mentioned her name to her.</p><p>The picture of her and Nicky sat hidden in her bathroom cabinet and her precious new necklace sat on her vanity.</p><p>But her mind, her heart, they were full of Agatha all the time. Full of the prospect of seeing her in three days, full of the idea that she might be able to hold her hand, if only secretly, and for a few stolen moments.</p><p>And maybe it was the start of the new year. Maybe it was that she’d rung it in surrounded by friends. But she felt hopeful for the first time in a while.</p>
