<p>
<span>
      Christmas, if you asked Agatha, was bullshit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And no, it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that she had no one to spend it with. She hated it because people acted like they suddenly cared about the fact that they were assholes the rest of the year. At the very least, they could own up to the fact that they couldn’t give a shit about it, like her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Instead, Agatha was stuck listening to trite diatribes about how this was the season for nonsense like family and forgiveness, two words that were more than a little foreign to her. Exhibit A: her mother still sent her passive aggressive Christmas cards with all of her friends’ daughters and their ugly husbands. If Agatha was lucky, there was an even uglier baby pictured too. These did not have the effect her mother wanted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      December was just beginning, but it seemed as though Christmas was everywhere already. Even more so when Agatha got a call from Jennifer Kale of all people.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What do you want?” Agatha asked as soon as she picked up the phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Agatha Harkness, once a bitch, always a bitch,”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Jennifer replied without missing a beat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was glad Jennifer couldn’t see the smile that tugged at her lips. Even though they couldn’t go more than five minutes without sniping at each other, Agatha considered Jennifer one of her closest friends. They didn’t talk as often these days, but it was one of those friendships where it felt as though no time had passed whenever they spoke.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, did you need something or are you going to admit that you miss me?” Agatha said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could practically see Jennifer’s eye roll. Her words dripped with disdain as she said,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       “You’re making it incredibly difficult to invite you to a Christmas party I’m hosting.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Pass,” Agatha said blandly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Don’t be like that,”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Jennifer said.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       “I’m inviting everyone from college, and I think it’d be nice for all of us to see each other.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A stab of anxiety caught Agatha in the chest. “Who do you mean when you say everyone?” There was a moment of hesitation, but it was enough to confirm Agatha’s suspicion. “Absolutely not,” she said. “I am not going to a party if she’s going to be there.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Agatha, come on,”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Jennifer protested.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       “It’s been over a year!”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Jennifer, one does not see their ex after the worst break-up known to man,” Agatha said, speaking slowly as if she was explaining something to a particularly stupid child. “Honestly, I can’t believe you think it’d be a good idea.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I want to see all my friends during a holiday that’s all about togetherness, so sue me,”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Jennifer huffed. There was some shuffling noise from the other end of the phone before Jennifer continued,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       “Can’t you be civil for just one night?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha injected as venom as she could into the singular word, “No.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Billy is going to be there,”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Jennifer tried.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was enough to make Agatha pause, and she absolutely loathed Jennifer for it. For eight years, Agatha had been neighbors with Billy Kaplan, and as annoying as the kid was, he’d grown on her. Since she moved, she’d felt the loss acutely. And no, she wasn't lonely. He just used to get the mail for her and would do the more troublesome chores for some quick cash. That was all.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No,” Agatha said again, but even she could hear that it wasn’t as strong as it was before. Shaking her head, Agatha said, “Billy is welcome to come see me whenever he wants. It doesn’t have to be at this party.” Absently, Agatha found a pen and wrote a note to herself to call Billy herself later. It’d been a while since she heard from the kid.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I get it now,”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Jennifer said, and Agatha felt herself tense at her sudden sly tone.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       “You’re afraid, aren’t you?”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha sputtered, trying to protest, but Jennifer just kept going,
      <em>
       “The big bad Agatha Harkness is too afraid to face her ex because she’s still lonely and pining for her. Is that it?”
      </em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am not!” Agatha exclaimed. Her? Afraid? As if. “I’m actually dating someone, FYI.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then bring her,” Jennifer said. A challenge, and Agatha couldn’t not take it. It was the spite in her. “I mean, if you’ve got nothing to hide, like your sad, sad life without Rio?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had already been steadily growing aggravated by the conversation, but it was the mention of her name that pushed Agatha over the edge. Face hot, Agatha all but yelled into the phone, “Fine! I will.” As soon as the words left her mouth, she grimaced and dragged a hand over her face. She fell right into that one. “You’re a fucking bitch.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “And you are way too easy,”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Jennifer replied smugly.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       “The party is at my place, December 14th. Dress nicely, and I’m talking dresses and suits. 6 PM. Do not be late, Agatha.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fuck you,” Agatha managed to say, just before Jennifer hung up on her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Technically, Agatha could just not go to the party. There was nothing making her go. Even if Jennifer got pissed or Billy was disappointed, Agatha knew they’d both get over it eventually. At the same time, as much as Agatha didn’t want to admit it, it would be nice to see everyone. Since the break-up, Agatha hadn’t seen any of them. At first, it had been too hard, and now, it felt too strange. Their friends from college and Billy had been the closest thing to family Agatha had known for a long time, but it also hadn’t felt right to meet with them without Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then again, it was Rio’s fault that it all had to end.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Fuck it, Agatha thought. Rio didn’t have sole claim to their friends and Billy. She was going to that party, and she was going to bring a date.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hadn’t been lying when she told Jennifer she was dating someone. It just wasn’t very serious, which was how Agatha liked it. For about three months now, Agatha had been dating Wanda, a pretty redhead she’d met at a bookstore. They’d both been looking for the same book and hit it off from there. Wanda was very sweet, but as good as Wanda liked to act, Agatha liked that she could tease the worst out of her. It was an easy and fun relationship, something much more casual than the eight year-long commitment she’d just gotten out of. Not to mention, Wanda was nothing like Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Agatha brought up the party to Wanda, the other woman agreed easily, happy to tag along and meet her friends. “You know, I was beginning to think you made them up,” Wanda teased. Agatha had faked a laugh and merely told her the date and time in reply.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The night of the party, Agatha was antsy. It wasn’t that she was nervous or anything equally ridiculous. She just wanted to get it over with, really. All of this Christmas crap. Just before picking Wanda up, Agatha took a shot of whiskey and shook out her arms. Nothing to worry about here. Just seeing some old friends and her ex, who Agatha definitely had not warned Wanda about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, look at you,” Wanda said warmly when she got into the car. She gave her a peck on the cheek. “You look great.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You too,” Agatha replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While Wanda was wearing a green dress that brought out her eyes, Agatha was wearing a dark red suit and a black turtleneck. They looked disgustingly spirited, and Agatha shifted uneasily at just how picturesque they would look together. Rio had often wore all black, leaving Agatha to wear whatever color she wanted without fear of looking too matching or clashing. Agatha forgot what it was like to actually coordinate with someone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, what can I expect from everyone?” Wanda asked as they drove to Jennifer’s townhome.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They’re nothing special,” Agatha answered flippantly. From the corner of her eye, she saw the look Wanda gave her and sighed. “Well, Jennifer is kind of a bitch, but she’ll probably be nice to you. Alice couldn’t hurt a fly. Lilia will be fine once she’s had a glass of wine. Billy is annoying, but he’s harmless. And Rio–” Agatha stopped herself abruptly, unsure of what to say.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio?” Wanda prompted, glancing at her curiously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio is weird,” Agatha settled on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Thankfully, this just made Wanda giggle, “Weird? That’s it?” She placed her hand on Agatha’s thigh, squeezing it. “If that’s it, I think I’ll be just fine.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Right,” Agatha said, more to herself than Wanda. “What could go wrong?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When they arrived, Jennifer let them in with hugs for them both, and that was how Agatha knew she was probably already on her second or third glass of wine. She never hugged her otherwise. Besides Jennifer, Lilia, Alice, and Billy were all already there, and they all greeted her warmly. Billy was the only other one to hug her, and the only reason she let him was because as he wrapped his arms around her, he very quietly said, “I’ve missed you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha introduced Wanda to everyone, and once a glass of spiced wine was pressed into her hand, the whole party thing didn’t seem so bad.  It was nice to catch up with everyone, and there was still that comfortable camaraderie that came with people you'd known for a long time. Agatha was sitting on the couch with Wanda when she heard a painfully familiar voice say from the front door, “Aw, come on, Jen. Getting started without me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I said six, Rio,” Jennifer replied with a laugh. “It’s not my fault you can’t be on time to save your life.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, well, I’m here now, aren’t I?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio walked in, looking unchanged from a year ago, and somehow, that hit Agatha harder than if she’d looked different. Her hair was still long, dark, and smooth, falling a few inches past her shoulder. Her lips still curled into that sardonic smile, and her eyes still lit up with mirth. God, she still looked good too, dressed in a green dress just short enough to catch a wandering eye and a black blazer on top.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hadn’t seen her since the break-up, and all thoughts of what to do or say left her immediately. For a moment, she forgot anyone else was in the room with them. Why had they broken up? Why had Agatha let her go? Why was she just sitting there instead of getting up and going to her?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before her thoughts could get very far though, Agatha suddenly became aware of the woman standing next to Rio. It was a beautiful redheaded woman, and the fact that they had both shown up with redheads made a hysterical laugh bubble in Agatha’s chest. The woman was practically a model, classical features and curves that would make anyone drool.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Who the fuck was she?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey,” Rio greeted the room simply. Her eyes glanced over everyone before settling on Agatha. She didn’t look surprised to see her. If anything she looked expectant. Rio smiled, and Agatha tensed. She knew that look. She knew that look was the equivalent to a shit-eating grin on anyone else. It was the kind of smile Rio wore just before she won a bet or pinned Agatha to their bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio grabbed the hand of the woman next to her and said, “Everyone, this is Natasha. She’s my lovely date this evening.” Then, Rio leaned in and kissed the woman, Natasha, on the lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was nothing more than a quick peck, but Agatha felt her hands tighten around the glass of her hands. When Rio pulled away, her eyes found Agatha’s once more, dark and knowing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With a glare, Agatha tossed back the rest of her wine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      If that was how she was going to act, fine. Two could play at this game, couldn’t they?

<div>
<p>
     Rio knew it was a bad idea to go to Jennifer’s Christmas party.
    </p>
<p>
     You didn’t just show up to a party, knowing your ex was going to be there. Especially when you were the one did the breaking up.
    </p>
<p>
     In her defense, Rio had missed her friends, and maybe, just maybe, she wanted to see Agatha too. Just because she was the one who ended things didn’t mean she just stopped loving and missing her.
    </p>
<p>
     So, yeah, Rio decided to go to Jennifer’s Christmas party. She knew she couldn’t go alone though, not if she was going to face Agatha. Dumper she may be, but she knew if Agatha gave her even the slightest inkling she wanted to get back together that she’d cave in a heartbeat. Less than that, really.
    </p>
<p>
     That was how Rio ended up taking Natasha, her new roommate.
    </p>
<p>
     After the break-up, neither Rio nor Agatha wanted to stay in the house that had been theirs for the last eight years. Too many memories. Instead, they went their separate ways to new apartments. Rio could have very well afforded one by herself, but after living with another person for so long, the thought of being alone unsettled her more than she wanted to admit.
    </p>
<p>
     Natasha had been a friend of a friend, also looking for a roommate, and it just sort of worked out. And because Natasha was the best roommate ever (and bored, mainly bored), she was coming to the Christmas party as her fake girlfriend.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell me more about our torrid love affair,” Natasha had said to her the night before the party.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m an idiot,” Rio had groaned. She buried her face in her hands. She was stretched out on the couch, leaving her feet in Natasha’s lap. “No need to remind me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, this is too good to not remind you,” Natasha had replied. “Is it really that big of a deal that your ex is going to be there?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ll get it when you see her,” Rio had said.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, as soon as she could at the party, Natasha did in fact lean over to Rio and whisper, “I definitely get it now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s reassuring,” Rio sighed. “I think.”
    </p>
<p>
     Natasha smirked over her glass of wine, eyes still on Agatha. She leaned closer and said, “Agatha is hot, like really hot. How’d you ever leave the house?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re really not helping,” Rio hissed.
    </p>
<p>
     “All I’m saying,” Natasha sang, “is that she could bend me–”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you Rio’s girlfriend?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hand clamped around Natasha’s wrist in warning, making sure she didn’t finish her sentence. It was Billy who’d asked the question, springing up in front of them like a fungus. Maybe that was a rude comparison, but it felt apt. Rio didn’t really mind Billy, but he’d always been much closer to Agatha than he’d ever been with her.
    </p>
<p>
     Natasha eyed Billy curiously before she glanced at Rio. When Rio just shrugged, Natasha said, “Something like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy’s eyebrows furrowed. He looked between the two of them, clearly trying to puzzle out what was happening. “I thought you loved Agatha,” Billy said accusingly, and wow, Rio was glad Natasha wasn’t actually her girlfriend or else she’d have to strangle the brat for saying that in front of her. “I mean, I guess I just thought–”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d go crawling back to her?” Rio asked dryly. She watched as a flush made its way up Billy’s neck. Good. Sixteen was too old to be acting like the petulant little boy standing in front of her. Rio made a point to wrap her arm around Natasha’s waist and pull her closer. “As you can see, Billy, I’m doing just fine,” Rio said. “Happy, even.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy clenched his jaw, wearing a scowl remarkably similar to Agatha’s, before sulking back to her ex. Rio wondered what he’d say to her. No doubt something about how she was better off without her.
    </p>
<p>
     Sighing, Rio turned to pour herself some more wine. As she did, Natasha said, “Not to give you some false hope, but your ex is looking at me like she’d really like to stab me in the eye with the stem of her wine glass.”
    </p>
<p>
     Despite herself, Rio laughed. “How specific.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think she’d settle for a knife too,” Natasha joked.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, wine glass stem is the exact level of dramatics I’d expect from her,” Rio said with a grin. She turned back around, fast enough that Agatha couldn’t school her expression in time. Natasha was right. She did look like she wanted nothing more than to murder both Rio and Natasha. It struck Rio as unfair that Agatha seemed so upset about Natasha though. Agatha quite literally brought her own date too, a gorgeous redhead with a kind smile that everyone seemed to adore already. It had taken Rio almost three months to get their friend group to stop calling her a scary bitch. “Tonight’s going to be a blast,” Rio said sarcastically as she looked away from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Funny you say that,” Natasha murmured.
    </p>
<p>
     Her tone was what alerted her. Rio looked up just in time to see Agatha standing and making her way over to them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck me,” Rio breathed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure she would if you asked,” Natasha teased.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, of course, Agatha walked up to them just as Rio elbowed Natasha hard in the ribs. Rio cleared her throat and put on a polite smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to introduce Natasha, but she suddenly wasn’t there. When Rio looked around, she bit back a curse when she saw her across the room talking to Wanda. Oh, Rio was going to kill her.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s Natasha,” Rio said lamely, pointing to her as if Agatha wouldn’t know who she was. There were only so many other people in the room, and Agatha knew all of them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha followed her gesture though, staring at Natasha for a long moment. When she turned back to Rio, she looked like a shark who’d just scented blood in the water. “You sure moved on fast,” Agatha said brightly, and only an idiot would miss that it was an insult.
    </p>
<p>
     “So did you,” Rio pointed out.
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t leave me with much of a choice,” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did I?” Rio said. She bit her lip, worrying it with her teeth. She didn’t want to get into this right now. Or ever, really. Sighing, she said, “Listen, I’m here to see our friends. That’s it. We can get along for one night, can’t we?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s up to you,” Agatha shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel her patience rapidly decline as irritation flared inside her. “How the hell is it up to me?” Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you control yourself?” Agatha asked condescendingly. She wore a pouty smile, a pitying look that made fury pool in Rio’s stomach. “I remember what you’re like after a few drinks.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck you,” Rio spat, careful not to raise her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t bat an eyelash though. Her smile grew as she said, “And you’d like that wouldn’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn’t going to take this lying down, and she swiftly replied, “Only as much as you would.”
    </p>
<p>
     There it was. Agatha’s jaw clenched, and Rio felt a rush of victory. As the silence went on, Rio watched as Agatha’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly. Then, the smile was back, bright and forced and warning. “I wouldn’t enjoy it,” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Liar,” Rio laughed. When she leaned in, Agatha flinched but didn’t move away. In a low voice, Rio said to her, “I saw you check me out when I walked in.” Rio knew she shouldn’t do this. She was supposed to be the bigger person here. She shouldn’t, but she also couldn’t stop herself. Not when Agatha was so clearly trying to get a rise out of her. If that was what she wanted, Rio wanted to make sure she could handle it in return. “You couldn’t take your eyes off my legs,” Rio whispered to her. “You always did like them though. What was your favorite position again? With them over your shoulders when–” Rio gasped. Her words were cut short as wine dripped down her chest. Rio looked between her dress and Agatha’s now empty glass, feeling her cheeks redden.
    </p>
<p>
     All eyes were on them now, but Rio was only focused on staring into Agatha’s. Her blue eyes met hers, unrepentant, furious, and beautiful. Rio’s hand closed around her own glass. She took a deep breath. A myriad of emotions flickered through her. As was common with Agatha, she didn’t know if she wanted to kiss her or slap her.
    </p>
<p>
     It was Rio who looked away first.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you’ll excuse me,” Rio said lightly, addressing the rest of the room, all of whom were staring at them in silent shock. “I’m going to get cleaned up.” With that, Rio walked out of the room, wondering if she really had made a mistake in coming tonight.

<div>
<p>
     There was a ringing in her ears as Agatha watched Rio walk away from her, an image that she was becoming painfully familiar with. She wasn’t sure how long she stood there until someone touched her arm.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha jumped, taking a half-step back, when she realized it was Wanda at her side. Instinctively, she tried to smile, but it came out crooked and hesitant. Rio’s words still felt loud in her mind, leaving her off kilter. Agatha tried to focus on Wanda’s hand on the small of her back, but it felt too warm, even through the fabric of her blazer.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can we talk?” Wanda asked softly, and Agatha could only nod.
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them stepped out into the hallway, standing in the small space by the front door. Wanda’s hand never left her back, even though Agatha wished she’d just back away and give her some space.
    </p>
<p>
     “So,” Wanda said, “want to explain what all that was?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. She finally moved away from Wanda’s touch, leaning against the front door. She rested her head back against the wood and tried to come up with an answer that wouldn’t get her in too much trouble. “Rio’s my ex,” Agatha said with a helpless shrug. “We dated for a long, long time, and well, it didn’t exactly end happily.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I remember you talking about getting out of a serious relationship,” Wanda said. She walked up slowly to Agatha, and it was suffocating the way she placed her hands on Agatha’s hip. It felt right, but it also felt wrong, and Agatha could only remind herself to breathe. “Why didn’t you just tell me she’d be here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “And risk scaring you off?” Agatha tried to joke.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not getting rid of me that easily,” Wanda replied. She kissed Agatha on the lips then on the cheek. “Do you want to talk about what she said?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “Definitely not.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda hesitated. Her thumb stroked Agatha’s hip as she suggested carefully, “Do you want to leave?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha said, quicker than she intended. It was the truth though. Agatha actually liked seeing her friends here. She didn’t want to leave already. As gently as she could, Agatha pushed Wanda off of her. She tempered the action with a smile. “Let me talk to her and see if we can’t work something out.” The words felt bitter on her tongue, knowing she’d been the one who’d just been goading Rio about being unable to handle a single night together.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure?” Wanda asked. Her face was nothing but concern as she reached out and brushed some of Agatha’s hair from her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled, feeling the urge to squirm away from her touch. She held still. “I’m sure,” she said. She grabbed Wanda’s hand and squeezed it. “I’ll be right back.”
    </p>
<p>
     Without waiting for a reply, Agatha slipped down the hallway to the bathroom she knew Rio would be in. She knocked only once before she let herself. Rio looked up as she entered, scowling when she realized it was her.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want?” Rio snapped. She was dabbing angrily at the neckline of her dress. There was a dark spot where Agatha threw her wine, and it was unclear whether it was from the wine still or water. “Agatha,” Rio said, sharp with warning.
    </p>
<p>
     “I came for a truce,” Agatha said, raising her hands. At Rio’s unimpressed stare, Agatha insisted, “No, really. Maybe we started off on the wrong foot, but there’s no need to ruin the night just because of that, am I right?” Agatha flashed a breezy smile, feeling a deep satisfaction when Rio wavered in her glare. She was always weak when she smiled. “Tonight’s party can be Switzerland,” Agatha offered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Does that mean you’ll hold your tongue?” Rio replied pointedly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eye twitched, but she still nodded and said, “If you will.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Never a straight answer with you,” Rio huffed, only to immediately add, “Don’t make the joke.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re no fun,” Agatha pouted. She joined Rio at the sink, leaning against the counter, while she continued to get the wine out. Finally, Agatha grabbed the towel from her hand and said, “Give me that. You’re hopeless.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried to grab it back, but Agatha held it firmly out of reach. She waited until Rio’s hands fell back to her sides before she ran the towel under water and gently rubbed at Rio’s dress. Without thinking, Agatha slid her hand along Rio’s neck, pulling her closer, so she was at a better angle for Agatha to clean her dress. It wasn’t until she heard Rio’s sharp inhale of breath that she realized just how close they were now.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is this okay?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled wryly. “Sure, like old times.”
    </p>
<p>
     Despite herself, Agatha chuckled. She steadily wiped at the dress, watching as the towel became stained with pink. She worked in silence for a minute or two before Agatha said, “I’m sorry about the dress. Not really sorry about the wine, but I’m sorry if it ruins the dress.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks,” Rio sighed. She shifted her weight, bringing her slightly closer. Her hand rested on the counter, just by Agatha’s hip. “It reminded me of one I used to have.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The one you wore to my mother’s birthday dinner,” Agatha said immediately. When Rio’s head snapped up in surprise, Agatha blushed at how quickly she made the connection. Trying to distract her from the fact, Agatha joked, “Remember how she introduced you to everyone?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Your orphan roommate,” Rio recalled with a laugh. “God, we got so drunk that night. We played a drinking game, didn’t we?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Take a sip every time someone tried to set me up with their son,” Agatha said, laughing too. “Take a sip every time someone said we needed to find a man soon so we could have kids”
    </p>
<p>
     “Take a sip every time your mother caught us flirting or holding hands,” Rio added. Her expression, which had already softened, looked practically affectionate now, all moony eyes and tender smile. It should have made Agatha want to get away, the way Wanda’s had, but it only reminded Agatha of better times. “Then, we found that empty room,” Rio said. Her hand absentmindedly reached and tucked a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear, an unknowing mirror of Wanda. “And we spent the rest of the night there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We sure did,” Agatha murmured. Her hand had slowed down as they spoke, and now, it came to a complete stop, resting against Rio’s chest. Beneath the towel, she felt the rapid pulse of Rio’s heart. Agatha looked up again and found Rio’s eyes on her, but her previous warmth was replaced by something much hotter. She knew this look well too, and she also knew what usually followed this look.
    </p>
<p>
     It almost made her laugh. That was how it always went with them. Fight then fuck. Nothing like a biting argument to work as their foreplay. Apparently, some things never changed.
    </p>
<p>
     Except for the fact that they weren’t together.
    </p>
<p>
     Knowing this didn’t stop Agatha though. It didn’t seem to stop Rio either, who leaned in ever so slightly. Their noses brushed, and Agatha could feel the warmth of Rio’s breath against her lips. They shouldn’t. Wanda was on the other side of the door. Then again, so was Natasha.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the reminder of Natasha, some woman who thought she knew Rio, knew her better than Agatha, is what drove her to tighten her hold on Rio’s neck and pull her into a kiss. They both moaned as their lips met, and neither of them hesitated to deepen the kiss. Agatha’s hand slid into Rio’s hair, pulling on it gently at first then again, harder. Rio repaid her in kind with a harsh bite to her lower lip before she sucked on it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pinned her against the counter, and the marble edge dug uncomfortably into her back, but Agatha barely noticed. All she could focus on was Rio’s lips on hers, biting, licking, and sucking. It was unlike any kiss Agatha had with Wanda. Where Wanda always let Agatha dominate a kiss, Rio never surrendered without a fight. Her nails dug into Agatha’s waist as she pressed her harder into the counter, to the point where it almost hurt.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha slid her hands up Rio’s legs and under her skirt, clutching at the back of her thighs until Rio stumbled into her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Rio moaned.
    </p>
<p>
     Smirking against her lips, Agatha dragged her fingers against Rio’s underwear. Just as she had hoped, the silky fabric was wet already. “You’ve missed me, haven’t you?” Agatha teased. She rubbed her fingers back and forth, and Rio gasped, thrusting into the touch. “She can’t do this to you, can she?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck you,” Rio said, but unlike earlier, this was breathless and needy, whispered against Agatha’s ear. “Fuck you, Agatha. Fuck–” A moan cut off Rio’s words, muffled as Rio buried her face into Agatha’s neck.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s fingers slid along the waistband of Rio’s underwear. She dipped her fingers inside when a sharp knock resounded from the door. Agatha froze. She hadn’t locked the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     At the sound of Wanda’s voice, Agatha yanked her hand away while Rio stumbled away from her, practically running into the wall. The door didn’t open though. Instead, Wanda’s voice continued through the door, “I just wanted to check on you. Jen says dinner is ready.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha licked her lips and said, “We’ll be out in a minute.” She winced at how throaty her voice sounded.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a pause before Wanda asked, “Is everything okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re fine,” Agatha assured her. “Just need to clean up the bathroom a little before Jen has a fit about it later.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I’ll let everyone know.”
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t until Wanda’s footsteps receded that Agatha relaxed. As she turned back to Rio, Agatha ran a hand through her hair, dazed at what just happened. Rio looked just as unsteady, flushed and blinking slowly.
    </p>
<p>
     “That was a mistake,” Agatha said. Saying it aloud made it feel a little more real. What was that thing Billy was always saying? Manifesting. Agatha was speaking it into existence. “I have a girlfriend, and you have a girlfriend–”
    </p>
<p>
     “Natasha isn’t my girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     For the second time in less than five minutes, Agatha felt like the floor had been swept out from beneath her. She stared at Rio, mouth agape, waiting for her to take it back, but Rio jutted her chin out stubbornly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Natasha isn’t my girlfriend,” Rio repeated.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did the only thing she could do at an absolutely insane moment like this.
    </p>
<p>
     She ran.

     Chapter 4
    </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     “Natasha isn’t my girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched a myriad of emotions fly across Agatha’s face. Confusion, anger, joy, pity, victory. Each one was a singular second before it moved on to the next, and before her face could settle on one, Agatha was gone. The bathroom door slammed shut behind her, leaving Rio with her own mess to deal with.
    </p>
<p>
     What was she doing? If Wanda hadn’t knocked on the door, Rio would have let Agatha fucked her without a second thought. If that had happened, then what? Most likely, the same exact thing would have happened. Agatha would have made excuses and ran, just like she always did. Really, Rio should have known better.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a few more minutes to pull herself together and freshen up. The least she could do before heading back out there was not look like she was just five seconds from having sex. Rio looked at herself in the mirror and took a deep breath. This was going to be fine.
    </p>
<p>
     Except, it really wasn’t fine. Rio walked back into the living room, only for bile to immediately rise in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     On the couch, like she didn’t just have her tongue down her throat and her hand in her panties, Agatha sat curled around Wanda. Her arm was wrapped around her, fingers toying with the end of long, red strands, and her other hand held Wanda’s in her lap. Her smile was warm as she pressed her face to the side of Wanda’s face. She looked happy. Sickeningly so.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was going to throw up.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a lie, of course. Someone who was actually happy didn’t go around fucking their ex in the bathroom. Agatha could put on a mask better than anyone else, and Rio was reminded of that right now.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio slowly made her way into the living room on unsteady legs, Agatha glanced at her. Their eyes only met for a split second, but Rio still felt it like a jolt of electricity to her system. Ignoring the feeling, she made her way to Natasha. She pressed up against her from behind, wrapping her arms around her and resting her hands on her stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     “You okay?” Natasha asked cautiously. She was stiff in Rio’s arms. She’d told her ahead of time that she was fine with any PDA Rio wanted, but Rio had told her she probably wouldn’t do much. That was before everything that had just happened though. Natasha scanned her face then relaxed into her hold. She kissed her cheek and asked in a quieter voice, “Do I want to know what happened in the bathroom?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope,” Rio said. She rested her chin on Natasha’s shoulder and looked everywhere but Agatha. She watched Jennifer and Alice talk and Lilia look at something on Billy’s phone. That was all she saw, all she needed to see.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, good, you’re back,” Jennifer said, noticing Rio. She raised a brow at her clinging to Natasha, but she continued, “Let’s eat.”
    </p>
<p>
     Everyone made their way to the table Jennifer set up, settling around it. Despite her best efforts, Rio ended up sitting across from Agatha, and really, who let that happen? Swallowing her discomfort, Rio complimented Jennifer on the spread of food and started eating.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, Agatha,” Jennifer said after a while, “what have you been up to?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really, Jen?” Agatha snorted.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you mean ‘really’?” Jennifer huffed. “I’m not allowed to ask what you’ve been doing the last year?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly,” Agatha said sweetly, and Rio couldn’t quite hold back her snort. Agatha’s eyes flicked to her, appreciative for just a moment, before she looked away again. “What is there to say, really? Got a new place, new neighbors.” She jabbed a thumb at Billy and continued, “None of them are nearly as annoying as this one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” Billy protested. “You love me.” Agatha made a face, doing a so-so motion with her hand that made everyone else laugh. “Oh, please. You really want to act like that? You literally baked me a birthday cake when I was ten, and it was the worst cake I’ve ever had, but you made it.” Agatha shook her head furiously, but Billy turned to Rio and said, “Didn’t she?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, who’d just been about to shove a forkful of mashed potatoes into her mouth, paused. It felt weird to think about old times right now, but she clearly remembered what Billy was talking about.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio and Agatha had been together three years at the point, living next to Billy for one. Although they’d initially been worried about living in the suburbs, the Kaplans had been nothing but kind and welcoming. While Rio got along with Rebecca and Jeff, Agatha often played with Billy. It just worked out that way, and more than once, Rio had considered asking Agatha about having kids. She’d never gotten the courage to though.
    </p>
<p>
     For Billy’s tenth birthday, Rebecca was out of town, visiting a sick relative, and the little boy had been devastated. As brave as he tried to be, anyone could see he was moping over the fact that his mom wasn’t home. Jeff tried to cheer him up, but he wasn’t much of a baker, and the one thing Billy wanted more than anything else was the chocolate cake Rebecca always made for his birthday.
    </p>
<p>
     So, Agatha, the wonderful, stubborn woman that she was, got it into her head that she’d bake the cake for Billy. Never mind the fact that Agatha could barely cook, let alone bake. Rio had been at work when Agatha made this decision, or else she would have stopped her. Alone though, Agatha was free to try her hand at baking, and it was only when it was too late and time to give Billy the cake that Rio came home.
    </p>
<p>
     The cake had been dry and salty, and the frosting had been too sweet. They all tried to politely eat a slice before Agatha threw down her fork and said, “This tastes like shit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff hadn’t even scolded Agatha for cursing in front of Billy, more relieved by the fact that he wouldn’t have to eat the cake.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been an awful cake, truly, but it had cheered Billy up, and when they got home that night, Agatha had frosting on her hands and face, and Rio had taken her time licking it off of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head, as if that could clear the memories from her head. “Yeah,” she said, just a touch unsteady. Forcing a smile, Rio nodded at Billy and said, “Agatha’s always had a soft spot for the kid. Cake was shit though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Softie,” Wanda said, giving Agatha an adoring smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hand tightened around her fork until Natasha laid her hand on top, giving her a warning look. With her lips pressed into a thin line, Rio carefully let go of the fork and set it down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio’s always had a soft spot too,” Agatha blurted out, and Rio wondered if she was the only one who saw it for what it was. An excuse to get the attention off of her and her vulnerability. “Used to take Billy to the park all the time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Billy nodded enthusiastically. He mainly addressed Natasha as he said, “On her days off, she’d take me. I think she was bored because Agatha wasn’t home.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” Rio said, feeling her cheeks heat up.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy just grinned and continued, “We’d run around the field for hours. Sometimes, we’d pretend we were wizards or pirates or anything, really, and then when I got older, she helped me with basketball and baseball.” He scrunched up his face and said, “Well, she tried to help me. I’m hopeless at sports.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was nothing,” Rio said. She picked her fork back up, so she had something to toy with. “It was either take you to the park, or you’d just bother me at home. At least at the park we could do something that would tire you out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You aren’t fooling anyone,” Alice informed her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes, but she caught Agatha staring at her in a way she hadn’t all night. Softly, almost loving. Rio bit her lip and dropped her eyes back down to her food.
    </p>
<p>
     “You moved too, didn’t you?” Lilia asked, even though they all knew Rio had moved. Lilia had actually been the one to play tiebreaker on who got to keep some of the things. “How’s your place?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried hard not to sigh. She should have seen this coming. They were all probably wondering how she was doing after the break-up. All Rio had done was send them the occasional text to let them know she was alive. Deciding on a safe topic, Rio answered, “The commute from my new place is starting to be a real pain.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, you might not have to worry about that for long,” Natasha said, only to realize what she’d just said. Her green eyes jumped to Rio’s, apologetic already. “Oops,” she murmured as another uneasy silence developed.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s that supposed to mean?” It was Agatha who asked, voice deceptively casual. She smiled expectantly, but it wasn’t just her.
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, everyone was looking at Rio, and all Rio wanted was to sink into the earth and maybe never come back out. That was usually frowned upon though, so Rio cleared her throat awkwardly and said, “My job offered me a transfer,” she explained, eyes fixed to her plate. “I’d leave New York for London in the summer, if I accept it.”
    </p>
<p>
     There was a beat of silence before Jennifer exclaimed, “London, wow!” Although she tried, you could still hear her distaste for the news.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged, dragging her fork through her food.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, is it a move for forever?” Alice asked. Always the kindest, she sounded genuinely interested, even if she did also sound a little sad.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, until they need me somewhere else,” Rio said. She smiled half-heartedly and said, “Guess that’s what I get for being good at my job.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you love New York,” Agatha said. It was thrown out like an accusation, and it made Rio bristle.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, well, New York doesn’t hold the same charm it used to,” Rio retorted. She looked right at Agatha as she said, “Nothing's keeping me here anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     The only sound was the scrape of metal on ceramic for a few seconds. Then, Agatha said, voice shaking with an unreadable emotion, “So, you never wanted to stay, is that it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Lilia said warningly.
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, she wasn’t all that hungry anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     “Excuse me,” Rio mumbled, standing. The chair scraped against the floor, a harsh and grating noise. Rio would have to apologize to Jennifer for that later. “I’m full. I’m going to get some air.”
    </p>
<p>
     Without waiting for a response, she headed for the front door, ignoring the eyes on her as she fled.

<p>
     The rest of dinner ended in stilted small talk, mostly the others asking Wanda and Natasha about themselves.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha barely listened. She ate mechanically, not tasting a single bite that went into her mouth. All she could think about was the fact that Rio might be moving. If she did move, it wasn’t even to another borough or even another state. Rio would be moving across the world, and even though Agatha knew that shouldn’t matter to her anymore, she couldn’t stand the idea.
    </p>
<p>
     When her plate seemed sufficiently empty, Agatha excused herself. To her right, Billy eyed her knowingly and said, “Don’t say anything stupid. We still have presents.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha slapped him upside the head and replied, “I’m not taking advice from you. Eat your green beans.” Then, she turned to Wanda and squeezed her shoulder. “I’ll be right back,” she told her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Need back up?” Wanda offered.
    </p>
<p>
     That would be disastrous. Agatha smiled weakly and said, “No, I’m good. You just enjoy yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Should I be worried?” Wanda said, and Agatha didn’t have a good answer for that. Instead, she kissed her lightly and gave her another smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grabbed her coat and slipped out the front door. Just as she expected, Rio was right there, sitting on the front steps, cigarette in hand. Sighing, Agatha plopped down next to her. A moment later, she was offered a cigarette. Wanda hated cigarettes, always telling her they smelled and they would end up killing her. Agatha took the cigarette.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio handed her a lighter too, and Agatha lit it with ease. Her eyes fell shut for a moment, and when she opened them again, Rio was staring at her. Her dark eyes, always captivating, felt unfathomable in the dim moonlight. Agatha wondered what she was thinking right now.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, London,” Agatha said after a few minutes. “Are you really going to move?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe,” Rio shrugged. “Like I said, nothing keeping me here now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s jaw clenched. She took a long drag from her cigarette, trying to temper the fury building inside of her. “And like I said, did you really never want to stay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, Agatha,” Rio said, shaking her head. “I just would have liked the option.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I didn’t give you the option?” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her a dark look before she put her cigarette to her lips. Smoke slowly trailed from her lips, and Agatha thought about another time where she’d kiss her before it could all escape. She thought of harsh, messy kisses and youth. God, when had they gotten so old?
    </p>
<p>
     “You never wanted anything to change,” Rio said softly. “I liked that for a lot of reasons, but you know that I didn’t agree with all of it.” She leaned back on one hand, head tilted back to look at the moon. She looked beautiful like this. “I passed up on a lot of job opportunities for you, and you might not have asked me to do that, but you also never asked me what I wanted or tried to compromise me either.” Rio let out a puff of smoke and smiled, a bitter little thing. “You couldn’t compromise with me on marriage either.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nearly dropped her cigarette. It was true. Eight years, that was how long they’d been together. Every so often, Rio brought up the idea of marriage, and Agatha knew she’d also thought about kids too. Rio had always wanted a family, and Agatha… Agatha had always been afraid of having a family. She thought if they got married, everything else would follow, and then she’d ruin it. Inevitably, she would ruin it. Evanora had made sure of that.
    </p>
<p>
     The cigarette fell from Agatha’s hand, and she stared at it for a long moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, you’re leaving,” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     Infuriatingly, Rio shrugged. “Maybe.” She finished her cigarette and crushed the rest under her foot. She stood up and brushed off her dress. “Not that it should matter to you anymore,” Rio added under her breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “I still care,” Agatha found herself saying.
    </p>
<p>
     “And why do you?” Rio said. “You brought another woman here tonight, Agatha, and unlike me, you seem to actually be dating her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pressed her lips together. She was right. She shouldn’t care at all. They were broken up, and Agatha remembered how angry she’d been, spitting at Rio,
     <em>
      “Fuck you! Walk into the street, get hit by a car! See if I care!”
     </em>
     The irony that she so desperately did care made Agatha burn with shame.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s what I thought,” Rio sighed. She started to say something then seemed to think better of it. “Come on. They’re going to want to start presents soon.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha begrudgingly followed her back inside, but they barely made it two steps in when Billy was there, wide-eyed and a tad frenzied, shouting, “Look! Mistletoe!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio startled, looking up, and sure enough, there was mistletoe hanging right above them. Agatha was pretty damn sure that hadn’t been there earlier. They looked at each other speechlessly while Billy said, “You have to kiss now.”
    </p>
<p>
     There was something about the way he said it that made Agatha look at him again. It was impossible to miss the smugness about him. This was the look of a kid whose plan worked out perfectly. The little shit. Agatha was going to kill him.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked around for Wanda, and Alice, just behind Billy, caught her eye. With a sympathetic look, she mouthed to her, “Bathroom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Of course, Agatha’s one excuse not to do this was conveniently in the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean, it is tradition,” Jennifer said, joining the small crowd forming by her front door. She looked far too amused by this, as did Natasha, who stood beside her. Even if she wasn’t actually Rio’s girlfriend, should she really find this so funny? “Go on,” Jennifer said. “For old time’s sake.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Old time’s sake?” Agatha repeated incredulously while Rio sighed, “Guys.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just do it,” Lilia told them, “so we can open presents. You know they aren’t going to let you go until you do this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha considered just marching right back out the door, but she couldn’t exactly leave Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     Reluctantly, Agatha turned to Rio. In a move that still felt too natural after their break-up, Agatha cupped Rio’s face and kissed her. It was a soft peck, and that was all Agatha intended to do, but then Rio was right there. All she could think about was the way Rio had responded to her touch earlier, and Agatha knew she needed to feel it again.
    </p>
<p>
     Their second kiss was far less innocent, nothing you could play off as following a stupid Christmas tradition, but Agatha didn’t care. Rio tasted of smoke and spice, and Agatha had never tasted something so addictive. One more kiss turned into far more than that as Agatha lost herself in Rio, sinking into her familiarity.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was jerked backwards. With a yelp, she stumbled back into Jennifer, who’d been the one to pull her away. She glared at her as she absent-mindedly wiped at her lips, but Jennifer just glared back unapologetically.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re welcome,” Jennifer said to her quietly. A second later, Jennifer looked away from her and said, “Wanda, there you are! Now, we can finally do presents.”
    </p>
<p>
     With more purpose this time, Agatha rubbed at her lips as subtly as she could, praying that Rio’s lipstick wasn’t on her.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda didn’t seem to notice anything was strange though. She merely linked her arm with Agatha’s with her and said, “I hope you’re excited. I know we said no presents, but I got you something small.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew she wasn’t exactly the best person around, but she really felt like a piece of shit when she heard that. “Thanks,” she said sincerely. She kissed Wanda’s cheek and tried not to feel sick.
    </p>
<p>
     As they walked back to the living room, Agatha chanced a glance over her shoulder. Rio stared back, and Agatha looked away quickly. The night was almost over. She could handle this.
    </p>
<p>
     No more kissing her ex.
    </p>
<p>
     It was that simple.
    </p>
<p>
     Right?

<p>
     If there was one thing Rio shamelessly loved about Christmas, it was getting to give gifts.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t care less if she got presents herself. There was just something satisfying about finding the perfect gift for someone, things that they wouldn’t have thought of themselves but loved nonetheless.
    </p>
<p>
     Usually, Rio would be at the edge of her seat, watching others open the gifts she got them, but right now, Rio was tucked away in an armchair, trying not to pass out.
    </p>
<p>
     Almost getting fucked by her ex? That was enough to send Rio into a spiral. Kissing her ex under the mistletoe in front of all of their friends? Rio was amazed by the fact that she wasn’t hyperventilating. As it was, she was carefully staring off into space, not processing a single thing going on around her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio only snapped out of it when Billy all but launched himself at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” Billy said, his words slurring together in his excitement. He pulled back, eyes bright. His smile was the biggest Rio had ever seen. In his hands were the rare editions of some comic books Rio had given him. Billy had always been a nerd, and honestly, he’d always been the easiest person to shop for. “How did you even find these?” Billy asked breathlessly.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a secret,” Rio winked, and Billy laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Aren’t you full of surprises,” Natasha said from beside her on the floor. She held up the fuzzy sweater with unbridled glee. As tough as she acted, Rio quickly realized Natasha was a real sucker for anything soft. “I’m going to wear this all the time now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “If you really like it that much, I can tell you where I bought it,” Rio offered.
    </p>
<p>
     Natasha rolled her eyes. “It’s not fun if I buy it myself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled and watched as everyone else opened their gifts. From Rio, Alice got a book on musical theory, Jennifer got a certificate to one of the nicer spas in the city, and Lilia got a gold bracelet with colorful gems dangling from it. Finally, Rio’s eyes finally landed on Agatha. She’d debated long and hard about whether to get her anything, and ultimately, she decided not to. Mainly, she hadn’t because she had no idea what to get her without it feeling too serious.
    </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, Agatha was opening what looked like a gift from Wanda. It was beautifully wrapped in scarlet red wrapping paper. Agatha eventually lifted the item from the box, and Rio saw the flash of uncertainty cross her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s nothing special,” Wanda said shyly. “I just noticed your scarf was getting a little worn out.”
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, Rio understood Agatha’s reaction. Everyone quieted at this, but no one offered an explanation. How could they when they all knew how awkward it would be?
    </p>
<p>
     The scarf Wanda was referring to was one Rio had made for Agatha four years ago. After some poor decisions after one too many shots of tequila, Rio had broken her ankle and was relegated to their bed. Bored immediately, Rio had looked for something to fill her time and somehow landed on knitting. This ended up being a miserable decision because Rio ended up being goddamn awful at knitting. Tapped in bed though, she was determined to finish one thing. By the time Rio had gotten her cast off, she had made one scarf. It was dark purple, a little wonky, and it had been promptly gifted to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn’t worn another scarf since.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s,” Agatha stopped, seeming to be at a loss for words. “It’s,” she tried again, eyebrows furrowed. “It’s, um, it’s–”
    </p>
<p>
     “That looks so soft!” Billy jumped in. “Let me feel. Wow! This feels expensive. Where’d you find this, Wanda? Do they have it in blue?”
    </p>
<p>
     For once, Rio was thankful for Billy’s chatty ways. She watched for a moment as he distracted Wanda with a thousand questions before she found herself meeting Agatha’s gaze. She wasn’t prepared by the wistfulness in it. For the first time tonight, Rio felt like she and Agatha were on the same page. A similar loss, a similar longing. A wish that they could be like they used to be, remembering a happier, easier time.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio managed a small smile before she looked away, accepting a small box Natasha handed her. “What’s this?” she asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Natasha shrugged, “I don’t know. It just has your name on it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Frowning, Rio untied the ribbon and opened the box. A jewelry box, she soon realized. Her heart stopped for a second as she stared down at the necklace nestled inside. It was a dainty charm of obsidian in the shape of a teardrop. It wasn’t a heart, but Rio knew what it meant anyways.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let out a shaky breath and found Agatha’s eyes already on her.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is it?” Natasha asked, peering at the box. “That’s pretty. Suits you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Rio said, voice barely above a whisper. She glanced at Agatha again. “It’s, uh, it’s beautiful.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What is it?” Alice asked, leaning over to look. “That’s gorgeous. Who got that for you?” Before she could stop herself, Rio looked at Agatha again. Alice followed her gaze and let out a quiet, “Oh.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a joke,” Rio explained. “I used to say my heart is black, but it beats for Agatha.” Her chest felt tight as she stared at the pendant. “It was stupid,” she muttered.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice glanced between Rio and Agatha. With a little nod to herself, she seemed to have decided something. “You should wear it,” Alice said firmly. “Want me to put it on for you?” She didn’t wait for an answer. She grabbed the box from Rio and stood up, stepping behind her. Rio tried to protest, but Alice just said, “Shhh. I’m helping you out here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Helping her how? Rio shrank into the chair as everyone noticed what Alice was doing. This was not very helpful at all.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s that?” Wanda asked politely.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio closed her fist around the pendant, feeling oddly protective of it. It was just a silly inside joke, but it had been theirs. She was still trying to figure out what to say when Agatha spoke up, “A necklace. An old one I found lying around. It got mixed up in my things, so I figured I’d give it to her.”
    </p>
<p>
     A lie, Rio was sure of it. She certainly hadn’t owned anything like this when they were together, but maybe Agatha really had just found it recently. Regardless, she didn’t feel like calling her out on it. Their kiss still played in her head, taunting her. Instead, Rio said, keeping her tone flippant, “Well, thanks for passing it along. I guess it’ll match some of my outfits.” More like all of her outfits.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought it was a pretty convincing lie, but Wanda looked between Agatha and Rio with a frown. It was only a matter of time, Rio supposed. They hadn’t acted normally all night, and anyone would want to know exactly what was going on between them, especially if they were dating one of them.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda leaned over and whispered something in Agatha’s ear. The slight smile on Agatha’s dropped off her face immediately, replaced by a resigned dread. With a small nod, she took Wanda’s hand, and the two of them stepped into the hallway, out of sight. That was not a conversation Rio envied at all.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you think they’ll break up?” Natasha asked. It looked like she wasn’t the only one who noticed. Natasha rested her chin on Rio’s knee and smirked. “I think they’ll break up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe,” Rio said. She rolled the pendant between her fingers, and she knew this was going to become a habit of hers. A small piece of Agatha, right by her heart. It was not going to help her move on at all, but Rio didn’t care. “Agatha is kind of a mess, but she’s always been a mess. You can’t really date her without knowing that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t really want to think about what was happening between them. She started to clean up the wrapping paper surrounding her, but she didn’t get very far when Billy slapped the trash out of her hand. She glared at him, but he smiled unapologetically back.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think they’ll break up,” Billy whispered, sitting down on the arm of Rio’s chair. “She doesn’t like her, not like how she likes you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed and fought back the urge to push him onto the floor. She settled for hitting him upside the head. “Kid, you don’t know what you’re talking about,” Rio said. “This isn’t going to be some fairy tale, happy ending.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m just saying,” Billy said, nodding at the hallway. “I’ve talked to Wanda a lot tonight. I don’t think she gets Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Give her eight years,” Rio replied dryly. “She’ll get there.”
    </p>
<p>
     Before Billy could argue more, Jennifer joined them and said, “As riveting as this is, I need Rio.” She grabbed Rio’s arm and pulled her to her feet with more strength than she expected. “Remember that box of books you asked to leave here when you first moved? I need you to come grab them before you forget them. They’re a real eyesore in my office.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right now?” Rio complained. She dug her heels in. “Agatha and Wanda are probably fighting right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Consider it a bonus,” Jennifer replied. “We can interrupt them before they break something.” She gave Rio a look. “Oh wait. That was you two.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Once,” Rio said. “We broke a vase once.” It hadn’t even been a fight. They’d been kissing, and Rio’s elbow knocked over the vase.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let her drag her into the hall, but as soon as they turned the corner, they both came to an abrupt stop. Rio guessed that they’d be fighting, angry whispers and pointing fingers. How wrong she was.
    </p>
<p>
     It turned out seeing her ex making out with her new girlfriend was going to be her breaking point.

    </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     Agatha can admit it was really stupid to give Rio the necklace.
    </p>
<p>
     She had to get rid of the thing though. She’d found it a few months ago, but not because it’d gotten mixed up in her things. Agatha had just never gotten the chance to give it to her. It was supposed to be a birthday gift for Rio, but then the break-up happened. Since she found it, the stupid necklace had sat on her dresser, taunting her every time her eyes landed on it.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t supposed to mean anything. Agatha really had just wanted to get the thing out of her apartment. It wasn’t supposed to mean anything, but Agatha couldn’t deny the way her breath had caught when she saw Alice putting it on Rio. It looked as pretty as Agatha imagined.
    </p>
<p>
     Of course, Agatha wasn’t the only one to notice the sickeningly sentimental gift, so when Wanda asked if they could talk, Agatha had no choice but to agree. A part of her felt guilty, having invited her to this shit show, but another part of her wanted to shrug it off. They weren’t that serious anyways.
    </p>
<p>
     They walked a little ways down the hall, just enough that they could speak without being heard from the living room. Wanda turned to her, hands on her hips, and Agatha grimaced. That was a pose that she was familiar with, and it never meant anything good, at least not on any woman Agatha had dated.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well?” Wanda said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well what?” Agatha shot back. Wanda’s tone grated on her, scolding like a teacher who found a student breaking the rules. She shoved her hands into her pockets and tried not to let her scowl take over.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have been trying to be understanding,” Wanda said. She took a deep breath, but Agatha could see just how tense she was. “You didn’t want to tell me about your ex? Fine. You want to act like a child around your ex? Less fine. But, Agatha, a necklace, really?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It doesn’t mean anything,” Agatha said, but the words sounded hollow even to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t act like anything about tonight has been okay,” Wanda said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda–”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda waved her hands, cutting her off. She crossed her arms over her chest and glared at her. Agatha gritted her teeth. Wanda said, “No, just tell me. Do you still love her?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha considered the question. It was hard to say. It wasn’t something she let herself dwell on these days. “It’s complicated,” she said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course it’s complicated!” Wanda scoffed. “You can never give a straight answer, can you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Despite everything, Agatha couldn’t help but recall Rio saying something similar in the bathroom. The difference was Rio had known her well enough to stop the joke before Agatha could even make it. It wasn’t a fair comparison, Agatha knew. Rio knew her for almost a decade. Wanda barely knew her for three months. Sighing, Agatha “I can’t just turn these feelings off, but Wanda, I do like you. I swear I do.” She didn’t know why she was even trying to salvage this. Maybe because it felt like losing to let her go, and Agatha always did hate losing. Maybe because it was easier to deal with Wanda than everything going on with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Agatha stepped toward Wanda. When she didn’t move away, Agatha wrapped her arms around her and pulled her close. “I’m sorry,” Agatha said. Was she actually? Agatha wasn’t sure. She knew she should regret kissing Rio. She should believe it was a mistake like she said. None of it had felt wrong though, not if she ignored the fact that she was dating Wanda. Agatha was dating Wanda though, and she knew an apology was what Wanda wanted to hear.
    </p>
<p>
     Just as Agatha expected, Wanda softened. She rested her forehead against Agatha’s. “I’m no one’s second choice,” Wanda whispered, and despite how quietly she said it, Agatha could hear the steel in her words.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course not,” Agatha murmured.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed her, gently at first then fiercely. If there was one thing Agatha was good at, it was distracting a woman like this. She swallowed the quiet whimpers that left Wanda and backed them up until she was pressed between Agatha and the wall. It was different kissing Wanda now. Rio crept into her mind, the bite of her kisses, the sting of her nails. None of it was like the soft kisses Wanda traded with her right now.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn’t sure how long they stood there, kissing, but the next thing she was aware of was Jennifer saying, “Fuck.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha broke away from Wanda, finding Jennifer and Rio standing at the end of the hall. Jennifer looked shocked, but Rio looked furious. Agatha instinctively took a step away from Wanda as Rio stormed up to them. Jennifer hurried after her, a hand on her shoulder. Even with that though, she couldn’t stop Rio from slapping Agatha across the face.
    </p>
<p>
     It hurt more than she expected, and Agatha worked her jaw for a moment. “Can I help you?” Agatha asked sarcastically.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve got to be kidding me,” Rio laughed, but it was a harsh, unforgiving sound. When Agatha and Wanda could only stare at her, she tilted her head and waved her hands. “No, go on,” she sneered. “Don’t let us interrupt.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What is your problem?” Wanda snapped, taking a step forward.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t,” Agatha said. She grabbed her arm to hold her back. Her eyes flicked between the two women. Rio had always been the kind of woman to wear her emotions for everyone to see, and tonight was no exception. “Rio, let it go,” Agatha told her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let what go?” Rio countered. “What happened earlier?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha flinched, causing Wanda to ask, “What do you mean?” A look of realization dawned on her face. She ripped her arm away from Agatha. “Tell me,” Wanda demanded. “What happened earlier? What is she talking about?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s wrong, Agatha?” Rio asked with mock sympathy. “Afraid she’ll find out exactly what a liar you are?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t pull that liar shit with me,” Agatha snarled. “You’re the one who lied to everyone that Natasha is your girlfriend, and for what?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer gasped, but Rio ignored her. She shook her head and shouted, “God, how fucking dense are you? It was to make you jealous! I wanted to show I was over you even though I’m not.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agahta couldn’t help but feel a flash of delight. “You regret it, don’t you?” Agatha taunted. “Leaving me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You left me first!” Rio shouted. Her voice broke, and Agatha realized there were tears in her eyes. “You can stop playing dumb, Agatha, okay? I know. I know you saw the IVF brochure. I know you saw it, and you freaked, and you wanted to run. You were pulling away from me for weeks before I found it in one of your drawers.” Rio heaved a shuddering breath as a few tears spilled onto her cheeks. “I ended it because you wouldn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s mouth fell open. That was what this was all about?
    </p>
<p>
     Vividly, Agatha remembered the IVF brochure Rio was talking about. It had been about two months before the break-up when Agatha found it under the bed while cleaning. Agatha hadn’t even considered confronting Rio about it. She shoved it into the back of one of her drawers, even as the fear and anxiety of raising a child ate at her. Did Rio want a child? Did Rio really trust her with a child? What if having a child with her made Rio realize just how fucked up she was?
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, it all became clear to her. Staying later and later at work, sharing less and less, pulling away the moment she decided sex was over. She hadn’t even realized it, but Rio was right. She had been pulling away the moment she found that brochure, and she hadn’t even realized it because she forced herself to forget about it. If Agatha didn’t bring it up and neither did Rio, they could pretend everything was fine.
    </p>
<p>
     It hadn’t been fine though.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha found herself at a loss for words. “Rio, I…”
    </p>
<p>
     An uneasy silence fell over them, and it was only then that Agatha noticed everyone else at the entrance to the hallway, hovering awkwardly.
    </p>
<p>
     After a tense minute, Wanda cleared her throat, looking as drained as Agatha felt. “I’m going to go,” Wanda said. She smiled humorlessly. “I think it goes without saying that I don’t want to see you again, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     As Wanda grabbed her coat, Natasha laid a hand on her arm and asked, “Hey, need a ride home?” Wanda hesitated, and they both looked at Rio, almost as if to ask for permission. Rio, pale and withdrawn, gave a weak wave. Natasha hesitated. When Rio just shook her head, Natasha mouthed something Agatha didn’t catch then left with Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re just going to…” Jennifer didn’t finish her sentence. She just walked back to her living room, taking Alice, Lilia, and Billy with her.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, it was only them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t know what to say. She didn’t want to say anything. There was a reason she’d buried all of this so deeply.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think it’s time we talk,” Rio finally said. Her voice was gravely and quiet, and a part of Agatha wanted to take her into her arms at the sound of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t though. She merely followed Rio out the door to talk about all of this once and for all.

<div>
<p>
     For the second time tonight, Rio found herself on the steps of Jennifer’s townhouse with a cigarette between her lips. Agatha sat a foot away from her, just as she had before, but this time, she’d rejected the cigarette.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t think much of it. The only reason she was having another was to give her something to do. The thought of trying to have this conversation, just sitting there, filled Rio with a kind of antsy dread that wouldn’t have ended well for anyone.
    </p>
<p>
     They’d been sitting like this for a while now, but Rio didn’t know how to start this conversation. She didn’t want to start this conversation, which is why the whole break-up happened in the first place. She didn’t want to hear whatever excuses Agatha gave her, or worse, whatever horrible truths she might say.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t mean to bring it up like that,” Rio finally said. It was the truth. The last thing Rio would have ever wanted to do was put Agatha on the spot like that about having kids, especially in front of everyone. It’d all just been too much. Tonight had been too much. Rio sighed and rubbed her forehead. “Sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry too,” Agatha replied. She had her head bowed as she stared at her hands. They were clasped together so tightly that her knuckles had gone white. “For… everything, I guess.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded slowly as she tried to organize her thoughts. Might as well start from the beginning, she supposed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought I was imagining things at first,” Rio told her quietly. She felt her throat close up at the memories coming back to her. Those awful weeks where she’d never felt more alone. “I told myself I was just being clingy for some reason,” Rio laughed bitterly. “Everything was fine. Why would anything be wrong?” She fiddled with her cigarette and let the smoke comfort her. It was easier to focus on that instead of her tears. “I kept telling myself that, but somewhere, in the back of my mind, I knew that something was wrong. I just couldn’t figure out what.” Rio finished the last of her cigarette and crushed it under her foot. She was tempted to pull out another. It was just one of those days.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then, one day,” Rio continued, “I was looking for something. I don’t even know what now, but I was looking through your drawers, and that’s where I found the IVF brochure. That’s when everything made sense. I knew you put it there because you didn’t want to talk about it, but I guess that made me realize that you didn’t trust me to talk about it.” That had been the hardest part of it all. Not that Agatha didn’t want to have kids, but that she hadn’t felt like she could talk to Rio about it at all.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. She rested her head against the railing and turned it to look at her. “Rio, it wasn’t you,” she said. She caught Rio’s eyeroll and said, “Shut up. I know how stupid that sounds, but it wasn’t.” Agatha bit her lip, and Rio remembered the way she’d always chew on it when she was thinking hard about something. “I can’t risk being my mother,” Agatha confessed, barely above a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     “You wouldn’t be,” Rio said immediately.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t know that,” Agatha argued. “All I know is an emotionally abusive mother. What the hell would I do with a kid?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I have such shining examples of parenting?” Rio replied. She hadn’t spoken to her own parents since she was eighteen. “It’s more than that, isn’t it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What if you realized I wasn’t who you thought I was?” Agatha blurted out, and Rio was surprised to see the genuine fear in her eyes. “What if you realized you didn’t want me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed incredulously, “Are you kidding?” She shook her head and said, “Eight years, Agatha. Eight years we were together.” She reached out and grabbed her hand, tangling their fingers together. “I know you, and trust me when I say I’ve seen the worst of you.” Rio flashed a crooked smile. “You know, like the last year.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Try the last four hours,” Agatha snorted.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed again, but this time, it was genuine. She tugged on her hand until Agatha got the cue and moved closer to her. Their sides pressed together, and Rio let out a shaky breath. This was different from kissing or fucking. This was just simple intimacy, and in some ways, Rio missed this most.
    </p>
<p>
     Just like before, a silence settled over them, but Rio didn’t mind it as much now. There was a certain comfort to being with Agatha like this. Eight years, like she said, was a long time to know someone. Being Agatha felt as natural as breathing. Maybe that was it. Rio felt her chest loosen, like she could finally breathe again.
    </p>
<p>
     They couldn’t stay like this forever though, as much as Rio wanted to. “So now what?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Agatha murmured. At some point, she’d flipped their hands and started tracing the veins on the back of Rio’s hands, again and again, as if they might lead her to an answer.
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean, we could start dating again,” Rio said casually, as if the mere thought didn’t make her stomach do flips, “but that just might blow up in our faces again. We have a lot of issues that we need to work through.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay,” Agatha said wryly. “You can say it’s me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Without missing a beat, Rio said, “You have a lot of issues.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t have to say that quickly,” Agatha said, but it was said with fond exasperation and a squeeze to her hand. She took a deep breath. “Do you really want to date me again?” Agatha asked quietly.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve missed you,” Rio said simply. It was easier to say that than to explain the mess of emotions going on in her head. She wasn’t really sure if this was the best choice, but it was what she wanted. Rio had seen what her life was like without Agatha, and she hadn’t liked it at all.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t promise you anything,” Agatha began.
    </p>
<p>
     “Excellent start,” Rio quipped.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pinched her side and said, “Are you going to let me talk?” She waited until Rio mimed zipping her lips. Agatha went back to tracing Rio’s veins, her eyes focused on them. “I can’t promise you a perfect marriage or happy family, but I can promise you… Well, me.” She looked up now, meeting Rio’s gaze. She looked more vulnerable than Rio remembered her being in a long time. “Me and my issues and my trying to make this work this time. Talking instead of running.”
    </p>
<p>
     Smiling softly, Rio reached out and tucked a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear. “Keep that up and a girl might get some ideas,” Rio said, a gentle tease.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah?” Agatha’s smile was small but hopeful, and Rio wanted to kiss her so badly. So she did.
    </p>
<p>
     This kiss was different from the desperate, frenzied one in the bathroom or the hesitant, longing one under the mistletoe. Their kiss was tender and slow, a promise. Rio pulled back but rested her forehead against Agatha’s, embarrassed by how fast her heart was beating after such a chaste kiss. It had felt different though. It reminded Rio of kisses from over a year ago.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you for my necklace,” Rio whispered. She grinned when Agatha blushed, ducking her head slightly. She kissed Agatha’s forehead and said, “Merry Christmas, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked, tilting her head back up to look at her. “It’s not Christmas yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?” Rio said, faking surprise. “But I have my gift already.” She wrapped an arm around Agatha, making it clear what she meant.
    </p>
<p>
     “God, you’re so cheesy,” Agatha groaned, but she was grinning as Rio pulled her into another kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     Things weren’t fixed, and this certainly wasn’t some happily ever after, but it was something. It was a start.
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio wouldn’t let her go this time.

      It was a wordless agreement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When the party ended, they each got into their cars, and thirty minutes later, they were stumbling into Agatha’s apartment, kissing frantically. As soon as the door shut, Rio found herself pressed against it with Agatha kneeling between her legs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha,” Rio gasped.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “God, I love how you say my name,” Agatha said as she pushed up the skirt of her dress. She dragged her tongue over her covered center and groaned. “I’ve been thinking about this since the bathroom. Haven’t you?” Impatient, she didn’t even bother tugging the underwear off. She merely pulled it aside before she placed an open-mouthed kiss against her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tangled her hands in Agatha’s hair, biting down hard on her lower lip, as Agatha buried her face between her thighs. Her eyes slammed shut as Agatha licked her again and again, switching between fast and slow, until Rio’s back was arched off the door and her hips were pressing into her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Just as Rio was about to come, Agatha pulled away. Rio whined, trying to wrestle her back against her, but Agatha resisted. She finally pulled off Rio’s underwear and tossed it to the side. With a chuckle, she climbed back onto her feet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When she kissed her, Rio couldn’t help but moan as she tasted herself on Agatha’s tongue. It had been over a year since she’d had sex, and god, she’d missed it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha dug her nails into Rio’s thigh before she lifted her leg, wrapping it around her waist. Not a moment later, she pushed two fingers into Rio, making her cry out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, please,” Rio said. She matched the brutal pace Agatha set with her hips, chasing the building pleasure inside of her. She slammed her head against the door with a loud moan when Agatha’s thumb brushed against her clit. “Fuck, I’m close,” she breathed. “Don’t you dare stop.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked against her lips, but she didn’t stop. She curled her fingers, faster and faster, until Rio came, eyes squeezed shut and back arched. Agatha drank in the sight and swore to herself to see it again as many times as she could tonight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When she pulled Rio deeper into her apartment, she went easily. The two of them stripped as they went, and as Agatha pushed Rio down onto her bed, she drank in the sight of her naked body. She wondered if Rio had been with anyone else during their break-up, and the thought sent a rush of jealousy through her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Starting with a harsh kiss to her lips, Agatha made her way down Rio’s body leaving a bruise everywhere she could. She wanted to lay claim to her again, give her every reminder she could that she was hers. She would always be Agatha’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio, who always knew her too well, hissed as Agatha sucked a particularly dark mark on her inner thigh. “Possessive much?” Rio asked, a coy smile on her lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked and answered with a nip to Rio’s hip bone. When Agatha pressed her tongue to Rio this time, she took her time with slow, broad strokes. She watched as she drew Rio closer and closer to the edge, ticking off every little tell. The jerk of her hips, the clench of her fists, the desperate whimpers she tried to hold back but couldn’t quite silence. Then, just as Rio was about to come, Agatha stopped and pulled away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gasped at the loss. Her fingers scrambled for Agatha and curled around long locks of hair. She pulled on them ruthlessly, making Agatha hiss. “Agatha,” Rio breathed. “Agatha, come on. Don’t tease.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m taking my time and enjoying the moment,” Agatha replied with a smug laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s fingers tightened their hold. She said, “You weren’t taking your time when you fucked me against the door ten minutes ago.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know,” Agatha pouted, “and now I’ve learned my lesson.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha,” Rio said. She was probably trying to sound annoyed, but all Agatha could hear was the desperate whine to her words.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just relax.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How am I supposed to relax when–” Rio’s words were drowned out by a moan as Agatha ran her tongue over her again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha did this, over and over, building Rio up only to stop just before she got what she wanted. By the time she finally let her come, Rio’s thighs were trembling, body stretched taut, eyes rolled back. It was a near silent orgasm, but as she came down from it, Agatha reveled in her ragged breathing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn’t until her breaths became more regular that Agatha moved back up her body, dropping light kisses as she went. When she reached her lips, Rio smiled into the kiss, lazy and sated. “I’ve missed this,” Rio murmured.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mm, I knew you were just using me for sex,” Agatha said playfully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed and wrapped her arms around Agatha, hugging her closer. “What can I say? A girl has needs.” Her hand slipped between their bodies, and Agatha groaned as her fingers brushed against the wetness between her thighs. “Speaking of needs,” Rio said, and this time she was the one who sounded smug.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha found it cuter than she should, this pride Rio had, as if she wasn’t the one who could have her completely undone in a way no one else could. She kissed her deeply as she spread her legs, straddling Rio’s hips. She thought Rio might tease her the way she had teased her, but without hesitation, Rio eased two then three fingers into her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn’t long until Agatha had her face buried in Rio’s neck, riding her fingers and moaning at every curl of them inside her. God, she’d missed this. Missed Rio. Missed the stretch of her inside her, the nails digging into her ass, the whispered praise in her ear. When Agatha came, she sank her teeth into the meat of Rio’s shoulder to muffle the scream that tore through her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Collapsing onto the bed, half on top of Rio, Agatha pressed a kiss to the mark left on Rio’s shoulder then laid on her chest. She felt Rio’s hand drift up and run through her hair, and her eyes fluttered shut. This was something else she missed. The tenderness after sex, the gentle caress after a rough fuck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re mine,” Rio whispered, so quietly that Agatha wasn’t sure she was supposed to hear it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled and whispered back, “And you’re mine.”
