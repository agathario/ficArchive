<h2 class="heading">Chapter One: Move-In Mayhem</h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness prided herself on her ability to maintain control. As a law student and an RA, she thrived on order. The small two-bedroom apartment assigned to her was no penthouse, but it was her sanctuary. Every book on her shelf was alphabetized, her schedule meticulously planned, and every surface spotless.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>The knock at her door was sharp and insistent, the kind that promised only trouble. Agatha frowned and glanced at the clock. Eight in the morning. Move-in day. Of course.</p><p>When she swung the door open, trouble was staring her right in the face.</p><p>The young woman standing in front of her had short, messy dark hair and an oversized hoodie that looked like it hadn’t seen a washing machine in weeks. A beat-up backpack was slung over one shoulder, and she was balancing a precariously stacked cart of boxes with one hand while holding a coffee cup in the other.</p><p>“Hey,” the woman said, flashing a grin that was somehow both charming and irritating. “You must be Agatha. I’m Rio. Your new roommate.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “I think you’re mistaken.”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened. “Nah, I’ve got the paperwork. Housing screwed up my dorm, so...here I am.”</p><p>Before Agatha could protest, Rio expertly maneuvered her cart around her and rolled it into the apartment. Agatha followed, her jaw tightening as she watched Rio survey the living room like she owned it.</p><p>“This is cozy,” Rio said, plopping her coffee on the kitchen counter. “Not bad for student housing.”</p><p>“This is my apartment,” Agatha snapped, closing the door with more force than necessary. “There must be a mistake.”</p><p>Rio dug into her hoodie pocket and produced a crumpled letter, which she handed to Agatha. “Nope. Housing says this is my new address. Guess we’re roomies.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the paper, her stomach sinking. It was all there in black and white: due to “unforeseen circumstances,” her one-bedroom apartment had been reassigned as a shared space.</p><p>“Fantastic,” she muttered under her breath.</p><p>Agatha stood frozen as Rio began unloading her boxes with the reckless abandon of someone who had never heard of personal boundaries. A skateboard clattered to the floor, followed by a stack of notebooks and what appeared to be a portable microphone.</p><p>“You can’t just—” Agatha started, but Rio interrupted her.</p><p>“Do you mind if I take the room on the left? I’m not picky, but it has better light, and I’ve got this blog thing I’m working on, so...” Rio trailed off, not waiting for an answer as she rolled her cart toward the room.</p><p>Agatha clenched her fists. “That’s my room.”</p><p>Rio paused in the doorway and glanced back at her. “Cool. We’ll figure it out.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to argue, but Rio was already pulling open boxes and dumping her belongings onto the floor. Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose and muttered a silent prayer for patience.</p><p>Agatha had just settled in to review her class schedule when she heard the distinct sound of wheels clattering across the hardwood floor. She looked up to see Rio skating—skating—through the living room on her beat-up skateboard.</p><p>“Excuse me,” Agatha snapped, standing abruptly. “This is not a skate park.”</p><p>“Relax, I’m just testing the space,” Rio said, hopping off the board and catching it with one hand. “By the way, this couch? Super uncomfortable. We might need to upgrade.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, utterly speechless. She took a deep breath, her mind racing to formulate a response, but Rio had already moved on, rummaging through the fridge.</p><p>“Did you touch my yogurt?” Agatha demanded as she saw the open container on the counter.</p><p>“Oh, was that yours?” Rio asked, spoon halfway to her mouth. “It had your name on it, so I figured it was the good stuff.”</p><p>“That’s not how labeling works.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Guess we’ve got different systems.”</p><p>Agatha’s eye twitched. “This isn’t going to work.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Sure it will. You just need to loosen up.”</p><p>By nightfall, the apartment was at war.</p><p>Agatha had set the thermostat to a comfortable 68 degrees before heading to bed. An hour later, she woke up sweating. Stumbling into the hallway, she found Rio sitting cross-legged on the living room floor, a microphone in front of her and her laptop open, clearly recording something.</p><p>“Did you touch the thermostat?” Agatha demanded.</p><p>Rio looked up, completely unfazed. “Yeah, it was freezing.”</p><p>“It was perfect,” Agatha snapped.</p><p>“For you, maybe,” Rio said, sipping a fresh coffee. “I’m not trying to catch hypothermia over here.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. “You can’t just adjust it without asking.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Cool. I’ll just adjust it without asking next time.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, then turned on her heel and stomped back to her room. The next morning, she ordered a lockbox for the thermostat.</p><p>Despite everything, there were moments when Rio was...almost tolerable. One evening, Agatha found her sitting on the balcony, legs dangling over the edge, a cup of coffee in one hand and her notebook in the other.</p><p>Agatha hesitated in the doorway before stepping outside. “Didn’t think you had a quiet mode.”</p><p>Rio glanced up, her usual smirk softened into something more thoughtful. “Even chaos needs a break sometimes.”</p><p>Agatha leaned against the railing, arms crossed. “What are you doing out here?”</p><p>“Thinking,” Rio said simply. She gestured toward the notebook. “Got this piece I’m working on for class. It’s about, like...identity or whatever. You know, figuring out who you are.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “And are you?”</p><p>“Figuring it out?” Rio shrugged. “Hell if I know. But starting over helps. No expectations. Just...me.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, unsure how to respond. For once, Rio seemed almost...normal. Human, even.</p><p>“It doesn’t get easier,” Agatha said finally. “But you learn to manage.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Managing seems like your specialty.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Get some sleep. You’ll need it if you plan on surviving this semester.”</p><p>Any goodwill they had built was shattered the next day when Agatha came home to find her meticulously alphabetized bookshelf rearranged by color.</p><p>“What the hell is this?” she demanded, staring at the shelves in horror.</p><p>“It’s a vibe,” Rio said from the couch, sipping her ever-present coffee. “Looks great, right?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha hissed. “It does not. It looks...wrong. You had no right—”</p><p>“I was helping!” Rio protested. “Your system was boring.”</p><p>“It was functional!”</p><p>“It was depressing.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, forcing herself to stay calm. “Put it back.”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio said, holding up her hands. “But you’re missing out.”</p><p>That night, as Agatha furiously scribbled in her journal, she found herself writing something unexpected:</p><p>
<em>“Rio Vidal is a walking disaster. She’s loud, messy, and completely infuriating. But...she’s also...interesting. Against all logic, I’m starting to care.”</em>
</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio lay sprawled on the couch, her laptop balanced on her knees as she typed. She glanced at Agatha’s closed door and smirked.</p><p>“She’s probably planning my murder,” Rio muttered to herself. “But hey, it’ll make for a great headline.”</p><p> </p>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha and Rio decide it's about time to set the rules in the house. The question is how long will they keep them...</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>If Agatha Harkness had learned anything in her twenty-five years of life, it was that chaos thrived in the absence of structure. Her new roommate, Rio Vidal, seemed hell-bent on proving that theory true.</p><p>After a week of living together, Agatha decided it was time to take action.</p><p>Agatha stood in the living room with a clipboard in hand, surveying the apartment. Rio was sprawled across the couch, laptop balanced on her knees, headphones around her neck, and a cup of coffee sitting precariously on the edge of the coffee table. She looked up lazily as Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p>“What’s with the clipboard?” Rio asked, one eyebrow quirking up.</p><p>“I’ve decided,” Agatha began, ignoring her tone, “that we need house rules.”</p><p>Rio snorted, setting her laptop aside. “House rules? What are we, eight?”</p><p>“Clearly not,” Agatha said, glaring at the empty coffee cups scattered across the room. “Which is why this is necessary.”</p><p>Rio folded her arms, smirking. “Alright, lay it on me, Mom.”</p><p>Agatha bristled but pressed on. “Rule one: No skateboarding indoors.”</p><p>“That’s a shame,” Rio said, shaking her head. “The acoustics in here are great.”</p><p>“Rule two,” Agatha continued, her voice rising slightly, “no touching my food without asking.”</p><p>“I’ll put my name on the yogurt next time,” Rio said, holding up her hands.</p><p>“Rule three: Keep the thermostat at 68 degrees. No exceptions.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “You and that thermostat. You know people lived without air conditioning for, like, centuries, right?”</p><p>“And they also died of heat exhaustion,” Agatha snapped. “Rule four: No rearranging my things.”</p><p>“I was improving the aesthetic,” Rio muttered under her breath.</p><p>Agatha shot her a warning look. “And rule five: No coffee cups left on the furniture.”</p><p>Rio looked at the cup teetering on the edge of the table and pushed it an inch farther away, grinning. “Satisfied?”</p><p>Agatha glared at her, then sighed. “I’m serious, Rio. This isn’t a dorm. It’s my home.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, her smirk fading slightly. “Our home now, isn’t it?”</p><p>Agatha froze for a moment, then cleared her throat. “Yes, well...follow the rules, and maybe it can feel that way.”</p><p>Later that night, Agatha came home from the library to find the apartment unusually quiet. Too quiet.</p><p>She paused in the doorway, her lawyerly instincts tingling. The lights were off, but the faint sound of typing drifted from the living room. She stepped inside cautiously, flipping the light switch.</p><p>“Surprise!” Rio called from the couch, turning her laptop around to face Agatha.</p><p>Agatha squinted at the screen. It was a Word document. The title read: Rio’s Rules for Living with Agatha.</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Agatha said, snatching the laptop away.</p><p>“Oh, come on,” Rio protested, laughing. “I’m just leveling the playing field.”</p><p>Agatha skimmed the list, her annoyance growing with every bullet point:</p><p>1. No lawyer jargon before 9 a.m.</p><p>2. No glaring at me when I finish your yogurt.</p><p>3. Let me win one thermostat battle a week.</p><p>4. Loosen up. Seriously.</p><p>5. Smile more. It won’t kill you.</p><p>Agatha’s hand tightened on the laptop. “Smile more? What is this, 1952?”</p><p>Rio leaned back, crossing her arms. “Hey, you’ve got your rules, I’ve got mine. Think of it as...mutual respect.”</p><p>Agatha glared at her for a long moment, then slammed the laptop shut. “This isn’t over.”</p><p>The next morning, Agatha was power-walking across campus, her bag slung over one shoulder and her usual coffee in hand, when she heard Rio calling her name.</p><p>“Agatha! Wait up!”</p><p>Agatha groaned internally but stopped. Rio jogged up beside her, looking far too awake for this hour. She was holding a camera and a notebook, her press badge clipped to her hoodie.</p><p>“What do you want?” Agatha asked, already impatient.</p><p>“Relax,” Rio said, falling into step beside her. “I’m working on a piece for the campus blog. Need a quote.”</p><p>Agatha eyed her suspiciously. “About what?”</p><p>“The housing crisis,” Rio said with a grin. “Specifically, how it’s forcing incompatible roommates to live together.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “I don’t have time for this.”</p><p>Rio flipped open her notebook, ignoring her. “So, on a scale of one to ten, how would you rate me as a roommate?”</p><p>“Zero,” Agatha said without hesitation.</p><p>“Harsh,” Rio said, jotting it down. “Follow-up question: Do you secretly admire my ability to drive you insane?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and picked up her pace. “Goodbye, Rio.”</p><p>“Admit it,” Rio called after her, laughing. “You’d miss me if I moved out!”</p><p>Agatha didn’t bother replying, but the thought lingered longer than she’d like.</p><p>That evening, Agatha returned to the apartment to find Rio sitting at the dining table, a stack of newspapers spread out in front of her. She was scribbling notes furiously, her usual smirk replaced by a look of intense concentration.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha asked, dropping her bag on the counter.</p><p>“Research,” Rio said, not looking up.</p><p>Agatha frowned. “For what?”</p><p>“My journalism class,” Rio replied. “I’m doing a profile on local businesses that closed during the pandemic. Trying to figure out if there’s a pattern.”</p><p>Agatha paused, watching her for a moment. Rio looked...serious. Focused. It was a side of her she hadn’t seen before.</p><p>“That’s...ambitious,” Agatha said finally.</p><p>Rio glanced up, her expression unreadable. “Yeah, well. Journalism’s not exactly a nine-to-five gig.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then sat down across from her. “Do you need help?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You want to help me? The same person who almost murdered me over a yogurt?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m good at research. And if you’re going to be here all night, I’d rather you not destroy the place.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Fair enough. Grab a paper.”</p><p>Their truce lasted exactly twelve hours. The next morning, Agatha woke up to find a coffee ring on the dining table, right on top of her study notes.</p><p>She stormed into the living room, where Rio was sprawled on the couch, headphones in, editing something on her laptop.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha snapped.</p><p>Rio pulled out one earbud, raising an eyebrow. “Morning to you too.”</p><p>“Did you put this—” Agatha held up the paper, waving it like a weapon, “—on the table without a coaster?”</p><p>Rio blinked, then grinned. “You’re really passionate about furniture, huh?”</p><p>“Do you have any idea how much work this will take to reprint?” Agatha fumed.</p><p>Rio leaned back, unbothered. “It’s a coffee stain. Adds character.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to unleash a tirade, but Rio cut her off.</p><p>“Relax, Harkness. Life’s messy. You can’t control everything.”</p><p>Agatha froze, Rio’s words cutting deeper than they should. She glared at her for a long moment, then stormed back to her room, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>That night, as Agatha sat at her desk rewriting her notes, she found herself muttering under her breath. “Life’s messy. What kind of advice is that?”</p><p>In the living room, Rio was typing away on her laptop, earbuds in, her smirk firmly in place. She glanced at the closed door to Agatha’s room and chuckled.</p><p>“Control freaks,” she muttered. “Can’t live with them, can’t live without them.”</p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha woke to the sound of clicking. Not the familiar sound of a keyboard, which she’d begrudgingly gotten used to, but something sharper, faster.</p><p>She groaned, rolling over and squinting at her clock. It was 6:30 a.m. Too early for whatever nonsense Rio was concocting.</p><p>Throwing on a robe, she marched into the living room, prepared to lay down the law. She froze in the doorway.</p><p>Rio was sitting cross-legged on the floor, a pile of Legos spread out around her, a small model of what looked like...a coffee shop taking shape in front of her.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha asked, her voice heavy with disbelief.</p><p>Rio didn’t look up. “Building my dream café.”</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “With Legos?”</p><p>“Yup,” Rio said, popping the ‘p.’ “It’s for a story I’m pitching. Something about small businesses and how creative spaces thrive in post-pandemic communities. Thought I’d visualize it.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. “You couldn’t do this at a reasonable hour?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Inspiration struck. Besides, you’re up now. Wanna help?”</p><p>Agatha stared at her as though she’d suggested jumping off a bridge. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>“Your loss,” Rio said, picking up a tiny chair and snapping it into place. “But if you step on one of these later, don’t blame me.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, retreating to the kitchen. She poured herself a cup of coffee and watched Rio out of the corner of her eye. As much as she hated to admit it, there was something endearing about her chaotic determination.</p><p>That afternoon, Agatha found herself in a crowded campus coffee shop, her laptop open and her notes spread across the table. She was halfway through drafting a legal brief when a familiar voice cut through the noise.</p><p>“Well, well. If it isn’t the queen of order herself.”</p><p>Agatha looked up to see Rio standing in line, holding a notebook and grinning at her.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Agatha asked, already dreading the answer.</p><p>“Interviewing the baristas,” Rio said, pulling out her press badge and waving it dramatically. “Gotta get the inside scoop for my article.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Don’t you have a journalism office or something?”</p><p>Rio grabbed her coffee and slid into the seat across from Agatha without asking. “I like working in the field. You’d know about that if you ever left the library.”</p><p>“I’m productive in the library,” Agatha said, closing her laptop slightly, clearly annoyed by the interruption.</p><p>“Productivity’s overrated,” Rio said, taking a long sip of her drink. “Sometimes you just need a change of scenery.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “And what’s your scenery supposed to be? Chaos and overpriced lattes?”</p><p>“Exactly,” Rio said with a grin. “Speaking of which, you should try the caramel macchiato here. Life-changing.”</p><p>“I’ll stick to plain coffee, thanks,” Agatha said, her tone clipped.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, studying her. “You know, for someone studying law, you don’t seem to like bending the rules much.”</p><p>“That’s because rules exist for a reason,” Agatha snapped.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Rio said, waving her off. “But where’s the fun in following them all the time?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer, but the faintest hint of a smile tugged at her lips.</p><p>Later that evening, Agatha was back in the apartment, staring at the piles of work on her desk. Her head ached, and she was barely halfway through her reading for the week. She considered making another cup of coffee but decided against it. She needed a break.</p><p>Stepping into the living room, she found Rio once again surrounded by Legos, this time assembling what looked like an absurdly detailed fountain.</p><p>“What is that?” Agatha asked, pointing to the half-finished structure.</p><p>“It’s for the outdoor seating area,” Rio said, not looking up. “Gotta make it look inviting.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, then surprised herself by sitting on the floor next to Rio. “You know this is ridiculous, right?”</p><p>“Most great ideas are,” Rio said with a shrug.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha just watched her work, marveling at how focused she could be despite the sheer absurdity of what she was doing. Without thinking, Agatha reached for a piece and snapped it into place.</p><p>Rio paused, looking at her in mock surprise. “Are you...helping me?”</p><p>“Don’t read into it,” Agatha said quickly. “I needed a distraction.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Rio said, her grin widening. “Admit it—you’re starting to like me.”</p><p>“I tolerate you,” Agatha said firmly.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s basically a compliment,” Rio said, laughing.</p><p>The next evening, Rio decided to cook dinner. Agatha knew this was a bad idea the moment she saw the mess in the kitchen.</p><p>“Are you making lasagna or summoning demons?” Agatha asked, gesturing to the splatters of sauce on the counter.</p><p>“Both,” Rio said, carefully layering noodles in a pan. “This is my abuela’s recipe.”</p><p>“You have an abuela who makes lasagna?” Agatha asked, skeptical.</p><p>“Not biologically,” Rio said with a smirk. “But there was this old lady down the block who used to feed me when I'd sneak out of my foster homes. Close enough.”</p><p>Agatha paused, caught off guard by the admission. “That’s...nice.”</p><p>Rio waved her off. “Don’t get sentimental on me. Hand me the parmesan.”</p><p>Against her better judgment, Agatha stayed to help, though she spent most of the time cleaning up Rio’s mess. By the time the lasagna was in the oven, the kitchen was somewhat presentable.</p><p>When they sat down to eat, Agatha took one bite and froze.</p><p>“What?” Rio asked, watching her expectantly.</p><p>“This is...actually good,” Agatha admitted reluctantly.</p><p>Rio grinned. “Told you. Stick with me, Harkness. I’ll change your life.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t stop herself from smiling.</p><p>After dinner, Agatha retreated to her room, but sleep eluded her. Around midnight, she found herself wandering into the living room, where Rio was sitting on the couch, staring at her laptop.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha asked, leaning against the doorway.</p><p>“Editing,” Rio said, not looking up. “This article’s kicking my ass.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then walked over and sat next to her. “What’s the problem?”</p><p>Rio sighed, running a hand through her hair. “It’s just...this story’s important, you know? Like, people need to hear it. But I can’t figure out how to tie it all together.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment. “Start with the human element. Why does this story matter to you?”</p><p>Rio blinked, clearly not expecting the advice. “Because...I know what it’s like to lose something. To feel like the world’s stacked against you.”</p><p>“Then start there,” Agatha said simply.</p><p>Rio stared at her for a long moment, then nodded slowly. “Thanks, Harkness.”</p><p>“Don’t mention it,” Agatha said, standing. “But if you’re up all night again, keep the noise down.”</p><p>“Bossy as ever,” Rio muttered, but there was no bite in her tone.</p><p>In the living room, Rio stared at her screen, the words finally flowing. She glanced at the hallway where Agatha’s door was closed and smirked.</p><p>“She’s not so bad,” Rio muttered to herself. “For a control freak.”</p><p>That night, as Agatha lay in bed, she found herself smiling. Maybe chaos wasn’t so bad after all. </p><p>She hadn't spoken to Wanda in nearly a week, which was unusual for them. They’d been best friends since they were kids, bonded over a mutual disdain for playground politics and an affinity for sarcastic commentary. But life, as it often did, had gotten in the way.</p><p>Wanda was busy with her directing coursework, and Agatha was drowning in legal briefs and the chaos of living with Rio Vidal. Still, tonight was their designated “catch-up call,” and Agatha wasn’t about to miss it.</p><p>She locked herself in her room, the muffled sound of Rio typing in the living room or clattering around the kitchen serving as background noise. Propping her laptop on her desk, she called Wanda. A moment later, the screen lit up with Wanda’s face, her scarlet hair pulled into a messy bun and a pencil tucked behind her ear.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Wanda said, grinning. “I was starting to think you’d forgotten about me.”</p><p>“Hardly,” Agatha said, leaning back in her chair. “You’re just always on some film set or buried in storyboards.”</p><p>Wanda shrugged dramatically. “What can I say? Genius takes time.”</p><p>“And humility, clearly,” Agatha said dryly.</p><p>Wanda laughed, then tilted her head, studying her. “Okay, spill. You’ve got your ‘I’m stressed but pretending I’m fine’ face on.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, rubbing her temples. “It’s my new roommate. She’s...impossible.”</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “Impossible how? Like, ‘leaves dishes in the sink’ impossible or ‘secretly a serial killer’ impossible?”</p><p>“Somewhere in between,” Agatha muttered. “She’s messy, loud, and completely unbothered by rules. She ate my yogurt, Wanda. My yogurt.”</p><p>Wanda snorted. “Truly horrifying.”</p><p>“I’m serious!” Agatha said, throwing up her hands. “She’s turned my perfectly organized life into chaos.”</p><p>“And yet,” Wanda said, smirking, “you don’t seem as annoyed as you should be.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“It means,” Wanda said, leaning closer to the camera, “you sound like you might actually like her.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “I tolerate her. Barely.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Wanda said, unconvinced. “Well, for what it’s worth, chaos isn’t always a bad thing. Maybe she’ll teach you to loosen up a bit.”</p><p>“Not you too,” Agatha groaned. “That’s her favorite line.”</p><p>Wanda laughed. “See? You’re already quoting her. You’re doomed.”</p>

<p>The apartment door slammed shut, startling Agatha out of her thoughts. She stood, heading into the living room just in time to see Rio tossing her bag onto the couch. Her usual smirk was nowhere to be found, replaced by a tight-lipped expression and furrowed brows.</p><p>“What happened to you?” Agatha asked, crossing her arms.</p><p>Rio glanced at her, then flopped onto the couch, covering her face with her hands. “Don’t ask.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “That bad?”</p><p>Rio let out a frustrated groan. “Worse. My professor basically ripped my article to shreds in front of the whole class. Said my writing was ‘too emotional’ and ‘not objective enough.’ Whatever the hell that means.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, unsure how to respond. She’d never seen Rio like this—quiet, subdued, almost...vulnerable.</p><p>“Well,” Agatha said finally, sitting on the armrest of the couch, “was he right?”</p><p>Rio shot her a glare. “Seriously? That’s your take?”</p><p>“I’m just asking,” Agatha said, holding up her hands defensively. “Maybe he had a point.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio muttered, sitting up and running a hand through her hair. “But it’s not like I’m writing for the New York Times or something. It’s a student blog. What’s the big deal if I add a little personality?”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment, then sighed. “Look, professors can be—” she searched for the right word, “—difficult. But that doesn’t mean you’re a bad writer. You wouldn’t be in journalism if you didn’t have talent.”</p><p>Rio blinked, clearly surprised by the compliment. “Did you just...say something nice to me?”</p><p>“Don’t let it go to your head,” Agatha said, standing. “But for what it’s worth, I think you’re good at what you do. Even if it is a little chaotic.”</p><p>Rio’s lips quirked into a faint smile. “Thanks, Harkness.”</p><p>An hour later, Agatha found herself standing awkwardly in the kitchen, debating her next move. Rio was still on the couch, scrolling through her phone and looking uncharacteristically deflated.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t great at emotional support, but something about Rio’s defeated expression made her want to try. She rummaged through the pantry, pulling out a box of brownie mix she’d been saving for a particularly stressful day.</p><p>“Do you want brownies?” Agatha called over her shoulder.</p><p>“What?” Rio asked, looking up.</p><p>“Brownies,” Agatha repeated. “I’m making them. Do you want some or not?”</p><p>Rio stared at her for a moment, then nodded slowly. “Regular brownies or...space brownies? Nevermind. Why not?”</p><p>Agatha set to work, measuring out ingredients with precision while Rio watched from the couch. By the time the brownies were in the oven, the apartment smelled like chocolate, and Rio seemed slightly less tense.</p><p>“Didn’t peg you as the baking type,” Rio said as Agatha joined her in the living room.</p><p>“It’s therapeutic,” Agatha said with a shrug. “And occasionally necessary.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “You’re full of surprises, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t reply.</p><p>When the brownies were done, Agatha cut them into neat squares and brought a plate to the coffee table. Rio grabbed one immediately, taking a bite and groaning dramatically.</p><p>“Oh my god,” she said, her eyes wide. “These are amazing.”</p><p>“They’re boxed,” Agatha said dryly. “Calm down.”</p><p>“Still,” Rio said, reaching for another. “You might actually have a soul.”</p><p>“Don’t get used to it,” Agatha said, but there was a faint smile on her lips.</p><p>For the first time all day, Rio looked relaxed. They sat in comfortable silence for a while, the tension between them easing.</p><p>As the night wore on, Agatha found herself feeling oddly content. Maybe Wanda was right—maybe chaos wasn’t always a bad thing.</p><p>Rio, meanwhile, was staring at her laptop, the brownies giving her a much-needed sugar rush. She glanced at Agatha, who was flipping through one of her law textbooks, and smirked.</p><p>“Hey, Harkness?” she said.</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked without looking up.</p><p>“You’re not the worst roommate I’ve ever had.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “High praise.”</p><p>Rio grinned, popping another brownie into her mouth. “Don’t let it go to your head.”</p><p>The next morning Agatha began her mornings as opposed to her usual way (coffee in hand, her planner open, and her day meticulously organized into neat blocks of time). It was a ritual, one that grounded her in a world of unpredictability.</p><p>Except today, her ritual was interrupted.</p><p>“Do you ever sit still?” she muttered, watching Rio pace the living room, headphones clamped over her ears as she gestured animatedly to no one in particular. The faint hum of music escaped the headphones, something chaotic and loud, much like the woman wearing them.</p><p>Rio pulled off the headphones, raising an eyebrow. “What?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, setting down her coffee. “Why are you pacing like a lunatic?”</p><p>“I’m brainstorming,” Rio said, as if it were obvious. “Got this idea for an exposé, but I’m stuck on the angle.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a long moment, then sighed again. “You’re exhausting.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio said, flashing a grin before plopping onto the couch. “So, you’re the queen of rules and order. Got any advice for organizing my thoughts?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Write them down.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Helpful.”</p><p>Despite herself, Agatha found Rio’s energy infectious. By the time she finished her coffee, she was seated across from Rio at the dining table, surrounded by a chaotic pile of notes and half-finished outlines.</p><p>“What’s this exposé about, anyway?” Agatha asked, flipping through one of Rio’s notebooks.</p><p>“Campus security,” Rio said, leaning back in her chair. “Did you know they’re cutting the budget for student safety programs? Meanwhile, they’re spending a fortune on new stadium seating for the football team.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “That’s...surprisingly valid.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Don’t sound so shocked, Harkness. I do actual journalism sometimes.”</p><p>“And you’re stuck on the angle?” Agatha asked, ignoring the jab.</p><p>Rio nodded. “I don’t want it to just be another boring article about numbers and budgets. I want people to care, you know?”</p><p>Agatha tapped her fingers on the table, thinking. “Focus on the human element. Interview students who’ve been affected by the lack of resources. Show how the cuts have real consequences.”</p><p>Rio blinked, then nodded slowly. “That’s...actually a good idea.”</p><p>“Don’t sound so shocked,” Agatha said with a smirk.</p><p>Rio laughed. “Fair enough.”</p><p>Later that afternoon, Agatha decided to treat herself to a rare break. She curled up on the couch with a book, enjoying the quiet—until a sharp knock at the door shattered her peace.</p><p>“Expecting someone?” she asked, glancing at Rio, who was sprawled on the floor with her laptop.</p><p>“Nope,” Rio said, not looking up.</p><p>Agatha stood, smoothing her clothes as she walked to the door. She opened it to find a tall man with a clipboard and an officious air.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness?” he asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said warily.</p><p>“I'm here to discuss the thermostat lockbox,” the man said, glancing over her shoulder. “We’ve received complaints.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “Complaints from whom?”</p><p>The man didn’t answer, but Agatha didn’t need him to. She turned to glare at Rio, who was suddenly very interested in her laptop.</p><p>“Vidal,” Agatha said sharply.</p><p>Rio looked up, feigning innocence. “What?”</p><p>“You reported the thermostat?” Agatha asked, her voice dangerously calm.</p><p>“It’s a public health issue,” Rio said with a shrug. “Do you know how cold it gets in here?”</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “We are going to have a very serious conversation later.”</p><p>The man cleared his throat. “In the meantime, I’ll have to remove the lockbox.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Fine. Do whatever you have to.”</p><p>As the man worked, Rio smirked at Agatha. “You’re not mad, are you?”</p><p>“Mad?” Agatha said, her tone icy. “No. Furious? Absolutely.”</p><p>Once the man left, Agatha turned to Rio, her arms crossed. “You can’t just go behind my back like that.”</p><p>Rio stood, hands on her hips. “And you can’t just freeze me out—literally.”</p><p>“I set it at 68 degrees,” Agatha said. “That’s perfectly reasonable.”</p><p>“Not for someone with circulation issues,” Rio shot back.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Circulation issues?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, gesturing vaguely. “My hands get cold. It’s a thing.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a moment, then sighed. “Fine. We’ll compromise. 70 degrees.”</p><p>“72,” Rio countered.</p><p>“69,” Agatha said firmly.</p><p>Rio smirked. “Nice.”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Just...fine. Whatever. But if you touch the thermostat again, I’m getting another lockbox.”</p><p>“Deal,” Rio said, grinning.</p><p>That evening, Rio convinced Agatha to join her for dinner off campus. It wasn’t Agatha’s idea of a good time, but Rio’s enthusiasm was hard to resist.</p><p>The restaurant was a small, bustling Italian place with mismatched chairs and checkered tablecloths. Rio ordered a pizza and a bottle of wine, chatting animatedly with the waiter as Agatha studied the menu.</p><p>“You come here often?” Agatha asked as the waiter left.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said. “It’s my go-to spot when I need to de-stress.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “You? Stressed?”</p><p>“Occasionally,” Rio said with a smirk. “Even chaos has its limits.”</p><p>They talked as they ate, the conversation surprisingly easy. Agatha found herself laughing more than she expected, and Rio seemed genuinely interested in her stories about law school.</p><p>“You know,” Rio said as they finished their meal, “you’re not as boring as you look.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha said dryly. “I think.”</p><p>When they returned to the apartment, Agatha was about to retreat to her room when she noticed Rio sitting on the balcony, her laptop forgotten on the coffee table. She hesitated, then walked over.</p><p>“Not working?” Agatha asked, leaning against the doorframe.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Couldn’t focus.”</p><p>Agatha stepped outside, sitting in the chair next to her. “What’s on your mind?”</p><p>Rio sighed, staring out at the city lights. “That professor. What he said about my writing—it got to me.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha asked. “You don’t seem like the type to care what people think.”</p><p>“I don’t, usually,” Rio said. “But this...writing is the one thing I’m good at. If I’m not good enough at that...then what am I even doing?”</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a moment, then said, “You’re better than good, Rio. You’re passionate. That’s what makes your writing stand out.”</p><p>Rio glanced at her, surprised. “You really think so?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t say it if I didn’t,” Agatha said simply.</p><p>Rio smiled, the tension in her shoulders easing. “Thanks, Harkness.”</p><p>“Don’t mention it,” Agatha said, standing. “Now, get some sleep. You’ll feel better in the morning.”</p><p>That night, as Agatha lay in bed, she realized she didn’t entirely hate the chaos Rio brought into her life. And for Rio, the reassurance from Agatha felt like a small victory—one she didn’t know she needed.</p><p>Living with Rio Vidal was like living with a storm: unpredictable, loud, and occasionally leaving behind surprising moments of calm. For Agatha Harkness, it was a constant push-and-pull—control versus chaos, precision versus spontaneity.</p><p>But somehow, they hadn’t killed each other. Yet.</p><p>The next morning Agatha walked into the kitchen to find Rio at the stove, wearing her usual hoodie and shorts combo, humming off-key to a pop song. A frying pan sizzled in front of her, and the smell of bacon filled the air.</p><p>Agatha paused in the doorway, suspicious. “What’s going on?”</p><p>“Morning,” Rio said without turning around. “I’m making breakfast.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha asked, narrowing her eyes.</p><p>“Because I’m hungry?” Rio said, glancing over her shoulder. “And I figured you could use some too.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. “What did you do?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Why do you assume I did something?”</p><p>“Because you’re you,” Agatha said flatly.</p><p>Rio turned off the stove and plated the bacon, along with scrambled eggs and toast. She set the plate on the table in front of Agatha with a flourish. “See? No ulterior motive. Just breakfast.”</p><p>Agatha sat down reluctantly, poking at the food with her fork. “You're actually not a bad cook you know. If journalism doesn't pan out, you could become a chef. ”</p><p>“High praise once again,” Rio said with a smirk, grabbing her own plate and sitting across from her. “You’re welcome.”</p><p>As they ate, Agatha found herself relaxing—a rare occurrence in Rio’s presence. She hated to admit it, but the breakfast was actually good.</p><p>Later that day, Agatha returned from class to find the living room in chaos. Again.</p><p>“What are you doing now?” Agatha asked, dropping her bag and staring at the mess. Rio was sitting on the floor, surrounded by what looked like poster boards, markers, and stacks of printed articles.</p><p>“I’m working on a pitch for the campus paper,” Rio said, not looking up. “It’s a series on student activism.”</p><p>“And the poster boards are for...?” Agatha prompted.</p><p>“Visual aids,” Rio said, waving a marker in the air. “Gotta sell the idea, you know?”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Do you ever clean up after yourself?”</p><p>“Eventually,” Rio said with a grin. “Come on, Harkness. Don’t you have a rebellious side?”</p><p>“I prefer order,” Agatha said, picking up a stray marker and placing it on the table. “Someone has to keep this place from falling apart.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “You’re such a control freak. It’s kind of endearing.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t reply. Instead, she grabbed a piece of poster board and started organizing Rio’s notes into neat rows.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Are you...helping me?”</p><p>“Don’t read into it,” Agatha said. “I just can’t stand the chaos.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Rio said, smirking. “You’re totally warming up to me.”</p><p>“Keep dreaming,” Agatha said, but there was a hint of a smile on her lips.</p><p>That evening, Rio found Agatha sitting at the dining table, staring at her laptop with a look of utter frustration.</p><p>“Uh-oh,” Rio said, leaning against the doorway. “What’s wrong, Harkness? Lose a case?”</p><p>“It’s not a case,” Agatha snapped, rubbing her temples. “It’s an ethics paper. And it’s due tomorrow.”</p><p>“Let me guess,” Rio said, sliding into the chair across from her. “You’ve already written it three times, but it’s not ‘perfect’ yet.”</p><p>Agatha glared at her. “This isn’t a joke, Rio. It’s important.”</p><p>“Relax,” Rio said, holding up her hands. “I’m just saying, maybe you’re overthinking it.”</p><p>“I don’t overthink,” Agatha said defensively.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You alphabetize your books by genre and subgenre. You overthink.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, closing her laptop. “Fine. What do you suggest?”</p><p>“Just write what you actually think,” Rio said. “Stop worrying about what your professor wants to hear.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, considering her words. “That’s...surprisingly decent advice.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Don’t sound so shocked all the time. I have my moments”</p><p>Rio convinced Agatha to join her for an open mic night at a campus café. It wasn’t Agatha’s usual scene, but Rio’s enthusiasm was hard to resist.</p><p>The café was crowded and loud, filled with students laughing and chatting. Rio ordered them drinks and found a table near the stage.</p><p>“You’ll love this,” Rio said, handing Agatha a cup of tea. “The performers are either amazing or so bad it’s hilarious.”</p><p>“Sounds promising,” Agatha said dryly.</p><p>As the performances began, Agatha found herself relaxing. Some acts were genuinely impressive—singers, poets, even a stand-up comedian. Others were...less so, but Rio’s running commentary kept her entertained.</p><p>“See that guy?” Rio whispered, nodding toward a guitarist. “He’s been playing the same three chords for five minutes.”</p><p>Agatha stifled a laugh. “You’re terrible.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said with a grin.</p><p>By the end of the night, Agatha realized she was actually having fun—a rare occurrence outside her meticulously planned world.</p><p>When they got home, Agatha expected Rio to retreat to her laptop, but instead, she found her sitting on the balcony, staring out at the city lights.</p><p>“What’s with you and balconies?” Agatha asked, stepping outside.</p><p>Rio shrugged. “They’re peaceful.”</p><p>Agatha sat down next to her, crossing her arms. “You? Peaceful?”</p><p>Rio laughed softly. “Even I need a break sometimes.”</p><p>They sat in comfortable silence for a while, the city buzzing faintly below them. Finally, Rio spoke.</p><p>“Do you ever think about what you want? Like, really want?”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean, you’re always so...driven,” Rio said. “It’s like you’ve got your whole life planned out. But do you ever stop to think about what makes you happy?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, caught off guard by the question. “I want to make a difference,” she said finally. “That’s what makes me happy.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly. “That’s a good answer. Very...you.”</p><p>“What about you?” Agatha asked, turning the question back on her.</p><p>Rio smiled faintly. “I just want to tell stories that matter. To show people the world the way I see it.”</p><p>“That’s a good answer,” Agatha said softly.</p><p>They sat in silence again, the moment unexpectedly intimate.</p><p>That night, as Agatha lay in bed, she found herself thinking about Rio’s question. For someone so chaotic, she had a way of cutting through the noise and making her think.</p><p>And for Rio, the conversation lingered in her mind. Maybe, just maybe, there was more to Agatha Harkness than she’d originally thought.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha Harkness was not the jealous type. Or so she told herself.</p><p>She had no reason to be. Rio Vidal was her roommate—nothing more. Sure, they’d found some semblance of a truce, even moments of camaraderie, but at the end of the day, their lives were separate. Agatha had her law school ambitions, and Rio had...whatever chaos fueled her journalism dreams.</p><p>Which was why the sight that greeted her when she walked into their apartment that evening struck a nerve she refused to acknowledge.</p><p>It had been a long day. Agatha had planned to stay late at the library, but a canceled study session left her unexpectedly free. She arrived home, craving nothing more than a cup of tea and a quiet evening. But as she opened the door, the sound of laughter froze her mid-step.</p><p>Voices—plural. And not just Rio’s.</p><p>Frowning, Agatha set her bag down and walked into the living room. There, sprawled across the couch with Rio, was a woman she didn’t recognize. She had short blonde hair, an effortless smile, and was leaning far too close to Rio for Agatha’s liking.</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio exclaimed, sitting up straight. She looked...caught. “What are you doing here? I thought you’d be at the library.”</p><p>“I live here,” Agatha said, her voice clipped. Her gaze flicked to the blonde. “Who’s this?”</p><p>“Uh, this is Sam,” Rio said, gesturing to her companion. “Sam, this is my roommate, Agatha.”</p><p>Sam smiled, extending a hand. “Nice to meet you.”</p><p>Agatha ignored the hand, crossing her arms. “Likewise.”</p><p>An awkward silence followed, broken only by Sam’s nervous laugh. “So, uh, how’s law school?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at Rio. “Fine. I didn’t realize we were entertaining guests.”</p><p>Rio winced. “It was kind of...spur of the moment.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Clearly.”</p><p>Agatha retreated to the kitchen, muttering under her breath as she put the kettle on. She wasn’t sure why she was so irritated. Rio was an adult. She could date whoever she wanted.</p><p>Still, the sight of Sam lounging on her couch, laughing at her roommate’s jokes, made Agatha’s stomach twist in ways she didn’t care to examine.</p><p>A few minutes later, Rio appeared in the doorway, looking sheepish. “Hey.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked, not turning around.</p><p>“Sorry about that,” Rio said, leaning against the counter. “I didn’t think you’d be home.”</p><p>Agatha turned, fixing her with a glare. “Obviously.”</p><p>Rio raised her hands. “Look, I can ask her to leave if it’s a problem.”</p><p>“It’s not a problem,” Agatha snapped, though her tone said otherwise. “This is your home too.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “You sure? Because you seem...tense.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said, turning back to her tea. “Enjoy your evening.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, clearly unconvinced, but eventually nodded. “Alright. Thanks, Harkness.”</p><p>As Rio disappeared back into the living room, Agatha let out a frustrated sigh. She was not jealous. She wasn’t.</p><p>Agatha tried to focus on her reading, but the laughter from the living room was impossible to ignore. Every time Sam laughed at one of Rio’s jokes, Agatha felt her jaw tighten. Eventually, she gave up and headed to the kitchen for another cup of tea.</p><p>It was there that she overheard them.</p><p>“So, how long have you been living with Agatha?” Sam asked, her tone light.</p><p>“A few months,” Rio replied. “She’s...intense. But in a good way, you know? Like, she keeps me grounded.”</p><p>Sam chuckled. “Grounded, huh? I didn’t think you were the type.”</p><p>“Yeah, well,” Rio said, and Agatha could practically hear her smirk. “She’s good for me. Don’t tell her I said that, though.”</p><p>Agatha froze, her heart skipping a beat. She didn’t know whether to be flattered or annoyed.</p><p>Eventually, Sam left. Agatha stayed in her room, pretending to be engrossed in her work, but she couldn’t help but hear the goodbyes at the door.</p><p>“Thanks for tonight,” Sam said, her voice soft.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replied. “It was fun. I’ll text you.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted again. She hated this—hated feeling like this. It wasn’t her business who Rio dated. It wasn’t.</p><p>A few minutes later, Rio knocked on her door.</p><p>“What?” Agatha called, her voice sharper than she intended.</p><p>Rio poked her head in, her usual smirk replaced by a look of genuine curiosity. “You okay?”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I be?” Agatha asked, not looking up from her laptop.</p><p>“Because you’ve been weird all night,” Rio said, stepping inside. “Did I do something?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, closing her laptop and meeting Rio’s gaze. “It’s not you. It’s...nothing. Forget it.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Doesn’t sound like nothing.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then shook her head. “It’s really not my business.”</p><p>Rio frowned, sitting on the edge of the bed. “Agatha, if something’s bothering you, just say it.”</p><p>For a moment, Agatha considered telling her the truth. But the words wouldn’t come. Instead, she said, “Next time, just give me a heads-up when you’re bringing someone over.”</p><p>Rio studied her for a moment, then nodded. “Fair enough.”</p><p>Agatha forced a small smile. “Goodnight, Rio.”</p><p>“Goodnight,” Rio said, standing. As she left, she paused in the doorway, glancing back at Agatha. “Hey. Thanks for being cool about it.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, but as the door closed, she couldn’t help but feel anything but.</p><p>The next morning, Agatha found Rio in the kitchen, sipping coffee and scrolling through her phone. She looked up as Agatha entered, her smirk returning.</p><p>“Morning, Harkness.”</p><p>“Morning,” Agatha said, grabbing a mug. “Sam leave early?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “She left last night. Sorry again if it bothered you.”</p><p>“It didn’t,” Agatha said quickly, too quickly.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You sure? Because you seemed...tense.”</p><p>“I wasn’t tense,” Agatha insisted, pouring her coffee.</p><p>“Right,” Rio said, clearly unconvinced. “Anyway, I’ll let you know next time. Deal?”</p><p>“Deal,” Agatha said, sipping her coffee. She hesitated, then added, “For what it’s worth, she seems nice.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Yeah, she is.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, forcing herself to focus on her coffee. She wasn’t jealous. She wasn’t.</p><p>But as Rio scrolled through her phone, smiling at a text Agatha didn’t need to see, she couldn’t help but wonder why it felt like she was.</p><p>That day, as Agatha buried herself in her studies, she tried to push the night before out of her mind. But the image of Rio and Sam laughing on the couch lingered, and no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that she didn’t want to examine too closely.</p><p>For Rio, the evening had been fun, but as she glanced at Agatha throughout the day, she couldn’t help but feel like something had shifted. What it was, she wasn’t sure—but she knew she wasn’t ready to let it go.</p><p>
<em>Later that day </em>
</p><p>Rio Vidal wasn’t one to back down from a fight. If she was, she wouldn’t have pursued journalism. She thrived on uncovering uncomfortable truths, no matter how much trouble it caused. But sitting in the apartment that night, staring at the email on her laptop, she felt a rare pang of doubt.</p><p>The subject line read: “Mandatory Meeting with Campus Authorities”. The body of the email was vague but clear enough—her latest exposé had ruffled feathers in all the wrong places.</p><p>“Damn it,” Rio muttered under her breath, running a hand through her hair.</p><p>“What did you do this time?” Agatha’s voice cut through her thoughts, sharp and familiar.</p><p>Rio looked up to see her roommate standing in the doorway, arms crossed and an eyebrow raised.</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio said quickly, closing her laptop.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “You’re a terrible liar.”</p><p>Rio sighed, leaning back in her chair. “It’s just...a thing with campus admin. No big deal.”</p><p>“If it’s ‘no big deal,’ why do you look like someone kicked your puppy?” Agatha asked, stepping into the room.</p><p>“Because they’re threatening to pull my article from the campus paper and even my scholarship,” Rio admitted, her voice tinged with frustration. “Apparently, calling out budget mismanagement is ‘damaging to the university’s reputation.’”</p><p>Agatha’s frown deepened. “What exactly did you write?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then opened her laptop and pulled up the draft. She handed it to Agatha, who read in silence, her expression growing more serious with each line.</p><p>When she finished, Agatha looked up. “This is solid work, Rio. Well-researched, clear, and, most importantly, accurate.”</p><p>“Try telling that to admin,” Rio said bitterly. “They don’t care about accuracy. They care about optics.”</p><p>Agatha sat down across from her, her tone firm. “You’re not backing down.”</p><p>“Wasn’t planning to,” Rio said, though her confidence wavered slightly. “But I don’t exactly have a game plan here.”</p><p>“Lucky for you,” Agatha said, a glint of determination in her eye, “I do.”</p><p>The next morning, Agatha commandeered the dining table, spreading out Rio’s research alongside her own legal notes. Rio sat across from her, nursing a cup of coffee and watching in awe as Agatha worked.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha began, tapping her pen against her clipboard. “Here’s what we’re going to do. First, we’ll double-check every source in your article. If they want to accuse you of libel, we’ll make it impossible.”</p><p>“Already did that,” Rio said. “Twice.”</p><p>“Then we’ll do it a third time,” Agatha said without missing a beat. “After that, we’ll draft a statement defending your article. Something professional but firm.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “We?”</p><p>“Yes, we,” Agatha said, glaring at her. “If you want to keep that article published and your future in this university, you’re going to need help. Lucky for you, I’m very good at this.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but smile. “You really are something, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Save the compliments for when we win.”</p><p>The meeting with campus authorities was scheduled for that afternoon. Agatha insisted on accompanying Rio, despite Rio’s protests.</p><p>“You don’t have to do this,” Rio said as they walked across campus.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha replied, her tone leaving no room for argument. “But I’m doing it anyway.”</p><p>The meeting room was as intimidating as Rio expected—sterile and corporate, with a long table and a panel of administrators sitting at one end. Rio took a deep breath as she and Agatha entered.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal,” one of the administrators began, adjusting his glasses. “Thank you for coming.”</p><p>Rio forced a tight smile. “Thanks for having me.”</p><p>“And you are?” the man asked, glancing at Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” she said, her voice steady. “I’m here as Ms. Vidal’s advisor.”</p><p>The man frowned. “Ms. Vidal is a journalism student. I don’t believe she requires legal counsel.”</p><p>“She doesn’t,” Agatha said, her tone razor-sharp. “But I’m a law student with a strong understanding of defamation and First Amendment rights. I thought my presence might expedite this discussion.”</p><p>Rio smirked, hiding her amusement as the administrators exchanged uneasy glances.</p><p>The meeting began with the administrators outlining their concerns: the article’s “tone,” the potential impact on the university’s reputation, and whether Rio had obtained proper permissions for certain interviews.</p><p>Agatha listened silently, taking notes. When they finally paused, she leaned forward.</p><p>“First,” she began, her voice calm but commanding, “let’s address the issue of permissions. Ms. Vidal conducted her interviews in public spaces and obtained consent from every participant. I have documentation here if you’d like to review it.”</p><p>The man who had spoken earlier shifted uncomfortably. “That won’t be necessary.”</p><p>“Second,” Agatha continued, “the article’s tone is irrelevant. Ms. Vidal’s job as a journalist is to report the truth, not to frame it in a way that flatters the university.”</p><p>“And third,” Rio added, finding her voice, “if the university’s reputation is damaged by this article, maybe that says more about the administration than my writing.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a warning look, but there was a flicker of approval in her eyes.</p><p>The administrators exchanged glances again, their confidence clearly shaken.</p><p>The meeting ended with a begrudging agreement: the article would remain published, but Rio would include a brief editor’s note clarifying her sources.</p><p>As they left the building, Rio let out a sigh of relief. “That went better than I expected.”</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Agatha said, smirking.</p><p>Rio laughed. “Okay, fine. You were amazing in there. Seriously, Harkness, you should go into litigation. You’d scare the hell out of people.”</p><p>“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Agatha said. “Now, let’s go. I’m starving.”</p><p>That evening, they ordered takeout and sat on the living room floor, surrounded by empty cartons and scattered papers.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, raising her drink, “to the best damn roommate-slash-lawyer on campus.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but clinked her glass against Rio’s. “To not getting sued.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Same thing.”</p><p>They ate in comfortable silence for a while, the tension of the day fading away. Finally, Rio spoke.</p><p>“Thanks for having my back today,” she said, her voice softer than usual. “I don’t think I could’ve done it without you.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, surprised by the sincerity in her tone. “You could have. But I’m glad you didn’t have to.”</p><p>Rio smiled, and for a moment, the usual banter between them was replaced by something quieter, something unspoken.</p><p>That night, as Agatha sat in her room, she found herself thinking about Rio’s smile—how genuine it had been, how rare it was to see her let her guard down. And for the first time, she wondered if maybe, just maybe, there was more to their connection than she was willing to admit.</p><p>Rio, meanwhile, sat on the balcony with her laptop, a fresh draft open in front of her. She smiled as she typed, her thoughts clearer than they had been in weeks. And though she’d never admit it, she knew exactly who she had to thank for that.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Wanda Maximoff arrived at Agatha’s apartment with a duffel bag over her shoulder and a mischievous glint in her eye. She was early—on purpose. Agatha’s birthday was tomorrow, and as her best friend since childhood, Wanda had decided it was time to remind her to loosen up and celebrate herself for once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What Wanda didn’t anticipate was being greeted by someone who was most definitely not Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda knocked once, then twice, before the door finally swung open to reveal a woman with dark, choppy hair and a half-eaten granola bar in hand. She was wearing an oversized hoodie and looked more surprised than Wanda felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, hi?” the woman said, leaning against the doorframe. “Can I help you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who are you?” Wanda asked, narrowing her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I live here,” the woman replied, chewing on her granola bar. “Who are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m Wanda,” she said, crossing her arms. “Agatha’s best friend. And you are?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” the woman said with a smirk. “Agatha’s roommate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyebrows shot up. “You’re Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” Wanda said quickly, though her tone suggested otherwise. She stepped inside, dropping her bag by the door. “Where’s Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Library,” Rio said, closing the door behind her. “She practically lives there. But hey, make yourself at home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda surveyed the apartment, her sharp eyes taking in the mismatched furniture, the scattered books, and the faint scent of coffee lingering in the air. It was...chaotic. Just like the woman in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not what I expected,” Wanda said finally.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Good. Expectations are boring.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a brief exchange of pleasantries (if they could be called that), Wanda sat on the couch while Rio fiddled with her laptop. Wanda tapped her chin, glancing at Rio thoughtfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Wanda said, breaking the silence. “What do you know about Agatha’s birthday?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up, frowning. “It’s tomorrow, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” Wanda said. “And what do you have planned?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “Uh...nothing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda groaned, throwing her head back. “Of course she didn’t tell you. She’s probably pretending it’s not a big deal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not a big deal,” Rio said with a shrug. “It’s just a birthday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Wanda said, leaning forward. “It’s Agatha’s birthday. And trust me, she deserves a celebration, even if she won’t admit it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “And you want me to...what? Throw her a party?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not just a party,” Wanda said, a wicked grin spreading across her face. “A surprise party.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted. “You think Agatha will like that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’ll hate it at first,” Wanda admitted. “But deep down? She’ll love it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back, crossing her arms. “Why do I get the feeling you’ve done this before?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because I have,” Wanda said proudly. “And you’re going to help me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Agatha arrived home the next evening, the apartment was completely transformed. Balloons and streamers decorated the walls, a chocolate cake sat on the table, and a small group of friends and classmates mingled in the living room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Surprise!” everyone shouted as Agatha opened the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, her eyes wide as she took in the scene. For a moment, she looked genuinely stunned. Then her gaze landed on Wanda, who was grinning like a Cheshire cat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda,” Agatha said, her voice flat. “What is this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s your birthday, dummy,” Wanda said, walking over to hug her. “Did you really think I’d let it go uncelebrated?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, though there was a faint smile tugging at her lips. “You’re impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Wanda said proudly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze shifted to Rio, who was standing by the cake, holding a drink. “And you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “Blame her,” she said, gesturing to Wanda. “I just followed orders.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, but her smile grew. “You’re both ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was just beginning to relax when she spotted Sam, Rio’s date from the other night, chatting animatedly with Rio near the kitchen. Sam leaned in, laughing at something Rio said, and Rio’s grin widened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mood soured instantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, ever perceptive, noticed the shift in her best friend’s demeanor. She followed Agatha’s line of sight and smirked. “Oh, this is interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha said, feigning innocence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re staring,” Wanda said, her voice teasing. “At Rio and her...friend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not staring,” Agatha said quickly, turning away. “I’m observing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh-huh,” Wanda said, crossing her arms. “And why do you look like you want to set that girl on fire?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glared at her. “I don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You do,” Wanda said, grinning. “Agatha Harkness, are you jealous?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha snapped, her tone a little too sharp. “Don’t be ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda laughed. “You’re so bad at lying. Must be a huge disadvantage in the courtroom”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Even if I were—which I’m not—it doesn’t matter. Rio can date whoever she wants.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure,” Wanda said, clearly unconvinced. “But that doesn’t mean you like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond, her gaze drifting back to Rio and Sam. Wanda followed her line of sight again, her grin widening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax,” Wanda said, patting Agatha on the shoulder. “She’s just talking to her. It’s not the end of the world.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not a big deal,” Agatha muttered, though the tension in her shoulders said otherwise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, never one to leave well enough alone, decided it was time to stir the pot. She sidled up to Rio and Sam, interrupting their conversation with a cheery smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi, Sam, right?” Wanda said, extending her hand. “I’m Wanda. Agatha’s best friend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice to meet you,” Sam said, shaking her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Wanda said, glancing at Rio, “what’s it like living with Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s...an experience,” Rio said, her tone amused. “She’s a bit of a control freak, but she means well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smirked. “Sounds about right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze shifted to Sam. “And how do you two know each other?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just met recently,” Sam said, smiling. “Rio’s...interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s one word for it,” Wanda said, her tone light but pointed. She caught Rio’s eye and raised an eyebrow, silently daring her to respond.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, sensing the shift in Wanda’s tone, cleared her throat. “Anyway, I should check on the cake.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure,” Wanda said, watching her retreat with a satisfied smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later, as the party wound down and most of the guests left, Agatha found herself alone in the kitchen with Wanda.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Wanda said, leaning against the counter. “You want to tell me what’s really going on?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?” Agatha asked, though she knew exactly what Wanda was talking about.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Wanda said, her tone serious. “You’re jealous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not,” Agatha insisted, though her voice lacked conviction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Wanda said, shrugging. “Then answer this: Why does it bother you so much when Rio’s with someone else?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her mind racing for an answer she didn’t want to admit. Finally, she sighed. “It doesn’t matter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It does,” Wanda said softly. “And you know it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t reply, staring down at her glass instead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda placed a hand on her shoulder, her voice gentle. “Look, whatever this is...just figure it out. For your sake. And hers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha lay in bed that night, her mind raced with Wanda’s words. She wasn’t ready to admit what she was feeling, not even to herself. But deep down, she knew Wanda was right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For Rio, the party was a success—but as she cleaned up the apartment, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. And though she couldn’t explain why, she found herself glancing at Agatha’s door, wondering what she was thinking.</span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The next morning</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha woke up the next morning, the soft glow of sunlight streaming through her window, she couldn’t ignore the warmth in her chest left over from last night’s party.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stretched and rolled out of bed, intending to start her day as usual. But when she entered the living room, she found the apartment unusually quiet. No music, no clatter of keyboards, no Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, there was a note on the kitchen counter, neatly folded and propped up against a small package wrapped in plain brown paper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha picked up the note, frowning slightly. It was written in Rio’s sharp, messy handwriting.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Had to leave early for classwork—working on the next article. Didn’t want to wake you. Happy Birthday, Harkness. Don’t say I never do anything nice.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but a small smile tugged at the corners of her lips. Typical Rio, she thought. Even her kindness came with a side of sarcasm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze shifted to the package beneath the note. It was small but carefully wrapped, the edges folded with precision. Agatha hesitated for a moment, then untied the string and peeled back the paper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she saw what was inside, her breath caught.</span>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a first edition of The Wizard of Oz, its cover slightly worn but beautiful nonetheless. Agatha’s fingers brushed over the gold-embossed lettering, her heart pounding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The book had been a favorite of hers as a child—one she’d read countless times, escaping into the whimsical world of Dorothy and her companions. She’d mentioned it to Wanda once, years ago, in passing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, she simply stared at the book, her mind racing. How did Rio know?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She opened the book carefully, the faint smell of aged paper filling the air, and flipped through the pages. Her chest tightened as she took in the illustrations and the meticulous detail of the printing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This book wasn’t just a story. It was a piece of her childhood—a world she had escaped to when things felt overwhelming, a place where the impossible seemed possible. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze snapped back to the note.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How?” she whispered to the empty apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat down at the table, the book still in her hands. She hated how much her thoughts were spinning, how unsettled she felt. Rio wasn’t the sentimental type. She wasn’t the kind of person who gave perfect gifts or paid attention to tiny details.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Was she?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thumb grazed over the spine, her heart pounding. The note replayed in her mind: </span>
<em>
<span>Don’t say I never do anything nice.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“This isn’t just nice,” Agatha muttered to herself. “It’s... too much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her chest tightened further, a mix of gratitude and confusion swelling inside her. And maybe, if she were honest with herself, something warmer, something closer to affection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of a door creaking broke her reverie. Wanda stumbled out of the guest room, still half-asleep, her scarlet hair a mess.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning,” Wanda mumbled, rubbing her eyes. “What’s with the serious face?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned the book toward her. “This.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda blinked, stepping closer. When she saw the title, her eyes widened. “Is that—? Wait, who gave you this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha said, her voice quieter than usual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s surprise turned into a knowing grin. “And here I thought she wasn’t the sentimental type.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha set the book down, crossing her arms. “You told her, didn’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “Told her what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That I liked this book,” Agatha said, gesturing to the gift. “That it was important to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t,” Wanda said, holding up her hands. “I swear. I didn’t even know she was planning to get you anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned, unconvinced. “Then how did she know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” Wanda said, smirking. “Maybe your roommate pays more attention than you think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Rio doesn’t pay attention to anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Clearly, she does,” Wanda said, nodding toward the book. “Come on, Agatha. This isn’t a random gift. She had to put thought into it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, glancing at the book again. She didn’t want to admit it, but Wanda had a point.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda leaned against the counter, watching Agatha carefully. “You like her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze. “Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You like her,” Wanda repeated, her tone matter-of-fact. “And don’t even try to deny it. I’ve seen the way you look at her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> “I don’t—” Agatha started, but Wanda cut her off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, you do,” Wanda said, crossing her arms. “You’re jealous when she’s with other people, you get all flustered when she’s around, and now you’re obsessing over this gift. Face it, Harkness. You’re into her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her, speechless. She wanted to argue, to insist that Wanda was wrong. But the words wouldn’t come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s expression softened. “Look, it’s not a bad thing. Rio’s...different, sure. But she clearly cares about you. Why else would she go out of her way to find something this perfect?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at the book, her chest tightening. “It doesn’t matter. Even if I did feel something, she’s not...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not what?” Wanda asked gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Interested,” Agatha said, her voice barely above a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shook her head. “You don’t know that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda left the room to shower, leaving Agatha alone with her thoughts. She sat down at the table, the book still in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She thought about the way Rio had smiled at her during the party, the way she always managed to make her laugh even when she was annoyed, the way she’d defended her article with unshakable determination.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She thought about the note Rio had left, the teasing but warm tone that felt so distinctly hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now, this gift.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, resting her head in her hands. She hated how much Rio got under her skin, how much she made her question things she thought she’d buried long ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But maybe Wanda was right. Maybe it wasn’t such a bad thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Wanda returned, her hair still damp, she found Agatha sitting on the couch, staring at the book.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Wanda asked, sitting beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly. “I don’t know what to do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“About what?” Wanda asked, though she clearly knew the answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“About her,” Agatha admitted. “She’s infuriating, chaotic, and completely opposite of everything I want in my life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet?” Wanda prompted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet she’s...” Agatha trailed off, struggling to find the words. “She’s...Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smiled. “Exactly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> Agatha looked at her, confused. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It means,” Wanda said, leaning back, “she’s not who you expected, but maybe that’s a good thing. You don’t always have to have everything figured out, Agatha. Sometimes, the best things come out of chaos.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned, considering her words. “Since when are you so wise?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Since always,” Wanda said with a wink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the morning passed quietly, with Wanda stealing glances at Agatha as she flipped through the pages of her new book. It was clear her best friend was lost in thought, and for once, Wanda didn’t push.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha sat there, her fingers tracing the edges of the worn cover, she couldn’t help but wonder where Rio was, what she was doing, and why this gift felt like so much more than just a birthday present.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t have answers yet, but for the first time in a long time, she was willing to let herself think about the questions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That afternoon, as Wanda prepared to head out for errands, she turned to Agatha with a smirk. “You should thank her when she gets back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at her, rolling her eyes. “I will.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And maybe,” Wanda added, her tone teasing, “you should tell her how you feel.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond, but the faint blush on her cheeks said enough.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Later that day</span>

</p><p>
<span>Agatha came out of her room and walked to the living room setting the book down and crossed her arms, watching Rio as she casually sipped her coffee like she hadn’t just turned Agatha’s world upside down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you know?” Agatha asked, her voice sharper than she intended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, leaning back against the counter. “Know what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That The Wizard of Oz was important to me,” Agatha said, gesturing toward the book on the coffee table. “I don’t remember telling you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, the corners of her mouth twitching upward. “You’re acting like I cracked some secret code. It’s not that deep, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “You don’t strike me as the type to guess sentimental details.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe you underestimate me,” Rio said, setting her coffee down and crossing her arms to mirror Agatha’s stance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or maybe,” Agatha said, taking a step closer, “you overheard something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Possible,” Rio admitted, her tone casual. “You’re not exactly subtle when you talk about books.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. That answer was plausible, but something about it felt off. She could count the number of times she’d mentioned The Wizard of Oz aloud, and none of those moments had been in Rio’s presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Care to elaborate?” Agatha pressed, her voice edged with suspicion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, a flicker of something unreadable crossing her face. “Look, you’re always going on about how books are more than just stories, how they connect to people’s lives, blah, blah, blah. I figured this one mattered to you. Lucky guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A lucky guess?” Agatha repeated, disbelief dripping from her words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk returned, but it was softer now, almost teasing. “Don’t make it weird, Harkness. It’s just a birthday gift. You’re allowed to like it without turning it into an interrogation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to argue but hesitated. She couldn’t tell if Rio was being sincere or deflecting. Her words were casual, but there was something in her tone—something quieter, almost vulnerable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re impossible,” Agatha muttered, turning away and picking up the book again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re welcome,” Rio called after her, her voice tinged with amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had just made a snack and sat back down on the couch, the book resting in her lap. She flipped through the pages absentmindedly, her mind racing. The more she thought about it, the more the pieces didn’t add up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t sentimental. She wasn’t someone who paid close attention to other people’s preferences, let alone their childhood memories. And yet, this gift felt so...specific.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers traced the embossed title on the cover, the gold letters gleaming faintly in the light. How could Rio have known? Agatha glanced back at the kitchen, where Rio was now rummaging through the fridge, completely unbothered by the conversation they’d just had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you go out of your way to find this?” Agatha asked suddenly, breaking the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio straightened, a carton of milk in her hand. “What if I did?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused, as if considering her answer. Then, with a shrug, she said, “Because you deserve something good for once. Happy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest tightened. She hated how Rio could say things like that so easily, as if they didn’t mean anything—and maybe they didn’t. But to Agatha, the words lingered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t...” Agatha started, then shook her head. “You didn’t have to do this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio said, her voice quieter now. She poured herself a glass of milk and leaned against the counter, meeting Agatha’s gaze. “But I wanted to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a lump form in her throat, but she swallowed it down. She didn’t know how to respond to that—not without saying something she wasn’t ready to admit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she simply said, “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk returned, but this time it was softer, almost shy. “Don’t mention it, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her for a moment longer, then turned her attention back to the book. She didn’t know what to make of Rio or the gift or the way her heart seemed to beat faster every time Rio smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For now, it was easier to focus on the pages in front of her. But the questions remained, swirling in her mind like a storm she couldn’t control.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>A couple of days after her birthday gift and the cryptic exchange with Rio, Agatha Harkness found herself unsettled. The book still rested on her coffee table, its presence a quiet but persistent reminder of the gesture that had caught her completely off guard.</p><p>Wanda had left for the day, promising to return later, and Rio was back at her laptop, headphones on, typing furiously. For someone who often radiated chaos, Rio looked oddly peaceful when she worked. Agatha hated how much she noticed that.</p><p>Agatha needed tea. It was a necessity, not an excuse to leave the couch and avoid looking at Rio for another minute. She padded into the kitchen, determined to focus on something other than the woman currently occupying more of her thoughts than she cared to admit.</p><p>As she reached for the kettle, her gaze fell on a stack of papers sitting on the counter. They were scattered, not haphazardly but in that deliberate way that hinted at Rio’s organized mess. Curious, Agatha leaned closer and saw the title at the top of the page:</p><p>“The Price of Silence: A Campus in Crisis”</p><p>Her brow furrowed as she scanned the first few lines. It was a draft of Rio’s next article, sharp and unflinching, detailing the impact of the university’s budget cuts on underfunded student programs. The tone was passionate, almost fiery, and there was a vulnerability to it that made Agatha pause.</p><p>“You snooping, Harkness?” Rio’s voice cut through her thoughts.</p><p>Agatha flinched, straightening as Rio entered the kitchen. “I wasn’t snooping. You left it out.”</p><p>Rio smirked, leaning against the doorway. “Sure you weren’t.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, ignoring the warmth creeping up her neck. “It’s good. Better than good, actually. You’re...really talented.”</p><p>The smirk faltered, replaced by something softer. “Thanks. Means a lot coming from you.”</p><p>Agatha shifted uncomfortably, unsure how to handle the sincerity in Rio’s tone. “Why didn’t you say anything about this?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, opening the fridge. “Didn’t think you’d be interested.”</p><p>“I’m interested,” Agatha said quietly, surprising even herself.</p><p>Rio glanced at her, something unreadable flickering across her face. “Noted.”</p><p>That evening, Agatha found herself sitting on the balcony, the cool night air brushing against her skin. Rio joined her a few minutes later, a beer in hand and a distant look in her eyes.</p><p>“Long day?” Agatha asked, breaking the silence.</p><p>“Something like that,” Rio replied, taking a sip.</p><p>Agatha studied her, noting the tension in her shoulders, the way her usual sharpness seemed dulled. It was rare to see Rio anything but confident and carefree, and the contrast unsettled her.</p><p>“Do you ever feel like you’re running out of time?” Rio asked suddenly, her voice quiet.</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean...life,” Rio said, gesturing vaguely. “Like, no matter how much you do, it’s never enough. There’s always something bigger, something better, something just out of reach.”</p><p>Agatha was silent for a moment, unsure how to respond. “I think everyone feels that way sometimes.”</p><p>Rio snorted softly. “Even you, Ms. Perfectly Organized?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then admitted, “Especially me.”</p><p>Rio turned to look at her, surprised. “Really?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her gaze drifting to the skyline. “I have plans for everything—my career, my future—but sometimes it feels like I’m just...checking boxes. Like I’m waiting for something to actually matter.”</p><p>Rio didn’t reply immediately, but her expression softened. “I get that.”</p><p>They sat in silence for a while, the unspoken understanding between them heavier than the words they hadn’t said.</p><p>The next day, Agatha returned to the apartment after a long day of classes to find a cup of tea waiting for her on the counter. The sight stopped her in her tracks.</p><p>Rio was sprawled on the couch, flipping through her notes. She didn’t look up as Agatha approached.</p><p>“What’s this?” Agatha asked, holding up the mug.</p><p>Rio shrugged. “You looked like you needed it.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, the simplicity of the gesture striking in a way she couldn’t quite explain. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Don’t get used to it,” Rio said, smirking.</p><p>But as Agatha took a sip, she couldn’t help but think that maybe she already had.</p><p>Later that evening, Wanda burst into the apartment, her energy filling the room as usual. She dropped her bag by the door and plopped onto the couch beside Agatha.</p><p>“Miss me?” Wanda asked, grinning.</p><p>“Not particularly,” Agatha replied, though her lips twitched into a smile.</p><p>Wanda’s gaze flicked to Rio, who was sitting cross-legged on the floor, her laptop open. “How’s the chaos demon?”</p><p>“Still here,” Rio said without looking up.</p><p>“Good,” Wanda said, smirking. “Because I need a second opinion.”</p><p>“On what?” Agatha asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“On this,” Wanda said, holding up her phone. It was a photo from the party—a candid shot of Agatha and Rio standing near the table, mid-conversation. Rio was laughing, her head tilted back slightly, while Agatha looked surprisingly relaxed, a faint smile on her lips.</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Why do you even have that?”</p><p>“Because it’s adorable,” Wanda said matter-of-factly. “And because it proves my point.”</p><p>“What point?” Agatha asked warily.</p><p>“That you two have...a vibe,” Wanda said, wiggling her eyebrows.</p><p>Agatha groaned, covering her face with her hands. “I don’t have time for this.”</p><p>“You make time,” Wanda said, leaning closer. “Seriously, Agatha. When are you going to admit it?”</p><p>“There’s nothing to admit,” Agatha said, her voice muffled by her hands.</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes. “Right. Keep telling yourself that.You’re falling for her, and it’s terrifying you”</p><p>That night, long after Wanda had gone to bed, Agatha sat on the couch, staring at the now-empty mug Rio had made for her. The apartment was silent, save for the faint hum of the refrigerator.</p><p>Agatha sighed, her thoughts a tangled mess. She didn’t know what to make of Rio—the gift, the tea, the quiet moments that seemed to mean so much more than either of them was willing to say.</p><p>All she knew was that Rio made her feel something she hadn’t felt in a long time: alive, unsure, and entirely out of control.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, she didn’t hate it.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her phone, her chest tightening as she opened her gallery. She looked at the photo Wanda had taken at the party.</p><p>There was something unspoken in the photo—something Agatha couldn’t put into words but felt deeply every time she looked at it.</p><p>A spark.</p><p>Agatha set her phone down on the coffee table, her heart pounding. Wanda’s words from earlier played over in her mind:</p><p>
<em>"You’re falling for her, and it’s terrifying you."</em>
</p><p>Agatha had denied it at the time, scoffing and brushing Wanda off with her usual sarcasm. But now, sitting alone in the quiet of the apartment, she couldn’t run from the truth.</p><p>She was falling for Rio.</p><p>It wasn’t logical or practical, and it certainly wasn’t something she’d planned. But it was there, undeniable and persistent, clawing at her every time Rio smiled, laughed, or did something so infuriatingly Rio.</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath, her fingers tightening around the book in her lap. She couldn’t keep avoiding it. Not after everything.</p><p>She had to tell Rio how she felt.</p><p>The sound of the apartment door opening shattered Agatha’s thoughts, and she glanced up, her heart leaping into her throat. For a moment, she thought it was fate—Rio, coming home just as she’d mustered the courage to say something.</p><p>But then she saw the figure beside Rio, and her stomach dropped.</p><p>Rio stumbled inside, her arm draped lazily over the shoulder of a tall, red-haired woman. Both of them were laughing, their voices too loud for the late hour. The woman leaned closer, whispering something in Rio’s ear that made her grin wickedly.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught as she watched them. The woman’s hand rested on Rio’s waist, and Rio didn’t pull away. If anything, she leaned in closer, their movements intimate and easy.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, noticing Agatha for the first time. Her voice was slurred, her cheeks flushed from the alcohol. “Didn’t think you’d still be up, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, her composure slipping. “Clearly.”</p><p>Rio smirked, glancing at the woman beside her. “This is...uh, Tess. Tess, this is Agatha. My...roommate.”</p><p>Tess offered a half-hearted smile, her attention clearly more focused on Rio than the conversation. “Nice to meet you.”</p><p>Agatha forced a polite nod, her fingers gripping the edge of the book in her lap. “Charmed.”</p><p>Agatha turned back to the book, though she couldn’t read a single word. Her mind was racing, her chest tight with emotions she couldn’t name but felt all at once: anger, jealousy, frustration.</p><p>She heard the soft murmur of voices as Rio and Tess moved toward the hallway. Agatha clenched her jaw, her grip on the book tightening.</p><p>“Don’t wait up,” Rio called over her shoulder, her voice teasing.</p><p>And with that, the door to Rio’s room closed, leaving Agatha alone in the silence once again.</p><p>She stared at the book in her hands, her vision blurring as tears pricked the corners of her eyes. Her earlier resolve felt foolish now, her decision to confess her feelings laughably naive.</p><p>What had she been thinking? That Rio would suddenly feel the same way? That the chaotic, unpredictable woman who drove her insane could ever want something real with her?</p><p>Agatha let out a bitter laugh, setting the book down on the coffee table with trembling hands. She felt stupid—stupid for caring, stupid for hoping, stupid for thinking she could let herself be vulnerable.</p><p>Her phone buzzed with a new message, but she didn’t look at it. She already knew what it was: another picture from Wanda, another reminder of something that wasn’t real.</p><p>Agatha stood, her movements rigid, and headed for her room. She needed space—distance from the apartment, from her emotions, from Rio. But as she closed her door behind her, the pain in her chest didn’t ease.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">The morning light filtered through the apartment windows, casting a soft glow on the living room. Agatha Harkness sat at the kitchen table, her phone pressed to her ear, her fingers drumming anxiously against the wood. She had been up since dawn, unable to shake the events of the previous night.</p><p dir="ltr">Her phone call to her mother hadn’t been planned. Evanora Harkness rarely called unless she wanted something, and birthdays—Agatha’s or otherwise—were hardly high on her list of priorities. But this morning, to Agatha’s surprise, her mother’s name had flashed on her screen.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha,” Evanora’s clipped voice greeted her. “I realized I forgot to call on your birthday. Happy belated, or whatever.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s stomach twisted. The words were perfunctory, devoid of warmth or sincerity. “Wow, thanks for the heartfelt message.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t be dramatic,” Evanora said sharply. “I’m calling now, aren’t I?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Sure,” Agatha said, her tone cold. “Only a few days late. How thoughtful of you.”</p><p dir="ltr">The conversation, strained from the start, quickly devolved into familiar territory. Evanora’s barbed comments struck like arrows, each one laced with disappointment or disdain.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, excuse me for having a life,” Evanora said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “Not all of us can sit around reading books and pretending we’re better than everyone else.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s grip on the phone tightened. “I don’t pretend to be better than anyone. But at least I’m not calling my daughter out of obligation, days late, and acting like I deserve a medal for it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Watch your tone,” Evanora snapped. “You’ve always had a nasty streak, you know that? Just like when you were a child. Always so difficult, so unruly. I don’t know how I tolerated you.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Tolerated me?” Agatha’s voice rose, her chest heaving. “Do you even hear yourself? You didn’t ‘tolerate’ me—you controlled me, criticized me, and made me feel like I was never enough!”</p><p dir="ltr">“Because you weren’t enough,” Evanora said coldly. “You were a messy, chaotic child who needed discipline, and I gave it to you. Maybe you should be thanking me.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Thanking you?” Agatha’s voice cracked, her vision blurring with unshed tears. “For what? For making me afraid to be myself? For punishing me for every little mistake? For teaching me that love only comes with conditions?”</p><p dir="ltr">Evanora’s response was a scoff, followed by a sharp, “Don’t be ridiculous, Agatha. Stop playing the victim.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m not playing anything!” Agatha shouted, her voice echoing through the apartment. “I’m finally telling the truth, something you’ve never been capable of handling.”</p><p dir="ltr">The silence on the other end of the line was deafening. Finally, Evanora said, her tone icy, “You’ll regret this attitude one day, Agatha. Don’t call me when you do.”</p><p dir="ltr">The line went dead.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha stared at her phone, her hands shaking as the weight of the conversation settled over her. Her chest ached, and the tears she’d been holding back threatened to spill. But she refused to let them. Not now. Not here.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha?” Wanda’s voice came from behind her, soft and tentative.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha turned sharply, realizing her yelling had woken both Wanda and Rio. They stood in the doorway, Wanda in her pajamas, Rio looking slightly disheveled but alert.</p><p dir="ltr">“Are you okay?” Wanda asked, stepping closer.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m fine,” Agatha said curtly, though her trembling voice betrayed her. She grabbed her bag from the counter, avoiding their concerned gazes. “I’m going to the library.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha, wait—” Wanda started, but Agatha was already moving toward the door.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t want to talk about it,” Agatha mumbled, her voice cracking. She glanced briefly at Rio, her expression unreadable. “I’ll be back later.”</p><p dir="ltr">With that, she was gone, the door closing firmly behind her.</p><p dir="ltr">The silence in the apartment was thick as Rio and Wanda stood in the wake of Agatha’s stormy departure. Rio crossed her arms, her brow furrowed. “What the hell was that about?”</p><p dir="ltr">Wanda sighed, running a hand through her scarlet hair. “Her mother.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio raised an eyebrow. “Evanora?”</p><p dir="ltr">Wanda nodded, her expression darkening. “Evanora Harkness is...not a good person. She’s emotionally abusive, manipulative, and a control freak to the core.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio leaned against the counter, her frown deepening. “What did she do?”</p><p dir="ltr">Wanda hesitated, then said, “Everything, really. She made Agatha’s life hell growing up. If Agatha made a mess as a kid, she was punished. If she cried, she was punished. If she dared to push back, she was punished. Evanora wanted a perfect child, and when Agatha didn’t fit into her mold, she beat the chaos out of her.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s stomach twisted. “You mean...literally?”</p><p dir="ltr">Wanda nodded grimly. “Not all the time, but often enough. And the rest of the time, it was emotional. Evanora would withhold affection, criticize everything Agatha did, make her feel like she wasn’t good enough. It’s why Agatha is the way she is now—controlled, rigid, terrified of making a mistake.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio let out a slow breath, the weight of Wanda’s words settling heavily on her. She thought back to their fight, the harsh words they’d exchanged, and guilt gnawed at her. “I didn’t know.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Of course you didn’t,” Wanda said, her tone softer now. “She doesn’t talk about it. But you’ve seen her, haven’t you? How hard she works to keep everything perfect? That’s her way of surviving. She thinks if she controls everything, nothing can hurt her.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio nodded, her mind racing. She had always thought of Agatha as tough, unflappable, even cold at times. But now, those walls didn’t seem so impenetrable. And the thought of what it had taken to build them made her heart ache.</p><p dir="ltr">Wanda studied Rio for a moment, her expression thoughtful. “You’ve noticed, haven’t you? How hard she works to keep everything together?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio nodded slowly. “I thought it was just...her personality. I didn’t realize it was survival.”</p><p dir="ltr">Wanda smiled faintly. “Now you know. But Agatha doesn’t talk about this stuff. She’s not going to let you in unless she thinks you’re worth it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio looked at Wanda, something soft and uncertain flickering in her eyes. “You think I am?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I think you could be,” Wanda said, her tone kind but firm. </p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the week had passed quietly. Too quietly. Agatha had spent most of her time in the library or at Wanda’s, Rio focusing on her work or going out at parties and not coming back until Agatha was out of the house.</p><p dir="ltr">But the tension between them had been simmering for days—unspoken words and sidelong glances building into something neither of them could ignore.</p><p dir="ltr">It began with a small, familiar irritation. Agatha was seated at the dining table, her notes meticulously spread out in front of her. The legal case she was researching required complete focus, and she was determined to meet her self-imposed deadline.</p><p dir="ltr">But Rio’s voice broke through the silence like a wrecking ball.</p><p dir="ltr">“No, seriously,” Rio said into her phone as she walked into the kitchen. “I told you, I’ll have it by tomorrow. What’s the rush?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha closed her eyes, trying to block out the sound.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, I get it,” Rio continued, her voice growing louder. “But you’ve got to chill. Deadlines aren’t life or death.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s jaw tightened. She gripped her pen harder, forcing herself to focus on the case law in front of her.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed, an easy, carefree sound that grated on Agatha’s already frayed nerves.</p><p dir="ltr">“Do you mind?” Agatha snapped, finally looking up from her notes.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio glanced at her, an eyebrow raised. “What’s your problem?”</p><p dir="ltr">“My problem,” Agatha said, her tone sharp, “is that I’m trying to work, and you’re being loud enough to wake the dead.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio rolled her eyes, ending her call abruptly. “Sorry, didn’t realize the entire apartment was your personal library.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It wouldn’t have to be if you had even an ounce of consideration,” Agatha shot back, crossing her arms.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio leaned against the counter, her smirk fading. “Oh, give me a break. I live here too, you know.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha stood, her voice rising. “Then act like it! You treat this place like your personal playground—your mess, your noise, your constant chaos.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s eyes narrowed. “I clean up after myself, and I’m not that loud.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re impossible to live with,” Agatha continued, her frustration spilling over. “You’re reckless, inconsiderate, and you think the rules don’t apply to you.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Rules?” Rio said, laughing bitterly. “You mean your rules? Just because you’re obsessed with control doesn’t mean everyone else has to be.”</p><p dir="ltr">“At least I’m not a selfish child who runs away from anything remotely serious,” Agatha shot back, her words cutting deeper than she intended.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio flinched, the sharpness in her expression faltering. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha hesitated, but the anger and jealousy bubbling inside her pushed her forward. “You’re always running, Rio. From responsibilities, from people who care about you, from anything that might actually require you to grow up. Maybe that’s why you’re so scared to let anyone get too close.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s jaw tightened, her fists clenched at her sides. “You don’t know a damn thing about me.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t I?” Agatha said, stepping closer. “You think I haven’t noticed? You flit from person to person—Sam, your other little ‘dates, Tess was her name? And Chloe? Brianne? But you never let anyone stay. What are you so afraid of?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s expression darkened. “This isn’t about me. This is about you, Agatha. You’re just jealous because for once, someone’s not falling all over themselves to please you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s face flushed, her chest tightening. “I am not jealous.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Then why are you so obsessed with what I do or who I’m with?” Rio snapped. “It’s none of your business.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It is when it disrupts my life,” Agatha said coldly. “You’re reckless, Rio. And maybe that’s why—” She stopped herself, but the words were already there, hanging unspoken in the air.</p><p dir="ltr">“Why what?” Rio demanded, her voice dangerously low.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha swallowed hard. “Forget it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“No,” Rio said, stepping closer. “Say it. You’ve got all these opinions about me—why don’t you just spit it out?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha hesitated, then finally said, “Maybe that’s why you’re so good at pushing people away. It’s easier than admitting you don’t know how to hold onto them.”</p><p dir="ltr">The room went silent. Rio stared at her, the weight of Agatha’s words sinking in.</p><p dir="ltr">“Wow,” Rio said, her voice quiet but trembling with anger. “You know, I thought you were different. But you’re just like everyone else—judging me without knowing the first thing about who I am or what I’ve been through.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I wouldn’t have to if you weren’t so...chaotic all the time,” Agatha shot back.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s expression darkened. “Chaotic? You mean not boring and uptight like you?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s jaw tightened. “At least I have my life together.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Really?” Rio said, stepping closer. “Because from where I’m standing, you’re just hiding behind your rules and schedules because you’re too scared to actually feel something.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s breath caught, her chest tightening as the words hit their mark. “That’s not true.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Isn’t it?” Rio challenged, her voice softer but no less sharp. “You push everyone away too, Agatha. You act like you’re better than me, but you’re just...scared.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her voice icy. “And you’re reckless. You don’t think about anyone but yourself.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio flinched, her anger faltering for a moment. Then she scoffed, grabbing her bag from the counter. “You know what? Forget it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but Rio shook her head, grabbing her bag from the counter.</p><p dir="ltr">“Forget it,” Rio said, her voice breaking slightly. “You’re not worth it.”</p><p dir="ltr">The door slammed behind her, the sound reverberating through the apartment. Agatha stood there, the anger draining from her as guilt and regret crept in.</p><p dir="ltr">She sank back into her chair, her heart pounding. She’d crossed a line, and she knew it. But what scared her more than the fight was the truth in Rio’s words.</p><p dir="ltr">She was jealous. And for the first time, she couldn’t hide from it.</p><p dir="ltr">The apartment was unusually quiet when Wanda arrived later that evening. As she pushed open the door, she immediately noticed Agatha sitting on the couch, her arms crossed tightly over her chest, staring blankly at the muted TV screen.</p><p dir="ltr">“Okay,” Wanda said, dropping her bag by the door and stepping into the room. “What happened?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Nothing,” Agatha replied sharply, not looking at her.</p><p dir="ltr">Wanda raised an eyebrow, slipping off her jacket and tossing it over the back of a chair. “Yeah, no. That tone screams something.” She plopped down beside Agatha, tilting her head to study her best friend. “Spill.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha sighed, her fingers twitching where they rested on her arms. “It’s nothing, Wanda. Just a disagreement with Rio.”</p><p dir="ltr">Wanda smirked knowingly. “A disagreement? Knowing you two, it was probably a volcanic eruption.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha groaned. “It’s not funny.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, it’s a little funny,” Wanda said, leaning back. “Come on, what was it about this time? The thermostat? The mess? Her music?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha hesitated, her jaw tightening. “I might have...said something.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Define ‘something,’” Wanda said, narrowing her eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">“I called her reckless and selfish,” Agatha admitted reluctantly. “And I may have...implied that her behavior was because she’s scared to let anyone close.”</p><p dir="ltr">Wanda’s mouth fell open. “Agatha!”</p><p dir="ltr">“What?” Agatha said defensively. “It’s true!”</p><p dir="ltr">“Even if it is,” Wanda said, shaking her head, “you can’t just say that to someone. Especially not Rio. She’s not exactly the type to brush that off.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha looked away, her arms tightening around herself. “She runs from everything, Wanda. It’s infuriating.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Okay, but why does it bother you so much?” Wanda asked, crossing her arms.</p><p dir="ltr">“Because it’s disruptive,” Agatha snapped. “She’s loud, she’s messy, she doesn’t respect boundaries—”</p><p dir="ltr">“Boundaries like dating someone who isn’t you?” Wanda interrupted, raising an eyebrow.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha froze, her words catching in her throat. “What are you talking about?”</p><p dir="ltr">“You know exactly what I’m talking about,” Wanda said, her voice softening. “This isn’t about boundaries or messes or even that she’s loud. You’re jealous, Agatha. Admit it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I am not jealous,” Agatha said quickly, though her tone lacked conviction.</p><p dir="ltr">Wanda tilted her head, her expression unreadable. “Then why do you care so much about what she does? Why do you care about Sam, or her dates, or how she lives her life? If it’s not jealousy, then what is it?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha didn’t answer. She stared down at her hands, her thoughts a jumbled mess.</p><p dir="ltr">“You like her,” Wanda said gently. “You’ve liked her for a while. And that’s okay, Agatha. But you need to stop pretending that this is just about being annoyed with her.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t—” Agatha started, but the words felt hollow even to her.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha,” Wanda said, her voice firm but kind. “You’re my best friend, and I know you better than anyone. You’re falling for her, and it’s terrifying you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha clenched her fists, her chest tightening. “It doesn’t matter. She’s with Sam, or whoever else. It doesn’t matter.”</p><p dir="ltr">Wanda frowned. “If it didn’t matter, you wouldn’t be this upset. You wouldn’t have said those things to her.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I was angry,” Agatha admitted, her voice quiet. “She said I was scared of feeling something, of letting people in.”</p><p dir="ltr">“And she’s right, isn’t she?” Wanda asked softly.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha exhaled shakily, leaning back against the couch. “I don’t know what I’m doing, Wanda. She makes me feel...completely unhinged.”</p><p dir="ltr">Wanda smiled faintly. “That’s because she’s the opposite of everything you’ve ever known. She challenges you, pushes you, makes you uncomfortable. And maybe, just maybe, that’s what you need.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha closed her eyes, the weight of Wanda’s words settling over her. “She left.”</p><p dir="ltr">“She’ll come back,” Wanda said, her voice reassuring. “But when she does, you need to figure out what you really want. Because whatever this is between you two, it’s not going to disappear on its own.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha didn’t respond, her thoughts too tangled to form a coherent reply. But deep down, she knew Wanda was right. Rio had shaken something loose in her, something she couldn’t ignore anymore.</p><p dir="ltr">Wanda leaned back, watching her best friend with a knowing look. “You’ve got a lot to figure out, Agatha. But for now, maybe just...apologize.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha sighed, running a hand through her hair. “You think she’ll listen?”</p><p dir="ltr">“She always listens to you,” Wanda said, smirking. “Even when she pretends not to.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha glanced at the door, her chest tightening again. She didn’t know how to fix this, but one thing was clear: she couldn’t lose Rio—not now, not ever.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha stayed awake longer than she should have, her thoughts spinning endlessly. The fight replayed in her head like a broken record, every sharp word and biting remark echoing louder in the silence of the apartment. She hated how things had ended, and more than that, she hated how much she missed Rio’s presence—even her infuriating, chaotic energy.</p><p dir="ltr">When the door finally opened, it was nearly midnight. Agatha sat up from her spot on the couch, her heart thudding as Rio stumbled inside, the unmistakable smell of alcohol wafting in with her.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio leaned heavily against the doorframe, her bag slipping from her shoulder to the floor. Her usually sharp eyes were glassy, her smirk sloppier than usual. “Oh, look,” Rio slurred, her voice mockingly cheerful. “It’s Her Highness.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s relief that Rio was safe was immediately overshadowed by fury. She stood, crossing her arms tightly over her chest. “Are you drunk?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Maybe,” Rio said with a shrug, kicking off her shoes. “What’s it to you?”</p><p dir="ltr">“What’s it to me?” Agatha snapped, stepping closer. “You’re stumbling in here at god knows what hour, and you think I’m not going to care?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed bitterly, swaying slightly. “Care? That’s rich coming from you. Thought you were too busy judging me to actually give a damn.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s jaw tightened, her anger bubbling to the surface. “You’re impossible, you know that?”</p><p dir="ltr">“And you’re predictable,” Rio shot back, her voice laced with bitterness. “Always so perfect, so in control. Must be exhausting, huh?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. “Sit down before you fall over,” she said, her voice softer now.</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t tell me what to do,” Rio muttered, but she allowed Agatha to guide her to the couch. She flopped down, leaning her head against the backrest, her eyes half-closed.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha stood over her, arms crossed again. “What were you thinking, drinking like this?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I was thinking,” Rio said, her voice quiet but cutting, “that maybe I should live up to everyone’s expectations. Be the reckless mess you seem to think I am.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Rio,” Agatha said, her voice faltering. She hated seeing her like this—defensive, hurt, and so clearly trying to mask whatever was really going on.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha sat down beside Rio, keeping a careful distance as her hands clasped tightly in her lap. Her stomach twisted in knots. Apologizing wasn’t something she did often, and certainly not something she was good at.</p><p dir="ltr">“I didn’t mean what I said earlier,” Agatha started, her voice quieter than usual. “About you being reckless or selfish. I was angry, and I lashed out.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio turned her head slightly, her glassy eyes meeting Agatha’s. “Why were you angry?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha hesitated, her heart pounding. She could feel the weight of the question, but more than that, she could feel Rio’s gaze on her, piercing through her defenses. “Because...you get under my skin,” she admitted finally, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio let out a bitter laugh, leaning her head back against the couch. “That’s not an apology, Harkness.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I know,” Agatha said quickly, shaking her head. “I’m sorry. For all of it. You didn’t deserve the things I said.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio shifted, turning to face her more fully. Her expression was wary, her guard still up. “Do you really mean it?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I do,” Agatha said firmly. “I mean it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio sat up straighter, the alcohol in her system doing little to dull her sharp instincts. “Then prove it,” she said, her tone softer but no less challenging.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha frowned, confused. “How?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio leaned closer, her smirk faint but teasing. “Let loose. Tell me something about yourself that no one else knows.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha blinked, taken aback. “What?”</p><p dir="ltr">“You heard me,” Rio said, her tone insistent. “You want me to believe you’re sorry? Drop the perfect act for five minutes. Show me the real you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha froze, her fingers twisting nervously in her lap. Her first instinct was to push back, to deflect. But Rio’s gaze was steady, her challenge clear. Agatha’s chest tightened as she felt the familiar pull of vulnerability—a pull she hated, but one she couldn’t ignore.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, she exhaled shakily. “Fine.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees. She didn’t look at Rio as she spoke, her voice quiet but steady. “When I was a kid, I wasn’t...like this,” she said, gesturing to herself. “Organized. Controlled. I was...chaotic. Loud. Messy. A lot like you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio raised an eyebrow, surprised. “Is that so? Go on.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, a bitter smile tugging at her lips. “My mother hated it. Evanora...she had no patience for anything she couldn’t control. And I was the epitome of everything she couldn’t control.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s expression softened, her teasing smirk fading. “What did she do?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s hands tightened into fists, her nails digging into her palms. “She punished me. Constantly. For the smallest things. If my room wasn’t spotless, if I forgot to put something away, if I spoke out of turn...it didn’t matter. She always found a reason.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s chest tightened, her heart aching at the bitterness in Agatha’s voice. “Wanda mentioned it..”</p><p dir="ltr">“It was normal,” Agatha said, her voice clipped. “At least, it felt normal at the time. I thought if I could just...be better, if I could be perfect, maybe she’d stop.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Did it work?” Rio asked softly.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha let out a hollow laugh. “In a way. She stopped finding reasons to punish me because I stopped giving her any. I learned to keep my room pristine, my schedule perfect, my emotions in check. The more controlled I was, the safer I felt.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio frowned, her gaze searching Agatha’s face. “But you weren’t really safe, were you?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha shook her head. “No. I wasn’t.”</p><p dir="ltr">They sat in silence for a moment, the weight of Agatha’s confession hanging heavy between them. Then Rio reached out, hesitating before gently placing a hand on Agatha’s arm.</p><p dir="ltr">“You didn’t deserve that,” Rio said firmly.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s throat tightened, her gaze fixed on the floor. “It doesn’t matter now.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It does,” Rio said, her voice soft but insistent. “It shaped you. And it’s why you’re so hard on yourself. And on me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha glanced at her, startled by the observation. “I just...I don’t want to lose control. Ever again.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio nodded slowly, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s arm. “I get it. But you don’t have to hold onto that so tightly. It’s okay to let go sometimes.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s lips parted as if to argue, but the words didn’t come. Instead, she let out a shaky breath, the weight on her chest easing slightly.</p><p dir="ltr">“You wanted the real me,” Agatha said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. “There it is. Happy?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio smiled faintly, her hand still resting on Agatha’s arm. “I’m not happy you went through that, but...I’m glad you told me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha frowned. “Why?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Because now I know why you are the way you are,” Rio said simply. “And it makes me want to try harder to understand you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s chest tightened again, but this time it wasn’t unpleasant. She looked at Rio, her usual sharp edges softened, and for the first time in a long time, she felt seen.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re infuriating, you know that?” Agatha said, her lips quirking into a small smile.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio chuckled. “I’ve been told.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio shifted uncomfortably on the couch, her smirk faltering as Agatha’s story settled in the room like a tangible weight. The warmth of Agatha’s vulnerability had chipped away at her defenses, leaving her raw and exposed. She couldn’t let Agatha carry the burden of honesty alone—not after that.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio leaned back, running a hand through her hair. “Alright,” she said softly, her voice barely above a whisper. “I guess it’s my turn.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha tilted her head, her expression curious but cautious. “You don’t have to—”</p><p dir="ltr">“I want to,” Rio interrupted, her tone firm but not harsh. She took a deep breath, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her hoodie.</p><p dir="ltr">“My parents died when I was six,” Rio began, her voice steady but distant. “Car accident. I don’t remember much about them—just fragments. The way my mom laughed, my dad’s cologne, how they’d tuck me in at night and tell me stories. Stupid little things that don’t feel real anymore.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s chest tightened, and she instinctively reached out, her hand brushing against Rio’s. But Rio didn’t seem to notice, her gaze fixed on some invisible point across the room.</p><p dir="ltr">“They didn’t have any family who could take me in, so I ended up in the system,” Rio continued. “And let me tell you, I’m not sure if it’s worse to be born into it or to get thrown into it like I was. At least when you’re born in the system, you don’t know what you’re missing. But me? I knew.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her voice cracked slightly, and she paused, swallowing hard.</p><p dir="ltr">“I knew what it felt like to have parents who loved me,” Rio said, her tone bitter. “And then I knew what it felt like to lose them.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s hand stilled against Rio’s, her heart breaking at the rawness in her voice.</p><p dir="ltr">“I was too old for anyone to want me,” Rio said after a moment, her voice steadier now, though no less vulnerable. “Everyone wants babies, toddlers—kids they can mold into their perfect little families. But a six-year-old with big eyes and a bigger need for affection? That’s a hard sell.”</p><p dir="ltr">She let out a hollow laugh, shaking her head. “So I went into foster homes. One after another. Some were better than others, but let’s be real—‘better’ in the system just means you’re not getting beaten or starved.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha felt her throat tighten. “Rio...”</p><p dir="ltr">“No,” Rio said, cutting her off gently. “Let me finish.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, her fingers curling slightly against Rio’s hand.</p><p dir="ltr">“The thing is, I never stayed anywhere long enough to call it home,” Rio continued. “I was too needy. Too demanding. I wanted love, attention, the kind of affection I remembered from before...but foster parents don’t have time for that. They want kids who can adapt, who don’t ask for too much. And I was...too much.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her voice broke again, and she let out a shaky breath. “I changed homes more often than I changed clothes. And every time I left, it just reinforced this idea that I wasn’t worth keeping.”</p><p dir="ltr">“One of the reasons I’m so...chaotic,” Rio said, gesturing vaguely to herself, “is because no one ever taught me any different. No one taught me how to be organized or neat or...whatever. And honestly? I stopped trying. What was the point when I knew I’d just be uprooted again?”</p><p dir="ltr">Her eyes met Agatha’s then, raw and unguarded. “So yeah, I’m a mess. And I guess I’ve leaned into it because it’s easier than pretending I’ve got my shit together. Easier than hoping for something stable when I know it’ll just fall apart.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha felt a lump rise in her throat, her chest aching with a mix of guilt and compassion. She squeezed Rio’s hand gently, her voice soft when she finally spoke. “You deserved better.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio let out a bitter laugh. “Maybe. But it doesn’t matter now. That’s just...how it was.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It matters,” Agatha said firmly, leaning closer. “It matters because it’s part of who you are. And you’re not a mess, Rio. You’re...resilient. You’ve survived more than most people ever will.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio looked at her, her eyes shining with unshed tears. “Don’t sugarcoat it, Harkness. I’m a disaster.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re not,” Agatha said, her voice unwavering. “You’re human. And you’re worth so much more than you give yourself credit for.”</p><p dir="ltr">For a long moment, they sat in silence, the weight of Rio’s words hanging in the air. Agatha didn’t know how to fix what Rio had been through—she doubted anyone could. But she could be there. And in that moment, it felt like enough.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio broke the silence with a shaky laugh, wiping at her eyes. “Look at us. Two screwed-up roommates baring their souls like it’s some bad therapy session.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled softly. “I’ve had worse therapy sessions.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio snorted, her laughter easing the tension. “Of course you have.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s smile widened, and she hesitated before saying, “Thank you. For telling me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio nodded, her gaze dropping to their joined hands. “Thanks for...listening.”</p><p dir="ltr">As the night wore on, the weight between them didn’t disappear, but it lessened. They stayed on the couch, the TV forgotten, sharing quiet moments that felt like the beginning of something new—a fragile understanding built on honesty and the shared scars they both carried.</p><p dir="ltr">For the first time, neither of them felt the need to fill the silence with words.</p><p dir="ltr">And for the first time, it didn’t feel so heavy.</p>

<p>The library’s heavy glass doors swung closed behind Agatha as she stepped into the cool night air. The streets were quieter than she’d expected, with only the occasional hum of a car passing by. She tightened her coat around her, clutching her bag close as she began her walk home.</p><p>Her mind was busy, swirling with everything that happened the past few days, especially her mother’s phone call, the lingering sting of her words, and the conversation she’d left unfinished with Wanda and Rio. She hated leaving things unresolved, but the weight of everything felt too heavy to face all at once.</p><p>The sound of footsteps behind her pulled her from her thoughts. At first, she dismissed them, assuming it was another late-night student heading back to their dorm. But the steps quickened, matching her pace, then falling out of rhythm.</p><p>Agatha’s grip on her bag tightened, her pulse spiking as she glanced over her shoulder. A man in a dark hoodie was following her, his hands stuffed into his pockets, his face obscured by the streetlights’ shadows.</p><p>“Hey,” the man called, his voice low and rough. “Wait up.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t wait. She started to run.</p><p>“Come on, don’t make this hard,” the man said, his footsteps closing in.</p><p>Agatha quickened her pace, her pulse thrumming in her ears as the footsteps behind her grew louder. She clutched her bag tighter, glancing around for anyone else on the street. It was empty, the nearest streetlamp flickering weakly as if mocking her growing fear.</p><p>Agatha darted into an alley, hoping to find a shortcut or a way to hide, but she quickly realized her mistake. It was a dead end. Her chest heaved as she turned, her back pressed against the cold brick wall.</p><p>The man called out again, his tone sharper now. “Hey, I’m talking to you!”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, her fingers trembling as she pulled her phone from her pocket. She fumbled with the screen, trying to unlock it as her heart pounded. But before she could dial, the man’s voice came again, closer this time.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it,” he snarled.</p><p>She froze, her phone slipping from her grasp and clattering to the pavement. She turned slowly, her back pressing against the cold brick wall of the alley she’d ducked into. The man stood at the entrance, his face partially hidden under the hood of his sweatshirt.</p><p>“Look, I don’t want any trouble,” Agatha said, her voice trembling but firm. “Just take what you want and go.”</p><p>The man stepped closer, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his hoodie. “Smart girl,” he said, his tone mocking. “That bag looks nice. Hand it over.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her grip tightening on the strap of her bag. She knew she should comply, but anger and fear wrestled for control in her chest. The memory of her mother’s voice from that morning—sharp, demeaning—flashed in her mind. The thought of letting someone else make her feel powerless again was unbearable.</p><p>But then, he pulled out a knife.</p><p>The blade caught the dim light, gleaming in a way that made Agatha’s blood run cold.</p><p>“I said,” he growled, his tone menacing now, “hand it over.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath came in shallow gasps, her hands shaking as she slowly extended the bag toward him.</p><p>Before he could grab it, another voice cut through the tension like a blade.</p><p>“Hey! What the hell do you think you’re doing?”</p><p>Both Agatha and the man turned to see Rio standing at the mouth of the alley. Her dark hair was disheveled, her leather jacket slightly askew, and there was a faint flush to her cheeks that hinted at a drink or two. But her eyes were sharp, blazing with fury as they locked onto the man.</p><p>“Get lost,” the man snapped, brandishing the knife. “This ain’t your business.”</p><p>Rio took a step closer, her movements unsteady but purposeful. “Oh, it’s my business,” she said, her tone dripping with disdain. “You think you can just go around scaring women like this? Not on my watch, asshole.”</p><p>“Rio, don’t,” Agatha said, her voice strained. Her heart hammered in her chest as Rio moved closer, standing between her and the man.</p><p>The man sneered, his grip tightening on the knife. “You’re drunk. Go home before you get hurt.”</p><p>Rio smirked, though there was no humor in it. “Drunk or not, I can still kick your ass.”</p><p>The man lunged suddenly, and everything happened in a blur.</p><p>Rio moved quickly, her hand darting out to grab the man’s wrist just as he lunged toward her. She twisted sharply, forcing the knife away from her body, but the man was stronger than he looked. He shoved her back, trying to wrench his arm free, and they stumbled against the alley wall.</p><p>“Let go!” the man snarled, his free hand striking Rio across the face.</p><p>Rio staggered but didn’t release her grip. Instead, she kicked at his knee, sending him off balance. The knife clattered to the ground, skidding a few feet away. For a brief moment, Agatha felt a flicker of relief—but it was short-lived.</p><p>The man recovered faster than Rio expected, grabbing her by the collar of her jacket and slamming her against the wall. Rio gasped as the impact knocked the breath out of her, but her eyes never left the knife lying on the ground.</p><p>“Rio, stop!” Agatha shouted, panic lacing her voice, but Rio ignored her.</p><p>The man twisted his arm free and dove for the knife. Rio, acting on instinct, lunged after him, grabbing his shoulder and trying to pull him back. Her fingers clawed at his hoodie as he gripped the knife and swung around, the blade flashing dangerously in the dim light.</p><p>Time seemed to slow. Agatha watched in horror as the knife sliced through the air, meeting resistance as it sank into Rio’s side.</p><p>Rio’s body stiffened, her hands instinctively flying to the wound as a sharp gasp escaped her lips. The man froze for a moment, his face pale as he realized what he’d done. Then, with a muttered curse, he shoved Rio aside and bolted out of the alley, his footsteps echoing into the night.</p><p>Rio staggered, her legs threatening to give out. She pressed her hand against the wound, blood seeping between her fingers. She let out a shaky laugh, trying to steady herself. “Well...that sucked.”</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha cried, rushing forward to catch her as she collapsed against the wall.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio mumbled, her voice weak but laced with her usual bravado.</p><p>“You’re not fine!” Agatha snapped, her voice trembling. “You’ve been stabbed!”</p><p>Rio let out a faint, humorless laugh, wincing as pain shot through her. “Yeah, I noticed.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened as she fumbled for her phone, her hands slick with blood. She dialed Wanda, her breath coming in shallow gasps as she pressed the phone to her ear.</p><p>“Come on, come on,” she muttered as the line rang.</p><p>“Agatha?” Wanda’s voice came through, groggy but alert.</p><p>“Wanda, I—I need help,” Agatha said, her voice breaking. “Rio’s hurt. She...she got stabbed. I’m taking her to the hospital.”</p><p>“What?!” Wanda’s voice sharpened. “Where are you?”</p><p>“Near campus,” Agatha said quickly. “I’m heading to St. Francis. Can you meet us there?”</p><p>“I’ll be there,” Wanda said firmly. “Just keep her awake.”</p><p>Agatha ended the call and slipped her phone into her pocket, her hands trembling as she focused on Rio.</p><p>“Stay with me,” she said, her voice trembling. “Just keep talking.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved into a faint smirk. “You’re bossy when you’re scared.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes burned with unshed tears. “Shut up and let me help you.”</p><p>Agatha crouched beside Rio, her hands trembling as she pressed her jacket against the stab wound in Rio’s side. Blood seeped through the fabric, warm and sticky, staining her hands. Rio’s breathing was shallow, her eyes fluttering as if she was on the edge of unconsciousness.</p><p>“No, no, no,” Agatha muttered, panic rising in her chest. “Rio, stay with me. Do you hear me? Stay awake.”</p><p>Rio let out a weak laugh, her lips quirking upward despite the pain etched across her face. “You’re like ...really bossy, you know that?”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha snapped, her voice trembling. “You don’t get to make jokes right now.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio mumbled, though her voice was faint and slurred. “Just...need a nap.”</p><p>“No!” Agatha said sharply, her voice cracking. She shook Rio’s shoulder gently, desperate to keep her focused. “You can’t sleep. You have to stay awake until help gets here.”</p><p>Rio groaned, her head lolling to the side. “You’re no fun.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, her tone softening, though fear still laced her words. “Please. Talk to me. Say something—anything.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze flicked to her, unfocused but amused. “Anything.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath, fighting the urge to cry. “You’re such an idiot.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio whispered, her smirk faltering. “But...I’m your idiot.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened, her heart aching at the vulnerability in Rio’s voice. She glanced down the empty street, willing the ambulance to arrive faster.</p><p>“You’re not allowed to die, okay?” Agatha said, her voice trembling as she turned back to Rio. “You don’t get to pull something stupid like this and leave me.”</p><p>Rio blinked up at her, her lips twitching into a faint smile. “Didn’t know...you cared so much.”</p><p>“Of course I care, you idiot,” Agatha said, her voice breaking. “You—” She stopped, the words catching in her throat. “You have to fight, okay?”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened slightly, though it was strained. “You’re kinda...cute when you’re all emotional.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, half in frustration, half in desperation. “God, you’re impossible.”</p><p>“Yep,” Rio murmured, her eyes fluttering again.</p><p>“No, no, no,” Agatha said, shaking her gently. “You don’t get to close your eyes. Stay with me. Talk to me, Rio.”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio said weakly, her voice barely audible. “What...do you wanna talk about?”</p><p>Agatha grasped for anything to keep her awake. “Tell me something. Anything. Why were you even out tonight?”</p><p>“Party,” Rio mumbled, her gaze slipping away from Agatha. “Needed to...blow off steam.”</p><p>“Well, congratulations,” Agatha said, her voice wavering. “You really nailed that part.”</p><p>Rio let out a faint chuckle, though it ended in a pained gasp. Agatha flinched, pressing harder against the wound.</p><p>“Hurts,” Rio muttered, her voice fragile.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said softly, her eyes burning. “But you have to hold on. The ambulance is coming. You just have to hold on a little longer.”</p><p>The distant sound of sirens pierced the night, and Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. Relief mingled with panic as the flashing red and blue lights came into view. She waved frantically as the ambulance pulled to a stop at the mouth of the alley.</p><p>“Over here!” she shouted, her voice hoarse.</p><p>Paramedics rushed toward them, their movements brisk and efficient. Agatha scrambled back, giving them room to work but refusing to let go of Rio’s hand.</p><p>“She’s been stabbed,” Agatha said quickly, her voice trembling. “Her side—she’s lost a lot of blood.”</p><p>One of the paramedics nodded, kneeling beside Rio and assessing the wound. “We’ll take it from here. Are you injured?”</p><p>“No, I’m fine,” Agatha said, her voice breaking. “Just...help her.”</p><p>They worked quickly, stabilizing Rio and lifting her onto a stretcher. As they carried her toward the ambulance, Agatha followed, her heart pounding with every step.</p><p>“Are you riding with her?” one of the paramedics asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said without hesitation, climbing into the back of the ambulance. She sat beside Rio, clutching her hand tightly as the vehicle roared to life and sped toward the hospital.</p><p>“You’re gonna be okay,” Agatha whispered, more to herself than to Rio. “You have to be okay.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched faintly, her voice barely audible as she murmured, “Told you...you care.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, tears threatening to spill as she held onto Rio’s hand like a lifeline. “Shut up and focus on breathing, you idiot.”</p><p>The ambulance sped through the night, its sirens wailing as Agatha clung to hope—and to Rio.</p><p>The hospital waiting room was fluorescent and sterile, the hum of overhead lights doing nothing to ease Agatha’s nerves. She sat rigidly in one of the uncomfortable chairs, her hands still faintly stained with Rio’s blood despite multiple attempts to scrub them clean.</p><p>Wanda arrived within minutes, her red hair a chaotic mess and her face pale with worry. She scanned the room, spotting Agatha immediately, and hurried over.</p><p>“Where is she?” Wanda asked breathlessly, dropping into the chair beside her.</p><p>“They took her into surgery,” Agatha said, her voice thin and trembling. “The knife hit her side...there was so much blood, Wanda.”</p><p>“She’s tough,” Wanda said, squeezing Agatha’s shoulder. “Rio’s not going down that easily.”</p><p>Agatha nodded numbly, but her mind raced with every worst-case scenario. “I should have done something. I just froze. She got hurt because of me.”</p><p>“This isn’t your fault,” Wanda said firmly.</p><p>“She wouldn’t have even been there if it weren’t for me,” Agatha said, her voice breaking. “I don’t know what I’d do if—if she doesn’t—”</p><p>“Stop,” Wanda interrupted, her voice gentle but commanding. “Don’t even think like that. Rio’s going to be fine. You’re both going to be fine.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily, leaning her elbows on her knees and burying her face in her hands. “Why would she even do that? She could’ve just walked away.”</p><p>Wanda smiled faintly. “Because that’s who she is. You should know that by now.”</p><p>Hours crawled by, each minute stretching unbearably long. Agatha paced the waiting room, her mind a mess of guilt, fear, and memories of Rio—her teasing smirks, her careless charm, her fierce protectiveness.</p><p>Wanda sat in the corner, watching her with a mix of sympathy and exasperation. “You’re going to wear a hole in the floor,” she said lightly.</p><p>“I can’t just sit here,” Agatha replied, her voice sharp with tension.</p><p>“You can,” Wanda said. “And you will, because the doctors need to do their job, and you pacing like a maniac isn’t going to help.”</p><p>Agatha stopped, her shoulders slumping. She sank into a chair, resting her head in her hands. “This is my fault.”</p><p>Wanda sighed. “Agatha, I know you’re scared. But Rio’s not the type to let someone she cares about get hurt. You know that, don’t you?”</p><p>Agatha looked up, startled. “What are you talking about?”</p><p>“Come on,” Wanda said, smirking slightly. “You really think she’d throw herself into danger like that for just anyone? You mean something to her, Agatha. Even if she won’t say it out loud.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart twisted at Wanda’s words. She wanted to believe them, but the fear gnawing at her chest was louder.</p><p>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, a doctor approached. His expression was calm but serious, his presence commanding the attention of the waiting room.</p><p>“Are you here for Rio Vidal?” he asked.</p><p>Agatha and Wanda both stood immediately. “Yes,” Agatha said, her voice tight. “How is she?”</p><p>“She’s stable,” the doctor said, offering a reassuring smile. “The knife missed any major organs. She lost a lot of blood, but we were able to stop the bleeding and stitch the wound. She’s going to be fine, but she’ll need to rest and recover for a while.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, the tension in her chest easing slightly. “Can I see her?”</p><p>“She’s still groggy from the anesthesia, but you can visit her briefly,” the doctor said, gesturing toward the hallway.</p><p>Wanda nudged Agatha gently. “Go. I’ll wait here.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then nodded, her legs feeling heavy as she followed the doctor.</p><p>The room was dimly lit, the faint beep of the heart monitor the only sound as Agatha stepped inside. Her heart pounded in her chest as her eyes landed on Rio, who lay pale and still in the hospital bed. Tubes and wires ran from her body to various machines, and though her breathing was steady, she looked far too fragile for someone usually so full of life.</p><p>Agatha hesitated near the doorway, unsure if she should intrude. But as she took a step closer, Rio stirred, her dark eyes fluttering open. They were glassy and unfocused, her pupils sluggish from the effects of anesthesia.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio mumbled, her voice thick and slurred, like someone half-drunk. Her lips quirked into a lazy grin. “You...you’re here.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath, moving to the side of the bed. “Of course I’m here. How are you feeling?”</p><p>“Like...like someone stabbed me,” Rio said, her words dragging as she struggled to stay coherent. “Oh, wait. They did.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, though a faint smile tugged at her lips. “Idiot.”</p><p>“Yup,” Rio murmured, her grin widening. “We’ve already established that.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “You’re also impossible.”</p><p>Rio responded, the sound weak and raspy. “You’re cute when you’re mad, you know that? All...huffy and stuff. Like a little angry librarian.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped, but before she could respond, Rio kept talking, her words tumbling out in a drugged haze.</p><p>“And your hair,” Rio continued, her gaze unfocused but adoring. “It’s all neat and shiny. Makes me wanna...mess it up. Just a little.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, completely thrown off. “Rio, you’re—”</p><p>“And your voice,” Rio interrupted, her tone almost dreamy. “It’s all...smart and snippy. Like you’re judging everyone, but in a hot way.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said firmly, though her voice cracked slightly. She crossed her arms, trying to suppress the warmth rising to her cheeks. “You’re high on anesthesia. You don’t know what you’re saying.”</p><p>“Do too,” Rio slurred, pouting like a child. “I think you’re cute, Harkness. You’re, like...the cutest person I’ve ever met. Even when you’re being mean.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart raced, her hands twitching at her sides. “You’re ridiculous.”</p><p>“Ridiculously into you,” Rio mumbled, her grin softening as her eyelids drooped. “Don’t...don’t tell anyone, though. It’s...a secret.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to respond but stopped herself. Rio’s breathing had evened out, her eyes sliding shut as sleep overtook her again. She looked peaceful, her earlier teasing replaced by a quiet vulnerability that made Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>She sat down in the chair beside the bed, her hand hovering over Rio’s for a moment before finally resting on top of it. “You’re lucky you’re drugged,” she murmured softly. “Or I’d make you regret every word of that.”</p><p>But as she watched Rio sleep, a faint smile tugged at her lips. For all her chaos and recklessness, Rio had a way of breaking through Agatha’s walls in a way no one else ever had.</p><p> For all her walls and sharp words, she couldn’t deny the truth anymore: Rio meant more to her than she’d ever realized.</p><p>And that terrified her.</p><p>And for the first time, Agatha wasn’t sure she wanted to rebuild her walls.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The hospital room was bathed in soft morning light, the faint hum of machines blending with the quiet shuffle of nurses in the hallway. Rio stirred, the lingering haze of sleep clinging to her as she became aware of the world around her. Her side throbbed with a dull ache, a reminder of the knife wound, but it wasn’t unbearable.</p><p>She was about to open her eyes and groggily announce her return to consciousness when she heard Agatha’s voice.</p><p>It was low and steady, tinged with something Rio couldn’t quite place. She decided to keep her eyes closed, feigning sleep, hoping to surprise Agatha with one of her classic sarcastic quips. But as Agatha’s words became clearer, the plan faltered.</p><p>“Wanda, I just don’t know what to do with her sometimes,” Agatha said, her tone exasperated but not angry. She paced the room, her phone pressed to her ear. “She’s so reckless. Running into danger without thinking, acting like nothing can hurt her.”</p><p>Rio frowned, the ache in her chest suddenly heavier than the one in her side. She wasn’t sure why Agatha’s words stung as much as they did, but they did.</p><p>“She’s always been like this,” Agatha continued, her voice lowering slightly. “Chaotic, unpredictable...irresponsible.”</p><p>Rio’s heart sank. The words felt like tiny daggers, each one piercing deeper than the last. She wanted to tell herself it was the truth—that she was reckless and chaotic, always stumbling her way through life. But hearing it from Agatha, from the person she’d hoped saw something more in her, was unbearable.</p><p>She clenched her jaw, tears pricking at the corners of her eyes. She wanted to sit up, to confront Agatha, to demand why she was even here if she felt that way. But the weight of her own insecurities held her back.</p><p>“Maybe she’s right,” Rio thought bitterly. “Maybe I’m just a mess.”</p><p>Agatha kept talking, her voice too soft for Rio to catch every word. The muffled tones only added to the sting, feeding the growing pit in Rio’s stomach.</p><p>Desperate to block it out, Rio turned onto her side, wincing as the motion pulled at her stitches. She grabbed the pillow and pressed it over her ears, shutting out the sound of Agatha’s voice. She didn’t want to hear any more—didn’t want to know how much worse it could get.</p><p>Agatha paused by the window, glancing at the still figure in the bed. She smiled softly, her gaze lingering on Rio’s face.</p><p>“And yet,” Agatha continued, her voice quieter now, “she somehow gets under my skin in the best way.”</p><p>Wanda’s voice on the other end of the line was teasing. “Under your skin, huh? Sounds serious.”</p><p>Agatha let out a small laugh, her cheeks warming despite herself. “Last night, when she was all groggy from the anesthesia, she pretty much told me she liked me.”</p><p>“Pretty much?” Wanda asked, her tone amused.</p><p>“Okay, she definitely told me,” Agatha admitted, her voice tinged with nervous excitement. “She was going on about how cute she thinks I am. It was...ridiculous.”</p><p>“And you’re excited,” Wanda said knowingly.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said, her voice softening. “I’ve been wanting to tell her how I feel for so long, but I was scared. Now I finally can.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression shifted, her smile faltering slightly. “I just don’t want her to think I’m only saying it because of what happened. I don’t want her to doubt that I mean it.”</p><p>“Then tell her,” Wanda said simply. “When she wakes up, tell her. She deserves to hear it.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, though Wanda couldn’t see her. “I will.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio lay on her side, her back to Agatha. The pillow muffled the world around her, but it didn’t stop the tears that slipped silently down her cheeks. She hated how much she cared, hated the vulnerability that came with it.</p><p>For a brief, fleeting moment, she’d let herself believe that maybe—just maybe—Agatha felt the same way. But now, the weight of Agatha’s earlier words crushed that hope beneath their sharp edges.</p><p>“Why would she like me?” Rio thought bitterly. “I’m just a reckless, chaotic mess. She deserves better.”</p><p>Rio wiped at her face quickly, determined not to let Agatha see her cry. If she didn’t mean anything to Agatha, she wasn’t going to let her see how much it hurt.</p><p>Agatha ended her call with Wanda, slipping her phone into her pocket as she turned back toward the bed. She frowned, noticing that Rio had shifted onto her side, her back to the room. Something about her posture seemed tense, almost...defensive.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha said softly, stepping closer. “Are you awake?”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond, keeping her breathing slow and steady to feign sleep. Agatha hesitated, her brow furrowing.</p><p>“You’re probably just tired,” Agatha murmured, sitting in the chair beside the bed. “But I...I wanted to say thank you. For last night. For everything.”</p><p>She paused, her gaze lingering on Rio’s still form. “And when you’re ready, I...I have something I need to tell you.”</p><p>Rio’s heart ached at the warmth in Agatha’s voice, but she didn’t move. She couldn’t bring herself to turn around—not when she felt so raw, so sure that she’d only imagined any affection from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha sighed, leaning back in the chair. “Rest up, idiot,” she said softly. “You’ll need your energy to argue with me when you wake up.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip, tears slipping silently down her face as she pretended to sleep, wishing she could believe that Agatha’s words were meant for her—and not just out of gratitude.</p><p>Agatha walked into the apartment, her mind a mix of nerves and anticipation. She had barely slept the night before, her thoughts entirely consumed by Rio. The groggy confession, the moments at her bedside—everything felt like it was leading to something important, something Agatha had been too scared to face until now.</p><p>She headed to her room, peeling off her rumpled clothes and stepping into the shower. The hot water washed away the stress of the past night, but her mind stayed fixated on Rio. She replayed every moment, every look, every word. Her lips curved into a soft smile as she thought about what she would say when she saw Rio again.</p><p>After her shower, she changed into a fresh outfit, grabbed her bag, and stopped by a local shop to pick up a few of Rio’s favorite snacks—things Rio had offhandedly mentioned in the past that Agatha had pretended not to care about but remembered anyway.</p><p>By the time she arrived back at the hospital, she was practically buzzing with anticipation. She couldn’t wait to see Rio awake, to tease her about her anesthesia-induced confession, to finally—finally—tell her how she felt.</p><p>Agatha approached the nurse’s station, the bag of snacks in her hand. “Hi, I’m here to see Rio Vidal.”</p><p>The nurse glanced up, typing something into her computer. Her friendly expression faltered slightly. “I’m sorry, but Ms. Vidal has requested no visitors.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, confused. “What? That can’t be right. I was here last night.”</p><p>The nurse gave her a sympathetic look. “I understand, but the patient specifically requested not to see anyone.”</p><p>“There must be a mistake,” Agatha said, her voice tightening. “Can you check again?”</p><p>“I’m afraid there’s no mistake,” the nurse said gently. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. She clutched the bag of snacks, her mind racing. “Can you at least give these to her?” she asked, her voice quieter now.</p><p>The nurse nodded, taking the bag. “Of course. I’ll make sure she gets them.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her feet rooted to the spot as her mind struggled to make sense of what was happening. Finally, she nodded, murmuring a quiet “Thank you” before turning and walking out of the hospital.</p><p>Agatha sat in her car, her phone in her hand. She stared at Rio’s name on the screen, her thumb hovering over the call button. The idea of Rio not wanting to see her gnawed at her, a painful knot in her chest that refused to loosen.</p><p>Finally, she pressed the button, holding her breath as the line rang.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>She tried again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>The fourth time, Rio finally picked up. Her voice was quiet, tired, and distant. “What do you want, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha froze, the coldness in Rio’s tone cutting deeper than she’d expected. “What do I want? I want to know what’s going on. Why won’t you see me?”</p><p>There was a pause, and when Rio spoke again, her voice was heavy with emotion. “Just...go home, Agatha. Please.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said firmly. “Not until you tell me what’s going on. Did I do something wrong?”</p><p>Another silence. Then, Rio’s voice broke slightly. “I heard you, okay? Talking to Wanda.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart sank. “You...you heard me?”</p><p>Rio let out a shaky breath. “I heard you say I’m irresponsible and chaotic and...whatever else. And you’re right. I am. But I don’t need to hear it from you. I don’t need to be reminded that I’m just...a bother.”</p><p>“A bother?” Agatha’s voice rose, panic creeping into her tone. “Rio, that’s not—”</p><p>“Please, Agatha,” Rio interrupted, her voice quiet but firm. “Just go home. Forget about me.”</p><p>“Rio, listen to me—” Agatha started, but Rio cut her off again.</p><p>“Goodbye, Agatha,” Rio said softly before the line went dead.</p><p>Agatha stared at her phone, her heart pounding. The words echoed in her head, each one laced with pain and finality. She had no idea how everything had unraveled so quickly, but she knew one thing for certain: she wasn’t about to give up.</p><p>Agatha sat in her car, her phone clutched tightly in her hand. The pain of Rio’s words echoed in her mind, and for the first time in a long while, she felt completely lost. She needed help—someone who could make sense of this mess, someone she trusted.</p><p>She scrolled through her contacts, landing on Wanda’s name. With a deep breath, she pressed the call button.</p><p>Wanda answered on the second ring. “Hey, Agatha. How’s Rio?”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. “Not good. Can we meet? I...I need to talk.”</p><p>Wanda’s tone softened immediately. “Of course. Coffee shop near campus?”</p><p>“Yeah. Thanks, Wanda.” Agatha’s voice cracked slightly, and she hung up before she could lose her composure.</p><p>The coffee shop was buzzing with life, the soft hum of conversation blending with the clinking of cups. Agatha spotted Wanda in a corner booth, her scarlet hair unmistakable. Wanda waved her over, her face already lined with concern.</p><p>Agatha slid into the seat across from her, wrapping her hands around the coffee Wanda had ordered for her. For a moment, she just stared at the steam rising from the cup, trying to gather her thoughts.</p><p>“Okay,” Wanda said gently. “Tell me what’s going on.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath, her words tumbling out in a rush. “Rio doesn’t want to see me. She told the hospital to turn me away, and when I called her, she said she heard me talking to you. She thinks I...I called her a bother.”</p><p>Wanda’s brow furrowed. “What? Agatha, that’s not what you said.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said, her voice tinged with frustration. “But she didn’t hear the rest of the conversation. She just...she heard me venting about how reckless and chaotic she is. And now she thinks I don’t care about her. She thinks I don’t...”</p><p>Agatha trailed off, her throat tightening. She took a shaky sip of coffee, avoiding Wanda’s piercing gaze.</p><p>“Don’t what?” Wanda prompted softly.</p><p>Agatha sighed, setting the cup down. “She thinks I don’t like her. That I don’t...feel the way she does.”</p><p>Wanda leaned back, crossing her arms. “And do you?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said without hesitation. “But now I’ve completely screwed it up.”</p><p>Wanda smiled faintly. “Well, at least you’re admitting it now. That’s progress.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, running a hand through her hair. “Wanda, this isn’t funny. She won’t even let me talk to her. How am I supposed to fix this?”</p><p>Wanda tapped her fingers on the table thoughtfully. “First of all, you need to stop blaming yourself for things that aren’t entirely your fault. Rio jumped to conclusions because she’s scared. Scared you don’t care about her, scared she’s not good enough for you, scared to get hurt.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Why would she think she’s not good enough for me?”</p><p>“Because she’s spent her entire life being told she’s not good enough for anyone,” Wanda said simply. “Rio’s never had stability, Agatha. She’s used to people leaving, so she pushes them away before they can hurt her. That’s what she’s doing now.”</p><p>Agatha slumped in her seat, guilt gnawing at her. “So what do I do?”</p><p>“You show her that you’re not going anywhere,” Wanda said. “And that’s not going to be easy. You’ll have to fight for her, even when she’s pushing you away.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, her resolve hardening. “How?”</p><p>“Start with the truth,” Wanda said. “Tell her exactly how you feel. No deflections, no overthinking. Just...be honest.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, the thought of opening up fully both terrifying and freeing. “What if she doesn’t believe me?”</p><p>“Then you keep trying,” Wanda said firmly. “You don’t let her go without a fight.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled deeply, her mind racing. “You make it sound so simple.”</p><p>“It’s not simple,” Wanda said with a small smile. “But it’s worth it, isn’t it?”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her coffee, the knot in her chest loosening slightly. “Yeah. It is.”</p><p>Wanda leaned forward, her tone turning conspiratorial. “Okay, here’s what you’re going to do. First, you’re going to give her some space. Let her process whatever she’s feeling.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “But—”</p><p>“No buts,” Wanda said firmly. “She’s hurt right now, and you need to respect that. Let her know you’re here, but don’t push too hard.”</p><p>Agatha nodded reluctantly. “Fine. And then?”</p><p>“Then, you go to her in person. And you tell her everything,” Wanda said, her eyes bright with determination. “No holding back, no letting her run away. You make her see that she’s not a bother, that she’s important to you, that you’re not going to leave.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched into a small smile. “You really think this will work?”</p><p>“I think Rio needs someone who will fight for her,” Wanda said. “And I think you’re exactly the person who can do it.”</p><p>As Agatha left the coffee shop, a plan forming in her mind, she felt a glimmer of hope for the first time since everything had fallen apart. It wasn’t going to be easy, but Wanda was right—Rio was worth it.</p><p>And this time, Agatha wasn’t going to let her go.</p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha paced the length of the living room, her nerves twisting in knots. It had been a few days since her conversation with Wanda, and though she had given Rio space as advised, the silence had been unbearable.</p><p>Now, she knew Rio was coming home. Wanda had texted her earlier to let her know Rio was being discharged, and Agatha had spent the afternoon rehearsing everything she wanted to say. But as the minutes ticked by, doubt crept in. What if Rio didn’t want to hear her? What if Rio still thought she was a burden?</p><p>The sound of a key turning in the lock snapped her out of her thoughts. Agatha froze, her heart hammering as the door opened and Rio stepped inside, looking pale but determined.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, her voice quiet as she set her bag down. She didn’t look at Agatha, her movements stiff and deliberate.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha replied, her voice steadier than she felt.</p><p>Rio didn’t stop to chat. She headed straight for her room, her body language screaming exhaustion—not just physical, but emotional.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then followed. “Rio, wait.”</p><p>Rio stopped in the hallway but didn’t turn around. “What is it, Agatha?” she asked, her tone flat.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her rehearsed words suddenly jumbled in her head. “I...I need to talk to you.”</p><p>Rio sighed, leaning against the wall. “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p><p>“Well, I do,” Agatha said, her voice firming. She stepped closer, her hands clenched at her sides. “You’ve been avoiding me since the hospital, and I need to know why.”</p><p>Rio finally turned, her eyes tired and guarded. “Why? Because I heard you, Agatha. I heard you tell Wanda how irresponsible and chaotic I am, how I’m just a—”</p><p>“Stop,” Agatha interrupted, her voice trembling. “You didn’t hear everything.”</p><p>Rio blinked, taken aback. “What?”</p><p>“You didn’t hear everything,” Agatha repeated, stepping closer. “Yes, I vented to Wanda. Yes, I said you’re reckless and chaotic because sometimes you are. But I also said that you mean more to me than anyone else in the world.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, her expression flickering with uncertainty. “You did?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said, her voice softening. “And you didn’t hear me say how much you scared me when you got hurt, or how much it terrified me to think of losing you, or how...how much I care about you.”</p><p>Rio stared at her, her eyes wide and searching. “You don’t mean that.”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha said, her voice breaking slightly. “I’ve been so afraid to say it, Rio. Afraid that you’d think I didn’t mean it, or that you’d push me away. But I’m done being afraid. I like you. More than I’ve liked anyone in my entire life.”</p><p>Rio’s lip trembled, but she quickly looked away, shaking her head. “You don’t want someone like me, Agatha. I’m a mess. I’m—”</p><p>“I don’t care,” Agatha interrupted. She reached out, gently taking Rio’s hand. “I don’t care if you’re a mess, or if you’re chaotic, or if you drive me insane half the time. I care about you. All of you. And I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Rio’s defenses crumbled all at once. Tears welled in her eyes as she looked at Agatha, her voice trembling. “You really mean that?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her own eyes shining. “Yes. And if you’d let me, I’d say it a hundred more times until you believed me.”</p><p>Rio let out a shaky laugh, wiping at her eyes. “You’re impossible, Harkness.”</p><p>“Says the queen of chaos,” Agatha teased gently, a small smile breaking through her nervousness.</p><p>Rio hesitated, then finally squeezed Agatha’s hand. “I was so scared you didn’t...that I’d just made it all up in my head.”</p><p>“You didn’t,” Agatha said firmly. “I’m sorry I made you feel that way. But I’m here now. And I’m not letting you go.”</p><p>For a moment, they stood in silence, the weight of their emotions settling between them. Then, Rio smiled faintly, her voice teasing but soft. “You know, for someone so uptight, you’re pretty good at grand gestures.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, the sound breaking the last of the tension. “Don’t get used to it.”</p><p>They moved to the couch, sitting close but not touching, both of them still raw but lighter now. Agatha handed Rio a bag she’d left on the coffee table, filled with snacks.</p><p>Rio peeked inside, her eyes widening. “These are my favorites.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said, her tone casual but warm.</p><p>Rio smiled, her walls finally down. “Thanks, Harkness. For everything.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, her heart swelling. “Anytime.”</p><p>As they sat there, sharing snacks and quiet conversation, it wasn’t perfect—but it was a start. And for the first time, neither of them felt like they had to face the chaos alone.</p><p>The apartment was quiet, the air between Agatha and Rio feeling lighter yet still tentative. They sat on the couch, their knees almost touching, a half-empty bag of snacks between them. Rio leaned back, twirling a wrapper between her fingers, while Agatha sat upright, her hands resting awkwardly in her lap.</p><p>“So,” Rio started, breaking the silence, her voice teasing but nervous. “We’ve, uh, established that you like me. Which, I gotta say, is a pretty big deal.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but a faint blush crept up her neck. “Yes, well, miracles happen.”</p><p>Rio grinned, her confidence slowly returning. “Okay, so...what happens now? Are we, like, a thing? Do we start planning our wedding? Should I pick out a dress?”</p><p>Agatha let out a snort, shaking her head. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>“And yet, you like me anyway,” Rio quipped, her smirk softening as she glanced at Agatha. “But seriously, what do you want to do? I mean...I don’t exactly have a great track record with this kind of thing.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her hands fiddling with the hem of her sweater. “Honestly? I don’t know. I’ve never...done this before. Not like this.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, meeting Rio’s gaze. “I’ve never cared about someone like this before. It’s...new. And terrifying.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, her voice softening. “Yeah. It is.”</p><p>For a moment, they sat in silence, the weight of their emotions settling between them. Then Rio reached over, brushing her fingers lightly against Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“How about this,” Rio said, her tone gentle. “We take it one step at a time. No pressure, no overthinking. Just...see where it goes.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at their hands, her lips curving into a small smile. “I think I can handle that.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio said, leaning back with a dramatic sigh of relief. “Because I was really hoping to take you out on a proper date. Y’know, something that doesn’t involve me getting stabbed.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, the sound light and genuine. “I suppose I could let you take me somewhere. Just don’t expect me to let you pick the restaurant.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Deal.”</p><p>The sound of Agatha’s phone buzzing on the coffee table interrupted their moment. She picked it up, glancing at the screen. “It’s Wanda.”</p><p>“Of course it is,” Rio said, smirking. “Bet she’s dying to know what happened.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but answered the call. “Yes, Wanda?”</p><p>“Don’t ‘yes, Wanda’ me,” Wanda said, her tone impatient. “I’ve been sitting here waiting for an update for hours. How did it go?”</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio, who was leaning in, clearly trying to eavesdrop. “It went...fine.”</p><p>“Fine?” Wanda repeated, incredulous. “Agatha, this is me. I know you better than that. Give me details.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, a small smile tugging at her lips. “We talked. We...figured things out. Sort of.”</p><p>“Sort of?” Wanda pressed. “You’re killing me here, Harkness. Did you confess? Did she confess? Are you planning the wedding yet?”</p><p>“Apparently that’s Rio’s job,” Agatha muttered, earning a laugh from Rio.</p><p>Wanda gasped theatrically. “Oh my god, you’re in the same room right now, aren’t you? Hi, Rio!”</p><p>“Hey, Wanda,” Rio called, grinning. “Thanks for all the help, by the way.”</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Wanda said smugly. “Now, Agatha, spill. What’s the plan? Are you two finally going to go on a date?”</p><p>Agatha groaned, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Yes, Wanda, we’re going on a date. Satisfied?”</p><p>“Very,” Wanda said, her grin practically audible. “You’re welcome, by the way. Again.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Goodbye, Wanda.”</p><p>“Bye, lovebirds!” Wanda sang before the line went dead.</p><p>Agatha set her phone down, shaking her head. “She’s insufferable.”</p><p>“She’s also not wrong,” Rio said, her smile softening. “This is...kind of a big deal.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her expression growing serious. “It is. But I think we can handle it. One step at a time.”</p><p>“Agreed,” Rio said, holding out her hand. “Partners in chaos?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, taking Rio’s hand. “Partners in chaos.”</p><p>As they sat there, the weight of the past few weeks lifted slightly, replaced by the tentative beginnings of something new—something that felt terrifying and exciting all at once.</p><p>And for the first time in a long time, Agatha felt like maybe, just maybe, she didn’t have to face it alone.</p><p>The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm golden glow through the apartment windows. Agatha and Rio sat on the couch, their usual teasing banter softened by the intimacy of the moment. Agatha’s gaze flicked to Rio’s side, where a bandage peeked out from under her shirt.</p><p>“How’s the wound?” Agatha asked, her voice laced with genuine concern.</p><p>Rio shifted, wincing slightly as she adjusted her position. “It’s...fine. A little sore, but nothing I can’t handle.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, leaning forward. “Have you been keeping it clean? Changing the bandages?”</p><p>“Yes, Mom,” Rio said, smirking.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m serious, Rio. You can’t just ignore it. If it gets infected, you’ll end up back in the hospital.”</p><p>Rio’s smirk faltered, and she nodded, her voice quieter. “I’ve been trying, but...it’s a little hard to reach, y’know?”</p><p>Agatha’s expression softened, her concern outweighing her usual sharpness. “If you need help, you just have to ask.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her shirt. “Actually...there is something.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, waiting patiently. Rio’s cheeks turned a faint shade of pink, and she avoided eye contact, her usual bravado noticeably absent.</p><p>“It’s just...I’ve been avoiding showering,” Rio admitted, her voice barely above a mumble.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Avoiding showering? Rio, that’s not—”</p><p>“I know, I know!” Rio interrupted quickly, holding up her hands. “It’s not great, okay? But it’s hard to reach the bandages, and I didn’t want to risk messing them up.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment, her lips twitching as she fought back a smile. “Are you saying you need help?”</p><p>Rio groaned, burying her face in her hands. “God, don’t make this weird, Harkness. I’m just saying I might need...I don’t know...an extra set of hands to make sure I don’t mess it up.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back, crossing her arms as a smirk spread across her face. “So you want me to help you shower?”</p><p>Rio peeked through her fingers, her face a deeper shade of pink now. “Do you have to say it like that?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said, her tone light but teasing. “Because this is too good to pass up.”</p><p>Rio groaned again, letting her hands fall into her lap. “This is humiliating.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk softened, her teasing giving way to genuine care. “It’s not humiliating, Rio. You got hurt saving me. The least I can do is help you.”</p><p>Rio glanced at her, her usual confidence wavering. “You really don’t mind?”</p><p>Agatha’s expression turned serious. “Of course not. I want to help. You just have to let me.”</p><p>Rio hesitated for a moment before nodding. “Okay. But no weird comments.”</p><p>“No promises,” Agatha said with a grin, standing and holding out her hand.</p><p>Rio groaned as she stood, her hand brushing against Agatha’s briefly. “You’re enjoying this way too much.”</p><p>“Maybe a little,” Agatha admitted, her smirk returning. “But only because you’re terrible at asking for help, and it’s nice to see you being human for once.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, a faint smile tugging at her lips despite her embarrassment. “You’re lucky I like you.”</p><p>“Very,” Agatha said softly, her smirk fading into something more tender.</p><p>They walked toward the bathroom, the teasing banter between them laced with an unspoken warmth. For all the chaos that had brought them together, moments like this reminded them both that vulnerability wasn’t so scary when shared.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The early morning light filtered through the apartment’s curtains, casting a soft glow on the walls. Agatha stood in the kitchen, her movements precise as she prepared tea and set out a plate of toast. The faint sound of a news report played in the background, but her focus was entirely on the task at hand.</p><p>She glanced toward the couch, where Rio lay half-reclined under a pile of blankets. Her dark hair was tousled, her expression soft with the haze of sleep. She shifted slightly, wincing as the motion pulled at her side.</p><p>Agatha frowned, picking up the tray and carrying it over to the couch. “You’re supposed to call me if you need to move,” she said, her tone sharp but undercut with concern.</p><p>Rio opened one eye, a lazy grin spreading across her face. “Good morning to you too, Nurse Harkness.”</p><p>“Don’t start,” Agatha muttered, setting the tray down on the coffee table. She carefully adjusted the pillows behind Rio, her hands gentle but efficient. “How’s the pain?”</p><p>“Manageable,” Rio said, though her wince betrayed her words.</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Agatha replied, crossing her arms. “And on a scale of one to ten, where does ‘manageable’ fall?”</p><p>Rio sighed dramatically. “Maybe a six? Seven if you’re going to keep nagging.”</p><p>“Seven means you need your pain meds,” Agatha said, already moving to grab the prescription bottle. “Why didn’t you say something?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, her grin softening into something more sincere. “Didn’t want to bother you.”</p><p>Agatha froze, her hand hovering over the bottle. “You’re not a bother, Rio. Not to me.”</p><p>The room fell quiet for a moment, the weight of Agatha’s words settling between them. Rio looked away, her fingers fidgeting with the edge of the blanket. “Still feels weird, letting someone take care of me.”</p><p>“Well, get used to it,” Agatha said briskly, sitting back down beside her. “Because you’re not getting rid of me anytime soon.”</p><p>After Rio had eaten and taken her medication, Agatha insisted on helping her clean up. “You’re not staying in those clothes all day,” she said, motioning to Rio’s rumpled shirt.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “What, you want to dress me now too?”</p><p>“If that’s what it takes,” Agatha shot back, though her cheeks reddened slightly.</p><p>Rio smirked but let Agatha help her to her feet. The movement was slow and careful, Agatha’s hand steady on Rio’s arm as they shuffled toward the bathroom.</p><p>“Okay, don’t laugh,” Rio said, her voice softer now. “But I might need help with the bandages again.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression softened. “I figured. Sit on the edge of the tub, and I’ll take a look.”</p><p>Rio complied, her usual bravado dimmed as Agatha carefully peeled back the bandages to inspect the stitches. Her hands were steady, her touch gentle, but her jaw tightened as she saw the angry red wound.</p><p>“It’s healing, but you need to be more careful,” Agatha said quietly. “You can’t keep pushing yourself or your stitches might come off.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said, her voice small. “I just...I hate feeling useless.”</p><p>“You’re not useless,” Agatha replied, her tone firm. “You’re recovering. That’s not the same thing.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched into a faint smile. “You’re pretty good at this whole pep talk thing.”</p><p>“Don’t get used to it,” Agatha said, though her voice held a trace of warmth.</p><p>Later that afternoon, Agatha set Rio up on the couch again with a stack of pillows and her favorite blanket. She handed Rio the remote, along with a bottle of water. “Pick something to watch. I’ll be working over here if you need me.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her. “Wait, you’re just...letting me choose? No snide remarks about my taste in TV?”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “You’ve been stabbed, Rio. Consider this your one free pass.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Oh, I’m definitely milking this.”</p><p>As the hours passed, they fell into an easy rhythm. Agatha worked at the dining table, occasionally glancing over to check on Rio. Meanwhile, Rio flipped through channels, offering sarcastic commentary that earned a few reluctant chuckles from Agatha.</p><p>“Hey, Harkness,” Rio said after a while, her voice soft. “Thanks.”</p><p>Agatha looked up, her expression curious. “For what?”</p><p>“For...all of this,” Rio said, gesturing vaguely to the tray, the blankets, the setup. “I’m not used to people taking care of me.”</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly. “Well, you’d better get used to it. Because, like I said, I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened. “I think I could get used to that.”</p><p>That evening, as the apartment grew quieter, Agatha sat down beside Rio on the couch. She handed her a mug of tea, their fingers brushing briefly.</p><p>“You’re really good at this, you know,” Rio said, her voice low.</p><p>“At what?” Agatha asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“Taking care of people,” Rio said. “Even when you pretend to be all grumpy and detached, you’re actually...kind of amazing.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed, and she looked away. “Don’t get sappy on me, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, her laughter light and genuine. “Too late.”</p><p>As they sat together, the warmth of the tea and the quiet companionship between them, it felt like the chaos of the past few weeks had finally begun to settle. For the first time, both of them felt safe—not just in their surroundings, but in each other.</p><p> </p><p>The apartment felt unusually calm, the usual chaos between Agatha and Rio replaced by a quiet anticipation. Rio sat on the couch, her legs stretched out and her side still tender but healing. Agatha perched on the armchair across from her, a notebook balanced on her lap.</p><p>“So,” Rio began, smirking slightly, “you’ve been acting all mysterious and organized. Are we finally going to talk about this date?”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her pen poised over the notebook. “What do you mean ‘finally’? We’re discussing it right now, aren’t we?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, her grin widening. “You’ve been dodging the topic for two days, Harkness. You were probably planning it in secret so you could control every single detail.”</p><p>“I wasn’t planning in secret,” Agatha replied, her cheeks flushing faintly. “I was...considering the logistics.”</p><p>Rio laughed, wincing slightly as she placed a hand over her side. “God, you’re adorable. Only you would make dating sound like a court case.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes but didn’t argue. “Fine. Let’s talk about the date. What kind of place do you prefer?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, her expression thoughtful. “Honestly? I’m not a fancy restaurant kind of girl. I’m more into places where you can relax, maybe grab a drink, listen to some good music.”</p><p>Agatha scribbled something in her notebook. “Casual. Got it.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward slightly, her smirk turning playful. “What about you? What’s your dream first date, Counselor Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, tapping her pen against the notebook. “Something quiet. Intimate. I don’t like crowds, and I hate anything overly flashy.”</p><p>“Quiet and intimate,” Rio repeated, grinning. “So, no karaoke bars, huh?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a glare. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>“Noted,” Rio said, laughing softly.</p><p>Agatha flipped to a fresh page in her notebook, her voice steady. “Okay. How about this: there’s a café downtown I’ve been to a few times. It’s small, cozy, and they have live acoustic music on weekends. We could go there.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes lit up. “That sounds perfect. What’s the food situation like?”</p><p>“They serve small plates—cheese boards, flatbreads, that sort of thing,” Agatha said.</p><p>“Sold,” Rio said, leaning back with a contented smile. “Look at us, being all responsible and communicative. It’s almost like we’re adults.”</p><p>As the conversation slowed, a subtle tension filled the air. Agatha closed her notebook, setting it aside, while Rio glanced at her hands, fidgeting slightly.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said softly, breaking the silence. “You nervous about this?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, startled. “Why would I be nervous?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, her smile turning a bit shy. “I don’t know. First dates are a big deal, right? Especially when you actually care about the person.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened at Rio’s words. She leaned forward, her voice softer now. “It’s not the date I’m nervous about. It’s...this. Us.”</p><p>Rio looked up, her gaze meeting Agatha’s. “Yeah. Me too.”</p><p>For a moment, the vulnerability between them was palpable. Then Rio grinned, her usual playfulness creeping back in. “But hey, if we survive knife wounds and awkward declarations of feelings, we can survive one little date, right?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, the sound light and genuine. “I suppose you have a point.”</p><p>Rio reached out, her hand brushing against Agatha’s. “Let’s make a deal. No matter what happens, we’re just...ourselves. No trying to be perfect, no overthinking. Deal?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then nodded, her lips curving into a small smile. “Deal.”</p><p>They shook hands, the gesture half-serious but full of warmth.</p><p>“And for the record,” Rio added, her grin widening, “you’re pretty perfect already. Overthinking and all.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed, but she didn’t look away. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>“And yet, you’re planning a date with me,” Rio teased. “Guess you’re stuck with me now.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her smile didn’t fade. “Lucky me.”</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The apartment was unusually chaotic as Rio rifled through her closet, tossing clothes onto her bed in a frenzy. Jeans, leather jackets, a few casual button-ups—none of it felt right. She groaned, running a hand through her hair, and turned to face her classmate, Alice Wu-Gulliver, who sat cross-legged on her desk chair, scrolling through her phone.</p><p>“Okay, Alice, I’m officially freaking out,” Rio said, throwing her hands up. “What am I supposed to wear? This isn’t my thing!”</p><p>Alice glanced up, her expression calm but amused. “Relax, Rio. It’s a date, not a red carpet event. You’re overthinking this.”</p><p>Rio flopped onto the bed, groaning into her pillow. “But it’s Agatha. She’s not just anyone. I can’t just wear my usual...leather jacket and hope for the best.”</p><p>Alice smirked, setting her phone down. “Well, first of all, the leather jacket’s non-negotiable. It’s part of your brand. But let’s dress it up a bit. Maybe a nice shirt, dark jeans, and boots?”</p><p>Rio lifted her head, her expression skeptical. “You think that’ll work?”</p><p>“Trust me,” Alice said, standing up and pulling a crisp black shirt from the pile. “This, paired with the jacket, is the sweet spot. It’s cool, but it says you care.”</p><p>Rio sat up, taking the shirt and holding it against herself. “Huh. Not bad.”</p><p>Alice grinned. “Told you. Now, try it on, and let’s make sure you don’t look like a total disaster. And careful of your stitches, keep the wild acrobatic moves to a minimum” she warned. </p><p>Rio turned and stuck her tongue out teasingly. </p><p>As Rio buttoned up the shirt, she heard the sound of Agatha’s footsteps approaching her room. She turned to find Agatha leaning against the doorway, her arms crossed and a teasing smile playing on her lips.</p><p>“Looks like you’ve got some help,” Agatha remarked, nodding toward Alice.</p><p>“Yeah, Alice saved my life,” Rio said, gesturing dramatically at the clothes. “I was about two seconds away from showing up in my pajamas.”</p><p>Alice snorted, standing up and grabbing her bag. “Well, my work here is done. Good luck, Rio.” She gave Agatha a friendly wave as she left, muttering something about “adorable idiots.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow as she stepped further into the room. “So, you’re taking this seriously, huh?”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio said, smoothing down the shirt. “This is our first official date. Gotta make a good impression.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, her gaze lingering on Rio for a moment longer than necessary. “Well, don’t try too hard. You’re already irresistible.”</p><p>Rio blinked, momentarily thrown off by the compliment, but quickly recovered with a grin. “Irresistible, huh? Does that mean I don’t have to wear pants?”</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Agatha deadpanned, though her eyes twinkled with amusement.</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, watching as Agatha grabbed her coat and keys from the kitchen counter. “Wait, where are you going?”</p><p>“To Wanda’s,” Agatha said matter-of-factly. “I’m getting ready there.”</p><p>Rio frowned, confused. “Why? We live together. Wouldn’t it make more sense to get ready here?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a teasing smile. “It’s bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed, and she rolled her eyes. “This isn’t a wedding, Harkness. It’s dinner.”</p><p>“Semantics,” Agatha said with a shrug. “But if you insist on seeing me now, I could cancel—”</p><p>“Don’t you dare,” Rio interrupted, stepping closer and narrowing her eyes. “Fine. Go to Wanda’s. But if you show up in something ridiculous, I’m blaming her.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, pulling on her coat. “Relax, Rio. I’ll look good enough to make you forget how to talk. See you at dinner.”</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha left, the door clicking shut behind her. She let out a slow breath, her chest tightening with a mix of anticipation and nerves.</p><p>“Well,” she muttered to herself, looking at her reflection in the mirror. “Guess I’d better make sure she’s right about that.”</p><p>Agatha arrived at Wanda’s apartment just as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in soft hues of pink and gold. Wanda opened the door almost immediately, her scarlet hair pulled into a loose bun and her eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p>“You’re late,” Wanda teased, stepping aside to let Agatha in. “I’ve been waiting for this all day.”</p><p>“It’s not like I was standing you up,” Agatha replied, rolling her eyes as she set her bag down.</p><p>“No, that’s Rio’s job,” Wanda said with a smirk. She clapped her hands together, her tone turning mischievous. “So, how can I help? Makeup? Hair? A full fashion overhaul?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, taking a seat on Wanda’s couch. “You’re enjoying this way too much.”</p><p>“Oh, absolutely,” Wanda said, grabbing a makeup bag and sitting beside her. “But only because it’s you. Now spill—how nervous are you?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her fingers fiddling with the hem of her sweater. “I’m not...nervous, exactly. I just don’t want to mess this up.”</p><p>Wanda softened, her teasing fading for a moment. “You won’t. But if it makes you feel better, I’ll make sure you look stunning enough to distract Rio from whatever awkward thing you inevitably say.”</p><p>Agatha scowled, though her cheeks flushed slightly. “You’re insufferable.”</p><p>“And yet, you’re here,” Wanda quipped, pulling out a brush. “Now sit still. I’m going to make you look like the goddess Rio clearly thinks you are.”</p><p>As Wanda worked, Agatha sat quietly, letting her friend apply a subtle touch of makeup and style her hair into soft waves. Wanda chatted the entire time, alternating between teasing remarks and genuine advice.</p><p>“Don’t overthink things,” Wanda said, spritzing Agatha’s hair with a light mist of product. “Rio already likes you. She’s probably stressing out about impressing you just as much as you are about impressing her.”</p><p>“I doubt that,” Agatha muttered, glancing at her reflection. “She’s so...comfortable with this stuff. Dating, being charming—it’s like second nature to her.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Wanda said, stepping back to admire her work. “But that doesn’t mean she’s not nervous. She cares about you, Agatha. She wants this to work just as much as you do.”</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly, her nerves easing slightly. “Thanks, Wanda.”</p><p>“Don’t thank me yet,” Wanda said, rummaging through her closet. She pulled out a sleek, fitted black dress and handed it to Agatha. “Try this on. It’s perfect for you.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “You just happen to have a dress in my size?”</p><p>“I’m always prepared,” Wanda said with a wink. “Now hurry up. I want to see how amazing you look.”</p><p>A few minutes later, Agatha stepped out of the bathroom, the black dress fitting her perfectly. Wanda gasped, clasping her hands together dramatically.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, you are a vision,” Wanda declared, spinning her friend around to inspect the look. “Rio’s going to lose her mind.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress the small smile tugging at her lips. “You think it’s too much?”</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Wanda said firmly. “It’s elegant, understated, and absolutely you. Plus, it gives you that mysterious, ‘I’m way out of your league’ vibe, which I know Rio loves.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, laughing softly. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>“And yet, you keep me around,” Wanda said, grabbing a pair of earrings and handing them to her. “Here. These are the finishing touch.”</p><p>Agatha put the earrings on, glancing at herself in the mirror. For the first time, she felt...ready. Confident. Excited.</p><p>“Thanks, Wanda,” she said softly, turning to her friend.</p><p>“Anytime,” Wanda replied, pulling her into a quick hug. “Now go knock Rio off her feet.”</p><p>As Agatha grabbed her coat and prepared to leave, Wanda called after her, grinning mischievously. “And don’t forget—details. I want every single detail tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, opening the door. “We’ll see.”</p><p>She stepped into the evening air, her heart pounding with a mix of nerves and excitement. Tonight was a big step, but with Wanda’s pep talk and her own growing confidence, she felt ready to face whatever came next—with Rio by her side.</p><p>The downtown café was tucked away on a quiet street, its warm glow spilling out onto the sidewalk. Inside, soft acoustic music filled the air, the sound of a gentle guitar blending seamlessly with the low hum of conversation. Candles flickered on small wooden tables, and the faint aroma of freshly baked bread and rich coffee created a cozy, intimate atmosphere.</p><p>Rio arrived first, her leather jacket slung over her shoulder. She wore a black button-up shirt tucked neatly into dark jeans, the outfit perfectly balancing her usual edge with a hint of refinement. Her boots clicked softly against the hardwood floor as she glanced around, her eyes scanning the room. She felt confident, but a nervous energy buzzed beneath her surface.</p><p>She found a table near the corner, half-hidden but with a clear view of the small stage where a musician was setting up. She draped her jacket over the back of the chair and fidgeted slightly with her cuff as she waited.</p><p>When the door swung open, Rio’s breath hitched. Agatha stepped inside, the soft light catching the subtle waves in her hair. She wore the fitted black dress Wanda had chosen, its clean lines accentuating her sharp features and effortlessly elegant demeanor. A pair of silver earrings glinted at her ears, and her heels gave her an added air of sophistication.</p><p>For a moment, Rio forgot how to breathe.</p><p>Agatha spotted her quickly, her lips curving into a small smile as she walked over. “You’re early,” she said, sliding into the seat across from Rio.</p><p>“You’re...stunning,” Rio blurted out, her cheeks flushing slightly. She coughed, trying to regain her composure. “I mean, uh, you look great.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow, her smirk teasing. “Thanks. You clean up pretty well yourself.”</p><p>Rio grinned, her nerves easing slightly. “Guess I had to, considering who I’m trying to impress.”</p><p>A server arrived to take their drink orders, leaving them alone in the flickering candlelight. Agatha glanced at the musician, who had started strumming a gentle melody, before turning her attention back to Rio.</p><p>“This place is perfect,” Rio said, her voice low. “It’s got that quiet, mysterious vibe. Very you.”</p><p>“Is that your way of saying you like it?” Agatha asked, her lips twitching.</p><p>Rio shrugged, leaning back in her chair. “Maybe. But don’t let it go to your head.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her smile lingered. “I’ll try to contain myself.”</p><p>Their drinks arrived—a glass of red wine for Agatha and a whiskey neat for Rio—and they clinked their glasses lightly.</p><p>“To...finally getting here,” Rio said, her voice softening.</p><p>Agatha nodded, her gaze steady. “To finally getting here.”</p><p>As the evening unfolded, their conversation flowed easily, the initial tension melting away with every shared smile and laugh. They swapped stories—Rio recounting her most ridiculous reporting mishap (“I ended up in a tree trying to avoid a very angry goose”) and Agatha describing her most absurd law professor (“He spends more time quoting Shakespeare than teaching contracts”).</p><p>Rio laughed, her eyes crinkling at the corners. “So, what you’re saying is, you’re preparing to be a lawyer and a poet?”</p><p>“Something like that,” Agatha said dryly, though her expression softened. “But honestly, I don’t think I’ve laughed this much in weeks.”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened. “That’s the goal.”</p><p>They ordered small plates to share, their conversation punctuated by stolen bites of cheese and flatbread. The music shifted to a soft ballad, the melody wrapping around them like a warm blanket.</p><p>As their laughter faded, a comfortable silence settled over the table. Rio leaned forward slightly, her gaze meeting Agatha’s.</p><p>“I meant what I said earlier,” Rio said softly. “You look amazing tonight.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed, and she glanced down at her wine glass. “You’re not too bad yourself.”</p><p>“Flattery will get you everywhere,” Rio teased, her smile turning playful.</p><p>Agatha smirked, but her voice grew quieter. “I wasn’t expecting this.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “This?”</p><p>“This...feeling,” Agatha admitted, her eyes searching Rio’s. “It’s...nice. Scary, but nice.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened, her hand brushing briefly against Agatha’s on the table. “Same here.”</p><p>The night air was crisp as they stepped out of the café, their footsteps echoing softly on the quiet street. Rio slipped on her leather jacket, her hands tucked into her pockets as they walked side by side.</p><p>“That went well,” Rio said, glancing at Agatha.</p><p>“It did,” Agatha agreed, her lips curving into a small smile. “No major disasters. A first for us.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I don’t know. I’d call tonight a win.”</p><p>As they reached the apartment building, Rio paused at the bottom of the steps, turning to face Agatha. “So, uh...do I get to call this a second date, or should I start planning now?”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow, her smirk teasing. “Let’s see how you handle the rest of tonight first.”</p><p>Rio grinned, leaning closer. “Challenge accepted."</p><p>The elevator ride to their apartment was quiet but not uncomfortable. Agatha stood with her arms crossed, her heels clicking softly against the floor as she shifted her weight. Rio leaned casually against the wall, her hands tucked into the pockets of her leather jacket, a lazy grin playing on her lips.</p><p>As the elevator dinged and the doors opened, Agatha stepped out first, her heels clicking against the hallway tiles. She reached into her purse for the keys, but before she could unlock the door, Rio spoke.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, her grin widening, “are you gonna ask me in for a nightcap, or are we pretending this isn’t a date?”</p><p>Agatha froze, her hand hovering over the lock. She turned slowly, leveling Rio with a deadpan stare. “Rio, we live together. You’re already ‘in.’”</p><p>Rio’s grin didn’t falter. “Doesn’t mean you can’t make it official. C’mon, Harkness, invite me in. Make me feel special.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, suppressing a small smile. “Fine. Rio Vidal, would you like to join me inside the apartment you already live in for a completely unnecessary nightcap?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Thought you’d never ask.”</p><p>Shaking her head, Agatha unlocked the door and stepped inside, flipping on the lights. “You’re impossible,” she muttered as Rio followed her in.</p><p>“And yet, here we are,” Rio said, hanging her jacket on the back of a chair.</p><p>The apartment was quiet, the soft hum of the refrigerator the only sound as they kicked off their shoes. Agatha padded to the kitchen, pulling two glasses from the cabinet and setting them on the counter. She reached for a bottle of wine, pouring a generous amount into each glass before handing one to Rio.</p><p>“To surviving our first date without major disasters,” Agatha said, raising her glass.</p><p>Rio chuckled, clinking her glass against Agatha’s. “Cheers to that.”</p><p>They moved to the living room, settling onto the couch. Rio stretched out, her arm draped lazily over the backrest, while Agatha sat primly with her legs crossed, holding her wine glass carefully.</p><p>“So,” Rio began, her tone teasing, “how’d I do? Did I live up to your impossibly high standards?”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips curving into a faint smirk. “You didn’t trip over yourself, spill anything, or embarrass me in public. I’d call that a success.”</p><p>“High praise from Agatha Harkness,” Rio said, grinning. “I’ll take it.”</p><p>As the conversation shifted from light teasing to something more thoughtful, Agatha found herself relaxing in a way she rarely did. Rio had a way of making even the heaviest topics feel manageable, her humor cutting through the tension without dismissing it.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?” Rio said after a moment, her voice softer.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, her brows furrowing slightly. “Of course.”</p><p>“What made you agree to this?” Rio asked, gesturing between them. “Us, I mean. I know I can be...a lot.”</p><p>Agatha took a sip of her wine, choosing her words carefully. “Because you’re worth it.”</p><p>Rio blinked, caught off guard. “That’s...a bold statement.”</p><p>“It’s true,” Agatha said, her gaze steady. “You’re messy and chaotic and completely exasperating, but you also care more than anyone I’ve ever met. You make me laugh, you make me think, and you make me feel like...like it’s okay to let my guard down.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, her throat tight. “You’re really good at this whole heartfelt confession thing, you know that?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, though her eyes softened. “Don’t get used to it.”</p><p>The conversation slowed, and a comfortable silence settled over the room. Rio set her empty glass on the coffee table and leaned back, her gaze drifting to Agatha.</p><p>“You know,” Rio said, her tone light but teasing, “this whole date thing? We should do it again sometime.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, setting her own glass down. “We’ll see. I don’t want you getting too confident.”</p><p>“Too late,” Rio said, grinning.</p><p>As the night wore on, the edges of their banter softened, and their proximity grew closer. Agatha rested her head against the couch, her expression content, while Rio stretched her legs out, her presence as easy and unguarded as ever.</p><p>For all their differences, they found themselves perfectly at ease, their first date leaving behind not just memories but the promise of something even better to come.</p><p>The room was quiet, the air between them comfortable yet charged with something unspoken. Agatha turned her head to glance at Rio, her gaze falling to the faint outline of the bandage beneath Rio’s shirt.</p><p>“How’s your wound?” Agatha asked softly, breaking the silence.</p><p>Rio shrugged, wincing slightly at the movement. “It’s fine. Healing.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, leaning forward to study her more closely. “You’re still wincing. Did you take your medication?”</p><p>Rio grinned sheepishly. “I might’ve forgotten. It's not exactly advisable to mix medicine with alcohol and I wanted to be lucid tonight thank you very much."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You’re impossible,” she muttered. </p><p>As Agatha sat there, a question lingered on her tongue, one she hadn’t dared to ask until now. She hesitated, her fingers brushing against the fabric of her dress as she searched for the right words.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?” she said finally, her voice quiet.</p><p>“Of course,” Rio replied, her tone turning serious as she caught the shift in Agatha’s demeanor.</p><p>“That night,” Agatha began, her gaze dropping to her hands. “Why did you...why did you do it? Why did you step in like that?”</p><p>Rio blinked, the question catching her off guard. “You mean, why did I save you?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her throat tightening. “You could’ve been killed, Rio. You almost were. Why would you take that risk?”</p><p>Rio leaned back, her eyes softening as she studied Agatha. “Because it’s you.”</p><p>Agatha looked up, her brow furrowing. “That’s not an answer.”</p><p>Rio let out a soft laugh, though there was no humor in it. “It’s the only answer I’ve got, Harkness. I didn’t think about it. I just...acted. Because the thought of something happening to you? I couldn’t live with that.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened, her eyes glistening as she processed Rio’s words. “You’re an idiot,” she said softly, though her voice wavered.</p><p>“Probably,” Rio admitted, her lips curving into a faint smile. “But I’d do it again. A hundred times over.”</p><p>The room fell silent, the weight of Rio’s confession settling between them like a tangible presence. Agatha’s breath hitched as she looked at Rio, her heart pounding in her chest.</p><p>“Rio,” she began, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio replied, her gaze locking onto Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha hesitated for only a moment before leaning in, her movements slow and deliberate. Rio met her halfway, her breath warm against Agatha’s skin as their lips brushed together, tentative at first.</p><p>The kiss deepened, slow and passionate, a shared moment that spoke louder than any words could. Agatha’s hand found its way to Rio’s jaw, her fingers brushing against the curve of her cheek as she poured every unspoken feeling into the kiss. Rio responded in kind, her hand resting lightly on Agatha’s waist, careful not to pull too hard and disturb her wound.</p><p>When they finally broke apart, their foreheads rested against each other, their breaths mingling in the quiet room.</p><p>“Well,” Rio said softly, a playful grin tugging at her lips. “That was...unexpected.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, though her cheeks were flushed. “You’re impossible, I don't think I've said it enough today.”</p><p>“And yet, you kissed me,” Rio teased, her grin widening.</p><p>Agatha smirked, her eyes sparkling. “Don’t get used to it.”</p><p>“Too late,” Rio said, her voice low and warm.</p><p>The silence in the apartment stretched as their gazes locked, the unspoken tension between them thick enough to cut through. Rio, never one to shy away from a moment, leaned in again, her lips brushing softly against Agatha’s. This time, the kiss was deeper, their shared vulnerability giving way to a growing urgency.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled into the fabric of Rio’s shirt as Rio’s hand slid to the small of Agatha’s back, pulling her closer. The world outside their little bubble faded entirely, leaving only the warmth of their connection.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio murmured against her lips, her voice low and filled with something close to awe.</p><p>Agatha shivered at the way her name sounded in Rio’s voice, her grip tightening slightly. “Rio,” she whispered back, her tone carrying both hesitation and want.</p><p>Encouraged, Rio kissed her again, slower this time, as if savoring the moment. But just as the kiss began to deepen further, Agatha pulled back abruptly, her breathing uneven.</p><p>Rio blinked, her brow furrowing in concern. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled deeply, her cheeks flushed as she shook her head. “It’s not that I don’t want this. Trust me, I do.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said slowly, giving her space. “Then what’s stopping you?”</p><p>Agatha glanced away, her lips pressing into a thin line before she finally met Rio’s gaze. “I don’t...sleep with women on the first date.”</p><p>Rio froze for a moment, then let out a soft laugh, the sound full of warmth rather than mockery. “Oh. Okay.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow, slightly defensive. “That’s not a problem, is it? You're hurt and I-”</p><p>“Of course not,” Rio said quickly, her grin softening into something more sincere. “I mean, I didn’t have, like, a checklist for how tonight was supposed to go or anything.”</p><p>Agatha relaxed slightly, though her eyes narrowed playfully. “Good. Because I don’t want you thinking I’m that easy.”</p><p>Rio smirked, leaning back against the couch. “Agatha Harkness, the queen of self-control. You’re making me work for it, huh?”</p><p>“Someone has to keep you on your toes,” Agatha said, though the faint smile tugging at her lips betrayed her amusement.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, studying Agatha with a newfound appreciation. “For the record, I wasn’t expecting anything. Honestly, I’m just happy you said yes to the date. Everything else? That’s just a bonus.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, momentarily caught off guard by Rio’s sincerity. “You mean that?”</p><p>“Every word,” Rio said, her voice steady. “We’ve got time, Agatha. I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha felt her chest tighten, the weight of Rio’s words settling over her. She reached out, her fingers brushing lightly against Rio’s. “You’re not as impossible as I thought.”</p><p>“Don’t ruin my reputation,” Rio teased, though her smile was soft. “But seriously, no pressure. We’re doing this on your terms.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her lips curving into a faint smile. “Thank you.”</p><p>They sat in comfortable silence for a while, their hands lightly intertwined. The earlier tension had shifted into something warmer, steadier—a shared understanding that neither of them needed to rush.</p><p>“So,” Rio said after a moment, her tone teasing again. “Does this mean I’m guaranteed a second date?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t hide her smirk. “I’ll think about it.”</p><p>Rio grinned, leaning closer but stopping just shy of another kiss. “I’m holding you to that.”</p><p>As the night stretched on, they stayed on the couch, talking quietly, their closeness a reminder of how far they’d come—and how much further they wanted to go together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>The apartment was quiet in the soft glow of early morning light. Agatha stretched as she sat up in bed, the faint warmth of last night’s moments with Rio still lingering in her chest. She glanced at the clock on her nightstand and sighed. As much as she wanted to savor the peace, her schedule for the day loomed over her.</p><p>Her phone buzzed loudly against the wood of the nightstand, making her jump. She grabbed it quickly, seeing Wanda’s name flash across the screen. The call ended before she could answer, but not before the sharp ringtone pierced the calm. Agatha frowned at the notification showing several missed calls and texts.</p><p>Buzzing my phone into oblivion won’t make me answer faster, Wanda, she thought with a smirk.</p><p>Slipping out of bed, Agatha padded over to her desk, grabbing a pen and a sticky note. She scribbled down a quick message for Rio and placed it on the counter next to the coffee machine—something she knew Rio wouldn’t miss.</p><p>Agatha reread the note before heading out, nodding to herself.</p><p>Rio,</p><p>Good morning. I have to head to the library to prep for a case and then meet up with Wanda. She’s already called me enough to make my phone nearly vibrate off the nightstand, so I’m guessing she’ll explode if I don’t respond. There’s coffee in the pot. Don’t forget to take your medication.</p><p>—A</p><p>Satisfied, she left the note in plain view and slipped out of the apartment, the door clicking shut softly behind her.</p><p>As Agatha walked to the library, her mind drifted back to the night before. Rio’s teasing grin, the way her eyes softened during their quieter moments—it all felt so new and yet oddly comfortable. Agatha found herself smiling despite the brisk morning air.</p><p>The library came into view, its imposing stone facade catching the morning light. Agatha squared her shoulders, letting the weight of her responsibilities take hold. The case she was preparing for wouldn’t solve itself, and her looming meeting with Wanda promised more teasing than advice.</p><p>Still, she couldn’t shake the feeling that, for the first time in a long time, she was heading into her day with a lightness she hadn’t felt before. And she knew exactly who to thank for that.</p><p>The apartment was quiet when Rio woke up, the soft hum of the city barely audible through the windows. She stretched lazily, her side still tender but manageable, and glanced around for any sign of Agatha. Instead, her eyes landed on the note propped up against the coffee maker on the counter.</p><p>With a yawn, she shuffled over and picked it up, reading Agatha’s familiar handwriting:</p><p>Rio,</p><p>Good morning. I have to head to the library to prep for a case and then meet up with Wanda. She’s already called me enough to make my phone nearly vibrate off the nightstand, so I’m guessing she’ll explode if I don’t respond. There’s coffee in the pot. Don’t forget to take your medication.</p><p>—A</p><p>Rio smiled, folding the note and slipping it into her pocket. She poured herself a cup of coffee, savoring the warmth as she sat at the dining table with her laptop. She had an article draft to finish and figured she might as well make the most of the quiet.</p><p>Her thoughts kept drifting to the night before—the way Agatha’s lips felt against hers, the warmth of her hand on Rio’s cheek. It made focusing on work almost impossible.</p><p>The sharp sound of a knock broke Rio’s concentration. She glanced toward the door, her brow furrowing.</p><p>“Agatha?” she muttered, standing up. “Did you forget something? Or did you miss me already?”</p><p>She smirked at the thought, brushing her hair back as she approached the door. But when she opened it, her heart nearly stopped.</p><p>Standing there was Billy—a familiar face she hadn’t seen in years. His dark curls were messier than she remembered, and his piercing eyes held a mix of mischief and uncertainty. He looked older, taller, but still had that same quiet strength about him.</p><p>“Billy?” Rio whispered, her voice barely audible.</p><p>“Hey, big sis,” Billy said with a small grin, his voice as familiar as the memories that flooded her mind.</p><p>For a moment, Rio was frozen in place, her thoughts flashing back to the foster homes they’d shared. Billy had always been her shadow, following her around and looking up to her like she was some kind of superhero. They had spent countless nights whispering about their dreams, their plans to escape the system and find a place they could call home.</p><p>But then, life happened. They’d been separated when Billy was placed in another home, and despite Rio’s efforts to stay in touch, they’d eventually lost contact.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Rio asked, her voice cracking as she stepped aside to let him in.</p><p>Billy shrugged, his grin fading slightly. “I...I was in town and thought I’d try to find you. Took me a while, but here I am.”</p><p>Rio closed the door, leaning against it as she studied him. “You should’ve called or something.”</p><p>“Didn’t have your number,” Billy admitted. “I found your name in one of your articles. Figured I’d take a chance. You're quite famous around campus, you know”</p><p>They sat at the dining table, Rio’s coffee growing cold as Billy filled her in on the years they’d missed.</p><p>“And you?” Billy asked, his gaze searching hers. “You seem...different. Happier.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, rubbing the back of her neck. “Well, I’ve got a job I love in the university newspaper and I'm going on with my studies. And I live with someone who’s...” She paused, unsure how to describe Agatha. “She’s special.”</p><p>Billy raised an eyebrow, his smirk returning. “Special, huh? Big sis has a girlfriend?”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio muttered, though her cheeks flushed. “It’s new. Complicated.”</p><p>“Doesn’t look complicated from here,” Billy said, leaning back in his chair. “You’re smiling like an idiot.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress the small smile tugging at her lips. “Enough about me. What are you doing for the rest of the day?”</p><p>Billy hesitated, his expression faltering. “Honestly? I don’t have a plan. Just wanted to see you.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened, and she reached out to squeeze his hand. “Well, you’re stuck with me now. Come on, let’s figure something out.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward on her elbows, her coffee forgotten as Billy shared stories of his life in the foster care system. His voice was steady, but there was an underlying weariness that Rio recognized all too well.</p><p>“So, my last foster home?” Billy said, his lips curling into a wry smile. “They had this thing where they locked up the pantry at night. Said it was to ‘encourage discipline.’ Like, I wasn’t gonna starve just because I wanted a snack at midnight.”</p><p>Rio frowned, her hands tightening into fists. “That’s insane. Did anyone report them?”</p><p>Billy shrugged, his grin fading. “Who was I gonna tell? They’re all the same, Rio. Some are just better at hiding it than others.”</p><p>Rio’s chest ached as she listened, the familiar guilt of her own survival pressing down on her. She had always been the one who got out, who moved on, while kids like Billy were left to fend for themselves.</p><p>“I should’ve kept in touch,” Rio said softly, her voice heavy with regret. “I should’ve been there for you.”</p><p>“Hey,” Billy said, his tone turning lighter as he leaned back in his chair. “You had your own stuff to deal with. I’m just glad I found you.”</p><p>The sound of keys rattling at the door froze them both. Rio’s eyes darted to Billy, who immediately tensed, his expression shifting to panic.</p><p>“Who’s that?” Billy whispered, his voice barely audible.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio muttered, her mind racing. “She must’ve finished at the library early.”</p><p>Billy’s hands gripped the edge of the table. “I...I need to hide.”</p><p>“Why?” Rio asked, her brow furrowing.</p><p>Billy hesitated, his voice breaking as he finally confessed. “Because I escaped, okay? I wasn’t supposed to leave my foster home. But I couldn’t stay there, Rio. I had nowhere else to go.”</p><p>Rio’s heart sank as she stared at him, the weight of his words settling like a stone in her chest. She stood quickly, grabbing his arm and pulling him toward her bedroom.</p><p>“Come on,” she whispered urgently, glancing over her shoulder as the door began to open. “We’ll figure this out, but you can’t be here when she sees you.”</p><p>Rio pushed Billy into her room, shutting the door quietly behind them just as Agatha stepped into the apartment. She pressed her back against the door, her mind racing as she tried to come up with a plan.</p><p>Billy sat on the edge of her bed, his hands fidgeting in his lap. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, his voice trembling. “I didn’t mean to drag you into this.”</p><p>“Stop,” Rio said firmly, crouching in front of him. “You’re not dragging me into anything. You needed me, and I’m here. But we need to stay quiet, okay? Let me handle this.”</p><p>Billy nodded, his eyes wide with a mix of fear and gratitude.</p><p>In the living room, Agatha set her bag down on the kitchen counter, her sharp gaze scanning the apartment. “Rio?” she called, her voice carrying a note of curiosity. “You home?”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, steadying herself before cracking the bedroom door open just enough to poke her head out. “Hey, Agatha. You’re back early.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, clearly suspicious. “I thought you’d be working on your article. What are you doing in your room?”</p><p>“Uh, just cleaning up a bit,” Rio said quickly, forcing a casual tone. “You know how messy I can get.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, but she didn’t press the issue. “Right. Well, I’m going to make some tea. Want anything?”</p><p>“No, I’m good,” Rio said, her heart pounding as she watched Agatha move toward the kitchen. “I’ll be out in a bit.”</p><p>As soon as Agatha disappeared from view, Rio closed the door quietly and turned back to Billy. “Okay,” she whispered. “We’ve got some time to figure this out, but we need a plan.”</p><p>Billy nodded, his expression still tense. “I don’t want to get you in trouble, Rio.”</p><p>“You’re not,” Rio said firmly, her voice softening. “We’ll get through this. I promise.”</p><p>Agatha moved to the kitchen, her mind preoccupied with her case notes and Wanda’s endless teasing from earlier in the day. As she reached for the kettle, her eyes caught something out of place—a pair of boots by the door.</p><p>Her brow furrowed. They were worn, scuffed, and definitely not hers. More importantly, they weren’t Rio’s either. Rio’s boots were a signature part of her wardrobe, and these looked smaller, more practical—like something someone younger might wear.</p><p>Agatha turned back toward the living room, her gaze sweeping the apartment. That’s when she noticed it: two mugs on the coffee table. Her heart sank.</p><p>“Okay, maybe she had a friend over,” Agatha muttered to herself, but the thought didn’t sit well. The boots, the mugs—it didn’t add up.</p><p>Her thoughts spiraled as she stood there, staring at the evidence. They hadn’t explicitly discussed exclusivity. Sure, last night had felt special, meaningful even, but had it meant the same to Rio? Or had Rio moved on with her life while Agatha had been foolish enough to think they were building something real?</p><p>Her jaw tightened, and she set the kettle down with more force than necessary. She wasn’t the type to jump to conclusions, but this? This needed answers.</p><p>Agatha strode toward Rio’s room, her heels clicking sharply against the floor. She knocked once, briskly, before pushing the door open just enough to see Rio sitting on the edge of her bed.</p><p>Rio jumped slightly at the sudden intrusion, her expression caught somewhere between nervous and surprised. “Uh, hey. Something wrong?”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, her tone sharper than she intended. “Who’s here?”</p><p>Rio blinked, her mouth opening and closing as if searching for an answer. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Don’t play dumb,” Agatha snapped, stepping inside. “There’s a pair of boots by the door that definitely don’t belong to either of us. And two mugs on the table. Who’s here, Rio?”</p><p>Rio’s face paled slightly, and she stood quickly, blocking the view further into her room. “It’s not what you think.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her heart sinking further. “And what exactly do I think?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her gaze darting to the door behind her. “Look, I can explain, but you need to trust me.”</p><p>“That’s not an explanation,” Agatha shot back, her voice wavering slightly. “If it’s not what I think, then just tell me the truth. Are you seeing someone else? Is that what this is?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, her hands raising defensively. “What? No! It’s not like that at all.”</p><p>“Then what is it?” Agatha demanded, her voice cracking with the weight of her emotions. “Because from where I’m standing, it looks like you’ve been hiding something.”</p><p>Rio let out a frustrated sigh, running a hand through her hair. “Okay, fine. Someone is here. But it’s not what you think. It’s...Billy.”</p><p>“Billy?” Agatha repeated, her anger momentarily giving way to confusion.</p><p>Rio nodded, her voice quieter now. “He’s a kid I used to know in the foster system. He showed up out of nowhere this morning. He’s...he’s in trouble, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s frown deepened. “In trouble how?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her shoulders slumping slightly. “He ran away from his foster home. He’s not supposed to be here, but he didn’t have anywhere else to go.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, the pieces slowly clicking into place. The boots, the extra mug, Rio’s nervousness—it all made sense now. But that didn’t erase the sting of Rio hiding it from her.</p><p>“Why didn’t you just tell me?” Agatha asked, her voice softer but still firm.</p><p>“I didn’t know how,” Rio admitted, her gaze dropping to the floor. “I panicked. And honestly? I wasn’t sure how you’d react.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, the tension in her chest easing slightly. “You should’ve trusted me.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said, her voice barely above a whisper. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha took a step closer, her tone gentler now. “Where is he?”</p><p>Rio glanced toward the closet, her lips twitching into a faint, sheepish smile. “I told him to hide in there.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened slightly. “You hid him in the closet?”</p><p>“It was the only place I could think of!” Rio said defensively, though there was a hint of humor in her tone.</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, shaking her head. “Okay. Let’s get him out and figure out what to do.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her expression softening as she looked at Agatha. “You’re not mad?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m mad,” Agatha said, though her lips curved into a small smile. “But not for the reasons you think. Next time, just talk to me, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded, relief washing over her. “Okay. I promise.”</p><p>Agatha gestured toward the closet. “Now, let’s meet Billy before he suffocates in there.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, turning to open the closet door. As Billy stepped out, looking sheepish but grateful, Agatha crossed her arms, her sharp gaze softening slightly as she looked at him.</p><p>“We’ll figure this out,” Agatha said firmly, her words directed at both of them. “Together.”</p><p>~~~</p><p>The apartment smelled of sautéed garlic and herbs as Agatha stood over the stove, stirring a pan of pasta sauce. The soft hum of the vent and the occasional clatter of utensils filled the air. She glanced at the clock, her brow furrowing slightly. Rio had been in the shower for a while, probably taking her time to unwind after the stressful day.</p><p>The sound of footsteps behind her broke her focus. She turned to see Billy hovering awkwardly near the kitchen table, his hands shoved into the pockets of his jeans.</p><p>“Hey,” Billy said, his tone hesitant. “I, uh, just wanted to say thanks. For, y’know, letting me stay here.”</p><p>Agatha straightened, crossing her arms as she regarded him. “It’s not exactly a five-star hotel, but you’re welcome.”</p><p>Billy grinned, his nervousness fading slightly. “Rio told me you’re not big on spontaneous guests.”</p><p>“Spontaneous is putting it kindly,” Agatha quipped, her lips twitching into a faint smirk. “But I’ll make an exception this time.”</p><p>Billy leaned against the counter, his grin widening. “She’s told me a lot about you, by the way.”</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha said, raising an eyebrow. “Should I be concerned?”</p><p>“Well,” Billy began, drawing out the word, “she mentioned you’re...a little uptight.”</p><p>Agatha paused, the wooden spoon in her hand hovering over the pan. “Uptight?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Billy said, clearly enjoying himself now. “Like, super organized, always following the rules, never stepping out of line. Real fun at parties, I’m sure.”</p><p>Agatha set the spoon down, turning to face him fully. “And here I thought you were here to thank me, not insult me.”</p><p>Billy shrugged, his grin turning mischievous. “Hey, I’m just saying what I heard.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, her expression unimpressed. “Let me guess. Rio also told you she’s the picture of spontaneity and charm?”</p><p>“She might’ve mentioned it,” Billy admitted, his tone teasing. “But between you and me, I think she’s a bit full of herself.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, leaning against the counter. “Finally, something we can agree on.”</p><p>Billy laughed, clearly feeling more at ease. “So, what’s it like living with her? Bet she leaves a trail of chaos everywhere she goes.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Chaos doesn’t even begin to cover it. It’s like living with a tornado that insists on singing off-key at 2 a.m.”</p><p>Billy snorted. “Sounds about right. And you? What’s your thing? Do you, like, alphabetize your spice rack for fun?”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow, her tone dripping with sarcasm. “Of course. Doesn’t everyone?”</p><p>Billy grinned, clearly amused. “Man, you’re even snarkier than Rio said.”</p><p>“I prefer to think of it as ‘quick-witted,’” Agatha replied smoothly. “But sure, let’s go with snarky.”</p><p>Billy hesitated for a moment, his grin softening into something more genuine. “You know, she really likes you.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “What?”</p><p>“Rio,” Billy said, his voice quieter now. “She talks about you a lot. Like, a lot. It’s obvious how much she cares.”</p><p>Agatha felt a warmth rise in her chest, though she quickly masked it with a casual shrug. “Well, she’s not the worst person I’ve ever lived with.”</p><p>Billy smirked. “High praise coming from you.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her tone softened. “For what it’s worth, she’s lucky to have someone like you in her corner. And so am I.”</p><p>Billy’s grin returned, though there was a hint of shyness to it now. “Thanks. That means a lot.”</p><p>Before either of them could say more, the sound of the bathroom door opening filled the apartment. Rio appeared moments later, her hair damp and her cheeks flushed from the heat of the shower. She glanced between Billy and Agatha, her brow raising suspiciously.</p><p>“What’s going on here?” Rio asked, her tone teasing.</p><p>“Just bonding,” Agatha said, turning back to the stove. “You’re not the only one with charm, you know.”</p><p>Billy grinned. “Yeah, she’s pretty cool. For someone who alphabetizes her spice rack.”</p><p>Rio laughed, her eyes sparkling as she looked at Agatha. “Oh, she told you about that, huh?”</p><p>Agatha groaned, shaking her head. “I’m surrounded by children.”</p><p>The three of them sat around the small dining table, the warm scent of Agatha’s pasta dish filling the room. Billy, who had initially been a little shy, was now completely at ease, chatting animatedly as he devoured his plate. Rio laughed at his jokes and stories, her mood light despite the tension she must’ve been feeling earlier.</p><p>Agatha, however, ate in relative silence, her sharp gaze flicking between the two. She didn’t want to ruin the evening, but the weight of the situation lingered in her mind like an unspoken storm cloud. Still, as she watched Billy laugh for the first time since arriving, she found herself softening—just a little.</p><p>“Okay, who’s ready for seconds?” Agatha asked, standing and gathering plates.</p><p>“Me!” Billy said enthusiastically, raising his hand.</p><p>Rio smirked. “You’ve got an endless pit for a stomach, don’t you?”</p><p>“Hey, I’m still growing,” Billy shot back, grinning.</p><p>Agatha returned with more food, setting it in front of him. “Here. Just don’t eat the table while you’re at it.”</p><p>Billy laughed, shaking his head. “You’re funny, Agatha. I didn’t expect that.”</p><p>“Neither did I,” Rio teased, earning a half-hearted glare from Agatha.</p><p>The dinner continued with lighthearted banter, and for a moment, it almost felt normal. But Agatha couldn’t shake the nagging thought at the back of her mind: they couldn’t keep this up forever.</p><p>Later that night, after Billy had finally fallen asleep on the couch, Agatha found Rio in the kitchen, rinsing the dishes. The apartment was quiet, save for the sound of running water and the occasional soft creak of the floorboards.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the counter, crossing her arms. “We need to talk about Billy.”</p><p>Rio stiffened slightly, but she didn’t look up. “What about him?”</p><p>“You know what,” Agatha said, her voice steady but firm. “We can’t just keep him here, Rio. We need to call his foster home or the authorities.”</p><p>Rio turned off the faucet and set the dish in the drying rack, her movements deliberate. She finally looked at Agatha, her expression guarded. “No. We’re not doing that.”</p><p>“Rio—” Agatha began, but Rio cut her off.</p><p>“You don’t understand,” Rio said, her tone sharp. “You don’t know what it’s like in the system. How bad it can be.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed, but she didn’t interrupt as Rio continued, her voice rising slightly with emotion.</p><p>“Do you know how many nights I cried myself to sleep because the people who were supposed to take care of me didn’t give a damn? How many times I went hungry because they locked the kitchen? Or how many times I was shoved aside, treated like I was nothing?” Rio’s hands clenched into fists at her sides. “Billy’s been through the same thing. Probably worse. And you want me to send him back to that?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “I’m not saying it’s fair. I’m not saying the system is good. But if someone finds out he’s here, we could be in serious trouble. You, me, even Billy.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, her jaw tightening. “So what? We’re supposed to just hand him over and hope for the best? I can’t do that, Agatha. I won’t.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, her chest tightening at the raw emotion in Rio’s voice. “You think keeping him here is the solution?”</p><p>“For now, yes,” Rio said firmly. “At least he’s safe here. At least he knows someone cares.”</p><p>Agatha ran a hand through her hair, pacing the kitchen. She knew Rio was right—at least partially. The system was broken, and kids like Billy often fell through the cracks. But the risks were too great, and Agatha couldn’t ignore them.</p><p>“You’re asking a lot,” Agatha said quietly. “If this goes wrong, it could ruin everything—for all of us.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said, her voice softening. “But he’s just a kid, Agatha. He doesn’t have anyone else.”</p><p>Agatha stopped pacing, her gaze locking onto Rio’s. The desperation in her eyes was undeniable, and for a moment, all of Agatha’s carefully constructed logic wavered.</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha said finally, her tone begrudging. “He can stay. But only for a few days. And you need to figure out what to do next. We can’t make this permanent, Rio.”</p><p>Rio nodded, relief washing over her. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Don’t thank me yet,” Agatha muttered, shaking her head. “This isn’t going to be easy.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, stepping closer. “Nothing worth doing ever is.”</p><p>As the two women stood in the dimly lit kitchen, the tension between them eased slightly. Agatha leaned back against the counter, her arms crossed, while Rio leaned forward on her palms, her gaze thoughtful.</p><p>“Just...promise me you’ll be careful,” Agatha said after a moment. “No risks. No unnecessary drama.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I promise."</p><p>Agatha sighed, the weight of the situation settling heavily on her shoulders. “Let’s just hope we don’t regret this.”</p><p>Rio reached out, brushing her fingers lightly against Agatha’s arm. “We won’t. I won’t let that happen.”</p><p>For all her doubts, Agatha couldn’t help but believe her.</p>

<p>The apartment was still cloaked in early morning light as Agatha moved about the kitchen. The smell of fresh coffee and frying eggs filled the air, and she hummed quietly to herself as she worked. Billy was still asleep on the couch, his breathing steady, while Rio was likely still sprawled out in her room, enjoying the rare chance to sleep in.</p><p>Agatha glanced at the clock and frowned. She had completely forgotten about her plans with Wanda until now, and she knew it was only a matter of time before Wanda came knocking. Sure enough, as if summoned by the thought, a sharp knock echoed through the apartment.</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha muttered, setting down the spatula and wiping her hands on a dish towel. She hurried to the door, opening it just enough to see Wanda standing there, looking unimpressed.</p><p>“You’re late,” Wanda said, crossing her arms. “We were supposed to leave twenty minutes ago.”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “I know, I know. Just...give me a few minutes. I’m finishing breakfast.”</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “Breakfast? For who?”</p><p>Before Agatha could answer, Wanda’s gaze shifted over her shoulder, landing on Billy, who was still sprawled on the couch, snoring softly. Her eyes widened, and she pointed. “And who, pray tell, is that?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss a beat. “My new pet,” she said dryly, her lips curving into a faint smirk.</p><p>Wanda blinked, clearly caught off guard. “Your what?”</p><p>“My new pet,” Agatha repeated, her tone teasing as she stepped back to let Wanda in. “Found him wandering around and decided to keep him.”</p><p>Wanda narrowed her eyes, stepping closer to get a better look at Billy. “He’s not a stray, Agatha. He’s a human.”</p><p>“Observant as always,” Agatha said, walking back to the kitchen to flip the eggs in the pan. “He’s a...temporary houseguest.”</p><p>Wanda followed her, leaning against the counter with a look of suspicion. “Temporary houseguest? Does Rio know about this?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a pointed look. “Of course she does. It’s complicated, okay?”</p><p>Wanda crossed her arms, her curiosity piqued. “Oh, I’m sure it is. Care to elaborate?”</p><p>“Not particularly,” Agatha replied, her smirk returning. “But don’t worry, it’s nothing illegal. Mostly.”</p><p>“Mostly?” Wanda repeated, her voice rising slightly. “Agatha, what are you—”</p><p>“Relax,” Agatha said, waving a hand dismissively. “Everything’s under control.”</p><p>Wanda looked far from convinced but let the subject drop for now. “Fine. But I want the full story later.”</p><p>“Of course you do,” Agatha muttered, turning off the stove and plating the food. “Now, give me five minutes to finish this and get ready. I haven’t forgotten about our shopping plans.”</p><p>As Agatha disappeared down the hallway to get dressed, Wanda wandered back to the living room, her gaze lingering on Billy. He stirred slightly, blinking up at her groggily.</p><p>“Morning,” Billy mumbled, his voice thick with sleep.</p><p>“Morning,” Wanda replied, her tone curious. “You must be...Agatha’s new ‘pet.’”</p><p>Billy blinked, sitting up slowly. “She said that?”</p><p>“Her exact words,” Wanda said, her lips twitching into a faint smile. “You’re not actually her pet, are you?”</p><p>Billy laughed softly, rubbing the back of his neck. “No, just a...friend of Rio’s. Passing through.”</p><p>“Passing through, huh?” Wanda raised an eyebrow, but her tone remained light. “Well, you’ve got better manners than most of the people Agatha puts up with. I’ll give you that.”</p><p>Billy grinned, his nerves easing slightly. “Thanks, I guess.”</p><p>Agatha reappeared a few minutes later, her hair neatly combed and a light jacket thrown over her shoulders. She glanced between Wanda and Billy, her brow raising slightly. “You two getting along?”</p><p>“Swimmingly,” Wanda said, her tone dripping with sarcasm. “Now, can we go? Or do you have more strays to pick up?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, grabbing her purse. “Let’s go before I change my mind.”</p><p>As she moved toward the door, she glanced over her shoulder at Billy. “There’s breakfast on the counter. Don’t let Rio eat all of it.”</p><p>Billy saluted her lazily. “Got it boss"</p><p>Agatha smirked, opening the door for Wanda. “See you later, Billy.”</p><p>Wanda followed her out, shaking her head. “You have some explaining to do, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “I always do.”</p><p>Billy sat at the dining table, finishing the breakfast that Agatha had prepared before she left with Wanda. The remains of eggs and toast were on his plate as he leaned back in his chair, sipping a glass of orange juice. The apartment was quiet except for the soft sound of the city outside.</p><p>The door to Rio’s room creaked open, and she stumbled out, still half-asleep. Her hair was a mess, and she rubbed her eyes as she made her way to the kitchen.</p><p>“Morning, big sis,” Billy said, grinning at her.</p><p>Rio stopped in her tracks, her eyes narrowing at him. “How are you so awake already?”</p><p>“I had breakfast,” Billy said, holding up his empty plate. “Agatha made it. Pretty good, too. You snooze, you lose.”</p><p>Rio groaned, grabbing a mug and pouring herself a cup of coffee. “She’s showing you up. You’re gonna think she’s the better big sister now.”</p><p>Billy laughed. “She’s cool, but you’ve got the edge. She’s way too...neat.”</p><p>Rio smirked, sipping her coffee as she leaned against the counter. “Told you. Too uptight.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Billy said, setting his glass down. “But I kinda like her snark.”</p><p>Rio joined Billy at the table, cradling her coffee mug as they talked. Their conversation was light, filled with teasing and shared memories of their time in the foster system. Billy shared some of his more recent adventures—most of them less than ideal—but he spoke with a resilience that Rio recognized all too well.</p><p>“So, how long are you gonna keep hiding out here?” Rio asked, her tone casual but her eyes serious.</p><p>Billy shrugged. “I don’t know. A couple of days? Until I figure out my next move.”</p><p>Rio frowned but didn’t push him. “Well, you’re safe here. That’s what matters.”</p><p>Billy gave her a small smile. “Thanks, Rio. I mean it.”</p><p>Rio reached out, ruffling his hair. “Don’t get all mushy on me, kid.”</p><p>As they finished their coffee, Rio stood and stretched, glancing at the clock. “Alright, here’s the deal. I’ve got a ton of work to do, so I’m gonna lock myself in my room for a few hours and blast some music to help me focus.”</p><p>Billy raised an eyebrow. “What am I supposed to do? Stare at the wall?”</p><p>“Exactly,” Rio deadpanned, smirking when Billy rolled his eyes. “You’ve got options. Watch TV, scroll through your phone, or—better yet—order a pizza for lunch. I left some menus on the counter.”</p><p>Billy perked up at the mention of pizza. “Now we’re talking.”</p><p>Rio grabbed her phone and tossed it to him. “Here. Put your number in so you can text me if you need anything. Emergencies only, though.”</p><p>Billy caught the phone and started typing. “Define ‘emergency.’”</p><p>Rio grinned. “You’re out of pizza, or the building’s on fire.”</p><p>Billy laughed, handing the phone back to her. “Got it. Pizza first, fire second.”</p><p>Rio disappeared into her room, shutting the door behind her. She pulled on her headphones and opened her laptop, ready to dive into her work. The sounds of the apartment faded away as she focused, her fingers flying over the keyboard.</p><p>Meanwhile, Billy lounged on the couch, flipping through the pizza menus Rio had left. For the first time in a long time, he felt a sense of ease—a fleeting but precious moment of normalcy.</p><p>Billy was scrolling through his phone while a TV show played faintly in the background. The knock at the door startled him, and he sat up, his stomach growling. He smiled, assuming it was the pizza he had ordered earlier, and texted Rio.</p><p><em>Billy: Pizza’s here. I’ll grab it</em>. </p><p>Leaving his phone on the couch, he stood and made his way to the door. He grasped the doorknob just as his phone buzzed again on the couch, but he didn’t bother checking the message.</p><p>In her room, Rio’s phone vibrated on her desk, drawing her attention. She saw Billy’s message and her eyes widened.</p><p>
<em>Rio: Don’t open the door! Wait for me!</em>
</p><p>Panic surged through her as she ripped off her headphones and rushed to stand. But as she turned too quickly, she miscalculated the edge of her desk, slamming her side against the sharp corner. The pain shot through her like fire, and she doubled over, clutching her wound and biting back a scream.</p><p>“Damn it,” she hissed through clenched teeth, trying to steady her breathing. She pressed her hand tightly against her side, forcing herself to take a few deep breaths and wait for the pain to subside before she could move again.</p><p>Meanwhile, Billy had already unlocked the door. He opened it casually, expecting to see a delivery person holding a pizza box. Instead, he was met with a tall, impeccably dressed woman whose presence radiated an unsettling authority.</p><p>She looked down at him with a sharp, calculating gaze, her dark eyes narrowing slightly. “Who are you?”</p><p>Billy froze, taken aback by the woman’s question and the intensity of her stare. He blinked, his hand still on the doorknob. “Uh...who are you?”</p><p>The woman tilted her head slightly, her lips curving into a faint, humorless smile. “I asked you first.”</p><p>Billy straightened, trying to summon some confidence. “This is Rio’s apartment. You’ve got the wrong place.”</p><p>“Is that so?” the woman said, her tone cold and condescending. She stepped forward slightly, her sharp heels clicking on the hallway floor. “Then tell me, what exactly are you doing here?”</p><p>“I could ask you the same thing,” Billy shot back, his nerves bubbling under his bravado.</p><p>The woman’s smile widened, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “How quaint. But I think you’re mistaken. This isn’t Rio’s apartment. This belongs to my daughter, Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>Billy’s jaw dropped slightly as realization hit. “Wait, you’re...her mother?”</p><p>“Evanora Harkness,” she said, her name as sharp as a blade. She leaned closer, her eyes narrowing. “Now, who the hell are you?”</p><p>Before Billy could answer, Rio appeared in the doorway, leaning heavily against the wall as she steadied herself. Her face was pale, but her voice was firm. “Billy, step back.”</p><p>Billy glanced at her, his relief palpable. “Uh, yeah. Sure.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze locked onto Evanora, her eyes narrowing despite the obvious pain she was in. “And you must be Evanora. What are you doing here?”</p><p>Evanora’s lips twitched into a faint, icy smile. “Ah, you must be the infamous Rio who lives in my daughter's apartment according to the young man.”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, ignoring the throbbing in her side. “Great. Now, why are you here?”</p><p>Evanora tilted her head, her expression unreadable. “A mother can’t visit her daughter?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked to Billy, then back to Evanora. “Agatha’s not home. You’ll have to come back later.”</p><p>Evanora’s icy smile faded, her expression darkening. “Not home? And where exactly is my daughter, then?”</p><p>“That’s none of your business,” Rio shot back, crossing her arms despite the throbbing in her side. “You should leave.”</p><p>Evanora took a step closer, her eyes narrowing. “You must be Agatha’s...roommate, I presume?”</p><p>“Partner,” Rio corrected sharply, her tone leaving no room for argument. “Now, like I said, Agatha’s not here.”</p><p>Evanora’s demeanor shifted, her anger bubbling just beneath the surface. “It’s disgraceful, really. Agatha avoiding her own mother. And you—” She turned her gaze back to Billy, her sharp eyes scanning him. “You look...oddly familiar.”</p><p>Billy stiffened under her scrutiny, his earlier confidence evaporating. “I don’t know you, lady.”</p><p>Rio stepped protectively in front of him, her voice rising. “Enough. Leave him out of this.”</p><p>Evanora’s calm facade cracked, and she snapped at Rio, her voice venomous. “You think you can stand there and tell me what to do? You don’t know me, girl. You don’t know what I’ve done for Agatha.”</p><p>Rio’s anger boiled over, and she stepped forward, her eyes blazing. “What you’ve done for Agatha? Are you serious? You ruined her life!”</p><p>Evanora’s eyes widened in shock, but Rio wasn’t finished. She jabbed a finger in Evanora’s direction, her voice trembling with rage as her arms flailed sending sharp pains through her whole body. “You abused her! You tore her down every chance you got, made her feel like she was worthless! And now, you have the nerve to show up here, acting like you care?”</p><p>Evanora’s mouth opened, but Rio didn’t give her the chance to respond. “Agatha doesn’t owe you anything. She’s better off without you, and honestly, so am I. So why don’t you do us all a favor and stay the hell away from this apartment—and her life!”</p><p>Evanora’s face twisted in a mixture of fury and disbelief. She opened her mouth to speak, but Rio’s glare silenced her. For a moment, the tension in the air was suffocating, and then Evanora’s lips pressed into a thin line.</p><p>“Fine,” she said coldly, adjusting her coat. “I’ll leave. But don’t think for a second that this is over.”</p><p>She turned on her heel and walked away, her sharp footsteps echoing down the hallway. Rio stood in the doorway, breathing heavily as she watched her retreat.</p><p>Billy stared at Rio, his eyes wide. “Wow. That was...intense.”</p><p>Rio leaned against the wall, her hand pressed against her side. “Yeah. Sorry you had to see that.”</p><p>“Don’t apologize,” Billy said, stepping closer. “She deserved it. You were amazing.”</p><p>Rio let out a shaky laugh, the adrenaline slowly fading. “I don’t feel amazing. I feel like I might pass out.”</p><p>Billy frowned, his concern evident. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“I’ll be fine,” Rio muttered, straightening with effort. “Just...promise me one thing.”</p><p>“Anything,” Billy said quickly.</p><p>“If she ever comes back,” Rio said, her voice firm, “don’t open the door.”</p><p>Billy nodded, his expression serious. “Got it.”</p><p>Rio sighed, pushing the door shut and locking it. She leaned against it for a moment, closing her eyes. The encounter had shaken her more than she wanted to admit, but one thing was clear: Evanora wasn’t going to make their lives any easier.</p><p>Billy stared at Rio, his eyes wide, as the tension in the room began to settle. “Wow. She's quite the bitch.”</p><p>Rio leaned heavily against the wall, her hand still pressed protectively against her side. Her breathing was shallow, and her voice came out strained. “Yeah. Sorry you had to see that.”</p><p>“Don’t apologize,” Billy said, stepping closer with concern. “She deserved it. You were amazing.”</p><p>Rio let out a shaky laugh, her bravado faltering. “I don’t feel amazing."</p><p>Billy’s brow furrowed as his gaze dropped to her hand. “Uh, Rio...you’re bleeding.”</p><p>Rio blinked, her adrenaline fading fully as she registered the sharp, warm sensation beneath her palm. She pulled her hand away slightly, revealing a dark red stain spreading across her shirt. Her stitches had torn, and the blood was quickly soaking through the fabric.</p><p>“Shit,” she muttered, her voice weaker now. She swayed slightly, her knees threatening to give out.</p><p>“Whoa, whoa!” Billy said, rushing to her side and grabbing her arm to steady her. “You’re bleeding a lot. We need to get you to the couch—now.”</p><p>Billy helped Rio limp to the couch, his own fear rising as he saw how much blood was soaking through her shirt. Rio collapsed onto the cushions, her face pale as she clutched her side.</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Billy muttered, his voice trembling as he looked around. “What do I do? Towels? Bandages?”</p><p>Rio waved a weak hand toward the bathroom. “Under...the sink. First aid kit.”</p><p>Billy nodded and sprinted to the bathroom, nearly tripping over his own feet. He yanked open the cabinet and grabbed the kit before rushing back to Rio. His hands shook as he opened it, pulling out gauze and antiseptic.</p><p>“I don’t know what I’m doing,” Billy admitted, panic creeping into his voice.</p><p>“You’re...doing fine,” Rio murmured, her voice faint but steady. “Just press...the gauze. Hard.”</p><p>Billy swallowed hard, pressing the gauze firmly against her wound. Rio winced, a sharp intake of breath escaping her lips, but she didn’t complain. Billy’s hands were clammy as he worked, his focus laser-sharp despite his fear.</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Billy said, his voice shaky but determined. “It’s slowing down. That’s good, right?”</p><p>Rio nodded weakly, her eyelids fluttering. “Good. Just...don’t faint on me.”</p><p>Billy forced a laugh, though it sounded more like a sob. “Only if you promise you won't either.”</p><p>As Billy held the gauze in place, he glanced toward Rio’s phone on the coffee table. “I should call someone. Agatha?”</p><p>Rio shook her head slightly, though it seemed to take all her energy. “No...not yet. Just...keep pressure.”</p><p>Billy hesitated, torn between following her instructions and reaching out for help. “You’re bleeding, Rio. I don’t think this is something I can fix.”</p><p>“Billy,” Rio said, her voice barely above a whisper. “You’re doing...great. Just...stay with me.”</p><p>He clenched his jaw, nodding as he focused on her wound. “Okay. But if this gets worse, I’m calling someone. I mean it.”</p><p>Rio managed a faint smile. “Deal.”</p>

<p>The bustling sound of the mall surrounded Agatha and Wanda as they strolled through a trendy clothing store. Wanda’s scarlet hair caught the light, making her stand out as she flipped through racks of dresses with practiced ease. Agatha trailed behind, arms crossed, her expression somewhere between bored and mildly amused.</p><p>“You know, this is the exact kind of torture I try to avoid,” Agatha muttered, eyeing a particularly gaudy sequined dress that Wanda was holding up.</p><p>“Oh, please,” Wanda said, rolling her eyes. “You’re just mad you can’t look this good in sequins.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t even try,” Agatha replied dryly. “It’s not a loss.”</p><p>Wanda grinned, holding up another dress. “What do you think? Too much for dinner and a movie?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, pretending to scrutinize it. “Depends. Are you going to a movie or headlining a Vegas show?”</p><p>Wanda gasped dramatically, clutching the dress to her chest. “The betrayal! And here I thought you’d be supportive.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, shaking her head. “You know I support you, Maximoff. Just not in that.”</p><p>As Wanda finally settled on a simpler, more elegant dress, she turned her attention back to Agatha, her eyes narrowing playfully. “Speaking of support, what’s the deal with the kid on your couch?”</p><p>Agatha froze, her expression guarded. “What about him?”</p><p>“Oh, come on,” Wanda said, leaning against the counter as they waited to check out. “You’ve been all mysterious about it. Who is he? Where did he come from? And why does he look like he’s auditioning for a heartwarming sitcom about found families?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “He’s a friend of Rio’s. From the foster system, apparently.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyebrows shot up. “A foster kid? And he’s staying with you? Oh, this is too good.”</p><p>“Don’t start,” Agatha warned, her tone sharp but not unkind.</p><p>Wanda grinned mischievously. “I’m just saying, you’ve gone soft. Next thing I know, you’ll be adopting stray cats and knitting sweaters for them.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a glare. “He’s staying temporarily. That’s it. Don’t read into it.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Wanda said, clearly unconvinced. “And how’s Rio handling all this? I mean, big sister vibes aside, she’s not exactly the picture of stability.”</p><p>Agatha sighed again, her shoulders relaxing slightly. “She’s doing her best. She cares about him, and...I get it. I do.”</p><p>Wanda softened, her teasing tone fading for a moment. “You’re a good person, Agatha. Under all that sarcasm and snark, you’ve got a heart.”</p><p>“Don’t ruin my reputation,” Agatha muttered, though her lips twitched into a faint smile.</p><p>As they exited the store, Wanda’s mischievous grin returned. “So, about Billy...what’s he think of you?”</p><p>Agatha frowned, glancing at her. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“I mean,” Wanda said, her voice dripping with amusement, “does he think you’re, like, the cool, mysterious roommate? Or does he know you’re secretly a control freak who alphabetizes her spice rack?”</p><p>“I don’t- Ugh!” Agatha replied groaning .</p><p>“Right...” Wanda shot back, laughing. “Seriously, though, he seems sweet. You should let him stay longer.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, her expression firm. “A few days. That’s all. I’m not running a foster home.”</p><p>“No,” Wanda said, smirking. “But you are running a circus.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, rubbing her temples. “Remind me why I agreed to this shopping trip?”</p><p>“Because you love me,” Wanda said, linking her arm through Agatha’s. “And because you owe me for bailing you out of countless awkward situations.”</p><p>“Fair enough,” Agatha muttered, though her lips twitched into another reluctant smile.</p><p>As they continued through the mall, Wanda turned the conversation back to her date, excitedly describing her plans and what she hoped to wear. Agatha nodded along, offering the occasional sarcastic comment but genuinely listening.</p><p>Still, in the back of her mind, she couldn’t shake a nagging feeling of unease. She wasn’t sure why, but something about leaving Billy and Rio alone at the apartment made her chest tighten. She pushed the thought aside, reminding herself that they were adults—or at least close enough.</p><p>For now, she’d focus on surviving the rest of the shopping trip with Wanda.</p><p>Agatha and Wanda strolled down the bustling street, bags in hand, their earlier banter still lingering in the air. The sun was beginning to dip lower, casting long shadows across the pavement. Agatha glanced at a lamppost as they passed and froze mid-step.</p><p>“Holy crap,” she muttered under her breath.</p><p>Wanda stopped, looking at her curiously. “What? Did you see another sequin disaster?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She stepped closer to the lamppost, her eyes widening as she stared at a poster taped to it. The image was unmistakable: Billy’s face, slightly younger but still recognizably him, stared back at her. Below it, bold letters read:</p><p>
<strong>MISSING: William “Billy” Kaplan</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Age: 16</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Last seen near St. Andrews Foster Home</strong>
</p><p><strong>If found, contact local authorities immediately</strong>.</p><p>“Wanda,” Agatha said, her voice low and tense, “we need to get home. Now.”</p><p>Wanda stepped up beside her, her brow furrowing as she scanned the poster. “Wait, is that—”</p><p>“It’s Billy,” Agatha confirmed, her heart racing. She tore her gaze from the poster, scanning the surrounding area. There were more of them, plastered on lampposts, bulletin boards, and even the windows of nearby shops.</p><p>Wanda’s eyes widened. “Agatha, this is bad. If someone recognizes him—”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha snapped, already pulling out her phone. Her fingers hovered over Rio’s number when a new text popped up. It wasn’t from Rio—it was from Rio’s phone, but the message was clearly from Billy.</p><p>Billy: Rio’s bleeding. Her stitches broke, and I don’t know what to do. Please help.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped. “Double crap.”</p><p>Wanda stared at her, concern etched on her face. “What now?”</p><p>“Billy just texted me,” Agatha said, her voice tight. “Rio’s stitches broke, and she’s bleeding. We need to get back. Fast.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed Wanda’s arm, her pace quickening as she weaved through the crowd. Her mind was a blur of worry and adrenaline, the combination of the posters and Billy’s message making her heart pound.</p><p>“Do you think anyone’s recognized him?” Wanda asked, trying to keep up.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha replied, her tone clipped. “But we can’t take any chances.”</p><p>“And Rio? How bad is it?” Wanda pressed.</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw. “If Billy’s texting me, it’s bad. He wouldn’t do that unless he was desperate.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her expression serious. “Okay, let’s focus. We’ll deal with the posters after we make sure Rio’s okay.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a grateful glance, her steps quickening. “Right. First things first.”</p><p>When they finally reached the apartment building, Agatha barely paused to catch her breath. She fumbled with her keys, her hands shaking slightly as she unlocked the door and pushed it open.</p><p>“Billy?” she called out, her voice sharp. “Rio?”</p><p>Billy appeared in the doorway of the living room, his face pale and his hands stained with blood. “Thank God you’re here,” he said, relief flooding his voice. “She’s in her room. It’s bad.”</p><p>Agatha handed her shopping bags to Wanda without a word and rushed toward Rio’s room. The door was open, and Rio was lying on the bed, her face pale and her breathing shallow. Blood soaked the bandages Billy had hastily applied to her side, and she grimaced in pain as she turned her head toward Agatha.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, her voice trembling but steady. “What the hell happened?”</p><p>Rio managed a weak smile, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “Desk corner. Not my best move. Billy put some bandages but I think i might have stained them...”</p><p>“Clearly,” Agatha muttered, her eyes scanning the wound. “Billy, get me the first aid kit. Now.”</p><p>Billy nodded and darted out of the room, returning moments later with the kit. Agatha grabbed it and got to work, carefully removing the blood-soaked bandages and replacing them with fresh ones. Rio hissed in pain but didn’t complain.</p><p>“You need stitches again,” Agatha said grimly, her hands steady as she worked. “We can’t handle this here.”</p><p>Rio shook her head weakly. “No hospital.”</p><p>“You don’t have a choice,” Agatha snapped, her worry spilling over into frustration. “You’re bleeding too much.”</p><p>Wanda was catching Billy up considering the posters they found on their way home. </p><p>Billy spoke up, his voice hesitant. “What if...what if someone sees me? The posters—”</p><p>Agatha froze for a moment, then let out a shaky breath. “We’ll figure it out. But right now, we need to focus on Rio.”</p><p>Wanda stepped into the room, her expression grave. “Agatha, if she’s not going to the hospital, we need someone who knows what they’re doing.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then nodded. “I’ll call someone. An old friend. They owe me a favor.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to protest, but Agatha silenced her with a glare. “Don’t argue. You’re in no condition to fight me right now.”</p><p>Rio sighed, leaning back against the pillows. “Fine. But this better not come back to bite us.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched into a faint, reassuring smile. “It won’t. Trust me.”</p><p>As she stepped out of the room to make the call, her mind raced. Between Rio’s injury and the posters of Billy, the stakes had never been higher. But one thing was clear: she would do whatever it took to protect the people she cared about.</p><p>Agatha stepped into the living room, her phone clutched tightly in her hand as she scrolled through her contacts. Wanda and Billy stayed behind in Rio’s room, working to keep her as comfortable as possible. Agatha’s fingers hovered over a name in her phone—Jennifer Kale—before she hit the call button.</p><p>The line rang twice before a cheerful voice answered. “Hey, Agatha! What’s up?”</p><p>“Jen,” Agatha said, her voice tight and urgent. “I need your help. It’s an emergency.”</p><p>Jen’s tone shifted immediately, turning serious. “What’s going on? Are you okay?”</p><p>“It’s not me,” Agatha explained quickly. “It’s my roomm- my girlfri- my- Rio. She tore her stitches, and she’s bleeding a lot. I need someone who knows what they’re doing.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen began hesitantly, “if it’s that bad, you need to take her to the hospital.”</p><p>“We can’t,” Agatha snapped, pacing the room. “It’s...complicated. Please, Jen. I wouldn’t be asking if I had another option.”</p><p>There was a long pause on the other end of the line. Finally, Jen sighed. “Where are you?”</p><p>Agatha felt a wave of relief wash over her. “At my apartment. You know the address.”</p><p>“Okay,” Jen said firmly. “I’m on my way. But you owe me for this, Agatha.”</p><p>“Believe me, I know,” Agatha said, her voice softening slightly. “Thank you, Jen.”</p><p>“Don’t thank me yet,” Jen replied before hanging up.</p><p>About twenty minutes later, there was a knock at the door. Agatha rushed to open it, revealing Jen standing there with a medical bag slung over her shoulder. </p><p>“Show me where she is,” Jen said, stepping inside without hesitation.</p><p>Agatha led her to Rio’s room, where Wanda and Billy stepped aside to make space. Rio glanced up at Jen, her face pale but her eyes filled with curiosity. “Who’s the new recruit?”</p><p>“I’m Jen,” the doctor-in-training said, pulling out gloves and supplies from her bag. “Agatha’s friend and soon to be pediatric surgeon. And apparently, your stitch-fixer.”</p><p>“Lucky me,” Rio muttered, wincing as Jen sat beside her.</p><p>Jen worked quickly and efficiently, cleaning the wound and preparing fresh sutures. Agatha hovered nearby, her arms crossed as she watched, her face a mask of worry.</p><p>“Rio,” Jen said gently, “this is going to hurt, but I’ll be as quick as I can.”</p><p>Rio nodded, biting her lip. “Do what you gotta do.”</p><p>Jen’s hands were steady as she stitched the wound, her movements precise. Rio hissed in pain but stayed remarkably still, her jaw clenched tightly.</p><p>“You’re tough,” Jen said, glancing at her with a faint smile. “Most people would be screaming by now.”</p><p>“Years of practice,” Rio quipped, though her voice was strained.</p><p>Billy shifted nervously in the corner, his hands fidgeting. Wanda placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, whispering something too low for Agatha to hear.</p><p>When Jen finished, she carefully bandaged the wound and packed up her supplies. “She’ll need to take it easy for the next few days. No heavy lifting, no sudden movements. And make sure she keeps the area clean.”</p><p>“She will,” Agatha said firmly, shooting a pointed look at Rio, who rolled her eyes.</p><p>Jen stood and turned to Agatha, lowering her voice. “You want to tell me what’s really going on? Because this whole situation screams ‘not normal.’”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, running a hand through her hair. “It’s...complicated. Just trust me when I say it’s better if no one knows.”</p><p>Jen frowned but nodded. “Fine. But if this happens again, I’m dragging her to the hospital myself.”</p><p>“Understood,” Agatha said, offering a faint smile. “Thank you, Jen. Really.”</p><p>Jen softened, reaching out to squeeze her arm. “Anytime. Just don’t make a habit of this, okay?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled dryly. “I’ll try. See you at the library”</p><p>After Jen left, the apartment was noticeably quieter. Rio lay back on her bed, her breathing steady but her exhaustion evident. Billy sat at the foot of the bed, his face still pale with worry.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio said softly, her gaze shifting to Agatha. “For...you know.”</p><p>“Don’t mention it,” Agatha replied, leaning against the doorframe. “Seriously. Don’t. You’ve caused enough drama for one day.”</p><p>Rio smirked weakly. “Wouldn’t want to ruin your reputation for keeping things boring.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t hide the small smile tugging at her lips. “Just get some rest, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her eyes already closing. Billy sat nearby, watching over her like a loyal little brother, while Agatha lingered in the doorway, silently promising herself to keep them both safe—no matter what.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>The apartment was finally quiet. Rio lay in her bed, her breathing steady and her face pale but peaceful. Agatha stood by the door, watching her for a few moments to ensure she was truly asleep. The room still smelled faintly of antiseptic, and a faint unease lingered in Agatha’s chest despite the calm.</p><p>She adjusted the blanket over Rio, tucking it gently around her before stepping out of the room and closing the door softly behind her.</p><p>In the living room, Wanda sat cross-legged on the couch, flipping absentmindedly through her phone while Billy lounged in an armchair, his gaze distant. The untouched pizza box sat on the coffee table, the aroma of cold cheese and sauce a stark reminder of the chaotic day they’d had.</p><p>Agatha walked over to the kitchen, opening a cabinet and pulling out two glasses. She poured whiskey into one and tequila into the other, bringing them back to the living room. She handed the tequila to Wanda and sat down in the armchair opposite her, swirling the whiskey in her glass.</p><p>Billy perked up, his eyes darting to the glasses. “Can I have some?”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow at him, her lips twitching into a faint smirk. “Of course not. You’re underage. You’re a teenager. So no drinking for you, Teen, or Rio will kill me the moment she gets better.”</p><p>Billy frowned, crossing his arms. “Teen? Really? That’s what you’re calling me now?”</p><p>“Seems fitting,” Agatha said, taking a sip of her whiskey. “Unless you’d prefer something more dramatic, like ‘Brooding Youth.’”</p><p>Wanda snorted into her tequila, shaking her head. “I like Teen. It suits him.”</p><p>Billy rolled his eyes but didn’t argue. “Fine. But it’s still unfair.”</p><p>“Life’s unfair,” Agatha said dryly, leaning back in her chair. “But I’ll make you a deal. No booze, but I’ll whip up some hot chocolate. Deal?”</p><p>Billy hesitated, then nodded reluctantly. “Deal. But it better be good.”</p><p>Agatha stood, smirking as she headed to the kitchen. “I don’t do mediocre, Teen.”</p><p>As Agatha prepared the hot chocolate, she could hear Wanda and Billy talking in the living room, their voices low and calm. When she returned with a steaming mug, she handed it to Billy, who accepted it with a quiet “Thanks.”</p><p>Agatha settled back into her chair, taking another sip of her whiskey. Wanda raised her glass in a mock toast. “To surviving the chaos.”</p><p>“Barely,” Agatha muttered, clinking her glass against Wanda’s.</p><p>Billy sipped his hot chocolate, watching them with a curious expression. “So...what’s the plan now?”</p><p>“The plan,” Agatha said, her tone firm, “is to keep a low profile and figure out what to do about those missing posters. We can’t risk anyone recognizing you, Teen.”</p><p>Billy frowned, glancing at the floor. “I didn’t mean to cause all this trouble.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened slightly. “You didn’t. But we’re in it now, so we’ll deal with it. Together.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her expression serious. “We’ll figure it out. And in the meantime, you’ve got us.”</p><p>Billy smiled faintly, the tension in his shoulders easing. “Thanks. Both of you.”</p><p>The three of them sat in silence for a while, sipping their respective drinks. The chaos of the day felt distant now, replaced by a tentative sense of peace. Agatha leaned back, her eyes drifting to the closed door of Rio’s room.</p><p>“She’s lucky to have you, you know, taking care of her and all.” Wanda said suddenly, her voice soft.</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched into a faint smile, but she didn’t reply. Instead, she raised her glass again, silently toasting to the complicated, messy connections that had become her life.</p><p>For now, they had survived. And that was enough. </p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, her whiskey glass resting on the armrest, as she turned her gaze to Teen.</p><p>“Alright, Teen,” Agatha said, her tone casual but laced with curiosity. “Start talking. What exactly happened today? How did Rio’s stitches break?”</p><p>Teen paused mid-sip of his hot chocolate, his shoulders stiffening. “Uh...it’s kind of a long story.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her gaze sharp. “I’ve got time. Start from the beginning.”</p><p>Teen sighed, setting his mug on the coffee table. “Okay, so it started when the pizza came...or at least, I thought it was the pizza.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, gesturing for him to continue. Wanda, now fully invested, set her tequila down and leaned forward.</p><p>“I texted Rio that I’d get the door,” Teen explained, fidgeting slightly. “But she texted me back, telling me not to open it. I didn’t see it until after I already opened the door.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed. “And?”</p><p>Teen hesitated, glancing at Wanda before continuing. “It wasn’t the pizza. It was...someone else.”</p><p>“Who?” Agatha asked, her voice sharper now.</p><p>Teen swallowed hard. “A woman. She looked...important. Older. Super intense. She asked who I was, and I asked who she was.”</p><p>Wanda frowned, sitting up straighter. “And?”</p><p>“She said her name was Evanora Harkness,” Teen said, his voice faltering slightly. “She said she’s your mum.”</p><p>Agatha and Wanda froze, their expressions shifting instantly. Agatha’s eyes widened in shock, her body stiffening as the words sank in. Wanda’s glass clinked against the table as she set it down, her face pale.</p><p>“WHAT?” Agatha shouted, her voice cutting through the room like a knife. “Did you just say my mum was here? Evanora Harkness? Today?”</p><p>Teen nodded quickly, shrinking slightly under her sharp gaze. “Yeah. She and Rio started yelling at each other. Like, really yelling.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me this earlier?” Agatha snapped, standing so abruptly that her whiskey nearly spilled. “Do you have any idea how bad this is?”</p><p>“Whoa, whoa,” Wanda said, standing as well, her tone trying to calm Agatha down. “Let’s not kill the kid. He didn’t know.”</p><p>“Didn’t know?” Agatha spat, pacing the room now, her hands running through her hair. “This is Evanora we’re talking about! My mum! The woman who made my life a living hell! She shows up out of nowhere, and you don’t think to tell me?”</p><p>Teen looked genuinely remorseful, his hands clenching his mug tightly. “I didn’t realize it was such a big deal. Rio was yelling at her, telling her to leave, she got so worked up, she even slammed into her desk trying to not get me to open the door and—well, you know the rest.”</p><p>Agatha stopped pacing, her hands on her hips as she turned to glare at him. “Of course it’s a big deal! My mother doesn’t just drop by for casual visits. She’s up to something.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her expression serious. “She wouldn’t have come here unless she had a reason.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Agatha said, pointing at Wanda before turning back to Teen. “What else did she say? Did she threaten anyone? Did she say anything about why she was here?”</p><p>Teen shook his head quickly. “No, she just kept asking about you. When Rio told her you weren’t home, she got really mad. Then she looked at me and said I looked familiar or something.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach sank, her hands curling into fists. “Of course she did.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda said, her voice cautious, “do you think she recognized him?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha muttered, her mind racing. “Or maybe she’s just sniffing around, trying to dig up dirt. Either way, this is not good.”</p><p>Agatha slumped back into her chair, grabbing her whiskey and downing the rest of it in one go. “Okay. We need to be smart about this. If Evanora’s involved, we’re officially in deep shit.”</p><p>“What do we do?” Teen asked, his voice small.</p><p>“We don’t panic,” Wanda said firmly, her gaze steady. “First, we figure out what she wants. Then, we decide how to deal with her.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, though her jaw was tight. “Agreed. But whatever happens, Teen, you do not open the door again. Not for anyone. Got it?”</p><p>Teen nodded quickly. “Got it.”</p><p>“And Rio?” Wanda asked, her tone softening. “What do we tell her?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing her temples. “We don’t tell her anything until she’s stronger. She’s been through enough.”</p><p>Wanda exchanged a look with Agatha, both of them understanding the gravity of the situation. For now, all they could do was wait—and hope Evanora didn’t strike again.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>The apartment was dimly lit, the quiet only broken by the faint sound of Billy’s soft snoring from the couch. Agatha moved silently through the hallway, pausing at Rio’s door. She peeked inside, her breath hitching slightly as she saw Rio still sleeping peacefully. The blanket was tucked snugly around her, and there were no signs of fresh blood on the bandages.</p><p>Agatha let out a small sigh of relief, closing the door gently before retreating to her room. She found Wanda already seated on the edge of her bed, the tequila and whiskey bottles resting on the nightstand.</p><p>“Is she okay?” Wanda asked softly, her gaze meeting Agatha’s as she entered.</p><p>“She’s fine,” Agatha replied, sitting down beside her. “Sleeping like a log.”</p><p>“Well, that’s one less thing to worry about tonight,” Wanda said, reaching for her glass of tequila and taking a small sip. “Now, what are we going to do about your mother?”</p><p>Agatha groaned, grabbing her own glass of whiskey and downing a larger gulp than necessary. She set the glass down heavily, her hands shaking slightly as she rubbed her temples.</p><p>“I don’t know, Wanda,” she admitted, her voice laced with frustration. “What do you even do when the Devil herself decides to drop by unannounced?”</p><p>“You know her better than anyone,” Wanda said, her tone even. “What do you think she’s after?”</p><p>Agatha let out a dry laugh, leaning back against the headboard. “Control. Chaos. Agatha-specific misery. Take your pick.”</p><p>Wanda frowned, setting her glass aside. “Do you think she’s here for you? Or for Billy?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha said, her voice rising slightly. “And that’s the worst part. She doesn’t just...show up, Wanda. She plans. She schemes. She’s always three steps ahead, and I’m always playing catch-up.”</p><p>Wanda reached out, placing a comforting hand on Agatha’s arm. “Hey, breathe. We’ll figure this out.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. She stared at her whiskey glass, her mind racing. “Maybe...maybe I should call her.”</p><p>Wanda’s brow furrowed. “What? Why?”</p><p>“To fish for information,” Agatha said, her voice more confident now. “If I can figure out what she wants, we can prepare. We won’t be caught off guard.”</p><p>Wanda hesitated, her lips pressing into a thin line. “Are you sure that’s a good idea? She’s a master manipulator, Agatha. She could twist the conversation to her advantage.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her expression grim. “I know. But sitting around and waiting for her next move isn’t exactly comforting, either. If I can get even the smallest hint of what she’s planning...it’s worth the risk.”</p><p>Wanda sighed, leaning back against the headboard. “Okay, but if you’re going to do this, you need to go in with a plan. Don’t let her control the conversation.”</p><p>Agatha smirked faintly, though her eyes were still filled with worry. “Who’s the lawyer here, Maximoff?”</p><p>“You might be the lawyer,” Wanda shot back, “but I’ve got years of practice dealing with chaotic energy. Trust me, you need backup on this one.”</p><p>They spent the next several minutes strategizing, Wanda helping Agatha map out possible approaches and responses. Agatha wrote down notes on a pad of paper, her handwriting growing messier as her nerves got the better of her.</p><p>“What if she asks about Billy?” Wanda asked, her voice cautious.</p><p>Agatha paused, tapping the pen against the pad. “I deflect. Say he’s just someone passing through. The less she knows, the better.”</p><p>“And Rio?” Wanda pressed.</p><p>“Off-limits,” Agatha said firmly. “She doesn’t get to know anything about her. Period.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, though her expression remained skeptical. “Just...be careful, Agatha. She’s your mother, but she’s also dangerous. Don’t let her get under your skin.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky laugh. “Easier said than done.”</p><p>As the clock ticked past midnight, Agatha leaned back, staring at the phone in her hand. Her thumb hovered over Evanora’s contact, her stomach twisting with anxiety.</p><p>“You don’t have to do this tonight,” Wanda said softly, watching her.</p><p>“Yes, I do,” Agatha replied, her voice steady despite the chaos in her mind. “The longer I wait, the more time she has to make her next move.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t argue, simply nodding as she refilled Agatha’s whiskey glass. “Then take a sip, breathe, and call her when you’re ready.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, gripping the phone tightly. Her mind raced with everything they’d discussed, every potential outcome, every worst-case scenario. But despite her fear, one thought stood out clearly: she needed to protect Rio and Billy. No matter what.</p><p>She wasn't sure if she was happy or terrified with the outcome of the call. Her mother didn't pick up. She would try again tomorrow. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The first light of dawn crept through the apartment windows as Agatha stirred from her restless sleep. Her mind, still hazy from the whiskey and the weight of last night’s conversations with Wanda, sharpened quickly as the realization of what she needed to do settled over her.</p><p>She sat up, running a hand through her disheveled hair and glancing at the clock. It was barely 6 a.m., but she knew there would be no more sleep for her—not until she had taken the next step.</p><p>With a sigh, she swung her legs over the side of the bed and stood, grabbing her phone from the nightstand. She stared at the screen, Evanora’s name glaring back at her from the contact list. Her stomach twisted, but she shoved the feeling down. Just do it, Harkness.</p><p>But first—coffee.</p><p>The kitchen was quiet as Agatha moved about, the familiar motions of brewing coffee grounding her. The soft gurgle of the machine and the warm scent of freshly brewed coffee filled the room, providing a small sense of normalcy in the midst of her anxiety.</p><p>As the coffee brewed, she pulled out eggs, toast, and bacon, deciding to distract herself with breakfast preparations. She cracked eggs into a bowl, whisking them briskly before pouring them into the hot skillet. The sizzle was oddly soothing.</p><p>Her phone sat on the counter, Evanora’s name still on the screen. Agatha glanced at it every few seconds, her nerves simmering just beneath the surface.</p><p>By the time breakfast was halfway done, Agatha couldn’t put it off any longer. She grabbed her phone, took a deep breath, and hit the call button.</p><p>The dial tone rang once. Twice. A third time.</p><p>“Agatha,” Evanora’s voice came through the line, smooth and sharp as always. “What an unexpected surprise.”</p><p>“Morning, Mother,” Agatha said, her voice steady despite the fluttering in her chest. “I figured it was time we talked.”</p><p>Evanora let out a soft laugh. “How thoughtful of you. And what, pray tell, has brought on this sudden desire for conversation?”</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth, forcing herself to keep her tone calm. “You showed up at my apartment yesterday. Care to explain?”</p><p>There was a pause, and then Evanora’s voice turned cold. “I don’t believe I owe you any explanations, Agatha. A mother is allowed to visit her daughter, isn’t she?”</p><p>“You didn’t visit me,” Agatha shot back. “You showed up unannounced, harassed my roommate, and made my guest uncomfortable. What are you really after?”</p><p>Evanora chuckled, the sound sending a chill down Agatha’s spine. “So defensive. I merely wanted to see how you’re doing. Is that such a crime?”</p><p>Agatha’s grip on the phone tightened. “Cut the crap, Mother. What do you want?”</p><p>Before Evanora could respond, the smell of the eggs threatened to burn. Agatha quickly moved the skillet off the heat, her phone pressed tightly to her ear as she juggled the conversation and breakfast.</p><p>“I’ll be seeing you soon, darling,” Evanora said cryptically, her tone sweet and venomous. “Take care.”</p><p>The line went dead before Agatha could reply. She stared at her phone, frustration bubbling up inside her. Of course, she’d leave it on a note like that.</p><p>Agatha placed the phone on the counter and exhaled sharply. She plated the eggs, bacon, and toast with a little more force than necessary, trying to channel her irritation into something productive.</p><p>Wanda appeared in the doorway, still in her pajamas, her scarlet hair messy from sleep. “You’re up early.”</p><p>Agatha gestured to the breakfast spread with a faint smile. “Thought I’d get a head start.”</p><p>“And?” Wanda asked, eyeing her carefully. “Did you call her?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her expression grim. “Yeah. It was...typical Evanora. No real answers, just cryptic nonsense and veiled threats.”</p><p>Wanda grabbed a plate and poured herself a cup of coffee. “What did she say?”</p><p>“She said she’ll be seeing me soon,” Agatha replied, her jaw tightening. “Which, coming from her, is about as comforting as a knife to the back.”</p><p>Wanda frowned, sitting down at the table. “What’s the plan now?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, pouring herself another cup of coffee. “We wait. And we prepare for whatever she’s got up her sleeve.”</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, nursing the last of her coffee as she and Wanda finished their breakfast. The conversation had been heavy, revolving around Evanora’s cryptic call and the potential fallout of her visit. The air was still tense, but they both knew they couldn’t dwell on it for long.</p><p>Agatha glanced at the clock on the wall and sighed. “It’s already nine. We need to get everyone up.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, pushing her plate away. “I’ll wake Billy.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “You sure you don’t want me to do it? He’s not exactly a morning person.”</p><p>Wanda smirked. “Neither am I. Besides, I think I can handle one sleepy teenager.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, standing to clear the plates. “Good luck, Maximoff.”</p><p>Wanda padded softly into the living room, where Billy was still sprawled out on the couch, tangled in the blanket Rio had given him the night before. His face was peaceful in sleep, a stark contrast to the usual sharp wit and sarcasm he wielded when awake.</p><p>She knelt down beside him, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder. “Billy,” she said softly, her tone warm and soothing. “Time to wake up, kiddo.”</p><p>Billy stirred slightly, his brow furrowing as he mumbled something incoherent. Wanda smiled faintly, giving his shoulder another gentle shake. “Come on, sleepyhead. It’s already nine.”</p><p>Billy’s lips moved, barely audible at first, before he mumbled, “Mum?”</p><p>Wanda froze, her breath catching in her throat. The single word, filled with so much longing and vulnerability, hit her like a punch to the chest. Her heart ached as she looked at the boy in front of her—a boy so desperate for affection and care that his first instinct in waking was to hope for his mother.</p><p>Billy’s eyes fluttered open slowly, blinking against the morning light. He looked at Wanda, confusion flickering across his face before recognition set in. “Oh...Wanda. Sorry, I thought—” He trailed off, sitting up and rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly.</p><p>Wanda forced a smile, though her heart still felt heavy. “No need to apologize,” she said gently. “You were dreaming, that’s all.”</p><p>Billy nodded, avoiding her gaze. “Yeah. Just a stupid dream.”</p><p>“It’s not stupid,” Wanda said softly, reaching out to brush a stray curl from his forehead. “And for what it’s worth, I think your mum would be proud of you.”</p><p>Billy glanced at her, his expression wavering between gratitude and uncertainty. “Thanks,” he said quietly, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Wanda stayed by his side for a moment longer, her hand resting lightly on his shoulder. She could see how much he craved a sense of belonging, how deeply the loss of his parents and the foster system’s failures had affected him. It made her heart ache, but it also steeled her resolve.</p><p>“You’re not alone, you know,” Wanda said, her voice steady but full of warmth. “You’ve got Rio. You’ve got Agatha. And you’ve got me.”</p><p>Billy gave her a small, tentative smile. “You’re not so bad, Maximoff.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled, ruffling his hair. “Come on. Let’s get moving. Agatha’s already plotting her next grand plan, and we don’t want to miss the show.”</p><p>Billy laughed softly, the sound lighter than Wanda expected. “Yeah, okay. I’m up.”</p><p>As Wanda and Billy walked back to the kitchen, she glanced at him out of the corner of her eye, the weight of his earlier words still lingering in her chest. She knew they couldn’t fix everything for him, but she silently vowed to be there for him as much as he needed.</p><p>Agatha looked up from the counter as they entered, her eyebrow arching. “You survived. I’m impressed.”</p><p>Wanda smirked, guiding Billy to the table. “Told you I could handle it.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Agatha said, pouring another cup of coffee. “Let’s see if you’re still that confident after dealing with Rio.”</p><p>Wanda laughed, though her thoughts remained with the fragile boy now sitting beside her, sipping on a glass of juice and finally beginning to open up to the makeshift family forming around him.</p><p>The door creaked softly as Agatha stepped into Rio’s room. The faint morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a gentle glow over the space. She expected to find Rio still peacefully asleep, recovering from the previous day. Instead, she froze in the doorway, her breath catching.</p><p>Rio was twisting and turning in her bed, her face contorted in pain and fear. She murmured incoherently, her words laced with panic. Sweat beaded on her forehead, and her movements grew more frantic as if she were trying to escape something.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha called softly, her voice filled with concern. She approached the bed, her worry intensifying as Rio’s quiet murmurs turned into cries.</p><p>
<em>In her dream, Rio was back in the dimly lit foster home, the stale smell of beer and cigarettes heavy in the air. She stood frozen on the stairs, her fragile, teenage frame trembling as she watched the scene below.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Billy, no older than five or six, shuffled nervously toward the foster father, clutching a small blanket. His tiny voice quivered as he spoke. “I-I had a bad dream. Can I stay here? Maybe...maybe have some milk?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>The man’s bloodshot eyes snapped toward the boy, his scowl deepening. “Milk? What do you think this is, a damn hotel? Get out of here!”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Billy flinched, his lip quivering as he tried to back away. The man surged to his feet, towering over the small child, his hand raised in anger.</em>
</p><p>
<em>From the stairs, Rio screamed, “Stop! Don’t you dare touch him!”</em>
</p><p>
<em>The man turned his glare on her, and Rio swallowed her fear, stepping down into the living room. Her voice trembled, but she forced herself to sound calm. “You don’t want to hit him. He’ll just cry, and that’ll be annoying. Hit me instead. I’ll be quiet.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Billy’s wide, terrified eyes darted to Rio. She crouched slightly, her voice a shaky whisper. “Billy, go. Go hide in our room and don’t come out until I come for you. Do you hear me?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Billy hesitated but obeyed, clutching his blanket tightly as he scrambled upstairs. Rio turned back to face the man, her heart pounding as his shadow loomed over her.</em>
</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha’s voice broke through the haze, desperate and urgent. She leaned over the bed, shaking Rio’s shoulders gently but firmly. “Wake up! It’s just a dream!”</p><p>Rio’s cries grew louder, her limbs kicking wildly as if she were fighting an invisible force. Tears streamed down her cheeks, and she screamed in her sleep, her body arching in fear and pain.</p><p>Agatha’s heart pounded as she tried to restrain her without hurting her. “Rio, please! You’re going to hurt yourself!” She carefully wrapped her arms around Rio, holding her tightly to prevent her stitches from reopening.</p><p>Rio’s struggles slowly began to subside, though her breathing was still ragged. Agatha whispered softly, her voice trembling. “It’s okay. You’re safe. It’s over.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped open, and she let out a scream of pain, her body jolting as reality crashed over her. Her gaze darted around the room before landing on Agatha, who held her tightly.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio whispered, her voice raw and filled with confusion.</p><p>“It’s me,” Agatha said gently, her arms still around her, planting a gentle kiss on her sweat filled forehead “You were dreaming. It’s okay. You’re safe now.”</p><p>Rio’s body shook as the tears came, wracking sobs escaping her lips. She buried her face in Agatha’s shoulder, clinging to her as if letting go would send her back into the nightmare.</p><p>Agatha’s own eyes glistened with unshed tears as she held Rio close, rubbing soothing circles on her back. “You’re okay, sweetie” she murmured. “I’ve got you. You’re okay.”</p><p>After several minutes, Rio’s sobs began to quiet, though her breathing was still uneven. She pulled back slightly, wiping her face with trembling hands. “I’m sorry,” she whispered. “I didn’t mean to...”</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha said firmly, her tone leaving no room for argument. “You don’t have to apologize for anything. Whatever you were dreaming about...it’s not your fault.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her eyes dropping to her lap. “It was about Billy,” she admitted softly. “About when I first met him.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart clenched, but she didn’t push. Instead, she reached for Rio’s hand, squeezing it gently. “You’ve been through a lot, haven’t you?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her lips trembling. “Yeah. But I had to be strong for him. Someone had to be.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed the lump in her throat, her respect and admiration for Rio deepening. “You’re stronger than you know,” she said softly. “But you don’t have to do it alone anymore, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded again, her grip on Agatha’s hand tightening. “Thanks, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly, brushing a stray tear from Rio’s cheek, leaning to give a peck on her lips. “Anytime.”</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Meanwhile in the other room</p><p>The kitchen was peaceful, the soft clinking of Wanda’s spoon against her coffee mug the only sound. Billy sat at the table, nursing a hot chocolate, his gaze distant but calm. Wanda studied him out of the corner of her eye, sensing that the events of the past few days weighed heavily on him.</p><p>“You doing okay, Billy?” she asked gently, her voice warm.</p><p>Billy shrugged, his hands wrapped around the mug. “Yeah, I guess. It’s just...a lot, you know?”</p><p>Wanda smiled softly, reaching across the table to tap his mug. “You’re handling it better than most would. Give yourself some credit.”</p><p>Billy managed a faint smile in return, but before either of them could say more, a muffled scream shattered the calm.</p><p>Wanda and Billy both froze, their eyes widening as the sounds of banging and yelling echoed through the apartment.</p><p>“Rio!” Billy exclaimed, leaping to his feet.</p><p>Wanda was right behind him as they rushed down the hallway, bursting into Rio’s room to find Agatha sitting on the edge of the bed, holding a trembling Rio in her arms. Rio’s cries were heart-wrenching, her body shaking with sobs as she clung to Agatha.</p><p>“What the hell did you do to her?” Billy demanded, his voice sharp and accusatory as he stepped forward. His hands curled into fists at his sides, his protective instincts flaring. “If you hurt her—”</p><p>“Billy, stop,” Wanda said softly, placing a hand on his shoulder, but he shrugged it off, glaring at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha looked up, her face a mixture of surprise and frustration. “I didn’t do anything,” she snapped, her voice low but firm. “She was having a nightmare. I was trying to help her.”</p><p>Billy’s glare faltered, uncertainty flickering across his face. “A nightmare?”</p><p>“Yes, a nightmare,” Agatha said, her tone softening slightly. “She was crying and kicking in her sleep. I was worried she’d hurt herself, so I woke her up. That’s all.”</p><p>Billy hesitated, his anger giving way to confusion and guilt as he looked at Rio. She was still sniffling in Agatha’s arms, her face buried in the crook of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“I...I’m sorry,” Billy said quietly, his voice shaky. “I just...I thought—”</p><p>Wanda stepped closer, her hand finding its way to the top of Billy’s back. She began tracing slow, soothing circles with her fingers, her touch light and reassuring. “It’s okay,” she said softly. “You were just trying to protect her. That’s not a bad thing.”</p><p>Billy’s shoulders relaxed under Wanda’s touch, his breathing evening out as he nodded. “I just didn’t know...”</p><p>Agatha sighed, her expression softening as she looked at him. “I get it, Teen. You care about her. So do I.”</p><p>Billy looked down at his feet, his voice barely above a whisper. “Sorry, Agatha.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha replied, her tone gentler now. “Rio’s lucky to have you watching out for her. But maybe next time, ask before you assume the worst?”</p><p>Billy nodded, his lips twitching into a faint, apologetic smile. “Yeah. I’ll do that.”</p><p>Rio stirred slightly, her sobs subsiding as she lifted her head to look around. Her eyes were red and puffy, and she sniffled as she took in the room. “What’s...what’s going on?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha said softly, brushing a strand of hair out of Rio’s face. “You had a bad dream. That’s all.”</p><p>Rio blinked, her gaze landing on Billy. “You okay?”</p><p>Billy laughed softly, though it sounded more like a nervous chuckle. “I should be asking you that.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, her hand reaching out toward him. “I’m fine. Thanks for worrying.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at Wanda, who gave her a small, knowing smile before stepping back, her hand still resting lightly on Billy’s shoulder.</p><p>The room fell into a tentative silence, the tension slowly dissipating. Agatha shifted slightly, adjusting Rio’s blanket before looking at Billy. “You’re a good kid, Teen. But you don’t need to fight every battle alone. We’re all on the same side here.”</p><p>Billy nodded, his expression thoughtful. “I know. It’s just...I’m not used to it, I guess.”</p><p>Wanda gave his shoulder a final reassuring squeeze before stepping back toward the door. “You’re getting there, Billy. One step at a time.”</p><p>Agatha glanced down at Rio, who had started to drift off again, her breathing steady. She looked back at Billy and Wanda, her voice soft but firm. “Let’s give her some space. She needs rest.”</p><p>Billy hesitated for a moment before nodding. “Okay.”</p><p>As they left the room, Wanda shot Agatha a reassuring look. “You handled that well.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing the back of her neck. “I’m just trying to keep us all from falling apart.”</p><p>“Seems like you’re doing a pretty good job,” Wanda said with a small smile.</p><p>Billy hesitated in the hallway, shuffling his feet awkwardly. “Uh, Agatha...is it okay if I take a shower? I feel kind of gross.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow but nodded. “Of course. Follow me.”</p><p>She led him to the bathroom, opening the cabinet to pull out a fresh towel. “Here,” she said, handing it to him. “Use whatever you need. Shampoo’s on the shelf, soap’s by the sink.”</p><p>Billy nodded, clutching the towel tightly. “Thanks.”</p><p>“One sec,” Agatha said, turning toward her room. She rummaged through a drawer, eventually pulling out a pair of sweatpants and a loose T-shirt that didn’t scream “girly.” Returning to Billy, she handed him the clothes. “They’re not exactly designer, but they’ll fit. Take as much time as you need.”</p><p>Billy managed a small smile. “Thanks, Agatha. Really.”</p><p>“Don’t mention it,” she said, waving him off as she headed back toward the kitchen.</p><p>When Agatha entered the kitchen, she found Wanda sitting at the table, her chin propped on her hand as she stared off into the distance. Her coffee sat untouched, the steam curling lazily into the air.</p><p>“Maximoff,” Agatha said, her voice cutting through the quiet. “Earth to Wanda. Are you going to help me finish this coffee, or should I just pour it out?”</p><p>Wanda blinked, snapping out of her thoughts. “Huh? Oh, sorry. I was just...thinking.”</p><p>“Dangerous,” Agatha teased, pouring herself a fresh cup. She leaned against the counter, studying her friend. “What’s got you so distracted?”</p><p>Wanda hesitated, her gaze dropping to the table. “Billy.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, setting her mug down. “What about him?”</p><p>Wanda looked up, her expression unusually serious. “Have you ever thought about having kids?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened, the question catching her completely off guard. “What? Wanda, we’re barely out of our twenties. We’re still kids ourselves.”</p><p>“I know,” Wanda said, her voice soft but insistent. “But after what happened earlier, it just...got me thinking.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, tilting her head. “What happened?”</p><p>Wanda leaned back in her chair, letting out a slow breath. “When I went to wake Billy up this morning, he thought I was his mum. He mumbled it in his sleep—‘Mum?’—like he was so desperate for it to be her.”</p><p>Agatha felt a pang of sadness in her chest but said nothing, letting Wanda continue.</p><p>“It broke my heart, Agatha,” Wanda admitted, her voice trembling slightly. “He’s so young, and he’s been through so much. All I could think was...what if someone just gave him a chance? A real home?”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, leaning against the counter. “Are you saying what I think you’re saying?”</p><p>Wanda met her gaze, her expression steady. “I’m saying I’m thinking about adopting him.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her friend, stunned. “Wanda, do you even hear yourself? Adopting a kid is a huge responsibility. You’d be signing up for an entirely different life.”</p><p>“I know,” Wanda said firmly. “But someone needs to step up. He doesn’t deserve to go back to the foster system.”</p><p>Agatha ran a hand through her hair, pacing the small kitchen. “Wanda, I get it. Believe me, I do. Billy’s a good kid, and he’s been dealt a terrible hand. But this is...big. You don’t just wake up one day and decide to adopt someone.”</p><p>Wanda sighed, her shoulders slumping slightly. “I’m not saying I’ve made up my mind. I’m just...thinking about it. About what it would mean for him. For me.”</p><p>Agatha stopped pacing, her gaze softening. “And what would it mean for you?”</p><p>Wanda hesitated, then smiled faintly. “It’d mean giving him a chance. Giving him a family. And maybe...maybe finding a part of myself I didn’t know I was missing.”</p><p>Agatha leaned against the counter, her arms crossed as she studied Wanda. “You’re serious about this.”</p><p>Wanda nodded. “I am.”</p><p>Agatha let out a long sigh, her mind racing. “You’re braver than I am, Maximoff. I’d be terrified.”</p><p>“You’re not as far off as you think,” Wanda said, her tone gentle. “You’ve been taking care of Rio, haven’t you? That’s not so different.”</p><p>Agatha smirked faintly. “Rio’s a little less fragile than Billy.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Wanda said. “But you’ve got a good heart, Agatha. Whether you realize it or not.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, her smirk turning into a soft laugh. “Well, don’t expect me to start shopping for adoption papers anytime soon. But...if you need support, you’ve got it. Always.”</p><p>Wanda smiled, reaching out to squeeze Agatha’s hand. “Thanks.”</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>As they sat in comfortable silence, Billy emerged from the hallway, his damp hair sticking up in every direction. The oversized clothes Agatha had given him made him look even younger, but his smile was relaxed.</p><p>“Thanks for the shower,” Billy said, rubbing the back of his neck. “And the clothes. I feel...better.”</p><p>Agatha raised her mug in mock toast. “Looking sharp, Teen.”</p><p>Billy grinned, grabbing a seat at the table. Wanda ruffled his hair playfully, her earlier thoughts still lingering in her mind.</p><p>For now, the apartment felt warm, safe—a fragile but welcome reprieve from the chaos that always seemed to find them.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha had gently insisted Rio sleep in her bed. “It’s bigger, and you need the space to heal,” she’d said matter-of-factly. What she hadn’t mentioned was how much she worried about another nightmare, wanting to be close enough to comfort Rio if it happened again.</p><p>Rio, too tired to argue, had agreed, and though she teased Agatha about her “hidden nurturing side,” she secretly appreciated the company. Their nights were quiet, marked by the occasional exchange of soft words before sleep claimed them.</p><p>Wanda had commandeered Rio’s room, setting up what she jokingly referred to as her “travel office.” Her laptop and notebooks were spread across the desk, turning the space into a blend of professional and mystical energy.</p><p>Meanwhile, Billy had made the living room couch his home base. His blankets and a small pile of books sat in one corner, while the coffee table served as his makeshift dining and workspace for studying. Wanda often joined him there, the two of them talking and laughing over shared meals or TV shows.</p><p>Their bond grew naturally, with Wanda’s nurturing side complementing Billy’s sharp wit. She was patient and kind with him, listening to his stories and offering thoughtful advice. Billy, in turn, seemed to soften around her, his walls coming down little by little.</p><p>Late one evening, after dinner, Agatha and Rio retreated to Agatha’s room. Rio leaned against the headboard, her arm propped up on a pillow, while Agatha sat cross-legged at the foot of the bed, sorting through some papers.</p><p>“Hey, Harkness,” Rio said casually, but her tone held a note of curiosity. “What’s up with Wanda and Billy?”</p><p>Agatha glanced up, raising an eyebrow. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“You know,” Rio said, waving a hand vaguely. “They’ve been spending a lot of time together. Talking, laughing, all that bonding stuff. It’s sweet, but...what’s going on?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, setting her papers aside. “They’re just getting along. Wanda’s good with people, and Teen...well, let’s just say he’s not used to people being good to him. She’s filling a gap he probably didn’t even realize he had.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, studying Agatha. “And you don’t think there’s more to it?”</p><p>“More, like what?” Agatha asked, her smirk turning into a soft laugh. “A love story? Hate to break it to you, but Wanda’s not really into teenagers. Heck she wasn't into them even when SHE was a teenager.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “No, not like that. I mean, Wanda’s acting all...mom-like. You think she’s thinking about taking him in? Because if not... let's just say it's cruel to have all this affection only to return to foster care"</p><p>Agatha paused, her amusement fading into thoughtfulness. “She might be. We talked about it the other day.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “Seriously?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha admitted. “She said she couldn’t stop thinking about how much he’s been through and how she could give him a chance at a real home.”</p><p>Rio leaned back against the headboard, her expression contemplative. “You think she’ll go through with it?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha said honestly. “It’s a big decision, and Wanda knows that. But if anyone could handle it, it’s her.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, a small smile tugging at her lips. “Well, if it happens, I think it’d be good for him. He deserves someone like her.”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly, leaning back on her hands. “Yeah, he does.”</p><p>For a moment, they sat in companionable silence, the bond between them growing stronger as they navigated the ever-shifting dynamics of their unconventional household.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>It had been almost a week since Billy joined their unconventional household, and life in the apartment had begun to settle into an odd rhythm. The lingering tension from Evanora’s visit and Rio’s injury was still there, but it had faded into the background as everyone adjusted to their new dynamic.</p><p>Rio was lounging on Agatha’s bed, her movements still careful to avoid straining her stitches. Agatha sat at the small desk nearby, scribbling notes on a legal pad, her focus seemingly elsewhere.</p><p>“Hey, Harkness,” Rio said, her tone casual but teasing. “Got a minute to spare for your favorite person?”</p><p>Agatha glanced up, raising an eyebrow. “Depends. What’s in it for me?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “The pleasure of my company, obviously.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, setting her pen down. “Alright, what’s on your mind?”</p><p>Rio shifted slightly, propping herself up on her elbows. “I was thinking...how about a second date?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, surprised but intrigued. “A second date? With you? Aren’t I lucky.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but grinned. “Yes, with me. But since I can’t exactly go waltzing around the city in this condition, I thought we could keep it simple. Stay in, order some food, watch a movie, maybe play a board game. What do you think?”</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, pretending to consider. “Hmm, a low-effort date with minimal travel? Sounds like my kind of night.”</p><p>Rio laughed, throwing a pillow in Agatha’s direction. “Low effort? Wow, you really know how to make a girl feel special.”</p><p>Agatha caught the pillow with a smirk. “Alright, alright. It sounds perfect. But what about Teen? We can’t exactly have a romantic evening with him lurking around.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “We could lock him in the bathroom?”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Tempting, but no. I’ll ask Wanda to take him out for a movie or something. He’ll be fine in the dark, and it’ll give him a chance to get out of the apartment.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her smile softening. “That’s a good idea. I think he could use a break.”</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Later that afternoon, Agatha found Wanda in her makeshift “office” in Rio’s room. She knocked on the doorframe, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation.</p><p>“Hey, Maximoff,” Agatha said. “Got a favor to ask.”</p><p>Wanda looked up from her laptop, raising an eyebrow. “Oh, this should be good.”</p><p>“Teen’s been cooped up here for days,” Agatha began, leaning against the wall. “I was thinking you could take him out tonight. Maybe a movie or something low-key.”</p><p>Wanda tilted her head, studying Agatha. “And this has nothing to do with the fact that you and Rio are planning a home date?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Pure coincidence.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled, closing her laptop. “Fine. But you owe me.”</p><p>“Add it to the tab,” Agatha replied, turning to leave. “Thanks, Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda found Billy in the living room, sprawled out on the couch with a book in his hands. She sat down beside him, nudging his shoulder playfully.</p><p>“Hey, kid,” she said. “Feel like going to a movie tonight?”</p><p>Billy glanced at her, his brow furrowing. “A movie? Why?”</p><p>“Because you’ve been stuck here for nearly a week,” Wanda said. “And I think you could use some fresh air.”</p><p>Billy hesitated. “What if someone recognizes me?”</p><p>“They won’t,” Wanda assured him. “It’s dark, it’s crowded, and I’ll be with you the whole time. Besides, I could use the company.”</p><p>Billy studied her for a moment before nodding. “Alright. A movie sounds cool.”</p><p>“Great,” Wanda said, standing. “Be ready by seven.”</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>As evening approached, the apartment buzzed with quiet anticipation. Wanda and Billy left just before seven, leaving Agatha and Rio alone. Agatha dimmed the lights in the living room and set up the coffee table with snacks and drinks.</p><p>Rio, dressed in comfortable loungewear, stretched out on the couch with a blanket draped over her legs. “I could get used to this,” she said, grinning as Agatha joined her.</p><p>Agatha handed her a takeout menu. “Pick whatever you want. Tonight’s all about you.”</p><p>Rio pretended to swoon. “Be still my heart.”</p><p>“Don’t push it,” Agatha said, smirking as she grabbed her phone to place the order.</p><p>When the food arrived, they spread it out on the coffee table and settled in for the evening. They started with a movie, their banter filling the gaps between scenes. Rio teased Agatha for her choice of snacks, while Agatha quipped about Rio’s “terrible” taste in movies.</p><p>Afterward, they pulled out a board game, the competition fierce but playful. Laughter echoed through the apartment, the weight of the past week momentarily forgotten.</p><p>By the end of the night, they were curled up together on the couch, the remnants of their dinner scattered around them. Agatha glanced at Rio, her expression softening. “Not bad for a second date.”</p><p>Rio smiled, leaning her head against Agatha’s shoulder. “Not bad at all.”</p><p>The night had been perfect—filled with laughter, playful competition, and the comfortable intimacy of being at home together. As the credits of their second movie rolled, Rio turned to Agatha, a mischievous grin spreading across her lips.</p><p>“So,” Rio began, her tone light but with a teasing edge, “does this fantastic second date earn me another makeout session?”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips twitching into a smirk. “Is that what this whole night was about? Buttering me up for more?”</p><p>Rio laughed, leaning closer. “Maybe. Is it working?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer with words. Instead, she closed the small gap between them, her lips finding Rio’s in a kiss that started soft but quickly deepened. Rio responded eagerly, her fingers threading into Agatha’s hair as she pulled her closer.</p><p>The kisses grew more fervent, the tension between them building as their bodies pressed together on the couch. Agatha’s hands roamed, one settling on Rio’s hip while the other cupped her breast through her shirt. Rio let out a soft gasp, arching into her touch.</p><p>“You’re so—” Rio started, her words lost in another kiss as Agatha’s lips trailed along her jawline and down her neck. Rio’s hand slid down to Agatha’s thigh, her fingers brushing lightly against the fabric.</p><p>Agatha’s own hand moved, slipping between Rio’s thighs, her touch teasing. Rio let out a soft moan, her breathing growing uneven as the intensity between them escalated.</p><p>Just as things started to spiral toward the point of no return, Agatha froze. Her mind snapped back to reality, and her gaze dropped to Rio’s side, where she knew the stitches lay hidden beneath the fabric.</p><p>“Wait,” Agatha said softly, pulling back slightly. Her hands stopped their exploration, though they lingered on Rio’s hips.</p><p>Rio blinked, her expression shifting from desire to confusion. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, her voice hesitant. “Your stitches. I don’t want to hurt you.”</p><p>Rio groaned, her head falling back against the couch in frustration. “Are you kidding me, Harkness? I’m fine.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, her tone firm despite the heat still coursing through her. “You might feel fine now, but if we keep going and something happens, I’ll never forgive myself.”</p><p>Rio sat up, running a hand through her hair as she exhaled sharply. “You’re such a rule-follower,” she muttered, though there was no real anger in her voice—just a deep, palpable frustration.</p><p>Agatha smirked faintly, trying to lighten the mood. “What can I say? I’m responsible.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, standing slowly and stretching carefully to avoid pulling at her stitches. “Well, for your information, I’m getting these stupid stitches removed in two days.”</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha asked, her smirk turning into a curious smile. “And what happens after that?”</p><p>Rio turned to her, a determined glint in her eyes. “After that, Harkness, I’m not holding back. No excuses, no hesitations. You’ve been warned.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, leaning back against the couch. “Consider me thoroughly warned.”</p><p>Despite the earlier heat and frustration, the evening ended on a softer note. Rio returned to her spot on the couch, curling up beside Agatha. They shared quiet conversation, their banter laced with teasing and affection, until the weight of the day finally pulled them toward sleep.</p><p>As Rio drifted off, her head resting on Agatha’s shoulder, Agatha stared at the ceiling, her mind a swirl of emotions. The spark between them was undeniable, and the thought of what lay ahead sent a thrill through her. But for now, she was content to wait—because with Rio, she knew it would be worth it.</p><p>The apartment door swung open, and the sound of Billy’s excited voice filled the space as he and Wanda returned from the movies. His energy was infectious, his words spilling out faster than anyone could follow.</p><p>“And the screen was huge! Like, I mean, bigger than this entire wall,” Billy exclaimed, gesturing wildly as he stepped into the living room. “And the sound—oh my God, it was like you could feel it in your chest! It was so cool!”</p><p>In the quiet of the room, the noise jolted both her and Rio awake. Agatha groaned softly, rubbing her eyes as she sat up. “What the hell is he on about now?”</p><p>Rio smirked, stretching carefully to avoid pulling at her stitches. “Sounds like Teen’s first trip to the movies was a hit.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled faintly. “Great. At least one of us is having an over-the-top experience tonight.”</p><p>Billy burst into the room a moment later, his eyes wide and sparkling with excitement. “Guys, it was amazing! Like, seriously, you don’t understand how awesome it was.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back against the couch, quirking an eyebrow. “Oh, I think we’re starting to understand.”</p><p>“And Wanda let me get everything at the concession stand,” Billy continued, his words tumbling over each other. “Popcorn, candy, chocolate, a drink—and look!” He dug into his jacket pocket and triumphantly pulled out a half-full bag of gummy bears. “I even saved some because, like, who knows when I’ll get to have them again?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, watching him with growing amusement. “You didn’t eat all of it? I’m impressed.”</p><p>Billy grinned, bouncing slightly on his feet. “Well, I wanted to, but Wanda said something about pacing myself. Not that it really mattered—this was the best night ever!”</p><p>Rio exchanged a glance with Agatha, both of them noticing the telltale signs of a sugar rush. Billy was practically vibrating with energy, his enthusiasm spilling out in every direction.</p><p>As Billy continued to excitedly recount the plot of the movie—complete with exaggerated hand gestures and dramatic sound effects—Rio’s attention shifted to Wanda, who leaned casually against the kitchen island, watching the boy with a soft smile.</p><p>Rio caught Wanda’s eye and mouthed a silent, heartfelt thank you, nodding slightly toward Billy. The gesture was subtle, but it spoke volumes: gratitude for the way Wanda had been taking care of him, for giving him moments of joy and normalcy he so clearly needed.</p><p>Wanda met Rio’s gaze, her expression warm as she gave a small nod in return. Her lips curved into a faint smile, acknowledging the unspoken bond that had formed between them over the past few days.</p><p>Rio turned her attention back to Billy, who was still animatedly describing the final action scene of the movie. She smirked, nudging Agatha lightly. “He’s on a sugar high now, but give it fifteen minutes, tops. He’s gonna crash.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly. “You think we should record his descent for posterity?”</p><p>Rio grinned, shaking her head. “Nah, let him have this. He deserves it.”</p><p>Billy paused mid-sentence, looking between them with suspicion. “What are you guys talking about?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio said innocently, leaning back against the pillows. “Keep going. I want to hear all about the big explosion.”</p><p>Billy launched back into his story, completely unaware of the fond smiles shared between Agatha, Rio, and Wanda.</p><p>As the evening wore on, Billy’s energy gradually began to wane, his words slowing as the sugar rush gave way to exhaustion. Wanda guided him toward the couch, helping him settle in with a blanket and a glass of water.</p><p>Agatha watched from the doorway, her arms crossed as she leaned against the frame. “You’ve got a knack for this, Maximoff.”</p><p>Wanda glanced over her shoulder, her smile soft. “For what?”</p><p>“Taking care of people,” Agatha said simply, her gaze shifting toward Billy, who was already half-asleep. “He’s lucky to have you.”</p><p>Wanda’s smile widened, but she didn’t reply. Instead, she turned back to Billy, smoothing the blanket over him as he murmured something incoherent.</p><p>Rio’s voice broke the silence, soft but teasing. “Careful, Wanda. If you keep this up, we might start calling you Mom.”</p><p>Wanda laughed quietly, shaking her head. “I think I’d prefer ‘Cool Aunt,’ thank you very much.”</p><p>The three women shared a quiet moment of camaraderie, the weight of the day lifting as they focused on the small, precious victories in front of them.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>The next couple of days had passed in an unsettling quiet. Life in the apartment had settled into a routine—meals, conversations, and small moments of calm—but the silence felt too perfect, too fragile, as though it were the calm before a storm.</p><p>Rio’s stitches had healed well, and the day had come for her to finally have them removed. Agatha and Rio had gone to the hospital together, leaving Wanda and Billy behind to hold down the fort. The plan was simple: stitches out, quick grocery run, and then back home.</p><p>“I’ll be right back,” Agatha had said, giving Rio a reassuring smile as they arrived at the hospital. “You handle the stitches, and I’ll grab us some groceries. Text me when you’re done.”</p><p>“Got it,” Rio replied, rolling her eyes playfully. “Try not to get lost in the produce aisle.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, ruffling Rio’s hair before heading off.</p><p>Rio sat patiently in the hospital room as the nurse worked efficiently to remove her stitches. The process was quick and painless, and within fifteen minutes, she was out of the room, feeling a newfound sense of freedom without the restriction of her healing wound.</p><p>She checked her phone, typing a quick message to Agatha:</p><p>
<em>All done. Waiting for you in the lobby.</em>
</p><p>Rio pocketed her phone and leaned against a pillar in the hospital’s entrance hall, watching the steady flow of people coming and going. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic, and the low hum of conversations filled the space. She exhaled, feeling lighter than she had in days.</p><p>A man in plain clothes stepped toward her, his expression calm but focused. He looked to be in his late thirties, with a neatly trimmed beard and sharp eyes that seemed to take in everything at once.</p><p>“Excuse me,” he said, his voice steady. “Are you Rio Vidal?”</p><p>Rio blinked, straightening slightly. “Uh, yeah. That’s me. What’s this about?”</p><p>The man reached into his pocket and pulled out a badge, his movements deliberate. “I’m Detective Morales with the local police department. I need to speak with you about a serious matter.”</p><p>Confusion flickered across Rio’s face. “Police? What’s going on?”</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” Morales said, his tone firm, “you’re under arrest for the kidnapping of William Kaplan.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught, her eyes widening in shock. “What? Kidnapping? No, there’s been a mistake! Billy’s staying with us, but he’s not—”</p><p>Morales interrupted her, his tone professional but unyielding. “You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you.”</p><p>Rio barely registered the rights as she struggled to process what was happening. “Wait, no—this isn’t—he’s not kidnapped! He came to us because he needed help!”</p><p>Ignoring her protests, Morales gently but firmly turned her around, cuffing her hands behind her back. The metal felt cold and unforgiving against her wrists.</p><p>“Please,” Rio said, her voice cracking. “You don’t understand. He’s like my little brother. I’d never hurt him.”</p><p>Morales’ expression softened slightly, but his grip on her arm remained firm. “You can explain that to your lawyer.”</p><p>As Rio was escorted toward the exit, her heart pounded. The lobby seemed to blur around her, faces turning to watch as she was led away.</p><p>Just as they reached the main entrance, Agatha appeared, a grocery bag in each hand. She froze mid-step, her eyes widening as she saw Rio in handcuffs.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha’s voice was sharp, laced with panic. She dropped the bags, rushing toward them. “What the hell is going on?”</p><p>Morales stepped in front of Agatha, holding up a hand. “Ma’am, please step back. This is a police matter.”</p><p>“She didn’t do anything!” Agatha snapped, her voice rising. “You can’t just arrest her without proof!”</p><p>“She’s been accused of kidnapping a minor, we have pictures of him entering an apartment at her name multiple times” Morales said calmly. “If you have any information, I suggest you speak with her attorney.”</p><p>Rio turned to Agatha, her eyes filled with fear and desperation. “Aggie, call Wanda. Tell her what’s happening.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her jaw tight as she pulled out her phone. “Don’t worry, Rio. We’ll fix this.”</p><p>As Rio was led out of the hospital, the weight of the situation sank in, leaving Agatha standing frozen in the lobby, her mind racing with how to help the person she cared about most.</p><p>Agatha stood frozen in the hospital lobby, her mind racing as she watched the police car pull away with Rio inside. The hum of activity around her seemed distant, muffled by the pounding of her heart.</p><p>She snapped out of it, fumbling with her phone as she dialed Wanda’s number. The phone rang once, twice, before Wanda’s familiar voice came through the line.</p><p>“Hey, Aggie, what’s—”</p><p>“Rio’s been arrested,” Agatha blurted, her voice trembling. “They’re accusing her of kidnapping Billy.”</p><p>“What?” Wanda’s voice shot up in alarm. “Are you serious? Where are you?”</p><p>“At the hospital,” Agatha said quickly. “They cuffed her right here and took her away. I—I don’t know what to do.”</p><p>Wanda’s tone steadied, though the urgency remained. “Okay, listen to me. Get back here. We’ll figure this out together. Just breathe, Aggie.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, even though Wanda couldn’t see her. “I’ll be home soon.”</p><p>When Agatha returned to the apartment, she found Wanda pacing in the living room, her phone in hand. Billy sat on the couch, his gaze darting nervously between them.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Billy asked, his voice small. “Where’s Rio?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her stomach knotting. She crouched down in front of Billy, meeting his wide-eyed gaze. “Billy, something happened. The police...they arrested Rio.”</p><p>Billy’s face paled, his mouth opening and closing as he struggled to process the words. “What? Why?”</p><p>“They think she kidnapped you,” Agatha said gently, her voice strained. “It’s not true, of course, but someone must have reported you missing and they have pictures of you in the building...”</p><p>Billy’s hands clenched into fists, his voice trembling. “I didn’t ask her to take me. I came to her because I had nowhere else to go!”</p><p>Agatha placed a hand on his shoulder, trying to calm him. “We know that. And we’re going to make sure they know it too.”</p><p>Wanda joined them, her expression tight but determined. “We need someone who can help—someone with real pull.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, already pulling up her contacts. “I know exactly who to call. Lilia Calderu.”</p><p>Billy frowned. “Who’s that?”</p><p>“She’s the best criminal law professor at the university,” Agatha explained. “She’s been mentoring me for a while now. If anyone can help Rio, it’s her.”</p><p>“Then call her,” Wanda urged. “The sooner, the better.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, taking a deep breath before dialing. The phone rang twice before a smooth, authoritative voice answered.</p><p>“Lilia Calderu.”</p><p>“Professor Calderu, it’s Agatha Harkness,” Agatha began, her voice trembling slightly. “I need your help.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Calderu said, her tone calm but curious. “What’s going on? You sound distressed.”</p><p>“One of my friends has been arrested,” Agatha explained quickly. “They’re accusing her of kidnapping, but it’s not true. It’s complicated, but she needs the best legal help, and I couldn’t think of anyone else to call.”</p><p>Calderu was silent for a moment, then her voice turned sharp and professional. “Tell me everything. Who is she? Where is she being held? And what evidence do you have?”</p><p>Agatha quickly recounted the situation—Billy’s arrival at their apartment, his history in the foster system, and the arrest at the hospital. Lilia listened intently, her questions precise and probing.</p><p>“This is serious,” Calderu said after a pause. “But if what you’ve told me is accurate, we can build a strong defense. I’ll take the case.”</p><p>Relief washed over Agatha. “Thank you, Professor. I’ll owe you forever for this.”</p><p>“You owe me nothing,” Calderu replied firmly. “Meet me at my office in an hour. Bring the boy. His testimony will be critical.”</p><p>After ending the call, Agatha turned back to the living room. Billy was staring at the floor, his hands gripping the edge of the couch.</p><p>“Billy,” Agatha said softly, sitting beside him. “We’re going to see someone who can help Rio. She’s the best lawyer I know, but she’ll need to hear your side of the story.”</p><p>Billy hesitated, his eyes filling with tears. “What if they don’t believe me? What if they think I’m lying?”</p><p>Agatha placed a hand on his, her voice steady. “That’s not going to happen. You just have to tell the truth. Professor Calderu will handle the rest.”</p><p>Wanda crouched beside them, her voice warm and encouraging. “You’ve got us, Billy. We’ll be right there with you.”</p><p>Billy sniffled, nodding slowly. “Okay. I’ll do it.”</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>An hour later, Agatha, Wanda, and Billy sat in Lilia Calderu’s elegant office. The room was lined with shelves of meticulously arranged legal books, and Lilia herself sat behind a polished desk, her sharp gaze fixed on them.</p><p>“Let’s get to work,” Lilia said, folding her hands on the desk. “Billy, I need you to tell me exactly what happened. Start from the beginning.”</p><p>Billy took a deep breath, his voice trembling slightly as he recounted everything—his life in the foster system, why he had gone to Rio, and how he had ended up staying with her.</p><p>Calderu nodded thoughtfully, making notes as he spoke. “Good. That aligns with what Agatha told me. Now, do you know who might have reported you missing?”</p><p>Billy frowned, his brow furrowing. “Maybe...the foster home? They don’t care about me, though. They just want to keep out of trouble.”</p><p>Agatha interjected. “It could also be Evanora Harkness. She was at our apartment a few days ago, and she saw Billy.”</p><p>Calderu’s eyes narrowed. “Evanora Harkness? She’s...persistent, to say the least. If she’s involved, this could complicate things.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “Then we deal with it.”</p><p>Calderu nodded, her expression firm. “I’ll work on getting Rio out on bail. Billy’s testimony will be crucial, but we’ll need to corroborate his story with any evidence—texts, photos, anything that shows Rio wasn’t hiding him.”</p><p>“I’ll get everything I can,” Agatha promised.</p><p>“Good,” Calderu said. “We’ll meet again tomorrow to prepare for the bail hearing. In the meantime, stay calm and don’t engage with anyone involved in the case.”</p>

<p>Back at the apartment, Agatha, Wanda, and Billy gathered around the coffee table, which was now covered in papers, Rio’s phone, and Billy’s belongings. Lilia Calderu had emphasized the importance of gathering any and all evidence to support their case, and they were determined to leave no stone unturned.</p><p>Agatha typed furiously on her laptop, pulling up timestamps from Rio’s text messages to corroborate Billy’s story. Wanda sifted through the scattered papers, organizing them into neat piles, while Billy sat cross-legged on the floor, nervously chewing on his thumbnail.</p><p>“Billy,” Wanda said gently, placing a hand on his shoulder. “Do you have anything else? Like a notebook or something with dates that might show how long you’ve been with Rio?”</p><p>Billy thought for a moment, then nodded. “Yeah, I’ve got this old planner Rio gave me when I got here. I was using it to keep track of stuff and homework.” He reached into his bag and pulled out a battered notebook, handing it to Wanda.</p><p>“This is good,” Wanda said, flipping through the pages. “It shows you’ve been staying here consistently since you arrived. That’ll help back up your timeline.”</p><p>Agatha glanced up, her expression sharp. “We also need to figure out who filed the report. Calderu said she’d look into it, but we should be ready for anything.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio sat in a small, cold cell at the police station, her mind racing. The arrest felt surreal, like a nightmare she couldn’t wake up from. She leaned back against the wall, staring at the faint cracks in the ceiling as her thoughts spiraled.</p><p>Billy’s going to think this is his fault. The idea made her stomach churn. She knew how much guilt the boy carried already, and this would only add to it.</p><p>The sound of footsteps interrupted her thoughts, and she looked up as an officer approached her cell. “You’ve got a visitor,” he said gruffly.</p><p>Rio’s heart leapt with hope, but it quickly sank when she realized it wasn’t Agatha or Wanda. Instead, a middle-aged man in a suit stepped forward—a public defender.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal,” the man said, his tone neutral but professional. “I’ve been assigned to your case.”</p><p>Rio frowned, shaking her head. “I already have someone helping me—a lawyer. I’m fine.”</p><p>The man looked surprised but nodded. “Alright. Just know I’m here if you change your mind.”</p><p>Rio watched him leave, her resolve strengthening. Agatha’s got this. I trust her.</p><p>The next day, Agatha and Billy sat in Lilia Calderu’s office, going over the plan for Rio’s bail hearing. Calderu had spent hours reviewing the evidence they’d gathered, and her confidence was palpable.</p><p>“Billy’s testimony will be key,” Calderu explained, looking directly at the boy. “You’ll need to be clear and concise. Just tell the truth—exactly what you told me.”</p><p>Billy nodded, though his hands fidgeted in his lap. “What if they don’t believe me?”</p><p>“They will,” Calderu said firmly. “You’re credible, and the timeline supports your story. But remember, the opposing side might try to twist your words. Stay calm, and don’t let them rattle you.”</p><p>Agatha leaned forward, her expression tense. “And what about Evanora? If she’s the one behind this, she won’t stop at just filing a report.”</p><p>Calderu’s eyes narrowed. “If she’s involved, we’ll deal with her. But for now, we focus on getting Rio out. Once she’s free, we’ll have more options.”</p><p>The courtroom was small and somber, the air thick with tension. Agatha sat beside Wanda and Billy, her heart pounding as she watched Rio being led in, her wrists bound with handcuffs. Rio glanced at them, her eyes softening slightly when they met Agatha’s.</p><p>Lilia Calderu stood confidently as the judge entered, her presence commanding respect. The prosecutor laid out the charges, but Calderu countered with sharp, well-prepared arguments, presenting the evidence they’d gathered to prove Rio’s innocence.</p><p>When the prosecutor called their key witness to the stand, the room fell silent. The sound of clicking heels echoed as a woman entered the courtroom, her presence immediately drawing attention.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted as recognition hit her like a punch to the gut. “No,” she whispered under her breath.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened as she followed Agatha’s gaze. There, standing with a calm, self-assured expression, was Evanora Harkness.</p><p>Evanora took the stand, her tone dripping with feigned concern as she described how she had visited the apartment and seen Billy there, allegedly “trapped” and “clearly terrified.” She painted a picture of Rio as a dangerous, manipulative figure who had taken advantage of the boy’s vulnerability.</p><p>“She was hiding him,” Evanora said, her voice steady and composed. “And when I tried to ask questions, she became hostile. I knew something had to be done to protect the child.”</p><p>Rio’s hands clenched into fists as she listened, her body trembling with anger. The audacity of Evanora’s lies made her blood boil. She could feel the weight of the cuffs against her wrists, grounding her only slightly as her emotions surged.</p><p>When the judge called a recess, Rio was escorted back toward the bench near her defense team. Evanora passed close by, her smug smile only fanning the flames of Rio’s rage.</p><p>“You,” Rio hissed, her voice low and dangerous. She lunged forward, her body moving instinctively, but before she could close the distance, Agatha was there, grabbing her arm.</p><p>“Rio, stop!” Agatha’s voice was firm, though her eyes were filled with worry.</p><p>Two officers stepped in, their hands hovering near their weapons. “Ma’am, step back,” one of them ordered.</p><p>“She’s lying!” Rio yelled, her voice cracking. “She doesn’t care about Billy—she’s doing this to mess with us!”</p><p>“Rio, please,” Wanda added, stepping forward and placing a calming hand on her shoulder. “You can’t let her get to you.”</p><p>Rio’s breathing was ragged as she locked eyes with Evanora, who remained composed, her expression unreadable. “She’s ruining everything,” Rio muttered, her shoulders slumping slightly as the fight drained out of her.</p><p>Agatha tightened her grip on Rio’s arm, pulling her back gently but firmly. “She wants you to lose it,” Agatha said quietly. “Don’t give her the satisfaction.”</p><p>When the hearing resumed, Calderu wasted no time dismantling Evanora’s claims. Her questions were precise, her tone sharp as she poked holes in the story. She highlighted inconsistencies and questioned Evanora’s motivations, casting doubt on her credibility.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness,” Calderu said, her voice calm but firm, “can you explain why you waited several days after allegedly witnessing this situation to report it? If you truly believed a child was in immediate danger, why delay?”</p><p>Evanora faltered slightly, her carefully constructed facade cracking under Calderu’s relentless scrutiny. “I—I wanted to gather more information,” she said, though her tone lacked its earlier confidence.</p><p>“Interesting,” Calderu replied smoothly, stepping back. “No further questions, Your Honor.”</p><p>Billy’s testimony followed, his heartfelt and honest account tipping the scales in Rio’s favor. By the end of the hearing, Calderu’s case was airtight. The judge ruled in Rio’s favor, granting her bail with strict conditions.</p><p>When the gavel fell, Agatha felt a wave of relief wash over her. Rio was coming home.</p><p>As they exited the courthouse, Rio was finally free to walk beside them, though her steps were slow and cautious. Agatha reached out, taking her hand gently. “You okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded, though her voice was soft. “Yeah. Thanks to you.”</p><p>“It wasn’t just me,” Agatha said, glancing at Billy and Wanda. “We all had your back.”</p><p>Billy rushed forward, wrapping Rio in a tight hug. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “This is all my fault.”</p><p>Rio knelt slightly, looking him in the eyes. “Hey, none of this is your fault. Got it? I’d do it all over again if it meant keeping you safe.”</p><p>Wanda smiled, her gaze flicking to Agatha. “Looks like the team’s back together.”</p><p>“For now,” Calderu interjected, her expression serious. “This isn’t over yet. The charges haven’t been dropped. We need to prepare for what’s coming.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her jaw tightening. “Then we fight.”</p><p>As the courtroom emptied and the tension began to dissipate, Lilia Calderu approached Rio, her sharp eyes studying her intently.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal,” Calderu said, her tone calm but firm, “may I have a word with you? Privately.”</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha, who hesitated but nodded. “I’ll wait outside,” Agatha said, her voice soft with lingering worry.</p><p>Rio followed Calderu to a quiet corner of the courthouse, her hands stuffed in her pockets. “What’s up?”</p><p>Calderu crossed her arms, her expression unreadable. “You’ve been granted bail, which is a relief, but you need to understand that this is far from over. The accusations, even if proven false, will leave a mark on your record.”</p><p>Rio frowned, the words sinking in like lead. “What do you mean? This goes away if I’m cleared, right?”</p><p>“Not entirely,” Calderu admitted, her voice low. “The court documents, the arrest—it all leaves a paper trail. And sooner or later, someone at the university might take notice. They could use this as a reason to go after your scholarship.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach twisted. The scholarship wasn’t just a financial aid—it was her lifeline, her chance to build a better future. “So, what do I do?”</p><p>“When that happens—and it’s a matter of when, not if—you come to me,” Calderu said, her voice steady. “I’ll help you navigate it, but it has to be discreet. Officially, I can’t intervene directly. My position at the university prohibits it.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed. “Then how can you help?”</p><p>Calderu’s gaze shifted briefly toward the courtroom doors, where Agatha was waiting. A faint smile tugged at her lips. “You have someone who’s already invested in your well-being. Someone who will fight for you. Agatha can act in ways I cannot. If the university challenges your standing, she can represent you—through me.”</p><p>Rio blinked, processing the weight of Calderu’s words. “So, you’re saying Agatha would be my lawyer, but you’d guide her behind the scenes?”</p><p>“Exactly,” Calderu said, her expression softening slightly. “Agatha is sharp and determined, and I’ve been mentoring her for years. Together, we can make sure you don’t lose everything you’ve worked for.”</p><p>Rio let out a shaky breath, her gratitude mingling with anxiety. “Thank you, Professor. Really.”</p><p>Calderu nodded, placing a hand on Rio’s shoulder. “Keep your head down for now. Stay focused. And remember—you’re not alone in this.”</p><p>When Rio stepped back into the hallway, Agatha was leaning against the wall, arms crossed, her gaze flicking between Wanda and Billy as they talked quietly. She straightened immediately when she saw Rio.</p><p>“What was that about?” Agatha asked, her tone curious but gentle.</p><p>Rio offered a small smile, her eyes meeting Agatha’s. “Just...getting some advice. She said I’ve got good people in my corner.”</p><p>Agatha smirked faintly. “She’s not wrong.”</p><p>As the group exited the courthouse together, Rio glanced back once, seeing Calderu standing near the doorway, her sharp eyes watching over them like a quiet guardian. Rio silently vowed to fight for everything she had—and to lean on those who had her back when she needed it most.</p><p>As the group lingered outside the courthouse, Rio and Agatha deep in conversation with Billy, Wanda found her gaze drifting toward Lilia once again. The professor stood near the steps, her commanding presence as steady as ever, despite the whirlwind of emotions that had overtaken the day.</p><p>Wanda hesitated, her fingers curling and uncurling at her sides as she debated whether to approach. Finally, with a deep breath, she crossed the space between them.</p><p>“Professor Calderu?” Wanda said softly, her tone unusually unsure.</p><p>Lilia turned, her sharp gaze softening slightly. “Wanda Maximoff, isn’t it?”</p><p>Wanda blinked, surprised. “You...know who I am?”</p><p>“Agatha’s spoken about you,” Lilia said with a faint smile. “How can I help?”</p><p>Wanda hesitated for a moment, then pressed on. “Is there any way we can request temporary guardianship for Billy? Just until all of this is sorted out? He can’t go back to the system—not after everything he’s been through.”</p><p>Lilia’s expression softened slightly, though her professional demeanor remained intact. “That’s already part of my plan,” she said, her tone reassuring. “Temporary guardianship is the first step in cases like this. I’ve already submitted the necessary preliminary paperwork.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes widened, a flicker of relief passing over her face. “You have?”</p><p>Lilia nodded. “Billy’s well-being is a priority, and the courts will take that into account. As long as the living environment is deemed safe, temporary guardianship should be granted without much resistance.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Wanda said, her voice filled with genuine gratitude. “That means a lot.”</p><p>Lilia’s lips curved into a faint smile. “I take care of my clients, Maximoff. And Agatha seems to have you as family so it's more personal than that. But this is just the beginning. There’s still a long road ahead.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her resolve strengthening. “I’ll do whatever it takes.”</p><p>Wanda hesitated again, then plunged ahead. “I, uh...I wanted to ask about adoption too. How it works. The process.”</p><p>Lilia’s expression shifted to one of curiosity, her head tilting slightly. “Adoption isn’t quite my area of expertise. May I ask who this concerns?”</p><p>Wanda glanced back toward the group, her eyes landing on Billy, who was animatedly talking to Rio. Her voice softened as she said, “It’s about Billy. He’s been through so much, and...I’ve been thinking about giving him a real home. A family.”</p><p>Lilia’s sharp eyes studied Wanda for a long moment, as if weighing her sincerity. Finally, her expression softened, and she nodded. “That’s a noble decision, Wanda. Not an easy one, but noble.”</p><p>“I just want him to feel safe,” Wanda admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “To know that someone’s there for him, no matter what.”</p><p>Lilia reached into her pocket, pulling out a small notepad and pen. She scribbled something down and tore off the page, handing it to Wanda. “This is the contact information for a legal advisory company called The Road. They specialize in adoption and family law.”</p><p>Wanda took the paper carefully, her fingers brushing over the neatly written name and number. “Thank you.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice turned slightly warmer, though it retained its professionalism. “When you contact them, tell them Lilia sent you. They’ll take good care of you.”</p><p>Wanda looked up, her eyes glistening slightly. “Why are you being so kind?”</p><p>Lilia’s gaze softened, and for a moment, her composed exterior seemed to falter. “Because I’ve seen too many children lost in a system that fails them. And because you remind me of someone who once gave me hope when I needed it most.”</p><p>Wanda swallowed hard, the weight of the words settling over her. “I’ll make sure he’s okay. I promise.”</p><p>“I know you will,” Lilia said simply, her lips curving into a faint smile. “It’s clear you care deeply. That’s a good start.”</p><p>As Wanda returned to the group, she clutched the paper tightly in her hand, a renewed sense of purpose filling her chest. She caught Agatha’s questioning glance and gave a small nod of reassurance, tucking the paper into her pocket.</p><p>“Everything okay?” Agatha asked quietly.</p><p>“Yeah,” Wanda said, her voice steadier now. “Better than okay.”</p><p>As Billy caught her gaze and offered her a shy smile, Wanda silently vowed to do whatever it took to give him the life he deserved. A life filled with safety, love, and the family he had been missing for so long.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The apartment was unusually quiet when the group returned. The weight of the day had left everyone drained, and even Billy’s usual chatter had dwindled to a soft murmur. Wanda opened the door, ushering Billy inside while Agatha and Rio followed closely behind.</p><p>As soon as they entered, Billy dropped his bag by the couch and flopped down, sighing heavily. “It feels good to be back.”</p><p>Rio, still weary from the ordeal, gave a faint smile. “I second that.”</p><p>Agatha set her keys on the counter, watching Rio carefully. “You need to rest.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Yes, Mom.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, her lips twitching into a smirk. “Don’t push it, Vidal.”</p><p>While Rio settled into her usual spot on the couch, Wanda headed to the kitchen to make tea. Agatha followed, leaning against the counter as Wanda boiled water.</p><p>“How are you holding up?” Wanda asked without turning around.</p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing the back of her neck. “I’m not sure. One minute, I’m relieved Rio’s out, and the next, I’m panicking about what comes next.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, pouring water into two mugs. “It’s a lot. But Calderu’s good, Aggie. She’ll guide us through this.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, her shoulders relaxing slightly. “I know. I just hate feeling powerless.”</p><p>“You’re not powerless,” Wanda said, handing her a mug. “You’re doing everything you can. And you’re not alone in this.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a small, grateful smile. “Thanks, Maximoff.”</p><p>The group gathered in the living room, their usual banter muted by the day’s events. Wanda sat cross-legged on the floor, flipping through a magazine, while Billy sprawled out with a book. Rio leaned back against the armrest of the couch, her eyes half-closed, and Agatha sat beside her, pretending to read but clearly lost in thought.</p><p>Billy broke the silence. “So, what happens now?”</p><p>Agatha glanced at him, her expression softening. “Now, we wait. Calderu’s working on the case, and we’ll do everything we can to prepare.”</p><p>Billy nodded, his gaze dropping to the book in his lap. “I just...I don’t want Rio to get in trouble because of me.”</p><p>Rio opened her eyes, her voice firm but kind. “Hey. None of this is your fault, Teen. You don’t control what other people do. You just focus on being you, okay?”</p><p>Billy nodded again, his expression wavering between relief and guilt.</p><p>As the evening wore on, Wanda found herself watching Billy more closely. The boy’s shoulders were tense, and though he tried to hide it, the day’s events had clearly shaken him. She thought about the paper in her pocket—the number Lilia had given her—and felt a renewed sense of purpose.</p><p>After everyone else had settled into their evening routines, Wanda pulled Agatha aside.</p><p>“I’ve made a decision,” Wanda said quietly, her tone resolute.</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “About what?”</p><p>“Billy,” Wanda said. “I’m going to start the adoption process.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, taken aback. “Are you sure? That’s...huge.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her gaze steady. “He needs someone, Aggie. Someone who’s there for him, no matter what. And I think I can be that person.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment before nodding. “If anyone can do it, it’s you.”</p><p>As the night deepened, the group began to drift off to bed. Billy was the first, retreating to the couch with his blankets. Wanda followed shortly after, giving Agatha a reassuring pat on the shoulder as she passed.</p><p>Rio and Agatha lingered in the living room, the quiet settling around them like a blanket. Rio glanced at Agatha, her voice soft. “Hey. Thanks for today. For everything.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, though her expression was warm. “It’s what I do.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, her eyes heavy with sleep. “You’re pretty good at it.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, standing and offering Rio a hand. “Come on. Let’s get you to bed.”</p><p>As they walked down the hall, Agatha felt a flicker of hope amidst the chaos. They had a long road ahead, but together, they could face whatever came next.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The apartment was quiet save for the soft hum of the refrigerator and the occasional creak of the building settling. Wanda sat on the edge of the couch, her hands clasped tightly in her lap, her thumb absently running over the edge of the paper Lilia had given her. Across from her, Billy was sprawled out, a half-finished book resting on his chest as he stared at the ceiling.</p><p>“You’re being weird,” Billy said suddenly, his voice cutting through the stillness.</p><p>Wanda blinked, startled. “What?”</p><p>Billy sat up, frowning at her. “You’re acting weird. Like...nervous or something. Did I do something wrong?”</p><p>Wanda’s heart sank at the look on his face—the fear and guilt flickering in his eyes. “No, Billy,” she said quickly, her voice gentle. “You didn’t do anything wrong. I promise.”</p><p>“Then what’s going on?” he asked, his voice wavering slightly. “You’ve been quiet ever since we got back. Are you scared? Do you think you’ll get in trouble too?”</p><p>“No,” Wanda said firmly, scooting closer to him. “That’s not it at all.”</p><p>Billy looked at her, his expression skeptical but hopeful. “Then what is it?”</p><p>Wanda hesitated, her gaze dropping to her hands. She took a deep breath, gathering her thoughts. “I’ve been thinking about you,” she said finally, her voice soft. “About everything you’ve been through. And about what I can do to help.”</p><p>Billy frowned, tilting his head. “Help how?”</p><p>Wanda looked up, her eyes meeting his. “Billy, I want to adopt you.”</p><p>The words hung in the air, heavy with meaning. Billy stared at her, his mouth opening and closing as if he were trying to form a response but couldn’t find the words.</p><p>“You want to...adopt me?” he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>“Yes,” Wanda said, her voice trembling slightly. “I want to give you a real home. A place where you feel safe. Where you don’t have to worry about being sent away or whether someone cares about you.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes filled with tears, his hands gripping the edge of the couch. “But...why? I’m just...me. I’m nothing special. And I'm way too old for a family to want me.”</p><p>Wanda reached out, placing her hands over his. “You’re wrong, Billy. You are special. And you deserve a chance at a better life.”</p><p>Billy sniffled, his voice trembling. “You don’t even know me that well. How can you be so sure?”</p><p>Wanda’s gaze softened, and she gave his hands a gentle squeeze. “Because I know what it’s like to feel alone. To lose everything.”</p><p>Billy blinked, startled by the sudden vulnerability in her voice. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Wanda looked away for a moment, her eyes distant as she began to speak. “When I was seventeen, my parents and my brother Pietro died in a car crash. One minute, we were a family, and the next...they were gone.”</p><p>Billy’s breath hitched, his hands tightening under hers. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Wanda smiled faintly, though her eyes glistened with unshed tears. “Thank you. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever been through. For a long time, I felt like I didn’t have a purpose. Like I didn’t belong anywhere.”</p><p>She paused, taking a shaky breath. “But I had people who cared about me. People who helped me find my way. And I want to be that person for you, Billy. I want to make sure you never feel alone like I did.”</p><p>Billy wiped his eyes on his sleeve, his voice breaking as he spoke. “No one’s ever said that to me before. No one’s ever...wanted me.”</p><p>Wanda’s heart ached at the words, and she pulled him into a gentle hug. “Well, I do,” she said softly. “I want you, Billy. You’re not just some kid passing through my life. You matter.”</p><p>Billy clung to her, his body trembling with quiet sobs. “But what if I mess it up? What if I’m too much?”</p><p>“You’re not too much,” Wanda said firmly, pulling back to look him in the eyes. “And even if you make mistakes, it doesn’t mean I’ll stop caring about you. That’s what family is, Billy. It’s not about being perfect—it’s about being there for each other.”</p><p>Billy nodded, his tears slowing as he took in her words. “You really mean it?”</p><p>Wanda smiled, brushing a tear from his cheek. “I really mean it.”</p><p>They sat in silence for a moment, the weight of the conversation settling over them. Finally, Billy spoke, his voice hesitant but hopeful. “So...what happens now?”</p><p>Wanda chuckled softly, reaching into her pocket and pulling out the paper Lilia had given her. “Now, I call this number. There’s a lot of paperwork and legal stuff to figure out, but we’ll get through it.”</p><p>Billy nodded, a small smile tugging at his lips. “Okay.”</p><p>Wanda ruffled his hair playfully. “You better get used to me, Teen. You’re stuck with me now.”</p><p>Billy laughed, the sound light and genuine. “I think I can handle that.”</p><p>He hesitated, looking down at his hands before glancing back up at her. “So...if this happens, do you want me to call you Mum? Or...what?”</p><p>The question caught Wanda off guard, her breath hitching as her chest tightened. She looked at Billy, his wide, earnest eyes searching hers for an answer, and felt a wave of emotion crash over her.</p><p>“You can call me whatever you want,” Wanda said softly, her voice trembling. “If you’re comfortable with Mum, I’d be honored. But it’s your choice, Billy.”</p><p>Billy swallowed hard, his eyes glistening with tears. “I’ve never called anyone that before. Not since...you know.”</p><p>Wanda placed a gentle hand on his cheek, her thumb brushing away a stray tear. “It doesn’t have to happen right away. Or ever, if you don’t want it to. I'm good with cool aunt Wanda. This is about you feeling safe and loved. That’s what matters to me.”</p><p>Billy leaned into her touch, his voice breaking as he whispered, “I think I’d like that. Maybe not all the time, but...sometimes.”</p><p>Wanda smiled, her own tears threatening to spill. “Then Mum it is. Whenever you’re ready.”</p><p>Billy sniffled, wiping his nose on his sleeve before chuckling softly. “You know, you’re way cooler than I thought a mum would be.”</p><p>Wanda laughed, ruffling his hair playfully. “Don’t push your luck, Teen. I still have the authority to ground you.”</p><p>Billy grinned, the lightness in his expression a welcome relief. “Okay, Mum.” he replied teasingly. </p><p>The word felt foreign on his tongue, but it also felt right. Wanda’s heart swelled, and she pulled him into a hug, holding him tightly as if to shield him from all the hurt he’d endured.</p><p>As they sat there, the world outside their small bubble faded away. For the first time in a long while, Billy felt like he had a home—and Wanda felt like she had a purpose.</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio and Agatha made their way to Agatha’s room, the weight of the day still lingering but softened by the comfort of being home together. Agatha shut the door behind them, leaning against it for a moment before glancing at Rio, who was already pulling her hair into a loose bun.</p><p>Rio stretched, wincing slightly as her muscles protested. “I feel gross. I think I need a shower.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, crossing her arms. “Considering you were at the courthouse all day, I’d say that’s an excellent idea.”</p><p>Rio grinned, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “Want to join me?”</p><p>Agatha froze, caught off guard by the playful yet inviting tone in Rio’s voice. Her gaze flicked to Rio, who was leaning casually against the bedpost, her expression daring but affectionate.</p><p>“I—uh...” Agatha stammered, her cheeks flushing slightly as she straightened. “Are you even cleared for, you know, ‘extracurricular activities’? You did just get your stitches out.”</p><p>Rio laughed, a low and melodic sound that sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine. “Relax, Harkness. I’m not asking you to wrestle me. Just a shower. Innocent, warm, and steamy.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow, her lips quirking into a smirk. “You’re terrible, you know that?”</p><p>Rio stepped closer, her voice dropping slightly. “Terrible enough to tempt you?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, though her smile betrayed her amusement. “Fine. But if you pass out from exhaustion or pull something, I’m leaving you to explain it to Wanda.”</p><p>The bathroom filled with steam as the hot water cascaded over the glass walls of the shower. Agatha and Rio stepped inside, the warmth enveloping them as the day’s tension melted away.</p><p>For a moment, they simply stood there, letting the water wash over them. Rio closed her eyes, tilting her head back as she let out a contented sigh. “This is heaven.”</p><p>Agatha reached for the shampoo, her movements efficient but gentle. “Turn around,” she instructed, her voice soft but firm.</p><p>Rio obeyed, and Agatha lathered the shampoo into her hair, her fingers massaging Rio’s scalp with practiced care. “You’ve got soap in your ears,” Agatha teased.</p><p>“Worth it,” Rio replied, her voice lazy with relaxation.</p><p>As the shower progressed, their touches grew softer, more intimate—not rushed or frantic, but deliberate and tender. Agatha rinsed the soap from Rio’s hair, her fingers lingering as they slid through the dark strands.</p><p>“Better?” Agatha asked, her voice quieter now.</p><p>“Much,” Rio murmured, her eyes fluttering open to meet Agatha’s. “You’re good at this.”</p><p>“I’m good at a lot of things,” Agatha replied, her smirk returning.</p><p>As the water began to cool, Rio turned to face Agatha fully, her hands resting lightly on Agatha’s hips. Her expression softened, the teasing edge giving way to something more serious.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Thanks for everything today. I know it wasn’t easy.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened, her hand brushing a damp strand of hair from Rio’s face. “I’d do it again in a heartbeat.”</p><p>Rio leaned in, resting her forehead against Agatha’s. “You really are something else, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, her arms wrapping around Rio’s waist. “Don’t get used to it. I’ve got a reputation to maintain.”</p><p>Rio laughed, the sound warm and genuine, as she pulled Agatha closer. “Noted. But for now, I’m keeping you to myself.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, pressing a gentle kiss to Rio’s temple. “Fair enough.”</p>

<p>The warm steam filled the bathroom as Agatha and Rio stepped out of the shower, their bodies still glistening with droplets of water. It had been a much-needed moment of relaxation for both of them, especially Rio, who had endured a terrifying experience. Agatha, grateful and protective, had agreed on showering together, washing away the remnants of fear and tension from Rio's body.</p><p>Wrapped in soft towels, they made their way to the bed, the cool air sending shivers down their spines. Rio's eyes sparkled with a mixture of relief and desire as she glanced at Agatha, her dark hair falling gracefully across her shoulders. They had been through so much together, and tonight was about celebrating their bond and Rio's recovery.</p><p>Agatha, her icy blue eyes soft and loving, helped Rio into her favorite pajamas, the fabric sliding smoothly over her delicate skin. Rio's body was a canvas of beauty, with a few faint scars here and there, reminders of her bravery. As they settled into the cozy bed, the moonlight filtering through the window illuminated their forms, creating an intimate atmosphere.</p><p><em>"You're an angel, you know that?"</em> Rio whispered; her voice hoarse with emotion. She reached up and caressed Agatha's cheek, her touch gentle and filled with adoration. <em>"I don't know what I would've done if it weren’t for you."</em></p><p>Agatha's heart swelled with love as she leaned in, capturing Rio's lips in a tender kiss. It was a kiss filled with unspoken words, a promise of comfort and pleasure. Their lips moved in perfect harmony, exploring each other with a slow, deliberate pace. Rio's hands traveled up Agatha's pajama top, her fingers gently tracing the curves of her waist.</p><p><em>"I'm just glad you're safe,"</em> Agatha murmured against Rio's lips, her breath warm and inviting. <em>"I want to make you feel loved, to take away the pain."</em></p><p>Rio's eyes darkened with desire, and she pulled Agatha closer, their bodies aligning perfectly. <em>"You already do, Agatha. Tonight, I need you."</em></p><p>As if understanding the unspoken request, Agatha began to slowly undress Rio, her fingers deftly unbuttoning the pajama top. Rio arched her back slightly, allowing the fabric to slide off her shoulders, revealing her firm breasts and erect nipples. Agatha's breath caught at the sight, her own desire rising to meet Rio's.</p><p>With gentle hands, she cupped Rio's breasts, her thumbs brushing over the sensitive peaks, eliciting a soft moan from Rio's lips. <em>"You're so beautiful,"</em> Agatha whispered, her voice thick with want. <em>"Let me show you how much I appreciate you."</em></p><p>Rio's hands found their way into Agatha's hair, gently tugging her closer for another kiss. Their tongues danced in a sensual rhythm, exploring each other's mouths with growing urgency. Rio's hands traveled down Agatha's body, slipping under her pajama bottoms, and caressing the curve of her ass.</p><p>Agatha let out a soft gasp as Rio's fingers trailed lower, slipping between her thighs and finding the damp heat of her arousal. <em>"Oh, Rio,"</em> she breathed, her hips instinctively moving against Rio's hand. <em>"I want you, but I'm scared I might hurt you."</em></p><p>Rio smiled; her eyes filled with determination. <em>"I'm stronger than you think. I need to feel you, all of you, please.”</em></p><p>With that, Rio guided Agatha's hand to her own center, showing her how wet and ready she was. Agatha's fingers slid easily into Rio's warmth, eliciting a soft, breathy moan. Rio's body trembled as Agatha's fingers moved in and out, slowly at first, then with increasing pace.</p><p><em>"That's it,"</em> Rio whispered, her voice hoarse. <em>"Don’t stop. Make me forget everything but you."</em></p><p>Agatha complied, her own desire spurring her on. She added a second finger, stretching Rio open as she sought out her sweet spot. Rio's hips bucked off the bed, her back arching as Agatha's skilled fingers brought her closer to the edge.</p><p><em>"Shh, Rio, try to be quiet,"</em> Agatha whispered, her lips muffling Rio's moans as she kissed her passionately. <em>"We don't want to wake the others."</em></p><p>Rio nodded, her eyes glazed with pleasure, as she clung to Agatha, her body moving in sync with her lover's fingers. Agatha's free hand cupped Rio's breast, pinching the hardened nipple between her thumb and forefinger, eliciting another wave of pleasure.</p><p><em>"I love how responsive you are,"</em> Agatha whispered, her breath hot against Rio's ear. <em>"You're so wet for me."</em></p><p>Rio's response was a series of incoherent moans as her body tensed, every muscle tightening as she rode the waves of her orgasm. Agatha continued her relentless assault, her fingers moving in and out, drawing out Rio's pleasure until she collapsed, boneless, onto the bed.</p><p>As Rio's breathing slowly returned to normal, Agatha withdrew her fingers, bringing them to her lips and sucking them clean, her eyes never leaving Rio's. <em>"You're exquisite,"</em> she said, her voice husky with desire. <em>"I want to taste you now."</em></p><p>Rio's eyes widened with anticipation as Agatha moved down her body, kissing and licking her way down Rio's stomach, leaving a trail of goosebumps in her wake. When Agatha's tongue finally reached Rio's glistening slit, she moaned, her hands gripping the sheets.</p><p>Agatha's tongue was like a skilled lover, flicking and probing, finding all the right spots. She teased Rio's clit, circling it gently before sucking it between her lips, sending shockwaves of pleasure through Rio's body. Rio's hips bucked uncontrollably, her hands now tangled in Agatha's hair, guiding her movements.</p><p><em>"Oh God, Agatha, yes!"</em> Rio cried out; her voice muffled by the pillow as she tried to keep her moans contained. <em>"I’m gonna come again, please."</em></p><p>Agatha obliged; her passion fueled by Rio's unrestrained desire. She inserted two fingers into Rio's pulsing heat, curling them to hit her G-spot while her tongue continued its relentless assault on Rio's clit. Rio's body trembled, her orgasm building quickly, her juices flowing freely.</p><p><em>"That's it, Rio, let it all out,"</em> Agatha whispered, her mouth never leaving Rio's sweet center.</p><p>Rio's body convulsed, her thighs clamping around Agatha's head as she came hard, her cries muffled by the pillow. Agatha held her through the waves of pleasure, continuing to lap at her sensitive clit, drawing out every last drop of ecstasy.</p><p>As Rio lay panting, her body sated and satisfied, Agatha crawled up her body, kissing her softly. <em>"You're incredible,"</em> she whispered, her eyes sparkling with love. <em>"I could do this all night."</em></p><p>Rio smiled, her fingers tracing Agatha's jawline. <em>"So would I. But first, let me return the favor."</em></p><p><em>"I want to show you how much you mean to me, Agatha,"</em> Rio whispered, her voice hoarse with emotion. <em>"Let me make you feel as incredible as you've made me feel."</em></p><p>Agatha's heart fluttered at Rio's words. She could see the sincerity in her eyes, the genuine desire to please. <em>"You already have, Rio,"</em> she replied, her voice laced with desire. <em>"But I would love to experience your touch, to feel your passion."</em></p><p>Rio's confidence grew as she straddled Agatha's thighs, her knees on either side of her lover's slender waist. She leaned down, capturing Agatha's lips in a hungry kiss. Their mouths moved in perfect sync, tongues dancing and exploring, tasting each other's desire. Rio's hands roamed freely, caressing Agatha's face, her soft cheeks, and then trailing down to her neck, leaving a trail of goosebumps in their wake.</p><p>Agatha moaned into the kiss, her hands running through Rio's wet hair, pulling her closer. She could feel Rio's passion building, and it ignited a fire within her own body. Breaking the kiss, Rio began a slow descent, trailing kisses down Agatha's neck, her collarbone, and then further down, until she reached the valley between Agatha's breasts.</p><p>Rio's breath was hot against Agatha's sensitive skin, causing her to squirm beneath her. She planted soft kisses on each breast, her lips lingering on the erect nipples, teasing them with her tongue. Agatha arched her back, pushing her chest towards Rio's mouth, craving more. Rio obliged, suckling on one nipple while her fingers gently rolled the other between them, eliciting a series of gasps and moans from Agatha.</p><p><em>"Oh, Rio..."</em> Agatha breathed, her hands gripping the sheets. <em>"You're incredible."</em></p><p>Rio smiled against her breast, her warm breath causing Agatha's nipple to pebble even further. She loved the way Agatha responded to her touch, the way her body quivered with desire. With deliberate slowness, Rio trailed her kisses down Agatha's stomach, pausing to blow gently on her navel, making Agatha giggle and squirm.</p><p>As Rio's lips reached the elastic waistband of Agatha's panties, she paused, looking up at her lover with a mischievous glint in her eyes. <em>"Are you ready for me?"</em> she asked, her voice husky.</p><p>Agatha's breath hitched as she nodded eagerly. <em>"Please, Rio... I'm aching for you."</em></p><p>Rio gently tugged at the fabric, slowly sliding Agatha's panties down her thighs, revealing her glistening pussy. She took a moment to admire the sight, the pink folds glistening with arousal, the scent of Agatha's desire filling her senses.</p><p><em>"You're so beautiful,"</em> Rio whispered, her voice filled with awe. <em>"I want to taste every inch of you."</em></p><p>With that, Rio dove in, her tongue flicking out to taste Agatha's essence. She started slowly, gently lapping at the sensitive bundle of nerves, making Agatha's hips buck against her mouth. Rio's hands gripped Agatha's thighs, holding her in place as she continued her sensual assault.</p><p>Agatha's moans filled the room as Rio's tongue delved deeper, exploring every crease and fold. She sucked on Agatha's clit, drawing it into her mouth and swirling her tongue around it, sending waves of pleasure through Agatha's body. Rio's fingers joined the dance, slipping inside Agatha's wetness, curling and stroking, finding the sweet spot that had her lover crying out in ecstasy.</p><p><em>"Yes, Rio... right there!"</em> Agatha whispered breathlessly, her hands now gripping Rio's head, urging her closer. She bit the back of her free hand to suppress the loud noises coming out of her mouth.</p><p>Rio increased the pace, her tongue and fingers working in perfect harmony. She could feel Agatha's orgasm building, her body tensing, and her breath coming in short gasps. With one final flick of her tongue and a deep thrust of her fingers, Agatha's body convulsed, her juices flowing freely as she cried out Rio's name in the pillow that she barely had managed to grip to muffle her voices.</p><p>Rio savored the taste of Agatha's release, her own body throbbing with arousal from the experience of giving pleasure. She slowly withdrew her fingers, leaving Agatha's body trembling and sated.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes, her gaze filled with adoration and satisfaction. <em>"That was... extraordinary,"</em> she whispered, reaching out to caress Rio's cheek.</p><p>Rio smiled; her face flushed with pleasure. <em>"I'm glad you enjoyed it. But I'm not done yet."</em></p><p>With a playful glint in her eyes, Rio positioned herself between Agatha's thighs once more, this time settling into a comfortable position, her legs bent at the knees. She leaned forward, her breasts brushing against Agatha's thighs, and whispered, <em>"Hold on tight, because I plan to take us on a wild ride."</em></p><p>Agatha's curiosity piqued, she wrapped her legs around Rio's waist, locking her ankles together. <em>"I'm ready for whatever you have in store, Rio."</em></p><p>Rio's lips curved into a satisfied smile. With a slow, deliberate motion, she began to rock her hips, rubbing her wet heat against Agatha's, creating a delicious friction. Their bodies moved in a sensual rhythm, skin sliding against skin, their moans mingling in the air.</p><p>Rio's hands found Agatha's breasts, squeezing and kneading them as she continued the sensual grind. Agatha's hands roamed over Rio's back, her nails gently scraping, eliciting a series of shivers from Rio. The pleasure was mutual, building with each thrust of their hips, their bodies becoming a tangle of limbs and desire.</p><p><em>"Oh, Rio... this feels so good,"</em> Agatha panted, her nails digging into Rio's shoulders. </p><p>Rio's breath was coming in short gasps as she focused on the incredible sensations. She quickened her pace, her clit rubbing against Agatha's, their juices mixing and creating a slippery, sensual mess. The room was filled with the muffled sounds of their pleasure.</p><p>As the intensity peaked, Rio felt her orgasm building, a familiar tightening in her lower abdomen. She threw her head back, her hair cascading down her back, and bit the inside of her cheek to suppress the cries as wave after wave of pleasure washed over her. Agatha matched her climax, their bodies trembling in unison, their juices flowing freely as they rode the crest of their shared orgasm.</p><p>They collapsed in a heap, their limbs entangled, hearts racing, and breathless. Rio's face was buried in Agatha's neck, her lips brushing against her damp skin as she tried to catch her breath.</p><p><em>"That was... incredible,"</em> Rio managed to say between gasps. <em>"I've never felt anything like that before."</em></p><p>Agatha smiled, her fingers gently stroking Rio's hair. <em>"Me neither. You have a gift, Rio. A gift for giving pleasure."</em></p><p>Rio lifted her head, her eyes sparkling with mischief. <em>"And I plan to use that gift to keep you satisfied. But for now, let's just enjoy this moment."</em></p><p>They lay there, wrapped in each other's arms, their bodies still buzzing with the aftermath of their passionate lovemaking. Rio's heart was filled with contentment, knowing that she had not only returned the favor but had also created a new level of intimacy between them. As they drifted off to sleep, Rio couldn't help but wonder what other pleasures awaited them in the days to come.</p><p>The night had been a testament to their love and desire, and it was just the beginning of a journey filled with unbridled passion.</p><p> </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The first rays of sunlight crept through the blinds, painting the room in soft hues of gold and pink. Agatha stirred, blinking groggily as the warmth of the morning light pulled her from sleep. She shifted slightly, her arm brushing against bare skin, and her breath hitched as her eyes focused on the figure curled up beside her.</p><p>Rio lay nestled in her arms, her hair a wild tangle against the pillow. Her peaceful expression, softened by sleep, made her seem younger, more vulnerable than the fiery troublemaker Agatha had grown so accustomed to. The faintest smile tugged at Agatha’s lips as the events of the previous night came rushing back.</p><p>Their first night together had been...intense. Beautiful. Honest. Agatha could still feel the lingering warmth of Rio’s touch, the echoes of whispered promises, and the way their hearts had seemed to beat in unison. She blushed, her cheeks turning a shade of pink that matched the morning light.</p><p>Carefully, Agatha adjusted her position, not wanting to wake Rio. She propped herself up on one elbow, her eyes tracing the curve of Rio’s face. A thought lingered at the edge of her mind, growing louder and more insistent with each passing moment.</p><p>Was she falling in love with this chaotic, unpredictable, and utterly captivating person named Rio Vidal?</p><p>Her heart thudded in response, the answer clear and undeniable. Yes. She was falling for her—hard.</p><p>The realization sent a thrill through her, but it was accompanied by a wave of nerves. Agatha wasn’t the type to lose control, to let her heart dictate her actions. But with Rio, everything felt different. Real. Unavoidable.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to Rio’s hand, resting lightly on the sheets, and she sighed softly. “What are you doing to me, Vidal?” she whispered, her voice barely audible.</p><p>It was in that moment, as she lay there surrounded by the quiet hum of morning, that Agatha made a decision. If she was going to build a life with Rio—a life filled with the messy, beautiful chaos that came with her—she needed to protect it.</p><p>Her mother, Evanora, had crossed too many lines, and Agatha wasn’t about to let her continue meddling. It was time to confront her once and for all.</p><p>Carefully, Agatha slipped out of bed, pulling the blanket higher over Rio’s sleeping form. She dressed quickly, her movements quiet and deliberate, her mind already racing with the confrontation ahead.</p><p>Before leaving the room, she paused by the door, glancing back at Rio. A small smile tugged at her lips as she whispered, “Stay out of trouble while I’m gone, Vidal.” She let out a slight sight of contentment and approached the sleeping figure, she leaned and planted a gentle kiss on her exposed temple, softly enough to not wake her up.</p><p>Closing the door softly behind her, Agatha made her way to the kitchen, grabbing a quick cup of coffee to steady her nerves. The morning air was crisp as she stepped outside, her resolve hardening with each step she took toward her mother’s domain.</p><p> </p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>Evanora Harkness’s home was a stark contrast to Agatha’s world—a pristine, sterile fortress of control. The sight of it made Agatha’s stomach churn, but she pushed the feeling aside as she knocked on the heavy wooden door.</p><p>The door opened moments later to reveal Evanora, her sharp eyes narrowing slightly at the sight of her daughter. “Agatha,” she said, her tone clipped. “This is an unexpected visit.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, Mother,” Agatha said, her voice cool but firm. “I’m not here for pleasantries.”</p><p>Evanora arched an eyebrow, stepping aside to let Agatha in. “I assumed as much. Come in, then.”</p><p>Agatha entered the house, her posture rigid as she turned to face her mother. “I’m here to make something very clear. You are to stay away from my life. My friends. My...family.”</p><p>Evanora’s expression didn’t waver, though a flicker of amusement danced in her eyes. “Family? I wasn’t aware you had one.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “Rio. Billy. Wanda. They’re my family, whether you like it or not. And your meddling stops now.”</p><p>Evanora’s lips curved into a cold smile. “Is that so? And what exactly do you think you can do to stop me, Agatha? You’ve always been so...idealistic.”</p><p>Agatha took a step closer, her voice steady and unyielding. “I can do plenty. I’m not the scared little girl you used to control, Mother. You may think you hold all the power, but you’re wrong.”</p><p>Evanora tilted her head, her smile fading slightly. “You’ve grown bold. I’ll give you that.”</p><p>“This isn’t about boldness,” Agatha said, her eyes blazing. “It’s about protecting the people I care about. So here’s your warning: stay out of my life, or I’ll make sure you regret ever interfering.”</p><p>Evanora’s sharp eyes bore into Agatha’s as if searching for cracks in her resolve. When she found none, her lips curled into a sneer, her usual mask of calm shattering into cold disdain.</p><p>“You’re an abomination,” Evanora spat, her voice low and venomous.</p><p>Agatha flinched, but she stood her ground, refusing to let her mother see how deeply the words cut. “I’m not here for your approval, Mother.”</p><p>Evanora laughed bitterly, her tone dripping with mockery. “Approval? Don’t be ridiculous, Agatha. I wouldn’t approve of the circus you’re running even if you begged me. A family,” she hissed, “is a man and a woman, not...whatever vile parody of normalcy you’ve conjured up with that girl and that orphan.”</p><p>Agatha’s fists clenched at her sides, her nails digging into her palms. “They’re my family,” she said, her voice trembling but firm. “And I won’t let you take that away from me.”</p><p>Evanora took a step closer, her eyes narrowing. “This fling with Rio—this disgusting phase—it ends now. If you don’t, you’ll find yourself in trouble, Agatha. Real trouble.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and defiance. “No,” she said, her voice steady despite the storm raging inside her. “I won’t stop seeing Rio, and I won’t abandon Billy. You don’t control me anymore.”</p><p>Evanora’s expression darkened, her face twisting with fury. “You ungrateful little bitch,” she snarled. “After everything I’ve done for you, this is how you repay me? Fine. If you want to defy me, then you’ll suffer the consequences.”</p><p>Agatha barely had time to react before Evanora grabbed her wrist in an iron grip. “What are you—?” Agatha began, but the words died in her throat as Evanora yanked her toward the basement door.</p><p>Evanora pulled open the heavy door, revealing the dark, musty staircase leading to the basement. Agatha struggled against her grip, her panic mounting as she realized what was happening.</p><p>“Let me go!” Agatha shouted, but Evanora was stronger than she appeared, her grip unrelenting as she dragged her daughter down the stairs.</p><p>At the bottom, Evanora shoved Agatha into the dimly lit room. Agatha stumbled, catching herself against the cold stone wall as she turned to face her mother. “You can’t do this!” she said, her voice shaking with a mixture of anger and fear.</p><p>Evanora smirked, pulling Agatha’s phone from her pocket and holding it up mockingly. “Oh, but I can. You’ve left me no choice, Agatha.”</p><p>She turned the phone over in her hands before pocketing it. “Now you won’t have any way of contacting your little fake family.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened, her heart sinking. “Mother, don’t—”</p><p>Evanora stepped back, her smirk widening as she reached for the door. “I did warn you,” she said coldly. “Perhaps some time alone will remind you where your loyalties should lie.”</p><p>The door slammed shut, the sound of the lock clicking into place echoing through the basement like a final nail in a coffin. Agatha pounded on the door, shouting for her mother, but the only response was the fading sound of Evanora’s footsteps ascending the stairs.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the door, her breathing heavy as she fought back the rising tide of panic. The basement was cold and damp, the faint smell of mildew clinging to the air. She wrapped her arms around herself, sinking to the floor as her mind raced.</p><p>She had known her mother was capable of cruelty, but this...this was a new low. Anger bubbled beneath her fear, fueling her determination. She wouldn’t let Evanora win. Somehow, she would find a way out—she had to.</p><p>As the darkness of the basement closed in around her, one thought remained clear in her mind: she needed to get back to Rio, Billy, and Wanda. Her family.</p><p>Upstairs in the quiet of her pristine home, Evanora sat in her ornate chair, Agatha’s phone glowing softly in her hand. Her lips curled into a cruel smile as she scrolled through the messages, quickly finding Rio’s number.</p><p>“Time to cut off this...distraction,” she murmured to herself.</p><p>She opened the messaging app and began to type, her sharp mind crafting each word like a dagger meant to pierce.</p><p>The screen lit up with the chilling message Evanora carefully composed:</p><p>
<em>Rio, I’ve thought a lot about us, and I realize now that this relationship was a mistake. You’re...too much of a burden in my life. Your chaos, your unpredictability—it’s exhausting. I thought I could handle it, but I can’t.</em>
</p><p>
<em>You’ve brought nothing but complications into my life, and it’s clear to me now that I deserve better. Someone who matches my drive and ambition. Someone who isn’t a walking disaster.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I’ve come to my senses, and I need to put myself first for once. Please don’t contact me again. I wish you well, but I can’t have you in my life anymore. Goodbye, Rio.</em>
</p><p>She read it over twice, her expression cold and calculating, before hitting send. The phone chimed softly, signaling the delivery of the message. Evanora smirked, setting the phone aside as if discarding a tool that had served its purpose.<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~</p><p>Miles away, Rio lay sprawled on the couch, a blanket draped haphazardly over her legs. Her phone buzzed on the coffee table, and she lazily reached for it, expecting a random notification or a silly meme from Wanda.</p><p>Instead, her heart stopped as she saw the preview of Agatha’s name. Frowning, she opened the message, her eyes scanning the words with growing disbelief and pain.</p><p>Each sentence hit her like a physical blow, stealing the air from her lungs. Her vision blurred as the meaning sank in, the carefully chosen words cutting straight to her deepest insecurities.</p><p>
<em>Too much of a burden.</em><br/>
<em>Your chaos...your unpredictability.</em><br/>
<em>A walking disaster.</em>
</p><p>Her hands shook as she reread the message, trying to convince herself it wasn’t real. But there it was, in black and white. The love she thought they shared, the safety and connection she’d finally found—it was gone. Torn away with cruel precision.</p><p>A strangled sob escaped her lips as she curled in on herself, the phone slipping from her fingers onto the floor. For a moment, she couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think. All she could feel was the overwhelming weight of rejection and loss.</p><p>She had been too much. Again. Just like always.</p><p>Rio wiped at her eyes, her breathing uneven as she reached for the phone again. Her finger hovered over the call button, desperate to hear Agatha’s voice, to demand an explanation. But the final words of the message echoed in her mind:</p><p>
<em>Please don’t contact me again.</em>
</p><p>Her hand fell away, and her chest tightened painfully. If Agatha didn’t want her, she wouldn’t beg. She couldn’t. Not again. She had learned the hard way that people left, and it was better to let them go than to fight a losing battle.</p><p>“I should’ve known better,” she whispered to herself, her voice breaking. “I should’ve known.”</p><p>Tears slid down her cheeks as she curled tighter into the couch, clutching the blanket around her like it could shield her from the sharp edges of the world. All she knew was the ache in her chest and the unbearable silence left in Agatha’s absence.</p><p>The apartment door creaked open as Wanda stepped inside, balancing a few bags of groceries in her arms. “Hey, I’m back!” she called, kicking the door shut behind her. She expected to hear Rio’s sarcastic response or Billy shouting from the shower, but the silence that greeted her was unsettling.</p><p>“Rio?” Wanda set the bags on the counter, her brow furrowing as she noticed the dim light in the living room. Turning the corner, she froze.</p><p>Rio was curled up on the couch, her knees pulled to her chest, her face buried in her arms. Her shoulders shook with silent sobs, and the sight sent a pang of worry through Wanda’s chest.</p><p>“Rio?” Wanda said gently, rushing to her side. She knelt by the couch, her hand hovering uncertainly before resting lightly on Rio’s arm. “What’s going on? Are you okay?”</p><p>Rio didn’t lift her head, but she reached out blindly, her phone slipping from her fingers and landing on the cushion between them. Wanda hesitated, her confusion growing as she picked it up and saw the message on the screen.</p><p>Her eyes widened as she read the text from Agatha—or rather, what appeared to be from Agatha. Wanda’s stomach churned, and she shook her head in disbelief. “This...this doesn’t sound like Agatha.”</p><p>Rio finally lifted her head, her tear-streaked face filled with raw anguish. “Maybe it doesn’t,” she said, her voice hoarse, “but it doesn’t matter. It sounds like me.”</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Wanda asked, sitting back on her heels. “Rio, this isn’t you. This is—this is wrong. Agatha wouldn’t do this. She would’ve talked to me first. She would’ve—”</p><p>Rio cut her off with a bitter laugh, the sound hollow and broken. “Wanda, don’t you get it? She didn’t have to talk to you because it’s the truth. I’m a walking disaster. A burden. I don’t deserve love, and I shouldn’t have asked for it in the first place.”</p><p>“Stop it,” Wanda said firmly, grabbing Rio’s hands. “Don’t do this to yourself. You know that’s not true.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, her tears falling harder. “It is. It’s always been true. Every time I think I can be happy, I screw it up. I ruin everything. And Agatha finally realized it. She’s better off without me.”</p><p>Wanda’s heart ached at the despair in Rio’s voice, but she tightened her grip on her hands, willing her words to break through. “Rio, listen to me. That message—it’s not Agatha. Something’s off. I can feel it. You have to believe me.”</p><p>Rio pulled her hands away, standing abruptly and pacing the room. “I can’t, Wanda. I can’t sit here and pretend everything’s okay. I need to get out of here. I need air.”</p><p>Wanda stood quickly, blocking Rio’s path. “Rio, please. Don’t do this. Let’s talk about it. Let me help you figure this out.”</p><p>“I can’t,” Rio said, her voice cracking. “I can’t stay here right now, Wanda. I’ll lose it.”</p><p>“Then let me go with you,” Wanda pleaded. “Don’t do this alone.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, backing away. “No. I need to be alone. Just...don’t follow me.”</p><p>Wanda hesitated, torn between respecting Rio’s wishes and the fear of letting her go in such a fragile state. Before she could decide, Rio grabbed her jacket and slipped out the door, leaving Wanda standing in the middle of the apartment, her heart sinking.</p><p>Wanda stared at the closed door, her mind racing. Something about the message didn’t sit right with her. The words were cruel, cutting, but they lacked Agatha’s signature warmth—even in moments of frustration.</p><p>She clenched her fists, her resolve hardening. “This doesn’t add up,” she muttered to herself. “Something’s going on, and I’m going to figure it out.”</p><p>She grabbed her phone, dialing Agatha’s number. When it went straight to voicemail, her unease deepened. Something was very, very wrong.</p><p>Wanda paced the living room, her phone pressed tightly to her ear. She had been calling Agatha repeatedly, her frustration mounting with each unanswered ring.</p><p>“Come on, Agatha, pick up!” she muttered, her voice tense.</p><p>When the call went to voicemail yet again, Wanda nearly threw her phone across the room. Instead, she let out an angry growl, running a hand through her hair as she hit redial.</p><p>“Straight to voicemail,” she gritted through clenched teeth. “Unbelievable.”</p><p>The phone buzzed in her ear, the same mechanical voice informing her that the person she was trying to reach was unavailable. Her patience snapped.</p><p>Wanda waited for the beep before unleashing her frustration. “Agatha fucking Harkness, pick up your damn phone RIGHT NOW, or I swear to God, next time I see you, I’m going to punch you right on the nose!”</p><p>She began pacing again, her free hand gesturing wildly as she vented into the voicemail. “What the fuck did you send Rio? Where the fuck are you? Call me fucking ASAP before I lose my mind!”</p><p>Hanging up, Wanda let out a loud groan of exasperation, her face flushed with anger and worry. She gripped her phone tightly, debating whether to throw it or redial for the umpteenth time.</p><p>At that moment, Billy emerged from the bathroom, a towel slung over his shoulder and damp hair sticking to his forehead. He stopped mid-step, his eyes narrowing as he took in Wanda’s furious pacing and the tension in the room.</p><p>“What’s going on?” he asked, his voice cautious.</p><p>Wanda turned to him, her hands on her hips. “Agatha’s not answering her phone, and Rio just left after getting the most bullshit text message I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Billy frowned, his concern deepening. “What kind of message?”</p><p>“The kind that makes someone feel like absolute crap,” Wanda said sharply, her voice softening slightly as she saw the alarm in Billy’s eyes. “She thinks Agatha sent it, but I’m not so sure. It doesn’t sound like her at all.”</p><p>Billy furrowed his brow, stepping closer. “So what do we do?”</p><p>Wanda took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. “I’m going to keep calling Agatha until she answers. Something’s not right, and I’m going to find out what.”</p><p>Billy nodded, his worry evident. “Do you think Rio’s okay? Should we go after her?”</p><p>Wanda hesitated, glancing at the door. “I don’t know. She said she needed space. I don’t want to push her further, but...I hate letting her go like this.”</p><p>Billy sat on the edge of the couch, his hands twisting the towel nervously. “Rio’s strong, but...if something’s wrong with Agatha, we need to figure it out fast.”</p><p>Wanda gave him a grim nod, her fingers already dialing Agatha’s number again. “Don’t worry, Billy. I’ll get to the bottom of this. One way or another.”</p>

<p>Rio’s mind was a haze as she wandered aimlessly through the streets, her legs carrying her without thought or purpose. Tears blurred her vision, and she barely registered the passing faces or the chill of the morning air. The ache in her chest was unbearable, her thoughts looping endlessly over the cruel words in Agatha’s message.</p><p>She wasn’t sure how much time had passed when she looked up and realized where she was—the campus dorms. Her heart clenched as she recognized the building and, without thinking, she climbed the familiar stairs to the fourth floor. Before she knew it, she was standing in front of Room 408.</p><p>Alice’s room.</p><p>She hesitated for a moment, her hand hovering over the door. <em>What am I even doing here?</em> she thought. But the ache in her chest and the need for comfort overpowered her doubts. Taking a shaky breath, she knocked gently.</p><p>The door creaked open, revealing Alice Wu-Gulliver, her short hair slightly messy from what was likely a morning of studying. Her sharp eyes widened when she saw Rio standing there, looking utterly wrecked.</p><p>“Rio?” Alice said, concern lacing her voice. “What the hell happened to you?”</p><p>Rio gave her a weak smile, her voice hoarse. “Got any alcohol lying around?”</p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow, glancing at the clock on the wall behind her. “It’s 10 am, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, her lips twitching into a humorless smirk. “Does it matter?”</p><p>Alice sighed, stepping aside to let her in. “No, but what matters is that you look like you’ve been hit by a truck. Get in here.”</p><p>Alice closed the door behind Rio and guided her to the small couch in the corner of the room. Without a word, she went to her kitchenette, returning a few minutes later with a steaming cup of tea.</p><p>“Drink this,” Alice said, handing the cup to Rio. “You’re not getting any alcohol out of me right now, but tea? That I can do.”</p><p>Rio took the cup reluctantly, the warmth seeping into her cold hands. She stared into the liquid for a moment before taking a small sip. The silence stretched between them until Alice broke it.</p><p>“So,” Alice began, sitting on the armrest of the couch, “you gonna tell me what’s going on? Or do I have to guess?”</p><p>Rio let out a shaky breath, her shoulders slumping. “Agatha dumped me.”</p><p>Alice blinked, caught off guard. “What? That doesn’t make sense. You two seemed so solid.”</p><p>Rio laughed bitterly, the sound hollow. “Yeah, well, apparently I’m a burden. A walking disaster. Too much for her to handle.”</p><p>Alice’s brows knitted together in confusion and concern. “She actually said that?”</p><p>Rio pulled her phone from her pocket, scrolling to the message and handing it to Alice. “Read it yourself.”</p><p>Alice read the text, her eyes narrowing with every word. When she finished, she handed the phone back with a scowl. “Okay, this doesn’t sound like Agatha. At all.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, setting the phone aside. “Maybe not to you. But to me? It’s exactly what I’ve always feared. She just finally had the guts to say it.”</p><p>Alice leaned forward, her tone firm. “Rio, listen to me. I’ve known Agatha for a while—mostly through you—but she doesn’t strike me as the type to just...ghost someone like this. And those words? They’re not her. Something’s off.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, her voice breaking. “It doesn’t matter, Alice. Whether it’s her or not, it’s the truth. I’ve been a mess my whole life, and I should’ve known better than to think someone like Agatha could handle me.”</p><p>Alice sighed, reaching out to place a comforting hand on Rio’s shoulder. “You need to stop beating yourself up. Seriously. Whatever this is, we’ll figure it out. But first, you need to breathe, okay?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her breathing shaky, but eventually nodded. “Okay.”</p><p>They sat in silence for a while, the warmth of the tea and Alice’s steady presence grounding Rio slightly. Alice watched her carefully, her mind racing with questions. She didn’t know Agatha well enough to accuse her outright, but something about the situation felt wrong.</p><p>Alice finally spoke, her tone softer. “You know, you don’t have to figure this out alone. I’ve got your back.”</p><p>Rio gave her a faint, tired smile. “Thanks, Alice. I mean it.”</p><p>Alice nodded, her lips quirking into a small grin. “Of course. Someone’s got to keep you out of trouble, right?”</p><p>Rio chuckled weakly, the sound barely there but genuine. For the first time that morning, she felt a sliver of hope. Maybe, just maybe, she wasn’t as alone as she thought.</p><p>Rio sipped the tea slowly, her hands trembling as she clutched the warm mug. The comforting aroma did little to settle the storm raging inside her. Her tears had subsided for the moment, but her swollen eyes and trembling breaths betrayed the turmoil within.</p><p>Alice sat quietly nearby, her gaze steady as she watched Rio. She knew better than to push too hard; Rio’s walls were high, and right now, they were crumbling under the weight of her pain.</p><p>“Do you want to lie down?” Alice asked gently after a moment. “You look like you haven’t slept in days.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her voice hoarse. “I don’t want to bother you more than I already have.”</p><p>Alice waved her off, standing to grab an extra blanket. “You’re not bothering me, Vidal. My bed’s more comfortable than that couch, and you need the rest.”</p><p>Alice led Rio to the small twin bed against the far wall. As Rio sank onto the mattress, the tears she had fought so hard to suppress began to well up again. She pulled the blanket around her shoulders, curling into herself as sobs shook her body.</p><p>“I don’t even know why I’m crying,” Rio whispered between broken breaths. “It’s not like I didn’t see this coming. I’m...I’m a mess. I ruin everything. I should’ve just kept my distance.”</p><p>Alice sat beside her, her hand resting lightly on Rio’s back. “Stop,” she said softly but firmly. “You’re not a mess, and you’re not ruining anything. Whatever’s going on, it’s not your fault.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, her voice trembling as she whispered, “It is. It always is. I’m too much—too loud, too chaotic. No one can handle me for long.”</p><p>Her words dissolved into quiet sobs, her self-loathing spilling out in whispers that Alice barely caught. The pain in Rio’s voice was raw, and it cut through Alice’s usual calm demeanor.</p><p>“Hey,” Alice said, her tone firm as she leaned closer. “You’re not too much. And you deserve better than whatever’s going on right now. Don’t let one message define you. You’re stronger than this.”</p><p>But Rio didn’t respond. Her tears continued to fall, her whispers of self-doubt and pain eventually fading into silence as exhaustion took over. Alice stayed with her, sitting quietly by her side until Rio’s breathing evened out and she drifted into a restless sleep.</p><p>It was nearing noon when Alice carefully stood, stretching her stiff limbs. Rio remained curled on the bed, her face still streaked with dried tears but peaceful in sleep. Alice grabbed her phone, scrolling through a delivery app to order something simple—comfort food that Rio wouldn’t refuse.</p><p>She ordered a couple of sandwiches, a soup, and some pastries, knowing that Rio would need something to eat when she woke up. After placing the order, Alice glanced back at the bed, her expression softening.</p><p>“You’re stronger than you think, Vidal,” she murmured to the quiet room. “And you’ve got people who care about you—whether you believe it or not.”</p><p>Alice returned to her desk, pulling out a notebook to occupy her mind while keeping a close eye on Rio. The silence in the room felt heavy, but it was a comforting kind of stillness—a pause in the chaos, offering Rio the space she needed to begin healing.</p><p> </p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>Wanda sat at the kitchen table, a notebook in front of her and a pen tapping rhythmically against its edge. Billy sat across from her, his brows furrowed as he leaned on his elbows.</p><p>“This doesn’t make sense,” Billy said, shaking his head. “Why would Agatha send a message like that? She was fine yesterday.”</p><p>“She didn’t,” Wanda said firmly, her lips pressing into a thin line. “I know Agatha better than almost anyone. This isn’t her. It doesn’t sound like her, it doesn’t feel like her, and she wouldn’t have done something this cruel without talking to me first.”</p><p>Billy tilted his head. “Then who?”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes narrowed as a name surfaced in her mind, her voice quiet but sharp. “Evanora.”</p><p>Billy froze. “You think...her mom?”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her expression dark. “It’s the only thing that makes sense. Maybe Agatha went to talk to her about what happened in court... What if something happened? What if Evanora—”</p><p>“—did something to Agatha?” Billy finished, his voice soft with worry.</p><p>Wanda’s stomach twisted, but she nodded. “I don’t know how, but I’m sure she’s involved. The question is how we figure it out.”</p><p>The two sat in silence for a moment before Billy spoke, his voice hesitant. “What if I...went to her?”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes snapped up to meet his. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Billy shifted uncomfortably but pushed forward. “I could go to Evanora’s house. Pretend I need her help. Say I’m sorry for causing trouble, that I’m scared of what’s happening with Rio and you and Agatha.”</p><p>Wanda frowned, her protective instincts kicking in. “That’s dangerous, Billy.”</p><p>“But she might believe me,” Billy said, his voice firm. “She saw me when she came here, right? Maybe she thinks I’m just a scared kid. If I act like I’m looking for someone to save me, maybe she’ll let me stay for a day or two.”</p><p>“And then what?” Wanda asked, though she was clearly considering the idea.</p><p>Billy straightened. “Then, at night, I look around. Try to figure out what happened to Agatha. If I find something, I call you, and you and Rio sneak in.”</p><p>Wanda leaned back in her chair, her mind racing. “It’s risky. What if she catches you?”</p><p>Billy’s voice softened. “Then she sees what she already thinks—a scared kid who’s in over his head. But if this is our only shot at finding out what’s going on...I want to do it.”</p><p>Wanda studied him, her heart aching at his determination. “You’re brave, Billy,” she said finally. “Braver than I’d ever expect someone your age to be. But if we’re doing this, we need to be smart.”</p><p>Wanda scribbled down the details of the plan, tweaking it as she went before reaching for her phone. “We’ll need Rio for this,” she muttered, scrolling to Rio’s number.</p><p>The phone rang twice before a voice answered—not Rio’s, but Alice’s. “Hello?”</p><p>Wanda frowned. “Alice? Why are you answering Rio’s phone?”</p><p>“She’s asleep,” Alice replied quietly. “She came to my dorm this morning. She’s...not in a good place.”</p><p>Wanda let out a slow breath, pinching the bridge of her nose. “I figured as much. Can you wake her up? It’s important.”</p><p>Alice hesitated. “She really needs the rest, Wanda. She cried herself to sleep, and I don’t want to push her.”</p><p>“I get that,” Wanda said, her tone softening. “But this is about Agatha. I think I know what’s going on, and I need Rio to hear this.”</p><p>There was a pause on the other end before Alice spoke. “Okay. Give me a minute.”</p><p>A few moments later, Rio’s groggy voice came through the line. “Wanda? What’s going on?”</p><p>“Rio,” Wanda began, her voice steady but urgent. “I think I know who sent that message. I don’t think it was Agatha.”</p><p>Rio sat up, her heart pounding. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I think it was her mother,” Wanda said bluntly. “I believe Agatha went to see Evanora, and now she’s not answering her phone. I think Evanora’s done something to her, and she used Agatha’s phone to send that message.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught, a mix of anger and fear surging through her. “What do we do?”</p><p>Wanda explained the plan, her voice calm but firm. “Billy’s going to go to Evanora’s house. Pretend he needs her help and stay there for a day or two. At night, he’ll look for Agatha and call us if he finds anything.”</p><p>Rio was silent for a moment before responding. “That’s risky.”</p><p>“I know,” Wanda admitted. “But it’s the best shot we’ve got.”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly. “Fine. I’m in.”</p><p>As the call ended, Alice watched Rio carefully. “Are you sure you’re okay to do this?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her expression hardening. “If Agatha’s in trouble, I’m not going to sit around and do nothing.”</p><p>Alice placed a hand on Rio’s shoulder, her voice steady. “Then you’ve got this. And if you need backup, you know where to find me.”</p><p>Rio gave her a small, grateful smile. “Thanks, Alice. I mean it.”</p><p>As she prepared to leave, Rio’s determination burned brighter than ever. No matter what it took, she was going to find Agatha—and make Evanora pay.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Billy stood outside Evanora Harkness’s imposing house, his heart pounding in his chest. The pristine lawn and cold, towering exterior only added to his nerves. He took a shaky breath, gripping the straps of his backpack tightly. He had rehearsed this moment with Wanda a dozen times, but now that he was here, everything felt more daunting.</p><p>“You can do this,” he whispered to himself before stepping up to the door.</p><p>The heavy knocker echoed through the still air as he rapped it against the door. Moments later, the door creaked open, revealing Evanora Harkness herself. She looked down at him, her sharp eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>“Billy, isn’t it?” she asked, her tone cold and assessing. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Billy shuffled his feet, lowering his gaze in a show of timidness. “I—I didn’t know where else to go,” he said, his voice trembling. “Everything’s a mess. Rio...Wanda...Agatha...it’s all falling apart, and I just...I need help.”</p><p>Evanora’s gaze lingered on him for a moment before she stepped aside. “Come in.”</p><p>The house was just as intimidating inside as it was outside—stark, cold, and meticulously organized. Billy felt like an intruder in a museum, every step echoing unnervingly through the quiet space.</p><p>Evanora gestured for him to sit in the formal living room. “Explain yourself,” she said, her tone sharp but curious.</p><p>Billy perched on the edge of the couch, clutching his backpack. “I just...I feel like I don’t belong with them anymore,” he said, carefully injecting his voice with a mix of desperation and hesitation. “Rio’s so...chaotic, and Wanda’s always trying to fix everything. Agatha...she’s different now. Distant. I don’t know what to do.”</p><p>Evanora raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into a faint smirk. “So, you’ve finally realized what I’ve known all along.”</p><p>Billy hesitated, playing his part. “I just want to make things right. I thought maybe...you could help me?”</p><p>Evanora’s expression softened slightly, though it didn’t lose its calculating edge. “Help you? And what exactly do you think I can do?”</p><p>Billy glanced down, feigning uncertainty. “You seem...in control. Maybe you could help me figure out what to do? I just need somewhere to think. Just for a night or two.”</p><p>Evanora studied him for a long moment, her sharp eyes scanning his face for any signs of deceit. Billy held his breath, willing himself to appear as small and vulnerable as possible.</p><p>Finally, she nodded. “Very well. You may stay here—for now. But don’t think for a moment that I’ll tolerate any nonsense.”</p><p>Billy nodded quickly, relief washing over him. “Thank you. I won’t be any trouble, I promise.”</p><p>“Good,” Evanora said, standing. “I’ll prepare the guest room. Make yourself useful and set the table for dinner.”</p><p>Billy nodded again, watching as she disappeared down the hall. The moment she was out of sight, he let out a shaky breath, his heart racing. The first part of the plan had worked. Now he just had to find out what had happened to Agatha—and survive long enough to call Wanda and Rio.</p><p>Dinner was a tense affair. Evanora made polite but pointed conversation, probing Billy for details about his time with Rio and the others. Billy stuck to the script Wanda had helped him craft, answering just enough to keep her curious without giving too much away.</p><p>When the meal was over, Evanora excused herself, leaving Billy to retreat to the guest room. He closed the door quietly, leaning against it as he tried to calm his nerves. His mind raced with possibilities: Where was Agatha? Was she even still in the house? And how long could he keep up the act before Evanora’s sharp eyes saw through him?</p><p>He pulled out his phone, sending a quick text to Wanda: <em>I’m in. No sign of her yet. I’ll start looking tonight.</em></p><p>When the house finally grew quiet, Billy slipped out of the guest room, moving as silently as he could through the darkened halls. His heart pounded with every creak of the floorboards, but he pressed on, determined to find some clue about Agatha’s whereabouts.</p><p>He checked the obvious places first—the study, the living room, the library—but found nothing. It wasn’t until he reached the basement door that he felt a chill run down his spine. The door was locked, but a faint, muffled sound came from the other side.</p><p>“Agatha?” Billy whispered, his voice barely audible.</p><p>There was no response, but the sound came again—a faint, rhythmic tapping. Billy’s stomach churned as he realized it was coming from below. He pressed his ear to the door, straining to hear more.</p><p>Before he could investigate further, he heard the unmistakable sound of footsteps approaching. Panic surged through him, and he darted back to the guest room, closing the door just as Evanora’s shadow passed by.</p><p>Billy sat on the edge of the bed, his mind racing. The basement—it had to be where Agatha was. But how was he supposed to get down there without Evanora noticing? He needed backup, and he needed it fast.</p><p>He pulled out his phone again, texting Wanda: <em>I think she’s in the basement. Door’s locked. Need help.</em></p><p>Moments later, his phone buzzed with a reply: <em>We’ll be there tonight. Stay safe.</em></p><p>Billy exhaled slowly, his resolve hardening. He had taken the first step into the lion’s den. Now it was time for the real battle to begin.</p><p>The house was dark and silent, the only sound the occasional creak of the old floorboards. Billy stood by the side door, his hands trembling slightly as he unlocked it. He stepped back, holding the door open for Wanda and Rio, who slipped inside quickly and quietly.</p><p>“Where’s Evanora?” Wanda whispered, her sharp eyes scanning the dimly lit hallway.</p><p>“Asleep,” Billy replied softly. “She went to bed a couple of hours ago. I think Agatha’s in the basement. I heard something earlier, but the door’s locked.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened, her posture stiffening. “Then we’ll get her out,” she said firmly. “Where’s the basement?”</p><p>Billy gestured toward the hall, and the three of them crept forward, their movements slow and deliberate. The door to the basement loomed ahead, its heavy wood and brass handle a foreboding barrier.</p><p>Rio crouched in front of the basement door, running her fingers over the lock with practiced ease. She glanced over her shoulder at Billy. “You’re the lookout. If you hear anything, make a noise—any noise.”</p><p>Billy nodded, his heart pounding as he took his position near the stairs, his eyes fixed on the hallway leading to Evanora’s room.</p><p>“Wanda,” Rio said, holding out her hand, “I need one of your hairpins.”</p><p>Wanda blinked, slightly taken aback. “You’ve done this before?”</p><p>Rio smirked faintly, though her voice was laced with bitterness. “Used to do it for Billy all the time. Our foster parents locked the pantry at night, but someone had to make sure he didn’t go hungry.”</p><p>Wanda hesitated for a moment before pulling a pin from her hair and handing it to Rio. “Here. Don’t break it—it’s my favorite.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly as she took the pin. “I’ll owe you a new one if I do.”</p><p>She turned back to the lock, inserting the hairpin with steady hands. The sound of metal scraping against metal filled the quiet space, each click making Billy’s nerves tighten.</p><p>As Rio worked on the lock, Wanda crouched beside her, whispering, “How long is this going to take?”</p><p>“Depends,” Rio replied, her voice calm but focused. “If it’s as simple as it looks, a couple of minutes. If not...” She trailed off, biting her lip as she adjusted the angle of the pin.</p><p>Billy shifted uneasily by the stairs, his ears straining for any sign of movement from Evanora’s room. The quiet was oppressive, every creak of the house making his heart race.</p><p>“Got it,” Rio whispered triumphantly as the lock clicked open. She pulled the door ajar and glanced back at Wanda. “Told you I could do it.”</p><p>Wanda smiled faintly, but her relief was tempered by the gravity of what lay ahead. “Let’s move.”</p><p>The three of them descended the narrow stairs, the air growing colder and heavier with each step. The faint smell of mildew lingered, and the dim light from a single bulb cast long, eerie shadows on the walls.</p><p>“Agatha?” Wanda called softly, her voice trembling slightly.</p><p>There was a muffled sound from the far corner of the basement—a faint, rhythmic tapping. Billy froze, his eyes wide. “That’s what I heard earlier,” he whispered.</p><p>Rio moved ahead, her jaw clenched as she scanned the room. “Agatha?” she called, her voice louder this time.</p><p>The tapping grew louder, more frantic, and they all turned toward the sound. In the corner, hidden behind old furniture and boxes, they saw her—Agatha, bound to a chair, her wrists tied and her mouth gagged. Her eyes widened as she saw them, relief and desperation flooding her expression.</p><p>“Agatha!” Wanda rushed forward, pulling the gag from her mouth. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha coughed, her voice hoarse. “Took you long enough,” she rasped, her lips quirking into a weak smirk despite her obvious exhaustion.</p><p>As Wanda worked to untie the ropes, Rio stood guard, her sharp eyes darting toward the stairs. “We need to move fast,” she said. “If Evanora wakes up and finds us here—”</p><p>“She won’t,” Billy interrupted, though his voice wavered slightly. “She sleeps like a rock.”</p><p>“Let’s not test that theory,” Rio muttered, glancing back at Wanda and Agatha. “You good to walk, Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, though her movements were stiff as she stood. “Yeah. Let’s get the hell out of here.”</p><p>Rio moved to Agatha’s side, slipping an arm around her waist for support. Their eyes met briefly, a thousand unspoken words passing between them. “I’ve got you,” Rio said softly.</p><p>Agatha gave her a small, grateful smile. “I know.”</p><p>The group moved quickly but quietly, retracing their steps through the basement and up the stairs. The air was thick with tension, every sound amplified as they crept toward the door.</p><p>Billy held his breath as he peeked around the corner, confirming the coast was clear. “Okay,” he whispered, waving them forward. “Let’s go.”</p><p>They slipped out of the house one by one, making a stop at the living room to pick up Agatha's discarded phone, the cool night air hitting them like a wave of freedom. As they reached the street, Wanda turned to Billy, placing a hand on his shoulder. “You did good, kid.”</p><p>Billy gave her a small, proud smile, though his nerves were still frayed. “Let’s just get out of here before she wakes up.”</p><p>Rio tightened her grip on Agatha, her voice steady but determined. “Agreed. Let’s go home.”</p><p> </p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>The car hummed softly as Wanda drove through the quiet streets, her hands gripping the wheel tightly. Billy sat in the back, his gaze flicking nervously between the two women in the front. Rio sat in the passenger seat, her head tilted slightly toward the window. Tears streamed silently down her face, catching the faint glow of the passing streetlights.</p><p>She didn’t want to cry—not now, not in front of Agatha—but the relief was overwhelming. Agatha was safe. She was here, sitting in the back seat, alive and breathing. The weight of the message she thought had ended everything between them now felt like a distant nightmare.</p><p>Rio turned her face further toward the window, hoping the darkness would conceal her tears. She couldn’t bear the thought of Agatha seeing her like this, not after everything.</p><p>Wanda glanced at her briefly, her sharp eyes catching the shimmer of tears on Rio’s cheeks. She didn’t say anything, but her lips pressed into a thin line. She focused on the road, giving Rio the space she needed.</p><p>The car pulled up to the apartment building, and Wanda shut off the engine. “Alright,” she said, her voice deliberately casual. “We’re home.”</p><p>Billy climbed out quickly, stretching his legs and glancing back at the others. Wanda looked at Rio and Agatha, her tone softening. “You two coming?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, glancing at Agatha out of the corner of her eye. “You go ahead,” she said quietly. “We’ll be in soon.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, understanding unspoken. She gestured for Billy to follow her inside, leaving Rio and Agatha alone in the cool night air.</p><p>The silence stretched between them for a moment as Rio leaned against the car, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. Agatha watched her carefully, her face soft with concern.</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha asked gently, stepping closer.</p><p>Rio let out a shaky laugh, wiping at her cheeks. “You’re asking me if I’m okay? After what you just went through?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, a small smirk tugging at her lips. “I’ve been better. But I’m here, thanks to you.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, her voice trembling. “Thanks to Wanda...You scared the hell out of me, Agatha. I thought...I thought I’d lost you.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk faded, replaced by a tenderness that she rarely let anyone see. She reached out, placing a hand on Rio’s arm. “You didn’t lose me, Rio. I’m here. And I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, and she looked away, trying to compose herself. “That message...I thought it was real. I thought you really—” She cut herself off, her voice breaking.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, her hand sliding down to take Rio’s. “That wasn’t me,” she said firmly. “You know that, right? I would never—”</p><p>“I know,” Rio interrupted, her voice barely above a whisper. “I know now. But at the time, it felt so real. Like all the things I’ve always been afraid of were finally true.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened at Rio’s words. She squeezed her hand gently, her voice soft. “You are not a burden, Rio. You are not too much. You’re...everything.”</p><p>Rio looked up at her, her tear-streaked face filled with vulnerability. “Agatha...”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her heart pounding. The words were on the tip of her tongue, threatening to spill out before she could stop them. <em>I love you.</em></p><p>But she caught herself, her voice faltering as she said instead, “You mean a lot to me, Rio. More than I can even explain.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, and a small, grateful smile broke through her tears. “You mean a lot to me too.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath, her lips twitching into a faint smile. “We’ve been through a lot, haven’t we?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, her voice steadier now. “And I don’t regret any of it. Not if it brought me to you.”</p><p>They stood there for a moment, the quiet night wrapping around them like a blanket. Agatha finally broke the silence, her tone lightening. “Come on. Let’s go inside before Wanda thinks we’ve run off.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, wiping the last of her tears. “Good idea. She’s scary when she’s mad.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, the sound warm and genuine as she led Rio toward the building. For the first time in days, it felt like things were going to be okay.</p><p>The door clicked shut as Rio and Agatha entered the apartment, the warmth and safety of the familiar space washing over them. Wanda and Billy followed closely behind, their expressions soft but tired.</p><p>Wanda clapped her hands together, her voice breaking the silence. “Alright, here’s the deal. Billy and I are taking charge of dinner tonight. You two have been through enough—go rest. We’ll call you when it’s ready.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips quirking into a smirk. “Are you sure? I don’t want to end up eating burnt pasta.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes, shooing her toward the hallway. “I’m offended you’d even suggest that. Now go, both of you. You need it.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, glancing at Agatha. “You good with that?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, a small smile tugging at her lips. “For once, I’ll let someone else take care of things.”</p><p> </p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Wanda and Billy watched as Rio and Agatha retreated to the bedroom. Once the door closed behind them, Wanda turned to Billy, rolling up her sleeves. “Alright, kid. Let’s get to work.”</p><p>The kitchen came alive with the soft clinking of pots and the rich aroma of simmering sauce. Wanda stirred the pot of red sauce with practiced ease, while Billy worked on chopping fresh herbs under her careful guidance.</p><p>“So,” Wanda began, her voice light but purposeful, “let’s talk about tonight.”</p><p>Billy glanced up from his cutting board, his brows furrowing. “What about it?”</p><p>“You,” Wanda said, turning to face him. “You were incredible, Billy. The way you handled everything, the risks you took to help us find Agatha—it was brave.”</p><p>Billy’s cheeks flushed, and he ducked his head, focusing on his task. “I just...did what needed to be done.”</p><p>Wanda set down her spoon, stepping closer to him. “No, it’s more than that. You thought on your feet, stayed calm under pressure, and kept everyone safe. That’s not just doing what needs to be done. That’s stepping up in a way most people wouldn’t.”</p><p>Billy blinked rapidly, his hands stilling as her words sank in. “I...I don’t know what to say.”</p><p>Wanda smiled softly, reaching out to place a hand on Billy’s shoulder. “You don’t have to say anything. I just wanted you to know how proud I am of you.”</p><p>Billy’s breath hitched, his throat tightening as he felt a sudden wave of emotion. “Proud?” he echoed, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>“Yes,” Wanda said firmly. “You’ve been through so much, but you’re still standing. You’re kind, smart, and braver than most adults I know. I’m proud of the young man you’re becoming.”</p><p>Billy’s hands trembled as he set the knife down, his eyes filling with tears. He turned away slightly, wiping at his face with his sleeve. “No one’s ever said that to me before.”</p><p>Wanda’s heart clenched at the raw vulnerability in his voice. She stepped closer, pulling him into a gentle hug. “Well, get used to it,” she said softly. “Because it’s true. And I’m not the only one who feels that way.”</p><p>Billy leaned into the hug, his tears falling silently as he clung to her. The warmth and care in Wanda’s words and actions were overwhelming, breaking through walls he hadn’t even realized were there. For the first time in a long time, he felt seen—truly seen.</p><p>When Billy finally pulled back, Wanda gave him a reassuring smile and handed him a fresh towel to wipe his face. “Alright, let’s finish this pasta. Think you can handle the garlic bread?”</p><p>Billy nodded, his voice steadier now. “Yeah. I can do that.”</p><p>As they worked side by side, the tension in the room eased, replaced by a quiet sense of camaraderie. By the time the pasta was plated and the bread was golden and crisp, Wanda turned to Billy, her smile widening.</p><p>“You did good, kid,” she said, her voice warm.</p><p>Billy smiled back, his confidence bolstered. “Thanks. So did you.”</p><p> </p>

<p>The bedroom door clicked softly behind Rio and Agatha, shutting out the world and leaving only the quiet sanctuary of the space they shared. The tension of the night still lingered in the air, but for the first time in what felt like an eternity, Rio and Agatha were alone, away from prying eyes and oppressive threats.</p><p>Rio exhaled deeply, her body still trembling slightly from the adrenaline and relief. Agatha stood near the edge of the bed, her gaze locked on Rio. Without a word, she opened her arms, a silent invitation that Rio couldn’t resist.</p><p>They moved toward each other, their arms wrapping tightly around one another. Rio buried her face in Agatha’s shoulder, her breath hitching as she tried to steady herself. Agatha’s hands traced soothing circles on Rio’s back, her own tears threatening to spill.</p><p>They held each other like lifelines, their embrace desperate and unyielding, as if the mere act of letting go could shatter the fragile moment of peace they had found.</p><p>Agatha pulled back slightly, just enough to meet Rio’s eyes. The intensity of her gaze made Rio’s heart ache—a mixture of gratitude, love, and something deeper, something primal.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, capturing Rio’s lips in a kiss that started soft and tender but quickly deepened into something more. Rio responded immediately, her hands sliding up to cradle Agatha’s face as their kisses grew hungrier, more urgent.</p><p>The weight of the night, the fear, and the relief all poured into the connection between them. Agatha’s hands tangled in Rio’s hair, pulling her closer, as if afraid she might disappear.</p><p>Agatha broke the kiss, her breath coming in shallow gasps. She rested her forehead against Rio’s, her voice trembling with emotion. “Please,” she whispered, her tone pleading. “I need you.”</p><p>Rio’s heart clenched at the vulnerability in Agatha’s voice. “I’m here,” she said softly, her hands brushing over Agatha’s arms. “I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head slightly, her grip tightening. “No, I mean...I need you. I need to feel you. To be close to you.”</p><p>Rio froze for a moment, her breath catching as the words sank in. Agatha’s eyes searched hers, filled with a raw desperation that made her chest ache.</p><p>“Please,” Agatha whispered again, her voice breaking. “I need to feel safe. With you.”</p><p>Rio cupped Agatha’s face gently, her thumb brushing away a stray tear. “Okay,” she said softly, her voice steady and filled with love. “I’ve got you.”</p><p>Their lips met again, slower this time but no less intense. Rio’s hands slid down Agatha’s sides, her touch reverent as she guided them both to the bed. The world outside faded away, leaving only the quiet intimacy of their connection.</p><p>They moved together with unspoken understanding, each touch and kiss a promise of safety and devotion. Agatha’s hands roamed Rio’s body, her fingers trembling slightly as she pulled her closer. Rio responded with equal fervor, her lips trailing down Agatha’s neck, her touch careful but deliberate.</p><p>Every movement was filled with care and tenderness, as if they were rediscovering each other all over again. Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s hands explored, her body arching into her lover’s touch. The vulnerability and trust between them made the moment all the more profound.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio's heart was racing as she held Agatha close, their lips locked in a passionate embrace. The bedroom door was closed, the world outside forgotten. All that mattered in this moment was the connection between these two women, their desire burning brighter than ever before. It had been a harrowing experience for both of them, and now, in the safety of their apartment, they sought solace in each other's arms.</p><p>Agatha, still shaken by her recent abduction, clung to Rio, her icy blue eyes filled with a mix of fear and desire. Her long hair, once neatly styled, now fell in messy lazy waves around her face, giving her a wild, untamed look. She wore only a loose tank top and cotton shorts, clothing she had hastily thrown on after her rescue. Rio, with sun-kissed skin and silky black hair was a vision of strength and protection. They had saved Agatha, and now, she intended to remind her lover of the power and pleasure their love could bring.</p><p>As they kissed, Rio's hands roamed over Agatha's body, mapping every curve and contour. She started at the nape of her neck, gently caressing the soft skin there, causing Agatha to shiver. Slowly, her fingers trailed down, slipping beneath the tank top to explore the smooth skin of her back. Agatha arched into the touch, her body responding instinctively, craving the sensation after the trauma it had endured.</p><p><em>"You're safe now,"</em> Rio whispered between kisses, her breath hot against Agatha's neck. <em>"I've got you.”<br/>
<br/>
</em></p><p><em> </em>Agatha nodded, her lips finding Rio's again, hungry for the taste of her. They kissed fiercely, tongues dancing and exploring, tasting each other's desperation and relief. Rio's hands continued their exploration, sliding around to cup Agatha's breasts, feeling the weight of them in her palms. Agatha gasped into the kiss, her nipples hardening instantly under the thin fabric.</p><p>With deft fingers, Rio unhooked Agatha's bra, letting it fall to the floor, and filled her hands with Agatha's full breasts. She massaged and squeezed, rolling the sensitive peaks between her thumbs and forefingers, eliciting moans of pleasure from Agatha's throat. Agatha's hands were not idle either; she tugged at Rio's shirt, eager to feel the warmth of her skin. Rio obliged, pulling the shirt over her head, revealing her toned torso and full, firm breasts.</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened at the sight, and she reached out to trace the dark areolas surrounding Rio's erect nipples. <em>"You're so beautiful,"</em> she murmured, her voice hoarse with desire. <em>"So perfect."</em></p><p>Rio smiled, her big brown eyes sparkling with mischief. <em>"And you, my sweet Agatha, are the most beautiful woman I've ever laid eyes on. I want to make you feel every inch of that beauty."</em></p><p>With that, Rio guided Agatha towards the bed, their kisses never breaking. They stumbled, giggling, onto the mattress, their bodies entwined. Rio positioned herself on top, her legs straddling Agatha's waist, giving her full access to her lover's body. She leaned down, capturing Agatha's lips once more, while her hands resumed their exploration.</p><p>Rio's fingers danced across Agatha's stomach, tracing the lines of her muscles, before dipping lower, into the waistband of her shorts. She paused, her breath catching in her throat as she felt the heat radiating from Agatha's core. <em>"You're so wet, my love,"</em> she whispered, her voice thick with desire. <em>"So ready for me."</em></p><p>Agatha blushed, her cheeks flushing with a mix of embarrassment and arousal. <em>"I can't help it,"</em> she breathed, her hands clutching at Rio's hips. <em>"I need you. I need to feel you inside me."</em></p><p>Rio's eyes darkened at the plea, and she wasted no time in granting Agatha's wish. With nimble fingers, she unbuttoned and unzipped Agatha's shorts, sliding them down her thighs, revealing her lacy black panties. Agatha lifted her hips to help, her eyes never leaving Rio's face. The sight of her lover's desire, the evidence of her arousal, was a powerful aphrodisiac for Rio.</p><p>Rio hooked her thumbs into the sides of Agatha's panties and slowly pulled them down, exposing her glistening heat. Agatha's lips were full and pink, already swollen with need, and her clit peeked out from its hood, begging for attention. Rio leaned down, her breath ghosting over Agatha's sensitive flesh, making her shiver.</p><p><em>"Oh, Rio,"</em> Agatha moaned, her hands threading through Rio's hair. <em>"Please, don't tease. I need to feel you."</em></p><p>Rio's response was to gently blow on Agatha's wetness, making her gasp and squirm beneath her. Then, with a wicked grin, she lowered her head and licked a slow, deliberate path up Agatha's slit, savoring the taste of her. Agatha's hips bucked off the bed, her hands gripping the sheets as she cried out in pleasure.</p><p><em>"Fuck, yes!"</em> she exclaimed, her body trembling. <em>"Eat me, Rio. Make me come with your mouth."</em></p><p>Rio obliged, her tongue darting and flicking, finding all the right spots. She sucked on Agatha's clit, drawing it into her mouth and swirling her tongue around the sensitive bud. Agatha's thighs clamped around Rio's head, holding her in place as wave after wave of pleasure coursed through her body.</p><p><em>"That's it, my love,"</em> Rio murmured between licks. <em>"Come for me. Let go of all the fear and just feel."</em></p><p>Agatha's orgasm built, her body coiling tighter and tighter until, with a cry, she exploded, her juices flooding Rio's mouth. Rio lapped at her eagerly, drinking in every drop, savoring the taste of her lover's release. Agatha lay panting, her body spent, as Rio crawled up her length, leaving a trail of kisses along her trembling body.</p><p><em>"That's my girl,"</em> Rio whispered, her lips brushing Agatha's ear. <em>"But we're not done yet. I want to feel you around me, Agatha. I want to fuck you until we both forget everything but this moment."</em></p><p>Agatha's eyes widened at Rio's words, her body already responding to the idea. She reached down, her fingers finding Rio's wetness, and stroked her clit, making Rio shudder. <em>"I want that too,"</em> she breathed, her voice husky. <em>"I want to feel you inside me, filling me up."</em></p><p>Rio positioned herself between Agatha's legs, her knees sinking into the mattress on either side of Agatha's thighs. She guided her fingers to Agatha's entrance, teasing her with the tip of her fingers, before slowly pushing them inside. Agatha's walls were hot and tight around her, squeezing her as she slid deeper, inch by inch her fingers now knuckle deep.</p><p><em>"Oh god, yes,"</em> Rio groaned, her eyes fluttering shut as she relished the sensation. <em>"You feel so fucking good, Agatha."</em></p><p>Agatha's hands gripped Rio's hips, urging her on. <em>"More, Rio,"</em> she begged. <em>"Fuck me harder. Make me forget everything but you."</em></p><p>Rio added another finger and began to move, pulling her fingers almost all the way out before slamming them back into Agatha, over and over, setting a relentless pace. The bed creaked with each thrust, the sound of their bodies slapping together filling the room. Rio's breasts bounced with each movement, her nipples rubbing against Agatha's body, providing additional stimulation.</p><p>Agatha's eyes were closed, her head thrown back, as she surrendered to the sensations coursing through her. Rio filled her completely, hitting all the right spots, and the friction of their bodies created a delicious heat between her legs. Rio's free hand gripped Agatha's thighs, holding her in place as she pounded into her, their sweat-slicked bodies glistening in the dim light.</p><p><em>"That's it, baby,"</em> Rio grunted, her breath coming in short gasps. <em>"Take it all. You're so tight around my fingers, Agatha.”</em></p><p>Agatha's fingers dug into Rio's flesh, her nails leaving marks as she held on, her body tensing in anticipation of her own release. <em>"Yes, Rio! Fuck me through the orgasm. I want to feel you deep inside me."</em></p><p>Rio's thrusts became wilder, her body taking over. Agatha's walls contracted around Rio, drawing out her orgasm, and she cried out, her body shaking as wave after wave of pleasure washed over her.</p><p>They collapsed in a sweaty, satisfied heap, their hearts pounding and their breath coming in ragged gasps. Rio rolled onto her side, pulling Agatha close, their foreheads touching as they both struggled to catch their breath.</p><p><em>"That was incredible,"</em> Agatha whispered, her voice hoarse. <em>"I needed that, Rio. I needed you."</em></p><p>Rio smiled, her brown eyes sparkling with satisfaction. <em>"And I'll always be here for you. Whenever you need me, I'll be ready to remind you just how alive we can be together."</em></p><p>As they lay there, entwined in each other's arms, the adrenaline from their earlier ordeal still coursing through their veins, they knew that this was just the beginning. Their love, and the passion that fueled it, would carry them through any darkness, and they would always find their way back to each other, and to the exquisite pleasure they could create together.</p><p>~~~~~~<br/>
The comforting aroma of pasta and garlic bread wafted through the apartment as Billy bounded down the hallway, excitement lighting up his face. He had been tasked with calling Agatha and Rio to dinner, and he took the responsibility with great enthusiasm.</p><p>Stopping in front of their bedroom door, he knocked briskly. “Food’s ready!” he called, his voice loud enough to carry through the closed door.</p><p>When no immediate response came, Billy frowned, his excitement dimming slightly. “Hello? Are you two asleep or what?”</p><p>Without waiting for a reply, he grabbed the doorknob and pushed it open.</p><p>Billy froze in the doorway, his eyes widening in horror as he took in the sight before him. Agatha and Rio were clearly awake, their heads peeking out from beneath the covers. Their flushed faces and the way they scrambled to adjust the blanket made it abundantly clear that he had interrupted something.</p><p>“Oh my God!” Billy shouted, his voice a mixture of shock and indignation. “What is wrong with you two? You’re traumatizing me!”</p><p>Agatha burst out laughing, burying her face in the crook of Rio’s shoulder. Rio followed suit, her laughter muffled as she pressed a hand over her mouth.</p><p>“Get out, Billy!” Agatha managed between laughs, waving him off. “Privacy, ever heard of it?”</p><p>Billy threw his hands in the air, backing out of the room dramatically. “I’m just trying to tell you dinner’s ready! You could’ve at least locked the door!”</p><p>Billy stormed back to the kitchen, his face red and his mutterings barely coherent. Wanda looked up from the counter, raising an eyebrow. “What happened?”</p><p>“Nothing!” Billy exclaimed, setting plates on the table with unnecessary force. “Nothing except Agatha and Rio trying to scar me for life!”</p><p>Wanda smirked, her lips twitching as she tried to hold back her laughter. “What did you do?”</p><p>Billy glared at her, pointing an accusatory finger. “What did <em>I</em> do? I knocked! I waited! They’re the ones—” He cut himself off, shuddering. “I don’t even want to think about it.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled, patting him on the back. “Relax, kid. It’s not the end of the world.”</p><p>“It feels like it,” Billy grumbled, placing the last fork on the table. “But whatever. Let’s just eat before they come out here and make it worse.”</p><p>Agatha and Rio appeared in the kitchen a few minutes later, looking far too cheerful for Billy’s liking. Agatha smirked at him, her tone teasing as she said, “Thanks for the heads-up, Teen.”</p><p>Rio leaned against the counter, her smile mischievous. “Yeah, Billy, next time give us a little more warning, huh?”</p><p>Billy groaned, covering his face with his hands. “Oh my God, can we not?”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes playfully, setting the pasta on the table. “Alright, enough. Let’s eat before the food gets cold.”</p><p>As they all sat down to dinner, the earlier tension of the night was replaced by warmth and laughter. Billy, though still flustered, eventually joined in the banter, his earlier embarrassment fading into the background.<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The apartment was quiet, the soft white noise of the refrigerator the only sound as everyone slept. On the living room couch, Billy twisted and turned, his face contorted with fear. His breathing quickened, his hands clutching the blanket as though it could protect him from the horrors in his dream.</p><p>In the nightmare, he was back in one of the worst foster homes he’d ever been in. The shadows were long, the voices loud and angry, and the feeling of helplessness was suffocating. He couldn’t escape the yelling, the accusations, the overwhelming sense of being unwanted.</p><p>When he jolted awake, the nightmare clung to him like a second skin. He was drenched in sweat, his heart racing and tears streaming down his cheeks. He sat up, gasping for air, his hands trembling as he rubbed at his face. The apartment was dark, but the oppressive weight of the nightmare lingered.</p><p>He couldn’t stay on the couch. Not like this.</p><p>Billy shuffled down the hallway, his bare feet silent on the cool floor. He stopped in front of Wanda’s door, hesitating as his hand hovered over the wood. His mind raced with doubts. <em>What if she’s mad? What if she tells me to go back?</em></p><p>Finally, he knocked lightly, his voice barely above a whisper. “Wanda? Are you awake?”</p><p>Inside, Wanda glanced up from her laptop, pausing the movie she was watching. She had been jotting down notes for a class project, her usual focus on storytelling merging with her dream of becoming a director. Hearing Billy’s voice, she closed her notebook and called out, “Come in.”</p><p>Billy opened the door slowly, peeking inside. Wanda was sitting up in bed, her laptop balanced on her knees, the glow illuminating her face. Her expression softened when she saw him, the redness in his eyes and the way he hugged himself betraying his distress.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” she asked gently, setting the laptop aside. “Did something happen?”</p><p>Billy hesitated, his gaze dropping to the floor. He shuffled his feet, his voice shaking. “I... I had a bad dream.”</p><p>Wanda tilted her head, her concern growing. “Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>Billy shook his head quickly, his arms wrapping tighter around himself. “No. I just... I didn’t know where else to go.”</p><p>Wanda smiled softly, patting the bed beside her. “Come here.”</p><p>Billy hesitated again, his eyes flicking up to hers. “Can I... Can I sleep with you? Just for tonight?”</p><p>Wanda’s heart clenched at the vulnerability in his voice. She shifted over, making space for him. “Of course, kiddo. Come on.”</p><p>Billy climbed onto the bed carefully, curling up close to her. Wanda grabbed the blanket, pulling it over both of them as she settled back against the pillows.</p><p>Wanda reached out, her hand gently stroking circles on Billy’s back. He tensed for a moment, the unfamiliar sensation of care catching him off guard. But as her touch continued, soothing and unhurried, he began to relax.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Wanda murmured softly, her voice steady and calming. “You’re safe here.”</p><p>Billy sniffled, his tears slowing as he nestled closer to her. The warmth of her presence and the rhythmic motion of her hand on his back slowly eased the tension in his body.</p><p>Wanda picked up her laptop again, resuming the movie she had paused. The quiet sound of dialogue filled the room, but her focus remained split between the screen and the boy beside her.</p><p>As Billy’s breathing evened out, Wanda glanced down at him. His face, so often guarded, was peaceful in sleep. She smiled faintly, her fingers continuing their gentle strokes on his back.</p><p>Hours passed, the movie playing softly in the background as Wanda continued to make notes. Billy remained curled up beside her, his body pressed close as if seeking reassurance even in sleep.</p><p>Wanda glanced at him again, her heart aching at the thought of everything he had been through. She brushed a strand of hair from his forehead, her touch featherlight.</p><p>“You’re safe now,” she whispered, though he couldn’t hear her. “I promise.”</p><p>As the night deepened, the quiet companionship between them became a silent promise—a bond of trust and care that neither of them had known they needed.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>The apartment was filled with the lazy hum of a late morning. The night’s tension had finally eased, and everyone awoke feeling slightly more rested. Agatha stretched as she shuffled into the living room, finding Wanda and Billy already dressed.</p><p>“We were thinking,” Wanda began, sipping her coffee, “how about we go out for breakfast? A proper meal might do us all some good.”</p><p>Rio, who had just stepped out of her room, ran a hand through her messy hair. “Breakfast sounds like a great idea. I’m starving.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her lips curving into a faint smile. “Alright. Let’s make it happen.”</p><p>The group settled into a cozy booth at a nearby breakfast place, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and sizzling bacon filling the air. Billy was flipping through the menu with excitement, pointing out every option to Wanda.</p><p>“I can’t decide,” Billy said, his face lighting up as he read. “Pancakes or waffles?”</p><p>“Why not both?” Wanda suggested, smiling warmly.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, glancing at Rio, who was leaning back in her seat, her eyes scanning the room absently. “What about you? Eggs Benedict again?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Maybe. Or maybe I’ll surprise you.”</p><p>They placed their orders, the easy banter continuing until Rio’s phone buzzed on the table. The number was unfamiliar, and her brows furrowed slightly as she picked it up.</p><p>“I’ll be right back,” Rio said, sliding out of the booth. She stepped outside, holding the phone to her ear.</p><p>“Hello?” Rio answered, her tone cautious.</p><p>There was a pause on the other end before a cold, familiar voice spoke. “Breaking and entering is quite the crime, Miss Vidal.”</p><p>Rio froze, her breath catching as she recognized Evanora’s voice. “What do you want?” she asked, her tone sharp.</p><p>“What I want,” Evanora continued, her voice dripping with venom, “is for you to understand the gravity of your actions. There’s so much footage of your little operation—your sneaking around my home, tampering with my property. Quite damning evidence, wouldn’t you say?”</p><p>Rio’s heart raced, her free hand curling into a fist. “You can’t be serious.”</p><p>“Oh, but I am,” Evanora said, her tone almost amused. “First you corrupt my daughter into your sinful ways and then you have the audacity to break into my own house? Have fun rotting in prison, Miss Vidal.”</p><p>Before Rio could respond, the line went dead. She pulled the phone away from her ear, staring at the screen as if willing it to explain what had just happened.</p><p>Rio re-entered the breakfast place, her expression unreadable. Agatha noticed immediately, her brow furrowing as she leaned forward. “Hey, what’s wrong?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio said quickly, sliding back into the booth. She forced a smile, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “Just a spam call.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look convinced, but before she could press further, the waiter arrived with their food, momentarily shifting the group’s focus.</p><p>As the others dug into their meals, Rio’s appetite was nowhere to be found. She pushed her eggs around her plate, her mind racing. Evanora’s words echoed in her head, the threat of prison looming like a dark cloud.</p><p><em>What now?</em> she thought, her hand tightening around the fork. <em>What the hell do I do now?</em></p><p>The breakfast table was lively, filled with the sound of cutlery clinking against plates and Billy’s enthusiastic chatter about all the options he’d seen on the menu and would love to try one day. Wanda chimed in occasionally, her tone light and teasing, while Agatha smirked at their banter.</p><p>But Rio was distant.</p><p>She sat quietly, her fork barely grazing the food on her plate. Her eyes were unfocused, staring down at the eggs she hadn’t touched. Her thoughts were far from the cozy breakfast place, replaying Evanora’s icy words over and over in her mind.</p><p>Agatha, who had been watching her closely, leaned in slightly. “Hey,” she said softly, her voice cutting through the haze of Rio’s thoughts. “You okay?”</p><p>Rio blinked, her head snapping up as she forced a smile. “Yeah. I’m fine. Just tired, I guess.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, unconvinced but choosing not to push. “Alright,” she said slowly. “But let me know if something’s up.”</p><p>Wanda caught the exchange, her sharp gaze flicking between the two women before addressing Billy. “Hey, kid,” she said, her tone playful. “How about we go shopping after this? You need some new clothes.”</p><p>Billy’s face lit up. “Really? Like, actual new clothes? Not secondhand?”</p><p>“Absolutely,” Wanda replied, grinning. “Let’s get you some stuff that actually fits. Plus, it’ll give these two some alone time to...do whatever private things they might want to do without traumatizing you.”</p><p>Billy made a gagging noise, while Agatha rolled her eyes. “Thanks, Wanda. Very subtle.”</p><p>Wanda winked. “It’s a gift.”</p><p>After breakfast, Wanda and Billy headed out, leaving Agatha and Rio alone in the apartment. The silence between them was thick, the unspoken tension lingering in the air. Rio paced the living room, her arms crossed tightly over her chest.</p><p>Agatha watched her from the couch, her concern growing. “Alright,” she said finally, her voice firm. “Out with it. What’s going on?”</p><p>Rio stopped, her back to Agatha. For a moment, she didn’t say anything, her shoulders stiff and her head bowed. Then she turned slowly, her face a mixture of fear and anger.</p><p>“It was Evanora,” she said, her voice low. “She called me.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped, her eyes narrowing. “What did she say?”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, her hands clenching into fists at her sides. “She said breaking and entering is a crime. That there’s footage of us at her house. And she said...” Her voice faltered, but she pushed on. “She said I’m going to rot in prison.”</p><p>Agatha shot to her feet, her expression darkening. “She threatened you?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her jaw tightening. “Yeah. And she sounded like she meant it.”</p><p>Agatha closed the distance between them, her hands resting gently on Rio’s arms. “You’re not going to prison,” she said firmly, her voice steady. “I won’t let that happen.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, a bitter laugh escaping her lips. “You don’t know that. She’s powerful, Agatha. She has connections, resources... She could ruin me.”</p><p>“She’s not going to ruin anyone,” Agatha said, her tone sharp. “This is just another one of her games. She’s trying to scare you, to scare us.”</p><p>“Well, it’s working,” Rio admitted, her voice breaking. “I’m scared, Agatha. I don’t want to go to jail. I don’t want to lose everything.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart ached at the fear in Rio’s voice. She pulled her closer, wrapping her arms around her tightly. “You’re not losing anything,” she murmured planting a kiss on her forehead. “We’ll figure this out. Together.”</p><p>Rio clung to her, burying her face in Agatha’s shoulder. For a moment, they stood there in silence, the weight of Evanora’s threat hanging heavily between them.</p><p>Agatha pulled back slightly, her hands resting on Rio’s shoulders as she met her gaze. “Listen to me,” she said, her voice calm but determined. “We’re not going to let her win. We’ll call Lilia, we’ll get ahead of this. She doesn’t have as much power as she wants us to think.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, her breathing evening out. “Okay,” she said quietly. “But what if she really does have footage? What if—”</p><p>“We’ll handle it,” Agatha interrupted gently. “Whatever she’s got, we’ll handle it. She doesn’t scare me.”</p><p>Rio managed a small, shaky smile. “You’re braver than I am.”</p><p>Agatha cupped her face, her thumb brushing over Rio’s cheek. “No, I’m not. You’re the bravest person I know.”</p><p>Rio leaned into her touch, her fear slowly giving way to the comfort of Agatha’s presence. “Thank you,” she whispered.</p><p>“Always,” Agatha replied, her voice soft but resolute.</p><p>Agatha paced the living room, her phone pressed tightly to her ear. Rio sat on the couch, her knees drawn to her chest, watching with a mix of nervousness and guilt as Agatha waited for the call to connect.</p><p>“Lilia Calderu speaking,” came the crisp, professional voice on the other end.</p><p>“It’s Agatha,” she began, her voice steady but tense. “We need to talk. It’s about Evanora.”</p><p>There was a pause, the weight of Lilia’s silence palpable even through the phone. “Go on,” Lilia said finally, her tone measured.</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio, who gave her a small nod of encouragement. “She’s threatened us. She has footage of us breaking into her house to get me out of that basement. And she called Rio—threatened her with prison.”</p><p>Lilia’s sharp intake of breath was followed by a slow, deliberate exhale. “Please tell me you didn’t do what I think you did, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her voice faltering. “I...went to confront her. I thought—”</p><p>“You thought?” Lilia’s voice cut through sharply, her frustration evident. “You thought you could take on Evanora Harkness alone? Without consulting me, without a plan?”</p><p>Agatha winced, guilt washing over her. “I didn’t think she’d—”</p><p>“Of course, you didn’t,” Lilia interrupted, her tone now icy. “And then your...friends,” she said, the word carrying a hint of disdain, “broke into her house. Do you understand what kind of mess you’ve made?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her voice quieter. “I understand, Lilia. But she locked me in a basement. She would’ve—”</p><p>“I know what she’s capable of, Agatha,” Lilia snapped. “I’ve spent years cleaning up the messes she leaves behind. But this? This is bad. This is very bad.”</p><p>Rio stood, crossing the room to stand beside Agatha. She touched her arm lightly, silently offering her support. Agatha took a deep breath, her voice steadier when she spoke again.</p><p>“So, what do we do?”</p><p>Lilia sighed, the sound heavy with exasperation. “First, you stop acting on impulse. No more rogue missions, no more confrontations without a plan. We’re not dealing with a petty argument here. This is war, Agatha. And you’d better be prepared for it.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said, her voice firm. “What’s the next step?”</p><p>“We need to get ahead of this,” Lilia replied, her tone shifting to something more measured and strategic. “If Evanora has footage, she’ll use it as leverage. We’ll need to challenge the validity of the evidence, find any holes we can exploit. And if she’s already made threats, we’ll document everything. Every call, every message.”</p><p>Rio’s brows furrowed. “But she said she’d go public with the footage. She wants me behind bars. How do we stop that?”</p><p>Lilia’s voice softened slightly, though her frustration lingered. “We won’t stop it outright, but we can control the narrative. If she leaks it, we make it clear that you acted out of desperation—to protect Agatha from her abusive mother. That’s a story people will sympathize with, that a <em>jury </em>would sympathize with.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened, her hands curling into fists. “I don’t want my life to become a spectacle.”</p><p>“It already is,” Lilia said bluntly. “Evanora made sure of that the moment she started this war. The only way you win is by being smarter than her. That means staying calm, staying strategic, and listening to me.”</p><p>There was a pause, the weight of Lilia’s words settling heavily over Agatha and Rio. Finally, Lilia spoke again, her voice quieter but no less firm.</p><p>“Agatha, I’m disappointed in you,” she said. “You know better than to walk into a situation like this without thinking it through. And you’ve dragged others into this mess. I understand why you did it—of course, I do—but that doesn’t make it any less reckless.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders slumped, guilt washing over her. “I’m sorry,” she murmured. “I thought I could handle it.”</p><p>“Well, you can’t,” Lilia replied, her tone softening slightly. “But you don’t have to. That’s why you have me. So, let’s focus on fixing this before it gets worse.”</p><p>Rio stepped closer, her voice quiet but steady. “Thank you, Lilia. For helping us.”</p><p>Lilia sighed again, the sound weary. “You’re welcome. But don’t mistake my help for forgiveness. This is going to be an uphill battle, and I expect you both to follow my lead. For now you just keep going on with your lives until I get the appropriate warrants issued. Understood?”</p><p>“Understood,” Agatha and Rio said in unison.</p><p>As the call ended, Agatha let out a long breath, her hands falling to her sides. She turned to Rio, who gave her a small, tentative smile.</p><p>“We’ll figure this out,” Rio said softly. “Together.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her resolve hardening. “We don’t have a choice. This is our fight now, and we’re not backing down.”</p><p>Rio reached for her hand, squeezing it tightly. “Whatever it takes.”</p><p>Agatha met her gaze, her determination mirrored in Rio’s eyes. Whatever Evanora threw at them next, they would face it together—prepared for the war that lay ahead.</p>

<p>The front door burst open with a flourish, and Billy practically bounded into the apartment, bags of clothes in one hand and an ice cream cone in the other. His face was lit with uncontainable joy, a stark contrast to the hesitant and guarded boy who had first joined their makeshift family.</p><p>“Look at this!” he exclaimed, holding up one of the bags. “Wanda said I could pick whatever I wanted! I got new shoes, jeans, shirts—everything!”</p><p>Wanda followed behind him, carrying a few more bags and smiling warmly. “He earned it,” she said, her tone light but proud. “It was about time he had some proper clothes.”</p><p>Billy plopped onto the couch, ice cream dripping slightly onto his hand as he rambled excitedly about the stores they’d visited and the endless options he’d had. “And then,” he added between bites, “Wanda said I could have ice cream! She even got one too!”</p><p>“Wanda, spoiling him already?” Agatha teased, crossing her arms but smiling at the pair.</p><p>Wanda shrugged, her grin unapologetic. “He deserves it.”</p><p>As Billy continued chattering, Wanda set her bags on the counter and turned to Agatha and Rio. “Alright, listen up,” she said, her voice commanding but playful. “We’ve had a hell of a week, and it’s time we all had a proper night out.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, glancing at Rio, who mirrored her curiosity. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean,” Wanda continued, “we’re going out tonight. A nice restaurant, good food, drinks, the works. My treat.”</p><p>Rio blinked, surprised. “You don’t have to do that, Wanda.”</p><p>“I know I don’t,” Wanda replied, crossing her arms. “But I’m doing it anyway. We all need this. And before you say no, I’ve already texted Jen and Alice to meet us there at seven.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed slightly. “You texted Jen?”</p><p>“Yes, Aggie,” Wanda said, rolling her eyes. “She’s your friend. You could use a little more socializing, and she could probably use a night out too. Same goes for Alice.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, shaking her head. “You really thought of everything, didn’t you?”</p><p>Wanda smirked. “Always do.”</p><p>Billy looked up from his ice cream, his face brightening even further. “Wait, do I get to come too?”</p><p>“Of course, Teen,” Agatha said, ruffling his hair affectionately. “You’re part of the family now.”</p><p>Billy’s smile widened, and he returned to his ice cream with renewed enthusiasm. Wanda clapped her hands together, her excitement infectious. “Alright, people, you’ve got a few hours to get ready. Dress up, look nice, and be ready to leave by 6:30.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, shaking her head. “You really are bossy sometimes, you know that?”</p><p>“Someone has to be,” Wanda shot back, winking. “Now, go get ready. I’ll help Billy figure out his outfit.”</p><p>Rio leaned over to Agatha, whispering with a smirk, “Think she’s trying to take your job as the boss?”</p><p>Agatha snorted, her eyes twinkling with amusement. “She can try.”</p><p>As the group began to scatter—Wanda leading Billy to his room, Rio and Agatha retreating to theirs—the apartment buzzed with a newfound energy. For the first time in days, the weight of their troubles seemed to lift, replaced by the promise of laughter, good food, and a night of carefree enjoyment.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the doorframe of their room, watching Rio rifle through her wardrobe. “Think this will be enough to distract us from everything?” she asked softly.</p><p>Rio glanced back at her, a small smile tugging at her lips. “Maybe not completely,” she admitted. “But it’s a start.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her expression softening. “A start sounds good.”</p><p>Rio stood by her wardrobe, rifling through hangers as she tried to decide what to wear. The hum of activity from the rest of the apartment faded into the background as she focused on the task at hand. She didn’t hear the door creak open, but she felt the shift in the air—the faint hesitation that came with someone stepping into the room uninvited.</p><p>She didn’t need to look up. “What’s wrong, Billy?” she asked, her voice calm but certain. “I know that sigh anywhere.”</p><p>Billy hesitated in the doorway, his hand gripping the edge of the frame. After a moment, he closed the door softly and moved to sit on the edge of the bed. He looked small, his shoulders hunched as he fidgeted with the hem of his shirt.</p><p>“I don’t know,” he said quietly, his voice barely above a whisper. “It’s just...a lot.”</p><p>Rio turned to face him, crossing her arms as she leaned back against the wardrobe. “What’s a lot?”</p><p>Billy glanced at her briefly before dropping his gaze to the floor. “Everything. Wanda. This...place. All of it. It’s too good to be real.”</p><p>Rio walked over, sitting beside him on the bed. She didn’t say anything at first, letting the silence settle between them. Finally, Billy spoke, his voice shaking slightly.</p><p>“Why is Wanda being so nice to me?” he asked, his hands twisting nervously in his lap. “There has to be a catch, right? There always is.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened at the vulnerability in his voice. She reached out, resting a hand on his shoulder. “There’s no catch, Billy.”</p><p>He shook his head, his voice growing louder as his emotions bubbled over. “There’s always a catch, Rio! People don’t just do things like this for no reason. They’re nice to you because they want something, and then...when they don’t get it, they leave.”</p><p>His words hung heavy in the air, the weight of his past experiences casting a shadow over the moment. Rio’s hand tightened slightly on his shoulder, her voice steady as she said, “Not Wanda.”</p><p>Billy looked at her, his eyes glistening with unshed tears. “How do you know? How do you know she’s not just pretending?”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, turning slightly to face him. “Because I’ve seen the way she looks at you, Billy. The way she talks about you. She cares, Teen. Really cares.”</p><p>Billy’s lips trembled, and he looked away. “But why? I’m not...special or anything. I’m just...me.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly, tilting her head. “And that’s enough. It’s more than enough. You don’t have to be anything other than yourself for someone to care about you.”</p><p>Billy hesitated, his voice breaking. “I don’t know if I can believe that.”</p><p>Rio shifted closer, her hand now resting lightly on his back. “I get it. After everything you’ve been through, it’s hard to trust. But Wanda’s different. She’s not trying to use you or trick you. She just wants to be there for you.”</p><p>Billy sniffled, wiping at his eyes with the back of his hand. “What if I mess it up? What if she changes her mind?”</p><p>“You won’t mess it up,” Rio said firmly. “And if you’re brave enough to let her in, I think you’ll see she’s not going anywhere.”</p><p>Billy sat quietly for a moment, his shoulders rising and falling with each shaky breath. Finally, he nodded, though his voice was still uncertain. “Maybe.”</p><p>Rio smiled, giving his back a reassuring pat. “That’s a start.”</p><p>He glanced at her, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his lips. “You think so?”</p><p>“I know so,” Rio replied, standing and heading back to the wardrobe. “Now, help me pick something to wear before Wanda decides to barge in and take over.”</p><p>Billy chuckled softly, his mood lifting slightly as he leaned back on the bed. “Fine. But if you wear anything too fancy, I’m going to call you a snob.”</p><p>Rio laughed, the sound light and genuine. “Deal.”</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The group walked into the quaint Italian restaurant, the warm glow of hanging lights and the scent of garlic and fresh bread welcoming them inside. It wasn’t overly fancy, but it had an air of charm that made it feel special. Wanda led the way, her excitement palpable as she guided them to a cozy table near the window.</p><p>Alice was already seated, scrolling idly through her phone. She looked up when she saw the group, her face breaking into a grin. “You’re late.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled, gesturing to Billy. “Blame him. He couldn’t decide on shoes.”</p><p>Billy pouted as he took his seat. “They all looked good, okay?”</p><p>Agatha smiled as she slid into her chair beside Rio. “Thanks for joining us, Alice.”</p><p>Alice shrugged, her grin teasing. “Like I’d say no to free food.”</p><p>As everyone settled in, the door to the restaurant opened again, and Jen walked in, her stride confident and her outfit perfectly tailored to turn heads. She spotted the table and made her way over, her signature smirk firmly in place.</p><p>“Fashionably late, as always,” Agatha teased as Jen took the seat next to her.</p><p>Jen shrugged, leaning back in her chair. “Wouldn’t be me if I wasn’t.”</p><p>As the waiter came by to take drink orders, Jen leaned toward Agatha, her gaze flicking briefly to Alice, who was animatedly talking to Rio about some recent campus gossip.</p><p>“Remember when you said you’d owe me one?” Jen whispered, her voice low and laced with mischief.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, already suspicious. “Yes...why?”</p><p>Jen’s lips curved into a sly smile. “I found a way for you to repay me. What’s her deal?” She tilted her head slightly toward Alice, her meaning clear.</p><p>Agatha followed her gaze, stifling a laugh. “Alice? She’s...a journalist, a bit of a cynic, and apparently has a talent for lockpicking. Why?”</p><p>Jen’s eyes sparkled with intrigue. “Because she’s hot, that’s why. Come on, Aggie, throw me a bone here.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, biting back a smile. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>Jen shrugged, taking a sip of water as the waiter returned with their drinks. “And you’re my wingwoman tonight. Deal with it.”</p><p>The table quickly filled with laughter and easy conversation as drinks were poured and appetizers arrived. Billy was happily digging into a plate of bruschetta, his enthusiasm infectious, while Wanda recounted a story about one of her film classes that had everyone in stitches.</p><p>Alice leaned over to Agatha at one point, her voice teasing. “Your friend there,” she said, nodding toward Jen, “keeps looking at me. Should I be worried?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, glancing between them. “I’d say flattered, not worried.”</p><p>Alice arched an eyebrow but said nothing, her expression thoughtful as she sipped her wine.</p><p>As the night wore on, the group fell into a rhythm, the stresses of the past week fading into the background. Wanda, ever the host, kept the energy light and lively, while Billy basked in the rare feeling of being surrounded by people who genuinely cared about him.</p><p>Jen, meanwhile, continued to subtly (and not-so-subtly) flirt with Alice, much to Agatha’s quiet amusement. Alice, for her part, seemed equal parts intrigued and amused, her sharp wit matching Jen’s at every turn.</p><p>By the time the main courses arrived, the table was filled with warmth and laughter, a stark contrast to the tension that had weighed on them for so long. For the first time in days, they allowed themselves to simply enjoy the moment.</p><p>As the conversation at the table ebbed and flowed, Rio leaned toward Alice, a mischievous smirk tugging at her lips. “So,” she said, her tone casual but teasing, “are you going to say something to Jen, or are you just going to let her flirt with you all night?”</p><p>Alice blinked, turning to face Rio with a mix of confusion and surprise. “What are you talking about?”</p><p>Rio chuckled, tilting her head toward where Jen was laughing at something Wanda had said. “Jen. She’s been giving you eyes all night, Al. You seriously haven’t noticed?”</p><p>Alice’s brows furrowed, her gaze flicking toward Jen and then back to Rio. “She’s not flirting with me. She’s just...friendly.”</p><p>Rio grinned, shaking her head. “Oblivious, as always.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes, but a faint blush crept up her cheeks. “Whatever,” she muttered, taking a sip of her wine. “I’ll believe it when she says something outright.”</p><p>Alice set her glass down, her expression softening as she looked at Rio. “Anyway, enough about that. How are you holding up? Everything okay with Agatha?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, glancing toward Agatha, who was deep in conversation with Wanda and Billy. She let out a small sigh, her voice quieter as she replied, “As okay as it can be, I guess.”</p><p>Alice frowned, her tone growing more protective. “You seemed pretty wrecked when you came to my dorm. I just want to make sure you’re not holding anything back. You know you can talk to me, right?”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, touched by Alice’s concern. “I know, Al. And I appreciate it. Things have been...intense, but we’re working through it. Agatha’s amazing, really.”</p><p>Alice arched an eyebrow. “Amazing, huh?”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, lowering her voice further as she leaned in. “Yeah. So amazing that I think it’s time to drop the L-bomb.”</p><p>Alice blinked, her surprise evident. “Wait—you’re going to tell her you love her?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her expression a mix of nervousness and excitement. “I’ve felt it for a while now, but everything we’ve been through recently...I can’t hold it in anymore. She deserves to know.”</p><p>Alice studied her for a moment before a slow smile spread across her face. “That’s big, Rio. Are you ready for that?”</p><p>Rio exhaled deeply, her fingers fidgeting with the edge of her napkin. “I think so. I mean, it’s scary, but I can’t imagine not saying it anymore. It’s like it’s bursting out of me.”</p><p>Alice reached over, giving Rio’s hand a reassuring squeeze. “Well, for what it’s worth, I think she’s going to feel the same way. You two are kind of disgustingly perfect together.”</p><p>Rio laughed, the tension in her chest easing slightly. “Thanks, Al. I needed that.”</p><p>Alice smirked, leaning back in her chair. “Just don’t get too sappy on me. I can only handle so much romance in one night.”</p><p>As the group continued their meal, the lighthearted banter and laughter filled the air. Rio glanced toward Agatha, her heart swelling as she watched her talk animatedly with Wanda. The thought of saying those three little words was terrifying, but for the first time, it felt like the right kind of terrifying.</p><p>She caught Alice’s eye from across the table, and Alice gave her a subtle nod of encouragement. Rio smiled back, silently resolving to take the leap—sooner rather than later.</p><p>As the plates were cleared and the waiter returned with the check, the group began gathering their things to leave. The warmth and camaraderie of the evening lingered, but the energy shifted as the night stretched on.</p><p>Jen leaned back in her chair, her signature smirk firmly in place. “So,” she began, her tone casual but loaded with intent, “there’s a bar just a block away. I was thinking of stopping by for a drink. Anyone want to join?”</p><p>Her eyes flicked to Alice, her smirk widening. Alice hesitated, glancing between the others as if searching for an excuse. “I don’t know,” she started, her voice uncertain.</p><p>Agatha interjected, a mischievous smile playing on her lips. “Go, Alice. Jen doesn’t bite. Well, not unless you ask her to.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened slightly as a faint blush crept up her cheeks. “I—uh—okay,” she stammered, finally standing. “Just one drink.”</p><p>Rio nudged her as they walked toward the door, leaning in to whisper, “One drink, huh? Have fun.”</p><p>Alice shot her a mock glare, but a small smile tugged at her lips. As she and Jen disappeared into the night, Agatha chuckled softly, shaking her head.</p><p>The group stepped outside into the cool evening air, the buzz of the city adding a subtle hum to the night. Wanda touched Agatha’s arm lightly, drawing her attention.</p><p>“Hey, can I steal you for a sec?” Wanda asked, her tone softer than usual.</p><p>Agatha frowned slightly but nodded. “Sure. What’s up?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, her gaze flicking between them. “Everything okay?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Wanda said quickly, waving her off. “Just need a quick chat with Aggie. We’ll meet you at the car.”</p><p>Rio hesitated for a moment before nodding. “Alright. Don’t be too long.”</p><p>Wanda led Agatha a few steps away, stopping under the glow of a streetlamp. She crossed her arms, her expression serious but warm as she looked at her best friend.</p><p>“You and Rio,” Wanda began, her voice steady. “I’ve been watching you two all night. The way you smile at each other, the little stolen glances when you think no one’s looking...it’s obvious, Aggie.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her arms crossing defensively. “What’s obvious?”</p><p>“That you’re holding something back,” Wanda said, her tone pointed but gentle. “Maybe you’re scared. Maybe it’s everything that’s happened these past few days. But whatever it is, you’re not letting yourself feel what you’re feeling.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line, her gaze dropping to the ground. “It’s not that simple, Wanda.”</p><p>“Yes, it is,” Wanda insisted, stepping closer. “Rio genuinely cares about you. Anyone can see that. And I know you care about her too.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her throat tightening. “I do,” she admitted quietly. “But what if—”</p><p>“No ‘what ifs,’” Wanda interrupted firmly. “You’ve been through hell, Aggie. You’ve spent so much of your life shutting people out, trying to protect yourself. But Rio? She’s not going to hurt you. She loves you. And you deserve to let yourself be loved, to be appreciated the way you should be.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her chest aching with the weight of Wanda’s words. “You really think I can do this?”</p><p>Wanda smiled softly, placing a hand on Agatha’s shoulder. “I know you can. And I think Rio’s been waiting for you to realize it too.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, her gaze meeting Wanda’s. “Thank you,” she said softly. “For always knowing what to say.”</p><p>Wanda grinned, her usual playfulness returning. “That’s what I’m here for. Now, let’s get back to Rio before she starts thinking we’re plotting against her.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, the sound lighter than it had been in days. “She’d definitely believe that.”</p><p>As they walked back toward the car, Agatha’s mind raced. Wanda’s words echoed in her heart, and for the first time in a long time, she felt a sense of clarity. It was time to let herself be vulnerable, to let herself love—and be loved in return.</p><p>The car was quiet, the hum of the engine and the faint sound of the radio filling the comfortable silence. Billy was in the backseat, half-asleep after his exciting day, while Agatha and Rio sat in the middle row, their hands brushing occasionally but not quite holding.</p><p>Wanda drove with a sense of purpose, her expression calm and unreadable. As they neared Rio and Agatha’s apartment, she slowed but didn’t pull into the usual parking spot.</p><p>Rio frowned, glancing at her. “Uh, Wanda? You missed the parking lot.”</p><p>“I know,” Wanda said nonchalantly, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. “I’m not parking.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, sitting up straighter. “Why not?”</p><p>Wanda glanced at them briefly before returning her focus to the road. “Because tonight, Billy and I are going to my place.”</p><p>Billy stirred in the backseat, his head lifting slightly. “We are?”</p><p>“Yes, we are,” Wanda said firmly, though her tone was light. “I haven’t been home in over a week. I need to make sure everything’s still intact and grab some more clothes for the next few days.”</p><p>Agatha gave Wanda a skeptical look. “Since when are you worried about your place being intact?”</p><p>Wanda smirked, not missing a beat. “Since I decided it was a great excuse to give you two some alone time.”</p><p>Rio blinked, her cheeks flushing slightly. “Wait, what?”</p><p>“Oh, don’t act so surprised,” Wanda teased, pulling the car to a stop in front of their building. “You two have been through a lot, and I figure you deserve a night to yourselves. No teenagers, no distractions—just you.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched into a small smile, though she tried to mask it with mock indignation. “You’re so transparent, Wanda.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Wanda admitted with a shrug, “but I’m also right. So, you’re welcome.”</p><p>Billy, now fully awake, sat up and glanced between Wanda and the others. “You sure this isn’t just your way of ditching us?”</p><p>Wanda laughed, reaching back to ruffle his hair. “You caught me, kid. But seriously, we’re going to my place. You’ll like it—it’s got a giant TV and a couch that’s way comfier than that lumpy one at the apartment.”</p><p>Billy grinned, already sold on the idea. “Okay, fine. But only because of the TV.”</p><p>Wanda shook her head, her smile softening as she turned back to Agatha and Rio. “Have a good night, you two. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, a small smirk tugging at her lips. “That doesn’t narrow it down much.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Wanda shot back with a wink before driving off, leaving Agatha and Rio standing on the curb.</p><p>Agatha watched the car disappear around the corner before turning to Rio. “Well, that was subtle.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, her gaze softening as she looked at Agatha. “You think she’s right?”</p><p>“About needing time alone?” Agatha asked, a small smile playing on her lips. “Probably.”</p><p>Rio extended her hand, her fingers brushing lightly against Agatha’s. “Then let’s make the most of it.”</p><p>Agatha took her hand, the warmth of Rio’s touch grounding her. “Agreed.”</p><p>They headed inside together, the quiet night stretching out before them—a rare moment of peace in the chaos of their lives.<br/><br/>~~~~~</p><p>Wanda unlocked the front door, pushing it open to reveal the quiet interior of her house. The soft click of her heels echoed in the hallway as she stepped inside, flipping on the lights. The warm glow illuminated a cozy yet spacious living room with a large couch, a fireplace, and a few personal touches that made the house feel lived-in.</p><p>Billy followed her inside, his eyes widening as he took in the space. “Whoa,” he breathed, his gaze darting from the high ceilings to the well-decorated walls. “This place is huge.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled, setting her bag down on the table by the door. “It’s not that big. Just a normal house.”</p><p>Billy shook his head, spinning slowly as he tried to take it all in. “Normal? Are you kidding? This house could fit, like, 20 kids.”</p><p>Wanda smiled faintly, leaning against the doorframe. “It’s meant for a family of four.”</p><p>Billy paused, tilting his head as he looked at her. “Then why haven’t we been staying here? I mean, this place is way nicer than the apartment.”</p><p>Wanda hesitated, her smile fading slightly as her gaze drifted to the framed photos on the wall. Most of them were of her and her twin brother Pietro, their parents standing proudly beside them. There was a warmth in those photos, a snapshot of a life long gone.</p><p>“It’s...complicated,” Wanda admitted, her voice soft. She crossed her arms, leaning against the wall as she continued. “I don’t spend much time here. Too many memories.”</p><p>Billy frowned, his eyes following her gaze to the photos. “Memories of your family?”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her expression bittersweet. “Yeah. My parents left me this house when they passed away. It was where we all lived before...before the accident.”</p><p>Billy’s expression softened as he stepped closer. “The accident? Is that when you lost your brother?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Wanda said quietly, her voice laced with pain. “Pietro and I were inseparable. And then in one night, I lost both my parents and he was in critical condition for a while. I was hoping, praying, begging for him to get better.And then...it was just me.”</p><p>Billy shifted uncomfortably, unsure of what to say. Part of him wanted to ask more, to understand the depth of Wanda’s pain, but another part of him knew that pushing too hard might hurt her. He looked around the house again, his voice hesitant. “So...this place just kind of sits here? Empty?”</p><p>Wanda smiled faintly, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “Not completely. I come here sometimes when I need space or to grab things. But most of the time, it feels too big, too quiet. That’s why I stay with Agatha and the others—it feels more...alive.”</p><p>Billy nodded slowly, his gaze dropping to the floor. “I get that.”</p><p>Wanda tilted her head, studying him for a moment before offering a small smile. “Come on, let me show you your room.”</p><p>Wanda led Billy down the hallway, opening a door to reveal a cozy guest room with a neatly made bed and a small desk by the window. Billy stepped inside, his amazement returning as he took in the space.</p><p>“This is for me?” he asked, his voice incredulous.</p><p>“For as long as you want it,” Wanda replied. “Make yourself at home.”</p><p>Billy turned to her, a mix of gratitude and hesitation in his eyes. “Thanks, Wanda. I mean it. This...this is really nice.”</p><p>Wanda smiled warmly, ruffling his hair. “You’re welcome, kiddo"</p><p>As Wanda stepped out to let him get comfortable, Billy lingered in the guest room, his fingers brushing over the bedspread. He glanced out the window at the quiet street, his mind racing. The house felt too perfect, too safe, like something out of a dream he was afraid to wake up from.</p><p>But as he thought about Wanda’s words and the care she had shown him, a small, tentative hope began to bloom. Maybe this wasn’t a dream. Maybe, just maybe, he had finally found a place where he belonged.</p><p>Wanda closed the door to Billy’s room softly, her hand lingering on the doorknob for a moment before she turned to leave. As she made her way down the hall, her steps slowed when she reached another door—a door she hadn’t opened in years.</p><p>It was Pietro’s room.</p><p>Her fingers grazed the worn wood of the doorframe, a mix of hesitation and longing coursing through her. Finally, she pushed the door open, the faint creak echoing in the quiet house.</p><p>The room was exactly as Pietro had left it, frozen in time. Dust clung to the surfaces, the faint smell of old books and fabric lingering in the air. Posters of bands they had both loved adorned the walls, their edges curling with age. </p><p>Wanda walked in slowly, her hand trailing over the desk and shelves, her heart aching with every step. She sat on the edge of the bed, the springs creaking softly beneath her. Her gaze fell to the nightstand, where a small, dusty picture frame sat.</p><p>She picked it up carefully, her fingers brushing away the layer of dust to reveal the photo beneath. It was a picture of their family—their parents standing proudly behind her and Pietro, their arms wrapped around each other. They all looked so happy, so full of life.</p><p>A shaky breath escaped her lips as tears welled in her eyes. She held the frame close to her chest, her voice barely above a whisper. “Hi, Pietro.”</p><p>Wanda looked around the room, her lips trembling as she tried to find the words. “It’s been a while,” she began, her voice unsteady. “I’m sorry I haven’t been in here. It’s just...hard. You know?”</p><p>She glanced down at the photo, her thumb brushing over Pietro’s face. “I miss you,” she admitted, her voice breaking. “Every day. It doesn’t get easier, you know? Everyone says it does, but it doesn’t. I still feel like I’m missing a part of myself.”</p><p>She took a deep breath, steadying herself. “But there’s this kid,” she said, her tone softening. “His name is Billy. He’s...he’s a lot like us, Pietro. He’s been through hell, but he’s still standing. And he’s funny, and smart, and so, so brave.”</p><p>Wanda’s voice grew quieter, more introspective. “I think you’d like him. I think you’d see a bit of yourself in him. And maybe a bit of me too.”</p><p>Tears spilled down her cheeks as she hugged the photo frame tightly. “I’m trying to take care of him, Pietro. To give him what we didn’t have after Mom and Dad were gone. But I’m scared. Scared I’ll mess it up, scared I’ll let him down.”</p><p>Her voice faltered, but she pressed on. “I know you’d tell me to stop overthinking it. That I’d figure it out, like I always do. But it’s hard without you here.”</p><p>Wanda closed her eyes, her grip on the frame tightening. “I’m going to try, though. For him. For me. And for you. I’ll make sure he knows he’s not alone. That he has a family now.”</p><p>She sat there for a while, the silence of the room wrapping around her like a blanket. Finally, she stood, placing the photo frame carefully back on the nightstand. She looked around the room one last time, her hand resting on the doorframe as she whispered, “I love you, Pietro. Always.”</p><p>With that, Wanda walked to the door. The heaviness in her chest remained, but for the first time in a long time, there was a small flicker of hope. A promise to herself—and to Pietro—that she would keep moving forward.<br/><br/>~~~~~</p><p>Billy stepped out of his room cautiously, rubbing his eyes as he tried to orient himself in the unfamiliar house. The hallway seemed longer in the dim light, and he wasn’t entirely sure where the bathroom was.</p><p>He wandered down the hall, pausing when he heard a voice—Wanda’s voice—coming from a slightly ajar door. He froze, recognizing the raw emotion in her tone.</p><p>“I’m trying to take care of him, Pietro,” she was saying, her voice thick with unshed tears. “To give him what we didn’t have after Mom and Dad were gone. But I’m scared. Scared I’ll mess it up, scared I’ll let him down.”</p><p>Billy’s heart clenched at her words. He knew she was talking about him, and part of him wanted to step forward, to tell her she wasn’t messing up. But the moment felt too private, too sacred, and he couldn’t bring himself to interrupt.</p><p>As he turned to leave, he heard the door creak open. Wanda stepped out, her eyes red but resolute, and almost bumped into him.</p><p>“Billy?” she said, startled.</p><p>Billy’s breath hitched, panic flashing across his face. “I—I’m sorry!” he stammered, taking a step back. “I was just...I was trying to find the bathroom, and I got lost, and I didn’t mean to overhear anything, I swear!”</p><p>Wanda’s brows furrowed, confused by his sudden anxiety. “It’s okay, Billy. You don’t have to—”</p><p>“I’m sorry!” he repeated, his voice rising as he continued to back away. His shoulders hit the wall, and his eyes darted around, looking for an escape. His fists clenched at his sides, his breathing quickening as if he were cornered.</p><p>Wanda’s heart sank as she recognized the fear in his eyes. He wasn’t just scared—he was terrified, like a trapped animal ready to bolt at the first opportunity.</p><p>“Hey,” Wanda said softly, holding up her hands in a gesture of peace. She took a careful step forward, keeping her voice calm and steady. “Billy, it’s okay. I’m not mad. You’re not in trouble.”</p><p>Billy pressed himself harder against the wall, his fists trembling. “I didn’t mean to listen! I wasn’t spying, I swear! Please don’t—”</p><p>“Billy,” Wanda interrupted gently, cutting through his panicked words. “It’s okay. I believe you.”</p><p>Her voice was so soft, so kind, that Billy hesitated, his breath hitching as he glanced up at her. She took another step closer, her hands still raised. “I’m not going to yell at you. I’m not going to hurt you. You don’t have to be scared.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes darted between her and the hallway, his body still tense but his breathing beginning to slow. “You’re...not mad?”</p><p>Wanda shook her head, her expression earnest. “Not even a little. You were just trying to find the bathroom, right?”</p><p>Billy nodded hesitantly, his fists unclenching slightly. “Yeah.”</p><p>“Okay,” Wanda said with a small smile. “Come here.” She held out her hand, not forcing him but offering him a choice. “You’re safe, Billy. I promise.”</p><p>Billy hesitated, his body still coiled tight with tension. But there was something in Wanda’s voice, in her steady gaze, that made him take a shaky step forward. Then another. Finally, he reached out and took her hand, his fingers trembling against hers.</p><p>Wanda gave his hand a gentle squeeze, her voice soothing. “See? Nothing to be afraid of.”</p><p>Billy swallowed hard, his voice barely above a whisper. “I thought...I thought you were going to be mad. Or yell. Or...worse.”</p><p>Wanda’s heart broke at his words. She knelt down slightly to meet his eyes, her tone firm but filled with warmth. “No one’s ever going to hurt you here, Billy. Not me, not Agatha, not Rio. You’re safe with us.”</p><p>Billy’s lip quivered, his walls crumbling as tears filled his eyes. “You mean it?”</p><p>“I mean it,” Wanda said, pulling him into a gentle hug. “I promise.”</p><p>Billy clung to her, his small frame shaking as he let out a choked sob. Wanda held him tightly, her hand rubbing soothing circles on his back. “It’s okay,” she murmured. “You’re okay.”</p><p>After a moment, he pulled back slightly, wiping at his face with his sleeve. “Sorry,” he muttered, his voice shaky.</p><p>Wanda smiled softly, brushing a strand of hair from his forehead. “Don’t apologize. You didn’t do anything wrong.”</p><p>Billy sniffled, looking down at the floor. “I heard what you said...to your brother.”</p><p>Wanda froze for a moment, her chest tightening. “You did?”</p><p>He nodded, glancing up at her. “I just...wanted to say...you’re not messing up. You’re doing good.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes filled with tears, but she blinked them back, her smile widening. “Thank you, Billy. That means more than you know.”</p><p>Billy nodded again, his fear replaced by a tentative sense of comfort. “Can you...show me the bathroom now?”</p><p>Wanda laughed softly, standing and ruffling his hair. “Come on, kiddo. It’s this way.”</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Wanda sat in her study, her laptop balanced on her knees as she reviewed notes for an upcoming project. The quiet of the house pressed in around her, a stark contrast to the bustling energy of the apartment she had shared with Agatha, Rio, and Billy.</p><p>A soft knock broke the silence. She looked up, surprised. “Come in.”</p><p>The door opened slowly, and Billy peeked in, his expression tentative. “Hey,” he said softly. “I was just...um...can I sit with you for a while? I promise I’ll be quiet.”</p><p>Wanda set her laptop aside, her smile warm. “Of course, kiddo. Come on in.”</p><p>Billy stepped inside, closing the door behind him. He made his way to the couch in the corner, settling into the plush cushions. “It’s just...the house is too new, you know? It always takes a while to adjust to new places, like with foster homes. But being here, with you...it helps.”</p><p>Wanda’s heart clenched at his words. “I’m glad I can help,” she said softly, her tone sincere.</p><p>For a while, they sat in companionable silence. Wanda returned to her notes, while Billy gazed out the window, his hands fidgeting with the hem of his shirt. After some time, Wanda glanced at him, her voice gentle.</p><p>“Billy,” she began, “can I ask you something?”</p><p>He nodded, his gaze still focused on the window. “Sure.”</p><p>“Why did you run away from your foster parents that night?” Wanda asked carefully. “What happened?”</p><p>Billy stiffened slightly, his fingers tightening around his shirt. “I...I don’t know if I can say it.”</p><p>Wanda set her laptop aside again, giving him her full attention. “You don’t have to tell me if you’re not ready,” she said. “But I want you to know that no matter what it is, I’ve got your back. Always.”</p><p>Billy hesitated, his breathing unsteady as he stared down at his hands. “It’s just...if I say it out loud, what if you hate me?”</p><p>Wanda’s chest ached at the vulnerability in his voice. She leaned forward, her tone firm but kind. “Billy, look at me.”</p><p>He glanced up, his eyes filled with fear and uncertainty.</p><p>“I could never hate you,” Wanda said. “You’re part of this family now, and nothing you say is going to change that. I promise.”</p><p>Billy took a shaky breath, his voice barely above a whisper. “My foster dad...he caught me making out with a guy. Eddie. We were on the porch, and he saw us.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression softened, but she remained silent, letting him continue.</p><p>“He was drunk,” Billy said, his voice breaking. “And he dragged me into the house. He said he was going to ‘beat the gay out of me.’ But I managed to get away. I ran...and I just kept running until I found Rio.”</p><p>Billy’s words hung in the air, heavy with the weight of his confession. He looked at Wanda nervously, his hands clenched into fists as he prepared for the worst.</p><p>To his surprise, Wanda laughed softly.</p><p>Billy blinked, confused. “Why are you laughing?”</p><p>Wanda shook her head, her smile growing. “Because you looked so scared to tell me, like you thought I was going to be upset or shocked. But, Billy, have you met our little family? No one here is straight.”</p><p>Billy stared at her, his confusion giving way to a small, tentative smile. “Wait...really?”</p><p>“Really,” Wanda said with a grin. “You’re not exactly ‘coming out’ to me, kiddo. You’re just...joining the club.”</p><p>Billy let out a small laugh, relief washing over him as his body relaxed. “So you’re not mad?”</p><p>“Mad?” Wanda scoffed. “Of course not. I’m proud of you, Billy. For being brave enough to tell me, and for standing up for yourself, even in the face of...that.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes filled with tears, but this time they were tears of relief. “Thanks, Wanda.”</p><p>She reached over, pulling him into a hug. “You’re welcome, kiddo. And remember, no matter what, you’re never alone. Not anymore.”</p><p>As they pulled apart, Wanda ruffled his hair affectionately. “Now, how about some hot chocolate? It’s the least I can do after such a big moment.”</p><p>Billy smiled, his cheeks still wet with tears. “That sounds good.”</p><p>Wanda stood, leading him toward the kitchen. As they walked, Billy glanced at her, his voice soft but filled with gratitude. “You’re the best, you know that?”</p><p>Wanda laughed, nudging him gently. “I know.”</p><p>For the first time in a long time, Billy felt truly seen—and truly safe.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Billy was curled up on the couch in Wanda’s study, his eyes lazily following her as she worked. He rested his chin on his knees, looking deep in thought. After a few moments, he broke the silence.</p><p>“Wanda?” he asked hesitantly.</p><p>She glanced up from her notes, setting her pen down. “What’s up, kiddo?”</p><p>Billy hesitated, his fingers fidgeting with the hem of his shirt. “If...if you adopt me, do I have to change my last name?”</p><p>Wanda blinked, surprised by the question. “No, of course not. That’s entirely up to you.”</p><p>Billy nodded, looking thoughtful. “I’ve just...I’ve always been William Kaplan. I mean, it’s what I’m used to, you know? But...Billy Maximoff.” He said the name slowly, like he was trying it on for size. A small smile tugged at his lips. “It has a nice ring to it.”</p><p>Wanda’s heart swelled, and she leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees. “It does,” she agreed softly. “But it’s your name, Billy. You get to choose what feels right for you.”</p><p>Billy looked up at her, his smile widening. “I’ll think about it. Promise.”</p><p>Billy stretched out on the couch, laying down as he continued to watch Wanda work. The soft scratching of her pen and the quiet hum of the lamp made the room feel cozy, almost hypnotic. His eyelids grew heavier, and he yawned, curling up into a ball.</p><p>Wanda glanced over at him, shaking her head with a faint smile. “You know, there’s a perfectly good bed just down the hall.”</p><p>Billy mumbled something incoherent, already halfway to sleep. Wanda chuckled softly, pushing her chair back as she stood. She walked over to him, grabbing a blanket from the armrest and draping it over his curled-up form.</p><p>As she tucked the blanket around him, he stirred slightly, a sleepy murmur escaping his lips. “Thanks, Mom,” he whispered, his voice soft and dreamy.</p><p>Wanda froze for a moment, her heart catching in her chest. The word—so simple, yet so profound—washed over her like a wave. A warm, loving smile spread across her face as she leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead.</p><p>“Goodnight, Billy,” she whispered, her voice tender.</p><p>Wanda returned to her desk, her mind drifting as she tried to focus on her notes. But her gaze kept shifting back to the couch, where Billy slept peacefully, his face relaxed and content.</p><p>She didn’t need to hear his decision about the last name. Whether he stayed William Kaplan or became Billy Maximoff didn’t matter to her. What mattered was that he was here, safe and loved—and finally, he was starting to believe it.</p><p>With a quiet sigh of contentment, Wanda returned to her work, the warmth of the moment lingering in the room.</p>

<p>Agatha watched the car disappear around the corner before turning to Rio. “Well, that was subtle.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, her gaze softening as she looked at Agatha. “You think she’s right?”</p><p>“About needing time alone?” Agatha asked, a small smile playing on her lips. “Probably.”</p><p>Rio extended her hand, her fingers brushing lightly against Agatha’s. “Then let’s make the most of it.”</p><p>Agatha took her hand, the warmth of Rio’s touch grounding her. “Agreed.”</p><p>They headed inside together, the quiet night stretching out before them—a rare moment of peace in the chaos of their lives.</p><p>Agatha kicked off her shoes the moment they entered the apartment, sighing with relief as she stretched. Rio followed behind, leaning against the doorframe with a small smile. The evening had been long, but the warmth of being alone together now felt like a balm after everything they had endured.</p><p>“I think I’m going to take a shower,” Agatha announced, running a hand through her hair. “Want to join me?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened slightly, a faint blush creeping up her cheeks. She cleared her throat, glancing away. “Uh, I would, but...I’ve got something to do.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips twitching into a smirk. “Something to do? Like what?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her mind racing for an excuse. “Like...uh...checking emails. Really important emails.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, her smirk widening. “Emails? At this hour?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio replied quickly, her voice a bit too high-pitched. “Super important. You know how it is.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, shaking her head. “Alright, fine. But you’re not fooling me, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio grinned sheepishly, watching as Agatha disappeared into the bathroom. The sound of the shower turning on filled the apartment, and Rio exhaled deeply, her smile fading into a determined expression.</p><p>“Alright,” she muttered to herself. “Time to set the mood.”</p><p>Rio moved quickly, grabbing a box of candles she had stashed in the kitchen cabinet. She hadn’t planned for this exactly, but she always kept a few emergency “romantic” items on hand—just in case. She lit each candle carefully, placing them around Agatha’s bedroom, the warm flickering light casting soft shadows across the walls.</p><p>Next, she adjusted the bedding, fluffing the pillows and smoothing out the duvet. She grabbed her phone, selecting a playlist of soft, romantic songs and setting it to play at a low volume.</p><p>The room transformed into a cozy, intimate haven, and Rio stood back to admire her work. She smiled to herself, imagining Agatha’s reaction. The thought made her heart race with equal parts excitement and nerves.</p><p>The flickering candlelight cast a soft, warm glow across Agatha’s bedroom, dancing on the walls and highlighting the gentle curves of Rio’s face as she stood in the middle of the room. Agatha, fresh from her shower, paused in the doorway, her damp hair curling against her shoulders and a towel wrapped securely around her.</p><p>Her eyes scanned the room, taking in the thoughtful arrangement Rio had created—the candles, the neatly made bed, and the faint sound of soft music playing in the background. She blinked, her heart fluttering as she stepped inside. “Rio...did you do all this?”</p><p>Rio smiled, a little shyly, and nodded. “Yeah. I just...wanted to do something special for you.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched into a smile, her voice soft. “This is more than special. It’s perfect.”</p><p>Rio gestured toward the bed, and Agatha moved to sit, the towel shifting slightly as she adjusted herself. Rio sat beside her, their knees brushing as they settled into the quiet intimacy of the moment.</p><p>For a while, neither spoke. The silence wasn’t uncomfortable, but it was thick with unspoken words, the air charged with anticipation. Rio fidgeted with her hands, her gaze focused on the floor.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, studying her. “You’ve got that look,” she said gently. “What’s on your mind?”</p><p>Rio let out a shaky laugh, glancing up at her. “I’m not great with words, you know that.”</p><p>“True,” Agatha said with a teasing smile, her voice light. “But I think you’re better at it than you give yourself credit for.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, her eyes locking onto Agatha’s. “Okay, here goes.”</p><p>“I love you, Agatha,” Rio said, her voice steady despite the rapid thudding of her heart. “I’ve loved you for a while now. But after everything we’ve been through, I just...I can’t keep it in anymore. You need to know.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, her eyes widening slightly. The weight of Rio’s words, so simple yet profound, settled over her like a warm blanket. She opened her mouth to respond but faltered, the emotion choking her words.</p><p>“I mean it,” Rio continued, her gaze unwavering. “You’re the most incredible person I’ve ever met. You’re strong and smart and—” she hesitated, her lips curving into a soft smile. “You make me want to be better. For you.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, though tears shimmered in her eyes. She reached out, her hand cupping Rio’s cheek as her thumb brushed over her skin. “You know, for someone who says they’re not great with words, you sure know how to hit me where it counts.”</p><p>Rio smirked, leaning slightly into her touch. “So...what are you thinking?”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, her voice trembling but certain. “I love you, too.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, her lips parting in surprise. “You do?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, a tear slipping down her cheek as she smiled. “I do. And I have for a while. I was just too scared to say it. Too scared of losing you, or not being enough.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, brushing the tear away with her thumb. “You’re more than enough, Agatha. You’re everything.”</p><p>Agatha laughed again, the sound a mix of relief and joy. “You really are impossible, you know that?”</p><p>“And you love me for it,” Rio teased, leaning in closer.</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond with words. Instead, she closed the distance between them, capturing Rio’s lips in a kiss that was slow, passionate, and filled with every ounce of emotion she hadn’t been able to express until now.</p><p>When they finally pulled apart, their foreheads rested together, their breaths mingling in the stillness of the room. Agatha smiled, her voice barely above a whisper. “I guess this is it, huh? No turning back now.”</p><p>Rio grinned, her eyes sparkling. “Wouldn’t want to.”</p><p>They stayed like that for a while, holding each other as the candles flickered around them. The rest of the world faded away, leaving only the warmth of their love and the quiet promise of a future they would face together—no matter what.</p><p>For the first time in a long time, they felt whole.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The first rays of sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow over the room. Agatha stirred, her body instinctively curling closer to the warmth beside her. It took a moment for her to register the steady rise and fall of Rio’s chest beneath her cheek and the protective arm draped over her waist.</p><p>Her lips curved into a soft smile as the memories of the previous night came flooding back. She lifted her head slightly, taking in the peaceful expression on Rio’s face, her normally sharp features softened in sleep. It was rare to see her so still, so unguarded.</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly to herself, brushing a stray curl from Rio’s forehead. “You’re trouble, you know that?” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered open at the sound of Agatha’s voice, her sleepy smile growing as she took in the sight of her. “Good morning to you, too, bossy pants,” she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, feigning offense. “Bossy? Is that any way to greet the woman who just confessed her love to you?”</p><p>Rio smirked, her voice laced with teasing. “It’s the perfect way, actually. Keeps you on your toes.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her smile didn’t waver. She settled back against Rio’s chest, the steady rhythm of her heartbeat grounding her. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>“And you love me for it,” Rio replied, her tone light but sincere.</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond right away, her smile softening as she let the moment stretch out between them. “I really do,” she admitted finally, her voice barely audible. “I think I’ve known it for a while.”</p><p>Rio’s teasing expression shifted to something more tender as she tightened her hold on Agatha. “I’ve known it, too,” she said quietly. “But hearing you say it...that’s something else.”</p><p>Agatha lifted her head, propping herself up on one elbow as she looked down at Rio. “So, what now?” she asked, her tone serious but curious. “What happens next for...us?”</p><p>Rio smiled, reaching up to tuck a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear. “We keep going,” she said simply. “We figure it out as we go, like we always do.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, her gaze drifting toward the window. “It feels...big. Like everything is changing.”</p><p>“It is,” Rio agreed, her hand brushing lightly against Agatha’s arm. “But change isn’t always bad, Aggie. Sometimes it’s exactly what we need.”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, a knock sounded at the door, followed by Wanda’s familiar voice. “Good morning, lovebirds! Get up and put some clothes on! Billy and I are coming in!”</p><p>Agatha groaned, burying her face in Rio’s shoulder. “Is she serious right now?”</p><p>Rio laughed, her chest shaking beneath Agatha. “Always.”</p><p>“Don’t make me come in there!” Wanda called out again, her tone more playful than threatening.</p><p>“Five minutes, Wanda!” Agatha shouted back, her voice muffled against Rio. She lifted her head, giving Rio a mock glare. “Your bad influence is rubbing off on her.”</p><p>Rio grinned, leaning up to press a kiss to Agatha’s temple. “You wouldn’t have it any other way.”</p><p>Eventually, they untangled themselves from the warmth of the bed, reluctantly stepping into the day. As Agatha dressed, she stole glances at Rio, her heart swelling with a mix of affection and anticipation. For all the chaos that surrounded them, this moment felt like a beacon of calm—a promise of what could be.</p><p>When they finally emerged from the bedroom, Wanda and Billy were already in the kitchen. Wanda raised an eyebrow, her lips twitching into a smirk. “Took you long enough.”</p><p>Billy looked up from his cereal, his face scrunching in mock horror. “I’m just going to pretend you two were reading or something.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the smile on her face betrayed her amusement. “Yes, Billy, we were reading.”</p><p>Rio nudged her playfully, leaning down to whisper, “Technically not a lie. We’re writing our own love story.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, shaking her head. “You’re ridiculous.”</p><p>“And you love me for it,” Rio replied smoothly.</p><p>Agatha didn’t deny it. She just grabbed a cup of coffee and joined her chaotic little family, ready to face whatever came next.</p><p>The kitchen buzzed with a comfortable energy as everyone moved about. Wanda flipped pancakes at the stove, humming a tune under her breath, while Billy eagerly set the table, occasionally sneaking a piece of fruit from the bowl in the center.</p><p>Agatha and Rio leaned against the counter, sipping their coffee and watching the organized chaos unfold.</p><p>“You’ve got quite the system going here,” Rio remarked, gesturing toward Wanda’s efficient pancake flipping.</p><p>“She runs a tight ship,” Agatha said with a smirk. “Don’t let her fool you—she’s the real boss.”</p><p>Wanda glanced over her shoulder, raising an eyebrow. “Damn right I am. Now, stop slacking and grab the syrup.”</p><p>Rio laughed, pushing off the counter to comply, and Agatha followed her with an amused shake of her head.</p><p>As they all sat down to eat, the table filled with the sound of clinking cutlery and cheerful chatter. Billy was the most animated, recounting the latest episode of his favorite show in great detail, complete with sound effects and dramatic reenactments.</p><p>Rio grinned, nudging Agatha. “Think he missed his calling as an actor?”</p><p>“Or a stand-up comedian,” Agatha replied, chuckling as Billy threw in an over-the-top villain laugh for emphasis.</p><p>Wanda smiled fondly, watching Billy’s antics. “He’s got a flair for storytelling, that’s for sure.”</p><p>Billy beamed, his enthusiasm infectious. “Maybe I’ll be a director like you, Wanda. Or a journalist like Rio. Or...I don’t know, something cool.”</p><p>“Kid, you’re already cool,” Rio said with a wink, earning a proud grin from Billy.</p><p>After breakfast, the group began cleaning up, each person taking a task. Rio and Agatha found themselves drying dishes together, the quiet moment giving them a chance to talk.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, her voice low enough to keep their conversation private. “How do you feel about...all of this? Us. The...family dynamic.”</p><p>Agatha paused, her hands stilling on the dish in her hand. “I feel...good,” she admitted. “Better than I have in a long time, actually.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, her gaze soft. “Good enough to believe it’s real?”</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly, glancing toward Wanda and Billy, who were playfully arguing over who had used more syrup. “Yeah,” she said quietly. “Good enough to believe it’s real.”</p><p>Rio reached over, brushing her fingers against Agatha’s hand. “Good. Because I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile widened, and she gave Rio’s hand a quick squeeze. “Neither am I.”</p><p>Once the kitchen was clean, everyone gathered in the living room. Wanda plopped down on the couch, stretching her arms over her head. “Alright, team. What’s the plan for today?”</p><p>Billy immediately perked up. “Can we go to the park? Or maybe the arcade? Or—oh! What about the zoo?”</p><p>Rio laughed, leaning back in her chair. “Ambitious, aren’t we?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “And here I thought I was the bossy one.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes but smiled. “Let’s vote. Park? Arcade? Zoo?”</p><p>Billy raised his hand for the zoo, while Rio and Wanda voted for the park. Agatha shrugged. “Park it is.”</p><p>“Fine,” Billy said with a mock pout. “But only if we get ice cream after.”</p><p>“Deal,” Wanda said, ruffling his hair. “Now go get ready.”</p><p>As Billy dashed off to grab his shoes, Wanda turned to Agatha and Rio. “Thanks for indulging him,” she said, her voice quieter. “I think he’s starting to feel...safe.”</p><p>“He’s a good kid,” Rio said, her tone soft. “And he’s lucky to have you.”</p><p>Wanda smiled, her eyes briefly shimmering with emotion before she turned away. “Alright, let’s get moving. We’ve got a park to conquer.”</p><p>Agatha and Rio exchanged a look, their smiles matching as they followed Wanda to the door. The morning had been simple, but it was moments like these that reminded them of what they were fighting for—a sense of belonging, of family, of love.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The park was alive with the sounds of children laughing, dogs barking, and the gentle rustle of trees in the breeze. Wanda parked the car, and Billy was the first to hop out, his excitement palpable as he scanned the sprawling green space.</p><p>“This place is huge!” Billy exclaimed, turning to Wanda with wide eyes. “Are we gonna do everything? The playground, the trail, the pond?”</p><p>Wanda chuckled, grabbing a blanket and a basket from the trunk. “One thing at a time, Teen. Let’s find a good spot first.”</p><p>Agatha and Rio trailed behind, holding hands discreetly as they followed Wanda and Billy. Agatha squinted at the activity in the park. “There are a lot of kids here. You sure we won’t lose him in the chaos?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “He’s loud enough. We’ll hear him if he gets lost.”</p><p>They found a shady spot under a large oak tree, not far from the playground. Wanda spread out the blanket while Billy eagerly rummaged through the basket to see what snacks they’d brought.</p><p>“Fruit, sandwiches, juice...” Billy listed off, then paused, holding up a small thermos. “What’s this?”</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “That’s coffee for me. No touchy.”</p><p>Billy rolled his eyes dramatically, setting it back in the basket. “Fine. But if I fall asleep mid-playground, it’s on you.”</p><p>Rio laughed, nudging Agatha. “He’s got your sass.”</p><p>“Don’t remind me,” Agatha replied dryly, though the corner of her mouth twitched with amusement.</p><p>Billy didn’t waste any time. As soon as they were settled, he dashed toward the playground, shouting over his shoulder, “I’m going to the swings!”</p><p>Wanda watched him go, her expression softening. “He’s like a kid who finally found Christmas.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, sitting cross-legged on the blanket. “He deserves this. Just a day to be...normal.”</p><p>Rio leaned back on her hands, watching Billy pump his legs on the swing. “It’s a start.”</p><p>Wanda turned to Rio with a smirk. “How about you, Ms. Chaotic? Up for a turn on the monkey bars?”</p><p>Rio snorted. “Pass. I’d probably fall and embarrass myself.”</p><p>“I’d pay to see that,” Agatha quipped, earning a playful shove from Rio.</p><p>After a while, Billy returned, dragging Wanda toward the pond. “Come on, let’s look for ducks!”</p><p>Wanda shot a glance at Agatha and Rio. “You two coming?”</p><p>Agatha waved her off. “Go ahead. We’ll hold down the fort.”</p><p>Rio leaned over as Wanda and Billy walked away, whispering, “Translation: ‘We’re too lazy to move.’”</p><p>“Exactly,” Agatha replied with a grin.</p><p>They watched Wanda and Billy from a distance, their laughter carrying on the breeze. Agatha sighed, her expression softening. “She’s good with him.”</p><p>“She’s good, period,” Rio said. “Billy’s lucky to have her.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio, a small smile tugging at her lips. “We’re all lucky to have each other.”</p><p>After their stroll around the pond, the group reconvened under the tree. Wanda handed out sandwiches while Billy regaled them with stories of his “duck adventures.”</p><p>“I think one of them liked me,” he said seriously. “He kept quacking in my direction.”</p><p>“That’s true love, Teen,” Rio teased, earning a laugh from Billy.</p><p>As the day wore on, they treated themselves to ice cream from a nearby stand. Billy chose the biggest cone available, his face lighting up as he tried to eat it before it melted. Wanda watched him with a fond smile, her heart full.</p><p>Agatha turned to Rio, her voice soft. “This is nice.”</p><p>Rio nodded, slipping her hand into Agatha’s. “Yeah. It really is.”</p><p>As the sun began to set, painting the park in hues of orange and pink, the group started packing up. Billy was the last to leave the playground, reluctantly dragging his feet as Wanda called him over.</p><p>“Do we have to go?” he asked, his tone wistful.</p><p>Wanda ruffled his hair. “We’ll come back. Promise.”</p><p>Billy brightened at that, nodding as he climbed into the car. The drive home was quieter, the day’s adventures catching up with everyone. Billy fell asleep halfway there, his head resting against the window, a small smile on his face.</p><p>Agatha and Rio exchanged a look in the backseat, their fingers entwined. For the first time in a while, it felt like things were falling into place.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p><br/>The apartment was quiet when they returned, the day’s adventures leaving everyone pleasantly tired. Wanda carried the leftover snacks from the picnic into the kitchen, while Rio helped Billy take off his shoes. Agatha tossed her keys onto the counter, stretching her arms with a satisfied sigh.</p><p>Billy, still buzzing with energy despite the long day, plopped onto the couch, kicking his legs against the edge. “Today was awesome,” he declared, grinning at the others. “We should go to the park every weekend!”</p><p>Rio smirked, ruffling his hair as she passed. “You’re ambitious, Billy.”</p><p>“I try,” Billy replied with a playful shrug.</p><p>After dinner, Billy was sitting cross-legged on the floor, flipping through a magazine he’d found in Wanda’s study. It was an old issue featuring an article about adopting pets, and his eyes lit up as he stared at the pictures of puppies, kittens, and even a turtle.</p><p>“Hey, Wanda?” he called, holding up the magazine.</p><p>Wanda glanced over from the kitchen, where she was making tea. “What’s up, Billy?”</p><p>Billy grinned, waving the magazine. “Do you think...maybe someday...we could get a pet?”</p><p>Wanda froze for a moment, surprised by the question. She set down her mug and walked over, taking the magazine from him. “A pet, huh?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Billy said enthusiastically. “Like a dog or a cat—or even a turtle! I’d take care of it, I promise. Feed it, walk it, whatever it needs.”</p><p>Agatha, sitting on the couch with Rio, raised an eyebrow. “You realize a pet is a lot of responsibility, right? It’s not just playing fetch and cuddling.”</p><p>Billy nodded earnestly. “I know! But I could do it. And it’d be nice, wouldn’t it? To have a little...I don’t know, mascot for the family?”</p><p>Wanda sat down beside Billy, flipping through the magazine absently. “It’s not a bad idea,” she said carefully, “but it’s also a big decision. Pets aren’t just for fun—they’re a lifetime commitment.”</p><p>Billy’s expression faltered slightly, and he looked down. “Yeah, I know. It’s just...it might be nice to have something here that’s always happy to see us. Something...consistent.”</p><p>The room grew quiet at his words, and Wanda’s heart ached at the vulnerability in his tone. She reached out, squeezing his shoulder. “It’s not a no, Billy. It’s a maybe. How about we talk about it again in a few weeks, once things have settled a bit?”</p><p>Billy brightened at that, a hopeful smile returning to his face. “Really? You mean it?”</p><p>Wanda smiled, ruffling his hair. “I mean it.”</p><p>Later that evening, after Billy had gone to bed, Wanda sat at the table with Agatha and Rio, nursing a glass of wine. She leaned back in her chair, exhaling deeply. “So...Billy wants a pet.”</p><p>Rio smirked, swirling her wine. “He’s not wrong. It might be nice to have a mascot.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “You’re seriously considering it?”</p><p>Wanda shrugged, her expression thoughtful. “Maybe. I mean, it’s a big responsibility, but...I get why he wants it. After everything he’s been through, having something stable, something constant...I think it’d help.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her gaze softening. “It would be good for him. But it’d also be good for you.”</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “Me?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, grinning. “We all know you’d spoil the thing rotten.”</p><p>Wanda laughed, shaking her head. “Maybe. But only if you two promise to help.”</p><p>Rio raised her glass in a mock toast. “Deal.”</p><p>The next morning, Billy woke up to the smell of breakfast wafting through the apartment. He stumbled into the kitchen, his hair sticking up in every direction, and found Wanda flipping pancakes.</p><p>“Morning, Teen,” she said with a smile.</p><p>Billy rubbed his eyes. “Morning. What’s all this for?”</p><p>Wanda set a plate of pancakes in front of him, her smile soft. “Just felt like celebrating. And I wanted to let you know...we’ll talk more about the pet idea soon. But for now, let’s focus on making this place feel like home.”</p><p>Billy grinned, his eyes shining with excitement. “Thanks, Wanda.”</p><p>She leaned down, pressing a kiss to his temple. “Anything for you, kiddo.”</p><p>It seemed to be a quiet morning in the apartment, with Billy working on homework, Wanda making notes for an upcoming project, and Agatha and Rio lingering over coffee. The peaceful atmosphere was broken when the mail arrived, a thick envelope addressed to Agatha catching her attention.</p><p>Agatha picked it up, her brow furrowing as she studied the university’s seal on the front. “This can’t be good,” she murmured, tearing it open.</p><p>The others watched as she scanned the letter, her face paling. She set the letter on the table, her hands trembling slightly.</p><p>“What is it?” Rio asked, concern etched on her face.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, her voice tight. “The university is reviewing my scholarship. Apparently, they’ve received complaints about...unethical behavior.”</p><p>Wanda frowned, walking over to read the letter herself. “What kind of complaints?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “The kind that scream Evanora.”</p><p>As Agatha explained the situation, Rio’s phone buzzed on the counter. She picked it up, frowning at the unknown number. When she answered, a deep voice on the other end introduced himself as the university’s dean of student affairs.</p><p>“Miss Vidal,” the voice said. “I regret to inform you that your scholarship is also under review. There have been allegations of criminal activity tied to your recent legal troubles.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped, and she gripped the edge of the counter to steady herself. “Allegations? What kind of allegations?”</p><p>“Breaking and entering, among other things,” the dean replied. “We’ll need to discuss this further, but for now, your funding is temporarily suspended.”</p><p>Rio hung up, her hands shaking as she relayed the news to the group. The atmosphere in the room grew heavy, the weight of Evanora’s reach pressing down on all of them.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Later that day, they gathered in the living room to video call Lilia Calderu. The criminal law professor appeared on the screen, her expression grim as she listened to Agatha and Rio explain the situation.</p><p>“This is serious,” Lilia said, her tone firm. “Evanora is playing a long game, and she’s clearly pulling every string she can to ruin you both.”</p><p>“What can we do?” Agatha asked, frustration simmering beneath her calm facade.</p><p>Lilia sighed, leaning forward. “First, we fight the allegations head-on. Agatha, we’ll need to gather evidence proving your academic integrity. And Rio, we’ll need to show that the accusations against you are baseless.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “And what about Evanora? She’s the root of all this.”</p><p>Lilia’s expression hardened. “For now, we focus on clearing your names. But rest assured, I’ll be looking into ways to expose Evanora’s actions. She’s not invincible.”</p><p>The following days were tense as the group worked together to gather evidence. Agatha poured over her academic records, compiling glowing professor reviews and proof of her contributions to campus projects. Rio reached out to Alice, who promised to help track down any witnesses who could vouch for her character.</p><p>Wanda, meanwhile, worked behind the scenes to dig into Evanora’s connections, her film background proving useful as she pieced together the web of people the woman had influenced.</p><p>Billy tried to help where he could, but the tension in the apartment weighed heavily on him. One night, he approached Wanda quietly. “Is this all my fault?” he asked, his voice small.</p><p>Wanda immediately knelt in front of him, her hands on his shoulders. “No, Billy. None of this is your fault. Evanora is targeting us because she’s a cruel, vindictive person. But we’re going to fight this. Together.”</p><p>Just as they began to feel a sliver of hope, another blow came. Rio received an email with a video attached—a grainy recording of her and Billy breaking into Evanora’s house and Rio picking the lock of her basement door.</p><p>Her heart sank as she read the accompanying message: <em>“This is just the beginning. Drop your little act, or I’ll make sure everyone sees this.”</em></p><p>She showed the email to Agatha, who swore under her breath. “She’s trying to scare us.”</p><p>“It’s working,” Rio admitted, her voice shaky. “What if this gets out?”</p><p>Agatha took her hands, her gaze steady. “We’ll figure it out. Lilia will know what to do.”</p><p>That evening, the group gathered around the table, the weight of the situation heavy on their shoulders. Agatha looked around at their little family, her determination solidifying.</p><p>“She wants us to break,” Agatha said, her voice firm. “But we’re not going to give her the satisfaction.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her jaw set. “We fight. No matter what.”</p><p>Wanda placed a reassuring hand on Billy’s shoulder, her gaze fierce. “Together.”</p><p>The sense of unity in the room was palpable. Evanora had underestimated them—and they were about to prove her wrong.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Wanda was in the middle of a call with a legal advisor from <em>The Road</em> when her phone buzzed with an email notification. Glancing at it briefly, she froze. The subject line read: <strong>Formal Objection to Adoption Filing – Wanda Maximoff.</strong> Her heart sank as she opened the email.</p><p>Reading through the attached document, her stomach twisted. Evanora had officially contested her adoption application, citing her “irregular work schedule” and “emotional instability” as grounds for unfitness.</p><p>The claims were brutal, emphasizing her late hours on film sets and her past visits to psychologists following her family’s death. While every word stung, the implication that her mental health struggles made her unfit to parent Billy was a blow that hit hardest.</p><p>When she ended the call and sat at the kitchen table, Billy wandered in, holding a comic book. “What’s wrong?” he asked, his voice filled with concern.</p><p>Wanda quickly folded the papers and forced a smile. “Nothing, kiddo. Just some boring legal stuff.”</p><p>Billy’s brow furrowed, but he didn’t push. “If you say so,” he mumbled, though his worried glance lingered as he left the room.</p><p>In the meantime, Rio was pacing in the living room, the crumpled threatening letter in her hands. Her jaw clenched as she read the words again:</p><p>
<em>“Drop the lawsuit, or you’ll end up with more than a stab next time. Accidents happen.”</em>
</p><p>The implication made her blood run cold. The words dredged up memories of the night she was stabbed while protecting Agatha. The attack had always felt random—or so she had thought. Now, she wasn’t so sure.</p><p>“Agatha!” she called, her voice tight.</p><p>Agatha emerged from her room, her expression shifting to concern as she saw Rio’s face. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Rio handed her the letter, watching as Agatha’s eyes scanned the page, her grip tightening. “She’s behind this, isn’t she?” Rio said, her voice low. “The night you got attacked...it wasn’t random.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart raced, her mind flashing back to that night—the attacker, the chaos, the blood. “If she’s threatening you, it’s not just about the lawsuit anymore,” she said, her voice firm. “This is personal.”</p><p>Wanda joined them in the living room, her usual confident demeanor replaced with a tired, frustrated energy. “Evanora’s contesting the adoption,” she said, holding up the objection documents. “She’s claiming my work schedule and my past mental health make me unfit.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “She’s really coming after all of us.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her voice laced with bitterness. “She doesn’t care about Billy. She just wants to destroy everything we’ve built.”</p><p>Billy entered the room quietly, lingering near the doorway. “What’s going on?” he asked, his voice hesitant.</p><p>The room fell silent as the three women exchanged glances. Rio stepped forward, kneeling to meet Billy’s gaze. “It’s...complicated,” she began, her tone gentle. “But I promise, we’re going to figure it out.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes narrowed slightly. “It’s about me, isn’t it? Because of the adoption?”</p><p>Wanda sighed, stepping closer and placing a hand on Billy’s shoulder. “Part of it, yes. But none of this is your fault.”</p><p>That evening, they all gathered around the table, their little family feeling the strain of Evanora’s relentless attacks. Lilia joined them via video call once again, her expression grim as she listened to their latest troubles.</p><p>“This is beyond harassment,” Lilia said firmly. “We’re dealing with someone who’s not just vindictive but dangerous.”</p><p>“What can we do?” Wanda asked, her voice tight.</p><p>“We fight back,” Lilia replied. “For Wanda, we need character witnesses—people who can attest to her ability to care for Billy despite her schedule. As for Evanora’s claims about mental health, they’re discriminatory and baseless. We’ll use that to our advantage.”</p><p>“And what about Rio?” Agatha asked. “If Evanora’s behind the stabbing...”</p><p>“We escalate the case,” Lilia said. “We bring this to law enforcement as a coordinated campaign of harassment and threats. But it’s going to take time—and Evanora is counting on you to break under pressure.”</p><p>After the meeting, the group lingered at the table, the weight of the situation pressing down on them. Billy broke the silence, his voice quiet but determined. “You’re not giving up, are you?”</p><p>“Not a chance,” Wanda said immediately, reaching out to ruffle his hair. “We’ve come too far to let her win.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, her hand brushing against Agatha’s. “We’re not going anywhere, kid.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her gaze steady. “We’re in this together. No matter what.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes filled with tears, but he quickly wiped them away, his smile growing. “Okay. Then I’ll help too. Whatever you need.”</p><p>Wanda pulled him into a hug, her voice breaking slightly as she said, “We’ve got this, Billy. All of us.”</p><p>As the group held onto each other, the flicker of hope in their hearts burned brighter. Evanora had underestimated them—and that was her biggest mistake.</p>

<p>The morning light filtered through the apartment windows, illuminating the quiet tension that hung in the air. Agatha sat at the kitchen table, her laptop open in front of her. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, scrolling through emails and academic records. Every detail mattered, and she couldn’t afford to miss anything that might prove her integrity.</p><p> </p><p>Across the room, Wanda was sprawled on the couch with a legal pad, her brow furrowed as she jotted down notes. Billy was curled up nearby, flipping through a comic book, though his occasional glances toward the adults betrayed his awareness of the heaviness in the room.</p><p> </p><p>Rio emerged from her room, her footsteps soft but her expression tight. She went straight to the coffee maker, her movements deliberate as if trying to ground herself. After pouring two mugs, she placed one in front of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Coffee?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked up, a small smile tugging at her lips despite the tension in her eyes. “Please.”</p><p> </p><p>As Rio leaned against the counter, sipping her coffee, Wanda looked up from her notes. Her voice broke the silence, steady but laced with determination. “We need a plan. A real one. Evanora’s not going to stop until she gets what she wants—or until we stop her.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, closing her laptop for a moment. “The problem is, she’s got resources we don’t. Lawyers, connections, and money. And she knows exactly where to hit us.”</p><p> </p><p>“And she’s hitting hard,” Rio muttered, her grip tightening around her mug. “But if she thinks we’re going to roll over, she’s dead wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda nodded, her expression fierce. “We fight back. Every step of the way.”</p><p> </p><p>The quiet determination of the morning carried through the day until Alice arrived, laptop in hand and a determined look on her face. She dropped onto the living room floor, crossing her legs as she powered on her device.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright,” Alice began, her voice breaking the silence. “I’ve been digging into Evanora’s connections, trying to find any cracks we can exploit.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Rio leaned forward from their spots on the couch, their interest piqued. Wanda joined them, her arms crossed as she stood behind the group.</p><p> </p><p>Alice pulled up a series of documents and emails. “I found someone. A former employee of Evanora’s who might be willing to talk.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why would they help us?” Wanda asked, skepticism in her tone.</p><p> </p><p>Alice grinned, tapping her keyboard. “Because she ruined their life, too. Fired them, blacklisted them from their industry, and basically left them with nothing. If anyone has a reason to hate her, it’s this guy.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned forward, her eyes narrowing. “And he’s willing to talk?”</p><p> </p><p>“I sent him a message through a private forum, I told him it was an interview for an expose” Alice replied. “He’s cautious, which makes sense, but he’s agreed to meet tomorrow. Neutral location.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you trust him?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Alice shrugged. “No guarantees, but it’s the best lead we’ve had so far.”</p><p> </p><p>The air in the apartment shifted as the group processed Alice’s revelation. For the first time in days, there was a sliver of hope—fragile but unmistakable.</p><p> </p><p>Billy sat on the armrest of the couch, his comic forgotten in his lap. “So, this guy...Ralph? He could really help us?”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe,” Alice said cautiously. “If he has any dirt on Evanora, it could strengthen our case.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda frowned, her arms still crossed. “We’ll need to be careful. If Evanora catches wind of this, she’ll do everything she can to shut him up.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, her expression firm. “We’ll be careful. But we can’t afford to let this opportunity slip through our fingers.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced at Alice, her tone curious. “What do we know about this guy?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not much,” Alice admitted. “He’s kept a low profile since Evanora fired him. But his posts on the forum suggest he’s got a lot to say—if we can convince him to trust us.”</p><p> </p><p>After dinner, the group began winding down for the night. Agatha and Rio found themselves in the kitchen, cleaning up the dishes while the others retreated to their rooms. The quiet allowed them to speak freely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio, her brow furrowing as she noticed the tension in her girlfriend’s shoulders. “Are you okay?” she asked softly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitated, her hands stilling on the dish she was drying. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “Those letters...they’ve been messing with my head. I can’t stop thinking about what they said. About you. About the attack.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha set down her dish, stepping closer to Rio. She placed a hand on her arm, her gaze steady. “Rio, listen to me. We’re going to get through this. Together.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled faintly, though her eyes glistened with unshed tears. “You always know what to say.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s because I have the smartest girlfriend in the world,” Agatha replied, her tone teasing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled, the sound easing some of the tension in the room. “You’re not so bad yourself, Harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>The next morning, the group reconvened around the table. Lilia joined via video call, her expression as sharp as ever as she listened to their updates.</p><p> </p><p>“This lead sounds promising,” Lilia said. “If this former employee has anything on Evanora, it could make a huge difference. But you’ll need to be cautious. Evanora has a knack for sniffing out threats before they fully materialize.”</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll be careful,” Agatha assured her. “But we can’t let fear stop us.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” Lilia said, nodding. “As for the adoption case, Wanda, I’m working on gathering character witnesses and countering Evanora’s claims about your mental health along with the other lawyers. It’s a long road, but it’s not impossible.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s jaw tightened, but she nodded. “Whatever it takes.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms. “And what about the letters? If Evanora’s behind them, that’s a criminal case, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Potentially,” Lilia replied. “But we’ll need more concrete evidence to tie her directly to the threats.”</p><p> </p><p>The weight of Lilia’s words settled over the group, but their resolve remained unshaken. They were in for a fight—and they weren’t backing down.</p><p> </p><p>That evening, the group gathered in the living room, the tension of the day giving way to a rare moment of peace. An old movie played on the TV, its familiar dialogue filling the room as they relaxed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned against Rio on the couch, her fingers laced with hers. Wanda sat beside Billy, who was dozing off with his head on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>For a brief moment, it felt like nothing else mattered. They were together, and that was enough.</p><p> </p><p>But they all knew this was only the beginning. The real battle was still ahead.</p><p> </p><p>~~~~~</p><p> </p><p>The credits of the movie scrolled across the screen as everyone lingered in their spots, reluctant to break the tranquility of the evening. Agatha stretched lazily on the couch, her fingers lightly brushing against Rio’s. She turned her head toward Wanda, who sat cross-legged on the armchair, a mug of tea balanced precariously on the armrest.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Wanda,” Agatha began casually, her voice cutting through the stillness. “Remember that date you were getting ready for when Billy first showed up at the apartment?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda blinked, her fingers tightening around the mug. “Yeah, I remember. Why?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned forward, her curiosity piqued. “How did it go?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda shifted in her seat, clearly caught off guard. “It was...fine,” she replied, her tone measured. “He’s a nice guy.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy, who had been flipping through a comic book on the floor, perked up. “Wait—Wanda went on a date? With who?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked, leaning back against the couch. “Someone named Vision. PhD student. Robotics. Sounds like a total brainiac.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shot Rio a look but didn’t correct her. “Yeah, what’s the story there? Is he still in the picture?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda sighed, setting her mug down carefully. “I mean, we’ve been texting a bit. He’s nice. A little awkward, but in a charming way.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy tilted his head. “So...what happened? Why haven’t you gone out again?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda hesitated, her fingers brushing against the edge of her mug. “Life happened,” she admitted finally. “With everything going on—Billy’s arrival, Evanora’s nonsense, the adoption process—I haven’t exactly had the time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Did he stop texting?” Rio asked, her brow furrowing slightly.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Wanda admitted. “He’s been...understanding. More than I probably deserve. But I wouldn’t blame him if he decided to walk away. I mean, look at everything he doesn’t know yet.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy frowned, his comic book forgotten. “What doesn’t he know?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda glanced at him, her expression softening. “You, kiddo. The adoption. Everything that comes with it.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy looked down, his face falling slightly. “Oh.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees as she tried to find the right words. “It’s not that I’m ashamed of any of this,” she said carefully. “It’s just...how do you bring up something like that on a second date? ‘Hey, by the way, I’m in the middle of adopting a teenager while also dealing with my best friend's estranged mother who’s trying to ruin my life.’ That’s a lot for anyone to take in.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, her gaze steady. “If he’s worth it, he’ll understand.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “You make it sound so simple.”</p><p> </p><p>“It is,” Rio chimed in. “You’re overthinking it. If he’s the kind of guy who can’t handle your reality, then he’s not worth your time.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda let out a soft laugh, though her expression remained troubled. “I wish it were that easy.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy, still sitting on the floor, spoke up hesitantly. “But what if he does understand? What if he’s okay with all</p><p> </p><p>Wanda looked at him, her heart twisting at the hope in his voice. “That’s a big ‘what if,’ Billy. And I’m not sure I’m ready to take that chance.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy frowned, his brow furrowing. “But...you should at least try, right? If he makes you happy?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s lips curved into a faint smile. “It’s not just about me, kiddo. This is about all of us. If I bring someone into this...mess, it affects everyone.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy’s voice grew quieter. “I wouldn’t mind. If he makes you happy, I’d be okay with it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees. “You know, Wanda, you’re really good at putting everyone else first. Maybe it’s time you let yourself come first for once.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, crossing her arms. “You’ve been bending over backward for all of us. You deserve to have something for yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda opened her mouth to argue, but Billy interrupted, his voice firm. “They’re right. You’ve done so much for me already. You should be able to do this for yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda glanced between the three of them, her defenses wavering. “I don’t know...”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to know,” Agatha said gently. “You just have to try.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda sighed, rubbing her temples as she processed their words. Finally, she looked up, her resolve softening. “Okay. I’ll text him. See if he’s free.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy grinned, his excitement palpable. “You won’t regret it!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked, nudging Agatha. “Mission accomplished.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress a small smile. “Don’t celebrate yet. This could still go horribly wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>“Or it could go perfectly right,” Agatha countered. “You’ll never know unless you try.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda pulled out her phone, typing a quick message and hitting send before she could second-guess herself. “Okay,” she said, setting the phone down with a deep breath. “Now we wait.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry,” Rio said with a wink. “We’ve got your back.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back, her smile warm. “And if he’s not as amazing as you say, we’ll scare him off for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda laughed, the tension easing from her shoulders. “You’re impossible. All of you.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy grinned, his voice light. “Yeah, but you love us.”</p><p> </p><p>“Unfortunately, I do,” Wanda replied, her smile softening. “Now, let’s hope Vision’s as patient as he seems.”</p><p> </p><p>~~~</p><p> </p><p>The soft glow of the desk lamp cast a warm circle of light in the otherwise dim living room. Wanda was seated at the table, her legal pad filled with scribbles and notes. Billy sat across from her, flipping through a stack of papers she’d asked him to help organize. The house was quiet, save for the occasional muffled sound from Rio and Agatha’s room as they settled in for the night.</p><p> </p><p>Billy glanced up from his task, his expression pensive. “Wanda?”</p><p> </p><p>She looked up, her pen pausing mid-note. “Yeah, Billy?”</p><p> </p><p>He hesitated, biting his lip. “Can I...ask you something?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda set her pen down, folding her hands in front of her. “Of course. What’s on your mind?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy fidgeted with the papers in front of him, his gaze fixed on the table. “I’ve been thinking. About...you. And Vision.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda tilted her head, surprised. “What about us?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well...” Billy’s voice faltered, and he shifted uncomfortably. “It’s just...you haven’t been on another date with him. And it’s because of me, isn’t it?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda frowned, leaning forward. “Billy, that’s not true. Things have just been...busy.”</p><p> </p><p>“But they’re busy because of me,” Billy pressed, his voice cracking slightly. “If it wasn’t for all this adoption stuff, you wouldn’t be stuck here. You’d be able to go out and have fun and...and live your life.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s heart ached as she watched him, his shoulders hunched and his hands trembling slightly. “Billy—”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe you shouldn’t do this,” Billy interrupted, his voice barely above a whisper. “Maybe you shouldn’t adopt me. It’s just...I don’t want to ruin your life.”</p><p> </p><p>The words hit Wanda like a punch to the gut. She sat back, her hands gripping the edge of the table as she processed what he’d said. Finally, she stood and walked around to his side of the table, kneeling so she could look him in the eye.</p><p> </p><p>“Billy,” she said softly, her voice steady despite the emotions swirling inside her. “Look at me.”</p><p> </p><p>He hesitated, his gaze still fixed on the table, but eventually, he lifted his eyes to meet hers.</p><p> </p><p>“This is not your fault,” Wanda said firmly. “None of this. The adoption, the chaos with Evanora, the long nights—it’s not because of you. It’s because of her. And because of how much I care about you.”</p><p> </p><p>“But—” Billy started, but Wanda held up a hand to stop him.</p><p> </p><p>“I need you to listen to me,” she continued. “I’m not backing down. Not now, not ever. I’m not giving up on you. And do you know why?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy shook his head, tears welling in his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Because you’re worth it,” Wanda said, her voice breaking slightly. “You’re worth every sleepless night, every meeting, every fight. You deserve a family, Billy. And I want to be that family for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy’s lip quivered as he looked at her. “But what about Vision? What if he walks away because of all this?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda smiled gently, reaching out to squeeze his hand. “If he’s the right person, he won’t. If he really cares about me, he’ll understand. Just like Agatha and Rio said.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy sniffled, wiping at his face with the back of his hand. “You really think so?”</p><p> </p><p>“I know so,” Wanda replied. “But even if he doesn’t...that doesn’t change how I feel about you. You’re my priority, Billy. Always.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy’s tears spilled over as he threw his arms around her, hugging her tightly. Wanda held him close, her own eyes glistening with emotion.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Billy whispered. “I didn’t mean to make things harder for you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not making anything harder,” Wanda said, her voice firm but kind. “You’re making my life better. Don’t ever forget that.”</p><p> </p><p>After a long moment, they pulled apart, and Wanda ruffled his hair, her smile returning. “Now, how about we finish up here so we can both get some sleep?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy nodded, his smile small but genuine. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>As they returned to their tasks, the tension in the room had eased, replaced by a newfound understanding between them. Wanda glanced at Billy every so often, her heart swelling with pride and love.</p><p> </p><p>For the first time in a long time, she felt like she was exactly where she was meant to be.</p><p> </p><p>~~~~</p><p> </p><p>The morning sun streamed through the apartment windows, casting a warm glow over the living room. Wanda sat cross-legged on the couch with a steaming cup of coffee, her phone in hand as she stared at the message thread with Vision.</p><p> </p><p>He had responded almost immediately to her text the night before, his reply brimming with enthusiasm. “I’d love to! How about dinner at 7? You pick the place.”</p><p> </p><p>Her heart had skipped a beat when she read it. Now, as she reread the message for the tenth time, a nervous flutter settled in her stomach. It had been weeks since their first date, and she couldn’t shake the worry that he might feel differently about her now—or that she might have forgotten how to do this.</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda, stop staring at your phone,” Agatha teased, walking into the room with a bagel in hand. “You’re going to wear out the screen.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not staring,” Wanda protested, though she quickly put the phone down.</p><p> </p><p>Rio plopped onto the couch beside her, grinning. “She’s totally staring. You’re nervous, aren’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda sighed, leaning back into the cushions. “I haven’t done this in a long time, okay? What if it’s weird? What if he’s changed his mind?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy poked his head out of the kitchen, a piece of toast in his mouth. “If he changed his mind, he wouldn’t have said yes. Duh.”</p><p> </p><p>“Even the kid gets it,” Rio said with a smirk. “You’re overthinking it, Wanda. You’ll be fine.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, her tone softening. “You’ve got this. Now, let us help you get ready. You’re going to knock his socks off.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The afternoon turned into a flurry of activity as Agatha, Rio, and Billy helped Wanda prepare. Wanda stood in her room, staring at her closet as the others crowded around her.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Wanda said, holding up a sleek black dress. “This is good, right? Classy but not overdone?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, considering. “It’s nice, but...do you want to go for ‘classy’ or something a little more you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded in agreement. “She’s right. You need something that screams Wanda Maximoff.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy, who was lounging on the bed, pointed at a deep red wrap dress hanging in the corner. “What about that one? It’s cool, and red’s kind of your thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda smiled, pulling the dress from the rack. “You think?”</p><p> </p><p>“Absolutely,” Rio said with a grin. “You’ll look amazing.”</p><p> </p><p>By early evening, Wanda was almost ready. Her hair was styled in loose waves, and the red dress fit her perfectly, highlighting her scarlet hair and giving her an air of quiet confidence. She stood in front of the mirror, adjusting her earrings as Agatha and Rio looked on.</p><p> </p><p>“You look stunning,” Agatha said sincerely. “Vision won’t know what hit him.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda chuckled, though her nerves still simmered beneath the surface. “Thanks. I just...I hope this goes well.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. “It will. And if it doesn’t, you’ve got us to fall back on.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy appeared in the doorway, holding up a thumbs-up. “Ten out of ten. He’s going to love it.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda smiled, her heart warming at their encouragement. “Okay. Wish me luck.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda arrived at the small Italian restaurant she’d chosen, her heels clicking softly against the cobblestones as she approached the entrance. Vision was already there, waiting by the door in a crisp button-up shirt and dark jeans. He looked up as she approached, his face lighting up with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda,” he said warmly. “You look...incredible.”</p><p> </p><p>Her cheeks flushed, and she smiled back. “Thank you. You don’t look so bad yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>He held the door open for her, and they stepped inside, the cozy atmosphere of the restaurant instantly putting her at ease. The soft lighting, the gentle hum of conversation, and the aroma of freshly baked bread created a perfect backdrop for the evening.</p><p> </p><p>As they settled at their table, Vision leaned forward slightly, his hands resting on the edge of the table. “I’m really glad you texted,” he said. “I was starting to think I might have scared you off after the first date.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda laughed softly, shaking her head. “Not at all. Things have just been...complicated lately.”</p><p> </p><p>“Complicated how?” he asked gently.</p><p> </p><p>She hesitated, her fingers brushing against the edge of her glass. “There’s a lot going on in my life right now. Family stuff, work stuff...it’s been hard to balance.”</p><p> </p><p>Vision nodded, his expression understanding. “I get that. And I hope you know, I don’t expect you to have it all figured out. I’m just...happy to be here.”</p><p> </p><p>His sincerity brought a genuine smile to Wanda’s face. “Thank you. That means a lot.”</p><p> </p><p>As the evening went on, the conversation flowed easily, their shared laughter and thoughtful exchanges rekindling the connection they’d felt on their first date.</p><p> </p><p>After dinner, Vision walked Wanda to her car, the cool night air wrapping around them. They paused by the driver’s side door, the streetlights casting a soft glow over their faces.</p><p> </p><p>“I had a great time tonight,” Vision said, his voice quiet but sincere.</p><p> </p><p>“Me too,” Wanda replied, her nerves finally melting away. “Thank you for being so patient.”</p><p> </p><p>He smiled, his hand brushing against hers. “For you, Wanda? Always.”</p><p> </p><p>The moment lingered, and Wanda felt a surge of warmth as she realized she wasn’t just grateful for the date—she was genuinely excited about what might come next.</p><p> </p><p>“Goodnight, Vision,” she said, her voice soft as she took a moment and approached him, giving him a gentle kiss on the cheek. </p><p> </p><p>“Goodnight, Wanda,” he replied, his smile lingering as he watched her drive away as he placed his, fingertips on where Wanda's lips were just seconds ago. </p><p> </p><p>~~~~</p><p> </p><p>Back at the apartment, the atmosphere was significantly more relaxed. Agatha was stretched out on the couch with a book in hand, occasionally peeking over at the others. Rio was rummaging through the fridge, her voice muffled as she complained about the lack of snacks.</p><p> </p><p>Billy sat cross-legged on the living room floor, meticulously setting up a Monopoly board. He glanced at Agatha and smirked. “You’re joining this game, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her book with a sigh. “I don’t know if I have the patience for this.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re playing,” Billy declared, pointing to an empty spot. “And you’re going to lose.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sauntered back into the room, holding a bag of chips and looking far too smug. “Yeah, Aggie. Join us. We’ll go easy on you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Coming from you, Vidal, that sounds like a lie.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy grinned. “It’s definitely a lie.”</p><p> </p><p>The game started with high energy. Billy quickly bought up the railroads, grinning mischievously as he counted his money. Agatha, ever methodical, analyzed every move and carefully calculated her purchases. Rio, however, had a different strategy—one that involved a suspiciously good knack for getting out of paying rent.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait a second,” Billy said, narrowing his eyes at Rio as she placed her piece on one of Agatha’s properties. “You didn’t pay rent.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m pretty sure I did,” Rio said casually, tossing some play money onto the pile. “You must’ve missed it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced up from her stack of deeds. “Uh-huh. Sure you did.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned, her expression far too innocent. “What? You think I’m cheating?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy crossed his arms. “Absolutely.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed, leaning back. “Fine, I’ll pay the rent. But only because I’m generous.”</p><p> </p><p>The game continued, and Rio’s suspicious behavior only grew more blatant. She somehow managed to avoid paying for properties, sneak extra $500 bills into her pile, and mysteriously skipped over every tax space.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, that’s it,” Billy declared, slamming his hand on the board. “Rio’s cheating!”</p><p> </p><p>“I am not!” Rio protested, her face the picture of mock offense.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned forward, smirking. “Rio, you’ve landed on my hotel three times, and I haven’t seen a dime.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve got good lawyers,” Rio said, shrugging. “What can I say?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy grabbed the rulebook, flipping through it furiously. “There’s no ‘good lawyers’ card in Monopoly!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled, leaning over the board. “Relax, Teen. It’s just a game.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy glared at her. “You’re going down, Vidal.”</p><p> </p><p>Despite the accusations and Rio’s questionable strategies, the game carried on, laughter filling the apartment. Billy landed on Boardwalk with a hotel and groaned dramatically. “This is rigged.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not rigged,” Agatha said, smirking as she collected his rent. “It’s called skill.”</p><p> </p><p>“Or luck,” Rio muttered, still clutching her ever-growing pile of $500 bills.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha eyed Rio’s pile and snatched a few bills from it. “And this is called justice.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey!” Rio protested, trying to grab them back.</p><p> </p><p>Billy laughed, his earlier frustration forgotten. “That’s what you get for cheating.”</p><p> </p><p>As the game began winding down, Billy glanced at Rio, his tone quieter. “Do you think Wanda’s scared?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio, who had been in the middle of trying to steal money from the bank, froze. “Scared? About what?”</p><p> </p><p>“About letting someone new in,” Billy said, his voice thoughtful. “With everything going on, I mean.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha placed a hand on Billy’s shoulder, her voice soft. “Maybe. But Wanda’s strong. She’s braver than she thinks.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, leaning back. “If Vision’s worth her time, he’ll stick around. And if he doesn’t? She’ll be fine. Wanda’s tough like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy fiddled with his piece on the board, his expression thoughtful. “I hope so.”</p><p> </p><p>As the clock neared midnight, the sound of a key turning in the lock caught their attention. Wanda stepped inside, her cheeks slightly flushed and a soft smile on her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Look who’s back,” Rio teased, leaning against the couch. “Did Vision sweep you off your feet?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes, though her smile didn’t fade. “It was...nice.”</p><p> </p><p>“Just ‘nice’?” Agatha said, raising an eyebrow. “Come on, we need details.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda shook her head, slipping off her shoes. “Not tonight. I’m tired. Maybe tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy grinned. “Did he say anything cheesy?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda laughed, ruffling his hair as she passed. “Goodnight, Billy.”</p><p> </p><p>As she disappeared into her room, Agatha turned to Rio, smirking. “She’s totally smitten.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned, her hand darting toward the Monopoly board to snatch another $500 bill. “And I totally won this game.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy groaned, throwing his hands in the air. “You’re impossible!”</p><p> </p>

<p>The apartment had taken on an entirely new energy over the past couple of days. Every surface seemed to be covered in papers, notes, and laptops. The living room had become the unofficial war room, with Lilia occasionally joining via video call to guide them through the legal intricacies.</p><p>Billy sat cross-legged on the couch, sorting through stacks of printed documents with a focus unusual for his age. Wanda was at the dining table, poring over case files and preparing character witness statements, her face set with determination. Agatha and Rio worked side by side, reviewing evidence and drafting rebuttals, their whispered conversations punctuated by the occasional groan of frustration.</p><p>“Does anyone even remember what day it is?” Rio muttered, rubbing her temples.</p><p>“Tuesday,” Billy replied without looking up. “At least, I think it’s Tuesday.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, stretching her arms. “It doesn’t matter. All that matters is that we’re ready for this trial.”</p><p>Despite the tension, the group worked like a well-oiled machine. Wanda took charge of compiling her own defense against Evanora’s claims about her mental health, drawing on letters from her past therapists and colleagues who could vouch for her stability.</p><p>Billy helped by reaching out to some of Wanda’s friends for support, his genuine sincerity convincing even the most hesitant to offer a statement.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio and Agatha focused on the letters and emails Rio had received, working with Alice to trace their origins and tie them directly to Evanora. Alice popped in and out of the apartment, delivering updates and tips as she uncovered more about Evanora’s network.</p><p>As the days turned into nights, exhaustion began to set in, but no one was willing to stop. One evening, as the others drifted off to bed, Agatha found Wanda still sitting at the table, her head in her hands.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said softly, placing a hand on Wanda’s shoulder. “You need to sleep.”</p><p>Wanda looked up, her eyes tired but determined. “I can’t. There’s too much to do.”</p><p>Agatha pulled out a chair and sat down beside her. “We’re going to get through this. You’re not alone in this fight.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, a small smile tugging at her lips. “I know. But it’s hard not to feel like everything’s on my shoulders.”</p><p>“It’s not,” Agatha said firmly. “We’re all in this together.”</p><p>The following afternoon, Rio attempted to lighten the mood by ordering pizza for lunch. She placed the boxes on the table with a flourish. “Alright, everyone. Mandatory break time.”</p><p>Billy’s face lit up as he grabbed a slice. “Finally. Food.”</p><p>Wanda smiled faintly, watching as Rio playfully swatted Billy’s hand away from the soda. “It’s nice to see some normalcy for a change.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, taking a bite of her slice. “We need these moments. Otherwise, we’ll all burn out.”</p><p>Rio raised her slice in a mock toast. “To winning this trial and taking Evanora down.”</p><p>“To family,” Wanda added, raising her water glass.</p><p>Billy grinned, raising his soda. “To both.”</p><p>By the end of the second day, they had made significant progress. Wanda’s case was shaping up, Rio’s evidence was coming together, and Lilia had secured several witnesses willing to testify against Evanora.</p><p>As they gathered around the living room to review their work, the mood was cautiously optimistic. “We’re getting there,” Wanda said, her voice filled with quiet determination. “We can do this.”</p><p>“We will do this,” Agatha corrected. “We don’t have a choice.”</p><p>Billy looked around at the group, his heart swelling with pride. “You guys are amazing, you know that?”</p><p>Rio ruffled his hair. “You’re not so bad yourself, Teen.”<br/><br/>~~~~~~</p><p>As the days turned into nights, exhaustion began to weigh heavily on everyone, but no one was willing to stop. One evening, as the apartment grew quiet, Rio wandered into the living room and found Agatha still seated at the table, surrounded by stacks of papers and her laptop.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said softly, leaning against the doorway. “What are you still doing up?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up, her focus glued to the screen. “There’s too much to do. We’re so close, and I don’t want to miss anything.”</p><p>Rio stepped closer, placing a hand on Agatha’s shoulder. “Ags, you’ve been at this for hours. You need to sleep.”</p><p>Agatha finally looked up, her face tired but resolute. “I can’t. Not yet. What if there’s something I’m missing? Something important?”</p><p>Rio pulled out a chair and sat beside her, resting her hand over Agatha’s. “You’re not doing this alone. We’re all in this together, remember? You’re allowed to take a break.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, leaning back in her chair. “I know, but it feels like everything depends on getting this right.”</p><p>Rio’s voice softened. “It does. But you can’t pour from an empty cup. Sleep, recharge, and we’ll pick it back up tomorrow. The world isn’t going to end because you take a few hours to rest.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then gave a small nod. “Alright. You win. But only because I don’t want to argue with you right now.”</p><p>Rio grinned, standing and pulling her up. “Smart choice. Come on. I’ll even tuck you in.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled as Rio guided her to her room. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said with a wink. “Now go. Sleep. That’s an order.”<br/><br/>~~~~~~</p><p>Alice adjusted her laptop bag over her shoulder as she entered the small café where the meeting was set to take place. It was a cozy, nondescript spot, perfect for a discreet conversation. She scanned the room, her eyes settling on a man seated in a corner booth. He was in his late 30s, with a slightly disheveled appearance that suggested life had been unkind to him.</p><p>Ralph Bohner.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Alice approached the table. “Mr. Bohner?”</p><p>He looked up, his blue eyes wary but curious. “You must be Alice. Have a seat.”</p><p>Alice slid into the booth, placing her bag beside her. She ordered a coffee from the waiter before turning back to Ralph. “Thank you for agreeing to meet me.”</p><p>Ralph shrugged, leaning back in his seat. “I’m not sure how much help I can be, but if it screws over Evanora, I’m in.”</p><p>Alice smiled faintly. “That’s the spirit. Can I ask how you ended up working for her?”</p><p>Ralph snorted, shaking his head. “She recruited me about five years ago. Said she needed someone to handle PR for her ‘projects.’ Seemed like a good gig at first. Decent pay, flexible hours...but then I started seeing the cracks.”</p><p>“Cracks?” Alice prompted, pulling out her notepad.</p><p>Ralph’s jaw tightened. “She’s manipulative. Ruthless. She doesn’t care who she steps on to get what she wants. And if you cross her, you’re done. She made sure I couldn’t work in PR again after I left.”</p><p>Alice’s pen stilled. “She blacklisted you?”</p><p>“Completely,” Ralph said bitterly. “Spread rumors, sabotaged interviews...she made sure I was untouchable.”</p><p>Alice leaned forward, her voice softening. “I’m sorry that happened to you. But we’re trying to stop her from doing the same to others. Can you tell me anything about her tactics? The way she operates?”</p><p>Ralph hesitated, his fingers tapping against the table. “She’s got connections everywhere. Politicians, lawyers, business executives—they’re all in her pocket. She uses them to control people, to make problems disappear. But she’s careful. She doesn’t leave a trail.”</p><p>Alice frowned. “What about the threats? We’ve been receiving letters and emails that we suspect are from her.”</p><p>Ralph’s lips curled into a grim smile. “That sounds like her. She likes to use intermediaries—employees, contractors—so nothing can be traced back to her directly. But I can tell you this: if she’s targeting you, she sees you as a threat. And that means she’s getting desperate.”</p><p>Ralph reached into his bag and pulled out a small folder. “I don’t have much, but I kept some documents from when I worked for her. Emails, project notes...things that didn’t sit right with me.”</p><p>Alice accepted the folder, her heart racing as she flipped through its contents. There were internal memos referencing questionable financial transactions, notes about leveraging certain individuals, and even vague mentions of “disciplinary actions” against employees.</p><p>“This is incredible,” Alice murmured. “Do you think there’s more?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Ralph said. “But I wouldn’t know where to look. Evanora’s a control freak. She keeps everything under lock and key.”</p><p>As their conversation wound down, Alice leaned back, her coffee untouched. “Thank you, Ralph. This could really help us.”</p><p>Ralph studied her for a moment, his expression softening. “Be careful. Evanora doesn’t play fair. If she thinks you’re getting close to something big, she’ll come after you.”</p><p>Alice nodded, her resolve hardening. “We’ll be ready.”</p><p>As she left the café, clutching the folder tightly, Alice couldn’t help but feel a spark of hope. Ralph’s information wasn’t a smoking gun, but it was a step in the right direction—and every step brought them closer to taking Evanora down.<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The apartment was alive with quiet activity when Alice walked in. Papers were spread across the coffee table, Billy was scribbling notes at the dining table, and Wanda was perched on the armrest of the couch, her phone pressed to her ear. Agatha and Rio sat side by side, whispering over a set of files.</p><p>“Hey,” Alice called softly, closing the door behind her. Everyone looked up, their expressions shifting to concern at the tightness in her face.</p><p>“What did you find?” Wanda asked, setting her phone down.</p><p>Alice didn’t wait for an invitation, dropping her bag onto the floor and pulling out the folder Ralph had given her. “You were right about Evanora’s reach. She’s got connections everywhere—politicians, lawyers, executives. She uses them to manipulate, to silence people.”</p><p>Agatha reached for the folder, flipping through its contents. The color drained from her face as she scanned the memos and notes. “This...this is bad.”</p><p>Alice nodded, her voice tight. “And there’s more. Ralph said the letters and threats are her style. She uses intermediaries, so nothing can be traced back to her directly. She’s careful, but if we dig deep enough, we might find something.”</p><p>Wanda exhaled sharply, running a hand through her hair. “We’re running out of time. This trial is coming up fast. It's in less than a week”</p><p>Alice’s voice softened. “There’s something else. Ralph warned us—if she feels threatened, she’ll escalate.”</p><p>The room fell into a heavy silence, the weight of Alice’s words pressing down on them like a physical force.</p><p>Agatha stood abruptly, her movements jerky. “I need some air,” she muttered, walking to the balcony without looking at anyone.</p><p>Rio frowned, watching her go. “Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond, sliding the glass door shut behind her. She gripped the railing tightly, the cold metal biting into her palms. Her chest felt like it was caving in, each breath shallower than the last.</p><p>Her mind raced, a cacophony of thoughts drowning out everything else. The memories of Evanora’s cruelty, the looming trial, the weight of protecting her found family—it all pressed down on her like a crushing wave. She gasped, her vision blurring as her knees buckled.</p><p>Rio followed her moments later, stepping onto the balcony with quiet urgency. She froze when she saw Agatha hunched over, her breaths coming in rapid, uneven bursts.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said gently, stepping closer. “Hey, hey, look at me.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, her voice barely a whisper. “I...I can’t...breathe...”</p><p>Rio dropped to her knees in front of Agatha, placing her hands gently on her arms. “Agatha,” she said softly, her voice calm but urgent. “You’re having a panic attack. I’m right here. Look at me.”</p><p>Agatha’s wide, terrified eyes met Rio’s, her breaths coming in rapid, shallow bursts. “I...can’t...”</p><p>“Yes, you can,” Rio said firmly, her grip steady but gentle. “We’re going to do this together. Listen to me. Let’s ground you. I need you to name five things you can see.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, her vision blurry. Her voice was shaky as she whispered, “The...the railing. The city lights. Your...eyes.”</p><p>“That’s three,” Rio encouraged softly. “Two more.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze darted around, her chest heaving. “The...sky. And...and my hands.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio said, her voice soothing. “Now, four things you can touch.”</p><p>Agatha’s trembling fingers reached for the railing. “The railing. My shirt. The...the concrete.”</p><p>“One more,” Rio prompted, her hands still steadying Agatha.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then whispered, “Your hands.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly. “That’s perfect. Three things you can hear?”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, her breathing hitching but slowing. “The cars. The...wind. And...your voice.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio said, her tone steady. “Now, two things you can smell.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled shakily, her chest rising and falling. “The...city air. And...you.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, the sound warm and grounding. “Alright. One thing you can taste?”</p><p>Agatha’s tongue darted over her lips. “Coffee,” she murmured, her voice steadier now.</p><p>“That’s it,” Rio said, her tone filled with quiet pride. “You’re doing great, Aggie. Keep breathing with me. In through your nose, out through your mouth.”</p><p>She exaggerated each breath, demonstrating the rhythm. Agatha followed as best she could, her breaths slowly evening out. The tightness in her chest began to ease, and her hands stopped trembling.</p><p>When Agatha’s breathing steadied, she slumped against the railing, her body trembling. Rio stayed close, her hands never leaving Agatha’s. “You’re okay,” she whispered. “You’re okay.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky laugh, wiping at her tear-streaked face. “I’m sorry. That was...I don’t know what that was.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, her voice soft but firm. “Don’t apologize. You’ve been holding everything in for so long, Aggie. It’s okay to feel this way.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, her eyes red and glistening. “I’m supposed to be the strong one. The one who has it all together.”</p><p>“Being strong doesn’t mean never breaking,” Rio said gently. “It means letting yourself feel it and coming back from it. And you’re not alone in this. You don’t have to carry everything by yourself.”</p><p>Agatha’s lip quivered, and she let out a deep, shuddering breath. “I don’t know if I can do this, Rio. Evanora...she always wins.”</p><p>Rio cupped Agatha’s face, forcing her to meet her gaze. “Not this time. We’re going to fight her, and we’re going to win. Together.”</p><p>The two of them stayed on the balcony for a long moment, the sounds of the city below providing a quiet backdrop. Agatha leaned into Rio’s touch, drawing strength from her steady presence.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha whispered. “For being here.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly, brushing a strand of hair from Agatha’s face. “Always. You don’t have to go through this alone, Aggie. Not ever.”</p><p>As they re-entered the apartment, the others looked up, their concern evident. Agatha offered them a small, tentative smile. “I’m okay,” she said quietly. “Let’s get back to work.”</p><p>And as they returned to their tasks, the bond between them felt stronger than ever, a quiet reminder that even in their darkest moments, they had each other.</p><p>~~~~~~<br/>The apartment had settled into a calm lull after the intense moments on the balcony. Agatha sat at the table, pretending to review some papers, but her mind was elsewhere. She kept stealing glances at Rio, who leaned against the counter, drinking water. The tension from earlier lingered in the air, like a storm that hadn’t fully passed.</p><p>Rio set her glass down and sighed, running a hand through her hair. “I’m going to take a shower,” she said, her voice quiet but resolute. “I need to clear my head.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, watching as Rio disappeared down the hallway toward the bathroom. She sat there for a moment, her thoughts swirling, before pushing back her chair and standing. Her feet carried her toward the bathroom almost instinctively.</p><p>The steam filled the bathroom, clouding the mirror and creating a hazy, intimate atmosphere. She closed her eyes, letting the warmth soothe her nerves, but the anxiety of the upcoming trial against Evanora Harkness still lingered. Rio knew this case could make or break her career, and the pressure was taking its toll. Her hands slid down her body, attempting to calm her racing heart, but it was no use. She needed something, or someone, to take her mind off the impending court battle.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Rio, her girlfriend,had similar thoughts.She knew Rio was at her breaking point, and she wanted to provide some much-needed relief. Quietly, she entered the bathroom, her bare feet padding softly on the tiled floor. The sight of Rio's slender figure through the translucent shower curtain made her heart flutter. Agatha's eyes traced the curves of Rio's body, from her long, wet hair to her toned legs, and a familiar hunger stirred within her.</p><p>Agatha's fingers gently pushed the curtain aside, revealing her stunning figure. Her freckled skin glistened in the steam, and her nipples hardened in the warm, moist air. Rio's breath caught in her throat at the sight. She had been so lost in her thoughts that she hadn't heard Agatha enter. Now, with her girlfriend standing before her, naked and desirable, Rio's worries momentarily faded away.</p><p>"Agatha," Rio whispered, her voice hoarse with desire. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>Agatha's lips curved into a mischievous smile. "I couldn't let you face this day alone, my love. I know you're stressed, so am I, and I want to help you relax."</p><p>Rio's eyes darkened with a mixture of desire and uncertainty. "But...are you sure?"</p><p>Agatha stepped into the shower, the water cascading over her body, mingling with Rio's. "We both need to take our minds off things."</p><p>With that, Agatha leaned in and captured Rio's lips in a passionate kiss. Rio's initial hesitation melted away as Agatha's tongue danced with hers, their mouths moving in perfect harmony. Agatha's hands roamed over Rio's wet body, cupping her breasts and teasing her nipples, causing Rio to gasp into the kiss.</p><p>Agatha broke the kiss, leaving Rio breathless. "Let me take care of you," she murmured, her breath hot against Rio's ear. "Let's forget about the trial for now."</p><p>Rio nodded, her resistance crumbling. She knew Agatha was right; they needed this moment. As if reading her mind, Agatha's hands slid down Rio's stomach, past her navel, and into the dark curls between her thighs. Rio's body jerked in response, her head falling back as Agatha's fingers found her clit and began to circle it gently.</p><p>"Oh, Agatha," Rio moaned, her voice echoing off the bathroom tiles. "Yes, there... Oh god, that feels so good."</p><p>Agatha's touch was gentle yet firm, her fingers working their magic as she massaged Rio's clit, building up the pleasure. She knew exactly how to touch Rio, having spent long nights exploring her lover's body. As Rio's breath quickened, Agatha inserted a finger into her, eliciting a sharp gasp.</p><p>"Shh, love," Agatha whispered, her lips brushing Rio's ear. "We have to be quiet. Don't want anyone to hear us."</p><p>Rio nodded, her eyes fluttering shut as Agatha's finger began to thrust inside her, slowly at first, then with increasing urgency. The hot water continued to pour over them, adding to the sensual experience. Agatha's free hand reached up to pinch Rio's nipple, causing her to arch her back and press her breasts into Agatha's touch.</p><p>"You feel so fucking good, Rio," Agatha whispered, her voice raspy with desire. "I love making you wet like this."</p><p>Rio's hands clutched at Agatha's shoulders, her nails digging into her skin as the pleasure intensified. Agatha's finger worked in and out of her, hitting all the right spots, while her thumb continued to rub her clit in steady circles. Rio's legs began to tremble, and she bit her lip to stifle a loud moan.</p><p>"Come for me, Rio," Agatha urged, her own body trembling with restrained desire. "Let it all out."</p><p>Rio's orgasm built like a tidal wave, crashing over her in waves of pleasure. She cried out, her voice muffled by the sound of the shower, as she clenched around Agatha's finger. Agatha held her tightly, her own body shaking with the effort of holding back her release.</p><p>As Rio's tremors subsided, Agatha kissed her gently, their lips meeting in a tender embrace. "Feel better, my love?" Agatha asked, her eyes sparkling with affection.</p><p>Rio nodded, a satisfied smile on her face. "Much better. I needed that."</p><p>Agatha chuckled, her fingers trailing down Rio's arm. "I know you did. But we should get going soon. They might notice I'm gone for too long"</p><p>Rio's hands slid down Agatha's wet body, cupping her breasts and teasing the sensitive peaks. She kissed Agatha's neck, her lips leaving a trail of wetness, as she whispered, <em>"Let me take care of you, baby. I want to make you feel good as well."</em></p><p>Agatha leaned back against the shower wall, her eyes fluttering open, and a hint of a smile playing on her lips. She knew Rio's intentions and was more than willing to surrender to her lover's skilled touch. <em>"Please, Rio,"</em> she breathed, her voice husky with desire. <em>"I want to feel your mouth on me. Make me forget everything but you."</em></p><p>Rio's eyes darkened with desire as she sank to her knees, the water cascading over her body, creating a sensual display. She positioned herself between Agatha's legs, her hands gripping Agatha's thighs, spreading them wider. The sight before her was a tantalizing invitation—Agatha glistening with desire, the pink folds already swollen and ready. Rio inhaled the musky scent, her mouth watering at the thought of tasting her lover.</p><p>With slow, deliberate movements, Rio leaned forward, her tongue darting out to trace the length of Agatha's slit. She started at the top, teasing the sensitive bud of her clit, causing Agatha to gasp and grip the shower wall for support. Rio's tongue flicked and circled, building up the anticipation, before plunging into the warm, wet depths of Agatha's wetness.</p><p>Agatha's body jerked as Rio's tongue delved deep, exploring every inch of her wetness. Rio's mouth suckled and licked, her tongue mimicking the motions of a skilled lover, driving Agatha wild with pleasure. She let out a gentle whimper as Rio's tongue found her sweet spot, sending waves of ecstasy through her body.</p><p><em>"Oh, fuck, Rio,"</em> Agatha panted, her head thrown back, her wet hair sticking to her neck. <em>"Your mouth feels so good. Don't stop, please."</em></p><p>Rio responded by increasing the intensity, her tongue working feverishly, lapping at Agatha's throbbing clit, sending jolts of pleasure through her body. She inserted a finger into Agatha, curling it upwards to hit that magical spot, causing Agatha to cry out in ecstasy. Rio's other hand reached up to pinch and twist Agatha's nipple, knowing how sensitive she was, heightening the sensations.</p><p>Agatha's legs began to tremble as Rio's relentless tongue and fingers pushed her closer to the edge. Her body was on fire, every nerve ending screaming for release. She clutched at Rio's hair, her hips thrusting uncontrollably, as she surrendered to the overwhelming pleasure.</p><p><em>"I'm gonna cum, Rio,"</em> she whispered, her voice hoarse with desire. <em>"Eat me, baby, make me cum with your mouth."</em></p><p>Rio's only response was a deep, throaty growl as she redoubled her efforts, her tongue and fingers working in perfect harmony. She wanted to taste Agatha's essence, to feel her lover's release on her tongue. Agatha clenched around Rio's finger, and her body stiffened as the orgasm hit her like a tidal wave.</p><p>Agatha's muffled cries filled the bathroom as her juices flowed, flooding Rio's mouth. Rio savored the taste of her lover, swallowing every drop, her tongue never slowing, milking Agatha's orgasm until the last tremors subsided.</p><p>As Agatha's body relaxed, Rio gently kissed her inner thighs, her hands caressing her lover's trembling body. She looked up, her eyes meeting Agatha's, and smiled, her face glistening with Agatha's essence. <em>"You taste so fucking good, baby,"</em> she purred. <em>"I love making you cum like that."</em></p><p>Agatha pulled Rio up, their bodies pressing together, water dripping from their skin. She kissed Rio passionately, their tongues entwining, sharing the taste of their passion. <em>"You're incredible, Rio,"</em> she whispered between kisses. <em>"I love how you take care of me. I feel so safe with you.I love you"</em></p><p>Rio held Agatha tightly, her heart swelling with love and desire. <em>"I love you too. I'll always take care of you, my love,"</em> she promised. <em>"And I'll make sure you cum harder and harder each time. I want to explore every inch of your beautiful body."</em></p><p>Agatha's eyes sparkled with anticipation. <em>"I can't wait, Rio."</em></p><p>The lovers stepped out of the shower.<br/>Rio wrapped herself in a towel, glancing at Agatha with a smile that felt like a promise. “Feel better?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said, meeting her gaze. “I do.”<br/><br/>~~~~<br/>Agatha and Rio settled on the couch after the shower, their exhaustion softened by the quiet intimacy they shared. The apartment was silent except for the faint rustle of papers as Wanda, still at the dining table, sifted through adoption documents. Billy was already asleep on the couch, his head buried in a pillow, his comic book lying forgotten on the floor.</p><p>“You think we’ll ever catch a break?” Rio asked softly, her arm draped over Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head back to look at her, her fingers absentmindedly tracing circles on Rio’s arm. “If we can get through this trial and stop Evanora, maybe. Until then? I’m not holding my breath.”</p><p>Rio sighed, her hand tightening slightly around Agatha’s. “You’re not alone in this, Aggie. None of us are.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched into a small smile. “I know. And thank God for that.”</p><p>The next morning dawned uneventfully, but the sense of calm felt uneasy, like the quiet before a storm. Agatha woke up early and found Wanda sitting on the balcony, her phone in hand, staring at the horizon.</p><p>“Can’t sleep?” Agatha asked, stepping out with a cup of tea.</p><p>Wanda shook her head, her gaze distant. “Just...thinking. About Billy. About the adoption. About Evanora.”</p><p>Agatha sat beside her, taking a sip of her tea. “We’ll get through this. Together.”</p><p>Wanda glanced at her, her smile faint but genuine. “Thanks, Aggie. But there’s something I’ve been wondering... Why now? Why is Evanora escalating things now, after all these years of staying in the shadows?”</p><p>Agatha’s expression darkened. “Because she knows she’s losing control. She’s desperate.”</p><p>“Desperation makes people dangerous,” Wanda murmured.</p><p>“And predictable,” Agatha countered, her eyes narrowing. “We can use that against her.”</p><p>As they spoke, Rio appeared in the doorway, her phone in hand and a concerned expression on her face. “Aggie, Wanda. You need to see this.”</p><p>They stepped back inside as Rio handed over her phone. The screen displayed a news article that had been published just hours earlier. The headline read: Legal Battle Brews Over Controversial Adoption Case Involving Prominent Businesswoman.</p><p>“It’s starting,” Rio said grimly. “Evanora’s playing the media card.”</p><p>Wanda scanned the article, her jaw tightening. It painted her in a harsh light, questioning her stability and suitability as an adoptive parent while lauding Evanora’s so-called concern for Billy’s well-being.</p><p>“She’s controlling the narrative,” Wanda said through clenched teeth. “This is bad.”</p><p>Agatha placed a hand on her shoulder. “It’s not over yet. We can counter this.”</p><p>“How?” Wanda asked, her voice sharp. “She has every outlet in her pocket.”</p><p>“Not every outlet,” Rio interjected. “Alice and I have been working on a piece. If we publish it at the right time, it could shift public opinion.”</p><p>Later that day, the apartment buzzed with activity as the group strategized. Alice arrived with her laptop and notes, her energy determined as she spread her findings across the table.</p><p>“We need to hit her where it hurts,” Alice said. “Show the public who she really is.”</p><p>“Can we tie her to the letters?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Not definitively,” Alice admitted. “But we can highlight the people she’s hurt—like Ralph Bohner. If he’s willing to speak out, it could be huge.”</p><p>Agatha leaned forward, her expression sharp. “And if we can connect her to the threats against Rio, that’s our ace in the hole.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her eyes hard. “Let’s make her regret ever underestimating us.”</p><p>By evening, the group had laid the groundwork for their counterattack. Wanda’s gaze softened as she looked around at her found family—Billy sorting through papers with surprising focus, Alice typing furiously on her laptop, Rio and Agatha leaning over a shared notebook, heads close together.</p><p>For the first time in days, Wanda allowed herself a glimmer of hope. They weren’t just fighting a battle—they were building a future.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said softly, her voice breaking the quiet.</p><p>Everyone looked up, confused.</p><p>“For what?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“For fighting this with me,” Wanda said, her voice steady despite the emotion in her eyes. “I don’t know if I could do this without you.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Good thing you don’t have to.”</p><p>Agatha reached for Wanda’s hand, squeezing it.</p><p>~~~~<br/><br/></p><p>Alice was finishing up her research late in the evening, her desk cluttered with stacks of notes, highlighted printouts, and her laptop glowing faintly in the dim dorm room. The knock on her door startled her; she wasn’t expecting visitors.</p><p>Pushing her chair back, she hesitated for a moment before walking to the door. A small, unmarked package lay on the floor. Confused, she picked it up and closed the door behind her. There was no label, no sender information—just her name written hastily in black marker.</p><p>Her stomach twisted with unease.</p><p>Sitting at her desk, she carefully opened the package. Inside was a folded piece of paper, stained with something dark and red. Her hands trembled as she unfolded it, revealing a mock-up of one of her investigative articles on Evanora. The title and her byline were bold and unmistakable.</p><p>The blood-like stains smeared across the page made her breath hitch. Attached to the mock-up was a chilling note written in jagged handwriting:<br/><strong>“Stop the lawsuit, or this will be you next time.”</strong></p><p>Alice froze, her mind racing. She scanned the package for any clues about its origin, but there was nothing. Her heartbeat thundered in her ears as panic clawed at her chest.<br/><br/>Barely able to think, Alice shoved the paper and note into her bag and grabbed her coat. She couldn’t stay in her dorm. Whoever had sent the package knew where she lived, and the thought made her skin crawl. Without pausing to double-check her keys, she rushed out of the building and headed straight to Agatha and Rio’s apartment.</p><p>By the time she arrived, she was out of breath, her cheeks flushed from the cold night air. She knocked on the door urgently, her hands trembling.</p><p>Agatha was the first to answer, her expression immediately shifting to concern when she saw Alice. “Alice? What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Can I—” Alice’s voice broke, and she swallowed hard, trying to steady herself. “Can I come in?”</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha said, stepping aside to let her in.</p><p>Rio appeared from the living room, her brow furrowed. “What happened?”</p><p>Alice dropped her bag onto the table, pulling out the bloodied article and the note. Her hands shook as she unfolded them, laying them flat for everyone to see.</p><p>“This,” she said, her voice trembling. “This happened.”</p><p>Wanda, who had been sitting with Billy in the living room, joined them at the table. Her eyes widened as she took in the note and the mock-up. “What the hell is this?” she asked, her tone sharp.</p><p>“Someone sent it to my dorm,” Alice said, her voice barely above a whisper. “No label, no return address. Just this.”</p><p>Rio picked up the note, her jaw tightening as she read it. “This is Evanora,” she said, her voice low and furious. “It has to be.”</p><p>Agatha sat down, her hands clasped tightly in front of her. “She’s escalating,” she said grimly. “First the threats to Rio, now this.”</p><p>Billy’s voice was small as he asked, “Is Alice going to be okay?”</p><p>Wanda placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “We’ll make sure she is,” she said firmly. “No one is touching her.”<br/><br/>Agatha looked at Alice, her expression softening. “I’m sorry this happened to you. You didn’t sign up for this.”</p><p>Alice shook her head, her eyes brimming with tears. “I did, though. I chose to get involved. I just didn’t think... I didn’t think it would get this personal.”</p><p>Rio reached over, placing a hand on Alice’s arm. “We’ll protect you. But you have to tell us if anything else happens. Don’t keep it to yourself.”</p><p>Alice nodded, her voice wavering. “What do we do now?”</p><p>Agatha leaned back, her mind racing. “We report this. Evanora thinks she’s untouchable, but this kind of threat won’t sit well in court. We can use this to strengthen our case.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her jaw set. “And we’ll make sure you’re not alone. Someone will always be with you, whether you’re at the dorm, campus, or here.”<br/><br/>As the group continued their discussion, Alice sat back, her hands trembling slightly. Rio noticed and leaned closer, her voice soft and steady. “You okay?”</p><p>Alice hesitated before shaking her head. “I’m scared, Rio. Whoever sent this—they know where I live. What if they come back? What if...?”</p><p>Rio squeezed Alice’s hand tightly, her eyes dark with determination. “You’re not going back to that dorm. You’re staying here with us.”</p><p>Alice opened her mouth to argue, but before she could, Wanda spoke up, her tone calm but resolute. “No. None of us are staying here.”</p><p>Everyone turned to look at her, surprised. “What do you mean?” Agatha asked cautiously.</p><p>Wanda straightened, brushing a hand through her scarlet hair. “I think it’s time we go to my house. The one my parents left me.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened slightly. She hesitated, glancing between Wanda and the others. “Your family home? Are you sure, Wanda? That place... it has a lot of memories.”</p><p>Wanda’s jaw tightened, but her gaze remained steady. “I know. But it’s also the safest place for us right now. It’s completely off the grid—no one knows it’s mine, and it’s not tied to me in any official capacity. I’ve made sure of that.”</p><p>Alice, who had been quietly listening, asked softly, “Where is it?”</p><p>“It’s about an hour out of the city, Billy has already been there and Agatha too” Wanda replied. “Big enough for all of us, and far enough away that Evanora’s reach won’t feel as suffocating.”</p><p>Agatha studied Wanda’s expression, seeing the quiet pain she was masking. “Are you sure you want to go back there?”</p><p>Wanda’s lips pressed into a thin line, and she nodded. “Yes. It’s time I faced it for good. And if it keeps us safe, it’s worth it. I want to be able to bring Billy there when this is all over”</p><p>The group quickly sprang into action, gathering their belongings and organizing what they needed for the temporary relocation. Wanda gave them a list of essentials, emphasizing that they should only bring what was necessary. “We don’t want to leave a trail,” she reminded them.</p><p>Billy packed his few clothes and personal items, while Alice gathered her laptop and research materials. Rio and Agatha worked together, organizing their case documents and ensuring nothing critical was left behind.</p><p>Agatha approached Wanda as the others packed, placing a hand on her arm. “You’re really okay with this?” she asked gently.</p><p>Wanda exhaled, her gaze softening. “I’m not exactly thrilled to go back there, but this isn’t about me. Plus I'll have all of you this time.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her respect for Wanda growing even more. “We’ll make it work.”</p><p>Wanda smiled faintly. “We always do.”</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>The apartment buzzed with activity as Agatha, Wanda, and Billy moved from room to room, ensuring they hadn’t left anything vital behind. Important documents, personal belongings, and even small comforts like photo frames and books were carefully packed into boxes and bags.</p><p>“Do we really need this many coffee mugs?” Billy asked, holding up two mismatched ones.</p><p>“Never underestimate the power of caffeine,” Agatha replied, taking the mugs and packing them in a box marked “kitchen essentials.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio grabbed her keys and turned to Alice, who was standing by the door with her laptop bag slung over her shoulder. “Ready?”</p><p>Alice nodded, her face pale but determined. “Yeah. Let’s do this.”</p><p>Alice’s dorm was eerily quiet as they arrived, the late hour amplifying every creak and shuffle of movement. Rio followed Alice inside, keeping a watchful eye as her friend hurriedly packed her belongings.</p><p>“Just the essentials,” Rio reminded her. “Clothes, your laptop, and anything you can’t live without.”</p><p>Alice nodded, throwing a few items into a duffel bag. Her hands trembled slightly, but she kept moving. “I can’t believe this is happening,” she muttered. “I thought dorm life would be the worst thing I’d have to deal with.”</p><p>Rio gave her a reassuring smile. “We’ll get through this. Stick with us, and you’ll be fine.”</p><p>As Alice zipped up her bag, she turned to Rio, her expression softening. “Thanks for coming with me. I don’t think I could’ve done this alone.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, slinging the duffel over her shoulder. “What are friends for?”</p><p>With Alice’s essentials packed, the two made a quick stop at a nearby grocery store. The fluorescent lights hummed softly as they moved through the aisles, filling their cart with canned goods, snacks, and basic staples.</p><p>“Do we really need four jars of peanut butter?” Alice asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“Wanda’s house is practically in the middle of nowhere,” Rio replied. “Better safe than sorry.”</p><p>They loaded the groceries into the car and climbed in, the tension from earlier starting to ease as they drove toward Wanda’s house. The roads were dark and quiet, the city lights fading into the distance.</p><p>The drive back from the grocery store had been uneventful, filled with quiet chatter as Alice and Rio discussed everything from the trial preparations to the best way to keep Billy occupied in a remote house. The road stretched out before them.</p><p>Then Rio pressed the brakes.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Her stomach lurched. She pressed harder, her foot sinking to the floor. Still, nothing.</p><p>“Uh... Alice?” Rio said, her voice tight.</p><p>Alice, who had been scrolling through her phone, looked up. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“The brakes aren’t working,” Rio replied, trying to keep her voice calm, though panic clawed at her chest.</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened. “What do you mean? Are you sure?”</p><p>Rio clenched the wheel tightly, nodding. “I’m sure. Hold on.”</p><p>Rio shifted the car into a lower gear, hoping to slow it down, but the steep incline of the road ahead only made the vehicle pick up speed. The road twisted sharply, with cliffs to one side and dense trees to the other. There wasn’t much time.</p><p>“Call Agatha,” Rio said, her voice urgent. “Now.”</p><p>Alice fumbled with the phone, her shaking fingers struggling to dial. She put the call on speaker, but it rang and rang. When it went to voicemail, Alice’s breath hitched.</p><p>“She’s not answering,” Alice whispered, panic creeping into her voice.</p><p>Rio gritted her teeth. “Then we leave a message.”</p><p>She grabbed the phone, her knuckles white as she steered with one hand. Her voice was steady, but the tension was palpable. “Agatha, it’s me. The brakes are gone, and we’re out of control. I don’t know if we’re going to make it.” She paused, her voice softening. “I love you, Agatha Harkness. You already know that, but I need you to hear it again just in case...”</p><p>Alice’s voice broke beside her. “Tell her to tell Jen...”</p><p>Rio glanced at her, her heart breaking at the tears in Alice’s eyes. “Tell Jen that Alice loves her,” she said into the phone. “It’s not the way she wanted to say it, but... she needs her to know.”</p><p>Rio ended the message and tossed the phone onto the dashboard. “Brace yourself,” she said, gripping the wheel tightly. “I’m going to try to steer us into the trees.”</p><p>The car careened toward the edge of the road, the wheels skidding as Rio yanked the wheel toward the trees. The sound of crunching metal and shattering glass tore through the night as the car collided with a thick trunk. The force of the impact was brutal, throwing both women forward despite their seatbelts.</p><p>The silence that followed was deafening.</p><p>Smoke rose from the hood of the car, the engine hissing faintly. Inside, neither Rio nor Alice stirred. Blood streaked Rio’s temple, her head slumped against the steering wheel. Alice’s phone lay on the floor, the voicemail still logged in the call history.</p><p>Back at the apartment, Agatha’s phone buzzed on the counter, but she was too busy packing to notice. It wasn’t until Wanda pointed it out that Agatha picked it up, her brow furrowing at the missed call notification.</p><p>She played the voicemail, Rio’s voice filling the room. The calm veneer Agatha had maintained shattered as she heard Rio’s trembling words.</p><p>“...The brakes are gone, and we’re out of control... I love you, Agatha Harkness. You already know that, but I need you to hear it again.”</p><p>Agatha froze, her breath catching in her throat. “No,” she whispered, her voice breaking.</p><p>Wanda, alarmed by Agatha’s expression, rushed over. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Agatha handed her the phone, her hands shaking. “It’s Rio. Something happened. We have to find her.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t hesitate, grabbing her keys. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Agatha, Wanda, and Billy piled into the car, the tension palpable as they sped toward the road Rio and Alice had taken. Agatha’s knuckles were white as she gripped her phone, trying to call Rio over and over, but each attempt went straight to voicemail.</p><p>“They can’t be far,” Wanda said, her voice steady but tense. “We’ll find them.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, though fear gnawed at her. Every minute felt like an eternity, the worst-case scenarios playing on a loop in her mind.</p><p>As they rounded a curve, the wreckage came into view. Agatha gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. The car was crumpled against a tree, smoke still rising from the hood.</p><p>“Stop the car!” Agatha shouted, and Wanda pulled over abruptly.</p><p>They rushed to the wreckage, their hearts pounding as they saw the motionless forms of Rio and Alice inside.</p>

<p>The car was a mangled wreck, the front crumpled around the trunk of a tree. Smoke curled lazily into the night sky, the smell of burned rubber and gasoline heavy in the air. Agatha’s heart pounded in her chest as she sprinted toward the car, Wanda close behind her. Billy trailed a few steps back, frozen in shock.</p><p>“Rio! Alice!” Agatha’s voice cracked as she reached the driver’s side. Her trembling hands tried to open the door, but it was stuck. “Help me!” she screamed, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>Wanda rushed to the passenger side, yanking at the handle. The door groaned before it gave way, and she immediately leaned in to check Alice. The younger woman was slumped in her seat, blood trickling from a cut on her forehead.</p><p>“She’s breathing,” Wanda called out, her voice steady but urgent. “Agatha, what about Rio?”</p><p>Agatha clawed at the driver’s side door until Wanda joined her, both women putting their weight into it. Finally, the door creaked open, and Agatha leaned in, her hands shaking as she gently touched Rio’s face. Her pulse was faint but steady.</p><p>“She’s alive,” Agatha whispered, relief flooding her voice. “But she’s hurt. Badly.”</p><p>Wanda pulled out her phone and dialed emergency services, her voice calm and efficient as she relayed their location and the situation. “Two injured, one unconscious, both breathing. We need an ambulance immediately.”</p><p>Agatha stayed by Rio’s side, brushing a strand of blood-matted hair from her face. “Rio,” she murmured, her voice breaking. “You’re going to be okay. Just hold on.”</p><p>Billy stood a few feet away, his arms wrapped tightly around himself. His face was pale, and his eyes were wide with fear. Wanda noticed and walked over to him, placing a hand on his shoulder. “Billy, look at me,” she said gently. “They’re going to be okay. The ambulance is coming.”</p><p>He nodded mutely, his lip trembling. “She can’t die, Wanda. She can’t.”</p><p>“She won’t,” Wanda said firmly, pulling him into a brief hug before turning back to help Agatha.</p><p>The wail of sirens cut through the still night air, and Agatha looked up, her heart pounding with a mix of relief and dread. The ambulance pulled up beside them, and paramedics rushed to the scene.</p><p>“Two victims,” Wanda explained quickly, pointing to Rio and Alice. “The driver is unresponsive but breathing. The passenger has a head wound but seems stable.”</p><p>The paramedics worked swiftly, checking vitals and stabilizing both women. Agatha hovered close to Rio, her hands balled into fists as they carefully placed her on a stretcher. “I’m coming with her,” she insisted, her voice shaking.</p><p>The paramedic nodded. “There’s room for one. Let’s move.”</p><p>The emergency room was a blur of activity. Agatha sat in the waiting area, her hands clasped tightly together. Wanda and Billy arrived shortly after, both of them looking equally frazzled. Billy sat beside Agatha, his small hand reaching out to grip hers.</p><p>“What did they say?” Wanda asked, sitting on Agatha’s other side.</p><p>“They took Rio into surgery,” Agatha said, her voice hollow. “She has internal bleeding. They’re doing everything they can.”</p><p>“And Alice?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“She’s stable,” Agatha replied. “They’re keeping her for observation, but they think she’ll be okay.”</p><p>The three of them sat in silence, the weight of the night pressing down on them. Every passing minute felt like an eternity.</p><p>Hours later, a doctor approached them, her expression serious but not grim. Agatha stood immediately, her heart in her throat. “How is she?”</p><p>“She’s stable,” the doctor said. “We managed to stop the bleeding and repair the damage. She’s in recovery now, but she’ll need to stay here for a few days.”</p><p>Agatha’s knees buckled with relief, and Wanda caught her before she fell. Tears streamed down her face as she whispered, “Thank you.”</p><p>The doctor nodded. “She’s lucky you got her here so quickly. You can see her once she’s moved to a room.”</p><p>When Agatha finally entered Rio’s room, her heart clenched at the sight. Rio looked small and fragile against the hospital bed, her skin pale and her breathing shallow but steady. Agatha pulled a chair close to the bed, taking Rio’s hand in hers.</p><p>“Hey, trouble,” Agatha whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “You scared the hell out of me, you know that?”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond, still under the haze of anesthesia, but her fingers twitched slightly in Agatha’s hand. Agatha leaned closer, her tears dripping onto their joined hands.</p><p>“I need you to wake up,” Agatha murmured. “I need to hear you tell me you’re okay. I need to hear you say...anything.”</p><p>She stayed by Rio’s side, her head resting against the bed, her exhaustion finally catching up with her. Wanda watched from the doorway, her own expression a mix of relief and worry.</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>While Rio lay unconscious, her mind drifted to a strange, shadowy place. The world was dim, the edges of her vision hazy and undefined. She felt weightless, yet tethered to something she couldn’t see. The faint sound of laughter echoed in the distance—a child’s laughter.</p><p>She turned toward it, and the haze parted slightly. A little boy stood in front of her, holding a tattered stuffed rabbit. His wide eyes sparkled with innocence, and his small, hesitant smile was achingly familiar.</p><p>“Billy?” Rio’s voice was barely a whisper, filled with confusion and longing.</p><p>The boy tilted his head, his expression shifting into something sad. “You’re supposed to protect me,” he said softly, his voice echoing like it was coming from everywhere and nowhere at once.</p><p>“I am,” Rio said, stepping toward him, but her feet felt heavy, like she was wading through molasses. “I’ll always protect you.”</p><p>The boy’s image shimmered, and suddenly, he wasn’t alone. Other children appeared—faces from Rio’s past, kids she’d shared foster homes with, kids she’d tried to shield from cruel foster parents and an uncaring system. Their eyes stared at her, accusing and full of pain.</p><p>“You couldn’t save us all,” one of them said, their voice sharp and cutting.</p><p>“I tried!” Rio protested, tears streaming down her face. “I did everything I could!”</p><p>The shadows around the children thickened, swirling like a storm, and the boy—Billy—stepped forward again. “You can’t save everyone, but you saved me. And you still have so much more to do.”</p><p>The storm intensified, the voices blending into an unintelligible roar. Rio felt herself falling, the shadows consuming her as Billy’s voice whispered one last time: “Wake up.”</p><p>Back in the real world, Agatha knelt beside Rio’s hospital bed, her hands clutching Rio’s pale, lifeless one. Her chest ached as she watched the shallow rise and fall of Rio’s breath. The monitors beeped steadily, but they didn’t ease the fear clawing at her.</p><p>“You can’t do this to me,” Agatha whispered, her voice trembling. “Not now. Not after everything.”</p><p>Wanda stood behind her, her hand on Agatha’s shoulder, offering silent support. “She’s strong, Aggie,” Wanda said softly. “She’s not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, tears spilling down her cheeks. “She shouldn’t have to be strong. She’s been through enough. This isn’t fair.”</p><p>Wanda crouched down beside her, squeezing her shoulder gently. “I know. But Rio’s a fighter. She’ll come back.”</p><p>Agatha buried her face in her hands, her sobs muffled. “She has to.”</p><p>In another hospital room, Alice stirred, her head pounding and her vision blurry. She groaned softly, the pain dragging her fully into consciousness. Jen’s face appeared above her, worry etched into every line.</p><p>“Alice,” Jen said, her voice breaking with relief. “You’re awake.”</p><p>“Jen?” Alice whispered, her voice hoarse. “What...what happened?”</p><p>“You were in a car accident,” Jen explained, her hand brushing Alice’s hair back gently. “But you’re okay. You’re safe.”</p><p>Alice frowned, her memories slowly piecing together. “The brakes...they didn’t work.”</p><p>Jen nodded, her jaw tightening. “Agatha told me. It wasn’t an accident.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened as the realization hit her. “Evanora. She did this. Because we were getting closer.”</p><p>“We’ll deal with her,” Jen said firmly. “But right now, you need to rest.”</p><p>Alice hesitated, tears welling in her eyes. “Rio...is she...?”</p><p>“She’s alive,” Jen reassured her quickly. “She’s still unconscious, but she’s alive.”</p><p>Alice exhaled shakily, relief washing over her. “Good. She’s too stubborn to go down like this.”</p><p>Hours later, as the sun began to rise, Rio’s fingers twitched. Agatha, who hadn’t left her side, noticed immediately and sat up straighter. “Rio?” she said, her voice hopeful.</p><p>Rio’s eyelids fluttered, her breathing hitching slightly before her eyes opened. They were unfocused at first, but slowly, her gaze sharpened, landing on Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha,” she murmured, her voice barely audible, her throat feeling dry and scratchy. </p><p>Agatha let out a choked laugh, tears streaming down her face as she leaned closer. “You’re awake. Oh my God, you’re awake.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched into a faint smile. “Didn’t mean to scare you,” she said, her voice raspy.</p><p>“You scared the hell out of me,” Agatha replied, her voice breaking. “Don’t you ever do that again.”</p><p>Rio’s hand weakly squeezed Agatha’s. “Promise.”</p><p>Later that day, Wanda, Billy, and Alice—now mobile with Jen’s help—gathered in Rio’s room. The atmosphere was a mix of relief and exhaustion, but the sight of Rio awake and alert brought smiles to everyone’s faces.</p><p>“You look like hell,” Rio joked, her voice still weak.</p><p>Alice smirked. “Says the woman who nearly got us killed.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes welled with tears as he stepped closer to Rio’s bed. “Don’t ever scare me like that again,” he said, his voice trembling.</p><p>Rio reached out to ruffle his hair. “I’ll try not to.”</p><p>As the group laughed softly, the tension that had gripped them for days began to ease. For a moment, they were just a family, grateful to still have each other.</p><p>That night, after everyone had left, Agatha stayed by Rio’s side, holding her hand as she drifted off to sleep. The faint sound of Rio’s breathing was the most comforting sound Agatha had heard in days.</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha whispered, her voice soft but firm. “And I’m going to make sure no one ever hurts you again.”</p><p>Rio stirred slightly in her sleep, her lips curving into a faint smile.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The hospital hallway felt cold and sterile as Agatha leaned against the wall, her phone clutched tightly in her hand. Her thumb hovered over Lilia’s contact, hesitating for just a moment before pressing call. The events of the past day had stripped her nerves raw, and she knew Lilia needed to hear what had happened. But saying the words out loud made it all feel so much more real.</p><p>Lilia picked up on the second ring. “Agatha? It’s late. Is everything alright?”</p><p>The familiarity of her mentor’s voice brought a lump to Agatha’s throat. She tried to speak but found herself choking on the first words. “No,” she finally managed, her voice breaking. “Everything is not alright.”</p><p>Lilia’s tone immediately sharpened. “What’s wrong? What happened?”</p><p>“Rio and Alice…” Agatha began, her voice trembling. She took a deep breath to steady herself. “They were in a car accident last night. The brakes failed.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence on the other end before Lilia’s measured voice returned, quieter now. “Failed? Agatha, are you saying—?”</p><p>“I’m saying it wasn’t an accident,” Agatha interrupted, her voice rising in frustration. “Someone tampered with the car. Someone tried to kill them.”</p><p>Lilia’s sharp inhale was audible through the phone. “Evanora,” she said, the name cutting like a blade.</p><p>“Who else could it be?” Agatha snapped, pacing the hallway. “She’s been escalating for weeks. Threats, intimidation, and now this? I can’t—I won’t let her get away with it.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice softened, a hint of something almost maternal creeping in. “Agatha, listen to me. First, you need to breathe. You can’t take her down if you’re falling apart.”</p><p>“I’m not falling apart,” Agatha insisted, though her trembling hands betrayed her. “I just—” She exhaled sharply, running a hand through her hair. “I need to do something. I can’t just sit here.”</p><p>“You won’t have to,” Lilia assured her. “We’re going to fight this. First, we need proof. I’ll call a forensic mechanic first thing in the morning to examine the car. If the brake lines were tampered with, they’ll find it.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice wavered. “And then what? What if Evanora’s people erased their tracks?”</p><p>“She’s sloppy when she’s desperate,” Lilia replied. “If she ordered this, there will be a trail. I’ll also request security footage from the grocery store and surrounding streets. If anyone was near the car, we’ll find them.”</p><p>Agatha sagged against the wall, her exhaustion catching up to her. “How did it come to this, Lilia? She’s not just targeting me anymore—she’s going after the people I love.”</p><p>“Because she knows she can’t control you anymore,” Lilia said. “She’s losing her grip, and it’s making her reckless. That’s her weakness, Agatha. You can use it against her.”</p><p>“I don’t want to play games with her,” Agatha whispered. “I just want her out of my life.”</p><p>“I know,” Lilia said gently. “But to make that happen, you need to stay strong. For Rio, for Alice, for everyone counting on you.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened, tears spilling down her cheeks. “I’m so tired, Lilia. I don’t know how much more of this I can take.”</p><p>“You’re stronger than you think,” Lilia said firmly. “And you’re not alone. You have Wanda, Rio, Billy, Alice—and you have me. We’re going to see this through.”</p><p>After the call ended, Agatha stood in the hallway for a long moment, staring at her phone. She felt drained but steadied by Lilia’s confidence. With a deep breath, she wiped her tears and made her way back to Rio’s room.</p><p>Inside, Wanda had arrived, sitting with Billy, her arm around his shoulders as they talked quietly. Rio was asleep, her chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm that filled Agatha with both relief and dread.</p><p>Wanda looked up as Agatha entered, her eyes narrowing in concern. “You okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, though her expression betrayed her fatigue. “I talked to Lilia. She’s arranging for experts to examine the car. She’s also going to try to pull security footage.”</p><p>Wanda exhaled, her shoulders relaxing slightly. “That’s good. We need everything we can get.”</p><p>Billy looked between them, his brow furrowed. “Will it help? Will it stop her?”</p><p>Agatha crouched in front of him, taking his hands in hers. “It’s a start. And with everything we’ve already built, it might be enough.”</p><p>Billy nodded hesitantly, his lips pressed into a thin line. “I just want this to be over.”</p><p>“Me too, Teen,” Agatha said softly. “Me too.”</p><p>That night, as the hospital quieted down, Agatha found herself alone with Rio once again. She sat by the bed, her fingers tracing idle patterns on the blanket covering Rio’s hand. Her heart ached at how fragile Rio looked, a stark contrast to her usual energy and fire.</p><p>“I talked to Lilia,” Agatha murmured, her voice barely audible in the still room. “She’s going to help. We’re going to figure this out. We’re going to stop her.”</p><p>Rio didn’t stir, but Agatha felt a faint squeeze of her hand, almost as if Rio could hear her even in her sleep.</p><p>Agatha leaned closer, pressing a soft kiss to Rio’s knuckles. “I’m not letting her win, Rio. Not this time. Not ever. You’re stuck with me, okay? So you’d better get better soon.”</p><p>Her voice cracked on the last words, but she didn’t care. She stayed there, her head resting on Rio’s arm, as the weight of the day finally caught up to her and pulled her into an uneasy sleep.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The morning light filtered through the hospital blinds, bathing the room in a pale glow. Agatha sat in a stiff chair by Rio’s bed, her coffee growing cold on the small table beside her. Wanda had brought breakfast earlier but had since gone to check on Alice and Billy.</p><p>Her phone buzzed on the table, the name Lilia Calderu lighting up the screen. Agatha grabbed it immediately, her heart pounding.</p><p>“Lilia?” she answered, her voice tight with anticipation.</p><p>“It’s confirmed,” Lilia said without preamble, her tone sharp but controlled. “The brakes were tampered with. It was subtle—whoever did it knew what they were doing. But there’s no doubt about it. This wasn’t an accident.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, her grip tightening on the phone. “I knew it,” she murmured, a mix of relief and anger coursing through her. “Thank you for confirming.”</p><p>“There’s more,” Lilia continued. “I’ve requested the footage from the grocery store and surrounding streets. I’ll need time to analyze it, but if there’s anything suspicious, we’ll find it.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, though Lilia couldn’t see her. “Good. We need everything we can get.”</p><p>As Agatha ended the call, her thoughts raced. She glanced at Rio, still resting but looking a little less pale than the day before. Something about the timing of the attack gnawed at her.</p><p>When Wanda returned, balancing a tray of coffee and muffins, Agatha met her with a grim expression. “Lilia confirmed it. The brakes were tampered with.”</p><p>Wanda sighed, setting the tray down on the small table. “I figured as much. Evanora’s not exactly subtle when it comes to her threats.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples. “It has to be connected to what Alice and Rio were working on. They were getting close to something big.”</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “Did Alice tell you anything before the crash?”</p><p>“No, but she told Rio,” Agatha replied. “And Rio was convinced they were onto something that could expose Evanora.”</p><p>Wanda frowned, crossing her arms. “If that’s true, we need to figure out what it is. Alice might remember.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I’ll talk to her. Whatever they found, it’s enough to make Evanora desperate—and desperate people make mistakes.”</p><p>Later that morning, Agatha made her way to Alice’s hospital room. The younger woman was sitting up in bed, her laptop open on the tray in front of her, a half-eaten muffin beside it. Jen sat in a chair nearby, looking every bit the attentive visitor.</p><p>“Knock, knock,” Agatha said softly, stepping inside.</p><p>Alice looked up, her tired eyes brightening slightly. “Hey. How’s Rio?”</p><p>“She’s stable,” Agatha said, taking a seat beside her. “She’s stubborn. She’ll be okay.”</p><p>Alice smiled faintly. “That sounds like her.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at Jen, who took the hint and stood. “I’ll give you two a minute,” Jen said, squeezing Alice’s shoulder before stepping out.</p><p>Once the door closed, Agatha leaned closer. “Alice, I need to ask you something. What were you and Rio working on before the crash?”</p><p>Alice’s expression grew serious, and she closed her laptop. “We were digging into Evanora’s finances. She’s got her claws in so many industries—real estate, tech, even some medical companies. But Rio found something strange.”</p><p>“What kind of strange?” Agatha asked, her voice low.</p><p>“Untraceable shell companies,” Alice explained. “She’s been funneling money through them for years, and it looks like she’s funding something...big. But we couldn’t figure out what.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, her mind racing. “You think that’s why she went after you two?”</p><p>Alice nodded. “Rio was getting close. She had a lead on someone who used to work for one of the shell companies. She was planning to reach out this week.”</p><p>“Do you still have the details?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Alice hesitated before pulling a flash drive from her laptop case. “It’s all on here. I’ve been too scared to look at it since the crash.”</p><p>Agatha took the drive, her grip firm. “We’ll figure this out, Alice. I promise.”</p><p>Back in Rio’s room, Agatha relayed the information to Wanda while Rio rested. Wanda’s expression darkened as she listened, her jaw tightening.</p><p>“This is why Evanora’s been escalating,” Wanda said. “She knows you’re close to exposing her.”</p><p>“And she’s willing to kill to stop us,” Agatha added grimly. She glanced at the flash drive in her hand, her resolve hardening. “But we’re not stopping. Not now.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda said softly, placing a hand on her shoulder. “You don’t have to carry this alone. We’re all in this together.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her throat tight. “I know. But I can’t lose Rio. Or Alice. Or you. We need to finish this—for all of us.”</p><p>Wanda squeezed her shoulder, her voice steady. “We will. And Evanora will pay for everything she’s done.”</p><p>That evening, as the hospital quieted down, Rio stirred, her eyes fluttering open. Agatha was at her side in an instant, her hand brushing Rio’s hair back gently.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio murmured, her voice weak but steady.</p><p>“Hey yourself,” Agatha said, her lips curving into a soft smile. “You scared me.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio whispered. “Didn’t mean to.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, tears welling in her eyes. “It’s not your fault. None of this is.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened, and she reached for Agatha’s hand. “You okay?”</p><p>“I am now,” Agatha said, squeezing her hand. “But we have work to do. You and Alice were onto something big, and Evanora knows it.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly. “We always did make a good team.”</p><p>Agatha leaned down, pressing a kiss to Rio’s forehead. “Rest, trouble. We’ll take it from here.”</p><p>Agatha paced the hallway outside Rio’s hospital room, her phone pressed tightly to her ear. Lilia’s calm but assertive voice filtered through the line.</p><p>“I managed to secure an extension,” Lilia said, the satisfaction in her voice clear. “The trial’s been delayed by two weeks. It’s not much, but it’ll give Rio and Alice enough time to be discharged and prepared.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, a wave of relief washing over her. “Thank you, Lilia. I don’t know how you pulled it off, but this means everything.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled softly. “Let’s just say the judge owed me a favor. Use the time wisely, Agatha. This is your chance to ensure everything is airtight.”</p><p>“We will,” Agatha promised. “And thank you—for everything.”</p><p>After ending the call, she returned to Rio’s room, where Wanda, Alice, and Billy were gathered around the bed. “Good news,” Agatha announced. “We’ve got an extension. Three days.”</p><p>The room collectively sighed in relief. Wanda nodded, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “That’s enough time. We’ll make it work.”</p><p>Rio grinned weakly from the bed. “Looks like I’ll get to testify after all.”</p><p>Later that evening, Alice sat alone in her hospital room, her laptop open on the tray in front of her. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, her thoughts racing. Something about the timing of Evanora’s interference still didn’t add up.</p><p>“She knew,” Alice murmured to herself. “She knew exactly what we were doing.”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she scrolled through her notes, her mind piecing together the puzzle. The only person outside their immediate circle who knew about their investigation was Ralph Bohner, the former employee of one of Evanora’s shell companies. Alice had met with him a week ago, hoping to glean information about the financial web Evanora had spun.</p><p>Her stomach sank as realization dawned. “He tipped her off,” Alice whispered, her hands clenching into fists.</p><p>Without hesitation, she grabbed her phone and dialed Ralph’s number. The line rang a few times before he picked up, his voice casual. “Alice? Didn’t expect to hear from you again.”</p><p>“Cut the crap, Ralph,” Alice snapped, her voice cold. “Did you tell Evanora about what we were investigating?”</p><p>There was a long pause on the other end of the line before Ralph sighed. “Look, Alice...she made me an offer I couldn’t refuse.”</p><p>Alice’s blood boiled. “You sold us out? After everything we talked about, after everything she’s done, you took her side?”</p><p>“She offered me a position at one of her companies,” Ralph said defensively. “A good position. I need to think about my future, Alice.”</p><p>“Your future?” Alice’s voice rose, her anger spilling over. “What about the people she’s hurt? The lives she’s destroyed? You’re okay with being part of that, as long as you get a paycheck?”</p><p>“It’s not that simple,” Ralph said, his tone laced with guilt. “I’m sorry, Alice, but I have to look out for myself.”</p><p>Alice’s hands trembled as she gripped the phone. “You’re a coward,” she spat. “And I hope that position was worth it, because you’ve lost any shred of integrity you had left.”</p><p>“Alice—” Ralph started, but she cut him off.</p><p>“Fuck off, Ralph,” she said sharply, ending the call and throwing her phone onto the bed.</p><p>Alice sat in silence for a moment, her chest heaving as she tried to calm herself. Her anger turned to frustration, and then to sadness as the betrayal sank in. She had trusted Ralph, and he had turned on them for a paycheck.</p><p>A knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts. Jen peeked inside, her expression softening when she saw Alice’s face. “Hey. You okay?”</p><p>Alice shook her head, her voice trembling. “Ralph sold us out. He told Evanora what we were working on.”</p><p>Jen’s jaw tightened as she stepped inside, closing the door behind her. “That bastard.”</p><p>Alice wiped at her eyes angrily. “I was stupid to trust him. I thought he wanted to help, but he was just looking out for himself.”</p><p>“You’re not stupid,” Jen said firmly, sitting beside her. “You were trying to do the right thing. That’s not stupid—that’s brave.”</p><p>Alice sniffled, leaning into Jen’s comforting embrace. “What do we do now?”</p><p>“We keep going,” Jen said. “We use what we’ve got, and we make sure Evanora doesn’t get away with this.”</p><p>The next morning, Alice joined the group in Rio’s room, her expression grim. Agatha noticed immediately and gestured for her to sit. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Alice hesitated, her gaze dropping to her hands. “I figured out how Evanora knew what we were doing. It was Ralph. He sold us out.”</p><p>Wanda cursed under her breath, her eyes narrowing. “That son of a—”</p><p>“He said she offered him a position,” Alice continued, her voice bitter. “And he took it.”</p><p>Rio, still pale but alert, frowned. “What did you say to him?”</p><p>“I told him to fuck off,” Alice replied simply.</p><p>Agatha nodded, her jaw tight. “Good. He’s not worth another second of your time.”</p><p>“But what if he knows more?” Wanda asked. “What if Evanora’s planning something else?”</p><p>“Then we need to be ready,” Agatha said. “We’ve already proven we can handle her worst. We’ll get through this, too.”</p><p>The group exchanged determined looks, their resolve stronger than ever. They were battered but unbroken, and they wouldn’t stop until Evanora was brought to justice.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>On the second night of their frantic preparations, Alice gasped from her hospital bed, her fingers flying across her laptop keyboard. “I’ve got something!”</p><p>Everyone turned toward her, their expressions a mix of exhaustion and hope.</p><p>“What is it?” Wanda asked, crossing the room to stand behind Alice.</p><p>“It’s a connection I missed before,” Alice said, her voice buzzing with excitement. “One of Evanora’s shell companies isn’t just funneling money—it’s tied to a real estate firm that’s been evicting tenants under shady circumstances. And that’s not all.”</p><p>Agatha leaned closer, her brow furrowing. “What else?”</p><p>Alice swallowed, her voice dropping as if the words themselves were toxic. “She’s funding conversion camps.”</p><p>The room went silent, the air heavy with shock and disgust. Agatha’s jaw clenched, her hands tightening into fists. “She’s funding what?”</p><p>“Conversion camps,” Alice repeated, her voice thick with anger. “Rehabilitation centers designed to ‘fix’ LGBTQ+ youth. They’re illegal in some states, but she’s found ways to funnel money into the ones still operating. She’s also funding advocacy groups pushing to keep them legal.”</p><p>Billy, who had been sitting quietly on the couch, suddenly stood, his fists shaking. “She’s funding people who hurt kids like me?” His voice was small, trembling with a mixture of anger and fear.</p><p>Wanda was at his side in an instant, wrapping him in a protective embrace. “It’s despicable,” she said, her voice trembling with fury. “But it also gives us another angle to take her down.”</p><p>Alice nodded, her eyes blazing. “If we can prove her connection to these camps, it’ll destroy her credibility. No one will want to associate with someone funding these atrocities.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was cold and steady, her resolve hardening. “We’re not just exposing her corruption—we’re making sure she pays for every single life she’s hurt.”</p><p>Later that evening, Alice presented her findings to the rest of the group in Rio’s room. The atmosphere was tense as they absorbed the gravity of the new information.</p><p>“These camps...” Rio began, her voice hoarse but steady. “They ruin lives. Some kids never recover.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Alice said. “If we can link Evanora directly to them, it’ll be a game-changer.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at Wanda, who was still holding Billy protectively. “We’ll need testimonies. Survivors, former employees, anyone who can confirm her involvement.”</p><p>Alice nodded. “I’ve already flagged a few names. I can reach out to them, but we’ll need to be careful. These people might be scared to come forward.”</p><p>“We’ll give them a reason to trust us,” Wanda said, her voice firm. “No one should have to face this alone.”</p><p>As the group prepared for the trial, the weight of their new discovery hung over them. The living room of Wanda’s house had become their war room, papers and laptops scattered across every surface.</p><p>Wanda worked quietly, organizing documents while keeping an eye on Billy, who had retreated to the couch with a blanket. He was uncharacteristically quiet, his gaze distant.</p><p>“Hey, Teen,” Wanda said softly, sitting beside him. “You okay?”</p><p>Billy hesitated before looking at her, his eyes glistening. “What if...what if they don’t believe us? What if she gets away with it?”</p><p>Wanda placed a hand on his shoulder, her voice steady. “She won’t. Because we’re not going to let her. And no matter what happens, you’re safe here. With me.”</p><p>Billy nodded, leaning into her side. “Thanks, Mom.”</p><p>~~~</p><p>The morning was crisp and clear as Rio and Alice were discharged from the hospital. Agatha and Wanda stood side by side in the hospital lobby, waiting for the paperwork to be finalized. Despite the relief of seeing their friends well enough to leave, the tension between them was palpable. Agatha’s exhaustion clung to her like a shadow, her eyes dull and shoulders slumped.</p><p>“Finally,” Rio said, her voice tired but light as she walked toward them with Alice at her side. Both women were pale, their movements slower than usual, but their determination was evident.</p><p>“Ready to get out of here?” Wanda asked with a small smile, stepping forward to help carry their bags.</p><p>“More than ready,” Alice muttered, adjusting her jacket. “Hospitals creep me out.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond, her focus shifting to Rio. “Are you sure you’re okay? Maybe we should stay a bit longer—”</p><p>“I’m fine, Aggie,” Rio interrupted gently, taking Agatha’s hand. “I promise.”</p><p>Agatha nodded but said nothing, her grip on Rio’s hand  tightening.</p><p>Back at Wanda’s house, the group settled in, the living room slowly coming to life with the sound of unpacking and quiet conversations. Wanda had prepared lunch earlier, but now the table was scattered with half-eaten plates and leftover containers. Agatha, moving to tidy up, frowned at the mess.</p><p>“Wanda,” she called, her voice sharper than intended. “Can you deal with this?” She gestured to the table.</p><p>Wanda looked up from where she was folding blankets on the couch. “What’s wrong with it?”</p><p>“The dishes,” Agatha said, her tone clipped. “They’ve been sitting here since lunch.”</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “I’ve been busy making sure everything else is handled. You could’ve done it if it bothered you so much.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened, her hands tightening into fists. “I’ve been running myself ragged trying to hold everything together, Wanda. The least you could do is clean up after yourself.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes narrowed, and she set the blankets down with a deliberate motion. “Don’t start with me, Agatha. We’re all tired. You’re not the only one dealing with everything.”</p><p>“Oh, really?” Agatha snapped, stepping closer. “Because it sure feels like I’m the one carrying the weight of this entire mess. Do you have any idea how much I’ve done to keep us afloat?”</p><p>“Don’t you dare,” Wanda shot back, her voice rising. “Do you think I haven’t been doing my part? I’ve been taking care of Billy, keeping this house running, and trying to make sure everyone is okay—including you.”</p><p>“Then why does it feel like I’m the only one who gives a damn about the details?” Agatha fired back, her voice shaking with suppressed anger.</p><p>“Because you’re obsessed with control!” Wanda shouted. “You can’t handle the idea of anyone else doing things differently, so you take it all on yourself and then blame us when you burn out!”</p><p>Agatha’s face flushed with anger, but her voice dropped, low and trembling. “Maybe I wouldn’t feel the need to control everything if I didn’t think it would all fall apart without me.”</p><p>Wanda stared at her, her jaw tightening. “That’s not fair, Agatha.”</p><p>“Neither is this,” Agatha snapped, gesturing to the table. “None of this is fair.”</p><p>The room fell silent for a moment, the tension thick and heavy. Agatha’s shoulders sagged, her anger giving way to exhaustion as tears welled in her eyes. “I’m sorry,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “I’m just...so tired, Wanda. I feel like I’m drowning.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression softened, and she stepped closer, her voice quieter now. “I know. I’m tired too, Aggie. We all are. But we’re in this together. You don’t have to do it all by yourself.”</p><p>Agatha wiped at her eyes, her hands shaking. “I just...I don’t know how much more I can take.”</p><p>Wanda reached out, pulling her into a hug. “We’ll get through this. But you have to let me help. Let all of us help.”</p><p>Agatha nodded against her shoulder, her tears spilling freely now. “Okay,” she whispered. “Okay.”</p><p>Later that evening, the house was quiet as everyone settled into their respective rooms. Agatha sat with Rio in their shared space, her head resting on Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“Long day?” Rio asked gently, her hand brushing through Agatha’s hair</p><p>“Long everything,” Agatha replied with a weak chuckle. “But...I think it’s going to be okay. Event ually. Wanda and I had...a moment.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “A good moment or a bad moment?”</p><p>“A bit of both,” Agatha admitted with a small chuckle. “But we worked it out.”</p><p>Rio reached for her hand, giving it a squeeze. “Good. You two need each other. We all do.”</p><p>Agatha leaned down, pressing a kiss to Rio’s forehead. “I know. I’m trying.”</p><p>Rio smiled up at her. “You’re doing just fine, Agatha. I promise.”</p><p>In the next room, Wanda tucked Billy into bed, her hand smoothing his hair as he drifted off. The fight with Agatha lingered in her mind, but so did the resolution. They were a team, fractured but unbroken, and they would face whatever came next together.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>It was late, and the house was silent save for the occasional creak of floorboards as the night settled in. Agatha sat at the small dining table in the corner of Wanda’s living room, her hands wrapped around a mug of tea that had long since gone cold. The day’s revelations swirled in her mind, a storm of emotions she couldn’t quite untangle.</p><p>Rio entered quietly, her movements careful and deliberate as she walked over and pulled out the chair across from Agatha. “Hey,” she said softly, her voice hoarse but steady. “Couldn’t sleep?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, not meeting Rio’s eyes. “Too much on my mind.”</p><p>Rio studied her for a moment before reaching out to take her hand. “Talk to me.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, her fingers curling around Rio’s instinctively. “Do you ever think about how we got here?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. “How we started as two strangers who couldn’t stand each other?”</p><p>Rio smirked faintly. “You mean how you thought I was a chaotic disaster, and I thought you were the most uptight person I’d ever met?”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft laugh, the sound tinged with sadness. “Yeah. That.”</p><p>“And now look at us,” Rio said, her tone teasing but warm. “We’re a team. A weird, dysfunctional team, but still.”</p><p>Agatha finally met Rio’s gaze, her eyes glistening. “It’s more than that, Rio. You’re...you’re everything to me.”</p><p>Rio’s teasing expression softened, her voice gentle. “And you’re everything to me, Aggie. So what’s really going on?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her throat tightening. “I’m scared,” she admitted, her voice breaking. “I’m scared that if we keep doing this—if we keep being together—you’re going to get hurt. Or worse.”</p><p>Rio frowned, squeezing her hand. “Aggie, what are you talking about?”</p><p>“Evanora,” Agatha said, her eyes welling with tears. “Even if we win, even if she goes to prison, she has people. People who will do whatever she tells them to. And you’ve already been through so much—more than anyone should have to.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, her free hand reaching to cup Agatha’s cheek. “And you think breaking up will make that better? You think I’ll be safer if I’m not with you?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha said, her voice trembling. “But I can’t lose you, Rio. I can’t.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, her thumb brushing away a tear that had slipped down Agatha’s cheek. “Agatha, listen to me. You’re not going to lose me. We’ve faced everything Evanora’s thrown at us so far, and we’re still standing.”</p><p>“But what if it’s not enough?” Agatha whispered. “What if one day she throws something we can’t handle?”</p><p>“Then we’ll deal with it,” Rio said firmly. “Together. You don’t have to protect me by yourself, Aggie. I’m not some fragile little thing you need to keep safe. I’m here because I choose to be, and I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath, her hand covering Rio’s. “I just...I don’t want to be the reason you get hurt.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, leaning in until their foreheads touched. “You’re not the reason, Aggie. You’re the reason I keep fighting. Don’t take that away from me.”</p><p>For a long moment, they sat in silence, their foreheads pressed together, their hands entwined. Agatha’s breathing gradually steadied, the warmth of Rio’s presence grounding her.</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha said finally, her voice steady but quiet. “I’ve never loved anyone the way I love you.”</p><p>Rio smiled, her voice soft but full of conviction. “And I love you. More than anything. So, please—stop trying to push me away. We’re in this together, Agatha. Always.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, a single tear slipping down her cheek. “Okay,” she whispered. “Together.”</p><p>Rio pulled her into a gentle embrace, holding her close as if to shield her from the weight of the world. For the first time in what felt like forever, Agatha allowed herself to believe that maybe—just maybe—they could face whatever came next.</p>

<p>The morning sunlight streamed through the hospital windows as Rio and Alice were finally discharged. Agatha and Wanda stood in the lobby, waiting to help their friends with bags and paperwork. Though there was relief in the air, a quiet tension had settled between the two women, unspoken but palpable.</p><p>Rio and Alice approached, both looking pale and tired but determined. Rio shot Agatha a faint smile as she leaned against her crutch, and Alice adjusted the strap of her bag. “Home never sounded so good,” Alice muttered.</p><p>“Let’s get you there,” Wanda said warmly, stepping forward to grab their bags.</p><p>Agatha said nothing, her lips pressed into a thin line as she glanced between Rio and Alice, her exhaustion threatening to overwhelm her. Rio noticed but didn’t comment, instead giving her hand a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>Back at Wanda’s house, the group settled in, the living room slowly coming to life with the sound of unpacking and quiet conversations. Wanda had prepared lunch earlier, but now the table was scattered with half-eaten plates and leftover containers. Agatha, moving to tidy up, frowned at the mess.</p><p>“Wanda,” she called, her voice sharper than intended. “Can you deal with this?” She gestured to the table.</p><p>Wanda looked up from where she was folding blankets on the couch. “What’s wrong with it?”</p><p>“The dishes,” Agatha said, her tone clipped. “They’ve been sitting here since lunch.”</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “I’ve been busy making sure everything else is handled. You could’ve done it if it bothered you so much.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened, her hands tightening into fists. “I’ve been running myself ragged trying to hold everything together, Wanda. The least you could do is clean up after yourself.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes narrowed, and she set the blankets down with a deliberate motion. “Don’t start with me, Agatha. We’re all tired. You’re not the only one dealing with everything.”</p><p>“Oh, really?” Agatha snapped, stepping closer. “Because it sure feels like I’m the one carrying the weight of this entire mess.

Agatha’s shoulders sagged, her anger giving way to exhaustion as tears welled in her eyes. “I’m sorry,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “I’m just...so tired, Wanda. I feel like I’m drowning.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression softened, and she stepped closer, her voice quieter now. “I know. I’m tired too, Aggie. We all are. But we’re in this together. You don’t have to do it all by yourself.”</p><p>Agatha wiped at her eyes, her hands shaking. “I just...I don’t know how much more I can take.”</p><p>Wanda reached out, pulling her into a hug. “We’ll get through this. But you have to let me help. Let all of us help.”</p><p>Agatha nodded against her shoulder, her tears spilling freely now. “Okay,” she whispered. “Okay.”</p><p>Later that evening, the house was quiet again. Wanda sat on the couch with Billy, the two of them engrossed in a comic book. Agatha was in the kitchen with Rio, helping her settle into a chair with a cup of tea.</p><p>“Everything okay?” Rio asked gently, her eyes searching Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly, brushing a hand through her hair. “Yeah. I think so. Wanda and I had...a moment.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “A good moment or a bad moment?”</p><p>“A bit of both,” Agatha admitted with a small chuckle. “But we worked it out.”</p><p>Rio reached for her hand, giving it a squeeze. “Good. You two need each other. We all do.”</p><p>Agatha leaned down, pressing a kiss to Rio’s forehead. “I know. I’m trying.”</p><p>Rio smiled up at her. “You’re doing just fine, Agatha, I promise.”</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>The clock ticked softly on the wall as the house remained still and quiet, save for the occasional creak of the floorboards settling. Rio stirred in her bed, her stomach twisting uncomfortably. A sharp pang shot through her, and she groaned, sitting up slowly. She placed a hand over her abdomen, grimacing.</p><p>“Great,” she muttered to herself. “Probably pushed too hard again.”</p><p>Carefully, she swung her legs over the side of the bed and stood, her movements slow and deliberate. Not wanting to disturb Agatha, who was sleeping soundly beside her, she slipped out of the room and made her way downstairs.</p><p>The faint glow of the kitchen light spilled into the living room as Rio padded softly into the space. She froze for a moment when she saw Wanda at the counter, pouring hot water into a mug.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said softly, clearing her throat. “Didn’t think anyone else would be up.”</p><p>Wanda glanced over, her expression tired but calm. “Join the club. Couldn’t sleep?”</p><p>“Not exactly,” Rio replied, moving to the cabinet to grab a mug. “Just feeling...off.”</p><p>They worked in companionable silence for a moment, the quiet hum of the electric kettle filling the space. Rio added honey to her tea while Wanda stirred hers idly, staring into the swirling liquid.</p><p>Rio leaned against the counter, studying Wanda’s profile. The normally sharp and composed woman looked worn down, her shoulders sagging slightly as she stared into her mug like it held answers to questions she hadn’t yet asked.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio asked softly, breaking the silence. “You’ve been...quiet since earlier.”</p><p>Wanda looked at her, surprised, before sighing. “I’m fine.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, her voice teasing but kind. “You know, when people say ‘I’m fine,’ it usually means they’re not.”</p><p>Wanda huffed a soft laugh, shaking her head. “You’re persistent, you know that?”</p><p>“Comes with the territory,” Rio replied with a small smile. “Seriously, though—what’s up?"</p><p>Wanda hesitated, her fingers tightening around her mug. “It’s this house,” she admitted finally, her voice quiet. “Being back here...it’s harder than I thought it would be.”</p><p>Rio frowned, setting her tea aside. “Because of your family?”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her gaze distant. “This house used to be so full of life. My parents, Pietro, me... It wasn’t perfect, but it was ours. And now...it just feels empty.”</p><p>Rio studied her, her heart aching for the pain Wanda carried. “Why didn’t you sell it?” she asked gently. “If it’s so hard to be here.”</p><p>Wanda shrugged, her lips twitching into a faint, sad smile. “I couldn’t. It’s all I have left of them. Selling it felt like letting them go. And I’m not ready for that.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, understanding in her gaze. “That makes sense. But it’s okay to feel overwhelmed, you know. It doesn’t make you weak.”</p><p>“I know,” Wanda said softly. “It’s just...this house was supposed to be a place for a family, and now it’s just me. And now Billy, I guess.”</p><p>Rio’s lips quirked into a faint smile. “Billy’s not ‘just Billy.’ He’s something special. And so are you, Wanda. You’ve given him something he’s never had before—a home.”</p><p>Wanda looked at Rio, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. “You think so?”</p><p>“I know so,” Rio replied firmly. “He looks at you like you hung the moon, Wanda. And you’ve earned it.”</p><p>The two women sat at the small kitchen table, their tea steaming between them. The heaviness of their conversation lingered, but there was a newfound sense of connection.</p><p>“You’re pretty good at this,” Wanda said after a moment, her voice lighter. “Talking people down. Offering perspective.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “I’ve had practice. Spent most of my life trying to talk Billy out of bad moods and worse decisions.”</p><p>Wanda smiled softly. “Well, you’re good at it. Thank you.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her expression softening. “Anytime.”</p><p>As the clock struck midnight, Wanda glanced at the time and sighed. “We should probably try to get some sleep.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio agreed, though her stomach still churned slightly. “Thanks for...talking.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Wanda said, standing and squeezing Rio’s shoulder gently. “Get some rest, and don’t overwork yourself tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, shaking her head. “No promises.”</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The sun was just beginning to rise, casting a soft golden glow over the house. Agatha stirred quietly, the faint hum of life returning to her as she pulled herself from bed. She glanced at Rio, still curled up under the blankets, her chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm. A small smile touched Agatha’s lips, but her heart ached at the thought of how close she’d come to losing her.</p><p>Making her way downstairs, Agatha found Jen already in the kitchen, a pan of eggs sizzling on the stove. “Morning,” Jen said, glancing over her shoulder. “You’re up early.”</p><p>“Habit,” Agatha replied, grabbing a mug and pouring herself some coffee. “And I figured I’d help. Cooking for everyone isn’t exactly a one-person job.”</p><p>Jen chuckled softly, moving aside to let Agatha start on the toast. “I appreciate it. It’s been a while since I’ve cooked for this many people.”</p><p>As they worked in companionable silence, Agatha glanced at Jen, noticing the faint shadows under her eyes and the tension in her shoulders. “How are you holding up?” Agatha asked gently.</p><p>Jen hesitated, her hands stilling for a moment as she cracked another egg into the pan. “I’m okay. I mean, as okay as I can be, considering everything.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, leaning against the counter. “This isn’t exactly your usual pace, huh? Chaos, danger, life-threatening accidents…”</p><p>Jen huffed a soft laugh, shaking her head. “Not exactly. I’m a med student, Aggie. I’m supposed to be the calm one in emergencies. But this? Watching Alice and Rio go through all of this, knowing how close we came to losing them...” Her voice trailed off, her throat tightening.</p><p>Agatha’s heart softened, and she reached out to squeeze Jen’s arm. “It’s different when it’s someone you care about.”</p><p>Jen nodded, her gaze dropping to the pan. “Alice means everything to me. And the thought of her not being here... I don’t even know how to process that... "</p><p>Agatha leaned back against the counter, her own coffee forgotten as memories of the past few days washed over her. “I know exactly how you feel,” she admitted, her voice quiet. “When I got that call about the accident, I couldn’t think. I couldn’t breathe. All I could imagine was Rio—hurt, or worse—and it was like the world just stopped.”</p><p>Jen looked at her, her expression softening. “It’s terrifying, isn’t it? Loving someone that much.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her throat tightening. “It is. Because the more you care, the more you have to lose.”</p><p>They stood in silence for a moment, the weight of their emotions hanging in the air. Finally, Jen spoke, her voice steady but soft. “But it’s worth it, isn’t it? The fear, the uncertainty... It’s all worth it for the moments you get with them.”</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly, her chest tightening with both love and fear. “Yeah. It is.”</p><p>The smell of eggs and toast filled the kitchen as the two women continued cooking, the quiet hum of their conversation easing the tension between them. Agatha handed Jen a plate of toast, her lips curving into a small smile. “You know, you’ve been incredible through all of this.”</p><p>Jen raised an eyebrow, her expression skeptical. “Incredible? I’ve been a wreck.”</p><p>“You’ve been strong,” Agatha corrected. “For Alice, for all of us. And that’s not easy, especially when you’re not used to this kind of...disaster.”</p><p>Jen chuckled softly, a hint of color rising to her cheeks. “Well, I learned from the best. You’re like a hurricane, Aggie, but in the best way.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, shaking her head. “I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p><p>“It is,” Jen assured her, her smile softening. “You’ve kept everyone together. Even when it felt like everything was falling apart.”</p><p>As they finished setting the table, Jen paused, her gaze turning serious. “We’re going to get through this, right?”</p><p>Agatha met her eyes, her voice firm. “We are. Because we have to. And because we’re not letting Evanora win.”</p><p>Jen nodded, her lips pressing into a thin line of determination. “Good. Because I’m not ready to lose anyone. Not Alice, not Rio, not you or Wanda or Billy.”</p><p>“And you won’t,” Agatha promised, her voice steady. “We’ve come too far to give up now.”</p><p>As the first rays of sunlight brightened the kitchen, the sound of footsteps echoed from upstairs. Wanda appeared in the doorway, her hair mussed from sleep, followed by a yawning Billy.</p><p>“Smells good,” Wanda said, her voice groggy but warm.</p><p>“Breakfast is ready,” Agatha said, gesturing to the table. “Eat up. It’s going to be a long day.”</p><p>As the house came to life, Agatha and Jen exchanged a small, knowing smile. The weight of their fears lingered, but so did their resilience. </p><p>The sun had fully risen by the time Agatha climbed the stairs, a tray in her hands laden with breakfast for two. The smell of freshly brewed coffee and warm toast wafted through the air as she nudged the bedroom door open with her hip. Rio was still nestled under the blankets, her hair a messy halo on the pillow.</p><p>“Good morning, trouble,” Agatha greeted softly, setting the tray down on the bedside table. “I brought breakfast.”</p><p>Rio stirred, her eyes fluttering open. A lazy smile spread across her face as she saw Agatha standing there. “Mmm, breakfast in bed? What did I do to deserve this?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, leaning down to kiss Rio’s forehead. “You survived a car crash and didn’t drive me completely insane this week. I figured you earned it.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, sitting up slightly as Agatha handed her a cup of coffee. “You’re too good to me.”</p><p>As Agatha sat beside her, cutting into her plate of eggs, Rio shifted closer, her coffee set aside on the table. “You know,” she began, her voice low and teasing, “I can think of another way to start the morning.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, raising an eyebrow. “Oh?”</p><p>Rio leaned in, brushing a kiss against the curve of Agatha’s neck. Her hand slipped under the edge of Agatha’s shirt, her fingers tracing soft patterns along her skin. “Yeah,” she murmured, her lips moving against Agatha’s throat. “Something a little more...fun.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, her cheeks flushing as Rio’s kisses deepened, her hand sliding higher. “Rio,” she started, her voice faltering.</p><p>“What?” Rio asked innocently, though her smirk betrayed her. “I’m just trying to show my appreciation.”</p><p>Agatha caught Rio’s wandering hand, intertwining their fingers. “I know what you’re trying to do,” she said, her voice soft but firm. “And as much as I love you...now’s not the time.”</p><p>Rio pouted, leaning back slightly. “You’re no fun.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, pressing a kiss to Rio’s lips. “I promise, once all of this is over, you can seduce me as much as you want. But right now, we need to focus.”</p><p>Rio sighed dramatically, though her eyes sparkled with amusement. “Fine. But you owe me, Harkness.”</p><p>“Deal,” Agatha said with a grin, handing Rio her plate of food. “Now eat your breakfast.”</p><p>Down the hall, Jen carried a tray into Alice’s room, balancing it carefully as she nudged the door open with her elbow. Alice was propped up against the headboard, her laptop on her lap as usual, though she looked tired.</p><p>“Good morning, workaholic,” Jen said, setting the tray on the bedside table. “Thought you might need some fuel.”</p><p>Alice looked up, a small smile curving her lips. “You’re spoiling me.”</p><p>“Someone has to,” Jen replied, sitting on the edge of the bed and handing Alice a mug of tea. “You’re impossible when you’re hungry.”</p><p>Alice laughed softly, setting her laptop aside. “You’re not wrong.”</p><p>They ate together in comfortable silence, the tension of the past days momentarily forgotten. After a while, Alice glanced at Jen, her expression softening. “You’re amazing, you know that?”</p><p>Jen shrugged, though her cheeks flushed faintly. “I’m just taking care of you.”</p><p>“And I love you for it,” Alice said, leaning over to kiss her cheek.</p><p>Jen smiled, her heart swelling. “Good. Because I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Back in Agatha and Rio’s room, the tray of food sat half-forgotten as they leaned against each other, the stress of the past week giving way to a rare moment of peace.</p><p>“You know,” Rio said, her voice thoughtful, “for all the chaos, I wouldn’t trade this for anything. Being here, with you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, resting her head on Rio’s shoulder. “Me neither. But let’s survive the trial first before we start planning our happily ever after.”</p><p>“Deal,” Rio said, lacing their fingers together. “But after that, you’re all mine.”</p><p>“Always,” Agatha replied softly, her voice full of promise.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The house buzzed with activity as everyone worked on their respective tasks. Papers covered the dining table, laptops were open on the couches, and the sound of furious typing and quiet discussions filled the air. It had been a productive, albeit exhausting, morning.</p><p>Around lunchtime, the doorbell rang, breaking the rhythm of their work. Everyone froze, their heads snapping toward the sound.</p><p>“Who could that be?” Rio muttered, glancing at Agatha. “No one knows we’re here.”</p><p>Wanda wiped her hands on a dish towel as she made her way to the door, her brow furrowed with concern. She opened it cautiously, ready for anything.</p><p>Standing on the doorstep was Lilia Calderu, smiling warmly with her arms full of pizza boxes stacked nearly to her chin. Behind her, a delivery driver wheeled in a cart holding more boxes.</p><p>“Lilia?” Wanda asked, blinking in surprise. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Lilia stepped inside, gesturing for the delivery driver to bring in the rest. “Thought I’d bring lunch,” she said casually. “And not just any lunch—pizza. Ten boxes, one of each kind. Something for everyone.”</p><p>The smell of freshly baked pizza filled the air as Lilia set the boxes on the kitchen counter, grinning at the wide-eyed stares from everyone in the room. Agatha crossed her arms, smirking. “How did you know where to find us? Wanda’s house is practically off the grid.”</p><p>Lilia turned, her expression smug. “I have friends everywhere, Agatha. Tracking Wanda down wasn’t easy, but it wasn’t impossible.”</p><p>Wanda narrowed her eyes but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at her lips. “I should’ve known you’d find me. But why go to all this trouble?”</p><p>“Because you all look like you haven’t had a proper meal in days,” Lilia said matter-of-factly. “And because I figured a little morale boost wouldn’t hurt.”</p><p>Billy peeked around the corner, his eyes lighting up when he saw the pizza. “Ten boxes? Are you serious?”</p><p>Lilia grinned, ruffling his hair as he approached. “Very serious. Dig in, kid.”</p><p>The group gathered in the dining room, the tension from the morning’s work temporarily forgotten as they opened box after box of pizza. There was something for everyone: classic pepperoni, veggie lovers, meat lovers, Hawaiian, and even a plain cheese for Billy, who declared it “the best pizza ever.”</p><p>“This is amazing,” Rio said, her voice muffled by a mouthful of supreme pizza. “Lilia, you’re officially my favorite person.”</p><p>“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Lilia replied, sipping from a glass of water. “But don’t get too comfortable. We’ve still got work to do.”</p><p>Wanda smirked, leaning back in her chair. “You say that as if you’re not the one who brought enough food to feed a small army.”</p><p>“Strategic planning requires sustenance,” Lilia said with a wink.</p><p>As the meal wound down, Wanda leaned closer to Lilia, her expression curious. “Seriously, though—how did you find me?”</p><p>Lilia smiled knowingly, leaning back in her chair. “I have my ways, Wanda. Let’s just say I called in a few favors.”</p><p>“Favors?” Wanda raised an eyebrow. “From who?”</p><p>“Let’s just say I know people who know people,” Lilia replied cryptically. “Your house was harder to find than most, but not impossible.”</p><p>Wanda studied her for a moment before shaking her head with a small laugh. “You’re something else, Lilia.”</p><p>“And don’t you forget it,” Lilia said with a grin.</p><p>After lunch, the group felt noticeably lighter, their energy renewed by the unexpected feast. Agatha caught Lilia’s arm as she started to leave, her expression grateful.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said softly. “For everything.”</p><p>Lilia smiled, her gaze warm. “You’ve got enough on your plate, Agatha. Let me take care of a little bit of it.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her throat tight. “We’ll get through this. Together.”</p><p>As the door closed behind her, the group returned to their tasks, their spirits lifted. They were still tired, still overwhelmed, but for the first time in days, hope didn’t feel so far out of reach.</p><p>~~~</p><p>The living room was filled with quiet chatter as the group worked on various tasks, but Billy sat on the couch, his phone in hand, his focus entirely elsewhere. After the lunch Lilia had brought, he had made up his mind: if Evanora was funding conversion camps, he was going to find someone who could help expose her.</p><p>He opened Instagram, scrolling through the accounts of LGBTQ+ groups he’d joined over the past few months. His fingers hovered over the keyboard, hesitant at first. What if no one wanted to talk? What if they thought he was being intrusive?</p><p>He shook off the doubt and typed out a message: "Hey, I’m Billy, and I’m working on something really important. If anyone has been affected by conversion camps or knows someone who has, I’d love to talk. It’s about holding the people funding them accountable. DM me if you’re comfortable sharing."</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he hit “send” and watched as the message was shared across several group chats and stories.</p><p>Hours passed, and Billy had almost given up hope when his phone pinged. A direct message. His heart raced as he opened it.</p><p>Tommy Shepherd: Hey. I saw your post. I...I don’t know if I can help, but I’ve been to one of those camps. It sucked. What do you need?</p><p>Billy’s fingers hovered over the screen, his mind racing. He started typing quickly, his heart pounding.</p><p>Billy: Thanks for reaching out. I’m working with some people who are trying to take down the people funding those camps. I know it’s a lot to ask, but would you be willing to share your story? Even anonymously?</p><p>The typing indicator appeared almost immediately.</p><p>Tommy: I don’t know. It’s not something I like talking about. But if it means stopping those places, maybe. Can I ask who’s behind this?</p><p>Billy hesitated. He didn’t want to scare Tommy away by overloading him with details.</p><p>Billy: It’s a long story, but there’s someone really powerful funding them. We’re trying to expose them in court. Your story could make a huge difference.</p><p>The response took longer this time, and Billy chewed on his lip nervously. Finally, Tommy replied.</p><p>Tommy: Okay. I’ll think about it. Can we talk more tomorrow?</p><p>Billy: Of course. Anytime you’re ready.</p><p>Tommy’s next message was unexpected.</p><p>Tommy: Thanks for doing this. Most people don’t care.</p><p>Billy’s throat tightened as he typed his response.</p><p>Billy: I care. And I promise, we’re going to stop them.</p><p>Billy sat back, exhaling deeply. The first step had been taken, but he knew this was just the beginning. He found Wanda in the kitchen, stirring a pot of soup on the stove.</p><p>“Wanda?” he asked hesitantly.</p><p>She turned, raising an eyebrow. “What’s up, Teen?”</p><p>“I, uh...I did something,” Billy said, fiddling with the edge of his shirt. “I reached out to some groups online to find people who’ve been to conversion camps.”</p><p>Wanda froze, her eyes searching his face. “And?”</p><p>“I found someone,” Billy said, his voice growing stronger. “A boy named Tommy. He’s my age, and he went to one of those camps. He said he might be willing to share his story.”</p><p>Wanda set down the spoon, stepping closer. “Billy, that’s amazing. But are you sure this is something you’re ready to handle?”</p><p>Billy nodded. “I know it’s heavy, but...I have to do something, Wanda. If we can stop Evanora from hurting more kids like Tommy, it’ll all be worth it.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes softened, and she pulled Billy into a hug. “I’m proud of you, Teen. But if this gets too much, you tell me, okay?”</p><p>“Okay,” Billy promised, his voice muffled against her shoulder. “But I’m not backing down.”</p><p>That evening, Billy sat at the dining table with his phone in hand, occasionally glancing at his messages. Agatha and Rio noticed his distracted demeanor and exchanged a glance.</p><p>“What’s up, Teen?” Rio asked, leaning her chin on her hand. “You’ve been glued to that phone all day.”</p><p>Billy hesitated before sharing what he’d done. By the time he finished, Rio was grinning proudly.</p><p>“That’s incredible,” Rio said, reaching over to ruffle his hair. “You’re a badass, you know that?”</p><p>Billy flushed but smiled. “I just hope it helps.”</p><p>Agatha leaned forward, her expression thoughtful. “If Tommy agrees to testify or even provide a statement, it could be a turning point. But we have to be careful—he’ll need protection.”</p><p>Wanda nodded. “We’ll take it one step at a time. But Billy’s right—this could change everything.”</p><p>The house buzzed quietly with focused energy as everyone worked on their respective tasks. Alice sat cross-legged on a guest bed in Wanda’s house, her laptop balanced on her knees. Jen leaned against the headboard beside her, reading through notes on her tablet.</p><p>“Anything new?” Jen asked, not looking up.</p><p>Alice frowned, her fingers flying across the keyboard. “Possibly. I just got emails from two former employees of one of Evanora’s companies—Jeff and Rebecca. They claim they want to testify against her.”</p><p>Jen glanced at Alice, raising an eyebrow. “That sounds...convenient.”</p><p>“My thoughts exactly,” Alice muttered, opening the emails. “Listen to this:”</p><p>Jeff: I worked for her subsidiary for three years. I saw things—money being funneled to accounts that didn’t make sense, sudden layoffs for people who asked too many questions. I want to help.</p><p>Rebecca: Evanora’s companies ruin lives. I know what she’s done, and I can’t stay silent anymore. I just need to know I’ll be safe.</p><p>Alice leaned back, staring at the screen. “It sounds legit, but after everything with Ralph…”</p><p>Jen placed her tablet aside, her hand resting on Alice’s knee. “You’re worried about being betrayed again.”</p><p>Alice nodded, her throat tightening. “We can’t afford another Ralph situation, Jen. But if they’re telling the truth, this could be huge.”</p><p>Jen gave her a reassuring squeeze. “Then let’s figure it out together. No one gets a free pass—not even these two.”</p><p>Alice sent emails to both Jeff and Rebecca, asking for a video call. Within minutes, both responded, agreeing to talk.</p><p>As the call connected, Jeff appeared first, his face drawn and pale, his eyes darting nervously. He was in his late thirties, and his constant fidgeting set Alice on edge. Rebecca joined a moment later, her expression calm and composed. She seemed younger, perhaps in her early thirties, with a determined glint in her eyes.</p><p>“Thanks for agreeing to talk,” Alice began, her tone steady. “I hope you understand why I’m being cautious.”</p><p>“Of course,” Jeff said quickly, his voice shaky. “I’d be suspicious, too.”</p><p>“We’re here because we want to help,” Rebecca added, her tone firm. “Evanora has done enough damage, and it’s time someone stood up to her.”</p><p>Alice nodded, studying their faces. “Can you tell me why now? Why are you coming forward at this moment?”</p><p>Rebecca answered without hesitation. “Because we’re tired of being scared. We’ve seen what she’s capable of, and it’s time someone fought back.”</p><p>Jeff nodded but didn’t add anything, his gaze flitting between his screen and something off-camera.</p><p>As the call continued, Rebecca provided detailed accounts of her time at one of Evanora’s subsidiaries. Her stories of financial misconduct and hostile work environments were precise, and she even offered to send supporting documents.</p><p>Jeff, on the other hand, was vague and evasive when Alice pressed for specifics. He grew defensive, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>When the call ended, Alice turned to Jen, who had been watching silently. “What do you think?”</p><p>Jen frowned, crossing her arms. “Rebecca seems solid. But Jeff? He’s either scared out of his mind or hiding something.”</p><p>Alice sighed, her shoulders slumping. “I think you’re right. Rebecca’s details line up with what we already know, but Jeff...he feels off.”</p><p>Jen placed a comforting hand on Alice’s back. “You don’t have to decide right now. Let’s see what Rebecca sends. If Jeff is lying, we’ll figure it out.”</p><p>Alice nodded, her jaw tightening. “I just don’t want to waste any more time on dead ends.”</p><p>Down the hall, Billy was curled up on the couch, typing furiously on his phone as he chatted with Tommy.</p><p>“Billy’s been at that for hours,” Jen said, glancing at the living room from Alice’s room. “He’s really stepping up.”</p><p>Alice smiled faintly. “He’s a good kid. I just hope he’s not taking on too much.”</p><p>“Sounds familiar,” Jen teased, nudging Alice gently. “You two are more alike than you think.”</p><p>Alice laughed softly but didn’t deny it.</p><p>Later that evening, the group gathered in the living room to compare notes. Billy shared his progress with Tommy, while Alice updated everyone on her calls with Jeff and Rebecca.</p><p>“I trust Rebecca,” Alice said firmly. “She’s already sent me documents that back up her claims. Jeff...I’m still on the fence.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, leaning forward. “What about Tommy?”</p><p>Billy hesitated before answering. “He’s not ready to share his story yet. But I think he will be. He just needs time.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her expression thoughtful. “It sounds like we’re making progress. Slowly, but surely.”</p><p>“We just have to keep going,” Agatha said, her voice steady. “Evanora’s counting on us to give up. Let’s prove her wrong.”</p><p>~~~~</p><p>In one of Wanda’s guest rooms, Agatha and Rio sat across from each other, a pile of documents and laptops between them. Agatha worked diligently, her pen scratching across the paper as she reviewed notes. Rio, on the other hand, struggled to focus. Her body ached relentlessly, and every attempt to concentrate left her feeling more drained.</p><p>Her legs felt heavy, her back sore from sitting too long. A faint dizziness lingered at the edges of her mind, making her head swim if she moved too quickly. She clenched her jaw, forcing herself to sit upright and keep going.</p><p>Agatha glanced up, her sharp eyes catching the tension in Rio’s posture. “You sure you’re okay?” she asked softly.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replied too quickly, not meeting Agatha’s gaze. “Just tired.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment but decided not to press. “If you say so.”</p><p>The sound of the doorbell startled them both. Agatha frowned, setting her pen down. “Were we expecting anyone?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Probably more pizza or something.”</p><p>Minutes later, Jen appeared in the doorway, smiling sheepishly. “Hey, sorry to interrupt. My friend Claire is here. She’s a physiotherapist, and I asked her to help Rio with some exercises.”</p><p>Rio tensed, her brows furrowing. “I don’t need—”</p><p>“Yes, you do,” Agatha interjected firmly, standing up. “No arguments, Rio. You’ve been pushing yourself too hard, and this will help.”</p><p>Before Rio could protest further, Claire entered the room. She was petite, with a confident smile and a calming presence. “Hi, Rio. Ready to get started?”</p><p>Rio sighed, her shoulders slumping. “Do I have a choice?”</p><p>Claire guided Rio to the center of the room, where she had set up a yoga mat. “We’ll keep it simple,” she said kindly. “Just some stretches and balance exercises to loosen up your muscles and help with your recovery.”</p><p>“Balance?” Rio raised an eyebrow. “I can walk just fine.”</p><p>“It’s not about walking,” Claire explained. “It’s about control and stability. Let’s start with a single-leg stand. Just lift one foot a few inches off the ground and hold it for ten seconds.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but complied, lifting her left foot slightly. Her leg wobbled almost immediately, and she had to put her foot back down to avoid toppling over.</p><p>“Let’s try again,” Claire encouraged. “Take your time.”</p><p>Rio tried several more times, but each attempt ended the same way—unsteady, shaky, and frustratingly short-lived. Her frustration grew with every failure.</p><p>After several unsuccessful attempts, Claire suggested another exercise: a standing forward bend. “It’s simple,” she said. “Just bend forward and touch your toes. It’ll help stretch your back and legs.”</p><p>Rio tried, but her muscles screamed in protest. She barely made it halfway down before she had to straighten up, her face flushed with frustration.</p><p>“This is ridiculous,” she muttered, crossing her arms. “I can’t do anything right.”</p><p>“Rio,” Claire said gently, “your body is still healing. These things take time.”</p><p>Rio turned away, her fists clenching at her sides. “Time I don’t have.”</p><p>As Claire packed up her equipment, Rio sank onto the edge of the bed, her shoulders hunched. Agatha approached cautiously, sitting beside her. “Hey,” she said softly. “It’s okay to be frustrated, but—”</p><p>“Don’t,” Rio snapped, cutting her off. “Don’t try to sugarcoat this, Agatha. I can’t even do basic stretches without falling apart. How am I supposed to be useful to anyone?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed, her voice calm but firm. “You’re not useless, Rio. You’re recovering. That’s not the same thing.”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped toward her, anger flashing in her eyes. “Easy for you to say. You’re not the one stuck like this, feeling like a goddamn failure.”</p><p>Agatha flinched but kept her composure. “I’m not trying to make light of this, Rio. I just don’t want you to give up.”</p><p>“Maybe I’m just realistic,” Rio shot back, standing abruptly. “Not everyone bounces back. Some of us don’t get to be perfect.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips tightened, her eyes darkening with hurt. “You think I’m perfect? You have no idea what I’ve been through to get here.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond, her chest heaving as she tried to control her emotions. The silence between them was heavy, charged with unspoken tension.</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha said quietly, standing. “If you want to wallow in self-pity, I can’t stop you. But don’t push me away when all I’m trying to do is help.”</p><p>She turned and left the room, leaving Rio alone with her thoughts.</p><p>Rio sat back on the bed, her fists clenching and unclenching. Her body hurt, her pride was wounded, and now she’d driven Agatha away. The anger inside her simmered, directed as much at herself as at the world around her.</p><p>For now, she let the silence swallow her whole, unsure of how—or even if—she would make things right.</p>

<p>The smell of roasted chicken and garlic wafted through the house as Wanda set the dining table in the living room, arranging dishes of sides and drinks with precision. Jen and Alice helped bring plates and utensils, while Billy hovered nearby, sneaking bites of bread when he thought no one was looking.</p><p>Agatha appeared from the hallway, her expression tense but controlled. “Everyone’s almost ready?” she asked, her gaze sweeping the room.</p><p>“Just waiting on Rio,” Wanda replied, glancing toward the stairs. “You think she’s okay?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips tightened. “She’s...having a rough day.”</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow but said nothing, turning back to the table. Agatha sighed and headed toward the stairs.</p><p>Agatha knocked gently on the door to their guest room. “Rio? Dinner’s ready. We’re all meeting in the living room.”</p><p>There was a pause before Rio’s muffled voice answered, “I’m not really hungry. You guys go ahead.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “You should eat. And we need to go over everyone’s findings.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio replied quickly. “I just...I need to take a shower. Which, as you know, now takes forever.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her frustration bubbling beneath the surface. “Rio, you’ve been in here all evening. You can’t avoid everyone forever.”</p><p>“I’m not avoiding anyone,” Rio snapped back. “I just need a little time. Okay?”</p><p>Agatha stared at the closed door for a moment, debating whether to push further. Finally, she sighed. “Fine. But don’t stay in here all night.”</p><p>“Noted,” Rio said flatly.</p><p>Agatha returned to the living room, her expression tight as she sat down beside Wanda. “She’s not coming,” she announced, grabbing a piece of chicken.</p><p>“What’s her excuse?” Jen asked, her tone light but curious.</p><p>“Apparently, showers are now a full-time job,” Agatha muttered, stabbing her fork into a roasted potato.</p><p>Wanda gave her a look. “Agatha, go easy on her. She’s been through a lot.”</p><p>“We’ve all been through a lot,” Agatha retorted. “And I get it—she’s frustrated. But shutting everyone out isn’t helping.”</p><p>Billy, sitting cross-legged on the couch, spoke up hesitantly. “Maybe she just needs a little space. I mean, sometimes it’s hard to deal with everything all at once.”</p><p>Alice nodded, her voice thoughtful. “Billy’s right. And Rio’s not the type to sit still, so being forced to...it’s probably eating her alive.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, leaning back in her chair. “I know. I just wish she’d talk to me instead of hiding.”</p><p>The group shifted focus to their findings, with Alice sharing updates from her conversations with Rebecca and Jeff, and Billy describing his ongoing talks with Tommy. Jen chimed in with insights from her medical connections, while Wanda outlined potential next steps for the trial.</p><p>Despite the productive conversation, Agatha’s mind kept drifting to Rio. Her absence felt like a weight in the room, a reminder of the cracks forming between them.</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda said, snapping her out of her thoughts. “Are you with us?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha replied quickly. “Just...thinking.”</p><p>Wanda studied her for a moment before nodding. “We’ll figure it out,” she said quietly, her tone reassuring.</p><p>Upstairs, Rio sat on the edge of the bed, staring at her reflection in the mirror. Her damp hair clung to her neck, and her muscles still ached from earlier. She felt like a stranger in her own body, every small failure amplifying her frustration.</p><p>The sound of muffled laughter and conversation from downstairs made her chest tighten. She knew she should be with them, contributing, being part of the team. But the thought of facing everyone, of feeling like a burden again, was too much to bear.</p><p>“I’ll join them tomorrow,” she murmured to herself, though the words rang hollow.</p><p>For now, she let the silence of the room wrap around her, hoping it would dull the ache inside.</p><h3>~~~~~~</h3><p>The lively discussion in the living room came to an abrupt halt when a loud thud echoed from upstairs. Everyone froze, their eyes darting toward the ceiling.</p><p>“What was that?” Wanda asked, her voice sharp with concern.</p><p>Agatha was already out of her chair, her heart pounding. “It came from our bathroom,” she said, rushing toward the stairs. The others exchanged worried glances, but none dared follow, sensing that this was something Agatha needed to handle alone.</p><p>When Agatha pushed open the bathroom door, the sight before her made her breath hitch. Rio was slumped on the shower floor, fully clothed and soaked, her knees pulled to her chest as the water continued to pour over her. Her body trembled with sobs, her face buried in her hands.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed, stepping inside. She turned off the water and crouched beside her. “What happened? Are you hurt?”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond, shaking her head as she cried harder. Agatha’s chest tightened at the sight of her so vulnerable, so broken.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio finally choked out, her voice barely audible. “Just leave me alone.”</p><p>“You’re not fine,” Agatha said firmly, her own voice trembling. “And I’m not leaving you like this.”</p><p>Agatha reached out to help Rio up, but Rio flinched away, her wet hands slipping against the tiled floor. “Don’t,” she said weakly. “I don’t need your help.”</p><p>“Yes, you do,” Agatha insisted, her voice breaking. She reached for Rio again, her movements gentle but determined. “Please, Rio. Let me help you.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, her sobs growing louder. “I can’t... I can’t even stand up. I can’t do anything right. I’m useless.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart shattered at those words. Tears spilled down her cheeks as she knelt fully on the wet floor, wrapping her arms around Rio despite her protests. “Stop,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “Stop saying that. You’re not useless. You’re not.”</p><p>Rio squirmed in her grasp, trying to pull away, but Agatha held her tight. “Let go of me,” Rio sobbed. “Just let me be.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Agatha said firmly, her voice rising with emotion. “I love you, Rio. Even when you don’t love yourself, I love you.”</p><p>Those words seemed to pierce through Rio’s resistance. She stopped struggling, her sobs subsiding into broken gasps. Agatha loosened her grip just enough to pull back and meet Rio’s tear-streaked gaze.</p><p>“I’ve got you,” Agatha said softly, her own tears falling freely. “You don’t have to do this alone. You don’t have to carry all this pain by yourself.”</p><p>Rio’s lip quivered, and she let out a shaky breath. “I don’t know how to be okay, Agatha. I don’t know how to fix this.”</p><p>“You don’t have to fix it,” Agatha said, brushing wet strands of hair from Rio’s face. “We’ll figure it out together. One step at a time. But you have to let me in.”</p><p>Rio nodded weakly, her head dropping against Agatha’s shoulder. Agatha cradled her there for a long moment, her sobs mingling with Rio’s as they clung to each other.</p><p>When Rio’s breathing evened out, Agatha pulled back slightly, cupping her face. “Let’s get you out of these wet clothes, okay? You’ll feel better.”</p><p>Rio hesitated but eventually nodded, her movements sluggish as Agatha helped her to her feet. She guided her into the bedroom, grabbing a towel and wrapping it around her before finding dry clothes.</p><p>As Agatha helped her change, Rio whispered, “You don’t have to do this.”</p><p>“Yes, I do,” Agatha said softly. “Because I love you. And because you’d do the same for me.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes filled with tears again, but she didn’t protest. She let Agatha pull a warm sweater over her head and guide her to the bed.</p><p>Once Rio was settled, Agatha sat beside her, her hand resting on hers. “You don’t have to be strong all the time, Rio,” she said gently. “It’s okay to lean on me. That’s what we’re here for.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, her expression weary but grateful. “Thank you,” she whispered. “For not giving up on me.”</p><p>“Never,” Agatha replied, her voice steady despite the tears still lingering in her eyes. “Not in a million years.”</p><h3>~~~~~~~</h3><p>The house was silent, the only sound the faint hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen. Rio shuffled in, her hair tousled and her steps quiet. Her stomach had finally rebelled against her earlier stubbornness, demanding to be fed.</p><p>She grabbed a loaf of bread from the counter and popped two slices into the toaster. The warm glow of the kitchen light and the smell of toasting bread were oddly comforting in the stillness of the night.</p><p>As she reached for the butter, the soft creak of footsteps broke the silence. Turning, she saw Alice stepping into the kitchen, her expression weary and her eyes shadowed with fatigue.</p><p>“Couldn’t sleep?” Rio asked, her voice hushed.</p><p>Alice shook her head, rubbing her arms. “Nightmares,” she admitted softly. “About the accident. You?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, avoiding Alice’s gaze. “Just hungry.”</p><p>Alice moved to the counter, grabbing a glass and filling it with water. She leaned against the sink, studying Rio for a moment. “You okay?” she asked.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said quickly, her tone too light to be convincing. She focused on spreading butter over her toast, keeping her eyes down. “Just tired.”</p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow, her lips pressing into a thin line. “You’re a terrible liar, you know that?”</p><p>Rio glanced at her, a faint smirk tugging at her lips. “And you’re too nosy.”</p><p>“Comes with the territory,” Alice replied, her voice gentle. “Seriously, though. What’s going on?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her hands stilling. She wanted to brush Alice off, to pretend everything was fine, but the weight in her chest was too heavy to carry alone. With a sigh, she set her toast down and leaned against the counter.</p><p>“It’s just...everything,” Rio admitted, her voice quiet. “I’m so tired, Alice. Tired of feeling like this. Tired of failing at everything. Tired of not being...enough.”</p><p>Alice’s heart ached at the vulnerability in Rio’s voice. She set her glass down and crossed the room, standing beside her. “Rio, you’ve been through hell. No one expects you to bounce back overnight.”</p><p>“That’s the problem,” Rio said bitterly, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. “I don’t even know if I can bounce back. What if this is just...who I am now?”</p><p>Alice placed a hand on her shoulder, her grip firm and reassuring. “You’re not broken, Rio. You’re healing. And healing takes time. No one’s judging you for that.”</p><p>Rio let out a shaky breath, her fingers gripping the edge of the counter. “It’s not just that. Agatha...she’s been so amazing through all of this, and I feel like I’m letting her down. Like I’m holding her back.”</p><p>Alice frowned, her hand squeezing Rio’s shoulder. “Agatha loves you. She’s not thinking about what you’re ‘not doing.’ She’s thinking about how to help you, how to be there for you. And honestly? You’d do the same for her in a heartbeat.”</p><p>Rio looked at Alice, her eyes searching. “How do you do it?” she asked softly. “How do you keep going after something like the accident? I can’t even shower without falling apart.”</p><p>Alice hesitated, her gaze dropping to the floor. “I don’t know if I am,” she admitted. “Every time I close my eyes, I see the crash. I feel the impact. It’s like it’s still happening, over and over.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened at the confession, the pain in Alice’s voice cutting through her own despair. “I didn’t know,” she said quietly. “You always seem so...together.”</p><p>“That’s the trick,” Alice said with a weak smile. “You fake it until you start believing it yourself. But it’s exhausting.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her own pain mirrored in Alice’s words. “I guess we’re both a mess, huh?”</p><p>“Pretty much,” Alice replied, her smile growing. “But we’re not alone. That’s what matters.”</p><p>They sat at the kitchen table, sharing the toast Rio had made. The silence between them was comfortable, the tension of the night easing slightly.</p><p>“Thanks for talking to me,” Rio said eventually, her voice soft. “I didn’t realize how much I needed it.”</p><p>“Anytime,” Alice replied, her tone warm. “And, Rio? You’re stronger than you think. Don’t forget that.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, her chest feeling a little lighter. “You too, Alice. We’ve got this.”</p><p>Alice nodded, her confidence bolstered by the shared moment.<br/><br/><br/><em>Meanwhile at Billy's room</em><br/><br/></p><p>Billy lay on his bed, his phone screen glowing in the dimly lit room. The house was quiet, save for the occasional creak of the floorboards and the distant hum of Wanda typing in her makeshift study next door. His stomach churned with nervous energy as he typed out another message on Instagram.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> <em>Hey, I know it’s late, but I just wanted to check in. How’re you feeling?</em></p><p>The typing indicator appeared almost instantly.</p><p><strong>Tommy:</strong> <em>Not great. Nightmares again. You?</em></p><p>Billy hesitated before replying. He didn’t want to dump his own baggage, not when Tommy was already dealing with so much.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> <em>Same. But hey, we’re still here, right? That’s something.</em></p><p><strong>Tommy:</strong> <em>Barely. Some days, it doesn’t feel like enough.</em></p><p>Billy’s heart sank. He took a deep breath before typing his next message.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> <em>I get it. Really, I do. But it helps to talk. Even if it’s just to me.</em></p><p><strong>Tommy:</strong> <em>You’re not like most people. Most people don’t care.</em></p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> <em>I care. And I think we could help each other. Wanna meet up? Somewhere public. Just to talk.</em></p><p>The typing indicator paused for a long time, and Billy’s nerves stretched taut. Finally, the response came.</p><p><strong>Tommy:</strong> <em>I don’t know. What if it’s weird?</em></p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> <em>It won’t be. I promise. I’ll even bring my...kind of mom. She’s cool. No pressure, though.</em></p><p>There was another long pause before Tommy replied.</p><p><strong>Tommy:</strong> <em>Okay. Just a coffee shop or something?</em></p><p>Billy smiled, relief flooding him.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> <em>Yeah. There’s a little café near where I’m staying. Tomorrow at 10?</em></p><p><strong>Tommy:</strong> <em>Fine. But if you turn out to be some weirdo, I’m running.</em></p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> <em>Fair enough. But you’re not getting rid of me that easily.</em></p><p>~~~~~</p><p>The smell of freshly brewed coffee and pancakes wafted through the house as the group gathered in the living room for breakfast. Wanda had set up the coffee table with plates of food, mugs, and a jug of orange juice, while Billy balanced a stack of pancakes precariously on his plate.</p><p>“Careful, Teen,” Wanda teased, sipping her coffee. “That plate’s about to topple over.”</p><p>Billy grinned, taking a big bite of pancake. “Worth it.”</p><p>Alice sat cross-legged on the couch, looking more rested than the previous night. Jen joined her, handing over a steaming cup of tea before helping herself to the platter of scrambled eggs. Agatha, sitting in an armchair with her own plate, glanced toward the stairs.</p><p>“She’s not coming, is she?” Agatha asked quietly.</p><p>Wanda followed her gaze, her smile fading. “Rio?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her expression tight. “She didn’t sleep well. She’s been having nightmares. And now she’s avoiding everyone again.”</p><p>Alice exchanged a glance with Jen, remembering their conversation in the kitchen. “She’s struggling,” Alice said softly. “Last night, we talked for a bit. She’s feeling overwhelmed. Like she’s failing.”</p><p>“She’s not failing,” Wanda said firmly. “She’s recovering. There’s a difference.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, running a hand through her hair. “She doesn’t see it that way. And I don’t know how to make her believe it.”</p><p>Upstairs, Rio sat on the edge of her bed, staring at the floor. Her body felt heavy, her limbs sluggish. Sleep had been elusive, plagued by vivid nightmares that left her gasping awake in the early hours of the morning.</p><p>Her stomach growled faintly, reminding her that she hadn’t eaten much the day before. But the thought of going downstairs, of facing everyone’s concerned eyes and worried questions, made her chest tighten.</p><p>“I’ll go later,” she muttered to herself, though the words felt hollow. She pulled her blanket tighter around her shoulders, trying to block out the muffled sound of laughter and conversation from below.</p><p>Her mind wandered back to her conversation with Alice. She had felt a momentary ease, a flicker of connection, but it hadn’t lasted. The weight of everything—the accident, her injuries, the pressure to recover—settled heavily on her once more.</p><p>Back in the living room, Agatha set her plate aside, barely having touched her food. Her eyes kept drifting toward the stairs, her worry mounting.</p><p>“Go talk to her,” Wanda said gently, catching her gaze.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her hands curling into fists. “She doesn’t want to talk. She doesn’t even want to be around anyone right now.”</p><p>“Maybe she doesn’t know how to ask for what she needs,” Jen suggested. “Sometimes, people just need to know you’re there.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, her jaw tightening with resolve. “I’ll try. But if she slams the door in my face, I’m blaming you all.”</p><p>Agatha climbed the stairs, her footsteps soft as she approached their room. She knocked lightly on the door. “Rio? It’s me.”</p><p>No response.</p><p>“Can I come in?” Agatha asked, her voice hesitant.</p><p>A faint “Yeah” came from the other side, barely audible. Agatha pushed the door open to find Rio still wrapped in her blanket, her eyes tired and distant.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said softly, closing the door behind her. “We missed you at breakfast.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, not meeting her gaze. “I wasn’t hungry.”</p><p>Agatha sat beside her on the bed, her hand resting lightly on Rio’s knee. “You didn’t sleep, did you?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, her voice quiet. “Every time I close my eyes, it’s there. The crash, the pain... It’s like I can’t escape it.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened, her heart aching for the woman she loved. “I’m so sorry, Rio. I wish I could take it all away.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, her eyes glistening. “I don’t know how to stop feeling like this, Aggie. I don’t even know who I am anymore.”</p><p>“You’re Rio,” Agatha said firmly, her voice filled with quiet conviction. “You’re strong and stubborn and brilliant. You’re the woman I love. And you’re going to get through this.”</p><p>Rio’s lip quivered, but she didn’t respond. Agatha reached out, pulling her into a gentle hug. “You’re not alone,” she whispered. “No matter how bad it gets, I’m here.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, leaning into the embrace. For the first time that morning, she let herself feel a small measure of comfort in Agatha’s arms.<br/><br/><em>Back in the kitchen</em></p><p>Billy shuffled into the kitchen, where Wanda was making tea. She glanced at him over her shoulder, raising an eyebrow. “You’re up early. What’s the occasion?”</p><p>Billy hesitated, rubbing the back of his neck. “I...kind of made plans.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression turned curious. “Oh? With who?”</p><p>“A kid named Tommy,” Billy explained. “The one I told you about...”</p><p>Wanda set down her mug, turning to face him fully. “And you want to meet him?”</p><p>Billy nodded. “I think he needs someone to talk to. Someone who gets it. I told him you’d come, too.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression softened, and she stepped closer, placing a hand on his shoulder. “You’re a good kid, Billy. Brave, too. I’ll come with you. We’ll figure this out together.”</p><p>Later that morning, Billy sat in the living room, fidgeting with the straps of his backpack. Wanda entered, keys in hand. “Ready?”</p><p>Billy nodded, standing. “Do you think he’ll show?”</p><p>“I think he will,” Wanda said reassuringly. “And if he doesn’t, that’s okay, too. But I have a feeling you’ll make an impression.”</p><p>Billy managed a small smile, though his stomach churned with nerves. “I hope so.”</p><p>As they headed out the door, he took a deep breath, bracing himself for whatever came next.</p><p>The café was small and cozy, its windows lined with potted plants and its tables scattered with people sipping coffee and working on laptops. Billy and Wanda chose a table near the corner, where they could see the door.</p><p>Billy fidgeted with his cup, his knee bouncing under the table. Wanda placed a hand on his arm, grounding him. “Relax,” she said softly. “This isn’t a test.”</p><p>Before Billy could respond, the bell above the door jingled. He looked up, his breath catching. A boy about his age stood in the doorway, his eyes scanning the room. His hair was messy, his clothes slightly too big, and his posture screamed nervousness.</p><p>“Is that him?” Wanda asked.</p><p>Billy nodded, his heart racing. “That’s him.”</p><p>“You okay, Teen?” Wanda asked gently, placing a hand on his arm.</p><p>“Yeah,” Billy replied, though his voice betrayed his nerves. “Just...nervous.”</p><p>“Tommy?” Billy asked, standing up.</p><p>“Yeah,” Tommy replied, his voice quiet. He looked at Wanda, his brow furrowing. “Your mum I assume?”</p><p>“Yeah, this is Wanda, she’s just here to make sure everything’s okay.”Billy explained quickly.</p><p>Wanda smiled warmly, extending a hand. “Nice to meet you, Tommy. Don’t mind me—I’m just here for support.”</p><p>Tommy hesitated before shaking her hand, then slid into the chair across from Billy. “So...what do you want to know?”</p><p>Billy and Wanda listened as Tommy began to talk, his words hesitant at first but gradually gaining momentum.</p><p>“I’ve been in the system since I was five,” he said, his fingers tracing patterns on the table. “My parents...they weren’t great. Drugs, fights, you know the drill. CPS finally took me away, but it didn’t get much better.”</p><p>Billy nodded, his chest tightening. “I get it. I’ve been there.”</p><p>Tommy glanced at him, a flicker of understanding passing between them. “My current foster family...they’re really religious. Like, hardcore. When they found out I was...you know, gay, they freaked out.”</p><p>Wanda’s jaw tightened, but she stayed silent, letting Tommy continue.</p><p>“They said it was just a phase, that I could be ‘fixed.’” He laughed bitterly. “So they sent me to conversion camp. Twice. Once when I was fifteen and again last year.”</p><p>Billy’s stomach churned. “What was it like?”</p><p>Tommy’s eyes darkened, his voice dropping. “Hell. They make you feel like you’re broken, like there’s something wrong with you. The counselors...they’d use shame, fear, whatever they could to get you to ‘change.’ But it doesn’t work. It just...messes you up more.”</p><p>Billy leaned forward, his voice soft. “I’m so sorry, Tommy. No one should have to go through that.”</p><p>Tommy shrugged, though his hands clenched into fists on the table. “It’s not like I had a choice. They said it was either the camp or they’d kick me out. And in the system, you don’t exactly get to pick where you go.”</p><p>Billy glanced at Wanda, who was visibly trying to keep her composure. He turned back to Tommy. “What about now? Are they still...?”</p><p>“They’re still my fosters,” Tommy said bitterly. “But they’ve been keeping their distance since the second camp. I guess they figured I’m a lost cause.”</p><p>“You’re not a lost cause,” Wanda said firmly, her voice filled with conviction. “You’re a brave young man who deserves better than what they’ve put you through.”</p><p>Tommy looked at her, his guarded expression softening slightly. “Thanks,” he said quietly.</p><p>Billy hesitated before speaking. “Tommy, I know this is a lot to ask, but...would you be willing to tell your story? To help us expose the people who run those camps and the ones funding them?”</p><p>Tommy’s eyes widened, and he leaned back in his chair. “I don’t know. It’s one thing to talk to you, but...going public? What if they find out?”</p><p>“We’ll protect you,” Wanda promised. “You won’t have to face them alone.”</p><p>Tommy chewed his lip, his gaze darting between Billy and Wanda. “I’ll think about it,” he said finally. “But I’m not making any promises.”</p><p>“That’s all we can ask,” Billy said, offering a small smile. “Just...know that we’re here for you. You’re not alone in this.”</p><p>Tommy nodded, a hint of gratitude in his eyes. “Thanks.”</p><p>As they left the café, Billy turned to Wanda, his expression thoughtful. “He’s just like me,” he said softly. “He’s been through so much, and he’s still standing.”</p><p>“He’s lucky to have you,” Wanda replied, wrapping an arm around Billy’s shoulders. “And you’re lucky to have him. Together, you can help each other heal.”</p><p>Billy smiled faintly, his resolve strengthening. “We’re going to stop them, Wanda. For Tommy, for me...for everyone.”</p><p>“We will,” Wanda said firmly. “No matter what it takes.”</p><p>As they walked away, the bond between them felt stronger than ever, their shared purpose driving them forward.<br/>~~~~~</p><p>As Billy and Wanda headed to the café, Jen and Alice prepared for their own meeting across town. Rebecca and Jeff, the two former employees of Evanora’s companies, had agreed to meet in person at a quiet diner. Jen adjusted her scarf as they stepped out of the car, glancing at Alice.</p><p>“You sure you’re ready for this?” Jen asked, her tone gentle but firm.</p><p>Alice nodded, though her grip on her bag was tight. “Yeah. If they’re legit, this could be huge.”</p><p>“And if they’re not?”</p><p>Alice sighed. “Then we’ll deal with it.”</p><p>Jen placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. “We’ve got this. Let’s go.”</p><p>The diner was small and unassuming, with red vinyl booths and the smell of fresh coffee hanging in the air. Rebecca and Jeff were already seated at a booth near the back, their faces tense as they scanned the room.</p><p>“There they are,” Alice murmured, her stomach twisting with nerves.</p><p>Jen led the way, her posture confident as she slid into the booth across from them. “Rebecca. Jeff. Thanks for meeting us.”</p><p>Rebecca nodded, her eyes sharp and focused. “Thanks for coming.”</p><p>Jeff fidgeted with his coffee cup, avoiding eye contact. “Yeah. Thanks.”</p><p>Alice settled in beside Jen, her gaze flicking between the two. “So, let’s get right to it. What made you decide to come forward?”</p><p>Rebecca leaned forward, her voice steady. “I worked for one of Evanora’s subsidiaries for five years. At first, everything seemed normal—good pay, decent benefits. But then I started noticing things.”</p><p>“Like what?” Alice prompted.</p><p>Rebecca hesitated before continuing. “Money being funneled to accounts that didn’t match up with the company’s projects. Sudden layoffs of employees who asked too many questions. And then there were the donations.”</p><p>Jen frowned. “Donations?”</p><p>Rebecca nodded. “Large sums of money being sent to organizations that didn’t make sense for a company like ours. I did some digging and found out they were funding conversion camps.”</p><p>Alice’s stomach turned, but she kept her expression neutral. “Do you have proof of this?”</p><p>Rebecca pulled out a folder from her bag and slid it across the table. “Bank statements, internal emails, and a list of organizations that received funds. I kept copies before I left.”</p><p>Jen opened the folder, her eyes scanning the documents. “This is solid,” she said quietly, glancing at Alice. “If this checks out, it’s a huge step forward.”</p><p>As Jen and Alice examined the documents, Jeff shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “I don’t have anything like that,” he muttered. “I just...I saw things. People getting fired, projects getting canceled for no reason. It didn’t add up.”</p><p>Alice looked at him, her tone gentle. “It’s okay, Jeff. Any information you can give us helps.”</p><p>Jeff nodded, but his hands trembled slightly. “I just...I don’t want her to come after me. You’ve seen what she’s capable of.”</p><p>“We’ll protect you,” Jen said firmly. “Both of you. But we need you to trust us.”</p><p>Rebecca placed a hand on Jeff’s arm, her voice soft. “They’re trying to help, Jeff. And we can’t keep living in fear.”</p><p>By the time the meeting ended, the tension in the air had eased slightly. Rebecca and Jeff agreed to testify, though Jeff was still hesitant.</p><p>As they left the diner, Alice turned to Jen, her expression a mix of relief and determination. “Rebecca’s stuff is legit. This could change everything.”</p><p>Jen nodded, her hand resting on Alice’s shoulder. “We’ll double-check it, but yeah. It’s a big step forward.”</p><p>“And Jeff?” Alice asked.</p><p>Jen sighed. “He’s scared. But if Rebecca’s on board, he might follow her lead.”</p><p>Alice smiled faintly. “One step at a time.”<br/><br/></p><p>
<em>Meanwhile back home</em>
</p><p>The kitchen was bathed in soft morning light when Rio emerged from her room, her stomach growling and her steps hesitant. She had assumed everyone else would be out by now—Wanda with Billy, Jen with Alice, Agatha...probably engrossed in work somewhere else.</p><p>Rubbing her neck, she stepped into the kitchen, only to stop short. Agatha was standing at the sink, her sleeves rolled up and her hands busy with soapy dishes. On the counter beside her, a wicker basket sat partially open, filled with neatly wrapped sandwiches, fruits, and a thermos.</p><p>Rio blinked. “Are we going on a picnic I don’t know about?”</p><p>Agatha glanced over her shoulder, her eyes softening at the sight of Rio. “Morning,” she said, her tone light. “And no, not ‘we.’ Just me. I thought you’d still be hiding in your room.”</p><p>Rio winced but tried to play it off with a smirk. “Hiding? I don’t hide.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow, turning back to the sink. “Sure, you don’t.”</p><p>Rio moved to the counter, grabbing a piece of bread and slathering it with peanut butter. She watched Agatha out of the corner of her eye, unsure of what to say. The tension from their argument still lingered between them, unspoken but palpable.</p><p>“What’s the basket for, then?” Rio asked after a few moments of silence.</p><p>Agatha rinsed a plate, setting it on the drying rack. “I thought I’d take a break from all this...chaos. Go somewhere quiet for a while.”</p><p>Rio frowned, her appetite fading. “Alone?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Sometimes it’s easier to think when I’m not surrounded by everyone’s noise. Including yours.”</p><p>Rio flinched at the jab, though Agatha’s tone wasn’t harsh. “Right. Makes sense.”</p><p>Agatha finished the dishes, drying her hands on a towel before turning to face Rio. Her expression softened as she took in the other woman’s tired eyes and tense posture. “You didn’t eat dinner last night.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Didn’t feel like it.”</p><p>“And breakfast?”</p><p>Rio avoided her gaze. “Wasn’t hungry.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, stepping closer. “Rio, you can’t keep doing this. You’re going to make yourself sick.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio said quickly, though her voice lacked conviction. “You don’t have to worry about me.”</p><p>“But I do,” Agatha said, her voice firm. “Whether you want me to or not, I do.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, the weight of Agatha’s words sinking in. “I don’t know how to stop feeling like...like I’m just dragging everyone down.”</p><p>“You’re not dragging anyone down,” Agatha said, stepping even closer. “You’re going through something hard, and we’re all here to help you. Even if you don’t want us to be.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her fingers tightening around the edge of the counter. “So, where are you going on this picnic?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, studying her. “Why? Thinking of inviting yourself?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio said with a faint smile. “If you’ll let me.”</p><p>Agatha considered her for a moment before nodding. “Fine. But only if you eat something first.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Bribery?”</p><p>“Motivation,” Agatha corrected, grabbing an apple from the counter and holding it out. “Take it or leave it.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but took the apple, taking a big bite. “Happy?”</p><p>“Getting there,” Agatha said, a small smile tugging at her lips as she leaned to give her a gentle peck on the lips. “Now, go get dressed. We’re leaving in twenty minutes.”</p><p>As Rio disappeared down the hall to change, Agatha turned back to the basket, adding a few extra snacks. The heaviness in her chest had lifted slightly, replaced by a flicker of hope.</p><p>When Rio returned, dressed in jeans and a hoodie, she looked more relaxed, though the shadows under her eyes remained. Agatha handed her the basket, grabbing her keys from the counter.</p><p>“Ready?” she asked.</p><p>Rio nodded, her smile hesitant but genuine. “Yeah. Let’s go.”</p><p>As they headed out the door, the tension between them began to ease, replaced by the quiet understanding that they were both trying. And for now, that was enough.</p><p>The car ride to the park was quiet but not uncomfortable. Agatha focused on the road while Rio gazed out the window, the basket sitting securely on her lap. The city gradually gave way to open fields and trees, the crisp autumn air seeping through the slightly cracked windows.</p><p>“So,” Rio said after a while, breaking the silence. “Is this your secret getaway spot, or do you just Google ‘quiet parks near me’ and hope for the best?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, her fingers tapping the steering wheel. “It’s a place I used to go when I needed to think. I came here a lot during law school. It’s quiet, peaceful. Feels like a different world.”</p><p>Rio glanced at her, noticing the faraway look in her eyes. “You really needed to think that much, huh?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly. “You’d be surprised how loud my brain gets sometimes. It helps to have somewhere to clear it.”</p><p>The park was nearly empty, a scattering of golden leaves carpeting the grass. Agatha parked near a quiet grove of trees, and they carried the basket to a shaded spot under a large oak.</p><p>Rio spread out the blanket while Agatha unpacked the basket, setting out sandwiches, fruit, and a thermos of tea. She glanced up at Rio, who was unusually quiet.</p><p>“Penny for your thoughts?” Agatha asked, handing her a sandwich.</p><p>Rio took it, hesitating before answering. “Just...thinking about everything. How we got here. How messy everything feels.”</p><p>Agatha sat beside her, pouring tea into two small cups. “Life’s messy,” she said simply. “But we’re figuring it out.”</p><p>Rio nodded, though her expression remained clouded. “Sometimes I wonder if we’ll ever actually be okay. You know? Like, if we’re always going to be fighting something.”</p><p>Agatha reached over, resting a hand on Rio’s. “We’ll figure it out. Together.”</p><p>They ate in companionable silence for a while, the sounds of rustling leaves and distant birds filling the air. After finishing her sandwich, Rio leaned back against the tree, her gaze fixed on the canopy above.</p><p>“You know,” she said softly, “I’ve been thinking a lot about what you said. About how I push people away.”</p><p>Agatha paused, setting down her tea. “I wasn’t trying to hurt you when I said that.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said quickly. “And you were right. I do it because...I’m scared. Scared of being too much, of dragging people down. Of losing them.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened at the vulnerability in Rio’s voice. “You’re not too much,” she said firmly. “And you’re not dragging me down. If anything, you make me stronger.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, her eyes searching. “Even with all my baggage? Even with everything that’s happened?”</p><p>“Especially with everything that’s happened,” Agatha replied, her voice steady. “You’re not a burden, Rio. You’re my partner. And I love you.”</p><p>Rio’s lips quirked into a small smile. “You’re really good at this ‘supportive girlfriend’ thing, you know that?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, leaning back on her hands. “I try. But you make it easy.”</p><p>They sat in silence for a while, the tension between them dissolving. Then Rio glanced at the basket, her grin turning mischievous. “Did you seriously pack carrot sticks? Who does that on a picnic?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, tossing a baby carrot at her. “Some of us like to eat healthy.”</p><p>Rio caught the carrot and pretended to examine it critically. “You’re such a nerd.”</p><p>“And you’re impossible,” Agatha shot back, laughing.</p><p>As the sun began to dip lower in the sky, casting golden light over the park, Rio leaned her head against Agatha’s shoulder. They sat in comfortable silence, watching the leaves sway in the breeze.</p><p>“I needed this,” Rio admitted quietly. “More than I realized.”</p><p>“Me too,” Agatha said, resting her head against Rio’s. <br/><br/>Agatha, her blue eyes sparkling with affection, smiled tenderly at her partner. "I'm glad we're here, just the two of us. It's been too long since we had some quality time together." She ran her fingers through Rio's hair, a gesture of affection and comfort. "Life has a way of getting in the way, but we'll make sure to create more moments like this."</p><p>Rio nodded, her face softening as she considered the challenges they had faced. "It hasn't been easy, but having you by my side makes everything bearable. I know I can lean on you, no matter what." Her words were filled with sincerity, reflecting the deep bond they shared.</p><p>As the wind played with their hair, they sat in silence, each lost in their thoughts. Rio's mind wandered to the accident, the memory of the crash still vivid. She had been lucky to escape with her life, and the recovery process had been arduous. But throughout it all, Agatha had been her rock, tending to her every need with unwavering devotion.</p><p>"I'm so grateful for you, Agatha," Rio said, her voice thick with emotion. "You've been my strength when I felt weak. I don't know what I would've done without you."</p><p>Agatha's heart melted at Rio's words. She knew the struggles Rio had endured, and it pained her to see her lover in pain. "You're my everything, Rio. I'd do anything to see you happy and healthy again. We'll get through this together, just like we always do."</p><p>Rio's eyes glistened with unshed tears, and she leaned in, capturing Agatha's lips in a tender kiss. Their lips moved in perfect harmony, conveying the depth of their love and commitment. As they parted, Rio's hand found its way to Agatha's thigh, her touch sending a shiver of desire through Agatha's body.</p><p>"I want you, right here, right now," Rio whispered, her breath hot against Agatha's ear. "I need to feel you, to be inside you." Her words were laced with passion, a raw desire that ignited a fire within Agatha.</p><p>Agatha's pulse quickened, and she could feel her body responding to Rio's touch. "Here? In the park?" she asked, her voice laced with both excitement and surprise.</p><p>Rio nodded, her eyes darkening with lust. "Why not? It's secluded enough, and I can't wait any longer. I need to feel your body against mine."</p><p>Agatha's heart raced as she realized Rio's intentions. She was about to protest but as she looked at Rio's eyes, she realized Rio needed this as much as she did.<br/><br/>The thought of making love to her right there, in the open air, was exhilarating. She had always been adventurous, and Rio's boldness only fueled her desire.</p><p>"Okay," she whispered, her voice hoarse with anticipation. "But we should move to a more private spot."</p><p>They stood up, their movements graceful and filled with anticipation. Holding hands, they ventured deeper into the park, away from the well-trodden paths. The further they ventured, the denser the foliage became, providing a natural barrier that shielded them from prying eyes.</p><p>Rio led Agatha to a large oak tree, its gnarled roots forming a natural alcove. She pressed Agatha against the rough bark, her lips finding Agatha's neck, leaving a trail of kisses as she made her way up to her ear. "I've been craving this," she murmured, her breath hot against Agatha's skin.</p><p>Agatha moaned softly, her body already on fire. She reached for Rio's shirt, eager to feel her skin. With a swift motion, she pulled the fabric over Rio's head, revealing her toned torso and full breasts. Rio's nipples were already erect, begging for attention.</p><p>Agatha's hands cupped Rio's breasts, her thumbs teasing the hardened peaks. Rio arched into the touch, her head falling back as a soft moan escaped her lips. "Yes, Agatha," she breathed, her voice laced with pleasure.</p><p>Agatha's mouth found Rio's, their tongues dancing in a passionate kiss. Rio's hands roamed over Agatha's body, unbuttoning her blouse and sliding it off her shoulders, exposing her skin. Agatha's breasts, full and heavy, spilled into Rio's waiting hands, who massaged and squeezed them, eliciting a series of gasps from Agatha.</p><p>Rio's fingers deftly unhooked Agatha's bra, freeing her breasts. She took one nipple into her mouth, sucking and teasing it with her tongue, while her hand worked its magic on the other. Agatha's hands tangled in Rio's hair, guiding her, urging her on as pleasure coursed through her body.</p><p>"Oh, Rio," Agatha panted, her hips thrusting forward involuntarily. "You're driving me wild."</p><p>Rio smiled against her skin, her breath hot and ragged. "That's the idea," she whispered, before trailing kisses down Agatha's body. Her lips brushed against Agatha's sensitive skin, leaving a trail of goosebumps in their wake.</p><p>Agatha's legs trembled as Rio's mouth found her navel, her tongue swirling and teasing. She tugged at the waistband of Agatha's skirt, sliding it down her hips, revealing her lace panties. Rio's fingers hooked into the sides, slowly pulling them down, exposing Agatha's glistening wetness.</p><p>"You're so wet," Rio murmured, her voice husky with desire. She inhaled the scent of Agatha's arousal, her breath hot against her sensitive flesh. "I love how much you want me."</p><p>Agatha's breath hitched as Rio's fingers parted her folds, stroking her slickness. "Please, Rio," she begged, her voice thick with need. "I need you inside me."</p><p>Rio positioned herself between Agatha's legs, her fingers now in front of Agatha's entrance, teasing her before slowly pushing them inside. Agatha's body welcomed Rio's invasion, her walls clenching around her lover's fingers.</p><p>Rio groaned, the sensation of Agatha's warmth enveloping her fingers almost too much to bear. She began to move, her fingers thrusting in a slow, steady rhythm. Agatha met each thrust, her hands gripping Rio's shoulders, her nails digging into her skin as pleasure spiraled through her.</p><p>"Harder, Rio," she pleaded, her voice hoarse. "Fuck me harder."</p><p>Rio obliged, her movements becoming more urgent, her fingers plunging knuckle deep within Agatha's wetness. Agatha's moans filled the air, a melody of pleasure and desire. She wrapped her legs around Rio, pulling her closer, urging her on.</p><p>As Rio's pace quickened, Agatha's body tightened around her, her orgasm building with each thrust.</p><p>Agatha's fingers dug into Rio's back, her nails scraping against her skin as she rode the waves of pleasure. "I'm close RIo," she cried out.</p><p>Their bodies moved in perfect unison. With a final, powerful surge, Agatha cried out, her orgasms crashing over her like a tidal wave.</p><p>They collapsed against each other, their hearts pounding in time with the fading echoes of their passion. Rio's lips found Agatha's, their kiss tender and filled with love.</p><p>"I love you, Agatha," Rio whispered, her voice hoarse with emotion. "You're my strength, my everything."</p><p>Agatha smiled, her eyes shining with adoration. "I love you too, Rio. Always and forever.</p><p>As they lay entwined, their bodies still buzzing with pleasure, they knew that their love would carry them through any storm. This moment, stolen from the chaos of life, had reaffirmed their bond, reminding them of the power of their connection.<br/><br/>"Now let me return the favor" Agatha chuckled and slowly made her way between Rio's legs, trailing a path of kisses all over her skin.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Wanda and Billy stepped through the front door, the weight of the day lifting off their shoulders. Wanda’s excitement was palpable, her steps light as she hummed a little tune.</p><p>“Can you believe it?” she asked, turning to Billy with a grin. “Tommy is really going to get some of his friends to testify. This could actually work.”</p><p>Billy smiled, feeling the same hope rising within him. “I’m proud of him. This could be the beginning of turning everything around.”</p><p>As they entered the hallway, Wanda’s smile faltered. Something was wrong.</p><p>The door had been left ajar, a small detail that immediately set off alarm bells in Wanda’s mind.</p><p>“Did we forget to lock up?” Billy asked, his voice tinged with confusion.</p><p>Wanda’s heart skipped a beat. “No, I locked it before we left. Something’s not right.”</p><p>Wanda’s hand shook as she pushed the door fully open, stepping cautiously into the living room. Her eyes immediately scanned the area, her heart sinking. The room had been upended. Furniture was overturned, drawers pulled out, papers scattered across the floor. It looked as if someone had torn through the place in a frantic search.</p><p>“Billy...” Wanda’s voice trembled. “Stay here. I’m going to check the rest of the house.”</p><p>Billy followed her steps into the kitchen, his eyes widening as he saw the state of the countertops. Pots and pans were scattered on the floor, the refrigerator door hanging open. A clear trail of chaos led down the hallway.</p><p>Wanda moved quickly, her senses on high alert. She hurried to the back rooms, Billy close behind her, his face pale.</p><p>“Who would do this?” Billy muttered, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Wanda said, panic creeping into her voice. “But they were looking for something.”</p><p>They reached the study, the last room to check. The door was ajar, and Wanda’s blood ran cold when she stepped inside. The desk had been completely ransacked—papers were torn, files scattered, and the laptops were gone.</p><p>“No...” Wanda whispered, a hand covering her mouth in disbelief. “They took everything...the files...the laptops...”</p><p>Billy stepped into the room, his hands trembling. “What were they looking for, Mom? What did they want?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Wanda said, her voice shaking as she crouched beside the desk, staring at the destruction around her. “But they knew exactly what to take. They knew what was important.”</p><p>Wanda stood up, pacing the room. “The papers. The laptops. All of it—gone. They’ve taken everything related to the case.”</p><p>Billy’s face fell as the realization set in. “Do you think it was Evanora? Or someone working for her?”</p><p>Wanda nodded grimly. “It’s the only explanation. She must’ve found out what we’re planning. She’s trying to stop us.”</p><p>Billy clenched his fists, frustration burning in his chest. “How could she be so...so ruthless? We were just trying to do the right thing.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes softened as she looked at Billy. “I know, Billy. I know. But we can’t stop now. We can’t let her win.”</p><p>Wanda moved to the phone, her hands shaking as she dialed Agatha’s number. The phone rang, but when Agatha picked up, her voice was calm but laced with concern.</p><p>“Wanda? What’s wrong?”</p><p>“We’ve been broken into,” Wanda said, her voice tight. “They took everything—the evidence, the laptops... It’s all gone.”</p><p>Agatha’s response was immediate, her tone steely. “I’ll be right there.”</p><p>Wanda hung up, turning to Billy, who had slumped onto the couch, his head in his hands. “It’s not over,” she said, her voice resolute. “We’re not backing down now.”</p><p>“I know,” Billy replied quietly, looking up at her with determination. “But they’ve made it personal now, haven’t they?”</p><p>Wanda nodded grimly, her heart heavy. “Yes, they have. And now, we’re going to make them regret it.”</p><p>A few minutes later, Agatha arrived, her face taut with worry. She took one look at the disarray and let out a soft curse. “Whoever did this is playing dirty,” she said, walking further into the living room, surveying the destruction. “Are you two okay?”</p><p>Wanda nodded, though her voice wavered. “We’re fine. But everything we had on Evanora—gone.”</p><p>Agatha clenched her fists. “We’ll get it back. We’ll figure out what happened.”</p><p>“Do you think she’s watching us?” Billy asked, his voice small but filled with fear.</p><p>“It’s possible,” Agatha said, her eyes hardening. “But she’s not the only one with resources. We’ll find a way to get our hands on whatever she’s trying to hide.”</p><p>As the group stood in the wrecked living room, the weight of the situation hung heavily between them. The case they had worked so hard to build had been set back, the evidence now in the hands of whoever had targeted them. But instead of feeling defeated, there was a quiet resolve that settled in the room.</p><p>“We can’t stop now,” Wanda said, her voice gaining strength. “She thinks this will make us back off, but she’s wrong.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her eyes meeting Wanda’s. “We’re just getting started.”</p><p>Billy stood up, his posture straightening. “We won’t let her win. Not this time.”</p><p>Wanda smiled, the weight of the loss still heavy on her heart but replaced by a fierce determination. “No, we won’t.”</p><p>Wanda paced the living room, her phone pressed to her ear as she spoke with the police. Her voice was calm but clipped, betraying the storm of emotions churning beneath the surface.</p><p>“Yes, the house was broken into,” she said, glancing at the overturned furniture and scattered papers. “The main things missing are our laptops and some important documents. No, nothing else of significant value was taken.”</p><p>Billy sat nearby, his arms wrapped around his knees as he watched her. The disarray around him felt like a physical manifestation of the chaos in his mind. Agatha stood beside him, her hand resting reassuringly on his shoulder.</p><p>When Wanda hung up, she let out a frustrated sigh. “They’ll send someone over to take a statement and look for fingerprints, but we all know this was calculated. Whoever did this knew exactly what to take.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her expression grim. “It’s a message. She’s telling us she knows what we’re doing and that she’s one step ahead.”</p><p>The sound of a car pulling into the driveway broke the tense silence. Moments later, Rio (who had been talking on the phone outside), Alice, and Jen entered the house, their expressions shifting from confusion to shock as they took in the scene.</p><p>“What the hell happened?” Rio asked, her voice sharp as she stepped over an overturned chair.</p><p>“Evanora happened,” Agatha said, her voice tight. “She had someone break in and take everything—our laptops, our notes, all of it.”</p><p>Alice’s face paled, and she instinctively clutched her bag tighter. “All of it?”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her jaw clenched. “Everything.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, and she quickly pulled out her phone, her fingers flying across the screen. “Wait...maybe not.”</p><p>Agatha turned to Rio, her brow furrowing. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Rio barely glanced up as she scrolled through her phone. “When I was in the hospital, I had this feeling—call it paranoia or whatever—that Evanora would pull something like this. So I backed everything up. All the files, all the notes, even the evidence Alice and I collected.”</p><p>“You backed it up?” Jen asked, her voice tinged with hope. “Where?”</p><p>“On a secure cloud server,” Rio said, a small smile tugging at her lips as she found the files. “It’s all here.”</p><p>The room seemed to collectively exhale. Wanda placed a hand over her chest, relief washing over her features. “Rio, you’re a genius.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, a hint of pride in her expression. “More like overly cautious. But I’ll take the compliment.”</p><p>As Rio connected her phone to the TV, the group gathered around to review the files she had saved. The familiar folders and documents appeared on the screen, each one intact and accounted for.</p><p>“This is everything,” Alice said, her voice tinged with disbelief. “Every file we had before...it’s all here.”</p><p>“And it’s secure?” Agatha asked, her gaze fixed on Rio.</p><p>“Completely,” Rio assured her. “No one’s getting into this without my password and a two-step verification.”</p><p>Wanda let out a soft laugh, her shoulders relaxing for the first time that evening. “Rio, you just saved this entire operation.”</p><p>Rio smirked, leaning back against the couch. “Yeah, well, don’t get used to me being the responsible one.”</p><p>As the group reviewed the files and began discussing their next steps, the tension in the room began to lift. They still had a long road ahead, but the knowledge that their work wasn’t lost gave them a renewed sense of purpose.</p><p>Agatha leaned over, brushing her hand against Rio’s. “Thank you,” she said softly. “For thinking ahead. For always having my back. Our backs.”</p><p>Rio met her gaze, a flicker of warmth in her eyes. “Always.”</p><p>Wanda stood, clapping her hands together. “Alright, let’s regroup. We’ve got work to do, and now we know we’re still in the game.”</p><p>The group nodded, their determination solidifying. Evanora may have struck a blow, but they weren’t out of the fight. If anything, they were more ready than ever to take her down.<br/><br/>~~~~</p><p>Agatha stepped out onto the porch, the cool evening air biting at her skin as she dialed Lilia’s number. Her hand trembled slightly as she held the phone to her ear, exhaustion and frustration weighing her down. The chaos inside the house felt suffocating, and the gravity of what had happened was finally sinking in.</p><p>Lilia picked up on the second ring. “Agatha? What’s going on?”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath. “We’ve been hit, Lilia. The house was broken into while Wanda and Billy were out. They took everything—laptops, papers, notes. Anything related to the case is gone.”</p><p>Lilia cursed under her breath. “Damn it, Agatha. Did you call the police?”</p><p>“They’re here now, taking statements and looking for fingerprints,” Agatha replied. “But we both know they’re not going to find anything. This was professional.”</p><p>Lilia’s tone was sharp. “And Evanora?”</p><p>“It has to be her,” Agatha said firmly. “Who else would go to these lengths?”</p><p>There was a pause on the other end. “Do you still have any of the evidence?”</p><p>“Rio backed everything up while she was in the hospital,” Agatha said, a hint of relief in her voice. “We’re not out of the game, but she doesn’t know that.”</p><p>Lilia exhaled slowly. “Good. This could be an opportunity, Agatha. If she thinks you’ve lost everything, she might get careless. But be careful—she’s desperate now, more desperate than ever before, and desperate people are dangerous.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, though her jaw tightened. “We’re going to turn this around, Lilia. She hasn’t won yet.”</p><p>“Keep me updated,” Lilia said. “And Agatha...watch your back.”</p><p>“I always do,” Agatha murmured before ending the call. She leaned against the railing, staring out at the dark street. Her resolve was unshakable. Evanora had underestimated them, and she was going to regret it.</p><p>Inside, the atmosphere was tense. Rio sat on the couch, her leg bouncing as she watched the police move through the house. Her mind was racing, piecing together fragments of a plan. The chaotic state of the living room mirrored the turmoil in her head.</p><p>Wanda approached, sitting beside her. “You okay?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her eyes darting toward the others. “Not really. But I think...I think I know what we can do.”</p><p>Wanda tilted her head. “What are you thinking?”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath. “Evanora thinks she’s won, right? That we’ve lost everything? So we use that against her. We contact her legal team and pretend we’re desperate—say we’re looking for a deal or a plea bargain because we have nothing left to fight with.”</p><p>Wanda’s brow furrowed. “Wouldn’t that make us look weak?”</p><p>“Exactly,” Rio said, her voice gaining strength. “If she thinks we’re cornered, she might get cocky. Maybe she’ll even let something slip.”</p><p>The room fell silent as Rio’s words hung in the air. Agatha, who had just reentered the house, crossed her arms and studied her. “That’s risky.”</p><p>“It’s the only move we’ve got right now,” Rio countered, standing up. “Evanora’s playing dirty, and we need to make her think she’s already won. That’s when she’ll make a mistake.”</p><p>Alice leaned against the wall, her arms crossed. “It’s a good idea. But how do we do that without any of our equipment?”</p><p>Rio’s confident expression faltered for a moment before she shrugged. “We figure it out. Wanda said she’d look into getting us new laptops, right?”</p><p>Wanda nodded. “I’ll make some calls.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, running a hand through her hair. “Alright. Let’s plan this out. But no more risks. If we’re going to do this, we’re doing it right.”</p><p>The group gathered around the dining table, Rio taking the lead as they began piecing together the details of their strategy. She scribbled notes on a pad of paper, her energy infectious as she outlined the plan.</p><p>“We need to sound convincing,” Rio said. “Desperate, but not too desperate. Like we’re clinging to the last shred of hope.”</p><p>“Think of it as a performance,” Agatha added, leaning over the table. “Evanora loves control. She’ll want to see us grovel.”</p><p>Jen, sitting beside Alice, frowned. “But what if she doesn’t take the bait? Or worse, what if she sees through it?”</p><p>“That’s why we have to make it airtight,” Rio said firmly. “No holes, no hesitation.”</p><p>Agatha watched Rio, a small smile tugging at her lips despite the stress of the situation. For the first time in days, Rio seemed like herself again—driven, resourceful, and fiercely determined.</p><p>As the planning session wound down, Agatha pulled Rio aside, her hand resting lightly on her arm. “Hey.”</p><p>Rio turned to her, raising an eyebrow. “What’s up?”</p><p>Agatha’s expression softened. “I’m proud of you. For stepping up like this. For coming up with a plan.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, her cheeks flushing. “I needed to do something, Aggie. I’ve been feeling...useless.”</p><p>“You’re not useless,” Agatha said firmly. “You’re incredible. And you’re the reason we’re still in this fight.”</p><p>Rio’s smile grew, and she leaned into Agatha’s touch. “Thanks. For believing in me.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her chest tightening with emotion. “Always.” she whispered and leaned to kiss Rio, feeling as if a breath they had both been holding was just released.<br/><br/></p><p>By the time the police left, the group was exhausted but more determined than ever. Wanda promised to follow up on getting new equipment, while Alice and Jen reviewed the paper notes they still had.</p><p>Rio sat back on the couch, her fingers tapping against her knee. For the first time in weeks, she felt like she had a purpose again. The fear and frustration that had weighed her down were still there, but they were tempered by the spark of hope.</p><p>As the house quieted for the night, Agatha joined Rio on the couch, her hand slipping into hers, fingers intertwined. They didn’t speak, but the connection between them said everything. They were in this together, and no amount of chaos or destruction would change that.</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>The kitchen bustled with activity, the tension of the day momentarily forgotten as the group settled into their respective tasks. Wanda, Jen, and Agatha stood on one side of the counter, chopping vegetables and debating seasoning choices, while Alice, Billy, and Rio commandeered the other side, surrounded by bowls of ingredients for dessert.</p><p>“Alright, people,” Wanda declared, her hands on her hips. “Let’s keep it organized. No food fights, no sabotaging the dessert team.”</p><p>Billy grinned mischievously, holding up a bag of flour. “No promises.”</p><p>“Billy,” Rio said in a warning tone, though her smirk betrayed her amusement. “Focus. We’re making brownies, not a mess.”</p><p>Alice chuckled, stirring a bowl of batter. “Speak for yourself. A little chaos never hurt anyone.”<br/><br/>"Hey! That's my line!" Rio gasped feigning offense.</p><p>Agatha glanced over, raising an eyebrow. “I’m holding you all personally responsible if this kitchen looks like a war zone by the end of the night.”</p><p>Despite Wanda’s warning, chaos unfolded anyway. Billy managed to spill a bag of sugar, and Rio accidentally splattered chocolate on Alice’s sleeve. Their laughter echoed through the kitchen, the sound contagious enough to make Wanda and Agatha crack smiles despite themselves.</p><p>Jen, whisking a vinaigrette for the salad, shook her head. “You’d think we were hosting a cooking show for toddlers.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio protested, licking a bit of batter off her finger. “Some of the best desserts come from chaos.”</p><p>“Or diabetes,” Agatha muttered, eyeing the amount of sugar being poured into the batter.</p><p>Wanda nudged her. “Let them have their fun. It’s been a rough few days.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, her features softening. “Fair point. But if Billy tries to sneak another chocolate chip, he’s banned from the kitchen.”</p><p>Billy froze mid-reach, his mouth full of chocolate chips. “What? These are quality control checks!”</p><p>The room erupted in laughter, the atmosphere light and carefree for the first time in days.</p><p>By the time dinner was ready, the kitchen looked surprisingly clean, thanks to Alice’s insistence on tidying as they went. The group gathered around the living room, plates balanced on laps and glasses of wine or juice in hand.</p><p>The meal was simple but delicious—a comforting blend of roasted vegetables, seasoned chicken, and fresh salad. The brownies, slightly overbaked but still gooey in the center, were a hit.</p><p>“This is amazing,” Alice said through a mouthful of brownie. “I’m pretty sure we’re culinary geniuses.”</p><p>“Pretty sure that’s the sugar talking,” Jen teased, sipping her wine. “But I’ll take the compliment.”</p><p>As the plates were cleared away, the group settled into the couches, a warm, relaxed energy filling the room. Wanda leaned back, cradling her glass of wine. “Alright, let’s lighten the mood. Funny stories. Who’s got one?”</p><p>Billy perked up. “Oh! Remember when Rio and I tried to make pancakes in foster care, but we didn’t know the difference between baking soda and baking powder?”</p><p>Rio groaned, covering her face. “No, Billy, we don’t need to relive that.”</p><p>“Yes, we do,” Billy insisted, grinning. “She didn’t just use baking soda. She used <em>two tablespoons</em> of it. The pancakes puffed up like balloons and tasted like soap.”</p><p>The room burst into laughter, Agatha nearly spilling her drink as she leaned forward. “You’re kidding.”</p><p>“I wish I were,” Rio said, though she was smiling now. “They were so bad even the rats in the foster home wouldn’t touch them.”</p><p>The stories continued, each one more ridiculous than the last. Alice shared a tale about accidentally publishing a typo in her school newspaper that turned “meet the teacher night” into “meat the teacher night.” Jen confessed to once getting locked in her dorm bathroom during a fire drill.</p><p>When the laughter died down, Wanda looked around the room, her smile soft. “We needed this,” she said quietly. “It’s been...a lot lately. But nights like this remind me why we’re doing all this.”</p><p>Agatha reached over, squeezing Wanda’s hand. “Agreed. We’ve got each other. That’s what matters.”</p><p>Rio glanced at the group, a warmth spreading through her chest. Despite everything, they had found a way to laugh, to connect, to keep moving forward. For the first time in days, she felt like they could win this fight—not just for themselves, but for everyone they were trying to protect.</p><p>The laughter from the group’s storytelling lingered in the air, the mood lighter than it had been in days. Wanda glanced around, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “Okay, so we’ve had dinner, dessert, and funny stories. What now?”</p><p>Billy perked up, sitting cross-legged on the couch. “How about a game?”</p><p>“What kind of game?” Rio asked, her eyebrow arching with intrigue.</p><p>Wanda grinned. “Charades.”</p><p>Alice groaned. “You just want an excuse to show off your acting skills.”</p><p>“Guilty,” Wanda admitted with a wink. “Come on, it’ll be fun.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated. “Do we really want to risk a game that’s practically designed to start arguments?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Only if you’re a sore loser, Aggie.”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha huffed, crossing her arms. “But if anyone cheats, I’m flipping the table.”</p><p>The group split into two teams: Wanda, Billy, and Alice on one side, and Agatha, Rio, and Jen on the other. Wanda grabbed a notepad and began writing down ideas for the clues while Billy rummaged through a drawer for a timer.</p><p>“Alright,” Wanda said, holding up the notepad. “Rules are simple: no talking, no mouthing words, and definitely no pointing at objects in the room to cheat.”</p><p>“Looking at you, Rio,” Billy teased, earning a playful nudge from her.</p><p>Agatha smirked, leaning back in her chair. “Let’s just get on with it. I’d like to win this century.”</p><p>Wanda’s team went first, with Alice taking the stage. She picked up a clue and began wildly flapping her arms, hopping in place.</p><p>“Bird!” Billy shouted.</p><p>“No, a duck!” Wanda added.</p><p>Alice shook her head, pointing furiously at her beak and miming swimming.</p><p>“Penguin!” Wanda guessed triumphantly just as the timer buzzed.</p><p>“Close call,” Alice said, grinning as she sat down. “But we nailed it.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Barely. Watch and learn.”</p><p>Agatha stood in the center of the room, her arms crossed as she picked a clue. She opened the paper and immediately groaned. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”</p><p>“No whining,” Wanda called out. “Get to it, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha glared at her before taking a deep breath. She began dramatically pretending to climb a ladder, then mimed eating something.</p><p>“Jack and the Beanstalk?” Jen guessed.</p><p>“No, it’s...uh...Rapunzel?” Rio added, squinting.</p><p>Agatha groaned louder, pointing at the imaginary ladder and then mimicking something round.</p><p>“Is it a pie ladder?” Jen ventured, earning laughter from everyone.</p><p>“It’s a <em>pizza delivery guy,</em> you idiots!” Agatha snapped as the timer buzzed.</p><p>The room erupted in laughter, with Wanda nearly falling off the couch. “That was terrible!”</p><p>“It’s your terrible clues,” Agatha shot back, though her lips twitched with amusement.</p><p>When it was Rio’s turn, she strutted to the center, confidence oozing from her. She grabbed a clue and read it, her grin widening.</p><p>She began dramatically pretending to write something, pausing to strike an exaggerated thinking pose. Then she mimicked holding a camera and pointing it at the imaginary paper.</p><p>“Journalist!” Agatha guessed.</p><p>“Rio?” Jen added, laughing.</p><p>Rio pointed at Agatha, then pretended to type furiously, ending with an exaggerated mic drop.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness after finishing a big case?” Jen quipped, earning snickers from everyone.</p><p>“It’s <em>breaking news,</em> you fools!” Rio yelled as the timer buzzed.</p><p>The game continued, each team gaining points and laughing through increasingly ridiculous performances. Wanda pretended to be a chicken crossing the road, while Billy’s attempt at mimicking a robot had everyone crying with laughter.</p><p>By the end of the game, the scores were tied, and it came down to Agatha and Wanda in the final round. Wanda grabbed her clue and began miming something elaborate, her movements graceful and precise.</p><p>“She’s...a dancer!” Billy guessed.</p><p>“No, a ballerina!” Alice added.</p><p>Wanda froze, her hands framing her face dramatically.</p><p>“A mime!” Rio shouted just as the timer went off.</p><p>“Correct!” Wanda declared, throwing her hands in the air. “Victory is ours!”</p><p>As the game ended, the group collapsed onto the couches, exhausted but grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>“That was surprisingly fun,” Agatha admitted, leaning against Rio.</p><p>“Surprising because you lost?” Wanda teased, earning a mock glare.</p><p>“Next time, we’re playing something with strategy,” Agatha retorted. “I need to reclaim my dignity.”</p><p>“You mean Monopoly?” Billy asked innocently, making everyone groan.</p><p>As the night wound down, the group basked in the warmth of their shared laughter, the weight of their fight against Evanora momentarily forgotten. For now, they were just friends, enjoying each other’s company and finding solace in the joy of a simple game.<br/><br/>~~~~~~</p><p>The next morning, sunlight streamed through the windows of Wanda’s house, bathing the kitchen in a warm glow. Wanda stood at the stove, flipping pancakes while the scent of fresh coffee filled the air. Slowly, the group began to gather, drawn by the promise of breakfast.</p><p>“Good morning,” Wanda greeted, sliding a stack of pancakes onto a plate. “Hope you’re all hungry.”</p><p>Billy was the first to sit, his eyes lighting up at the sight of the food. “You spoil us, Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda ruffled his hair. “Someone’s got to keep you fed.”</p><p>As the others joined the table, Wanda cleared her throat to get their attention. “So, I’ve been thinking. We lost a lot of equipment during the break-in, and it’s time to replace it. Lilia’s going to need us organized and prepared for the trial.”</p><p>“What are you suggesting?” Alice asked, pouring herself a cup of coffee.</p><p>“A shopping spree,” Wanda said with a grin. “We need laptops, printers, notebooks, paper—everything to rebuild our arsenal. And Billy,” she added, glancing at him, “you’re getting a new phone.”</p><p>Billy blinked in surprise. “Wait, what? My phone’s fine.”</p><p>“It’s not,” Wanda said firmly. “It’s slow, the battery barely lasts, and the screen is cracked. You need something reliable, especially with everything going on.”</p><p>“Wanda,” Rio interjected, “that’s...a lot.”</p><p>Wanda waved her hand dismissively. “I’ve got it covered. Money isn’t an issue, and frankly, I haven’t touched most of my family’s funds. It’s just sitting there. If I can use it to help us win this fight, why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>The group exchanged glances, unsure of how to respond. Jen leaned back in her chair, a teasing smirk on her lips. “So, you’re saying we’re about to be your spoiled little minions?”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes. “I’m saying we’re getting what we need to get this done. No more cutting corners.”</p><p>Billy hesitated. “Are you sure? A new phone sounds...expensive.”</p><p>“Billy,” Wanda said softly, placing a hand on his shoulder, “this isn’t just about the phone. It’s about making sure you’re equipped for whatever comes next. And besides, I want to do this for you.”</p><p>Billy’s cheeks flushed, and he nodded, mumbling, “Thanks, Wanda.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, her shoulders relaxing. “Alright, if you’re sure. But let’s keep it efficient. The sooner we get what we need, the sooner we can get back to work.”<br/><br/>~~~~~</p><p>After breakfast, the group split up to get ready for the day. Wanda handed out lists of essentials, delegating responsibilities to streamline the shopping trip.</p><p>“Billy and I will handle electronics—laptops, printers, and his phone,” Wanda said. “Agatha and Rio, you’re on office supplies. Alice and Jen, snacks and extras.”</p><p>Rio smirked at Agatha. “Ready to battle it out over the last pack of sticky notes?”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Just don’t fill the cart with glitter pens.”</p><p>“Glitter pens are non-negotiable,” Rio shot back, earning a laugh from Billy.</p><p>The electronics store was their first stop, and Billy’s eyes widened at the rows of sleek laptops and smartphones. Wanda guided him to the phone section, her gaze scanning the options.</p><p>“Pick one,” she said, gesturing to the display.</p><p>Billy hesitated. “You mean...any one?”</p><p>“Any one,” Wanda confirmed. “But make it practical. No neon lights.”</p><p>Billy grinned. “You’ve been hanging out with Rio too much.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled as he examined the phones, eventually settling on a sturdy, high-performance model. “This one?”</p><p>“Perfect,” Wanda said, nodding approvingly. “Now, laptops.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio and Agatha navigated the aisles of an office supply store. Rio tossed a pack of glitter pens into the cart, grinning mischievously. “Told you they were essential.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “If I find glitter on my files, you’re cleaning it up.”</p><p>“Deal,” Rio said, grabbing a stack of colorful sticky notes.</p><p>At the same time, Alice and Jen wandered through the snack aisle, their cart quickly filling with chips, chocolate, and trail mix.</p><p>“Think we have enough?” Alice asked, eyeing the growing pile.</p><p>“You can never have enough snacks,” Jen replied, adding a pack of gummy bears. “Besides, we need fuel for the late nights.”</p><p>The group met back at the checkout, their carts loaded with supplies. Wanda surveyed the haul with satisfaction. “This should cover everything.”</p><p>As they packed the car, Billy held up his new phone, a wide grin on his face. “I can’t believe this is mine.”</p><p>“Believe it,” Wanda said, ruffling his hair. “You deserve it.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at Wanda, her expression softening. “Thank you for this. For everything.”</p><p>Wanda shrugged, a faint smile on her lips. “Family looks out for each other.”</p><p>Back at the house, the group spent the afternoon setting up their new equipment and organizing their supplies. The air buzzed with energy and determination as they prepared for the challenges ahead.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the counter, watching Rio carefully arrange their new files. “Feeling ready?”</p><p>Rio smiled, a spark of excitement in her eyes. “More than ready.”</p><p>Wanda walked in, her arms full of snacks. “Alright, team. Let’s show Evanora what we’re made of.”</p><p>The group returned to Wanda’s house in high spirits, the car packed with their new laptops, office supplies, and enough snacks to sustain them for days. As they unloaded everything into the living room, Wanda couldn’t help but smile at the energy buzzing around them.</p><p>“Alright, everyone,” she said, clapping her hands. “Let’s get this place set up.”</p><p>Rio carried a stack of notebooks to the coffee table, dropping them with a thud. “This feels like we’re about to start an intense study group.”</p><p>“Except instead of exams, we’re taking down Evanora,” Alice quipped, placing a new printer by the corner of the room.</p><p>Billy opened a bag of chips, already munching as he helped Agatha organize the files they’d printed earlier. “Same level of stress, though.”</p><p>“Don’t remind me,” Agatha muttered, rolling her eyes. “Now, let’s focus. We’ve got a lot of work to do.”</p><p>The living room transformed into a makeshift war room, every surface covered with papers, laptops, and colorful sticky notes. Wanda set up a charging station for their new devices while Rio arranged the snacks into an impressive display on the side table.</p><p>“Anyone need a sugar rush?” Rio asked, holding up a pack of gummy bears.</p><p>“Not yet,” Jen replied, her eyes scanning a spreadsheet. “But keep them handy. I’m going to crash eventually.”</p><p>Agatha sat cross-legged on the floor, typing furiously on her laptop. “Rio, can you check the backup files? Make sure everything is accessible.”</p><p>“On it,” Rio said, sliding onto the couch and opening her laptop. “Give me ten minutes.”</p><p>Alice sat at the dining table with Jen, going through Rebecca and Jeff’s testimonies. “These are solid, but we need to connect them to Evanora’s direct actions,” Alice said, highlighting key points. “If we can prove her direct involvement, we’ve got her.”</p><p>As the hours passed, the group worked tirelessly, pausing only to grab handfuls of chips or sips of coffee. Wanda brought out plates of cookies she’d baked earlier, setting them down in the center of the room.</p><p>“Fuel for the troops,” she said with a grin.</p><p>Billy immediately reached for a cookie. “Wanda, you’re the best.”</p><p>“Flattery will get you more cookies,” she teased, ruffling his hair.</p><p>Rio leaned back on the couch, her eyes scanning the screen. “Okay, backup files are all there and organized. What’s next?”</p><p>Agatha glanced up from her laptop, her brow furrowed. “We need to cross-reference these with the conversion camp records Alice and Jen dug up.”</p><p>“On it,” Rio said, opening another folder. “Let’s connect the dots.”</p><p>As the evening wore on, the group’s focus intensified. The hum of laptops and the rustle of papers filled the room, punctuated by the occasional burst of conversation.</p><p>“I think I found something,” Jen said, her voice breaking the silence. She pointed to a highlighted section in one of the documents. “This donation trail—it links directly to one of Evanora’s shell companies.”</p><p>Alice leaned over, her eyes lighting up. “That’s it. That’s the connection we needed.”</p><p>Agatha and Wanda joined them, their expressions serious as they reviewed the document. “This is huge,” Agatha said, a note of excitement in her voice. “We can use this to prove her involvement.”</p><p>“Keep digging,” Wanda said. “There’s more where this came from.”</p><p>As the day passed, the group took a brief break, sprawled across the couches and chairs with snacks in hand. The exhaustion was evident, but so was the determination in their eyes.</p><p>Rio looked around, a small smile playing on her lips. “You know, for a group of misfits, we’re not doing too bad.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “High praise coming from you.”</p><p>“Don’t get used to it,” Rio teased, tossing a gummy bear at her.</p><p>Wanda leaned back, her gaze soft as she watched them. “We’re getting closer. I can feel it. Evanora won’t know what hit her.”</p><p>Billy, lying on the rug with a notebook in hand, grinned. “Let’s just make sure we hit her hard.”</p><p>With renewed energy, the group returned to their tasks, the living room buzzing with activity late into the night. Laptops clicked, papers rustled, and the scent of coffee lingered in the air.</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio, who was deep in concentration, her fingers flying across the keyboard. “Hey,” she said softly, catching her attention. “You’re doing great.”</p><p>Rio looked up, her smile faint but genuine. “So are you.”</p><p>As the hours ticked by, the group worked together seamlessly, their shared goal driving them forward. The fight wasn’t over, but in that moment, surrounded by their makeshift war room and each other’s determination, they felt unstoppable.</p><p>The hum of productivity filled the air, but as the clock ticked closer to night, the atmosphere began to shift. Exhaustion mixed with a strange sense of camaraderie, and the group’s conversation turned playful.</p><p>Rio leaned back on the couch, stretching her arms over her head. “You know,” she began, a smirk tugging at her lips, “if this were a movie, we’d be like some elite FBI team. You know, solving crimes, taking down bad guys.”</p><p>Billy perked up, grinning. “Dibs on being the tech genius.”</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “You mean the one who eats snacks while hacking into government databases?”</p><p>“Exactly!” Billy said, tossing a handful of chips into his mouth.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, though a smile played on her lips. “And let me guess, Rio—you're the rogue agent who doesn’t play by the rules?”</p><p>“Obviously,” Rio replied with mock arrogance. “I’d wear leather jackets, drive a cool car, and break all the protocols.”</p><p>Alice laughed. “That checks out. What about Agatha? What’s her role?”</p><p>Rio grinned, leaning toward Agatha. “She’s the boss, obviously. All work, no nonsense, and constantly yelling at me for going off-script.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, shaking her head. “You’ve got quite the imagination.”</p><p>“It’s not imagination,” Rio quipped. “It’s destiny.”</p><p>As the laughter faded, Agatha’s phone buzzed on the coffee table, drawing everyone’s attention. She glanced at the screen and saw Lilia’s name. Her heart skipped a beat as she picked up the call.</p><p>“Lilia,” Agatha greeted, her tone shifting to serious. “What’s going on?”</p><p>Lilia’s voice was calm but laced with urgency. “I have some updates. We’ve reviewed the footage from the accident.”</p><p>Agatha straightened, the room falling silent as everyone tuned in. “And?”</p><p>“We couldn’t make a clear identification,” Lilia admitted. “The figure is too obscured. But there’s something familiar about him.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Lilia hesitated. “This isn’t the first time we’ve seen him. He matches the description of the man who attacked you that night outside your apartment. He’s also the same figure spotted on the footage outside your building when Rio received those threats.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach churned. “And the threat to Alice’s dorm?”</p><p>“We believe he’s responsible for that as well,” Lilia confirmed. “Whoever he is, he’s been involved in every major incident tied to Evanora.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, her expression darkening. “So, he’s basically Evanora’s lapdog.”</p><p>“It seems that way,” Lilia said. “I’ve taken the liberty of hiring a private investigator to follow him. I want to know where he goes, who he meets, and what his role in all this is.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly. “Do you think he’s the one pulling the strings on the ground?”</p><p>“It’s a strong possibility,” Lilia replied. “But until we know more, we can’t rule anything out.”</p><p>Wanda, sitting beside Billy, spoke up. “Do you have any leads on his identity?”</p><p>“Not yet,” Lilia admitted. “But the PI is thorough. We should have updates soon.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her grip tightening on the phone. “Thanks, Lilia. Keep me posted.”</p><p>“Always,” Lilia said before ending the call.</p><p>Agatha set the phone down, her mind racing as the room descended into silence. Rio reached over, placing a hand on her knee. “We’ll get him,” she said softly. “Whoever he is, we’ll stop him.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, the weight of the situation reflected in her eyes. “It’s just...every time we think we’re making progress, something new comes up.”</p><p>“That’s how it works, isn’t it?” Wanda said, her voice steady. “We keep digging until there’s nothing left to hide.”</p><p>Alice leaned back, rubbing her temples. “This guy...he’s the missing piece. If we can figure out who he is, maybe we can take Evanora’s whole operation down.”</p><p>Billy spoke up, his voice quiet but determined. “What if he’s the one who...who caused the accident? He could’ve killed Rio and Alice.”</p><p>The words hung heavy in the air, the reality of their situation sinking in.</p><p>Agatha stood, pacing the room as she processed the call. “We need to stay focused,” she said, her voice firm. “Lilia’s right. This guy is dangerous, and we can’t underestimate him.”</p><p>Rio watched her, her heart aching at the tension etched into Agatha’s face. “We’ve got this,” she said, her tone soft but resolute. “We’re not backing down.”</p><p>Wanda stood as well, her gaze sweeping the group. “This is our fight. And we’re going to win.”</p><p>As the group exchanged determined looks, the air in the room seemed to shift. The fear and uncertainty were still there, but so was their unbreakable resolve. They were in this together, and nothing—not even Evanora’s shadowy enforcer—was going to stop them.</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>The night was winding down, the group scattered across Wanda’s living room, enjoying the rare moments of calm after a long day. Laptops were closed, papers stacked neatly, and the snack table had been reduced to a few empty bags and crumbs. Rio stretched her legs out on the couch, her head resting on Agatha’s shoulder, while Billy and Alice played cards on the rug.</p><p>A sharp knock at the door shattered the peace. Everyone froze, exchanging wary glances.</p><p>“I’ll get it,” Wanda said, standing. She smoothed her shirt as she walked to the door, her heart racing slightly. After everything they’d been through, an unexpected visitor was never a good sign.</p><p>When she opened the door, there was no one there—only a plain white envelope lying on the doorstep. Wanda bent to pick it up, her stomach sinking as she noticed her name scrawled across the front in neat, formal handwriting.</p><p>“What is it?” Agatha called from the living room.</p><p>Wanda didn’t answer immediately. She closed the door, her fingers trembling slightly as she opened the envelope. Inside was a folded letter and a small stack of photographs. Her eyes scanned the letter first, and the words hit her like a punch to the gut.</p><p>
<em>“Wanda Maximoff,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Effective immediately, your temporary guardianship of Billy Kaplan has been terminated. You are hereby ordered to return William Kaplan to his former foster family within 24 hours, the adress is attached. Failure to comply will result in police intervention and potential legal action.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Sincerely,</em>
<br/>
<em>Office of Child and Family Services”</em>
</p><p>Wanda’s hands shook as she read the letter again, disbelief and anger flooding her chest. She barely noticed the photographs slipping from her grasp and fluttering to the floor. When she finally looked down, the sight made her blood run cold.</p><p>There, in glossy black-and-white, were pictures of her, Billy, and Tommy at the café during their meeting. In one, Wanda was smiling warmly at Tommy, her hand resting on Billy’s shoulder. In another, the three of them were seated at the table, deep in conversation. The final photo showed them leaving the café together, their expressions serious.</p><p>“Unbelievable,” she muttered under her breath.</p><p>Wanda returned to the living room, her face pale and her fists clenched around the letter. Everyone turned to her, their conversations halting as they noticed her expression.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Agatha asked, sitting up straighter.</p><p>Wanda held up the letter. “This,” she said, her voice trembling with controlled fury. “This is what’s wrong.”</p><p>She handed the letter to Agatha, who read it quickly, her face darkening. “Un-fucking-believable,” Agatha said, slamming the letter down onto the coffee table.</p><p>“What does it say?” Billy asked, his voice small, his gaze darting between the adults.</p><p>Wanda knelt beside him, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder. “It’s from the state,” she said softly. “They’re saying I have to return you to your former foster family.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes widened, panic flashing across his face. “What? Why? I thought...I thought you were adopting me.”</p><p>“I am,” Wanda said firmly, her voice cracking. “This is just another one of Evanora’s games. She’s pulling strings to try and break us.”</p><p>Alice picked up the photographs from the floor, her expression hardening as she flipped through them. “They were watching us,” she said, her voice tight with anger. “Someone followed us to the café and took these.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, taking a photo from Alice’s hand. “They’re trying to use this against us,” she said. “Trying to paint it like...what? Like you’re recruiting kids?”</p><p>Wanda closed her eyes, her shoulders slumping. “It doesn’t matter what spin they’re putting on it. They’ve got the legal leverage to force Billy back into that horrible place.”</p><p>Billy’s voice wavered as he spoke. “I can’t go back there, Wanda. Please. I’ll run away if I have to.”</p><p>“You’re not going anywhere,” Wanda said fiercely, pulling him into a hug. “We’re going to fight this.”</p><p>Agatha stood, pacing the room. “This isn’t just about Billy. Evanora’s trying to divide us, distract us from the trial.”</p><p>“Well, it’s working,” Alice said bitterly, tossing the photos onto the table. “We’re running out of time.”</p><p>“Not yet,” Rio said, her tone resolute. She turned to Wanda. “Do we have anything—any legal recourse to block this?”</p><p>Wanda hesitated, her eyes flicking to Agatha. “I don’t know. But we need to talk to Lilia. She’ll know what to do.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I’ll call her first thing in the morning.”</p><p>Later that night, as the group disbanded to their rooms, Wanda sat alone in the living room, the letter and photographs spread out in front of her. Her mind raced with possible solutions, each one more desperate than the last.</p><p>Billy appeared in the doorway, clutching a blanket. “Can I...stay with you tonight?”</p><p>Wanda smiled, patting the seat beside her. “Of course.”</p><p>As Billy curled up beside her, Wanda placed a protective arm around him, her resolve hardening. No matter what Evanora threw at them, she wouldn’t let this family be torn apart.</p>

<p>The house was quiet, the others having retreated to their rooms to process the latest blow. Wanda sat on the couch, her arm wrapped around Billy, who was curled up against her side. The letter and photographs lay on the coffee table in front of them, a grim reminder of the battle ahead.</p><p>Billy fidgeted with the edge of his blanket, his head resting lightly on Wanda’s shoulder. “Do you think...they’ll really make me go back?” he asked softly, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Wanda tightened her hold on him, her heart aching at the fear in his tone. “I won’t let that happen,” she said firmly. “Not if I can help it.”</p><p>Billy hesitated, his fingers still tugging at the fabric. “But what if they win? What if I have to go back to—” He stopped, swallowing hard. “To them.”</p><p>Wanda turned slightly, tilting his chin up so he would look at her. “Billy, listen to me,” she said, her voice steady but gentle. “I will fight for you. I don’t care what it takes or how long it takes—I’m not letting them take you away.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes filled with tears, but he quickly wiped them away, refusing to let them fall. “You don’t know what it was like,” he said, his voice trembling. “They didn’t care about me. I was just...just another kid they had to take care of. And if I did anything wrong...”</p><p>He trailed off, his breathing uneven. Wanda rubbed soothing circles on his back, waiting for him to continue.</p><p>“They always said I was too much trouble,” Billy finally said. “That no one would ever want me. That I’d never find a real family.”</p><p>Wanda’s chest tightened, anger and sadness warring within her. “Billy,” she said softly, brushing a strand of hair out of his face. “They were wrong. So, so wrong.”</p><p>Billy looked up at her, his expression vulnerable. “What if they’re not? What if you realize I’m too much trouble too?”</p><p>Wanda cupped his face, her eyes brimming with unshed tears. “That’s never going to happen. You’re not too much trouble, Billy. You’re brave and smart and kind, and you deserve to be loved. I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Billy’s tears finally spilled over, and he buried his face in Wanda’s shoulder. “I don’t want to lose you,” he whispered.</p><p>“You won’t,” Wanda said, her voice breaking slightly as she held him close. “You’re stuck with me now, okay? No matter what happens, we’ll figure it out together.”</p><p>They sat in silence for a while, the weight of the moment settling around them. Wanda stroked Billy’s hair, her mind racing with plans and strategies. She wouldn’t let Evanora win—not this time.</p><p>After a few minutes, Billy pulled back slightly, his tears subsiding. “Do you think...do you think it’ll ever stop? All the bad stuff?”</p><p>Wanda gave him a small, sad smile. “I wish I could say yes,” she admitted. “But the truth is, life can be really hard sometimes. The bad stuff might never completely go away. But you don’t have to face it alone. Not anymore.”</p><p>Billy nodded, his gaze steady. “I guess...as long as I have you, it’ll be okay.”</p><p>Wanda kissed the top of his head. “It will be,” she said softly. “I promise.”</p><p>Billy yawned, his exhaustion catching up with him. “Can we stay here for a little while longer?” he asked, his voice drowsy.</p><p>“Of course,” Wanda said, pulling the blanket tighter around him. “As long as you need.”</p><p>As Billy drifted off to sleep against her shoulder, Wanda stared at the photographs on the table, her resolve hardening. Evanora might have the resources, the connections, and the ruthlessness to pull off these stunts, but Wanda had something stronger—her love for Billy and the family they were building together. She wouldn’t stop fighting until they were safe.</p><p>With a deep breath, Wanda leaned back against the couch, holding Billy close. Tomorrow would bring another battle, but tonight, she would savor this moment of quiet determination.<br/>
~~~~~~~~</p><p>The house had fallen silent, save for the occasional creak of the old floorboards and the distant hum of the refrigerator. Agatha sat at the small dining table, her hands wrapped around a steaming mug of tea. Her gaze was distant, her thoughts swirling like the steam rising from her cup.</p><p>She barely noticed Rio enter the room until the younger woman slid into the chair across from her, her dark eyes sharp and observant even in the dim light.</p><p>“Can’t sleep either?” Rio asked, resting her chin on her hand.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, a faint, tired smile tugging at her lips. “Too much going on in here.” She tapped her temple.</p><p>Rio leaned back, crossing her arms. “Yeah, I get that. Hard to turn it off.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment, her brow furrowing. “How are you holding up? Really?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her fingers drumming lightly against the table. “Honestly? I don’t know. It feels like every time we make progress, something—or someone—comes along to tear it down.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly. “Evanora knows exactly how to hit where it hurts.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened, a flicker of frustration crossing her face. “Yeah, well, I’d love to hit back. But it feels like we’re always playing catch-up.”</p><p>Agatha reached out, placing a hand on Rio’s. “You’re doing more than enough, Rio. Backing up the files, coming up with plans...none of us would still be in this fight without you.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened, but she shook her head. “It doesn’t feel like enough. Not when everyone’s hurting. Not when Billy might get dragged back to those people.” Her voice cracked slightly on the last word, and she looked away.</p><p>Agatha tightened her grip on Rio’s hand, her own voice trembling as she spoke. “You’re not the only one who feels that way. I keep thinking about all the things I could’ve done differently—should’ve done differently. If I hadn’t gone to confront Evanora, maybe none of this would’ve happened.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped back to Agatha’s, her expression fierce. “Hey. Don’t do that. You can’t blame yourself for what she’s done. She’s a monster, Agatha. You’re just...human.”</p><p>Agatha let out a bitter laugh. “A deeply flawed human.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, her voice softening. “We all are. But you know what? That’s okay. Because flawed or not, you’re still here, fighting for what’s right. For Billy, for Wanda, for me.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, her heart swelling at Rio’s words. “For you?”</p><p>“For you,” Rio repeated, her tone unwavering. “Because I love you, Agatha. And nothing—not Evanora, not her threats, not this whole mess—is going to change that.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes filled with tears, and she looked down at their joined hands. “I’m so scared, Rio. Scared that if we keep going like this, you’re going to get hurt—or worse.”</p><p>Rio reached up, cupping Agatha’s cheek and gently guiding her gaze back to her own. “I know you’re scared. I am too. But I’m not going anywhere. We’re in this together, Agatha. No matter what. I love you”</p><p>Agatha leaned into Rio’s touch, a tear slipping down her cheek. “I love you, too,” she whispered, the words feeling both terrifying and liberating. “And I’m not ready to lose you.”</p><p>“You won’t,” Rio promised. “We’re stronger than she thinks. And when this is all over, we’re going to build a life that she can’t touch. I swear.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her tears falling freely now. “Okay,” she said softly. “Okay.”</p><p>For a while, they sat in silence, their hands intertwined as they took comfort in each other’s presence. The weight of the world hadn’t lifted, but it felt just a little lighter knowing they weren’t carrying it alone.</p><p>As the night wore on, Agatha rested her head on Rio’s shoulder, her breathing evening out as the exhaustion finally caught up to her. Rio pressed a soft kiss to her hair, whispering, “We’ve got this.”</p><p>And in that moment, with the quiet of the house surrounding them and the storm of their fight temporarily at bay, they believed it.</p><h3>~~~~~~~~~~</h3><p>The morning sun filtered through the windows, casting soft, golden light across Wanda’s house. The others had already gathered in the kitchen, sipping coffee and quietly discussing the day ahead. The air was calm, a rare moment of peace amidst the chaos that had consumed their lives.</p><p>Agatha, however, noticed two notable absences. “Where’s Wanda? And Billy?” she asked, her tone curious but soft.</p><p>“They’re probably still asleep,” Rio suggested, pouring herself a second cup of coffee. “After everything, they deserve a bit of rest.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, setting down her mug. “I’ll go check on them.”</p><p>Agatha made her way down the hall, the house unusually quiet. When she reached Wanda’s door, she hesitated, her hand hovering over the handle before gently pushing it open.</p><p>Inside, Wanda and Billy lay asleep on the bed, wrapped in a cocoon of warmth and comfort. Billy was curled up in Wanda’s arms, his face relaxed, free of the usual tension that seemed to weigh him down. Wanda’s hand rested protectively on his back, her expression peaceful.</p><p>Agatha stood there for a moment, her chest tightening at the sight. The scene was so tender, so profoundly maternal, that it struck a chord deep within her. Wanda, who had lost so much, was giving Billy the love and safety he’d been denied for so long.</p><p>A small smile tugged at Agatha’s lips as she quietly stepped back and closed the door. She lingered in the hallway for a moment, the image of them etched in her mind.</p><p>On her way back to the kitchen, Agatha passed a door she hadn’t noticed before—or perhaps, she’d chosen not to notice. The door to Pietro’s room. It was slightly ajar, and a wave of curiosity and hesitation washed over her.</p><p>She pushed the door open slowly, stepping into a room frozen in time. Dust coated the furniture, the air carrying a faint mustiness of a space left untouched for years. The walls were lined with posters of bands and sports teams, and a collection of books sat neatly on the shelf.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were drawn to a photo frame on the nightstand. She picked it up, her breath catching at the image: Wanda, Pietro, and herself, grinning wildly on a roller coaster. Their hair was a mess, their eyes bright with joy. It was a snapshot of a simpler, happier time.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the bed, holding the photo in her hands. “Hey, Pietro,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “It’s been a while.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the photo, her thumb brushing over the glass. “I wish you were here,” she said softly. “Wanda could really use you right now. She’s been through so much, and she’s trying so hard to hold everything together. She’s...she’s amazing, you know? But I think she’s carrying more than she lets on.”</p><p>Her voice cracked slightly, and she took a deep breath to steady herself. “I’m doing my best to help her, to be there for her. But it’s not the same. She needs you, Pietro. Your ridiculous jokes, your way of making everything seem less scary. I try, but I’m not you.”</p><p>She set the photo back on the nightstand, her gaze lingering on it. “I miss you, you know. I think we all do. But Wanda...she misses you the most.”</p><p>Agatha stood, her fingers trailing along the edge of the bed as she took one last look around the room. “I’ll take care of her,” she said quietly. “I promise.”</p><p>When Agatha finally returned to the kitchen, Rio looked up from her laptop. “Everything okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, a small smile on her lips. “Yeah. Wanda and Billy are fine. Just...taking a well-deserved nap.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, sensing something deeper. “You sure you’re okay?”</p><p>Agatha leaned against the counter, her smile softening. “I’m fine. Just...thinking.”</p><p>Rio reached out, placing a hand on Agatha’s arm. “You don’t have to carry it all alone, you know.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, gratitude shining in her eyes. “I know. Thank you, my love.”</p><p>As they returned to their work, the house felt a little warmer, a little brighter. Even in the quiet moments of reflection, there was strength—and that strength would carry them through whatever came next.</p><h3>~~~~~~</h3><p>The house was quiet as the day began, with only the soft hum of activity in the kitchen breaking the silence. Agatha stood at the stove, flipping pancakes, while Alice sliced fruit for a colorful salad.</p><p>“You know,” Alice said, sneaking a piece of pineapple, “you’re surprisingly good at this domestic stuff, considering you’re supposed to be the ‘no-nonsense’ type.”</p><p>Agatha smirked without looking up from the pan. “I contain multitudes.”</p><p>“Sure you do,” Alice teased. “Just don’t get too comfortable. We’re not letting you turn into a kitchen goddess full-time.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, sliding a golden-brown pancake onto the growing stack. “As if.”</p><p>Nearby, Jen moved through the common areas, tidying up. She hummed softly as she worked, the clink of dishes and the occasional sound of a spray bottle punctuating the calm.</p><p>While the house remained otherwise quiet, Rio sat on the edge of her bed, tying her sneakers. The knock on her door was gentle but insistent, and she looked up to see the physiotherapist peeking in with a kind smile.</p><p>“Ready for today’s session?” the therapist asked.</p><p>Rio nodded, forcing a smile. “As ready as I’ll ever be.”</p><p>They moved to a cleared space in the room, where the therapist laid out a resistance band and some light weights. Rio stretched, wincing slightly at the ache in her muscles from the last session.</p><p>“Today, we’ll work on some standing balance and light weight-bearing exercises,” the therapist explained. “Nothing too intense, but it’s important to push just a little.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her determination masking the lingering frustration from the previous session. “Let’s do it.”</p><p>The session began with a simple balancing exercise. Rio managed to stand on one leg for longer than last time, though her trembling muscles gave her away. The therapist praised her progress, offering adjustments to her form.</p><p>Next came resistance band work, with Rio using her arms to pull the band taut while maintaining a steady posture. She succeeded in the first few reps but struggled toward the end, her frustration mounting.</p><p>“I should be able to do this,” Rio muttered under her breath.</p><p>“You’re doing great,” the therapist encouraged. “It’s about building strength over time, not overnight.”</p><p>By the end of the session, Rio’s body ached, but she’d made noticeable improvements. Still, the lingering feeling of inadequacy hung heavy over her.</p><p>“You’ve come a long way already,” the therapist said gently as they packed up. “Be patient with yourself.”</p><p>Rio offered a small smile. “Thanks. I’ll try.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Agatha and Alice had finished preparing breakfast, and the kitchen smelled of fresh pancakes, scrambled eggs, and bacon. Jen joined them, placing the last of the cleaned dishes on the rack.</p><p>“Breakfast is ready!” Agatha called out as she arranged the plates on the table.</p><p>Rio entered the kitchen, still visibly tired from her session but drawn by the inviting aroma. She moved stiffly, her body protesting every step, but she forced a smile.</p><p>“Looks amazing,” she said, sliding into a chair.</p><p>Agatha handed her a plate, her expression softening. “You look like you could use this. Eat up.”</p><p>Rio poked at her food with her fork. “I’m fine, really. Just tired.”</p><p>Agatha sat beside her, leaning in slightly. “How did the session go?”</p><p>“Better,” Rio admitted, though her voice carried a hint of doubt. “Still feels like I’m moving at a snail’s pace.”</p><p>“Progress is progress,” Agatha said firmly. “And for the record, I’m proud of you.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched into a faint smile. “Thanks, mi amor. That means a lot.”</p><p>As the group ate, the mood was calm and comfortable. The absence of Wanda and Billy was noticeable, but no one commented on it, knowing they needed the extra rest. Rio eventually relaxed, her plate empty and her shoulders less tense.</p><p>Jen, clearing the table, asked, “Do you think Wanda and Billy will be up soon?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Let them sleep. They’ve earned it.”</p><p>Rio glanced toward the hallway. “Think I’ll check on them later. For now, I need another cup of coffee.”</p><p>As Agatha poured her one, she caught Rio’s gaze and gave her a soft smile. They might have a long road ahead, but moments like these made it feel a little easier.</p><h3>~~~~~~~~</h3><p>The sun had risen fully by the time the group finished their breakfast. The kitchen buzzed with light conversation and clinking dishes as they cleared the table and settled into their morning routines. The only ones still absent were Wanda and Billy, still tucked away in Wanda’s room.</p><p>“I’ll go wake them,” Rio said, setting her empty coffee mug on the counter. “It’s been an hour, and we’ve got things to do.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips quirking into a smirk. “Good luck with that. Wanda is a bear before her first cup of coffee.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I’m not scared of her. Much.”</p><p>Rio made her way down the hall, pushing Wanda’s door open just enough to peek inside. The room was dimly lit by the soft glow of sunlight filtering through the curtains. Billy was awake, lying curled up against Wanda, who was still sound asleep. He noticed Rio and gave her a small wave, motioning for her to come in.</p><p>Rio slipped inside, closing the door softly behind her. She crouched next to the bed, keeping her voice low. “Morning, Teen. How’d you sleep?”</p><p>“Good,” Billy whispered, his voice hushed. “I didn’t want to get up and wake Wanda. She looked...peaceful.”</p><p>Rio smiled, brushing a hand through his hair. “That’s sweet of you. But you’ve got to get moving eventually, you know.”</p><p>Billy sighed, his face scrunching in protest. “I know, but can’t I just stay here a little longer? It’s nice.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened. “It’s okay to want that, Billy. But the world’s waiting, and so is breakfast. Agatha made pancakes.”</p><p>Billy grinned, his eyes lighting up. “Pancakes?”</p><p>“Yep,” Rio said. “But you better hurry before they’re gone.”</p><p>Billy glanced at Wanda, still sleeping beside him, her arm draped protectively over his shoulder. “I don’t want to wake her,” he murmured. “She’s been so tired.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, her smile tinged with pride. “You’re a good kid, Billy.”</p><p>As Rio and Billy whispered, Wanda stirred, her brow furrowing slightly before her eyes fluttered open. She blinked a few times, her gaze landing on Billy first, then Rio.</p><p>“What’s going on?” she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.</p><p>“Good morning, Sleeping Beauty,” Rio teased, standing up. “We were just talking about letting you sleep forever.”</p><p>Wanda sat up slowly, rubbing her eyes. “Forever sounds good, honestly.”</p><p>Billy chuckled, sitting up as well. “Rio said Agatha made pancakes.”</p><p>Wanda gave a small, sleepy smile. “Well, that’s incentive enough to get out of bed, I guess.”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, smirking. “Come on, Maximoff. Time to join the land of the living.”</p><p>Wanda stretched, groaning slightly. “Fine, fine. But if there’s no coffee ready, I’m going back to sleep.”</p><p>As Wanda and Billy got up and made their way out of the room, Rio followed behind, feeling a sense of calm settle over her. Despite the chaos surrounding their lives, moments like this reminded her that they had each other—and that was enough to face whatever came next.</p><p>When they entered the kitchen, the smell of coffee and leftover pancakes greeted them. Agatha looked up from her seat, smirking. “Took you long enough.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes, heading straight for the coffee pot. “Don’t push it, Harkness.”</p><p>Billy, meanwhile, made a beeline for the stack of pancakes, his enthusiasm drawing a laugh from Alice.</p><p>As the group settled back into their routines, the house buzzed with quiet energy, a comforting rhythm that kept them moving forward.</p><p>The morning sunlight poured into the kitchen, casting a warm glow over the room as the group finished their breakfast. Billy sat beside Wanda, finishing his pancakes with a contented smile, though his eyes betrayed the weight of the day ahead.</p><p>“What do you want to do today?” Wanda asked, her voice gentle but light.</p><p>Billy shrugged, trying to mask his unease. “I don’t know. Just...something fun.”</p><p>Wanda’s lips quirked into a small smile. She could sense the hesitation in his tone, the unspoken worry about what was to come. “Alright,” she said, determination settling in her voice. “Fun it is. You get to call the shots today.”</p><p>Billy’s smile grew a little wider. “Really? Anything?”</p><p>“Anything,” Wanda promised, her voice warm and full of love.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Wanda and Billy spent the day exploring the town, starting with a walk through the park. They stopped to watch a group of kids playing soccer, Billy’s face lighting up at the sight.</p><p>“You ever play?” Wanda asked, nudging him gently.</p><p>“A little,” Billy replied. “I wasn’t very good, though.”</p><p>“Maybe we’ll get you back out there someday,” Wanda said with a soft smile, ruffling his hair.</p><p>Later, they wandered into a small arcade, where Billy challenged Wanda to a game of air hockey. His laughter filled the room as he scored the winning goal, throwing his hands up in victory.</p><p>“You’re too competitive,” Wanda teased, crossing her arms.</p><p>“Or maybe you’re just bad at it,” Billy retorted with a playful grin.</p><p>They stopped at a cozy café for lunch, sitting by the window as they ate their sandwiches and shared a milkshake. The conversation was light at first, but as the minutes ticked by, the reality of the day began to creep in.</p><p>“This is the best day I’ve had in...a long time,” Billy said softly, tracing patterns on the table with his finger.</p><p>Wanda’s chest tightened. “You deserve days like this all the time,” she said. “Not just once in a while.”</p><p>Billy shrugged. “I don’t know. This feels pretty amazing to me.”</p><p>Wanda reached across the table, taking his hand in hers. “You’re amazing, Billy. Don’t forget that.”</p><p>As the afternoon turned to evening, the time to take Billy back arrived. Agatha, who had been keeping herself busy around the house, appeared in the living room as Wanda grabbed her keys.</p><p>“Do you want me to come with you?” Agatha asked softly.</p><p>Wanda hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “Yeah. I think I’d like that.”</p><p>The drive to Billy’s foster home was quiet, the atmosphere heavy with unspoken emotions. Agatha sat in the passenger seat, her presence a steady source of comfort for Wanda, who kept her focus on the road.</p><p>When they arrived, Wanda parked in front of the house and turned to Billy. “Do you want me to come in with you?” she asked gently.</p><p>Billy shook his head, his voice small. “No. I’ll be okay.”</p><p>Billy leaned over, wrapping Wanda in a tight hug. “Thank you,” he whispered. “For everything.”</p><p>Wanda held him close, her voice trembling as she said, “I’ll see you soon, Billy. This isn’t the end.”</p><p>He pulled back, giving her a small, brave smile before turning to Agatha. “Thanks for looking out for Wanda. She needed you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her throat tight. “Take care of yourself, Teen. We’ve got your back.”</p><p>Billy nodded and stepped out of the car, his steps hesitant as he approached the house. Wanda and Agatha watched until he disappeared inside, the door closing behind him.</p><p>As Wanda started the car, Agatha placed a hand on her arm. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Wanda exhaled slowly, looking at the the steering wheel. “I don’t know. But I’m glad you came with me.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her gaze steady. “You’re not alone in this, Wanda. We’ll get through it.”</p><p>Wanda smiled faintly, tears glistening in her eyes. “Thanks, Agatha.”</p><p>The car hummed softly as Wanda drove back from Billy’s foster home, her hands gripping the steering wheel tightly. The sun was beginning to set, casting warm hues of gold and orange across the sky. Agatha sat in the passenger seat, her gaze out the window, but her attention was on Wanda.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Agatha asked softly, breaking the silence.</p><p>Wanda let out a shaky breath, her lips pressing into a thin line. “I don’t know. It feels...wrong. Leaving him there. Like I’ve failed him.”</p><p>“You haven’t,” Agatha said firmly. “You’re doing everything you can for him. And he knows that.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, though her grip on the wheel didn’t loosen. “He’s so much like Pietro,” she murmured, almost to herself.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, her heart tightening. “I’ve been thinking the same thing.”</p><p>When they arrived back at Wanda’s house, the others gave them space, sensing the weight of the evening. Wanda and Agatha found themselves sitting in the quiet of the living room, mugs of tea warming their hands.</p><p>Agatha broke the silence first. “Billy...he has that same spark. That same...unrelenting energy that Pietro had.”</p><p>Wanda smiled faintly, her eyes distant as she thought of her twin. “He does, doesn’t he? The way he lights up when he’s happy, the way he’s always looking for ways to make people smile...it’s uncanny.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her own smile soft and wistful. “Do you remember that summer we all went to the fair? Pietro insisted on trying every single ride, even though you two hated the spinning ones.”</p><p>Wanda laughed lightly, the sound tinged with both joy and sorrow. “I remember. He dragged me onto that tilt-a-whirl, and I was so dizzy I couldn’t walk straight for an hour. And then he bought me cotton candy to make up for it.”</p><p>“And then he ate half of it,” Agatha added, chuckling.</p><p>Wanda’s laugh deepened, her shoulders relaxing slightly. “He was always like that. Always full of life, full of...chaos.”</p><p>The laughter faded, replaced by a comfortable silence. Wanda stared into her tea, her expression growing somber. “I miss him so much,” she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “It’s been years, and it still hurts like it was yesterday.”</p><p>Agatha reached over, placing a hand on Wanda’s arm. “I know. I miss him too. He was...he was one of the best parts of my life.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes filled with tears, but she blinked them back, a bittersweet smile on her lips. “Do you think he’d be proud of me? Of us?”</p><p>“Absolutely,” Agatha said without hesitation. “He’d be proud of how strong you are, of how fiercely you love. And he’d be thrilled that you’re taking care of Billy. He’d probably say something cocky like, ‘Of course you’re doing amazing—it’s in our blood.’”</p><p>Wanda laughed softly, a tear slipping down her cheek. “That sounds exactly like him.”</p><p>They sat together, lost in their memories, the weight of Pietro’s absence lingering but somehow less suffocating in each other’s presence. Wanda wiped her eyes, her expression resolute.</p><p>“I’m not giving up on Billy,” she said firmly. “No matter what Evanora or anyone else throws at us, I’m going to fight for him.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her own determination mirrored in her eyes. “And I’ll be right there with you. We’ll fight for him together.”</p><p>Wanda smiled, a genuine warmth in her gaze. “Thank you, Aggie. For everything.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her arm gently. “Always.”</p><p>As the evening deepened, the two women sat together, their bond strengthened by shared memories and a shared purpose. Pietro might have been gone, but his spirit lived on—in their hearts, and in the boy they were determined to protect.</p><h3>~~~~~~~</h3><p>The atmosphere in Wanda’s house was tense as Alice, Jen, and Rio huddled around the dining table. Laptops, scattered papers, and empty coffee cups covered every surface. The group was laser-focused, their whispered conversations punctuated by the rhythmic tapping of keyboards.</p><p>Rio leaned back in her chair, running a hand through her hair. “Alright,” she said, her voice low but firm. “If we’re going to sell this, we need to sound desperate. Like we’re barely holding on.”</p><p>Alice, sitting beside her, nodded. “Desperate but not too weak. We want them to think we’re broken, but not so much that they won’t consider negotiating.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Jen added, glancing at her laptop screen. “We need to dangle just enough to make them curious but not enough to make them think we’re bluffing.”</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, her fingers drumming on the table. “This has to work. We don’t have time to second-guess.”</p><p>Alice leaned over her laptop, her fingers flying across the keyboard as she typed the draft of the email. “How’s this sound?”</p><p>
<em>To the Legal Team of Evanora Harkness,</em>
</p><p>
<em>This is in regard to the ongoing case against Ms. Harkness. After recent events, it has become clear that pursuing this matter further could lead to significant personal and professional consequences for our team.</em>
</p><p>
<em>We are reaching out to discuss the possibility of a plea deal or alternative resolution that would be mutually beneficial. We are prepared to drop certain aspects of our investigation in exchange for assurances that will allow all parties to move forward without further escalation.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Please let us know if this is a discussion you are willing to have.</em>
</p><p>Alice looked up, her expression cautious. “Thoughts?”</p><p>Rio frowned, tapping her chin. “It’s good, but it might be too formal. We want to sound desperate, not professional.”</p><p>Jen nodded in agreement. “We need to add more personal stakes. Make it seem like we’re on the verge of falling apart.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, rephrasing some of the lines. “What about this?”</p><p>
<em>This case is destroying us. We’ve lost valuable resources, and some of us are even fearing for our safety. We’re exhausted, and it’s clear that continuing down this road will only make things worse for everyone.</em>
</p><p>
<em>We’re willing to talk about a deal that could work for both sides. If there’s any way to avoid further damage, we’re open to hearing it.</em>
</p><p>Alice read over the changes, nodding slowly. “That hits harder. It’s personal and raw.”</p><p>Jen frowned slightly. “But do you think they’ll believe it? We’re essentially telling them we’re weak.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “That’s the point. If Evanora thinks she’s already won, she’ll lower her guard. That’s what we need.”</p><p>Alice hesitated, then nodded. “Alright. Let’s do it.”</p><p>The three of them reviewed the email one final time, making minor tweaks and ensuring every word conveyed the sense of desperation they needed to sell. Rio hovered over the send button, her finger poised but hesitant.</p><p>“This is it,” she said, glancing at Alice and Jen. “Once we send this, there’s no going back.”</p><p>Alice placed a hand on her shoulder. “We’ve got this, Rio. They’ll take the bait.”</p><p>Jen crossed her arms, her voice steady. “And if they don’t, we’ll find another way. We always do.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, then clicked send. The email disappeared from the screen, leaving behind a heavy silence.</p><p>As the three women sat back, the weight of what they’d just done settled over them. Rio leaned her head against the back of her chair, her eyes closed.</p><p>“Now we wait,” she muttered.</p><p>Alice tapped her fingers on the table, her nerves evident. “Do you think they’ll respond?”</p><p>“They will,” Jen said confidently. “Evanora doesn't seem like the woman who could resist the opportunity to gloat. She’ll want to see us beg.”</p><p>Rio opened her eyes, a bitter smile tugging at her lips. “Good. Let her. The more she underestimates us, the better.”</p><p>As the evening wore on, the tension in the room remained palpable. The sound of the clock ticking seemed louder than usual, each second dragging on as they waited for a reply.</p><p>Alice broke the silence, her voice hesitant. “Do you think we’re doing the right thing? Lying like this?”</p><p>Rio looked at her, her expression firm. “It’s not lying. It’s strategy. Evanora’s been playing dirty from the start. We’re just evening the playing field.”</p><p>Jen nodded in agreement. “Sometimes, to beat someone like her, you have to think like her.”</p><p>Alice sighed, but she didn’t argue. “I just hope it works.”</p>

<p>The email had been sent, and the room was quiet, the air thick with unspoken tension. Rio, Alice, and Jen sat around the table, their expressions a mix of exhaustion and determination. The glow from their laptops cast faint shadows across their faces, amplifying the gravity of their conversation.</p><p>“So,” Alice began, breaking the silence, “what do we do if Evanora’s team actually responds? What if they offer us a deal?”</p><p>Rio leaned back in her chair, her arms crossed. “Depends on the deal. If it’s something reasonable, maybe we consider it.”</p><p>Jen snorted softly. “Reasonable? From Evanora? You really think she’s capable of that?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, her lips pressing into a thin line. “I don’t know. But we need to be prepared for whatever she throws at us.”</p><p>Alice leaned forward, her hands clasped together on the table. “Let’s say she offers us something like a plea deal. Maybe we plead guilty to...I don’t know, defamation or some lesser charge. What then?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened, and she exhaled sharply through her nose. “That would mean admitting we’re wrong. That everything we’ve uncovered, everything we’ve fought for, was a lie. I don’t think I could stomach that.”</p><p>“But,” Jen interjected, her tone measured, “it could also mean an end to all this. No more threats, no more attacks. We’d be safe.”</p><p>“Safe?” Rio snapped, her frustration bubbling to the surface. “Do you really think Evanora would stop? She’s not the type to forgive and forget. If we back down now, she’ll just find another way to destroy us.”</p><p>Alice chewed her lip, her gaze distant. “But what if taking the deal saves Billy? What if it keeps him out of her reach?”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened at the mention of Billy, her voice lowering. “I get it. Believe me, I do. But if we give in now, we’re letting her win. We’re letting her keep hurting people like Billy, like Tommy, like all those kids she’s trying to ‘fix’ with her camps.”</p><p>Jen sighed, rubbing her temples. “It’s a moral dilemma. Do we sacrifice our principles for safety? Or do we risk everything to stand by them?”</p><p>Rio’s voice was firm as she replied. “We stand by them. If we don’t, what’s the point of all this? We’re fighting for something bigger than ourselves.”</p><p>Alice tilted her head, her brows knitting together. “But what if the deal isn’t about guilt? What if it’s something else—like a settlement? We drop the lawsuit, she leaves us alone.”</p><p>Jen considered this, her tone skeptical. “And what’s stopping her from coming after us anyway? She’s already shown she doesn’t play by the rules.”</p><p>“She’d have to sign something legally binding,” Alice argued. “Something that keeps her from retaliating.”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “And you trust her to honor that? This is Evanora we’re talking about.”</p><p>The conversation continued, each of them voicing their fears and doubts, weighing the risks and rewards. By the time the clock struck midnight, they were no closer to a definitive plan, but something had shifted.</p><p>Rio leaned forward, her gaze steady as she looked at Alice and Jen. “Whatever happens, we stick together. No one makes a decision alone. If we agree to something, it’s because we all agreed. Deal?”</p><p>Alice nodded, her eyes filled with determination. “Deal.”</p><p>Jen extended her hand, and the three of them shook on it. “We’re in this together,” she said firmly. “No matter what.”</p><p>As the others began packing up for the night, Rio lingered at the table, staring at the sent email on her screen. She knew they were taking a huge risk, but it was one they had to take.</p><p>Agatha’s voice echoed in her mind: <em>You’re doing more than enough, Rio. Don’t forget that.</em></p><p>With a deep breath, Rio closed her laptop and stood, her resolve solidifying. Whatever deal Evanora offered—if she offered one at all—they would face it head-on.</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>Wanda and Agatha drove in silence for most of the trip back. The emotional weight of leaving Billy behind lingered between them, heavy and unrelenting. Wanda kept her eyes fixed on the road, her knuckles white against the steering wheel, while Agatha occasionally glanced her way, wanting to say something but unsure of what.</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha finally asked, breaking the silence.</p><p>Wanda let out a long breath, her lips pressing into a thin line. “Not really,” she admitted. “But I’ll be fine. Eventually.”</p><p>Agatha reached over, resting a hand on Wanda’s shoulder. “We’ll get him back. This isn’t over.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, though her grip on the wheel didn’t loosen. “I know. It just...it never gets easier, you know?”</p><p>When they pulled up in front of the house, the soft glow of the living room lights greeted them. Wanda turned off the engine, staring at the house for a moment before finally exhaling and stepping out of the car. Agatha followed, carrying a bag of leftovers from the café where they had stopped for a quick dinner on the way back.</p><p>As they stepped inside, the sound of murmured conversation and the occasional clatter of dishes greeted them. Rio, Alice, and Jen were still gathered in the living room, their laptops and papers spread out across the coffee table.</p><p>“Welcome back,” Rio said, looking up with a tired smile. “How’d it go?”</p><p>Wanda shrugged, her expression guarded. “It went. Billy’s safe, for now.”</p><p>Agatha set the bag of food on the kitchen counter before joining the others. “What about here? Any updates?”</p><p>Alice leaned back in her chair, glancing at Rio. “We sent the email to Evanora’s team. Made it sound like we’re desperate for a deal.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her expression unreadable. “Now we wait.”</p><p>Wanda frowned, her brow furrowing. “Do you think they’ll take the bait?”</p><p>“They’ll respond,” Agatha said confidently. “Evanora can’t resist the chance to gloat or think she has the upper hand.”</p><p>Wanda sank into the armchair, her exhaustion evident. “And if she offers a deal? What’s the plan?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened, and she exchanged a look with Alice and Jen. “We’re still figuring that out,” she admitted. “But whatever we do, it’s going to be on our terms.”</p><p>The group fell into a comfortable silence, the tension of the day easing slightly in each other’s presence. Agatha leaned back against the couch, her gaze drifting to Wanda.</p><p>“You did good today,” Agatha said softly. “Billy knows you’re fighting for him.”</p><p>Wanda’s lips twitched into a faint smile. “I hope so. He deserves to feel safe.”</p><p>“He will,” Agatha replied. “Once this is over, we’ll make sure of it.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, breaking the heavy mood. “Alright, enough doom and gloom. Who’s hungry? We’ve got leftovers.”</p><p>The group chuckled softly, grateful for the brief reprieve. As they shared the meal, the house felt a little warmer, their bond a little stronger. They might not have all the answers yet, but together, they were ready to face whatever came next.</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>The air in Wanda’s house was thick with tension as the group gathered around the dining table, staring at the laptop screen. The minutes dragged by until finally, Alice’s inbox pinged with a new email.</p><p>Everyone tensed.</p><p>Alice clicked the email, scanning it quickly before reading aloud:</p><p>From: Harkness Legal Affairs<br/>
To: [Alice Wu-Gulliver, Rio Vidal, Agatha Harkness, Jennifer…]<br/>
Subject: RE: Discussion of Possible Resolution</p><p>We have reviewed your request and are open to discussing a potential resolution. Our client is willing to meet with your representatives in person at our firm’s offices in a few hours to explore terms for a possible agreement.</p><p>If your team agrees, we expect two designated representatives to attend. No additional parties. Any deviation from this will result in the offer being rescinded.</p><p>We look forward to your timely response.</p><p>The room was silent for a beat.</p><p>“They took the bait,” Jen murmured.</p><p>“Or they’re setting one,” Wanda countered darkly.</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, eyes locked on the screen. “So who’s going?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, already knowing the answer. “You and me.”</p><p>Alice frowned. “Are you sure? You’re Evanora’s main target.”</p><p>Agatha met Alice’s gaze steadily. “Exactly. She’ll be too focused on me to pay attention to what Rio’s doing.”</p><p>Rio smirked slightly. “And I know how to read her legal team. If there’s a trap, I’ll spot it.”</p><p>Wanda still looked uneasy. “I don’t like it.”</p><p>Jen shrugged. “There’s no good option here. If we send anyone else, we lose the psychological edge.”</p><p>Alice sighed, running a hand through her hair. “Alright. Agatha and Rio it is.”</p><p>“Let’s get this straight,” Rio said, sitting up. “What’s our goal here?”</p><p>“We make them talk,” Agatha replied. “We let them believe we’re broken, desperate. We get them comfortable.”</p><p>“And then?” Jen prompted.</p><p>Agatha smirked. “We bleed them for information.”</p><p>Alice nodded, opening her laptop. “Okay, but we need to be clear—what don’t we do?”</p><p>Rio’s expression darkened. “We don’t sign anything. We don’t promise anything.”</p><p>“And we don’t admit to anything,” Agatha added.</p><p>Wanda chewed her lip. “What if they dangle something big? What if they offer a deal that gets Billy out?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Rio sighed. “Then we stall. We say we need time. We don’t commit.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “We control the conversation. Not them.”</p><p>“Let’s run a scenario,” Jen suggested. “Wanda, you be the legal team.”</p><p>Wanda straightened, her tone turning sharp. “Miss Harkness, Miss Vidal. We’re willing to offer you an extremely generous deal.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes. “Define ‘generous.’”</p><p>Wanda smirked. “Drop the lawsuit. Withdraw all accusations against our client, and in exchange, your lives go back to normal. No lawsuits. No retaliation. No consequences.”</p><p>Agatha let out a low chuckle, leaning back in her chair. “And you expect us to just trust that?”</p><p>Wanda’s smirk widened. “It’ll be in writing.”</p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow. “But legally, that wouldn’t stop Evanora from targeting us later.”</p><p>Jen nodded. “You need to lead them into admitting they can’t actually guarantee our safety unless we take the deal. Make them show their cards.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “I can do that.”</p><p>Wanda crossed her arms. “What if they try to pressure you?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “We lean into it. The more they think we’re struggling, the more careless they’ll be.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, rolling her shoulders. “And if it’s a trap?”</p><p>Jen answered. “Then you get the hell out.”</p><p>Alice nodded. “Don’t be heroes. If anything feels wrong, walk away.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Who, me? I’m always careful.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “Says the woman who’s been kidnapped twice.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “First of all, rude.”</p><p>The next hour was spent finalizing their strategy.</p><p>Alice prepped a fake file, something that <em>looked</em> like crucial evidence in case they needed to bait the legal team into revealing information.</p><p>Jen ensured their phones were pre-set to record audio without alerting anyone.</p><p>Wanda checked in with Lilia, confirming that if anything went wrong, she’d be ready to act.</p><p>Agatha dressed sharp but understated, while Rio stuck to her usual messy-but-presentable style.</p><p>Before they left, Wanda stopped Agatha at the door.</p><p>“You sure about this?” Wanda asked, her voice softer now.</p><p>Agatha’s smirk faded into something more serious. “I know what I’m doing, Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda sighed. “Yeah. That’s what worries me.”</p><p>Across the room, Rio was rolling her eyes at Alice. “Stop looking at me like that.”</p><p>“I just know you’re going to say something that gets you punched,” Alice muttered.</p><p>Rio grinned. “I consider it my best quality.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Come on, let’s go play nice.”</p><p>With that, they walked out the door, heading straight into enemy territory.</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>Agatha and Rio stepped into the lobby of Evanora's firm, a sleek, modern building that reeked of wealth and power. The glass walls and polished floors reflected their images back at them—Agatha looking poised and in control, Rio looking like she wanted to punch something.</p><p>The receptionist, an immaculately dressed woman with sharp features, barely looked up from her computer. “Miss Harkness. Miss Vidal. You’re expected. Please follow me.”</p><p>As they walked down a long, silent corridor, Rio leaned in slightly toward Agatha. “You ever get the feeling you’re walking into a Bond villain’s lair?”</p><p>Agatha smirked but kept her voice low. “We are.”</p><p>The receptionist led them into a conference room that screamed intimidation—dark wood table, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city, and at the far end, three lawyers in expensive suits sat waiting for them.</p><p>And, of course, Evanora Harkness stood by the window, her back to them, sipping from a delicate teacup.</p><p>“Well, well,” Evanora said, finally turning. “Look who decided to come crawling.”</p><p>Rio clenched her jaw, but Agatha stepped forward smoothly, pulling out a chair and sitting down as if she owned the place. “Let’s not waste time, Mother. We both know this meeting isn’t about <em>us</em> crawling—it’s about you trying to clean up your mess.”</p><p>Evanora’s lips curled into a small smile. “Still so arrogant. It’s a wonder you still have friends.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch. “Let’s get to business.”</p><p>One of the lawyers, a middle-aged man with graying hair, cleared his throat. “Miss Harkness. Miss Vidal. Our client is open to discussing a resolution that will be beneficial for all parties. Given the… hostility of the current situation, we believe it is in everyone’s best interest to put an end to this legal dispute before it escalates further.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms. “And what exactly does ‘put an end’ mean?”</p><p>The lawyer adjusted his glasses. “A settlement.”</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow. “A settlement? Are you serious? That’s what you brought us here for?”</p><p>Evanora’s smile didn’t waver. “It’s quite generous, I assure you.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “You haven’t even told us what it is yet. But let me guess—it involves us backing off.”</p><p>The lawyer kept his professional tone. “If you drop your claims, we will ensure that you and your associates face no further consequences. No lawsuits, no career repercussions, no investigations into your activities.”</p><p>Rio’s hands clenched into fists. “Our activities?” she repeated, voice dripping with disbelief. “You’re acting like we’re the criminals here.”</p><p>Evanora’s expression didn’t change. “Aren't you, Miss Vidal? Actions have consequences, dear.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “And yet you never seem to face yours.”</p><p>The second lawyer, a younger woman with icy blue eyes, spoke next. “You may not be aware of just how much trouble you and your… associates are in. If this goes to trial, your past actions will be scrutinized. Miss Vidal, I assume you’d like to keep your scholarship?”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes. “You’re threatening my education now?”</p><p>The lawyer gave a polite, condescending smile. “Not at all. We’re simply making you aware of the… potential consequences.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk grew sharper. “So let me get this straight. You want us to drop everything while you hold our lives hostage?”</p><p>Evanora sipped her tea. “Oh, Agatha, don’t be dramatic.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes darkened. “I learned it from you.”</p><p>The third lawyer, a stern-looking man, spoke up for the first time. “If you refuse this settlement, you should be aware that further legal action will be taken against your group.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “Further legal action? Meaning what? You’re going to sue us?”</p><p>The lawyer adjusted his tie. “We have grounds to pursue defamation cases against every one of you. Not to mention, some of your group’s activities—such as hacking into private records, unauthorized surveillance, and harassment—could result in criminal charges.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “That’s rich, coming from Evanora. You’re really going to sit here and talk about illegal activities?”</p><p>Evanora finally set her tea down and folded her hands in front of her. “I’m giving you an out, Agatha. Take it.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw was tight, but she kept her voice controlled. “And if we don’t?”</p><p>The female lawyer responded smoothly. “Then you should prepare for a very long and very public legal battle.”</p><p>Agatha and Rio exchanged a glance. They were both thinking the same thing.</p><p>Evanora was getting desperate.</p><p>If she truly had the upper hand, she wouldn’t be offering them a settlement. She’d be crushing them outright.</p><p>Agatha turned back to Evanora, her expression unreadable. “This is a lot to process. We’ll need time to consider.”</p><p>Evanora smirked. “Of course. But don’t take too long.”</p><p>Rio shot back, “Why? You got somewhere to be?”</p><p>Evanora’s smirk widened. “Oh, I always do.”</p><p>The lawyers handed them a formal offer in writing, neatly typed and filled with legal jargon meant to confuse and intimidate. Rio barely looked at it before stuffing it into her bag.</p><p>Agatha stood first, smoothing out her blazer. “This was fun. Let’s not do it again.”</p><p>Evanora gave her an infuriatingly calm smile. “Oh, I have a feeling we will.”</p><p>Agatha and Rio turned and walked out, neither speaking until they reached the elevator. The moment the doors closed, Rio let out a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding.</p><p>“Jesus. I wanted to throw that tea in her face.”</p><p>Agatha let out a humorless chuckle. “Same. But we learned something today.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. She’s scared.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk was sharp. “Exactly.”</p><p>The elevator dinged, and the doors slid open. They had decisions to make.</p><p>And war to prepare for.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>Agatha and Rio sat in the back of the cab, the city lights flashing through the windows. The paper detailing Evanora’s so-called settlement offer sat between them, untouched. Neither had spoken since leaving the office.</p><p>Rio drummed her fingers against her knee, her energy vibrating with frustration. “I should’ve thrown that tea in her face.”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft chuckle. “You already said that in the elevator.”</p><p>“Well, I’m saying it again.” Rio turned her head, looking at Agatha. “You good?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze was fixed out the window, her jaw tight. “Just trying to wrap my head around it.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “What’s there to wrap your head around? It’s a shit deal.”</p><p>Agatha finally turned to face her. “It’s not about the deal. It’s about the fact that she’s offering one at all.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Meaning?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into a small smirk. “She’s losing control. If she were as untouchable as she pretends to be, she wouldn’t need to negotiate. The fact that she’s even considering a settlement means she’s afraid of what’s coming.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly. “Yeah, I got that vibe too. But we still have to be careful. If we reject this outright, she’s gonna come at us even harder.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Oh, absolutely. This isn’t her surrendering. This is her buying time.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened. “Then we make sure she doesn’t get it.”</p><p>When they arrived back at Wanda’s house, the rest of the group was already waiting for them in the living room.</p><p>Wanda, Jen, and Alice were all on edge, their gazes snapping toward the door as soon as Agatha and Rio walked in.</p><p>“You’re back,” Wanda said, standing up. “How bad was it?”</p><p>Agatha set the offer down on the coffee table. “Read for yourself.”</p><p>Alice grabbed it first, her eyes scanning the document quickly. As she read, her expression twisted into something between anger and disbelief.</p><p>“This is insane,” she muttered. “They’re basically saying, ‘Let Evanora walk, and we’ll pretend we didn’t ruin your lives.’”</p><p>“Sounds about right,” Rio said, flopping onto the couch. “Oh, and they threw in a few veiled threats for fun.”</p><p>Jen snatched the paper next, her lips curling as she skimmed it. “This is bullshit. If we sign this, it means she never faces consequences.”</p><p>Wanda, who had been sitting quietly, asked softly, “But… what happens if we don’t sign?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Agatha finally spoke. “Then she comes after us harder.”</p><p>Wanda rubbed her temples. “Alright. Let’s go through this logically. What exactly did they offer?”</p><p>Rio leaned forward. “A settlement—which means they think they have something, but they aren’t sure if it’ll hold in court. They’re trying to scare us into backing down.”</p><p>Jen exhaled. “And the threats?”</p><p>Agatha folded her arms. “They tried to pull legal intimidation—said we could face lawsuits, that they could come after our careers, scholarships, reputations.”</p><p>Alice narrowed her eyes as Agatha continued. “That’s classic Evanora. Make you question if fighting back is worth it.”</p><p>Wanda glanced at Agatha. “And what do you think?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Oh, I think we push harder.”</p><p>Jen grinned. “That’s what I like to hear.”</p><p>Rio, however, didn’t look entirely convinced. “Okay, but hear me out—what if we use this?”</p><p>Everyone turned to her.</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean,” Rio said, sitting up, “we don’t just reject it. We pretend to consider it. Stall. Keep them thinking we’re weak. Meanwhile, we hit them with everything we’ve got.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened. “That’s actually… a solid strategy.”</p><p>Jen nodded slowly. “If we act like we’re hesitant, they might get careless and reveal something bigger.”</p><p>Wanda leaned back, considering. “But it’s risky. If we wait too long, it could hurt us.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Then we make sure it doesn’t.”</p><p>Alice picked up the settlement paper again. “So, do we email them back? Say we’re thinking about it?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. Give them just enough hope that we’re breaking.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk was sharp. “And while they think they’re winning?”</p><p>Alice grinned. “We bury them.”</p><p>Wanda exhaled. “Alright. Let’s do it.”</p><p>Jen clapped her hands together. “War it is, then.”</p><p>The tension in Wanda’s house remained thick as Alice sat at the table, typing the email response to Evanora’s legal team. The rest of the group hovered nearby, watching over her shoulder.</p><p>“Alright,” Alice muttered. “We need to sound hesitant but not outright dismissive. Just enough to keep them on the hook.”</p><p>She read aloud as she typed:</p><p>To: Harkness Legal Affairs<br/>
From: Alice Wu-Gulliver<br/>
Subject: RE: Discussion of Possible Resolution</p><p>We appreciate the opportunity to discuss potential resolutions. Given the circumstances, our team requires time to review the terms you’ve provided and weigh our options accordingly.</p><p>This is a complex situation, and we hope to come to a solution that is mutually beneficial. We will be in touch shortly.</p><p>Alice looked up. “Thoughts?”</p><p>Rio leaned against the wall, arms crossed. “It’s neutral. Doesn’t commit to anything.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “That’s the point. Keeps them wondering what we’ll do next.”</p><p>Jen smirked. “And while they’re waiting, we work twice as hard to tear them down.”</p><p>Alice exhaled, then hit send. “Now we wait.”</p><p>But no one was planning to sit still.</p><p>Rio and Alice immediately went back to sifting through documents, trying to find any missing links that could further tie Evanora to illegal activity.</p><p>“Okay,” Alice murmured, flipping through her laptop screen. “We know she’s been funding conversion camps. We know she’s behind the threats. But we need something more concrete.”</p><p>Rio leaned over, scrolling through a list of financial transactions Alice had pulled. “This is weird. Look at these payments—small, regular deposits from untraceable accounts.”</p><p>Alice narrowed her eyes. “Could be shell companies. Laundering?”</p><p>“Could be,” Rio agreed. “Or it could be payoffs.”</p><p>Alice sat back, thinking. “You’re saying she’s paying someone to do her dirty work?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Wouldn’t be the first time.”</p><p>Alice immediately started cross-referencing names.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jen and Wanda were working on their own angle—contacting more victims.</p><p>Jen had managed to track down two more former conversion camp attendees, both of whom had left terrifying testimonials online about the abuse they suffered.</p><p>Wanda was the one making the calls. “Hi, this is Wanda Maximoff. I’m working with a team building a legal case against Evanora Harkness and her involvement in conversion camps. I was hoping to speak with you about—”</p><p>The call clicked off before she could finish.</p><p>Wanda sighed, rubbing her forehead. “That’s the third one who’s hung up.”</p><p>Jen winced. “They’re scared. Probably got threats of their own.”</p><p>Wanda frowned. “Then we need to make sure they know they’re not alone.”</p><p>Jen thought for a moment. “What if we get Tommy involved? He’s already been willing to talk to us, maybe he can reach out in a way we can’t.”</p><p>Wanda nodded slowly. “I’ll ask Billy to text him.”</p><p>Agatha, meanwhile, was going through surveillance reports that Lilia’s contacts had managed to obtain.</p><p>She flipped through grainy black-and-white images, one after the other. There was the man who attacked her, the same man who had been seen near Rio and Alice before their accident.</p><p>And there he was again.</p><p>Agatha’s brows furrowed. “You son of a bitch…”</p><p>She grabbed her phone and dialed Lilia. “We need to talk. I have a face, and I want a name.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice was sharp. “Send me what you’ve got. I’ll run it through my contacts.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. “On it.”</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Billy lay on his bed in his foster home, staring at the ceiling, his phone clutched in his hands. He had barely been back for 24 hours, and already he felt like he was suffocating.</p><p>The only thing keeping him sane was his conversation with Tommy.</p><p>Billy: Hey, I have a weird question. Do you remember any specific names of people who worked at the camp?</p><p>Tommy’s response took a few minutes, but when it came, it made Billy sit up straight.</p><p>Tommy: Yeah. I remember a guy named Carter. He was one of the worst. I can’t remember his last name, but he worked closely with the higher-ups.</p><p>Billy hesitated for a moment before replying.</p><p>Billy: That’s huge. I’m not with my people right now. I got sent back to my foster home, but I need you to forward all info to my sister Rio Vidal and my future adoptive mom, Wanda Maximoff. They’re leading this fight.</p><p>Tommy’s typing bubble appeared, then disappeared, then reappeared.</p><p>Tommy: Wait… you’re back in the system?</p><p>Billy sighed.</p><p>Billy: Yeah.</p><p>Tommy: Dude. That sucks.</p><p>Billy let out a humorless chuckle. “No shit.”</p><p>Billy: Just get the info to them. This could change everything.</p><p>Back at Wanda’s house, Rio’s phone buzzed.</p><p>She checked the message:</p><p>Tommy: Hey, Billy told me to send this to you. Carter Shaw worked at my camp. They called him Vertigo. Because he messed with your head. He knew how to make you feel sick, powerless. He was a master at psychological shit. Mind games. Fear tactics. And if that didn’t work? He’d make sure you stayed in line another way.</p><p>Rio’s heart dropped.</p><p>“Guys!” she burst into the living room, waving her phone. “Shaw’s nickname was Vertigo.”</p><p>The room went silent.</p><p>Agatha looked up sharply. “Vertigo?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Tommy just confirmed—he worked at the camp. He was one of the worst.”</p><p>Alice started typing furiously on her laptop. “If that’s true, then he’s not just an enforcer. He’s a professional manipulator.”</p><p>Jen’s jaw tightened. “Then we need to hit him where it hurts.”</p><p>Agatha  turned to Alice. “Check the financials again. Any large payments to a Carter?”</p><p>Alice typed rapidly. “Okay… Okay… Holy shit.”</p><p>Jen leaned in. “What?”</p><p>Alice turned the laptop around. “There’s a payment history. Someone named Carter Shaw has been receiving money from Evanora’s shell companies for years.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “Carter Shaw? That name sounds familiar—”</p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzed at that exact moment.</p><p>Lilia.</p><p>She answered immediately. “Tell me you have a name.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice was sharp. “Carter Shaw. He’s been working as an unofficial enforcer for wealthy families like Evanora’s. He’s done intimidation, sabotage, even violent enforcement.”</p><p>The room fell dead silent.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, exhaling slowly. “That’s our guy.”</p><p>Rio clenched her jaw. “He’s the one who attacked you. He’s the one who cut our brakes.”</p><p>Jen’s fists tightened. “And now we have proof.”</p><p>Agatha looked around the room. “This is bigger than we thought. If Shaw’s been working for Evanora for years, we’re looking at a full-on criminal enterprise.”</p><p>Alice nodded. “Which means if we go after him, we pull her whole network down with him.”</p><p>Wanda took a breath. “So what’s our next move?”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk was ice cold. “We give Evanora what she wants—we pretend we’re considering the deal.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes gleamed. “And while she’s waiting for an answer?”</p><p>Jen finished, “We take Carter Shaw down.”</p><p>Agatha stood, pacing as she thought. “We have a few angles we can take here.”</p><p>Alice nodded. “We could go public with this information, but if we don’t have concrete proof, Evanora’s lawyers will bury it.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward. “Or we turn him against her.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Jen smirked. “You’re saying we flip Vertigo?”</p><p>Agatha’s expression was sharp. “Think about it. If he’s her attack dog, she’s probably kept him on a short leash. If we find anything that makes him vulnerable, we can make him talk.”</p><p>Alice nodded, clicking through more files. “If we can find financial leverage, or even a personal connection she’s exploiting, he could be persuaded to turn on her.”</p><p>Jen hesitated. “But what if he’s loyal to her?”</p><p>Rio replied, her voice sharp. “Then we break that loyalty.”</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>For the next hour, the group worked at full speed.</p><p>Alice traced financial records, looking for off-the-books payments.</p><p>Jen searched for prior arrests, any leverage.</p><p>Wanda focused on reaching out to people who might have known him.</p><p>Agatha called Lilia, making sure they had legal backing if things got messy.</p><p>Rio? She sat in the corner, watching the pieces fall together.</p><p>And then Alice found it.</p><p>“He has a son.”</p><p>The room went still.</p><p>Alice pulled up a legal custody battle from years ago. “Carter Shaw has a kid. His ex-wife has full custody, but guess who’s been paying her legal fees for the past two years?”</p><p>Jen exhaled. “Don’t tell me—”</p><p>Alice’s smirk was grim. “Evanora Harkness.”</p><p>Rio’s entire demeanor shifted. “She’s holding his son over his head.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “And now we know how to break him.”</p><p>As the seconds passed, she tapped her fingers against the table. “Okay. We need to approach this carefully.”</p><p>Alice bit her lip. “Do we go straight to him? Or do we go through his ex?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “His ex might be safer. She has no reason to be loyal to Evanora. If we get her to talk, Shaw might crack under pressure.”</p><p>Wanda nodded. “And if he thinks she’s in danger?”</p><p>Jen smirked. “Then he’ll realize just how replaceable he is to Evanora.”</p><p>Agatha reached for her phone. “Then let’s pay her a visit.”</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>That evening, Agatha and Rio stood outside a small house on the edge of the city. The lights inside were dim, the neighborhood quiet.</p><p>Rio adjusted her jacket. “So, what’s the play? We just… knock?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “More or less.”</p><p>She stepped up and knocked. A few moments later, the door cracked open, revealing a tired-looking woman in her late thirties, her hair pulled into a loose ponytail.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. “Who are you?”</p><p>Agatha gave a calm, disarming smile. “We need to talk about Carter Shaw.”</p><p>The woman tensed immediately. “I don’t know who you are, but—”</p><p>Rio cut in smoothly. “He’s in danger. And so is your son.”</p><p>That made her pause.</p><p>Agatha took the opportunity. “We know Evanora is using you to control him. And we want to stop it.”</p><p>The woman’s lips pressed together. She looked ready to slam the door—until Rio added, “She’s going to get him killed.”</p><p>That did it.</p><p>The woman exhaled shakily. “Come inside.”</p><p>The trap was officially set.</p><p>The moment Rio and Agatha stepped into the dimly lit living room, the door clicked shut behind them.</p><p>Carter Shaw’s ex-wife—Lauren Shaw—stood with her arms crossed, her expression tight with years of exhaustion and guarded suspicion.</p><p>“I don’t know who you think you are,” she said, voice steady but laced with worn-out anger, “but I have nothing to say about Carter.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “That’s fine. We’re more interested in what Evanora Harkness is doing to you.”</p><p>Lauren froze.</p><p>Her jaw tightened, but her eyes flickered with something close to fear. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>Rio stepped forward, hands in her pockets. “Really? Because we do. We know Evanora’s been paying your legal fees, keeping you locked in an eternal custody battle while keeping Carter on her leash.”</p><p>Lauren’s hands clenched at her sides. “How do you know that?”</p><p>Alice’s words from earlier echoed in Rio’s mind. If we want to break Shaw, we have to break his trust in Evanora first.</p><p>So she did what she did best.</p><p>She pressed harder.</p><p>Rio took a step forward. “You know exactly how Evanora operates, don’t you? You take her money, she keeps you ‘safe’ from Carter. But that’s not the deal, is it?”</p><p>Lauren’s fingers curled into fists, but she didn’t respond.</p><p>Agatha, sensing an opening, pushed further. “She’s not protecting you. She’s using you to keep Carter under control. Because the second he steps out of line? She yanks the chain.”</p><p>Lauren swallowed hard. “That’s… not true.”</p><p>Rio let out a sharp laugh. “You’re telling me it’s a coincidence that every time Carter tries to leave Evanora’s payroll, you suddenly get hit with a new round of legal attacks? That your life only gets harder when he stops playing the perfect little attack dog?”</p><p>Lauren looked down, her breath shaky. “I—I don’t know—”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, her voice quieter, but sharper. “She’s not protecting you, Lauren. She’s making sure you never get away from him.”</p><p>Lauren’s shoulders shook as she exhaled.</p><p>And then, finally—her defenses cracked.</p><p>Lauren walked to the couch and sank onto it, rubbing her face.</p><p>“She promised…” Lauren whispered. “She promised she’d keep him away. That she’d make sure I never had to worry about Carter again.”</p><p>Rio sat down beside her. “And instead, she’s keeping you trapped. Just like she’s doing to him.”</p><p>Lauren looked up, eyes red-rimmed. “He wasn’t always like this, you know.”</p><p>Agatha stayed quiet, letting her continue.</p><p>Lauren swallowed, shaking her head. “Carter—he was a terrible husband, don’t get me wrong. But before Evanora, he was just another lost, angry man. She got her claws into him, and suddenly, he wasn’t just violent—he was controlled. And that’s the worst part. He’s not just a monster. He’s a weapon she built.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach twisted.</p><p>Agatha exhaled. “So how do we make him snap out of it?”</p><p>Lauren’s lips parted, but she hesitated.</p><p>She looked down at her hands, as if weighing a choice.</p><p>Then, softly, she said, “You have to make him believe she’s done with him first.”</p><p>Agatha leaned forward. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Lauren’s fingers tightened. “Carter knows he’s disposable. But as long as Evanora still pretends to need him, he won’t turn. He still thinks she’s his only way to survive.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes. “So we make him think she’s already thrown him away?”</p><p>Lauren nodded.</p><p>“If Carter thinks Evanora’s cut him loose, he’ll panic. And when Carter panics, he gets sloppy.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “And when he gets sloppy, he starts talking.”</p><p>Lauren sighed. “It’s risky. If you push him too hard, he’ll lash out.”</p><p>Rio leaned back. “Let him. If he lashes out, he’ll prove exactly who he is to anyone still protecting him.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio, a slow smirk forming. “I like the way you think.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “I’m full of bad ideas.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk widened. “Yeah, but this one? Might just work.”</p><p>Lauren hesitated, then got up and walked to a small drawer near the kitchen. She pulled out a stack of old papers and handed them to Agatha.</p><p>“These are Carter’s old contracts with Evanora. Some of them go back years. They won’t be enough to take her down alone, but they might help.”</p><p>Agatha took them carefully. “This is more than enough to start a fire.”</p><p>Lauren looked between them. “I can’t promise he’ll crack. But if anyone can break him, it’s Evanora.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Then let’s make her do just that.”</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>After their tense conversation inside the house, Lauren Shaw hesitated near the door as Rio stepped outside.</p><p>Agatha, who had been organizing the documents Lauren had given them, looked up as the woman shifted uncomfortably near the dining table.</p><p>“Something else on your mind?” Agatha asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Lauren sighed, glancing toward the door where Rio stood, her shoulders stiff, tension radiating from every movement.</p><p>She looked back at Agatha. “I—” She hesitated, then lowered her voice. “I saw her limping.”</p><p>Agatha’s spine straightened instantly.</p><p>Lauren exhaled. “What did Carter do to her?”</p><p>Agatha’s instinct was to lie, to brush it off, but there was something about Lauren’s tone—it wasn’t just curiosity. It was guilt.</p><p>And guilt meant allies.</p><p>So, Agatha told her the truth.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was steady, cold, as she began. “Carter has been following us for months. He’s the one who broke into Wanda’s house. The one who slashed Rio’s brakes before the crash.”</p><p>Lauren stiffened, her fingers curling into fists.</p><p>Agatha kept going, her voice sharpening. “He also put a knife in Rio’s side when she saved me from a mugging.”</p><p>Lauren’s eyes widened in horror. “Jesus…”</p><p>Agatha inhaled, forcing the images away. “We barely got her to the hospital in time. She almost died.”</p><p>Lauren sat down, looking genuinely sick. “I… I didn’t know.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Of course you didn’t. That’s what people like Evanora and Carter count on. Silence. Isolation. Fear.”</p><p>Lauren put her face in her hands. “I knew he was violent, but—this?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips pressed together. “Yeah. This.”</p><p>Lauren sat there, her shoulders shaking slightly, before finally looking up at Agatha.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Her voice was raw. “I know that probably doesn’t mean anything, but—I’m sorry for what he’s done to you. To Rio. To all of you.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a long moment before letting out a slow breath. “It’s not your fault.”</p><p>Lauren shook her head. “I married him. I let myself believe—” She cut herself off, swallowing hard. “I should have fought harder to stop him.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened slightly. “Fighting Carter Shaw isn’t easy. You of all people know that.”</p><p>Lauren let out a bitter laugh. “Yeah. I do.”</p><p>There was a pause, both women caught in a quiet understanding.</p><p>Then Lauren glanced toward the door again. “Rio… she’s strong.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched. “Stubborn as hell, too.”</p><p>Lauren smiled faintly, then turned back to Agatha, something more certain in her expression now. “She loves you.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Lauren continued, her voice warm despite the pain lingering in her eyes. “And you love her. That much is obvious.”</p><p>Agatha looked away, suddenly feeling too exposed. “I do but right now it's...complicated.”</p><p>Lauren chuckled softly. “Love usually is.”</p><p>She paused, then added, “But I’ve seen what a real, toxic relationship looks like. And that’s not what you and Rio have. Whatever happens next, you have each other. And that? That matters.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, trying not to let the weight of that truth hit too hard.</p><p>Instead, she just nodded. “Yeah. It does.”</p><p>Lauren offered a small, sad smile. “Then hold on to it.”</p><p>And for the first time in a while, Agatha truly planned to.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Outside, Rio scrolled through her phone, looking up, her eyes narrowing slightly as she saw Agatha and Lauren still talking.</p><p>For a brief second, Rio felt uneasy.</p><p>She wasn’t used to people who had been part of the problem wanting to fix things.</p><p>She wasn’t sure she trusted it yet.</p><p>But when Agatha finally walked out of the house, a small, knowing smile on her lips, something in Rio’s chest settled.</p><p>Agatha nudged her shoulder playfully. “You ready to mess with Carter Shaw’s head?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Hell yeah.”</p><p>And as they walked toward the car, preparing for the final stage of their plan, Agatha thought about what Lauren had said.</p><p>She loves you.</p><p>And Agatha knew—without a doubt—she loved Rio, too.</p><p>The drive back to Wanda’s house was quiet, both Rio and Agatha lost in thought.</p><p>Lauren’s words still echoed in Agatha’s mind.</p><p>She loves you. And you love her. That much is obvious.</p><p>Agatha gripped the steering wheel tighter, stealing a glance at Rio, who was staring out the window, her jaw tight, fingers fidgeting against her thigh.</p><p>She was thinking. Planning. Preparing for war.</p><p>Agatha sighed and turned her attention back to the road.</p><p>One problem at a time.</p><p>They had a trap to set, and Carter "Vertigo" Shaw was about to walk right into it.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>By the time Agatha and Rio returned to Wanda’s house, everyone was already gathered in the living room—Wanda, Alice, Jen, and Lilia, all waiting for their update.</p><p>Agatha barely had time to take off her coat before Wanda demanded, “Well?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Lauren gave us the leverage we needed.”</p><p>Alice leaned forward. “Which is?”</p><p>Agatha tossed the stack of old contracts onto the coffee table. “Proof of his long-term loyalty to Evanora. And guess what? She’s been keeping him close by keeping him afraid.”</p><p>Jen raised an eyebrow. “Afraid of what?”</p><p>Rio leaned against the wall. “Losing his son.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened. “Wait—you’re telling me Evanora has been using his kid as a way to keep him under control?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “She’s paying his ex-wife’s legal fees, ensuring that Shaw stays in line.”</p><p>Lilia exhaled, rubbing her temples. “Jesus Christ.”</p><p>Wanda crossed her arms. “So, what’s the plan?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “We make Carter think Evanora has already thrown him away.”</p><p>Jen’s interest piqued. “How?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “We leak fake information through channels we know will reach him.”</p><p>Alice pulled out her laptop. “I can arrange that.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Make it look like Evanora has been preparing a new enforcer—someone to replace him. Someone younger. Faster. More obedient.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression turned thoughtful. “That’ll make him paranoid.”</p><p>Lilia leaned forward, intrigued. “If he thinks she’s cutting him off, what’s the next step?”</p><p>Agatha exchanged a glance with Rio before answering.</p><p>“We push him into a corner.”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms. “If Shaw thinks Evanora has betrayed him, he’ll start looking for a way to save himself.”</p><p>Alice nodded. “And that’s when we offer him a deal.”</p><p>Jen smirked. “You think he’ll flip?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “He’ll have to. His entire life has been about protecting himself. If Evanora isn’t there to do it, he’ll start looking for someone who can.”</p><p>Wanda exhaled. “And if he doesn’t?”</p><p>Rio’s smirk was sharp as a knife. “Then we take him down another way.”</p><p>Alice got to work, crafting a digital trail of rumors suggesting that Evanora was already in the process of replacing Carter Shaw.</p><p>Emails were sent. Anonymous tips were dropped in places Carter was known to frequent.</p><p>And, most importantly—a carefully fabricated report was leaked, indicating that Evanora had already hired someone else.</p><p>Now, all they had to do was wait for the cracks to show.</p><p>It didn’t take long.</p><p>Less than twenty-four hours later, Lilia received a phone call from one of her contacts.</p><p>Lilia: “You have something for me?”</p><p>Contact: “Yeah. Shaw’s been asking questions. He’s paranoid. Talking to people, trying to figure out if the rumors are true.”</p><p>Lilia smirked. “Perfect.”</p><p>She hung up and turned to the group.</p><p>“It’s working.”</p><p>Now came the hardest part.</p><p>They needed to corner Carter—and they needed to do it in a way that made him come to them.</p><p>Agatha looked at Alice. “You ready for the next step?”</p><p>Alice cracked her knuckles. “Let’s make him sweat.”</p><p>Now, all they had to do was watch Carter Shaw unravel.</p><p>It started with small things. Reports from Lilia’s contacts said he was on edge, snapping at people, making erratic phone calls.</p><p>Then, he started showing up at places he normally avoided—high-profile corporate buildings, bars frequented by Evanora’s associates, even the law firm where her legal team worked.</p><p>He was searching for answers.</p><p>And he wasn’t getting them.</p><p>It didn’t take long before Shaw made his first mistake.</p><p>Alice, monitoring his digital footprint, smirked as she turned her laptop toward Agatha and Rio. “He’s trying to find dirt on Evanora.”</p><p>Agatha leaned over. “He’s looking for leverage.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Dude’s been loyal to her for years, and now he’s finally realizing he’s disposable.”</p><p>Jen smirked. “Bet that stings.”</p><p>Wanda tapped her fingers against the table. “So when does he reach out?”</p><p>Alice refreshed the feed. “Any minute now.”</p><p>And she was right.</p><p>Less than two hours later, Carter Shaw called Lauren.</p><p>Lauren’s phone buzzed, and she stared at the screen, hesitation flickering across her face.</p><p>Then, she answered.</p><p>“Carter.”</p><p>His voice came through tense and raw. “Lauren. You need to tell me the truth.”</p><p>She glanced at Agatha, who nodded silently, urging her to keep going.</p><p>“About what?” she asked smoothly.</p><p>“I heard something,” Carter said, his breathing uneven. “That Evanora is cutting me off. That she’s bringing in someone new.”</p><p>Lauren swallowed hard. “And what if she is?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then, Carter let out a harsh laugh. “You’re lying.”</p><p>Lauren’s expression hardened. “Am I? When was the last time she called you? When was the last time she needed you for something important?”</p><p>Carter didn’t answer.</p><p>Lauren twisted the knife. “You know how she works. Once you’re not useful, she moves on.”</p><p>Another silence. Longer this time.</p><p>Then Carter’s voice came through, lower, rougher.</p><p>“…I need to see you.”</p><p>Lauren locked eyes with Agatha.</p><p>They had him.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Carter agreed to meet Lauren in a public café. Somewhere neutral. Somewhere safe.</p><p>What he didn’t know was that Agatha and Rio would be watching from a distance.</p><p>As they waited for the meeting time, Rio leaned against the hood of the car, her fingers twitching.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her. “You okay?”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Fine. Just can’t wait to see this bastard squirm.”</p><p>Agatha reached out, squeezing her hand. “We’ve got this.”</p><p>Rio exhaled. “Yeah. I know.”</p><p>They watched as Lauren arrived first, taking a seat near the window. She looked calm, but Agatha knew she was on edge.</p><p>Then, Carter walked in.</p><p>And just like that, the final act of their trap began.</p><p>Lauren sipped her coffee as Carter sat down across from her, his expression dark, full of suspicion.</p><p>“You’re being paranoid,” Lauren said, tilting her head. “Why would Evanora replace you?”</p><p>Carter stared at her, his fingers clenching around his cup. “I don’t know. But something’s off.”</p><p>Lauren sighed. “Then maybe you should ask her.”</p><p>Carter’s jaw tightened. “I tried.”</p><p>Lauren raised an eyebrow. “And?”</p><p>“She hasn’t returned my calls,” he admitted. “Not once.”</p><p>Lauren leaned forward, her voice quieter. “You know what that means.”</p><p>Carter’s hands shook slightly, but he forced his expression to remain unreadable.</p><p>Lauren took another sip of coffee, letting the silence linger before she delivered the final blow.</p><p>“She never needed you, Carter. You were just a tool. And now? You’re broken.”</p><p>Carter’s entire body tensed.</p><p>His breathing was shallow. His hands were tight fists. His eyes were wide, unfocused.</p><p>Agatha, watching from the car, murmured, “This is it.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, her grip on the steering wheel tightening. “He’s about to snap.”</p><p>And they were right.</p><p>Because Carter Shaw—Evanora’s most loyal enforcer—was about to betray her.</p><p>Carter Shaw sat across from Lauren, his fingers clenching and unclenching around his coffee cup.</p><p>His face was unreadable, but his body betrayed him—tense shoulders, darting eyes, shallow breathing.</p><p>He was crumbling.</p><p>Lauren, keeping her expression calm, took another sip of her coffee. “Carter, you need to think. If Evanora had your back, she would have answered your calls.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Carter exhaled sharply, looking away. “She’s probably just busy.”</p><p>Lauren tilted her head. “She’s replacing you.”</p><p>Carter’s jaw tightened. “No. She wouldn’t—”</p><p>Lauren cut him off, her voice cold. “She already has.”</p><p>That hit him. Hard.</p><p>His knuckles turned white. “If that’s true…” His voice was dangerously low. “Then I’m screwed.”</p><p>Lauren leaned forward, whispering the words that would change everything.</p><p>“Not if you flip first.”</p><p>Carter’s eyes snapped up to hers. “Flip?”</p><p>Lauren nodded. “Give them something on her. Something big. Something that will make the court cut you a deal.”</p><p>Carter scoffed, but it wasn’t as confident as before. “And what happens when she finds out?”</p><p>Lauren’s voice didn’t waver. “She already cut you loose. Do you really think she’ll save you now?”</p><p>Carter’s fingers tapped against the table, a nervous tic. His mind was racing, calculating, processing.</p><p>Agatha and Rio, watching from the car, saw it happen.</p><p>The exact moment Carter Shaw realized he was alone.</p><p>Carter exhaled, dragging a hand over his face. “Let’s say I do this. Let’s say I talk. What do I get?”</p><p>Lauren stayed calm. “You get your life back. You get your son back. And you don’t go down with her.”</p><p>Carter’s breath hitched.</p><p>His son.</p><p>The only thing Evanora still had over him.</p><p>He swallowed, his fingers trembling slightly. “And if I don’t?”</p><p>Lauren met his gaze. “Then you take the fall. All of it.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then, Carter laughed softly, shaking his head. “Jesus. You’re ruthless.”</p><p>Lauren smirked, leaning back in her chair. “I learned from the best.”</p><p>Carter sat there, his mind running in circles.</p><p>Every instinct told him to stay loyal, to keep his mouth shut.</p><p>But then he thought about his son.</p><p>About the calls Evanora ignored.</p><p>About how easily she discarded him.</p><p>He let out a long breath. “Alright.”</p><p>Lauren raised an eyebrow. “Alright?”</p><p>Carter nodded, resigned. “I’ll talk.”</p><p>Lauren didn’t let herself celebrate yet. “You swear?”</p><p>Carter sighed. “Yeah.” He looked at her, eyes dark. “But I want something in return.”</p><p>Lauren hesitated. “What?”</p><p>Carter leaned forward. “Protection.”</p><p>Lauren nodded slowly. “I’ll make the call.”</p><p>Agatha, watching from the car, turned to Rio with a smirk.</p><p>“We got him.”</p><p>Rio let out a low whistle, shaking her head. “Damn.”</p><p>They had officially flipped Evanora’s most loyal attack dog.</p><p>And now?</p><p>She was going down.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Carter sat across from Lilia Calderu, Agatha, and Rio in a dimly lit private meeting room that Lilia had arranged.</p><p>His body was rigid, his hands clasped together on the table, but his eyes darted between them—calculating, suspicious.</p><p>Lilia leaned forward, folding her hands together. “Let’s be clear about something, Mr. Shaw. We can’t offer you immunity.”</p><p>Carter scoffed, shaking his head. “Figures.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “What we can do, however, is offer favorable terms.”</p><p>Carter’s eyes flickered toward her.</p><p>Lilia continued, calm but firm. “We can argue for a reduced sentence, possibly home detention instead of prison. Depending on what you give us, we can push for probationary terms.”</p><p>Carter leaned back, crossing his arms. “And why should I believe you?”</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, resisting the urge to roll her eyes. “Because if Evanora goes down, you go down with her unless you give us something to work with.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then Carter exhaled, rubbing his face. “Fine. What do you want to know?”</p><p>Lilia’s voice was cool and sharp. “Everything.”</p><p>Carter let out a low, bitter chuckle. “You’re going to need more time.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “We have time. What we don’t have is patience.”</p><p>Carter shook his head, running a hand through his hair. “You don’t get it. Evanora doesn’t just run some corporate empire—she has her hands in everything. You name it—politicians, law enforcement, private security firms, offshore accounts, international contracts.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened. “Tell us about the conversion camps.”</p><p>Carter sighed, looking momentarily uncomfortable. “Evanora doesn’t run them herself. She just funds them.”</p><p>Alice, listening remotely from a secure line, muttered, “Of course she does.”</p><p>Carter continued, “She uses shell companies to funnel money to ‘nonprofits’ that operate these places. It keeps her name clean. If one camp gets shut down, she moves her money to another.”</p><p>Lilia took notes, her expression unreadable. “And the staff?”</p><p>Carter exhaled. “She hires guys like me. People who know how to control people.”</p><p>Rio’s hands clenched into fists. “And when ‘control’ doesn’t work?”</p><p>Carter’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t answer.</p><p>He didn’t need to.</p><p>Silence settled over the room.</p><p>Agatha pushed forward. “What about the attacks?”</p><p>Carter finally looked at her. “What, you mean the knife? The brakes?”</p><p>Rio’s fingers twitched, but Agatha stayed eerily calm.</p><p>“Yes,” she said smoothly.</p><p>Carter sighed. “That wasn’t just about you two. Evanora was testing my loyalty.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach curled. “Testing?”</p><p>Carter nodded. “She wanted to see how far I was willing to go.” He laughed bitterly. “Guess I failed, huh?”</p><p>Rio’s voice was low and dangerous. “Yeah. Guess you did.”</p><p>Carter looked away, shaking his head. “She’s always been like this. When people stop being useful, she gets rid of them.”</p><p>Lilia leaned in. “So why are you still alive?”</p><p>Carter let out a humorless laugh. “Because I still had one thing she could use against me.”</p><p>His son.</p><p>Agatha exchanged a glance with Rio.</p><p>Lauren had been right.</p><p>Evanora had kept Carter under control by making sure he never got close enough to break away.</p><p>And now?</p><p>That leverage was gone.</p><p>Lilia’s voice cut through the tension. “Do you have documents linking her to these activities?”</p><p>Carter snorted. “You really think I’d still be alive if I kept shit like that?”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms. “No. But you know where to find them.”</p><p>Carter hesitated.</p><p>Lilia narrowed her eyes. “Carter, you’re already talking. You might as well finish the job.”</p><p>Carter exhaled. “Her office. Her private vault. She keeps everything—contracts, transactions, blackmail material.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse quickened.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>This was the final piece.</p><p>Rio leaned forward, her voice quiet but deadly. “You get us inside, and we’ll make sure you don’t spend the rest of your life in a cell.”</p><p>Carter studied her, then smirked.</p><p>“You’re scary when you’re serious.”</p><p>Rio didn’t blink. “I’m always serious.”</p><p>Carter let out a breath. “Fine. I’ll help you get in.”</p><p>Lilia closed her notebook and stood. “Then we have a deal.”</p><p>As they left the meeting, Rio finally let out the breath she’d been holding.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her. “You okay?”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “I just spent an hour in a room with the guy who stabbed me. How do you think I’m doing?”</p><p>Agatha nudged her gently. “You held your ground.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “I always do.”</p><p>Agatha smirked back. “Yeah, I know.”</p><p>They got into the car, the weight of what just happened settling in.</p><p>Carter Shaw had flipped.</p><p>And now?</p><p>It was time to take Evanora Harkness down.</p><p>The moment Carter agreed to help them, the tension in the room shifted. The deal was set. The information was theirs.</p><p>But for Agatha Harkness, something still wasn’t settled.</p><p>She stood up, stretching her fingers before speaking. “I want a minute alone with him.”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped toward her. “Agatha—”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “Just a minute.”</p><p>Lilia crossed her arms, considering. She exchanged a brief, knowing glance with Rio before nodding.</p><p>“Fine,” Lilia said. “One minute.”</p><p>Rio hesitated but eventually exhaled, shooting Carter a warning glare before standing. “Try anything, and I’ll finish what I started in that alley.”</p><p>Carter only smirked.</p><p>Lilia and Rio exited the room.</p><p>The door clicked shut.</p><p>Now, it was just Agatha and Vertigo.</p><p>Agatha slowly walked back to the table, sitting across from Carter, her expression unreadable.</p><p>Carter leaned back in his chair, watching her with amusement. “So. What’s this about? A heart-to-heart?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond.</p><p>Instead, she punched him.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>Carter grunted, his head snapping to the side. The force of it split his lip, and blood dribbled down his chin.</p><p>He didn’t react with anger.</p><p>Instead, he wiped the blood with the back of his hand and smirked.</p><p>“Well. That’s one way to start a conversation.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was cold as ice. “That one was for my family.”</p><p>Carter sighed theatrically, rolling his jaw. “Fair enough.”</p><p>The second punch was harder than the first.</p><p>Carter’s chair scraped against the floor as his head snapped sideways, more blood dripping from his lip. He grunted, rolling his jaw as if assessing the damage.</p><p>Agatha’s chest heaved, her fists still clenched, her breath ragged with something deeper than anger.</p><p>She didn’t move.</p><p>Didn’t speak.</p><p>Because suddenly, everything was catching up to her.</p><p>Everything Carter had done.</p><p>Everything he took from them.</p><p>Her vision blurred, but not from rage. From exhaustion. From relief. From everything she had almost lost.</p><p>Her throat closed up, but she forced the words out, low and shaking.</p><p>“That one was for Rio.”</p><p>Her voice broke around the name.</p><p>And for the first time since this war began, Agatha Harkness almost fell apart.</p><p>Carter was still silent, watching her through half-lidded eyes, but Agatha barely saw him.</p><p>Because all she could see was Rio.</p><p>Rio, bleeding out in her arms after the stabbing.<br/>
Rio, unconscious in a hospital bed after the crash.<br/>
Rio, crying in the shower, breaking apart, refusing help.<br/>
Rio, exhausted, hurt, yet still standing by her side, ready to fight.</p><p>Agatha’s hands trembled at her sides.</p><p>She swallowed against the lump in her throat, but it was useless.</p><p>Tears burned at the edges of her vision, threatening to spill—not from weakness, but from how much she had been holding inside.</p><p>She had almost lost her.</p><p>Twice.</p><p>And it was because of this man.</p><p>The bastard sitting in front of her, looking too damn relaxed for someone who had put the person she loved more than anything through hell.</p><p>Agatha let out a sharp exhale, blinking rapidly. She wouldn’t let him see her break.</p><p>But God, she was so close.</p><p>Carter slowly wiped the blood from his lip, still silent, still watching.</p><p>Then, to her shock, he simply nodded.</p><p>“Well deserved,” he muttered, voice rough but accepting.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>No fight.</p><p>No retaliation.</p><p>Just acceptance.</p><p>As if he knew.</p><p>As if he had known all along that he had deserved every ounce of her hatred.</p><p>And that realization made Agatha’s hands unclench.</p><p>Because for the first time, Carter Shaw wasn’t the all-powerful enforcer anymore.</p><p>He was just a man. A weak, broken man who had made the wrong choices.</p><p>A man who had already lost everything.</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders sagged. The storm inside her was still raging, but it was quieter now.</p><p>The tears didn’t fall. Not completely. But her breathing slowed.</p><p>The weight on her chest?</p><p>A little lighter.</p><p>She took a step back, swallowing down the last remnants of her fury.</p><p>And then, finally, she let go.</p><p>Carter cracked his neck, then gave her an amused look. “Damn. You throw a mean right hook, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes.</p><p>He smirked. “Maybe you’re in the wrong profession. Ever considered a career in enforcement?”</p><p>Agatha let out a humorless laugh. “Yeah, well, I don’t particularly enjoy ruining lives for a paycheck.”</p><p>Carter wiped the last of the blood from his mouth. “Fair enough.”</p><p>Agatha took a step closer, leaning in slightly. “You’re lucky I stopped at two.”</p><p>Carter smirked again, but this time, there was something almost genuine behind it. “Yeah. Lucky me.”</p><p>The door opened, and Rio stepped back in, her gaze immediately landing on Carter’s bloodied lip.</p><p>She looked at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p>Rio snorted, shaking her head before turning to Carter. “Guess we’re not the only ones who want your blood, huh?”</p><p>Carter grinned. “Apparently, I’m very punchable.”</p><p>Lilia sighed, stepping in behind them. “Alright, are we done here? Or do we need a round three?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, rolling her shoulders. “I’m good.”</p><p>She turned toward the door, her anger finally spent.</p><p>As she walked out, Carter’s voice followed her.</p><p>“Hey, Harkness.”</p><p>She paused, glancing back.</p><p>Carter smirked, lip still bleeding. “You ever want lessons? I’d be happy to teach you how to really throw a punch.”</p><p>Agatha just gave him a deadpan stare.</p><p>Then, without a word, she walked out and shut the door behind her.</p>

<p>The house was silent, save for the occasional rustling of papers and the soft hum of Alice’s laptop.</p><p>Everyone was gathered around the dining table, their faces illuminated by the glow of multiple screens. Blueprints, security logs, and building schematics were scattered across the table, creating a map of their mission.</p><p>Agatha tapped a section of the Harkness Corporation floor plan. “The vault is here. Evanora’s private office, top floor, back wall.”</p><p>Alice nodded, zooming in on the security system logs. “There’s a biometric lock. She’s the only one with clearance.”</p><p>Jen frowned. “So how do we get in?”</p><p>Rio, leaning against the wall, smirked. “We cheat.”</p><p>Everyone turned toward her.</p><p>She gestured toward Carter Shaw, who was seated in the corner, watching the group with mild amusement. His lip was still split, and the bruises from Agatha’s punches were starting to darken.</p><p>Carter stretched his arms. “I still have access codes. And I know the patrol shifts.”</p><p>Lilia folded her arms. “And you’re just giving them to us out of the kindness of your heart?”</p><p>Carter smirked. “Please. I just want to see that bitch burn.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression darkened, but Rio placed a hand on her arm, grounding her.</p><p>Alice exhaled. “Alright. Let’s break this down.”</p><p>Alice pointed at the screen. “Security changes every two hours, and we need to time this right. We have a one-hour window where the guards swap out. That’s when we go in.”</p><p>Wanda leaned forward. “So, who’s going?”</p><p>Agatha straightened. “Me, Rio, Alice, and Carter.”</p><p>Jen raised an eyebrow. “Why Carter?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was calm but firm. “Because he knows that building better than anyone. And if he tries anything, I get to break his nose.”</p><p>Carter held up his hands. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”</p><p>Wanda sighed. “And the rest of us?”</p><p>Alice scrolled through her notes. “We need a lookout team. Jen, and Wanda will monitor the security feeds remotely and give us a warning if anything changes.”</p><p>Jen nodded. “I can work with that.”</p><p>Wanda exhaled. “Fine. But you get in and get out. No heroics.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Define heroics.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a warning look. “Rio.”</p><p>Rio smirked but didn’t argue.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Two nights later.</p><p>The air was cold, the city quiet except for the distant hum of traffic.</p><p>The team stood outside the Harkness Corporation building, dressed in dark clothes, their movements silent as they made their way toward the service entrance.</p><p>Alice pulled out a device, hacking into the security panel. The lock beeped twice before the light flashed green.</p><p>“We’re in,” Alice whispered.</p><p>Agatha and Rio slipped inside first, Carter following close behind.</p><p>The air inside was sterile, cold, just like Agatha remembered from her childhood.</p><p>Everything about this place felt like Evanora.</p><p>Alice whispered through their earpieces. “Okay. Hallway’s clear. You need to take the back stairwell to the top floor.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, leading the way.</p><p>They reached the stairwell, moving quickly and quietly. But as they hit the third floor, Carter suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Rio’s hand immediately went to her knife. “What?”</p><p>Carter frowned, glancing toward a security panel on the wall. “They changed the system.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Carter exhaled. “They added motion sensors to the stairwell doors.”</p><p>Alice’s voice crackled through their earpieces. “That wasn’t in the last security update.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “Of course they changed something.”</p><p>Agatha looked at Alice. “Can you disable it?”</p><p>Alice hesitated. “Not remotely. It has to be done manually from the security hub… which is two floors below you.”</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth. “We don’t have time to—”</p><p>Carter suddenly smirked. “I can do it.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “And we’re just supposed to trust you?”</p><p>Carter shrugged. “If I wanted to sell you out, I would’ve done it already.”</p><p>Agatha considered it. They didn’t have time to debate.</p><p>“Fine,” she said. “You have ten minutes.”</p><p>Carter gave a mock salute. “See you soon.”</p><p>And then he disappeared down the stairs.</p><p>Agatha and Rio crouched behind a column, waiting for Carter to disable the sensors.</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly. “This is a bad idea.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Probably.”</p><p>Rio turned toward her. “You doing okay?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated. “Honestly? No.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “That honest answer is new.”</p><p>Agatha let out a small laugh. “Yeah, well… almost losing you twice changed some things.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened. “I’m not going anywhere, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her chest tightening. “You better not.”</p><p>Before Rio could respond, Alice’s voice buzzed in their earpieces.</p><p>“Sensors are down. You’re clear.”</p><p>Agatha and Rio exchanged a glance.</p><p>“Showtime,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>The office was dark, but Agatha knew exactly where to go.</p><p>She strode toward the far wall, running her fingers along the wood paneling until she found it—the hidden keypad.</p><p>She punched in the override code that Carter had given them.</p><p>The vault clicked open.</p><p>Alice whispered, “You’ve got five minutes before security does a manual sweep.”</p><p>Agatha and Rio stepped inside.</p><p>And the first thing they saw?</p><p>Evanora Harkness’s secrets.</p><p>The door clicked open, revealing Evanora Harkness’s most guarded secrets.</p><p>The air inside was cold, the scent of old paper and steel filling the dimly lit space. The walls were lined with rows of locked filing cabinets, while a large safe stood at the back.</p><p>Agatha and Rio exchanged a tense glance.</p><p>“We have five minutes, tops,” Alice’s voice reminded them through their earpieces.</p><p>“Then let’s make them count,” Agatha muttered, stepping inside first.</p><p>Rio headed straight for the filing cabinets, yanking drawers open at random.</p><p>“What exactly are we looking for?” she asked, flipping through stacks of legal documents.</p><p>Agatha scanned the room. “Anything that directly ties her to fraud, bribery, money laundering. We need something that makes it impossible for her to walk free.”</p><p>Rio pulled out a file labeled “Phase One – Restricted” and froze.</p><p>She flipped it open, her stomach twisting.</p><p>Inside were dossiers—not on corporate figures, but on people.</p><p>More specifically?</p><p>Children.</p><p>Rio’s blood ran cold. “Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha turned, stepping closer. “What?”</p><p>Rio held up the first document, her hands trembling.</p><p>It was a detailed report on the children who had been sent to the conversion camps Evanora funded.</p><p>Dates. Names. Psychological evaluations.</p><p>And most importantly?</p><p>Signatures.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes darkened as she scanned the page.</p><p>Evanora Harkness’s own signature was on several documents, approving funding, security measures, and medical ‘treatments.’</p><p>“Jesus Christ,” Agatha whispered, her voice shaking.</p><p>Rio flipped to the next file.</p><p>More names. More victims.</p><p>And then, at the bottom of one page, Rio’s heart nearly stopped.</p><p>William Kaplan.</p><p>Her breath hitched.</p><p>Billy’s name was listed under a program labeled “Behavioral Correction – Category C.”</p><p>Rio’s vision blurred with rage.</p><p>Agatha placed a steadying hand on her back. “We have it. This is what we need.”</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, nodding. “Yeah. Yeah, we do.”</p><p>Agatha turned toward the large safe at the back of the room.</p><p>“This thing isn’t just for show,” she muttered, running a hand along the surface. “Evanora wouldn’t keep the real dirt anywhere easy to find.”</p><p>Rio wiped a hand over her face, pulling herself together. “Can you crack it?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Please. You forget who raised me.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “Right. Master criminal.”</p><p>Agatha knelt in front of the safe, fingers working quickly as she adjusted the dial.</p><p>Alice’s voice came through their earpieces. “Guys, two minutes.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “No pressure.”</p><p>The numbers clicked into place.</p><p>Then—</p><p>A soft beep.</p><p>The door swung open.</p><p>Inside, there were stacks of hard drives, USBs, and more files.</p><p>Agatha grabbed everything she could, stuffing it into a secured bag.</p><p>Rio flipped through another thin stack of documents, her breath catching when she saw one in particular.</p><p>A contract.</p><p>Signed between Evanora Harkness and a private security firm.</p><p>One that outlined covert operations, political blackmail, and more.</p><p>The same firm Carter Shaw had worked for.</p><p>Rio smirked. “She paid to make people disappear.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed the document. “Not anymore.”</p><p>Alice’s voice crackled again. “Sixty seconds!”</p><p>Agatha nodded, zipping the bag shut. “We’re done here.”</p><p>Rio took one last look at the room—the temple of corruption Evanora had built.</p><p>Then she turned and walked out without another word.</p><p>As they reached the stairwell, Carter’s voice buzzed in their ears.</p><p>“Security’s doing an unscheduled sweep—get out NOW.”</p><p>Rio cursed. “Shit.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed her wrist. “Stairs or elevator?”</p><p>Alice answered before they could decide. “Neither. They’ll see you.”</p><p>“Then what?”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Then, Alice sighed. “You’re not gonna like this.”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “You’re about to say something stupid, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Take the window.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “The WHAT?”</p><p>Alice was already typing. “West side of the building. Service ledge. You can shimmy down to the emergency exit.”</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio. “You up for some Spider-Man bullshit?”</p><p>Rio sighed. “If we die, I’m haunting you first.”</p><p>“Fair.”</p><p>They ran toward the window.</p><p>Agatha kicked the window open, glancing down.</p><p>The ledge was narrow, but it was possible.</p><p>Alice’s voice came through. “You’ve got thirty seconds before guards hit your floor.”</p><p>Agatha climbed out first, gripping the window frame tightly.</p><p>She turned back to Rio, holding out a hand. “Come on.”</p><p>Rio hesitated for half a second.</p><p>Then she took a deep breath and grabbed Agatha’s hand.</p><p>Together, they moved along the ledge, inching toward the emergency exit.</p><p>Agatha could hear footsteps inside the building.</p><p>They were running out of time.</p><p>As they reached the exit, Rio grabbed the handle, yanking it open.</p><p>The moment they slipped inside, Alice’s voice came back.</p><p>“Security just reached your floor.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Too late.”</p><p>They raced down the emergency stairs, bursting through the back exit into the alley where Wanda and Jen were waiting in a car.</p><p>Wanda threw the door open. “Get in!”</p><p>Rio and Agatha jumped inside, the tires screeching as Wanda floored it.</p><p>As the building disappeared behind them, Agatha finally exhaled.</p><p>They had it.</p><p>Everything they needed to destroy Evanora Harkness.</p><p>Rio leaned her head back, catching her breath.</p><p>Agatha turned to her, smirking. “Told you we’d make it.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “I hate you.”</p><p>Wanda snorted. “You love her.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then, Rio mumbled.</p><p>“...Yeah, I do.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped.</p><p>But before she could say anything—</p><p>Alice’s voice cut through the radio.</p><p>“Guys. We have a problem.”<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~</p><p>The car sped through the city streets, Wanda gripping the wheel tightly, while Rio and Agatha caught their breath in the backseat.</p><p>Then Alice’s voice crackled through the radio channel, urgency in her tone.</p><p>“Guys. We have a problem.”</p><p>Agatha immediately sat up. “What kind of problem?”</p><p>In the safehouse, Alice was at her laptop, typing rapidly, her face pale under the screen’s glow.</p><p>She had just finished decrypting one of the hard drives they stole from Evanora’s vault.</p><p>And what she saw made her blood run cold.</p><p> “I pulled up the financials first. The ones tracking her shell companies, her funding sources… and, uh, there’s something really bad here.” Alice began.</p><p>Rio rubbed her temples. “Worse than conversion camps?”</p><p>Alice hesitated. “...Yes.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then Agatha’s voice darkened. “Tell us.”</p><p>Alice swallowed. “Evanora isn’t just laundering money into the camps. She’s been funneling millions into… something else.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach tightened. “What else?”</p><p>Alice’s fingers hovered over her keyboard as she clicked a file labeled ‘Project Chimera.’</p><p>Alice’s voice was low and unsettled.</p><p>“She’s funding mercenaries.”</p><p>Jen, who was still at the safehouse with Alice, leaned forward. “Like… military contractors?”</p><p>Alice shook her head. “No. Worse. These guys don’t answer to anyone. No official contracts, no government oversight. They’re ghosts. If she’s hiring them, it’s for something serious.”</p><p>Wanda, listening from the driver’s seat, cursed under her breath. “Please tell me there’s a paper trail.”</p><p>Alice clicked through more files. “Yes. And no. There are payout logs, encrypted messages, transfers to private accounts—but no actual details about what they were hired for.”</p><p>Agatha processed the information quickly.</p><p>Evanora was many things—power-hungry, ruthless, a control freak.</p><p>But she wasn’t reckless.</p><p>If she was funding private mercenaries, then she was preparing for something big.</p><p>And that terrified her.</p><p>Alice pulled up another hidden file, her heartbeat pounding in her ears.</p><p>“Wait,” she whispered. “There’s a video file.”</p><p>Jen leaned in. “Play it.”</p><p>Alice hesitated. “It’s encrypted—I need a second.”</p><p>Her fingers flew across the keyboard. The decryption process was slow, each passing second stretching longer and longer.</p><p>And then—</p><p>The screen flickered to life.</p><p>A grainy, black-and-white surveillance video.</p><p>The timestamp showed three weeks ago.</p><p>The location? Unknown.</p><p>But the faces?</p><p>Alice’s blood ran cold.</p><p>Because there, sitting in a conference room, was Evanora Harkness.</p><p>Across from her?</p><p>Carter Shaw.</p><p>And standing beside them?</p><p>A man in tactical gear, his face mostly hidden, but his presence undeniably familiar.</p><p>Alice immediately took a screenshot and zoomed in.</p><p>Agatha clenched her fists. “How much do they know?”</p><p>Alice scrolled rapidly through the files. “I don’t know yet. But there’s an active alert in the system—like a contingency plan.** If this vault was ever breached, certain protocols would trigger.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped. “What kind of protocols?”</p><p>Alice’s voice was grim.</p><p>“Kill orders.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Wanda gripped the wheel harder. “Whose names are on that list?”</p><p>Alice’s fingers trembled as she pulled up the target list.</p><p>The screen loaded.</p><p>Then she read the names out loud.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness.<br/>Rio Vidal.<br/>Wanda Maximoff.<br/>Alice Wu-Gulliver.<br/>Jennifer Kale.<br/>William Kaplan.”</p><p>Jen’s heart stopped. “Billy?!”</p><p>Alice nodded. “Evanora just put all of us on a hit list.”</p><p>Rio let out a slow breath, running a hand down her face. “So. That’s bad.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “That’s worse than bad. That means she’s known about us for longer than we thought.”</p><p>Wanda’s voice was calm but deadly. “Then we don’t wait anymore.”</p><p>Alice’s voice hardened. “We take her down. Now.”</p><p>The car pulled up outside the safehouse. Agatha, Rio, and Wanda jumped out, moving fast.</p><p>Alice spun her laptop around, showing them the video, the contracts, the kill orders.</p><p>It was all right there.</p><p>Everything they needed to bury Evanora forever.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, her voice low and firm. “This trial is going to be more than just legal charges.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “This is war.”</p><p>Wanda cracked her knuckles. “Then let’s make sure we win.”</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>The air inside the safehouse was thick with tension, the weight of the kill orders settling into the group like a suffocating fog.</p><p>Agatha stood at the head of the table, her hands pressed flat against the wood, her knuckles white.</p><p>“We’re not waiting for the trial,” she said, her voice dangerously calm.</p><p>Wanda crossed her arms. “Agreed.”</p><p>Rio cracked her knuckles, leaning against the counter. “Good. Because I’m done playing defense.”</p><p>Alice tapped away at her laptop, eyes scanning the files they stole from the vault. “Then let’s figure out our next move.”</p><p>They had everything they needed—financial records, illegal contracts, blackmail files.</p><p>Now?</p><p>They had to use it.</p><p>Alice exhaled, pulling up Evanora’s financial transactions. “Step one—we cut her off.”</p><p>Jen nodded. “She can’t buy her way out if she’s got no money.”</p><p>Alice smirked. “Luckily, I have very creative ways of making that happen.”</p><p>Her fingers flew across the keyboard, her hacking skills finally being put to use.</p><p>Within minutes, she started freezing assets, flagging transactions, rerouting funds into monitored accounts.</p><p>Wanda watched the screens with mild fascination. “You’re scary when you do that.”</p><p>Alice winked. “I know.”</p><p>By the time she was done, Evanora’s entire financial empire was in shambles.</p><p>Alice leaned back. “She’s gonna feel that one.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Good.”</p><p>Jen pulled up her phone. “Step two—we leak the information.”</p><p>They had more than enough evidence to bury Evanora in legal hell.</p><p>Now, they had to make sure the world saw it.</p><p>Rio crafted an anonymous data drop, sending it to Investigative journalists, The district attorney’s office, Political watchdog groups and Social media platforms</p><p>By the time she was done, Evanora Harkness’s sins were public knowledge.</p><p>Agatha leaned back. “That should keep her busy.”</p><p>Rio stretched. “Alright. So we’ve ruined her money. Exposed her secrets. What’s next?”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes darkened. “We make sure she can’t run.”</p><p>Lilia, who had been listening quietly, finally spoke. “Evanora’s not the type to accept defeat. If she thinks she’s lost, she’ll disappear.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled. “Then we box her in.”</p><p>They knew her habits. Her emergency contacts.</p><p>She had private airfields, hidden assets, people still willing to protect her.</p><p>They had to shut them all down.</p><p>Alice pulled up her last known locations, analyzing patterns. “She’s still at her penthouse. But if she moves, we’ll know.”</p><p>Agatha turned to Lilia. “Can you make some calls?”</p><p>Lilia smirked. “Already on it.”</p><p>Within minutes, she had secured surveillance on every possible escape route.</p><p>If Evanora tried to flee?</p><p>She’d be caught instantly.</p><p>Alice’s phone pinged.</p><p>Her eyes widened as she read the incoming alert.</p><p>“…She knows.”</p><p>Everyone turned toward her.</p><p>Alice swallowed. “Evanora just sent out a coded message to her remaining contacts.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Translation: she’s panicking.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Good. Let’s push her further.”</p><p>She grabbed her phone and started typing.</p><p>TO: Evanora Harkness<br/>FROM: Agatha Harkness</p><p>I told you to stay away from my family. You didn’t listen. Now? You lose.</p><p>She hit send.</p><p>And now?</p><p>They waited for Evanora Harkness’s next move.</p><p>Because the game was almost over.</p><p>And Agatha Harkness was about to win.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The house was still buzzing with energy—Agatha, Wanda, Rio, and Lilia were focused on Evanora’s next move, but Jen and Alice?</p><p>They had taken a moment to breathe.</p><p>Alice was perched on the couch, laptop balanced on her legs, fingers flying across the keyboard as she monitored Evanora’s network activity.</p><p>Jen leaned against the back of the couch, watching her with a lazy smirk.</p><p>“You know…” Jen drawled, tilting her head. “I think I just figured out your sexiest trait.”</p><p>Alice’s fingers paused for half a second, then she glanced up with an amused expression. “Oh? Just now?”</p><p>Jen chuckled. “Hey, I always knew you were hot, but this? This is next level.”</p><p>She gestured at Alice’s screen.</p><p>“You sitting there, hacking into billion-dollar networks, ruining evil corporations, looking all casual while doing it? That’s…” Jen whistled lowly. “Very attractive.”</p><p>Alice snorted. “You really do have a type, huh?”</p><p>Jen smirked. “What can I say? Smart women who could ruin my life are my weakness.”</p><p>Alice laughed, shaking her head. “That’s concerning.”</p><p>Jen leaned down, brushing a kiss against Alice’s shoulder. “It’s also true.”</p><p>Alice hummed in satisfaction but didn’t stop typing. “Mhm. You’re only into me because I can get into bank accounts.”</p><p>Jen grinned. “No, but it doesn’t hurt.”</p><p>Jen slid down onto the couch next to Alice, resting her chin on her hand, eyes still locked onto her girlfriend.</p><p>“You ever think about doing this for a living?” Jen asked. “Like, cybersecurity? Tech forensics?”</p><p>Alice smirked. “You trying to recruit me for some elite hacker task force?”</p><p>Jen chuckled. “No, I just—you’re good at this. Really good.”</p><p>Alice sighed, stretching her fingers. “It’s more of a hobby than a career. Journalism has always been the main goal.”</p><p>Jen raised an eyebrow. “Hacking billionaires is a hobby?”</p><p>Alice shrugged. “I grew up watching my mom destroy reputations for sport. It’s in the DNA.”</p><p>Jen smirked. “Ah yes, the legendary Lorna Wu.”</p><p>Alice nodded. “When your mother is a famous singer, the doors in this industry tend to open a lot easier.”</p><p>Jen exhaled. “Yeah, that tracks.”</p><p>Alice tapped her screen. “That’s why I prefer being behind the scenes. I want to prove I can do this on my own, not just because I’m Lorna Wu’s daughter.”</p><p>Jen watched her, eyes softening.</p><p>“You know,” she murmured, “you don’t have to prove anything to me.”</p><p>Alice looked up, slightly surprised by the sudden tenderness in Jen’s tone.</p><p>Jen smiled, reaching out to tuck a loose strand of hair behind Alice’s ear.</p><p>“You’re brilliant, all on your own. No big-name legacy required.”</p><p>Alice swallowed.</p><p>There was something about the way Jen said it—like she meant every word, like she’d fight anyone who said otherwise.</p><p>Alice leaned in, nudging her nose against Jen’s.</p><p>“You’re smooth, Kale.”</p><p>Jen grinned. “I try.”</p><p>Alice finally closed the gap, kissing her softly, her fingers threading into Jen’s hair.</p><p>For a moment, they forgot the chaos outside.</p><p>The looming war, the threats, the danger.</p><p>For a moment, it was just them.</p><p>Alice pulled back slightly, brushing her thumb over Jen’s jaw.</p><p>“You’re distracting me,” she whispered.</p><p>Jen smirked. “That was the plan.”</p><p>Before Alice could respond, the door swung open.</p><p>Wanda leaned against the frame, arms crossed, clearly amused.</p><p>“Oh, don’t mind me,” she teased. “Just checking to see if you two are still actually working or if I need to start charging for private moments in my house.”</p><p>Alice groaned. “Go away, Maximoff.”</p><p>Jen grinned. “I mean, in our defense, we’re very efficient multitaskers.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes. “Sure you are. Anyway, wrap up your love fest. We have a meeting in ten minutes.”</p><p>She winked before shutting the door.</p><p>Alice sighed dramatically, leaning back into the couch. “I hate her.”</p><p>Jen smirked, nudging her. “No, you don’t.”</p><p>Alice sighed. “No, I don’t.”</p><p>Jen kissed her again, lingering this time. “C’mon, hacker girl. Let’s go save the world.”</p><p>Alice smiled against her lips.</p><p>“Fine. But only because you asked nicely.”</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>The tension in the house had settled into a false calm.</p><p>Everyone was on edge, waiting for Evanora’s retaliation, but for the moment, nothing had happened.</p><p>That changed at exactly 10:42 PM.</p><p>Alice’s laptop screen flickered, the background noise of security feeds and tracking logs suddenly disrupting.</p><p>Then, an alert popped up.</p><p>Alice’s stomach dropped.</p><p>“Shit.”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up. “What?”</p><p>Alice’s fingers flew over the keyboard. “She found us.”</p><p>Before anyone could process that, all the lights in the house flickered.</p><p>Then—a total blackout.</p><p>Agatha shot up from her seat. “Everyone, get moving—now.”</p><p>Alice’s laptop glowed in the dark, the only source of light left.</p><p>Alice’s voice was sharp. “This isn’t just a power outage—she shut down the grid in this area.”</p><p>Agatha swore under her breath. “Then that means she has people nearby.”</p><p>As if on cue—</p><p>The first gunshot rang out.</p><p>Everyone hit the floor.</p><p>Rio crawled toward the window, peeking through the blinds.</p><p>Outside, black SUVs had pulled up along the perimeter of the house.</p><p>Men in tactical gear were already spreading out, moving with calculated precision.</p><p>Rio’s heart pounded.</p><p>“They’re here.”</p><p>Jen was already moving. “Where are the exits?”</p><p>Wanda whispered sharply. “We have a tunnel. Old exit my dad built under the house—it leads about two blocks away.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze snapped to Alice. “Can you delay them?”</p><p>Alice’s fingers flew over the keys, her face set in determination.</p><p>“I can reroute their communications for a few minutes, but that’s it.”</p><p>Rio grabbed Agatha’s arm. “Go. Now.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate.</p><p>“Everyone, to the tunnel—now.”</p><p>They moved fast but careful, following Wanda through the darkened halls.</p><p>They reached the hidden entrance—a small storage room with a trapdoor leading to an underground passage.</p><p>One by one, they disappeared inside.</p><p>Until only Agatha, Rio, and Wanda were left.</p><p>Then—</p><p>The front door burst open.</p><p>Evanora Harkness stepped into the house like she owned the place.</p><p>Flanked by armed guards, she took a slow, deliberate step forward, her heels clicking against the floor.</p><p>Her eyes scanned the dimly lit room, a smirk curling at her lips.</p><p>“Running, Agatha?” she mocked. “I expected more from you.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “I was expecting a warrant, not mercenaries.”</p><p>Evanora laughed, tilting her head. “Darling, you still think this is about legalities?”</p><p>Her eyes flicked toward Rio, who was standing protectively beside Agatha, her grip tight on a blade.</p><p>Evanora’s smirk widened.</p><p>“Ah. And you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. “You really should’ve stayed at home.”</p><p>Evanora’s expression darkened. “And you should have stayed dead.”</p><p>Before Agatha could stop her, Rio lunged.</p><p>Rio moved fast, knife flashing in the dim light—</p><p>But Evanora’s guards were faster.</p><p>The moment she stepped forward, one of them slammed the butt of a rifle into Rio’s ribs, sending her crashing against the wall.</p><p>Agatha immediately reacted, stepping between them before they could go further.</p><p>Evanora sighed. “Predictable.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes burned with fury. “You just can’t stand the fact that you lost.”</p><p>Evanora tilted her head. “Lost?”</p><p>She took one slow step forward.</p><p>“You think I lost?”</p><p>Her gaze flicked toward Rio, who was gritting her teeth through the pain.</p><p>Then back to Agatha.</p><p>“No, darling.” Her smile was pure venom. “You did.”</p><p>At that moment, another gunshot rang out.</p><p>Agatha felt her heart stop.</p><p>Not because she was hit.</p><p>But because someone else was.</p><p>Her head snapped toward Rio.</p><p>And for the third time, Agatha watched the person she loved fall to the ground.</p>

<p>Agatha didn’t remember screaming, but she must have, because the moment Rio collapsed, the world blurred around her.</p><p>One second, Rio was standing, ready to fight.</p><p>The next?</p><p>She was on the floor, blood pooling beneath her.</p><p>Agatha dropped to her knees, hands shaking as she pressed against Rio’s wound.</p><p>“Rio—stay with me, you hear me?” Agatha’s voice broke, panic clawing its way into her throat.</p><p>Rio coughed, her eyes hazy with pain, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps.</p><p>“…That’s gonna… leave a mark,” she muttered, trying for a smirk.</p><p>Agatha let out a choked, hysterical laugh, tears blurring her vision. “Shut up.”</p><p>Her hands were covered in blood.</p><p>Too much.</p><p>Too fast.</p><p>Evanora’s voice cut through the chaos, smooth and cruel.</p><p>“What a shame. You really thought you could win, didn’t you?”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up, her eyes burning with fury.</p><p>Evanora’s smirk widened. “Maybe now you’ll learn, darling.”</p><p>She turned to her men. “Kill them both.”</p><p>Before the guards could raise their weapons, a deafening bang rang out.</p><p>One of Evanora’s men crumpled to the floor.</p><p>Then—</p><p>More gunfire.</p><p>The room erupted into chaos.</p><p>Through the haze, Agatha heard Wanda’s voice.</p><p>“GO!”</p><p>Wanda had reappeared, gun in hand, firing with precision, forcing Evanora’s forces into defensive positions.</p><p>Behind her, Jen and Alice emerged from the tunnel entrance, also armed.</p><p>Jen aimed at one of the men. “I’d drop that gun if I were you.”</p><p>Alice, crouched behind cover, looked both terrified and determined. “Okay, so this was NOT the plan—”</p><p>“MOVE!” Wanda yelled.</p><p>Agatha snapped back to reality.</p><p>She hooked her arms under Rio, ignoring the pain screaming in her own body, and hauled her up.</p><p>Rio let out a sharp groan, her fingers weakly gripping Agatha’s sleeve.</p><p>“Hey, hey—stay awake,” Agatha whispered, desperate. “Just hold on.”</p><p>Rio’s head lolled against her shoulder.</p><p>Agatha’s heart clenched.</p><p>With bullets flying, the group retreated, Agatha staggering under Rio’s weight.</p><p>“Back to the tunnel!” Wanda shouted.</p><p>Alice covered them as they rushed inside, the walls shaking from the force of the gunfire outside.</p><p>The moment they cleared the exit, Jen slammed the hatch shut, bolting it behind them.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Panting.</p><p>Rio slumped against Agatha, barely conscious.</p><p>Alice frantically checked her pulse. “She’s alive—but we need to move, NOW.”</p><p>Wanda grabbed Jen’s arm. “Get the car ready. We’re not losing her.”</p><p>Jen bolted for the exit.</p><p>Agatha looked down at Rio’s pale face, the blood soaking through her shirt.</p><p>Then, for the first time in years, she prayed.</p><p>“Just hold on,” she whispered, pressing her forehead to Rio’s. “Please.”</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The drive to the safe hospital felt both too long and too short.</p><p>Wanda drove like a woman possessed, tires screeching as they sped through the city.</p><p>In the backseat, Agatha held onto Rio, keeping pressure on the wound.</p><p>Rio’s breathing was shallow, her lips too pale.</p><p>“Talk to me, babe,” Agatha murmured. “Tell me something stupid.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flickered open, her voice a weak rasp.</p><p>“…You’re so bossy.”</p><p>Agatha let out a broken laugh, her tears dripping onto Rio’s cheek.</p><p>“Yeah? Well, you’re an idiot.”</p><p>Rio gave her a barely-there smirk.</p><p>Agatha brushed the hair from her face, her voice trembling.</p><p>“If you die, I will kill you, do you hear me?”</p><p>Rio’s fingers weakly squeezed hers. “Bad… logic…”</p><p>Agatha laughed again, choking on a sob.</p><p>“God, I love you.”</p><p>Rio’s lips barely moved, but Agatha saw it—</p><p>“Love you too.”</p><p>Then, her eyes closed.</p><p>And Agatha’s heart shattered.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The hospital doors burst open, the emergency team rushing Rio away before Agatha could even process what was happening.</p><p>She stumbled forward, but Jen caught her.</p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>“DON’T—” Agatha’s voice cracked as she shoved Jen’s hands away.</p><p>Her hands were still stained with Rio’s blood.</p><p>She felt numb. Hollow.</p><p>She barely registered Wanda’s arms around her, pulling her into a tight hold.</p><p>She barely heard Alice’s quiet sobs.</p><p>All she knew—</p><p>Was that Rio was somewhere beyond those doors.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The hospital waiting room was suffocating.</p><p>Agatha sat in a stiff plastic chair, elbows on her knees, fingers digging into her scalp. Her body was still covered in Rio’s blood, but she couldn’t bring herself to move.</p><p>Not until she knew.</p><p>Not until she heard the words that would decide everything.</p><p>Across from her, Wanda and Jen sat in silence. Jen was gripping Alice’s hand so tightly their knuckles were white. Alice’s eyes were red, but she didn’t speak.</p><p>Nobody did.</p><p>Every few minutes, Wanda would check her phone, like expecting some sort of miracle to arrive via text.</p><p>But there was nothing.</p><p>Only the cold, sterile air of the waiting room.</p><p>And silence.</p><p>A nurse walked past, and Agatha’s head snapped up.</p><p>“Excuse me—” her voice cracked. “Is there any news on Rio Vidal?”</p><p>The nurse hesitated. “The doctors are still working—”</p><p>Agatha stood so fast her chair scraped the floor. “I need to see her.”</p><p>“Miss, I—”</p><p>“I NEED TO SEE HER.”</p><p>The nurse looked taken aback, but firm. “I’m sorry, but she’s still in surgery—”</p><p>Agatha let out a strangled sound, something between a sob and a growl of frustration. She turned, pacing the room, running her hands through her hair, her chest tightening.</p><p>She felt trapped, like the walls were closing in.</p><p>She couldn’t just sit here.</p><p>Not while Rio was bleeding out behind some sterile door.</p><p>Not while her whole world was hanging by a thread.</p><p>Wanda was up in a second, grabbing Agatha’s wrists gently.</p><p>“Hey, hey—look at me.”</p><p>Agatha’s breathing was uneven, her eyes unfocused.</p><p>“She’s gonna be okay,” Wanda whispered, squeezing her hands. “Rio’s tough as hell. You know that.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head violently. “She’s been through too much already. And this time—this time—”</p><p>Her voice broke.</p><p>And suddenly, she was crying.</p><p>Not silent tears. Not quiet grief.</p><p>Full, gut-wrenching sobs.</p><p>Wanda pulled her into a tight hug, holding her together as she completely fell apart.</p><p>“I can’t lose her, Wanda,” Agatha choked out. “I—I can’t.”</p><p>Wanda stroked her back, whispering soothing words, but nothing could fix this.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The doors to the surgical ward swung open, and a doctor rushed out, her expression tense.</p><p>“We need a blood donor—now.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped. “What?”</p><p>The doctor barely paused. “Rio lost too much blood. She’s O-negative, and our reserves are dangerously low.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then—</p><p>“I’m a match.”</p><p>Alice.</p><p>Agatha and Jen whipped around.</p><p>Alice was already standing, her jaw set, determined. “She can take as much as she needs. Just—save her.”</p><p>The doctor nodded briskly. “Come with me.”</p><p>Jen grabbed Alice’s wrist. “Are you sure?”</p><p>Alice’s eyes softened. “It’s Rio, Jen.”</p><p>That was all she needed to say.</p><p>She squeezed Jen’s hand once, then disappeared down the hallway.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, watching Alice go.</p><p>Rio was fighting.</p><p>Now, so was Alice.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>As soon as Alice was gone, Agatha pulled out her phone.</p><p>She didn’t hesitate. Didn’t breathe. Just dialed.</p><p>Lilia picked up after the first ring.</p><p>“Agatha, I was just about to—”</p><p>“She needs security. Now.”</p><p>Lilia immediately shut up. “What happened?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, forcing her shaking voice to stay steady.</p><p>“She was shot.”</p><p>A beat of silence. Then—</p><p>“I’ll handle it.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply. “Hire the best. I don’t care how much it costs. And get to the judge—tonight.”</p><p>“Consider it done.”</p><p>Click.</p><p>The moment the call ended, Agatha slumped against the wall, her head falling back against the cold tile.</p><p>She had done all she could.</p><p>Now?</p><p>She had to wait.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Meanwhile, Wanda was already moving.</p><p>She pulled out her own phone, dialing a different number.</p><p>The foster house.</p><p>Billy.</p><p>She knew she was about to do something reckless. Something that would get her in trouble.</p><p>But she didn’t care.</p><p>After two rings, Billy picked up.</p><p>“Wanda?” His voice was small, tired.</p><p>Wanda took a breath. “Pack a bag, kid. I’m coming to get you.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then Billy exhaled shakily. “You’re serious?”</p><p>“Dead serious.”</p><p>Billy hesitated. “Wanda, if they catch you—”</p><p>“I don’t care.”</p><p>Because she couldn’t leave him there.</p><p>Not while the world was burning.</p><p>Not while Evanora was still out there.</p><p>Billy had suffered enough.</p><p>And Wanda Maximoff was done playing by the rules.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Back at the hospital, the waiting continued.</p><p>Alice had been gone for over an hour, donating as much blood as she safely could.</p><p>Agatha sat beside Jen, staring at the doors that separated them from Rio.</p><p>Jen exhaled softly. “She’s gonna be okay.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>She just held onto that hope with everything she had left.</p><p>Because she had lost too much already.</p><p>And she couldn’t lose Rio too.</p><p>Not now.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The world was hazy—a floating, dreamlike space where pain and warmth clashed together.</p><p>Voices murmured in the background, blurred and distant, like echoes through water.</p><p>Then, something anchored Rio.</p><p>A hand.</p><p>Warm. Steady. Familiar.</p><p>And then, a voice.</p><p>“Please, baby… just wake up.”</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Rio’s eyelids fluttered.</p><p>The darkness faded into a soft, sterile glow. A ceiling. Machines beeping. The faint scent of antiseptic.</p><p>Her throat was dry, her limbs heavy.</p><p>But the first thing she saw—</p><p>Agatha, curled up in the chair beside her, gripping her hand like she was terrified to let go.</p><p>Her Agatha.</p><p>Rio tried to speak, but all that came out was a weak croak.</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up.</p><p>Her eyes were red-rimmed, exhausted—but the moment she saw Rio’s, something inside her shattered.</p><p>“Oh my God,” she whispered. “Rio.”</p><p>Rio licked her cracked lips, swallowing thickly. “Hey,” she rasped.</p><p>Agatha let out a sound that was half-laugh, half-sob, and suddenly, she was leaning over, pressing a kiss to Rio’s knuckles.</p><p>“You scared the shit out of me,” Agatha murmured, voice shaking.</p><p>Rio smirked weakly. “Sounds like me.”</p><p>Agatha laughed through her tears, pressing her forehead against their joined hands.</p><p>The relief was overwhelming.</p><p>Agatha wiped her eyes, taking a deep breath before gently brushing Rio’s hair back.</p><p>“Do you remember what happened?”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly. Fragments of memory pieced together.</p><p>Evanora.<br/>The gun.<br/>The searing pain.<br/>Agatha’s face above hers, begging her to hold on.</p><p>She exhaled. “Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened, but she nodded. “You’re safe. We got you out.”</p><p>Rio let her head sink deeper into the pillow. “And the others?”</p><p>“They’re fine.” Agatha smiled softly. “Alice donated blood for you. She passed out right after, but she’s okay.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened slightly. “Alice?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “She refused to let anyone else do it.”</p><p>Rio huffed a weak laugh. “That’s… very on-brand.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile faded slightly, her fingers tightening around Rio’s.</p><p>“Wanda took Billy,” she admitted. “She broke into the foster house and got him out. She hasn’t checked in yet, but I know she’s on the move.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach twisted. “She’s gonna get in trouble.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled. “Yeah.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then—</p><p>Rio squeezed Agatha’s hand weakly. “You stayed.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “What?”</p><p>“You stayed,” Rio repeated. “Through… everything. You’re still here.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened. “Of course I am.”</p><p>Rio smiled, exhaustion tugging at her again. “Love you, bossy.”</p><p>Agatha laughed wetly. “Love you too, idiot.”</p><p>Rio hummed, letting her eyes drift closed again.</p><p>And this time, Agatha didn’t panic.</p><p>This time, she knew Rio would wake up again.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Jen was sitting on the floor outside Rio’s hospital room, head leaned back against the wall.</p><p>Alice was still asleep beside her, exhausted from the blood loss.</p><p>Agatha stepped out quietly, rubbing her tired eyes.</p><p>Jen glanced up. “She awake?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yeah.”</p><p>Jen let out a long sigh of relief. “Thank God.”</p><p>Agatha sat down beside her, pressing her head against the wall.</p><p>“She’s okay,” Agatha murmured, as if saying it out loud would make it more real. “She’s really okay.”</p><p>Jen nudged her shoulder. “And so are you.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breathy laugh, shaking her head. “Debatable.”</p><p>Jen smirked. “You wanna debate, Harkness? I’ll take you to court.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her lips twitched. “Shut up, Kale.”</p><p>Jen nudged her again. “I mean it. You’ve been carrying all of this—you, Wanda, Rio. You haven’t even had a second to breathe.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>Jen sighed. “You don’t have to do this alone, Ags.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly.</p><p>Then, finally—she nodded.</p><p>Jen smiled. “Good.”</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The hospital was quiet, but outside?</p><p>The world was about to explode.</p><p>Across the city, news headlines were already circulating</p><p>Evanora Harkness Under Investigation for Corruption and Abuse</p><p>Legal Dynasty Crumbling as More Evidence Surfaces</p><p>Survivors of ‘Conversion Camps’ Speak Out</p><p>And behind the scenes, Lilia was already working, filing legal action against every single connection Evanora still had.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>The final days before the war ended.</p><p>And Evanora Harkness?</p><p>She was running out of time.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Somewhere in a high-rise penthouse, Evanora Harkness sat at a sleek, glass desk, a tumbler of whiskey in one hand, her phone in the other.</p><p>Her empire was crumbling.</p><p>Her finances had been frozen.<br/>Her political allies were jumping ship.<br/>And now?</p><p>The media was devouring her alive.</p><p>But Evanora didn’t panic.</p><p>No, she was far too calculating for that.</p><p>Instead, she swirled the whiskey in her glass, her cold blue eyes narrowing as she studied the information on her screen.</p><p>Then, she smirked.</p><p>“If they want war,” she murmured, taking a slow sip, “then let’s give them one.”</p><p>She dialed a number.</p><p>The voice on the other end answered immediately.</p><p>Evanora’s smirk widened.</p><p>“It’s time to remind my daughter exactly who she’s dealing with.”</p><p>~~~~</p><p>It started at sunrise.</p><p>A fleet of black SUVs pulled up outside the hospital where Rio was recovering.</p><p>Agatha and Alice had just stepped out to grab coffee when they saw them.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped.</p><p>Men in suits. Federal agents.</p><p>A man stepped forward, flipping open a badge. “Miss Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “That depends. Who’s asking?”</p><p>The man’s expression remained neutral. “You’re under arrest.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Agatha felt Alice tense beside her.</p><p>“For what?”</p><p>The agent sighed, like this was all just a formality. “For conspiracy, fraud, and obstruction of justice.”</p><p>Agatha almost laughed.</p><p>Evanora was playing dirty.</p><p>Alice stepped forward. “This is bullshit—”</p><p>The agent ignored her. “Miss Harkness, if you resist, we will escalate force.”</p><p>Agatha took a slow breath, her rage bubbling just beneath the surface.</p><p>She wasn’t stupid. Fighting would make it worse.</p><p>So instead, she raised her hands calmly.</p><p>And then, as they snapped the cuffs around her wrists, she smirked.</p><p>“Tell my mother,” she drawled, dripping with venom, “that this was a mistake.”</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Inside the hospital, Rio was still weak, but the second Alice rushed into her room, her heart lurched.</p><p>“Agatha just got arrested.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Alice grabbed her jacket. “We need to move. Now.”</p><p>But Rio wasn’t hearing her anymore.</p><p>She was already swinging her legs over the bed, wincing at the pain, but determined.</p><p>Alice sighed. “You’re in no condition—”</p><p>“I don’t care,” Rio snapped. “Where did they take her?”</p><p>Alice clenched her jaw. “Federal holding. They’re treating her like a white-collar criminal, but this is Evanora’s move. We need Lilia.”</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply.</p><p>Then, she reached for her phone.</p><p>If Evanora thought she could just take Agatha away and get away with it—</p><p>She had no idea what was coming next.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Meanwhile, Wanda was still on the run with Billy.</p><p>They had crashed for the night in a safe house, but now?</p><p>Wanda’s phone was buzzing.</p><p>Billy was sitting across from her, eating dry cereal out of the box, when he saw her expression.</p><p>“…What’s wrong?”</p><p>Wanda’s grip on the phone tightened.</p><p>Lilia’s name flashed across the screen.</p><p>She immediately answered.</p><p>“Tell me you have good news,” Wanda snapped.</p><p>Lilia’s voice was measured but tense.</p><p>“The judge agreed to expedite the trial. We go to court in 48 hours.”</p><p>Wanda’s breath hitched.</p><p>“That’s it? We have a date?”</p><p>Lilia exhaled. “Due to security concerns, yes. But you know what this means, Maximoff.”</p><p>Wanda did.</p><p>48 hours.</p><p>That’s all the time they had to keep everyone alive.</p><p>To outmaneuver Evanora.</p><p>To finally end this.</p><p>Billy’s eyes widened slightly. “We’re almost done?”</p><p>Wanda stared at her phone, her grip tightening.</p><p>“…We’re almost there.”</p><p>But getting there?</p><p>Would be the hardest part yet.</p><p>The countdown had begun.</p><p>Lilia was moving, preparing the legal attack.<br/>Wanda was getting Billy somewhere safe.<br/>Rio and Alice were planning their next step.</p><p>And Agatha?</p><p>Agatha was sitting in a holding cell, waiting for the war to end.</p><p>48 hours.</p><p>That’s all they had.</p><p>48 hours to survive.</p><p>48 hours until it was over.</p><p>One way or another.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>47 Hours Left</p><p>The cold, sterile walls of the holding cell weren’t unfamiliar to Agatha.</p><p>She had spent enough time in courtrooms, legal offices, and jails during her law studies to recognize the psychological game at play.</p><p>They wanted her to feel powerless.</p><p>To break.</p><p>But if Evanora thought she would cower, she was sorely mistaken.</p><p>Agatha leaned back against the metal bench, arms crossed, eyes closed in forced relaxation.</p><p>Footsteps approached. The clink of keys.</p><p>A guard spoke. “Your lawyer is here.”</p><p>Agatha stood slowly, smoothing out the wrinkles of her shirt before allowing herself to be escorted out.</p><p>As she stepped into the small, dimly lit interrogation room, she saw Lilia Calderu sitting across the table.</p><p>Her mentor looked composed as ever, but there was a sharp edge to her expression.</p><p>“Nice to see you again, Counselor,” Agatha said dryly as she sat down.</p><p>Lilia didn’t waste time. “They’re keeping you here under trumped-up charges. I’m working to get you released, but Evanora has leverage in the system.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “Of course she does.”</p><p>Lilia folded her hands on the table. “Do you trust me, Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. “Always.”</p><p>Lilia exhaled, nodding. “Then sit tight. Your time in here is temporary. We’re almost at the end.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, but there was no humor in it.</p><p>“Oh, I know,” she said softly.</p><p>“And she does too.”</p><p> </p><p>45 Hours</p><p>Back at the hospital, Rio was pacing.</p><p>Her stitches pulled with every step, but she ignored it.</p><p>Alice sat on the edge of the bed, watching her with cautious eyes. “You need to rest.”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Resting is how you get killed in this fight.”</p><p>Alice’s jaw clenched. “You can’t just storm in there and take Agatha back.”</p><p>Rio stopped, pinning Alice with a glare. “Why not? Because that’s exactly what Evanora is counting on. That we’ll sit here and play nice while she dismantles everything we’ve built.”</p><p>Alice sighed, rubbing her temples. “I didn’t say do nothing. I just don’t want you to get yourself killed.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Oh, so now you’re the careful one?”</p><p>Alice grinned. “I contain my recklessness for moments that matter.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “Unbelievable.”</p><p>Alice’s smile faded slightly. “I get it, Rio. You love her. And I know you’d burn the world down for her.”</p><p>Rio exhaled. “Yeah.”</p><p>Alice stood, gripping Rio’s shoulders. “Then be smart about it. We only have one shot at winning this.”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>Because Alice was right.</p><p>They couldn’t afford to make a single mistake.</p><p> </p><p>44 Hours</p><p>Across town, Wanda sat in an abandoned parking lot, Billy beside her, both of them watching the phone screen.</p><p>“Are you sure about this?” Billy asked, his voice quiet.</p><p>Wanda didn’t look at him. Her focus was on the contact she was about to call.</p><p>“No,” she admitted.</p><p>Billy swallowed. “Then why do it?”</p><p>Wanda’s grip on the phone tightened.</p><p>“Because sometimes,” she whispered, “you don’t get to play it safe.”</p><p>Then, she pressed the call button.</p><p>The line rang.</p><p>And then—</p><p>A voice answered.</p><p>“Wanda Maximoff,” the deep, measured tone said. “I was wondering when you’d finally reach out.”</p><p>Wanda inhaled. “I need a favor.”</p><p>A chuckle. “I assumed you would. Tell me—how desperate are you?”</p><p>Wanda glanced at Billy.</p><p>Then, she turned away, voice hard as steel.</p><p>“Desperate enough.”</p><p> </p><p>42 Hours Left</p><p>Lilia sat at a round table inside a secure conference room.</p><p>Across from her were two high-profile attorneys, ones whose names carried as much weight as their wallets.</p><p>“I hope you understand the gravity of the situation,” one of them said, adjusting his tie.</p><p>Lilia smiled, sharp and cool. “Oh, I do.”</p><p>She leaned forward, placing a stack of files on the table.</p><p>“Which is why I’m offering you one chance to withdraw before this goes to court.”</p><p>The two attorneys exchanged glances.</p><p>One of them scoffed. “Evanora Harkness doesn’t lose.”</p><p>Lilia smirked. “Then you don’t know her daughter.”</p><p>She slid a single photograph across the table—one of Vertigo, the man who had been following them, the same one responsible for multiple attacks.</p><p>The attorneys’ eyes widened.</p><p>Lilia’s smile never wavered.</p><p>“If this goes to trial,” she continued, “we expose everything.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then—</p><p>One of them reached for his phone.</p><p>Lilia’s smirk widened.</p><p>Checkmate.</p><p> </p><p>40 Hours</p><p>Back in her penthouse, Evanora watched the city skyline, her mind turning over the latest developments.</p><p>Her phone buzzed.</p><p>She answered.</p><p>“What is it?” she asked.</p><p>A low voice responded, “They’re moving faster than expected.”</p><p>Evanora’s lips curled into a cruel smile.</p><p>“Then let’s remind them who they’re dealing with.”</p><p>She turned, pouring herself another glass of whiskey.</p><p>“They think they can win?” she mused.</p><p>She took a slow sip.</p><p>“Then we’ll burn the whole thing down before they do.”</p><p> </p><p>24 Hours</p><p>Lilia Calderu sat in her office, hands steepled together as she listened to the quiet chaos unfolding on the other end of the phone.</p><p>“The prosecution is bringing two more witnesses,” a junior attorney reported. “Former employees of Evanora’s firms. They claim to have seen direct orders about the conversion camps.”</p><p>Lilia smiled. Good.</p><p>“And Evanora?”</p><p>“Still trying to buy her way out,” the attorney admitted. “She’s offering settlements left and right.”</p><p>Lilia hummed, tapping her fingers against the desk. “Let her.”</p><p>“…Excuse me?”</p><p>Lilia’s voice was measured, calm. “Let her think it’s working. Let her believe she still has control.”</p><p>The attorney hesitated. “That’s risky.”</p><p>Lilia smirked. “No, dear. That’s strategy.”</p><p>She ended the call.</p><p>Then, she reached for her next piece of the puzzle.</p><p>And dialed the judge’s office.</p><p> </p><p>22 Hours</p><p>Wanda stood outside a run-down motel, arms crossed, Billy standing beside her.</p><p>He looked up, hesitant. “Are you sure about this?”</p><p>Wanda exhaled. “No.”</p><p>But it didn’t matter.</p><p>She knocked on the door.</p><p>A few seconds passed before it creaked open, revealing a gaunt, tired-looking man.</p><p>His eyes flickered between Wanda and Billy, suspicion clear. “You’re late.”</p><p>Wanda tilted her head. “You’re lucky we showed up at all.”</p><p>The man snorted, stepping aside.</p><p>Billy hesitated, glancing at Wanda.</p><p>She nodded. “Stay close.”</p><p>They stepped inside.</p><p>The door shut behind them.</p><p>And the deal for their next move began.</p><p> </p><p>20 Hours</p><p>Rio sat on the edge of her hospital bed, staring at her phone.</p><p>No updates. No calls. No messages.</p><p>Agatha was still locked up.</p><p>Her hands curled into fists, frustration boiling over.</p><p>Alice sat across from her, watching carefully. “I know that look.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened. “I should be out there.”</p><p>Alice sighed. “You’ll get your chance. But not like this.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “You sound like Agatha.”</p><p>Alice smirked. “That’s probably a good thing.”</p><p>Silence stretched between them.</p><p>Then—</p><p>Alice leaned forward. “You don’t have to save her, you know.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped up. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”</p><p>Alice held her gaze. “Agatha isn’t some damsel in distress. She’s already fighting. And if you walk into this without thinking, you’re gonna get yourself killed. Haven’t you reached this point what like 3 times by now?”</p><p>Rio gritted her teeth. “She needs me.”</p><p>Alice exhaled. “I know. But she also needs you alive.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers trembled against her knees.</p><p>Because as much as she hated to admit it—Alice was right.</p><p> </p><p>18 Hours Left</p><p>Agatha sat in her cell, waiting.</p><p>She knew the law.<br/>She knew the system.<br/>And she knew exactly what Evanora was doing.</p><p>So, when the door finally opened and an agent walked in, she wasn’t surprised.</p><p>He sat across from her, opening a manila folder.</p><p>“Miss Harkness,” he said smoothly, “I have an offer for you.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “I bet you do.”</p><p>The agent leaned forward. “We drop the charges. You walk free. In exchange, you withdraw from the case against your mother.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile faded.</p><p>She leaned back, crossing her arms. “Tell Evanora,” she said coolly, “that she’s running out of tricks.”</p><p>The agent sighed. “You realize, if you don’t take this deal, things could get worse.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “Worse than being raised by that woman?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The agent exhaled, closing the file. “Fine. Have it your way.”</p><p>Agatha watched him go, her expression impassive.</p><p>Because this?</p><p>This was just the beginning.</p><p> </p><p>12 Hours</p><p>The team gathered in Wanda’s house, tension thick in the air.</p><p>Lilia spread out the finalized case files across the table. “This is it.”</p><p>Alice exhaled. “Do we have everything?”</p><p>Lilia nodded. “More than enough.”</p><p>Wanda rubbed her temples. “Then why do I feel like this is a trap?”</p><p>Jen shrugged. “Because it probably is.”</p><p>Rio, sitting quietly, finally spoke. “It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>Everyone turned.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were dark, burning with determination.</p><p>“Trap or not,” she said, voice steady, “we finish this.”</p><p>Agatha was still behind bars.</p><p>Evanora was still standing.</p><p>And tomorrow?</p><p>That would change.</p><p>For good.</p><p> </p>

<p>The sun barely crested the horizon when the team gathered in the living room, the weight of the coming hours pressing down on them.</p><p>No one touched their coffee.<br/>No one made jokes.</p><p>This wasn’t a morning of small talk.</p><p>This was the day everything ended.</p><p>Lilia stood at the center of the room, files in hand, her expression calm but steely.</p><p>“Once we step into that courtroom,” she said, voice low and sharp, “we don’t leave until Evanora Harkness is destroyed.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then—</p><p>Jen nodded. “Good.”</p><p>Alice adjusted her blazer. “Let’s burn her to the ground.”</p><p>Wanda exhaled. “Time to end this.”</p><p>Rio, sitting at the kitchen counter, didn’t speak.</p><p>She didn’t need to.</p><p>Her eyes said everything.</p><p>Agatha was still in holding.</p><p>And today, they were bringing her home.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Inside the cold walls of the detention center, Agatha sat, waiting.</p><p>She had spent the night running every possible scenario in her head.</p><p>But the moment the cell door swung open, her mind snapped to the present.</p><p>A guard stepped in. “Harkness. You’re free to go.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart slammed against her ribs.</p><p>She stood slowly. “Excuse me?”</p><p>The guard shrugged. “Your lawyer made a deal. Charges dropped.”</p><p>Agatha felt her chest tighten.</p><p>Lilia.</p><p>She didn’t waste time asking questions.</p><p>She simply walked out.</p><p>And the second she stepped into the lobby—</p><p>Rio was there.</p><p>Her stitches still healing, standing with Alice and Wanda at her side.</p><p>The moment Agatha’s eyes landed on her, everything else disappeared.</p><p>Rio didn’t speak.</p><p>She just opened her arms.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>They arrived at the courthouse as a unit.</p><p>Lilia led them inside, her presence a force of nature, her every step calculated and commanding.</p><p>On the other side of the hall, Evanora Harkness stood, flanked by her legal team.</p><p>She met Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>And she smirked.</p><p>Like she still believed she had already won.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched.</p><p>Not today.</p><p>Not this time.</p><p>She turned to Lilia. “Let’s do this.”</p><p>Lilia nodded, pushing open the doors.</p><p>And the battle began.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The judge—a man in his early sixties, gray-haired and unreadable—took his seat.</p><p>The courtroom fell silent.</p><p>The bailiff’s voice rang out. “This court is now in session.”</p><p>The prosecution spoke first.</p><p>A young, ruthless-looking woman in a navy suit stood.</p><p>She turned to the jury, her voice smooth and sharp.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness is a woman who built her empire on the suffering of others.”</p><p>She stepped forward.</p><p>“She has funded illegal conversion camps. She has tampered with evidence. She has issued bribes and threats to silence those who would speak the truth.”</p><p>The jury shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>The prosecution’s voice didn’t waver.</p><p>“Today, we prove—beyond a shadow of a doubt—that she is guilty.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then, Evanora’s lead attorney stood.</p><p>A well-polished man with a practiced smile.</p><p>“Members of the jury,” he began, “what my colleagues have presented to you is a story.”</p><p>He turned toward Evanora, his tone measured.</p><p>“But the truth? The truth is much simpler.”</p><p>He gestured vaguely.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness is a successful businesswoman. A mother. A pillar of this city. And today, we will prove her innocence.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The judge nodded.</p><p>“Proceed.”</p><p>And the trial began.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The courtroom was silent as Alice Wu-Gulliver took the stand.</p><p>She sat tall and poised, her dark eyes scanning the room, locking onto Evanora for the briefest second before settling on the prosecutor.</p><p>The prosecutor approached, his expression calm and steady.</p><p>“Please state your name and occupation for the record.”</p><p>Alice adjusted the microphone. “Alice Wu-Gulliver. Investigative journalist<em>.</em>”</p><p>The prosecutor nodded. “Miss Wu-Gulliver, can you tell the court what your investigation uncovered regarding Evanora Harkness?”</p><p>Alice inhaled deeply, then began.</p><p>“I started investigating Evanora Harkness over a year ago,” Alice said, her voice firm and unwavering.</p><p>“I was looking into questionable financial transactions linked to various organizations, including privately funded rehabilitation centers and behavioral correction facilities.”</p><p>She reached for a document in front of her and held it up.</p><p>“This,” she continued, “is a financial record from one of the firms tied to Evanora’s conglomerate. It shows a series of large, anonymous donations sent to facilities labeled as ‘youth rehabilitation programs.’”</p><p>The prosecutor took the document and handed it to the jury.</p><p>Alice’s gaze darkened.</p><p>“These weren’t rehab centers,” she said, her voice cutting through the room.</p><p>“These were conversion camps.”</p><p>Murmurs rippled through the courtroom.</p><p>Evanora’s lawyer shifted, but Alice didn’t stop.</p><p>She turned toward the jury, her expression grave.</p><p>“These facilities operated under the guise of helping troubled youth, but in reality, they used physical, emotional, and psychological abuse to force LGBTQ+ minors into suppressing their identities.”</p><p>She paused, letting it sink in.</p><p>Then, she pulled out another document.</p><p>“This is an email chain,” she said, sliding it onto the table. “It details a direct approval for funding from Evanora’s office.”</p><p>The prosecution lifted the pages, scanning them before handing them off to be submitted as evidence.</p><p>Alice’s voice dropped lower, sharper.</p><p>“She knew exactly what she was funding. And she didn’t care.”</p><p>The prosecutor stepped closer. “Miss Wu-Gulliver, did your investigation reveal any attempts to silence those who opposed these operations?”</p><p>Alice’s jaw tightened.</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “Several whistleblowers tried to come forward over the years.”</p><p>She reached for another folder and pulled out a list of names.</p><p>“Four of these individuals have been reported missing.”</p><p>The jury stiffened.</p><p>Alice kept going.</p><p>“One of them, Rebecca, was a former employee. She managed to leak documents proving the use of electroshock therapy, starvation tactics, and forced isolation.”</p><p>The courtroom stirred in horror.</p><p>Alice’s grip on the microphone tightened.</p><p>“A while after her statement went public, she vanished.”</p><p>Silence weighed heavily on the room.</p><p>Alice turned back to Evanora.</p><p>“She’s not just corrupt.

Tampering with evidence?”</p><p>He shook his head in mock disappointment.</p><p>“It seems to me that you’re willing to bend the law when it suits you.”</p><p>Alice tilted her head, unbothered.</p><p>“Is that a statement or a question?”</p><p>A small murmur of approval rippled through the room.</p><p>The lawyer’s smile tightened.</p><p>He sighed, acting disappointed. “I think the jury can see that your credibility is—”</p><p>Alice cut him off.</p><p>“Would you like to discuss the hitmen your client sent after me?”</p><p>The lawyer froze.</p><p>A tense silence fell over the room.</p><p>Alice’s smirk returned.</p><p>“That’s right,” she said smoothly. “Let’s talk about how I almost died because of your client’s orders.”</p><p>The lawyer’s jaw clenched.</p><p>He glanced at Evanora.</p><p>For the first time since the trial began—</p><p>She looked displeased.</p><p>Alice leaned forward.</p><p>“You tried to bury this.”</p><p>She glanced at Evanora, eyes burning.</p><p>“But you should have known better than to go after a journalist.”</p><p>The jury watched every moment.</p><p>The judge let the silence linger.</p><p>And Alice?</p><p>Alice just sat back, crossing her arms.</p><p>Because for the first time in this entire war—</p><p>Evanora Harkness was on the defensive.</p><p>And Alice was just getting started.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>The courtroom was dead silent as the next witness was called.</p><p>The bailiff’s voice rang out:</p><p>“Wanda Maximoff, please take the stand.”</p><p>Wanda rose from her seat, her movements measured but firm.</p><p>She had spent years keeping her emotions locked away, hiding them behind wit, behind distractions, behind a life too busy to dwell on the past.</p><p>But now?</p><p>Now, she was done hiding.</p><p>She walked to the witness stand, taking her seat, adjusting the microphone.</p><p>Across the room, Evanora Harkness watched her like a predator.</p><p>But Wanda didn’t flinch.</p><p>She met Evanora’s gaze with unshaken steel.</p><p>And then, the prosecutor stepped forward.</p><p>“Miss Maximoff,” he said, “please state your name and occupation for the court.”</p><p>Wanda took a steady breath.</p><p>“Wanda Maximoff. Director, screenwriter, and producer.”</p><p>The prosecutor nodded. “Miss Maximoff, can you tell us about your connection to William Kaplan?”</p><p>Silence stretched.</p><p>Wanda’s fingers curled tightly in her lap.</p><p>Then, she spoke.</p><p>“I met Billy through Rio Vidal,” she said. “She took him in when he had nowhere else to go.”</p><p>The prosecutor leaned forward. “And why did Billy need a place to go?”</p><p>Wanda’s jaw tightened.</p><p>“Because he ran away from his foster home,” she said firmly.</p><p>The jury shifted.</p><p>The prosecutor’s voice was gentle but firm. “And why did he run?”</p><p>Wanda exhaled slowly.</p><p>“Because he was being abused.”</p><p>A heavy silence filled the courtroom.</p><p>She turned her gaze to Evanora.</p><p>“And she tried to send him back.”</p><p>The prosecutor picked up a folder.</p><p>“Miss Maximoff, in your attempt to adopt William Kaplan, did you come across any legal roadblocks?”</p><p>Wanda let out a slow exhale.</p><p>“Yes.

That my career was too unstable. That <em>I </em>was unstable.”</p><p>Her jaw tightened.</p><p>“She dug into my past. Found out that I sought professional help after my family died.”</p><p>She turned her gaze to Evanora.</p><p>“And she tried to use that against me.”</p><p>Evanora remained unmoved.</p><p>The prosecutor turned to the jury. “So to clarify—Evanora Harkness, a woman with no legal standing in this case, actively attempted to prevent you from adopting a child in need?”</p><p>Wanda’s gaze darkened.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Murmurs spread through the jury.</p><p>But Wanda wasn’t finished.</p><p>She turned back to the prosecution.</p><p>“And that wasn’t the worst of it.”</p><p>The prosecutor tilted his head. “Please explain.”</p><p>Wanda inhaled sharply.</p><p>Then, she looked directly at the jury.</p><p>“Evanora didn’t just try to block me.

He’s a survivor of a conversion camp.”</p><p>The jury visibly reacted.</p><p>Wanda pressed forward.</p><p>“He was sent there twice. By his foster family.”</p><p>Her voice dropped lower.</p><p>“Guess who helped fund it.”</p><p>The jury didn’t need to guess.</p><p>Every head turned toward Evanora.</p><p>The prosecutor slid another stack of files onto the table.</p><p>“These documents confirm that Evanora Harkness’s corporate accounts made regular, undisclosed donations to the very facility that tortured Tommy.”</p><p>The jury looked sick.</p><p>Wanda’s voice cut through the weight of the room.</p><p>“She is a monster. And if she walks free today, she’ll keep ruining lives.”</p><p>Evanora’s attorney stood abruptly.</p><p>“Objection—irrelevant speculation.”</p><p>The judge glared at him.</p><p>“I’ll decide what’s irrelevant, counselor.”</p><p>He turned back to Wanda.</p><p>“You may continue.”</p><p>Wanda held back a smirk.</p><p>And Evanora?</p><p>For the first time all trial—</p><p>She looked angry.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The lead defense attorney stood, buttoning his suit jacket.</p><p>“Miss Maximoff,” he said smoothly, “you have a personal grudge against my client, do you not?”</p><p>Wanda raised a brow.</p><p>“No more than she has against me.”</p><p>The lawyer smiled thinly.</p><p>“But you’ve taken active steps to disrupt her legal standing, have you not? You’ve actively fought against her attempts to maintain law and order.”</p><p>A dark chuckle slipped from Wanda’s lips.</p><p>“Is that what we’re calling kidnapping a child these days?”</p><p>The lawyer’s jaw tightened.</p><p>Wanda leaned forward slightly.</p><p>“You want to paint me as reckless?

I’m sixteen.”</p><p>The prosecutor nodded.</p><p>“William, can you tell the court about your experiences in the foster system?”</p><p>Billy’s jaw clenched.</p><p>He exhaled slowly, then began.</p><p>“I was taken into foster care when I was young,” he said. “After my parents… died.”</p><p>He didn’t look at the jury.</p><p>Instead, he kept his focus on one point on the table.</p><p>“I moved from home to home. Some were okay. Some were…”</p><p>He hesitated.</p><p>Then, he forced himself to say it.</p><p>“…bad.”</p><p>The prosecutor waited. “Can you clarify what you mean by ‘bad’?”</p><p>Billy’s fingers dug into his palms.</p><p>Then, he told them.</p><p>“My first foster family didn’t let me eat with them,” Billy said, voice quiet but strong.</p><p>The jury stiffened.</p><p>“I had to wait until everyone else was done. Whatever was left, I could have.”</p><p>His stomach tightened, remembering the hunger.</p><p>“My second home had a lock on the fridge.”</p><p>The courtroom was deathly silent.</p><p>“My third home…” Billy hesitated. “The dad drank a lot.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for a second.</p><p>Rio’s fingers curled into a fist.</p><p>Billy took a deep breath.</p><p>“He liked to break things when he was drunk. Sometimes it was the furniture. Sometimes it was us.”</p><p>Someone in the jury visibly winced.</p><p>Billy pressed forward.</p><p>“But the last foster home I ran away from?”</p><p>His grip on the stand tightened.</p><p>“That one was the worst.”</p><p>The prosecutor nodded, his expression unreadable. “Can you tell us why you ran?”</p><p>Billy’s throat tightened.</p><p>His eyes flickered toward Wanda.</p><p>Then Rio.</p><p>Both women gave him a small nod.</p><p>So, he spoke.</p><p>“My foster father caught me kissing a boy.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The air in the courtroom was thick, suffocating.</p><p>“He dragged me inside,” Billy continued, his voice smaller now. “Said he was gonna ‘fix me.’”</p><p>His hands were shaking.</p><p>“He hit me. Over and over. I got away.”</p><p>A sharp breath ripped from Wanda.</p><p>Billy’s eyes burned, but he refused to cry.</p><p>“I found Rio’s number,” he said. “She’s the only person I had. So I ran.”</p><p>His voice dropped lower.</p><p>“I would’ve rather died on the street than gone back.”</p><p>The prosecutor let the silence settle.</p><p>Then, he reached for a document.</p><p>“Billy, do you recognize this?”</p><p>Billy glanced down.</p><p>It was a file. A donation list.</p><p>Money that had gone straight to his last foster home.</p><p>Billy’s stomach twisted.</p><p>“…What is this?”</p><p>The prosecutor lifted his gaze.</p><p>“It’s a list of private donors,” he said. “People who contributed to keep that home open.”</p><p>Billy felt cold.</p><p>The prosecutor turned the document, showing a bold, familiar name.</p><p>Evanora Harkness.</p><p>Billy’s pulse roared in his ears.</p><p>“…She funded them?” he whispered.</p><p>The prosecutor nodded.</p><p>Billy’s breath hitched.</p><p>“She helped pay for that place?”</p><p>More than that.</p><p>She helped keep it running.</p><p>Evanora’s lead attorney stood, adjusting his tie.</p><p>“Billy,” he began, voice smooth, practiced.</p><p>Billy’s stomach twisted.</p><p>The lawyer smiled. “You seem like a very passionate young man.”</p><p>Billy said nothing.</p><p>The lawyer tilted his head. “But tell me… wouldn’t you say that, perhaps, your emotions are clouding your judgment?”</p><p>Billy’s jaw locked.</p><p>“My judgment?” he echoed.</p><p>The lawyer nodded.</p><p>“You’re sixteen,” he said, like that explained everything. “Surely, at your age, your perception of events can be a little… dramatic.”</p><p>Billy stared.</p><p>Then, he did something that took everyone by surprise.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>It was cold. Sharp.</p><p>He leaned forward slightly.</p><p>“I’m sorry, did I imagine getting my ribs broken?”</p><p>The lawyer hesitated.</p><p>Billy’s smirk didn’t waver.</p><p>“Did I imagine being locked outside all night in winter?” he continued, voice mocking. “Or did I imagine my foster dad calling me a f—”</p><p>Agatha stood sharply. “Billy.”</p><p>Billy exhaled through his nose.</p><p>Then, he leaned back, jaw clenched.</p><p>The lawyer sighed dramatically.</p><p>“Billy,” he tried again, “perhaps—”</p><p>Billy cut him off.</p><p>“No. You don’t get to talk.”</p><p>The jury visibly reacted.</p><p>The lawyer flushed. “I—”</p><p>Billy turned, finally locking onto Evanora.</p><p>His expression was calm, quiet.</p><p>“You did this.”</p><p>Evanora’s face remained unreadable.</p><p>Billy tilted his head.</p><p>“You funded them,” he said, his voice steel. “You paid the people who hurt me.

The reminder of everything she had endured.</p><p>She walked toward the witness stand, her movements slow, deliberate.</p><p>Every eye was on her.</p><p>She didn’t care.</p><p>Rio settled into the chair, adjusting the microphone. She felt Agatha’s gaze on her, her presence solid and grounding.</p><p>Across the room, Evanora sat poised, unreadable.</p><p>But Rio wasn’t intimidated.</p><p>Because today?</p><p>Evanora wasn’t in control.</p><p>The prosecutor stepped forward, his voice steady.</p><p>“Please state your name and occupation for the court.”</p><p>Rio licked her lips. “Rio Vidal. I’m a journalism student, interning at <em>The Post.</em>”</p><p>The prosecutor nodded. “Miss Vidal, I understand you have personal knowledge of Evanora Harkness’s operations. Can you walk us through how you became involved in this case?”</p><p>Rio shifted slightly, folding her hands in her lap.</p><p>“I met Agatha Harkness when we became roommates,” she began. “I didn’t know anything about her mother or what she had done. At first, I just thought I was stuck with a pain in the ass law student who hated how messy I was.”</p><p>A small ripple of amusement passed through the courtroom.</p><p>Agatha smirked slightly.</p><p>Rio’s expression sobered.</p><p>“But then, things started happening,” she said. “Letters. Threats. We found out that Agatha’s mother was involved in things—horrible things.”</p><p>Her voice dropped.</p><p>“And we started digging.”</p><p>The prosecutor nodded. “And what did you find?”</p><p>Rio inhaled deeply.</p><p>“Corruption,” she said. “So much corruption. From the legal system, to the courts, to entire businesses being controlled from the shadows. We followed a money trail that led straight to Evanora Harkness.”</p><p>Her voice hardened.</p><p>“She’s not just a corrupt businesswoman. She’s a predator. She builds people up just to tear them down. She silences people who get in her way. She buys out anyone who can be bought. And those who can’t?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched.</p><p>“They disappear.”</p><p>The jury visibly stiffened.</p><p>The prosecutor let the words sink in.</p><p>Then, he pressed forward.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The prosecutor flipped a page in his notes once again.</p><p>“Miss Vidal,” he said, his voice quieter now, careful. “Can you describe what happened the night of your stabbing?”</p><p>The room grew even quieter.</p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s gaze on her. Felt Wanda’s tension from across the room.</p><p>She exhaled slowly, pressing her palms against the cool surface of the witness stand.</p><p>“I wasn’t the target,” she said, voice steady but low.</p><p>The jury shifted slightly.</p><p>The prosecutor leaned forward. “Then who was?”</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha for half a second.</p><p>Then back at the prosecutor.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>A collective murmur rippled through the courtroom.</p><p>The judge banged the gavel. “Silence.”</p><p>The prosecutor let the reaction settle before pressing forward.</p><p>“Miss Vidal, can you walk the court through what happened?”</p><p>Rio’s fingers curled tightly into her lap.</p><p>She forced herself to relive it.</p><p>“It was late,” Rio began. “Agatha was walking home from the library. I was out, just coming back from… from a party.”</p><p>She let out a small, humorless chuckle.</p><p>“I don’t even remember why I was out that night. But if I hadn’t been—”</p><p>She cut herself off.</p><p>Took a breath.</p><p>“I saw him first,” she continued. “A man, waiting. I knew something was wrong the second I saw him.”</p><p>She clenched her fists.</p><p>“I saw him grab Agatha. She tried to fight, but he had a knife. He wanted her bag, but that wasn’t it—he wanted to hurt her.”</p><p>Rio’s voice hardened.</p><p>“I didn’t think. I just—ran.”</p><p>Her heartbeat pounded in her ears.</p><p>“I faced him. Got the knife away from Agatha.”</p><p>She exhaled shakily.</p><p>“And then… I felt it.”</p><p>She touched her side absently, where the stitches had once been.</p><p>“I didn’t even realize I got stabbed at first.”</p><p>Her throat tightened.</p><p>“I just remember Agatha screaming.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands curled into fists on the table.</p><p>“She caught me before I hit the ground,” Rio continued, her voice quieter. “Held me. Called for help.”</p><p>Her jaw clenched.</p><p>“I remember thinking I was going to die in her arms.”</p><p>The jury was stiff, unmoving.</p><p>The prosecutor let the silence stretch before he asked, “Do you believe that this was just a random attack?”</p><p>Rio snorted.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>She turned, looking directly at Evanora.</p><p>“I believe it was a message.”</p><p>Evanora’s expression didn’t change.</p><p>But Rio saw it.</p><p>The smallest flicker of something.</p><p>She turned back to the jury.</p><p>“She went after Agatha. And when I got in the way, she didn’t care. She let me bleed.”</p><p>Rio paused.</p><p>Her voice softened, almost bitter.</p><p>“I don’t know how many other people she’s let bleed.”</p><p>Evanora’s lawyer stood, adjusting his tie.</p><p>“Miss Vidal, that was quite a story.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow. “You think I made it up?”</p><p>The lawyer chuckled. “Not at all. But perhaps you’re… embellishing.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, mocking.</p><p>“Oh, I see. I only got a little bit stabbed?”</p><p>The jury shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>The lawyer’s lips twitched.</p><p>“I only mean to suggest,” he said, feigning politeness, “that perhaps your emotions are clouding your recollection.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened.</p><p>“You weren’t there.”</p><p>She leaned forward slightly.</p><p>“You didn’t hear Agatha’s voice when she thought I was dying.”</p><p>Her voice turned sharp.</p><p>“You didn’t see the blood on her hands. And it wasn’t just once. I have more than enough healing wounds.”</p><p>The lawyer faltered, just for a second.</p><p>The jury wasn’t looking at him.</p><p>They were looking at Evanora.</p><p>Rio sat back, crossing her arms.</p><p>“You can try to spin this any way you want,” she said. “But we all know the truth.”</p><p>She turned her head, locking eyes with Evanora one last time.</p><p>“You never meant to kill me.”</p><p>Her voice dropped lower.</p><p>“But you would’ve let me die anyway.”</p><p>Evanora’s expression remained unreadable.</p><p>But Rio knew.</p><p>She had struck a nerve.</p><p>And for the first time since this war started—</p><p>She had the upper hand.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The prosecutor didn’t wait.</p><p>As Rio settled back, recovering from her last answer, he stepped forward, flipping a page in his notes.</p><p>“Miss Vidal, just days ago, you were attacked again—this time, shot. Can you describe what happened?”</p><p>Agatha visibly tensed.</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly.</p><p>She was still recovering.</p><p>Her body ached, her movements were slower than usual.</p><p>But she was here.</p><p>And she was going to finish this.</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “It was supposed to be a normal day. We had finally moved forward with our investigation, and we were working at Wanda’s house. Everyone was feeling… relieved. Our plan was working and soon enough everything would be out in the open for the world to see.”</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>“We let our guard down.”</p><p>Her voice dropped lower.</p><p>“Evanora and her team found us and attacked us. She tried to kill Agatha…”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched.</p><p>“I heard it before I felt it.”</p><p>The courtroom stilled.</p><p>“A crack. A gunshot.”</p><p>Her fingers twitched against the stand.</p><p>“Then… pain.”</p><p>Agatha looked down, her face unreadable, but Rio knew.</p><p>She was reliving it too.</p><p>“I didn’t even know where it hit me at first. I just—fell.”</p><p>Her throat tightened.</p><p>“I remember the ground being cold.”</p><p>She exhaled.</p><p>“Then I heard voices. Screaming.”</p><p>She looked at Agatha.</p><p>“And then I saw her.”</p><p>Her voice dropped lower.</p><p>“She was covered in my blood. Holding me. Begging me to stay.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled into fists.</p><p>The jury was horrified.</p><p>The prosecutor let the silence stretch before asking, “Do you believe this was another attempt to silence you?”</p><p>Rio laughed softly.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>She turned to the jury.</p><p>“You all see it, don’t you?” she asked, voice sharp.</p><p>“This woman doesn’t stop. She doesn’t care who she hurts. And if we don’t stop her, she’ll keep doing it.”</p><p>Evanora’s jaw tightened ever so slightly.</p><p>And Rio noticed.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Evanora’s lead attorney stood, smoothing his tie.</p><p>His calm expression was nothing but a mask. Beneath it, he was a viper, coiling to strike.</p><p>He walked slowly toward Rio, flipping open a thick file in his hands.</p><p>“Miss Vidal,” he began, his voice almost sympathetic. “You’ve been through quite a lot, haven’t you?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head.</p><p>“You could say that.”</p><p>The lawyer offered a small smile. “It seems hardship has followed you for most of your life.”</p><p>He turned a page, eyes skimming.</p><p>“Born in a small town, parents deceased when you were barely six years old.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened.</p><p>He flipped another page.</p><p>“Entered foster care shortly after. Moved through… let’s see… twelve different placements in ten years.”</p><p>The jury stiffened.</p><p>He pretended to scan the document with interest.</p><p>“Ah, and here’s where it gets interesting.”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly.</p><p>She knew where this was going.</p><p>“Your records indicate a rather… difficult adjustment period,” he continued. “Quite a number of complaints from foster families.”</p><p>He glanced up at her.</p><p>“Would you like me to read them?”</p><p>Rio stared him down.</p><p>“Why don’t you?” she said coolly.</p><p>The lawyer smiled wider.</p><p>He cleared his throat, reading:</p><p>‘Defiant.

Violent tendencies.’</p><p>He let the words linger.</p><p>The jury absorbed every syllable.</p><p>The lawyer flipped the page.</p><p>“Oh, and this one’s particularly concerning…”</p><p>He turned his gaze back to Rio.</p><p>“Your time in juvenile detention.”</p><p>Agatha visibly tensed.</p><p>Rio’s fingers curled into fists.</p><p>The lawyer sighed dramatically.</p><p>“Breaking and entering. Destruction of property. Resisting arrest.”</p><p>He looked back at the jury.</p><p>“This isn’t speculation. This is documented fact.”</p><p>He flipped another page, shaking his head.</p><p>“And let’s not forget, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this very woman—this witness—broke into my client’s home.”</p><p>The courtroom reacted sharply.</p><p>The judge knocked his gavel. “Order.”</p><p>The lawyer pressed on.</p><p>“Is it possible, Miss Vidal, that you have a… pattern? That perhaps your claims against my client are nothing more than the latest in a long line of reckless, attention-seeking behaviors?”</p><p>Rio felt the anger rising.</p><p>She glanced toward Agatha, toward Wanda, toward Alice—</p><p>All of them were seething.</p><p>But they couldn’t do anything.</p><p>This was her fight.</p><p>The lawyer leaned forward slightly, voice softer now.</p><p>“Miss Vidal, would you say you enjoy being the center of attention?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw locked.</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>He smirked.</p><p>“Well, it would seem, based on your history, that you have a knack for… finding trouble. And when you do, you certainly seem to find people willing to fight for you.”</p><p>Rio stared, unblinking.</p><p>The lawyer gestured toward Agatha.</p><p>“First your roommate—now your lover—jumps in to save you.”</p><p>Then he gestured toward Wanda.</p><p>“Another woman fights for you, willing to break the law on your behalf.”</p><p>Then toward Alice.</p><p>“Even your friend—willing to nearly die for your cause.”</p><p>He tilted his head.</p><p>“Wouldn’t you say, Miss Vidal, that this seems to be a… pattern?”</p><p>Rio’s heart pounded.</p><p>He smirked, pressing one last time.</p><p>“Tell me, Miss Vidal, do you get a thrill from watching people go to war for you?”</p><p>The courtroom was suffocatingly silent.</p><p>Rio’s fingers dug into her chair.</p><p>Her mind was screaming.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Rio exhaled.</p><p>Then, she laughed.</p><p>It was sharp, bitter, deadly.</p><p>The lawyer’s smile faltered.</p><p>Rio leaned forward, voice low and cutting.</p><p>“You wanna know the real pattern?”</p><p>She stared him down.</p><p>“People like you underestimate me.”</p><p>Her voice was razor-sharp.</p><p>“You see someone who came from nothing, someone who had to fight for every single inch of her life, and you think that makes me weak.”</p><p>Her nails dug into the wood of the witness stand.</p><p>“You wanna bring up my past? Go ahead. I’ve got nothing to hide.”</p><p>Her eyes burned.</p><p>“I was a kid. A kid who was abandoned. A kid no one taught how to fit into your perfect little system. A kid who had to learn the hard way that the only person who was gonna save me was me.”</p><p>The jury was hooked.</p><p>The lawyer tensed.</p><p>Rio leaned in, never breaking eye contact.</p><p>“You think I like being in danger?” she asked, voice soft but dangerous.</p><p>“I think I’ve been fighting for my life since I was six years old.”</p><p>Her jaw tightened.</p><p>“And if you think for one second that I did all of this just to ‘get attention,’ then you’re even more pathetic than I thought.”</p><p>She sat back, arms crossed.</p><p>“So go ahead. Keep trying to paint me as some manipulative little brat who gets off on people protecting her.”</p><p>Her gaze turned ice-cold.</p><p>“But let me remind you—I’m the one who took the knife.”</p><p>A hush fell over the courtroom.</p><p>The lawyer’s smirk vanished.</p><p>The jury took note.</p><p>Rio grinned.</p><p>“You just lost.”</p><p>As Rio stepped down from the stand, she didn’t look at the lawyer.</p><p>Didn’t look at the jury.</p><p>She only looked at Evanora.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The courtroom doors creaked open once more.</p><p>The bailiff’s voice rang out with crisp finality:<br/>“Miss Agatha Harkness, please take the stand.”</p><p>There was a shift in the air.</p><p>Not dramatic. Not loud.<br/>But heavy. Focused.</p><p>Agatha rose from her seat with the same grace and precision she brought to everything—her spine straight, her jaw tight, her steps measured and composed.</p><p>She passed Rio on her way to the stand. Didn’t look at her. Didn’t need to.<br/>Rio was already watching her.<br/>Like she always did.</p><p>Agatha sat down, adjusted the microphone, and folded her hands tightly in her lap.</p><p>The prosecutor stepped forward.</p><p>“Please state your name and occupation for the court.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was even. Controlled. But there was an edge under it. A tension pulled too tight.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness. I’m a law student and a former resident advisor.”</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>And then—</p><p>“I was also Evanora Harkness’s daughter.”</p><p>A stir. Not from the jury—but the gallery.</p><p>Evanora didn’t flinch. But the lack of expression was a tell in itself.</p><p>The prosecutor gave Agatha space to speak, stepping back.</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly.</p><p>“I want to make something very clear,” she began, voice calm but razor-sharp. “I didn’t come here to defend my life choices. I didn’t come here to talk about my grades or how early I wake up or how many rules I follow. I came here because I need you to understand <em>exactly</em> what kind of person Evanora Harkness is. And what she has done.”</p><p>Her gaze swept across the room.</p><p>“When I was younger, people used to say I was lucky. That I had a brilliant, successful mother. A woman who wore tailored suits and ran million-dollar businesses. They said she was strong. Smart. Ruthless, yes—but always composed. The kind of woman other women wanted to be.”</p><p>Her lip curled. The first break in her composure.</p><p>“But none of them saw what I saw.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“I didn’t know at first. I thought… maybe she was just strict. That she expected excellence. But over time, I started noticing things. The silences. The buried documents. The calls at three in the morning. People who used to be in her orbit vanishing overnight.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice dropped slightly.</p><p>“And then came the threats. The warnings. The whispered ‘you’re just like her’ from people who didn’t mean it as a compliment.”</p><p>She tightened her hands in her lap.</p><p>“I tried to get out. I worked. I got scholarships. I moved into that apartment to be away from her. To be <em>myself</em>. To breathe.”</p><p>A brief glance toward Rio.</p><p>“And then, she followed me.”</p><p>The courtroom was still.</p><p>“I didn’t know it at first. Not until Rio moved in. Not until strange things started happening. Letters. Emails. Students turning cold overnight. Professors mysteriously dropping support. Doors closing around me. And Rio—” her voice caught, just slightly. “—Rio got dragged into it.”</p><p>She shook her head once.</p><p>“She didn’t ask for any of it. She just wanted to go to class, write her articles, leave coffee mugs everywhere. But she stayed. She stayed even when the threats turned physical. Even when the attacks came.”</p><p>The jury was unmoving.</p><p>Agatha’s next words were quieter. But no less sharp.</p><p>“She took a knife for me. And then she took a bullet. And I—”</p><p>She faltered. Her throat worked silently for a second.<br/>But she didn’t cry.</p><p>“I held her while she bled out on a tiled floor. I screamed for help. I pressed my hands to her side and told her to stay awake, told her she was going to be okay, even though I didn’t believe it.”</p><p>She looked directly at the jury now.</p><p>“Do you know what it’s like to see the person you love dying in your arms?”</p><p>A ripple. A hand to a mouth. A breath drawn in too sharp.</p><p>“Because I do. More than once.”</p><p>She looked down at her hands, then back up.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness did this. She orchestrated every part of it. She used fear the way most people use ink. She forged power through silence, not strength. She made sure no one would believe me—because I was her daughter. Because if I turned against her, I had to be ungrateful. Or emotional. Or lying.”</p><p>She leaned forward, voice cutting through the stillness.</p><p>“But I am not lying.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice turned colder now. More resolute.</p><p>“She has buried people. She has threatened families. She has used children as leverage. She paid off entire departments. Bought silence with blood money. And when that didn’t work—she sent people to shut us up.”</p><p>She turned to the defense table. To Evanora.</p><p>And for the first time—Agatha let herself look at her.</p><p>“She tried to have me killed.”</p><p>The words landed like stone.</p><p>“I’m not saying that lightly. She didn’t point the gun herself. She never would. That’s not her style. She whispers. She manipulates. She gets others to do her dirty work.”</p><p>She faced the jury again.</p><p>“She didn’t care that Rio was in the way. She didn’t care if I ended up six feet under. All she cared about was that I stopped asking questions.”</p><p>Another pause.</p><p>And then—calmer. But no less intense:</p><p>“She thinks that because she’s smart, because she’s rich, because she built this empire from the shadows, that no one will ever touch her.”</p><p>Agatha drew in a breath. Her hands unclenched.</p><p>“Well, here we are.”</p><p>The silence stretched.</p><p>Agatha’s voice, when it came again, was softer. More raw.</p><p>“You can call me a control freak. You can call me stubborn. Cold. But I’m not afraid to tell the truth. And I’m not afraid of her anymore.”</p><p>She rose slowly, voice unwavering.</p><p>“She broke me. And I rebuilt. With help. With pain. With blood I can still see in my nightmares.”</p><p>She looked at Rio for the first time since sitting down.</p><p>And then back to the jury.</p><p>“Don’t let her do it again.”</p><p>She stepped down.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The tension hadn’t even settled by the time Evanora’s lead attorney rose from his chair.</p><p>He adjusted his cuffs like it was part of the performance.</p><p>“Miss Harkness,” he began, voice syrup-smooth. “Thank you for your… passionate testimony.”</p><p>Agatha remained seated, spine straight, hands folded.</p><p>He stepped forward slowly.</p><p>“I’d like to ask you a few questions. Just to clarify a few points for the jury.”</p><p>She didn’t blink. “Of course.”</p><p>He smiled, almost too warmly.</p><p>“You mentioned that your mother—Evanora Harkness—was strict. That she had high expectations. That she was powerful.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once. “Yes.”</p><p>“And that you struggled under that, didn’t you?”</p><p>A flicker in her eyes. “I wouldn’t say <em>struggled.</em> I’d say I learned how to survive her.”</p><p>The lawyer tilted his head, smile fixed. “That’s quite an accusation. ‘Survive.’ But isn’t it true that your mother provided for you? Paid your tuition? Gave you a place to live?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened slightly. “She did. And then she used those things as leverage to control me.”</p><p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“And what proof do you have of that? Voicemails? Emails? Signed contracts of coercion?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch. “You don’t need to put a collar on someone to choke them. Sometimes, all it takes is silence. Or a look. Or the withdrawal of a single word.”</p><p>A ripple through the jury.</p><p>The lawyer pressed on, voice still calm but colder now.</p><p>“Miss Harkness, would you say your relationship with your mother was…complicated?”</p><p>Agatha smirked faintly. “I’d say it was a slow-burn psychological horror story. But sure. Let’s call it complicated.”</p><p>A few jurors reacted—half amusement, half disbelief.</p><p>The lawyer’s smile thinned.</p><p>“And is it possible, then, that some of your claims today—your certainty that your mother wanted you dead, for instance—might be colored by resentment?”</p><p>Agatha cocked her head. “You think I imagined a knife to my throat and a bullet in my girlfriend’s chest because Mommy didn’t say ‘I love you’ enough?”</p><p>He ignored the bite in her tone.</p><p>“Miss Harkness, I’m simply suggesting that perhaps you and Miss Vidal were already on edge. That you’ve both been through a great deal. That perhaps… emotions are blurring reality.”</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a moment.</p><p>Then:</p><p>“Is that how you justify it to yourself? That women like me—like Rio—are just emotional?”</p><p>Her voice was soft. But lethal.</p><p>He blinked. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Agatha leaned forward, calm and cold.</p><p>“You’ve spent this whole trial trying to paint Rio as hysterical. As volatile. And now you’re trying it with me. Tell me—does that playbook <em>ever</em> work, or are you just hoping the jury’s too tired to notice?”</p><p>There was a quiet gasp.<br/>One juror nodded, just barely.</p><p>The lawyer straightened, his smile cracking ever so slightly.</p><p>“Let’s… refocus. You say your mother orchestrated these attacks. Can you name a single person who will testify to being directly ordered by her to do so?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said. “Because the people she orders? They don’t talk. Or they don’t survive long enough to try.”</p><p>“And yet you have no hard proof.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice sharpened. “I have a bullet hole in my door. I have surveillance footage of a man stalking me for weeks before Rio was stabbed. I have medical bills, restraining orders, and a city of whispers.”</p><p>She looked the lawyer dead in the eye.</p><p>“And I have the truth. Which, judging by how fast you’re sweating, is more than you can say.”</p><p>Laughter threatened in the gallery—but the judge banged the gavel.</p><p>“Order. Ms. Harkness, everyone—watch yourselves.”</p><p>Agatha sat back.</p><p>Unshaken.</p><p>The lawyer stepped away, his smile gone now. His notes forgotten.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The judge adjusted their glasses. The bailiff shifted his weight. And then—</p><p>“Evanora Harkness, please take the stand.”</p><p>The name alone seemed to chill the room.<br/>It was a name that had sat in everyone’s mouths for weeks now—spoken with fear, suspicion, anger.</p><p>And now she stood.</p><p>Poised. Elegant. Unbothered.</p><p>Evanora Harkness moved like she wasn’t entering a courtroom. She moved like she owned it.</p><p>Her heels echoed with quiet authority against the wood floor. A tailored suit clung perfectly to her frame. Silver at her temples. Eyes that didn’t waver.</p><p>She sat down slowly. Deliberately.</p><p>Adjusted the microphone with the grace of someone who had done this before.</p><p>Her lawyer rose from his seat like he had rehearsed every breath.</p><p>“Please state your name and occupation for the court,” he said.</p><p>Evanora tilted her chin ever so slightly.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness. CEO and Chairwoman of the Harkness Foundation. I sit on four corporate boards. I’m also a consultant in legal reform and urban redevelopment initiatives. And, of course—Agatha Harkness is my daughter.”</p><p>The last line hung in the air.</p><p>Across the room, Agatha did not react.</p><p>Rio’s jaw locked, her fingers white-knuckling the edge of her seat.</p><p>The lawyer stepped closer.</p><p>“Miss Harkness, there have been… severe allegations levied against you throughout this trial. Are you prepared to address them?”</p><p>Evanora smiled.</p><p>A small, polished, immaculate smile.</p><p>“I find it curious,” she said, voice smooth as glass, “that protecting one’s legacy and preserving a lifetime of work now qualifies as ‘corruption.’”</p><p>The lawyer nodded. “Let’s start with that, then. Are you denying the accusations made by Miss Vidal, the rest of the witnesses and your daughter?”</p><p>“I’m not denying that they believe what they’re saying,” Evanora replied. “But belief is not truth. Emotion is not evidence. And sentiment—however theatrical—should never replace fact.”</p><p>She looked directly at the jury.</p><p>“It is easy,” she said, “to create villains when you are desperate to feel righteous.”</p><p>A few jurors stirred.</p><p>Her lawyer nodded. “Let’s talk about the events surrounding Miss Vidal’s stabbing. Were you involved in any way?”</p><p>“Of course not,” Evanora said smoothly. “And frankly, the suggestion that I orchestrated a street attack on my own daughter and her roommate is not only absurd—it’s offensive.”</p><p>Rio’s fists curled in her lap.</p><p>The lawyer continued. “And what of the more recent shooting? Were you involved?”</p><p>Evanora’s voice didn’t even waver.</p><p>“I was in a business meeting across the city. I have alibis. Security footage. Testimonies from board members. I’m sure the prosecution is aware.”</p><p>There was a calm confidence in her words.</p><p>Too calm.</p><p>“And these supposed conspiracies against Miss Harkness—your daughter,” the lawyer prompted, “what do you say to those?”</p><p>Evanora finally looked toward Agatha.</p><p>There was no warmth in her gaze. Only calculation.</p><p>“I say that I love my daughter,” she said carefully. “And I deeply regret the choices that led her to turn against her own blood.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t move. Didn’t speak. But her jaw tightened.</p><p>“I have supported her for years,” Evanora continued. “Academically. Financially. I have ensured her safety, her education, her future. If anything, I am guilty of caring too much.”</p><p>She glanced back at the jury.</p><p>“I was not perfect. I demanded discipline. Excellence. Integrity. But I was not abusive. I was not cruel. And I certainly did not attempt to have my daughter—or her girlfriend—murdered.”</p><p>She let that last word hang.</p><p>Gently twisted.</p><p>The lawyer paused, letting her words land.</p><p>Then—</p><p>“Miss Harkness,” he said, “why do you think these accusations have come to light now?”</p><p>Evanora folded her hands. Perfectly aligned.</p><p>“Because,” she said, “when children stop seeing their parents as gods, they often make devils of them instead.”</p><p>The room was frozen.</p><p>“And Rio Vidal?” the lawyer asked. “What do you make of her influence over your daughter?”</p><p>Evanora tilted her head ever so slightly.</p><p>“Miss Vidal is magnetic. Messy. She thrives on disruption and conflict. And Agatha, for all her strength, has always been drawn to storms. She doesn’t realize the damage until it’s already done.”</p><p>Across the courtroom, Rio scoffed under her breath.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even blink.</p><p>The lawyer closed his file.</p><p>“No further questions, Your Honor.”</p><p>The judge turned to the prosecution.</p><p>“Cross-examination?”</p><p>The prosecutor stood, slow and steady.</p><p>“Yes, Your Honor. We have questions.”</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The prosecutor approached the stand slowly, hands folded behind his back, his voice calm but deliberate.</p><p>“Miss Harkness,” he began, “you stated earlier that you have provided for your daughter for many years.”</p><p>Evanora didn’t flinch. “I have.”</p><p>“You also stated that you were not involved in the assault of Miss Vidal or the attempted shooting of your daughter.”</p><p>“That is correct.”</p><p>The prosecutor nodded, flipping to a page in his binder.</p><p>“Let’s talk about that support for a moment.” He glanced up. “According to the records, you revoked your financial contributions to Miss Harkness’s tuition nearly three months before the attacks began.”</p><p>Evanora smiled thinly. “Agatha insisted on independence. I respected her choice.”</p><p>“Respected it,” the prosecutor repeated. “Or punished it?”</p><p>There was a faint ripple in the jury.</p><p>Evanora’s smile didn’t waver. “I would never punish my daughter for growing up.”</p><p>The prosecutor didn’t blink.</p><p>“No?” He turned a page. “Then why did you contact three of her professors within the same week to express… ‘concerns about her academic stability’?”</p><p>The courtroom stirred.</p><p>Evanora’s jaw twitched, but she recovered quickly. “As any concerned parent would. My daughter was clearly under undue stress. She had surrounded herself with unpredictable influences.”</p><p>The prosecutor stepped closer. “Unpredictable like Rio Vidal?”</p><p>“Yes,” Evanora replied. “Exactly.”</p><p>He didn’t miss a beat.</p><p>“Funny. Because you also paid a private investigator to follow Rio Vidal for weeks. Is that part of being a concerned parent?”</p><p>The temperature dropped.</p><p>Evanora’s fingers tightened ever so slightly around the edge of the stand. “I hired someone to ensure my daughter’s safety. Miss Vidal is a volatile young woman with a criminal record.”</p><p>The prosecutor raised an eyebrow. “Did you ever tell your daughter that someone was following her roommate?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Evanora’s voice was quieter. “She was already under too much pressure.”</p><p>“And yet you claim you were protecting her?”</p><p>“I was,” she snapped.</p><p>The first crack.</p><p>The prosecutor stepped back slightly.</p><p>“You see, Miss Harkness, that’s the problem. You say you were protecting her. But your version of ‘protection’ involves surveillance. Intimidation. Control.”</p><p>He let the word settle.</p><p>“Let’s talk about control.”</p><p>He picked up another document and held it up.</p><p>“This is a bank statement tied to one of your shell companies. Ring any bells? Sable &amp; Wren Enterprises?”</p><p>Evanora said nothing.</p><p>The prosecutor turned to the jury.</p><p>“This company, ladies and gentlemen, made two very large, very sudden cash transfers to men who have since been connected to the attacks on both Miss Vidal and Miss Harkness.”</p><p>He turned back to Evanora.</p><p>“Care to explain that?”</p><p>Evanora’s lips were pale. “I don’t handle every financial detail—”</p><p>“You authorized the transfers.”</p><p>He held up another document. “Your signature. Dated four days before the first attack.”</p><p>Evanora’s voice turned sharp. “Those were routine payouts.”</p><p>“To unregistered individuals with no employment record? Paid in cash?”</p><p>He took a step closer.</p><p>“Or should we just call them what they are—contracted enforcers?”</p><p>The jury stiffened. A few gasped.</p><p>Evanora’s mouth opened. Closed. Her facade flickered.</p><p>“You’re twisting this,” she said coldly. “I have no knowledge of—”</p><p>The prosecutor cut in, steel in his voice now.</p><p>“Miss Harkness, how long have you been running your empire from the shadows? How many times have you crushed dissent by making it disappear? How many people—”</p><p>“I protected what I built,” Evanora snapped, louder than before.</p><p>There it was.</p><p>Silence fell like a hammer.</p><p>The prosecutor let the moment stretch before he asked, softly:</p><p>“And what exactly were you protecting it <em>from</em>?”</p><p>Evanora’s eyes flicked—just for a second—toward her daughter.</p><p>And for the first time, her voice broke just slightly.</p><p>“From being taken by people who didn’t understand what it cost to build.”</p><p>The prosecutor stepped back, satisfied.</p><p>“No further questions.”</p><p>He returned to his table. The judge called for a brief recess.</p><p>But Evanora didn’t move.</p><p>And neither did Agatha.</p><p>For a moment, it was just the two of them, across the courtroom.</p><p>Mother and daughter.</p><p>Neither willing to look away.</p><p>Neither willing to speak first.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The courtroom emptied slowly, a hush still clinging to everyone’s shoulders.</p><p>Rio stood just outside the double doors, leaning heavily against the wall. Her body still ached from the last attack—she moved like she’d aged years in the past month. But her eyes were sharp, alert, locked on the door Evanora had exited through minutes before.</p><p>A beat later, Agatha joined her.</p><p>Neither said anything at first.</p><p>Rio’s arms were folded. Agatha’s jaw was clenched tight.</p><p>“You good?” Rio asked softly, voice low.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. Her gaze was distant—focused on something far away. Or maybe something deep inside.</p><p>“She looked at me,” Agatha murmured. “When they asked her what she was protecting it from. She looked <em>at me.</em>”</p><p>Rio reached for her hand.</p><p>Agatha let her take it.</p><p>“She always blamed me,” Agatha whispered. “For being too loud. Too stubborn. Too much like my father. For leaving. For not being moldable enough.”</p><p>Rio nodded once. “And now she blames you for standing.”</p><p>They stood there for a moment—fingers locked, pulse steadying.</p><p>“She cracked,” Rio said. “You saw it. They saw it.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled. “Not enough. People like her don’t get taken down by cracks. You have to take the whole facade apart.”</p><p>“We just did,” Rio said. “You’re still breathing, counselor.”</p><p>Agatha gave her the faintest smile.</p><p>“I don’t want to lose,” she whispered. “I want her to <em>answer</em>.”</p><p>“You won’t lose,” Rio said. “Not this time.”</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The prosecutor stood at the center of the courtroom, hands clasped behind his back. He didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t pace.</p><p>He simply <em>spoke</em>.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness built an empire. No one is denying that. She is smart. Strategic. Powerful. But none of that justifies what she has done.”</p><p>He gestured to the jury.</p><p>“You’ve heard the testimonies. You’ve seen the evidence. This isn’t just about a powerful woman making tough calls. This is about a calculated web of manipulation, coercion, and violence. One that spanned institutions, silenced victims, and nearly cost two young women their lives.”</p><p>He paused, eyes landing on Agatha. Then Rio.</p><p>“They fought to be heard. And when that didn’t work, they bled to prove it.”</p><p>A silence fell again.</p><p>“Don’t let power excuse cruelty. Don’t let wealth rewrite the story. And don’t let fear win.”</p><p>He nodded once.</p><p>“We ask that you find Evanora Harkness guilty on all counts.”</p><p>He returned to his seat.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Evanora’s lawyer rose slowly.</p><p>He gave the jury a tired, almost regretful smile.</p><p>“I won’t stand here and pretend Evanora Harkness is soft. She’s not. She’s demanding. She’s unrelenting. And yes, she’s made enemies. But so do all great leaders.”</p><p>He spread his arms slightly.</p><p>“What we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is a family unraveling. A daughter seeking distance. A passionate partner looking for justice. But passion doesn’t make a person guilty. Pain doesn’t always mean persecution.”</p><p>He leaned on the railing in front of the jury.</p><p>“Do not let your emotions—however understandable—replace facts.”</p><p>He turned back.</p><p>“We ask that you see the difference between a strict parent and a criminal mastermind. And that you judge accordingly.”</p><p>He sat.</p><p>The Judge stood.</p><p>“You have heard all testimony and closing arguments. The jury will now be sequestered for deliberation.”</p><p>A bang of the gavel.</p><p>“Court is adjourned until the jury returns with a verdict.”</p><p>The courtroom emptied again.</p><p>And all that remained…</p><p>…was waiting.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The waiting room was too quiet.</p><p>Too clean.</p><p>The kind of space meant to keep emotions from spilling out—a sterile in-between. But for Agatha, Rio, Wanda, and Alice, Billy it might as well have been purgatory.</p><p>Wanda sat in the corner, legs bouncing restlessly, eyes darting to her phone even though she knew it wouldn't ring. Alice paced—small, tight circles, arms crossed so hard it looked like she was holding herself together.</p><p>Rio had her head leaned back against the wall, eyes half-lidded, exhausted from sleeplessness, blood loss, who knew, a jacket draped over her like a blanket. Her fingers tapped against her knee in a rhythm she probably didn’t realize.</p><p>And Agatha stood.</p><p>Just stood.</p><p>In front of the window, watching the rain hit the glass like it was trying to get in.</p><p>“How long do deliberations usually take?” Alice asked no one in particular.</p><p>Wanda shrugged. “Could be hours. Could be days.”</p><p>“Cool,” Rio muttered. “Can’t wait to sit here long enough to re-feel every single stab wound.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled softly, but it was hollow.</p><p>Alice stopped pacing for a second. “What if she walks?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Agatha didn’t turn from the window.</p><p>“She won’t.”</p><p>Alice hesitated. “You can’t know that.”</p><p>“I can,” Agatha said, voice calm. “Because if she does, I’ll find another way to bring her down.”</p><p>Rio looked over at her. “Please don’t say that like you’ve already mapped it out.”</p><p>Agatha said nothing.</p><p>But she didn’t deny it.</p><p>Wanda stood and walked over to the coffee machine, filled two paper cups, handed one to Rio, one to Alice. She didn’t offer one to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha wouldn’t have taken it anyway.</p><p>“You did good,” Rio said finally.</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders tensed.</p><p>Rio tried again. “You didn’t just testify. You <em>told the truth.</em> You didn’t hide. You let them see her for what she really is.”</p><p>Agatha finally turned.</p><p>The look in her eyes was unreadable—but softer than before.</p><p>“I hate waiting,” she murmured.</p><p>“I know,” Rio said. “Me too.”</p><p>Alice looked up. “So what do we do now?”</p><p>Wanda gave a quiet smile.</p><p>“We hope.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked to the hallway.</p><p>Where just beyond those doors, twelve strangers were deciding the shape of their lives.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>The bailiff’s voice cut through the stillness like a blade.</p><p>“The jury has reached a verdict.”</p><p>Everything stopped.</p><p>Wanda dropped her coffee. Alice froze mid-step. Rio’s tapping halted. And Agatha—Agatha didn’t move. Not even a breath.</p><p>They stood as one, moving from the waiting room to the courtroom like ghosts. The gallery had refilled. The reporters, the onlookers, the vultures.</p><p>And Evanora.</p><p>Perfect. Polished. Poised.</p><p>She stood beside her lawyer with an expression carved from stone.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her. Not once.</p><p>The judge entered. The gavel struck wood.</p><p>“Be seated.”</p><p>The jury filed in, each face a study in control. No tells. No leaks. Just the weight of their silence bearing down on the room.</p><p>The judge turned to the foreperson. “Has the jury reached a unanimous verdict?”</p><p>A woman in her fifties stood. Her hands were steady, but her voice had that quiet reverence people reserved for moments like this.</p><p>“We have, Your Honor.”</p><p>“Please read the verdict.”</p><p>She opened the envelope. The sound of paper moving was deafening.</p><p>“In the matter of the State versus Evanora Harkness, on the count of racketeering… we find Evanora Harkness—guilty.”</p><p>No one breathed.</p><p>“On the count of conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon… guilty.”</p><p>Evanora’s lawyer didn’t flinch.</p><p>But she did.</p><p>A muscle twitched near her eye.</p><p>“On the count of attempted murder… guilty.”</p><p>Gasps rippled through the courtroom. The judge banged the gavel, calling for order.</p><p>Agatha’s hands were clasped in her lap, knuckles white.</p><p>Rio looked over, heart hammering.</p><p>And finally—</p><p>“On the count of attempted murder in the second degree, with malicious intent… we find the defendant—guilty.”</p><p>The judge let the noise swell this time.</p><p>The crowd erupted—some in tears, some cheering, some silent in shock.</p><p>Evanora closed her eyes.</p><p>Not a breakdown. Not defeat.</p><p>Just a flicker of realization.</p><p>She had lost.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>Agatha exhaled like she hadn’t breathed in hours. Wanda reached for her hand and squeezed. Alice let out a full-body gasp and immediately started crying.</p><p>And Rio?</p><p>Rio smiled.</p><p>A slow, sharp smile full of steel and salt and justice.</p><p>The judge called for quiet again.</p><p>“Sentencing will be scheduled for next month. This court is adjourned.”</p><p>The gavel fell one last time.</p><p>And with it—so did Evanora.</p><p>As the bailiffs moved in to handcuff her, her expression cracked.</p><p>She looked at Agatha.</p><p>And for once…</p><p>Agatha didn’t look back.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The courthouse doors opened with a hiss, and in an instant—</p><p>They were mobbed.</p><p>The crowd surged forward, a tidal wave of flashing cameras, microphones, and frenzied questions.</p><p>“Agatha! How does it feel knowing your mother’s going to prison?”</p><p>“Miss Vidal, were you expecting a guilty verdict?”</p><p>“Wanda! Wanda Maximoff! Are you planning to press charges after what happened in the warehouse?”</p><p>“Agatha! Is it true you plan to change your last name?”</p><p>The questions flew like arrows, sharp and endless.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She couldn’t. Her breath was caught somewhere in her throat, and for a second, she was back in the courtroom, watching the cuffs click around Evanora’s wrists.</p><p>Rio stepped closer to her, shielding her from the worst of the chaos.</p><p>Wanda lifted a hand. “Back off,” she said, calm but commanding. “Give her space.”</p><p>Alice—dear, furious Alice—took one of the microphones pointed toward Agatha and hurled it into the bushes.</p><p>“Oops,” she muttered. “Slipped.”</p><p>More flashing lights.</p><p>The crowd grew louder.</p><p>A reporter shoved a mic toward Rio. “Miss Vidal, do you have a statement now that the trial is over?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, but this time… she didn’t bristle.</p><p>Instead, she glanced at Agatha.</p><p>Then stepped forward.</p><p>“Yeah. I do.”</p><p>Silence spread like a wave.</p><p>Rio looked directly into the cameras.</p><p>“This isn’t just about one guilty woman,” she said. “It’s about every system she corrupted, every voice she silenced, and every life she thought she could control.”</p><p>Her voice was clear, cutting.</p><p>“For anyone out there who thinks justice is out of reach… it’s not.”</p><p>The cameras zoomed in. Even the loudest reporters quieted.</p><p>Rio’s jaw set.</p><p>“She hurt people I love. Tried to kill people I care about. And she failed. Because we didn’t back down.”</p><p>She nodded toward Agatha, Wanda, Alice.</p><p>“We’re not going anywhere. And we’re not done.”</p><p>Applause broke out from somewhere in the crowd. A few onlookers shouted Rio’s name. Someone tried to chant it. She rolled her eyes and gave a little wave before stepping back.</p><p>The reporters shifted their attention again, pushing toward Agatha.</p><p>“Miss Harkness, do you have anything to say about your mother’s conviction?”</p><p>“Do you plan to keep the Harkness name?”</p><p>“Did you ever know what she was doing?”</p><p>Agatha raised her hand.</p><p>They stopped.</p><p>Her voice was low, even.</p><p>“I have nothing to say about Evanora.”</p><p>The crowd stirred.</p><p>But then she added—</p><p>“I do have something to say about the people who stood beside me.”</p><p>She turned slightly, eyes sweeping over Rio, Wanda, Alice.</p><p>“They saved me. Again and again. From her. From the system. From myself.”</p><p>She exhaled, fingers trembling.</p><p>“And for the first time in a very long time… I feel free.”</p><p>The noise returned all at once.</p><p>Wanda pulled her coat tighter around herself. Alice tugged Agatha by the sleeve.</p><p>“Let’s get out of here,” she muttered. “Before someone tries to interview my <em>dog</em>.”</p><p>Rio laughed.</p><p>They pushed past the press together, through the barricades, into the waiting car. The door slammed shut behind them, and for the first time all day—</p><p>It was quiet.</p><p>No cameras. No shouting. No judgments.</p><p>Just them.</p><p>Breathing.</p><p>Alive.</p>

<p>Five Months Later</p><p>The autumn wind rolled gently through the small, quiet neighborhood, curling red and gold leaves along the sidewalks and catching in the folds of Wanda’s coat as she stepped out of the modest corner café. The warmth of the to-go cup in her hand seeped into her skin, grounding her as she took a moment to just breathe.</p><p>It had been five months since the trial.</p><p>Five months since she stood in that courtroom and watched Evanora Harkness be found guilty on all counts.</p><p>Five months of learning how to live again.</p><p>She turned the corner and smiled.</p><p>Billy was already at the park bench, his legs swinging slightly under him, a worn sketchpad balanced on his knees. His brows furrowed in concentration as he shaded in the wings of some fantasy creature he hadn’t shown her yet.</p><p>“Hey,” Wanda called softly, holding out the cup. “I got your usual.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes lit up instantly. “Oat milk and cinnamon?”</p><p>“You know it.”</p><p>He grinned and took it, his fingers brushing hers briefly. “Thanks, Mom.”</p><p>She sat beside him, watching as he went back to his drawing. There was a time, not long ago, when he would flinch if someone approached too fast. When he’d go completely silent for hours, trapped in memories he couldn’t articulate. But now?</p><p>Now he drew again.</p><p>He laughed again.</p><p>He slept—most nights.</p><p>Wanda looked at him with something between pride and heartbreak. He was healing. Slowly. But so was she.</p><p>“Did your teacher like the story you wrote?” she asked.</p><p>Billy nodded, sipping his drink. “She said it was ‘wildly imaginative and emotionally mature.’” He made a face. “Whatever that means.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled. “It means she’s impressed.”</p><p>There was a long pause. A calm one.</p><p>Billy tilted his head slightly. “Do you ever think about going back?”</p><p>Wanda blinked. “Back where?”</p><p>“To your old life.”</p><p>She exhaled through her nose, thoughtful.</p><p>After the trial, she’d been offered interviews. Positions at every possible firm in the film industry to turn all of this into a movie, a book, a series.</p><p>But Wanda had declined every single offer.</p><p>“No,” she said at last. “I think I’m exactly where I need to be.”</p><p>Billy nodded. He didn’t press.</p><p>They sat in silence for a while longer.</p><p>Eventually, he turned the sketchpad and showed her what he’d been working on.</p><p>It was them—stylized, cartoony, full of magic and motion. Wanda had a swirling cape made of stars. Billy had a crown of fire and a fox sidekick. They were laughing, flying over a city of glass and trees.</p><p>Wanda felt her throat tighten.</p><p>“You like it?” he asked.</p><p>“I love it,” she whispered.</p><p>And she meant it.</p><p>Every word.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>“You’re going to be late.”</p><p>Alice didn’t look up from the mirror as she twisted her hair into a loose bun, securing it with practiced fingers. “We own the company. I can’t be late.”</p><p>From the kitchen, Jen’s voice drifted over with a grin. “Says the woman who rewrote the entire dress code last night because she didn’t like the word <em>business casual</em>.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes and stepped back, examining the outfit again—tailored blazer, black slacks, her favorite boots peeking out from underneath. Sharp, clean, capable.</p><p>She looked like someone who had <em>made it</em>.</p><p>Jen leaned against the doorway, sipping her tea with both hands wrapped around the mug. “You look terrifyingly competent.”</p><p>“Good,” Alice replied. “That’s the brand.”</p><p>She walked past Jen, grabbing her messenger bag off the couch, then paused.</p><p>“Wait. Did you pack the files?”</p><p>Jen reached behind her, pulled a manila folder from under her blouse like a magician. “Already in order. I even color-coded them. You’re welcome.”</p><p>Alice blinked. “You... what?”</p><p>Jen shrugged. “You’re dating a genius.”</p><p>Alice took the folder and kissed her cheek. “I’m dating a menace.”</p><p>“That too.”</p><p>Their apartment was a strange blend of chaos and charm—whiteboards with half-scribbled ideas, stacks of books with bookmarks sticking out at odd angles, and a new espresso machine that Jen insisted on figuring out without instructions.</p><p>Alice glanced at the front page of the folder, heart thudding with something that felt like disbelief wrapped in pride. <em>The Hawthorne Ledger</em>, it read. <em>Independent. Unbought. Unafraid.</em></p><p>Five months ago, they’d exposed one of the most powerful women in the country.</p><p>Now?</p><p>Alice was launching a firm of her own. Investigative reporting. Whistleblower protection. Real journalism, the kind that meant something.</p><p>And Jen?</p><p>Jen had been her anchor through it all.</p><p>Alice turned to her now, softer. “You sure you don’t want to come with me?”</p><p>Jen shook her head. “Not yet. I think today’s your victory lap.”</p><p>Alice opened her mouth to protest, but Jen stepped forward, smoothing the lapel of her blazer and kissing the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“You go be terrifying. I’ll be here when you’re done conquering the media world.”</p><p>Alice stared at her for a long moment.</p><p>Then she nodded.</p><p>As she opened the front door, Jen called out, “And hey!”</p><p>Alice turned.</p><p>Jen grinned. “Don’t forget to lie to a billionaire.”</p><p>Alice smirked. “That’s the plan.”</p><p>Then she was gone, heels clicking against the hallway floor, bag slung over her shoulder, head held high.</p><p>And Jen?</p><p>Jen watched the door for a few seconds longer before turning back to the living room, muttering, “God, I love her.”</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The apartment was quiet, golden light spilling through the windows as late morning edged toward afternoon.</p><p>Rio sat cross-legged on the living room floor, her laptop open in front of her, sticky notes spread in every direction like petals in a storm. She had one earbud in, a pen stuck behind her ear, and a look on her face that meant she was either writing a killer exposé or plotting murder via journalism.</p><p>Agatha watched her from the kitchen, coffee in one hand, a half-burnt slice of toast in the other. She’d finally learned how to make breakfast… kind of. The smoke alarm had only gone off once this week.</p><p>Progress.</p><p>Rio didn’t look up when she spoke. “If you’re staring at me again like I’m some dramatic court-themed novel, I swear—”</p><p>“You look annoyingly focused,” Agatha interrupted. “It’s suspicious.”</p><p>“That’s because I am focused.”</p><p>Agatha leaned against the counter. “You also haven’t blinked in like five minutes.”</p><p>Rio pointed her pen at her. “I blink with purpose.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, walking over and dropping onto the couch behind her, legs draped lazily over the armrest. Her eyes drifted to the folders Rio had meticulously labeled: <em>Post-Trail Coverage</em>, <em>Survivor Testimonies</em>, <em>Corporate Cleanup</em>, <em>“The Woman Who Bled and Stayed” – Working Title.</em></p><p>“You’re writing about yourself,” Agatha said gently.</p><p>Rio’s fingers stilled on the keyboard.</p><p>“Not about me,” she corrected after a second. “About what happened. About people like me. Like us.”</p><p>Agatha was quiet.</p><p>Then: “You sure you’re ready?”</p><p>Rio finally looked up. Her gaze was steady, a little tired, but lit from within.</p><p>“I don’t know if anyone’s ever really ready,” she said. “But I don’t want her to be the last word.”</p><p>Agatha reached out and brushed a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. “She won’t be.”</p><p>They sat in silence for a moment.</p><p>The kind of silence that wasn’t heavy anymore—just full.</p><p>Agatha exhaled. “I got an offer.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “For what?”</p><p>“A position. At the firm that used to be my mother’s.”</p><p>Rio sat up straighter. “You’re joking.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Clean-up crew brought in a new board. They want to change everything. New ethics board, full transparency, fresh leadership. They offered me a place on the internal audit team.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You're considering it?”</p><p>Agatha sipped her coffee, then looked at her.</p><p>“I spent so long trying to run from her. Maybe now I get to overwrite her instead.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened.</p><p>“That’s poetic.”</p><p>“I thought you liked poetic.”</p><p>“I do,” Rio smirked. “Especially when it’s followed by a good, sexy mic drop.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, then leaned forward, resting her forehead against Rio’s.</p><p>“Still scared?” she murmured.</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered shut for a moment.</p><p>“Yeah,” she whispered. “But not of her anymore.”</p><p>Agatha closed the distance, kissed her gently—like punctuation. Like a vow.</p><p>When they pulled apart, Rio gave a tiny, exasperated smile.</p><p>“You just kissed me mid-sentence.”</p><p>“I’m rewriting the ending my beloved menace.” Agatha murmured.</p>
