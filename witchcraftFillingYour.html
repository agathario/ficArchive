<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Ah, shit,” Agatha groans as she, in slow increments, comes to in the hotel bed, her temples throbbing. She didn’t want to go to New York for the stupid symposium to begin with, and now look at her.</p><p>The strange woman in her bed shifts at the sound of Agatha’s voice, her arm brushing against Agatha’s in a flash of warmth as she moves it under her pillow. Her eyes remain closed. Agatha looks at her, at her fine face, dark hair, and delicate shoulders. The remnants of heavy black eye-makeup still stuck to her eyelashes. She can’t be more than, say, twenty-five. Fuckity fucking fuck.</p><p>Pulling the sheet to her, Agatha gets up, draws a hand through her hair. “Get up,” she says, loudly.</p><p>The woman – <em>Rio</em>, if Agatha remembers correctly, Jesus fucking Christ – only mumbles something in response and turns over, away from the noise. On her back, right below her neck, the black tendrils of a tattoo spiral across her shoulder blades.</p><p>Agatha’s too fucking old for this. “Get up,” she repeats. She’s been teaching for over twenty years; she knows how to make her voice carry in a room.</p><p>“Mhm.” Rio turns over onto her back, opens her eyes, squints a little at the light streaming in from the window.</p><p>She really is beautiful: porcelain skin, hair almost black against the white sheets, lips full and red. A little fucking fairytale princess, stumbled into Agatha’s bed. <em>God</em>, they must have been drunk last night.</p><p>Agatha’s headache seems to intensify.</p><p>At the sight of Agatha, Rio’s delectable mouth, implausibly, curves into a smile. At least it’s one up on the look of horror Agatha was expecting.</p><p>Rio stretches, in a feline, languid fashion, and says, a little throatily, as if she’s <em>trying</em> something, “Morning.”</p><p>“Good morning,” Agatha says in a flat voice, still desperately clutching the sheet against her naked body. She nods sharply toward the door. “Now kindly get out of here.”</p><p>Rio drops her arms back down from her stretch. She sits up and deliberately, it seems, lets the sheet fall away, revealing her tits – so goddamn young-looking and <em>pert </em>Agatha suddenly feels even more like some disgusting creeper – with their dusky nipples. There is heat in her eyes and as Agatha meets her gaze, her lips part. “Or you could come over here,” she says.</p><p>Agatha laughs, a shrill, mirthless sound, too loud in the hotel room. It reeks of sex – she’s going to have to air it out before she leaves.</p><p>She sees her underwear on the floor and grabs them, starts to pull them while retaining her grip on the sheet on in an undignified little jump-dance routine. “I’d rather not get dragged in front of my department head and fired for fucking a student, thank you very much. Please get out of here before the whole hotel wakes up.”</p><p>“I’m not,” Rio says.</p><p>Agatha raises her brow. “You’re not a student? I guess there must be another Rio Vidal, post-graduate student, doing her dissertation on contemporary literary depictions of the Salem witches around here somewhere then.”</p><p>Rio tilts her head. “Aw, you remember my presentation.”</p><p>“In other words: you<em> are</em> a student,” Agatha says. Her voice is even, but she can feel the panic spreading in her chest. She took a goddamn <em>student</em> up to her hotel room after one too many glasses of wine last night at the reception for a fucking one-night stand. Fucking hell.</p><p>“Not <em>your</em> student,” Rio says breezily, waving it away. “And if<em> I</em> remember correctly, you made me certain promises last night.”</p><p>“I’m surprised you remember anything of last night,” Agatha says flatly. She wonders how many glasses of wine Rio downed before she thought it was a good idea to go hit on an old, decrepit historian who hasn’t published anything remotely interesting in years. If she thinks Agatha is going to mentor her or something, she’s out of luck.</p><p>Agatha looks away from Rio, tempting and inviting on the bed, and twists around to look for her bra, seemingly nowhere to be found.</p><p>She bends down to see if it has fallen behind her suitcase; when she rights herself, Rio is right there, naked in front of her, dangerously close, warmth emanating from her body, her skin.</p><p>“I remember,” Rio says, lowly. Her eyes are very dark and this close, Agatha can see the scatter of freckles across her nose. “‘In the morning.’ That’s what you said last night when I wanted to eat you out.”</p><p>Heat flare up, low in Agatha’s belly, from Rio’s proximity – the scent of her, heavy on her unwashed skin – and her words. She remembers it too, remembers Rio’s fingers deep inside of her, fucking her, thumb rubbing over her clit, remembers how fucking good it was, good enough that she couldn’t bear to stop for anything, needed Rio to just hold on, keep going forever, keep fucking her <em>just like that</em>.</p><p>The sudden flash of memory leaves her mouth dry and her skin hot, and she knows that Rio can feel it, can see it in the way her pupils dilate, her breath quickening.</p><p>Slowly, Rio’s hand reaches out, slips beneath the sheet, which is suddenly loose in Agatha’s numb hands, thumb finding its way upwards to trace along the curve of Agatha’s breast. Rio bites her lip, forehead furrowing as she slowly moves her palm up, a soft heat against Agatha’s incensed skin, and closes it around the breast, squeezes.</p><p>“Fuck, you’re <em>hot</em>,” Rio says on a breath, almost irritably, as if it’s something Agatha is doing to her, and Agatha would protest – she’s hungover, her hair is a bird’s nest, her make up gone, and it’s been ten years since she was anywhere near her prime, anywhere near Rio’s league, if she ever was – but Rio leans in and takes her mouth, kisses her, hard and sure, her thumb rubbing across Agatha’s nipple in a slow, burning arc of a caress.</p><p>Agatha says nothing. Instead, she lets her hand relax and the sheet drop forgotten to the floor. Lets Rio push her up against the desk in the corner and fall to her knees on the soft carpet, lets her pull Agatha’s panties all the way off again and bury her face between her legs. Rio moans as she gets her face all up in there and Agatha would say something along the lines of <em>please refrain from making fake porn sounds </em>but a moment later she’s not thinking anything at all, and when her mouth opens, it’s on a moan of her own.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I have your number?” Rio asks, later, last minute, when they’re packed up and ready to leave, stepping out from the lobby.</p><p>Right then, Agatha’s Uber rolls up, saving them both from this awkward situation Rio’s politeness has suddenly stranded them in.</p><p>Agatha pulls her sunglasses off her head as she steps towards the car, puts them on before she turns to say, over her shoulder, “You flatter me,” before she opens the door, and closes it firmly behind her.</p><p> </p><p>It’s 3:43 and Agatha is counting down the seconds until she can leave and go home. She’s made a rule for herself that she cannot leave the office for anything other than an emergency before four. And so she sits at her desk, heavily laden with books, piles of papers, and empty mugs gathering dust, staring at the empty document open on the screen of her laptop as the clock ticks forward at a glacial pace.</p><p>She’s had writer’s block for over a year.</p><p>Now she’s lying even to herself – it’s closer to two years.</p><p>Once upon a time, she was a promising young researcher, the pride and future of the history department, and now she’s just sitting here, painfully keeping up the appearance of being a successful scholar, simulating chipping away at research that is not being done. In a few months her grant runs out and then she will have to face the music. Will have to accept the fact that she fell off the tenure track two years ago and will never make it back. It’s all over.</p><p>She sighs, rubs at her eyes. 3:48. Only twelve minutes left before she can gather up her stuff and take the tube home, spend the night watching re-runs of <em>Friends</em>. Perhaps she will class it up with a glass of wine, a tub of ice cream.</p><p>However much she wants to leave her office where she feels like she’s slowly buried alive everyday, she dreads going into the corridor and being forced to engage with her colleagues almost as much as staying in here with her personal demons. It’s so <em>exhausting</em> to keep up the charade, play the functional dysfunctional academic with her colleagues – the endless stream of <em>Oh, yes, you know how stressful it is this time of year</em>, and <em>Don’t you wish the day had more than 24 hours </em>and <em>Have you heard about the huge research grant Paul just got – again?</em></p><p>Unbidden, the memory of the night in New York resurfaces, cuts through the murk of her day like a swathe of light through shadow.</p><p>She hadn’t planned to go to the symposium. She didn’t want to sit there, invited as a curtesy because of research she did fifteen years ago, an old crone droning on about things that the rest of them had already passed light years away from.</p><p>She really had planned on dropping out, but she had put it off, couldn’t really be bothered, and then all of a sudden September rolled around and suddenly it was only one day left, her train tickets and hotel booked, and by then it would have been too much of a mess to back out.</p><p>She had given her presentation, reliving her glory day by talking about the first-hand diaries of a few of the Salem witches she’d excavated from a pile of unsorted documents in an archive, like so much of women’s history literally thrown on the dust heap. Back then she’d believed herself to be the smartest historian around – now she recognizes that it was all luck. She wasn’t a particularly gifted scholar, she only happened to stumble on a treasure trove.</p><p>She could see how the participants, particularly the younger ones, sat there tapping away at their computers, responding to e-mails rather than listening to her tepid talk. Just like now, she’d counted down the seconds until the program was over and then she’d stumbled out of the seminar room towards the reception hall and too-quickly downed a full glass of wine, readying herself to mingle.</p><p>Sometime during the evening, Rio had sidled up to her. Agatha does not remember exactly what they’d spoken about – it had gone right out her head the moment she realized that Rio was flirting with her. Had she been sober she would have laughed, charmed, and left, but with the wine lending the evening a nice buzz, it was so easy to lean into it, lean in closer to Rio, look into her captivating eyes, and allow herself to think about what her hands would feel like on Agatha’s body.</p><p>Some time later they had stumbled out of the university building, down the street to Agatha’s hotel. Rio had pushed her up against the mirror in the elevator, the looking glass a shock of cool smoothness against Agatha’s overheated body, and kissed her so thoroughly it took them a moment to notice that the elevator had stopped and the doors opened. They were already closing again by the time they realized, and they started laughing as they hurried out, arms still wound around each other.</p><p>Agatha’s head thumps against the back of her chair. It had been a great night. She hasn’t been fucked like that in... years. Perhaps decades. Alison, her last girlfriend, had certainly never fucked her like that.</p><p>She remembers Rio’s body on top of her, next to her, below her, her fingers, her lips, her<em> mouth</em> as her hands pressed Agatha back onto the hotel room desk and parted her thighs, confidently made place for herself there and ate her pussy until Agatha thought she would collapse from the sheer pleasure of it.</p><p>She glances at the clock again. 3:59. Close enough. She slams her laptop shut and grabs her coat and handbag. A whole thirteen hours to herself, before she must return to this horrible stuffy room again, she thinks. Hooray.</p><p> </p><p>When she comes to work the next morning, there is a post it on her door, obnoxiously yellow against the dark wood paneling.</p><p><em>Seems I missed you</em>, it says in a lazy scrawl. <em>See you during office hours I guess xx</em></p><p> </p><p>She comes at the tail end of Agatha’s office hours, just before four, sauntering in like she owns the place. She’s in black jeans and boots, and beneath her leather jacket, a T-shirt with some obscure band logo on it peeks out. Her eyes are hidden behind black mirror shades, but her mouth is stretched into a wicked smile.</p><p>Despite the note, Agatha have not really expected her – had not allowed herself to.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio says, leaning against the doorway in a very annoyingly casually sexy way.</p><p>“My office hours are for my students,” Agatha says, in her best stern teacher voice, even though no students have shown up to avail themselves to her office hours in weeks.</p><p>“So you agree then,” Rio says, “that I’m not your student?” Her smile widens into an obnoxious grin that Agatha decides she will <em>not</em> find charming.</p><p>“This is the history building,” Agatha says. She’s feeling wrong-footed; isn’t sure what to do with her hands, or how obvious it is that she hasn’t done any work in months. How revealing, exactly, is the dust layer on the books heaped around her? “Unless you have a stated purpose here, I suggest you go back to the literature department.”</p><p>“Have dinner with me,” Rio says, seemingly not put off in the least by Agatha’s tone.</p><p>Agatha looks at her. “It’s four in the afternoon.”</p><p>Rio shrugs. “Okay, so come have a coffee with me, then.”</p><p>She’s hot, she’s charming, and for some reason she wants to spend her afternoon with Agatha, whose defensiveness doesn’t so much crumble as evaporate completely in the face of Rio’s offer: she shuts her laptop and grabs her coat.</p><p>Rio grins victoriously.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was thinking the Starbucks around the corner, but they end up in a cozy café downtown where she’s never been, all dark leather armchairs and bookcase-lined walls piled with heavy tomes and dented paperbacks.</p><p>Rio orders some god forsaken concoction with pumpkin spice and lord know what else, while Agatha settles for tea. It’s served in a charming little teapot with a matching cup and saucer, because of course it is.</p><p>As they sit down, Agatha’s phone buzzes. She takes it out of her pocket and glances at it. It’s a text, from <em>Mother</em>. With a lump suddenly forming in her throat, she puts the phone on silent, sticks it back into her pocket to forget about it.</p><p>Rio is watching her. “You need to reply to that? I can wait.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha says, a little haltingly. “It’s nothing.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t push. Instead, she takes a sip of her drink and asks, with a mischievous smile, “So, have you thought about me?”</p><p> </p><p>If she would have allowed herself to think about it, Agatha would have assumed Rio had asked her for coffee to talk about research. Theirs do, after all, overlap. But five minutes in, Rio simply says, “I’m so fucking tired of my dissertation right now,” and moves on to ask Agatha we’re she’s from. Unlike Agatha, born and raised in Massachusetts, Rio is from New York, and the expected ribbing takes them first to the topic of good food, then vacations, and after that, favorite authors.</p><p>Twilight falls around them as they sit there, talking. </p><p>Rio takes Agatha’s arm as they walk out of the coffee house. She pulls her in close, sending Agatha’s heart thumping, leans in to say, “Come home with me.”</p><p>“I have to feed my cats,” Agatha says. It’s, sadly enough, not an excuse – Scratch and Sparky will riot if she’s not home within the hour.</p><p>Rio tilts her head. “I’d love to meet them,” she says.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Oh my god</em>, how do you even tell them apart?”</p><p>Scratch and Sparky, the traitors, are eagerly flocking around Rio, who is kneeling on the floor, delight on her face as the two cats try to headbutt each other out of the way in their hurry to get Rio to scratch their ears.</p><p>“Sparky has a big white spot under one paw,” Agatha replies. For lack of anything better to do, feeling unmoored by having Rio, unexpectedly, inside her home, she goes into the kitchen to scrounge up something to eat.</p><p>The state of her home, however, is only marginally less sad than that of her office. She’s rustling through the back of her fridge, where there should be some olives, when her phone buzzes again.</p><p>With a sigh, she closes the fridge, brings the phone out. Despite herself, she opens the text chain with her mother.</p><p><em>You ungrateful child</em>, the latest text read. Before that: <em>I did my best with you, but you were a wicked child, cold and selfish</em>. And before that, which Agatha had ignored and thus prompted this new deluge of motherly guilt tripping: <em>Please call at your earliest convenience – I haven’t heard from my only daughter in weeks</em>.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>Agatha starts at the sound of Rio’s voice, almost dropping the phone. “Yes,” she says, a little too loudly. “Yes,” she repeats, more calmly, putting the phone firmly down on the counter as if that will make her forget about it. “Just looking for some food, but I’m all out.” She makes a <em>what can you do about it</em> face in Rio’s general direction, hoping that she will get the hint and clear out so that Agatha can drink a little too much wine and feel maudlin on her couch in peace.</p><p>Instead, Rio comes closer, cages Agatha up against the kitchen counter. Embarrassingly, it immediately sends a red-hot pulse of pure <em>want</em> all the way through Agatha. She really is too old for this.</p><p>“I’m not actually here for dinner,” Rio says, and leans in to kiss Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fuck,” Agatha moans, putting both hands against the headboard to brace herself, lifting one leg up in the air to get Rio deeper, let her fill her up, fuck her harder.</p><p>Rio, completely shamelessly, had ruffled through Agatha’s bedside table, brought out the dildo and harness Agatha’s kept unused in there for years, quirked her brows at Agatha and said, “You wanna?”</p><p>Agatha did want. Even when Rio had almost put her off entirely by looking back down into the drawer and going, “Woah, you have lot of lube.”</p><p>“Well, I’m a fifty-year-old woman,” Agatha had snapped, crossing her arms in front of herself as if to protect herself from something. “A necessity of age, I’m afraid.”</p><p>Rio had only looked at her. “We’ll see,” she’d said.</p><p>And apparently, Rio does have some sort of magic touch, because ridiculously, embarrassingly fast, Agatha is wet and open for her, begs her to fuck her, moans like <em>she’s </em>the porn-damaged one as Rio slides into her in one sure, unbroken movement. She tries to push against Rio, desperate for it, but Rio holds her down and takes charge, but doesn’t hold back, fucks her hard and deep until Agatha is a moaning, gasping mess.</p><p>“Fuck, you’re hot,” Rio says. It’s sounds out of breath, mindless, and when her eyes meet Agatha’s, they’re dark with blown pupil and desperate intent. “Agatha, you’re so fucking hot, fucking you is so fucking hot, fuck, I need to be inside you <em>for the rest of my life</em>.” She punctuates her last words with sharp, staccato snaps of her hips and Agatha’s nails scrabble at the headboard, trying to hold on, even as all she wants is to let go, to surrender herself completely to Rio and the impossible, wonderful, fantastic fucking she’s getting.</p><p>“Next time,” Rio grits out, and she’s gasping now, from exertion or horniness or both, Agatha doesn’t know, doesn’t <em>care</em>, “Next time, I want you from behind. I want to slide into your fantastic fucking pussy from behind, okay, have you on your hands and knees, make you take it. Fuck!”</p><p>She shoves in hard and Agatha moans, enthralled by the image Rio’s conjuring.</p><p>She takes one hand off the headboard to let it slide down between her own legs, desperate to come. She tries to hold back and savor it, but it comes hurtling like a crash, lightning fast, and she’s gone, her orgasm hitting her like a freight train.</p><p> </p><p>Afterwards, when she’s brought Rio, insanely wet and geared up from fucking Agatha, off with her hand, she tries subtly to hint that it’s time for Rio to leave. Either Rio misunderstands or simply chooses to ignore her, because instead of getting up she rolls over onto her side and promptly falls asleep.</p><p>It takes Agatha a lot longer, lying still in the dark, uncomfortable with the sudden, unexpected presence of another’s body in her bed.</p><p>It’s not until Sparky jumps up to lay on her stomach, purring up a storm, that she finally falls asleep, stroking her velvet-soft ears.</p><p> </p><p>“I have this fantasy,” Rio says as she comes strolling right into Agatha’s office, a take-away cup of coffee in each hand, casually kicking the door close with her foot, “of having sex in your office. You’re up for it?”</p><p>She hands Agatha her coffee and smugly takes a sip of her own while watching Agatha splutter.</p><p>“<em>No</em>,” Agatha says at last, emphatically, and Rio just shrugs, says, “Worth a try.”</p><p>She rounds Agatha’s desk, leans her arm on the back of the chair, and bends down to kiss her. It’s a good one, slow and lingering, heating Agatha up more surely than the coffee will.</p><p>“I have a class to TA in ten minutes,” Rio says as she pulls away. She smiles. “Enjoy your coffee.”</p><p>There’s hazelnut in it. Agatha considers throwing it in the trash after the first cloying sip, but then she reconsiders and takes another sip, and then another. Not as bad as one would expect, she thinks to herself, and finishes the whole cup.</p><p> </p><p>The next weekend Rio is away for a conference, and Agatha finally has the chance to regain her bearings. She’s a fifty years old, failed academic who’s fucking a postgrad student. She’s an embarrassing cliché, and she doesn’t even want to begin to imagine what her mother or ex-wife would say if they found out. Or, lord have mercy, her <em>colleagues</em>. Or the university. Having a relationship with a student in another department isn’t technically against the rules, but a great look, it is not. Agatha doesn’t think her career would survive any more bad decisions on her part.</p><p>It’s been fun and the sex has been great, but it’s time to put an end to it, she decides over a glass of wine on her couch, some godawful sitcom she isn’t watching running on the TV in front of her. Whatever milf kink Rio has going is bound to burn itself out eventually, and then she can find someone her own age and Agatha will go back to being what she was always meant to be: a sad, lonely cat lady.</p><p>She sighs, takes another big gulp of wine, fingers anxiously playing with the chain to the locket hanging around her neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fuck – yes, yes, <em>yes</em>!”</p><p>She’s not quite sure how it happened, but somehow trying to break off their sex thing led to sex, Agatha straddling Rio on the couch, riding her fingers, pressed impossibly deep inside her. Her hands are clutching at the back of the couch, nails digging into the worn upholstery, as she shoves down, trying to get her even deeper. Rio’s face is buried in Agatha’s chest, kissing and licking at her breasts like she’s starving, moaning around them as she fucks up hard into Agatha.</p><p>It’s amazing, having Rio between her legs, Rio’s fingers inside her throbbing, pulsing cunt, seeing the adoring, dazed look on Rio’s face below her, her bottom lip caught between her own teeth, her breath wheezing out as she watched, enthralled, as Agatha rocks above her.</p><p>They’ve been going at it forever, and Rio is bound to feel the strain, blood circulation cut off by Agatha’s body, but she doesn’t complain, just keeps fucking her, hard and deep, exactly as Agatha needs it.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha says afterwards, as she, boneless, slides off Rio’s lap to lay on the couch. She might still be seeing stars. “Just hold on a sec, I need to catch my breath.”</p><p>Apparently, that is not in Rio’s plans; instead she slides down onto the floor and moves to kneel between Agatha’s languidly spread legs. Agatha’s moan is half pleasure, half exhaustion when Rio’s tongue slides against her, parting between her labia to move slickly across her clit.</p><p>“I want to make you cum again,” she says as she slides two fingers back inside her, and Agatha groans, so overstimulated it’s just on the right side of too much. Her head falls back as she trembles, and she stares unseeingly up into the ceiling as Rio has her way with her.</p><p> </p><p>Coming on the heels of three hours of amazing, brain-melting sex, it’s probably not surprising that Rio doesn’t take it well when Agatha afterwards blurts out: “I think we should stop seeing each other.”</p><p>Rio stiffens next to her on the couch. She says nothing, but her face is suddenly closed-off, sullen.</p><p>“Come on,” Agatha says, feeling annoyed at Rio’s reaction. What did she expect? “You’re a twenty-five-year-old fucking a woman twice your age, how did you think this would turn out?”</p><p>“I’m thirty-one,” Rio says. She snags her panties off the floor, pulls them on with a sharp tug, face turned away.</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “Not the point. This has been really fun, but I think the healthy thing for you to do is to find someone your own age.”</p><p>Rio looks up at her from where she’s rummaging on the floor after her T-shirt. “What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”</p><p>Agatha gestures with her hand between them. “I mean, I guess that you have a thing, but you’ll get it out of your system eventually.”</p><p>“A thing?” Rio repeats flatly.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says, wondering why Rio is being deliberately obtuse. “You know mommy stuff, a milf kink, or whatever you want to call it.”</p><p>Rio stills again, stares at her as if <em>Agatha</em> is the one being obtuse. “A <em>milf kink</em>?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “You’re saying that if I was to look at your search history right now, I wouldn’t find any milf porn?”</p><p>“I wasn’t aware you had any children,” Rio says archly.</p><p>“Come on,” Agatha says.</p><p>“No, you come on,” Rio says. “Is it so hard to believe that I saw you, thought ‘wow, she’s hot’ and wanted to fuck you?”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to protest but closes it again. “Okay,” she says slowly. “So that’s all this is?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio says, over-articulates it a little, as if to be really sure to get through Agatha’s thick skull. “That’s all this is.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha says again, picking at thread in the worn upholstery. She’s not sure why there is this staticky, distant feeling of disappointment in her chest, but she pushes past it. “Okay,” she repeats.</p><p> </p><p>The second time she asks, Agatha does give Rio her number. It’s convenient, and, she thinks, it will hopefully mean that Rio will be spending less time hanging around Agatha’s place of work.</p><p>It doesn’t, really, but it does mean that Rio starts sending her stuff like:</p><p>
<em>so bored in class, thinking about eating you out </em>
</p><p>
<em>saw you across the quad, i love those pants on you, makes me wanna take them off</em>
</p><p>and <em>what’s a good intro book on the timeline of the witch trials??</em></p><p>Occasionally, there’s a series of emojis Agatha does not even pretend to understand. She doesn’t respond to half of it, but that doesn’t seem to deter Rio in the slightest. It’s nice, Agatha has to admit, feeling her phone buzz and getting a message from Rio, following her through the ephemera of her day.</p><p>And if she starts wearing those purple pants Rio likes so much a bit more, it’s no one’s business but her own.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, good, you’re home,” Rio says as she knocks on Agatha’s door at nine on Saturday night. Agatha is all but ready for bed, in her floral dressing gown, hair piled into a messy bun, make up washed off.</p><p>“Make yourself at home,” she says a bit testily as Rio is already halfway inside the apartment, kicking off her boots.</p><p>“I’m sorry about bursting in,” Rio says, completely unapologetically, “but my roommate’s having a party, and I <em>really</em> need to get in pages to my supervisor before the weekend’s over.”</p><p>She’s already slung her backpack on the catch, busying herself by getting her laptop and a pile of books out. “Hey, do you happen to have a copy of <em>Caliban and the Witch</em>?”</p><p>With a sigh, Agatha walks up to her overstuffed bookcase. It hasn’t been organized in years – just looking at the rows upon rows of successfully published scholarly literature gives her a deep sense of anxiety. It takes her a couple of minutes, but she does find the Federici book fairly quickly, still retaining its place in the bibliographic system she used to have.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio says distractedly, already hunched over her laptop as Agatha hands her the book.</p><p>“Can I get you something? Wine? Tea?” Agatha asks and it’s supposed to be pointed, but really, it’s just making her sick, watching Rio’s fingers dance feverishly across the keyboard, looking as if she’s in holy communion with her text.</p><p>“Tea would be nice,” Rio says after a beat.</p><p>When Agatha returns from the kitchen, two steaming mugs of tea in her hands, the clatter of keys has stopped, Rio anxiously chewing on her thumb nail while staring incessantly at the screen.</p><p>“Can you take a look at this?” Rio asks as Agatha hands her the tea. “I’m sorry to ask, but I’m just really stuck in this part of the analysis and it’s driving me crazy.”</p><p>“Sure,” Agatha says and reluctantly takes the laptop from Rio.</p><p>She reads through the paragraph once, twice, Rio staring at her over the rim of her mug. Rio’s a good writer, but clearly still a bit green when it comes to building and structuring an academic argument.</p><p>“Here,” Agatha says, drawing her finger across the cursor pad, marking a sentence near the end of the paragraph. “That’s your topic sentence – lead with that. <em>Then </em>you delve into the close reading, and then you have a much better segue into the next paragraph.”</p><p>“Oh, my god,<em> thank you</em>,” Rio says and accepts the laptop back with eager hands.</p><p>Agatha sits there for a while, sipping at her tea and looking at Rio typing away. After perhaps ten minutes, Rio glances up at Agatha.</p><p>“I’m sorry I’m ruining your Saturday night with work,” she says, as if Agatha had something more fun planned than staying in and cuddling with her cats.</p><p>“No worries,” Agatha says, feeling caught out. Blindly she reaches out to the stack of books piled next to the couch that she hasn’t bothered to sort into the bookcase and grabs the top one. “I have some work to get through as well,” she says and opens the book.</p><p> </p><p>In the morning, she wakes up to Rio spooning her, a warm palm sliding across her ribs and down to her front, softly cupping a breast. Rio makes a soft, pleased noise in Agatha’s ear, followed by a kiss to the nape of her neck.</p><p>“You awake?” Rio murmurs and when Agatha nods, she rubs her thumb across Agatha’s nipple, then rolls it harshly between two fingertips, making Agatha moan and arch back against her.</p><p>Rio’s body is a line of heat against her, thrumming with energy, her breath hot upon the back of Agatha’s neck. She kisses the knobs of her spine, then her neck, then bites softly at her earlobe.</p><p>Agatha wants to touch her in return; she starts to shift, rolling over, but Rio holds her in place. Agatha can feel the stretch of her grin against her shoulder.</p><p>“I want you like this,” Rio says, and Agatha has nothing to say to that. She twists her head around and Rio does grant her a kiss, moans into her mouth, bites at her bottom lip.</p><p>She works her other arm beneath Agatha and then she’s using both hands to cup her breasts, fingers going up to squeeze and tease. Agatha is writhing in her arms, already pent up. She’s panting and when she shifts on the bed she can feel how wet she’s getting, how much she hungers for Rio’s hand between her legs.</p><p>“Fuck, you’re wet,” Rio mumbles into her ear as she finally – <em>finally</em> – slides two fingers between Agatha’s eagerly parting labia to rub across her clit. Agatha moans, immediately starts to work her hips in tandem with Rio’s touch, trying to get <em>more</em> of it.</p><p>“God, you’re making me wet,” Rio says, voice low and rough. She keeps it going, the dirty talk, murmuring into Agatha’s ear what she wants to do with her, what she wants Agatha to do with her when she’s done.</p><p>It’s almost embarrassing how quickly she comes, with Rio’s fingers between her legs and her voice warm in her ear. Rio doesn’t seem to care, only makes a pleased noise. And when Agatha slides her fingers between her legs, she’s just as wet and swollen with need.</p><p> </p><p>The weeks pass quickly, September going on October. Soon Halloween is just around the corner, the whole city suddenly buried in an avalanche of pumpkins and plastic ghosts. Agatha used to have to field invitations to talk during this time of year – that’s what happens when you’re in the history on witch burnings, it seems – but for the past year she’s said no so many times that no one even bothers to ask anymore.</p><p>Instead of smarting from it, she spends her hours in the university archive, digging among its less organized sections.</p><p>Two years ago, she saw in a catalogue a mention of some old diaries belonging to a Piper Dahl, a student at Radcliffe College in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. Next to the mention was a vague notation –  something about a secret society and witchcraft.</p><p>It had propelled Agatha into immediately writing a research proposal about unearthing the existence of a hidden, forgotten secret society that existed to dabble in witchcraft at Radcliffe. However, in the proposal, she might have slightly overstated the usability of the material. When she cooled down and actually ordered the relevant documents, it turned out that the index notation might have made the diaries sound more exciting than they had been. The only thing about the diaries that pointed to witchcraft was the fact that they were so utterly boring and mundane, Miss Dahl or her descendants must have bewitched the registry to have them indexed at all.</p><p>Desperate to find something else, <em>anything</em>, to shore up her overblown project, she had spent days wading through the unsorted mess in the basement of the Radcliffe archive. She had found nothing – suffice to say, if the university ever lost power for an extended period of time in winter, Agatha now knew where one could find some good kindling.</p><p>Eventually she gave up, fell into a stupor and just stayed in her office typing nonsense on the computer to make it look she was working on something. However, in the past weeks, she’s regained some manner of her former purpose and so she’s descended into the archives again, searching the underworld for a way out of this hell of her own making.</p><p>“God, I’m glad I’m in contemporary literature,” Rio had said one afternoon when she came to pry Agatha away from the moldering documents.</p><p>Agatha had laughed and agreed, but the more time she spends down in the archive, the more she starts to remember what she used to love about her work. Digging through heaps and heaps of unsorted documents, hoping to find some glimmer of gold, something that can shine a light through the murk of history and tell something of a faraway time – it’s where she’s always been the happiest.</p><p> </p><p>The archive is technically a public place, but few people care to venture down into the basement. And even if they did, Agatha thinks as she sits on the edge of a desk and pulls her skirt up to her hips, Rio’s eager hands divesting her of her underwear, Rio’s mouth hot against her neck, jaw, and lips, they wouldn’t see them behind the stacks. Hopefully.</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha moans against Rio’s temple as Rio enters her, fucks into her with three fingers, fills her up. “<em>Oh</em>.”</p><p>They’re pressed chest to chest, Rio’s heart beating in tandem with Agatha’s, breathing the same air.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio mumbles into Agatha’s cheek, panting against her mouth, sounding a little sullen, a little needy. “Remember me?”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>,” Agatha replies, mindlessly, leaning back, bracing herself with her hands against the cool wood of the desk. As she does, her elbow knocks against a stack of paper and old notebooks, sending them crashing to the floor.</p><p>Immediately, Rio’s face moves to Agatha’s chest, moving her shirt – unbuttoned by Rio’s swift fingers within five minutes of her coming down here – out of the way to kiss at her breasts through the lace of Agatha’s brassiere, making Agatha moan louder. It echoes in the cavernous space.</p><p>It’s not until afterwards, when they’re tucking themselves back together, that Agatha looks over at the stack of documents sent crashing to the floor. An old, leatherbound journal on the top of the pile has fallen open, its spine softened by the decades.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha murmurs.</p><p>“I’m glad you enjoyed it, but you can call me Rio,” Rio says, busying herself with pulling her pants back on, but Agatha doesn’t hear her.</p><p>As if afraid it will vanish into thin air if she seems too eager, she slowly bends down and picks it from the floor.</p><p>It’s written in code, but what has caught Agatha’s eye are the symbols: a triquetra, a triskele, and Hecate’s wheel. She snatches it up – the paper rustles like dry autumn leaves in her hands. “Oh my god,” she says again.</p><p>“Don’t you mean ‘oh, goddess’?” Rio asks, leaning over her shoulder.</p><p>“What?” Agatha says, not at all listening, carefully turning a few of the pages, looking across the rows of neatly ciphered text. Then she opens it on the front page. It’s completely blank, except for the dark slash of ‘II.’ – it’s the second volume in a set.</p><p>Her eyes start roving across the floor, and, sure enough, there is a matching one. ‘III.,’ it says. Another one lies a few feet away. ‘I.’</p><p>“I feel like you’re in the zone,” Rio says from somewhere far away, as Agatha keeps surveying the floor like a bloodhound on the trail. “I’ll call you, yeah?”</p><p>She presses a quick kiss to Agatha’s cheek – Agatha mumbling something unintelligible in reply – and disappears up the stairs, leaving Agatha roaming the archive in search of more lost treasures.</p><p> </p><p>It’s a Vigenère cipher and it takes Agatha about a week to crack. The key is Piper’s whole name with her father’s name exchanged for her mother’s maiden name: Piper Eleonora Hannigan.</p><p>She only found the three volumes, but even so it’s a massive amount of text to decipher – she loads it off on a few of the doctoral candidates, making sure that none of them have any particular interest in the history of secret societies or witch covens so they won’t be tempted to use any of the material themselves.</p><p>She’s suddenly thrumming with energy – she approaches her pages of the diary with a frenzy, going over the small, faded letters until her eyes ache. She finally manages to get through most of the student e-mails she usually forgets to reply to. Her classes, which have felt like a millstone around her neck for years, suddenly feel inspired again and, somehow, her students seem to have gotten less annoying.</p><p>She starts sending Rio texts like <em>Come over, I need you, I want to ride you until I scream</em> and Rio does, puts on the strap and lets Agatha ride her until she sees stars, lets Agatha bite into the meat of her shoulder as she comes, pushes her onto her back on the bed and enters her again with a deep, hard shove, fucks her until she’s ready to come again.</p><p>She almost believes Rio means it when she presses her face against Agatha’s throat and mumbles into her skin how sexy she is.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hands in two whole chapters of her dissertation to her supervisor and wants to celebrate. Agatha doesn’t even protest, just brings her to a great Italian place downtown, orders them a bottle of really good red.</p><p>At that, Rio looks a little uncomfortable, shifts in her seat. Agatha covers her hand with hers, the touch hidden from view by the tablecloth.</p><p>“My treat,” she says. If Rio’s going to fuck a woman twenty years her senior, she might get some perks out of it. Lord knows Agatha is.</p><p>After the meal and several glasses of deep, rich wine, Rio, loose and relaxed, leans over and says, “This wasn’t exactly what I meant by celebrating,” looking across the table at Agatha with heavy-lidded eyes.</p><p>Agatha plays along, runs a finger along the edge of her glass, looking intently at Rio across it. “Oh?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio says meaningfully, voice velvet-smooth, tongue going out to lick across her bottom lip.</p><p>They end up fucking in the bathroom, too long and much too loudly.</p><p>“I don’t think we can ever go back there,” Agatha says as they walk home through the night, her arm slung around Rio’s waist, which makes Rio laugh.</p><p>It doesn’t feel remotely like a loss.</p><p> </p><p>For the first time in years, Agatha feels at peace. Of course, with the way the universe has it out for her, it all unravels two days later.</p><p>They’re in Agatha’s bed, post-coital and undressed, but working, Rio leaned against the headboard typing away on her laptop, while Agatha reads through the latest stack of deciphered journal pages, a marking pen between her teeth.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio says, after a long while of companionable silence. “What are you doing next weekend?”</p><p>Agatha holds up a finger to signal to Rio to wait until she’s finished the sentence. She spits out the pen. “Nothing,” she says, turning to look at Rio, lit up by the bluish glow of the computer screen. A love bite blooms low on her throat. “Why?”</p><p>“My friend, Alice, is defending her dissertation on Friday and having a party.” She flutters her eyelashes at Agatha, exaggeratedly. “You wanna be my date?”</p><p>Agatha snorts and turns the page. “Very funny.”</p><p>She disappears back into the reading; it takes her a moment to realize that Rio is completely silent and still next to her.</p><p>She looks up, gives Rio a confused look. “I mean, it was a joke, right?”</p><p>Rio’s lips thin, her face closing down. “No,” is all she says. She closes her laptop, swings her leg over the edge of the bed.</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “Come on,” she says to Rio’s back, stiff with anger. “You seriously want me to go to a party full of faculty and parade that I’m fucking a postgrad?”</p><p>“Well, you are, aren’t you?” Rio throws out. “Or at least you <em>were</em>.” She pulls on her jeans, her shirt, retrieves her socks from under the bed.  </p><p>“Hey,” Agatha says weakly. “We both agreed this would be casual!”</p><p>Rio shakes her head at her, grabs her backpack and starts walking towards the door. “You’re such a fucking idiot, Agatha Harkness.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Time doesn’t exist in Agatha’s apartment as she pours over a recently published overview of modern-era practices of witchcraft. She’s in a great mood; the book is terrible, and she finds much joy in marking dubious paragraphs with slashes of black ink and filling up the margins with an aggressive number of question marks. Scratch is asleep on her lap, Sparky on the desk right beyond the book – far enough to maintain her sense of sovereignty while assuring that her brother won’t get any undeserved extra attention.</p><p>Time rushes back in as her phone suddenly rings, causing Sparky to sit up with an offended meow, shaking her head. It only pulls Agatha half-way out of thoughts – thinking it’s probably her mother, she simply leaves it be.</p><p>The ringing cuts off, and then starts up against almost immediately. With a sigh and a disgruntled meow from Scratch, Agatha rises, swipes her phone from the coffee table.</p><p>It’s Rio.</p><p>She pauses, her heart giving a painful thump in her chest. Then she catches sight of the time – 00.13 – and immediately swipes her thumb across the green phone icon.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>“Heeeey.”</p><p>Rio sounds absolutely hammered. Which checks out, Agatha thinks sourly. If she had been in her right mind she wouldn’t have reached out after two weeks of radio silence.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha, heeey,” Rio continues, her words only barely comprehensible. Agatha can hear voices and the faint echo of music in the background. “I want to go h-home.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha says on a sigh. “That seems like a good idea. Give me your address and I’ll call you an Uber.”</p><p>Rio giggles. It sounds strange, coming from her. “Agatha.  Agat’a, can I tell you a secret?” Without waiting for a reply, she continues. “I’m soooo drunk right now. Everything’s spinning.”</p><p>“Rio, where are you?”</p><p>“Hold on,” Rio says, her voice suddenly sounding faint. “I’ll drop you a pin.”</p><p>“No, Rio, don’t ‘drop me a pin,’ I don’t know what that means!” Agatha says, exasperated.</p><p>Rio laughs, still sounding distant. “Y’r so old. It’s hot.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha says, very annoyed. “Where are your friends? Are you out alone?”</p><p>Her phone dings, and when she looks at it, there is a notification with the address of a downtown bar.</p><p>“Aaaall alooone,” Rio singsongs into the phone.</p><p>“Okay, Rio,” Agatha says. “Stay where you are, I’m coming to get you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio truly is incredibly drunk. As Agatha walks up to the bar, she sees Rio off to the corner, leaned against the brick wall, eyes half-closed as if she’s about to take a nap. Despite the chill, she’s dressed only in a T-shirt and jeans, her tattooed arms pebbled with goosebumps.</p><p>“Agatha, heeey,” she says as she catches sight of Agatha, a stupid smile on her face. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Getting you home,” Agatha says irritably. “Get in the car.”</p><p>Rio comes easily, more sways into than leans on Agatha’s shoulder, and Agatha guides her to the car, step by unsteady step.</p><p>Rio all but falls into the car, forcing Agatha to prod at her until she moves into her seat so Agatha can sit down too.</p><p>The driver glances at Rio in the rearview mirror. “She better not throw up in the car.”</p><p>“She’s fine,” Agatha says impatiently. “Rio, what’s your address?”</p><p>It takes several tries, but at last Rio rattles of an address, and plops her head down on Agatha’s shoulder. Agatha doesn’t know if she’s asleep or passed out, but when they arrive outside Rio’s high rise, she has to prod Rio again before she starts moving.</p><p>“Hope your daughter feels better soon,” the driver says as they exit the car.</p><p>Agatha makes a face, has to resist the impulse to strangle him. “Thank you very much,” she says through clenched teeth and slams the door shut. He’s getting a 1 star, she thinks murderously before she embarks on Project Get Rio to Give Up Her Key. She has to look through all her pockets before she finds them in the back pocket of her jeans (who keeps keys in their back pocket?) and can unlock the door.</p><p>She guides Rio into the elevator, and, miraculously, Rio presses the button for ‘4’ all on her own.</p><p>“Yikes,” Rio’s roommate says when Agatha finally hauls Rio into the apartment.</p><p>Rio has definitely mentioned him before, but Agatha has completely forgotten his name. Benny? Biffy?</p><p>“She’ll need fluids, some Advil, and maybe a bucket in case she throws up,” Agatha says, happy to leave Rio, now completely limp against Agatha’s side and stinking of liquor, in Biffy’s hands.</p><p>“Woah,” he says. “My boyfriend just got off his shift, I’m out of here.” He is, in fact, dressed in a coat, backpack on.</p><p>“You’re a terrible roommate, Biffy,” Agatha says, irritably brushing hair off her face with her one free hand. She should have put it up before she left her apartment.</p><p>“It’s <em>Billy</em>,” Biffy says, eyeing Agatha in a very judgmental manner – quite uncalled for, in Agatha’s opinion. “Maybe see this as penance for being a terrible girlfriend?”</p><p>“<em>Excuse me</em>?”</p><p>Biffy rolls his eyes. “Sorry, I mean ‘partner.’” He walks past her, towards the door. “Advil is in the bathroom cabinet, bucket in the closet down the hall,” he adds with a wave of his hand. “Good night.”</p><p>With that he’s off, leaving Agatha gaping at the door closing behind him for a long moment, until Rio shifts against her shoulder.</p><p>She drags Rio’s limp, slight weight into bed. After a moment’s hesitation, she pulls off Rio’s socks and jeans, but leaves it at that. As Rio rolls beneath the duvet with an exaggerated groan, Agatha goes searching for Advil and a bucket.</p><p>She passes through the kitchen on the way back, grabs two bottles of water from the fridge. She forces Rio, who sighs pathetically at being forced to sit back up, to drink one of them and puts the other on her bedside table, next to the pills, the bucket right beneath.</p><p>Agatha straightens, clears her throat. “Well – sleep tight then.”</p><p>Rio sighs dramatically, and makes an aborted motion, as if about to take Agatha’s hand. “Stay.”</p><p>“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Agatha says.</p><p>Rio groans in disappointment – an rather exaggerated reaction from someone who is already half asleep, Agatha thinks.</p><p>Clearly waging a losing battle against the closing of her eyelids, Rio mutters, “I hate being hungover and alone.” Her voice climbs an octave, “Allll aloooone.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha interrupts, holding up a hand against the ruckus. “<em>Fine</em>.” She can’t believe she left her cats and her half-finished article for this.</p><p>She turns away and undresses with quick motions. In the set of drawers in the corner, she finds a T-shirts and pulls it on.</p><p>By the time she slides between the sheets, Rio is dead to the world. She must feel the bed dip as Agatha gets in, however, because she rolls into Agatha, forcing her to open her arms and let Rio snuggle up against her chest. One warm hand sliding down Agatha’s spin and settles on her ass. Rio makes a pleased noise.</p><p>“Just go to sleep,” Agatha tells her sternly, but she doubts Rio actually hears it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is not an early riser by nature, but she’s never slept easily in another’s space. It takes her a long time to acclimatize, to be comfortable with a new person, in a place away from home. She wakes with the dawn, Rio still deeply asleep next to her.</p><p>It reminds her of their first night together, Rio’s face now serene next to her, pale against her dark make-up, smudged and blurred. She really is lovely, Agatha thinks, and fights the impulse to stroke Rio’s cheek or the slope of her nose.</p><p>There really is no point staying in bed – she won’t fall back asleep anyway, so instead she extricates herself from Rio’s grip and gets up.</p><p>Rio and Biffy’s kitchen is, if possible, in an even sorrier state than Agatha’s. The only thing that might count as breakfast food is a carton of pop tarts, and Agatha is not that desperate.</p><p>She goes grocery shopping, finds a store around the corner and buys eggs, bacon, real butter, bread, a lemon, and orange juice. She doubts she wants to drink whatever passes for coffee in the Rio-Biffy household and grabs a cup from Starbucks on the way back.</p><p>She’s in the middle of making Eggs Benedict when she hears the distinct noise of the groan of someone waking up with an unholy hangover from the direction of Rio’s bedroom.</p><p>When the eggs and bacon are done, she plates the breakfast, finds a cutting board that can double as a tray in the absence of an <em>actual </em>tray (she rolls her eyes at it; she might not do much cooking in her kitchen, but at least it’s properly outfitted), and pours orange juice into two tall glasses.</p><p>“Just kill me,” Rio mutters as Agatha enters the bedroom with her breakfast offerings.</p><p>“I spent over an hour on breakfast,” Agatha says, “so kindly eat first.”</p><p>Rio opens one eye. The Advil is missing from the bedside table and the water bottle half-empty. “...What’s for breakfast?”</p><p>“Eggs Benedict.” Agatha places the tray on the bed.</p><p>Rio slowly moves into a sitting position. She looks a bit clammy, eyes squinting towards the breakfast tray. Agatha is thankful that the bucket remains empty.</p><p>“You made me breakfast in bed?” Rio asks, rubbing a hand across her eyes.</p><p>Her unguardedness makes Agatha squirm. “Yeah, well, don’t get used to it,” she snaps, rounding the bed to sit down on the other side. She grabs her own plate, pushes the other closer to Rio. “Just eat.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio inhales the food and the orange juice in three seconds flat and then makes grabby hands for Agatha’s coffee. She drinks half in one gulp, grimacing at the taste of coffee unmediated by caramel or pumpkin spice.</p><p>“Thank you,” she says quietly, when breakfast is done, the cutting board tray moved to the floor.</p><p>“Don’t mention it,” Agatha says stiffly, suddenly regretting all the embarrassing trouble she’s gone through. She should have settled for the mouldy pop-tarts.</p><p>Rio lies back down, closes her eyes for a few seconds. Her leg relaxes outward, her knee brushing gently up against Agatha’s thigh, which makes Agatha’s breath catch.</p><p>It’s not planned or mediated, but rather as if their bodies simply naturally gravitate towards each other, an incessant pull dragging them together in the middle of the bed. Rio’s hand soon finds itself beneath the hem of Agatha’s borrowed shirt, palm warm and smooth against her hip. Mindlessly, one of Agatha’s fingers goes down to trace the slashes of black forming a nest of thorns across Rio’s bicep. Her other hand smooths over Rio’s left thigh, where she has a Tarot card – Death – tattooed.</p><p>“Very morbid,” Agatha had remarked one of the first times they’d slept together. Rio had grinned. “Well, if we 69, it’ll be in reverse,” she’d said, which had made Agatha laugh.</p><p>Neither of them is laughing now. There is no playfulness between them, just an undeniable pull, like the moon and the tides, they way they’re drawn together, Agatha rolling on top of Rio to kiss her – gently at first, and then more deeply, more ravenously. Rio sighs as Agatha cups her chin, tilts her face up, easily opening up beneath Agatha. Agatha echoes the noise, grinds down against her, feels their breasts crush together and Rio’s legs spreading around her hips.</p><p>Rio’s hand moves in under Agatha’s shirt again, slides higher to cup her breast. She looks intently up at Agatha as she flicks her nipple sharply.</p><p>In return, Agatha nips at her lower lip, before drawing back – smirking at the noise of loss escaping from Rio as she sits up. She pulls the shirt over her head.</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Rio mumbles, ridiculously.</p><p>When Agatha moves to lie down atop her again, Rio grabs her hips to guide her upwards, until Agatha’s tits are right above her face, sucking her right nipple into her mouth as Agatha lower herself down on her arms. She moans, resting her forehead against the wall, cool against her skin, over Rio’s bed.</p><p>Rio’s hands go up to cup her breasts, moulding them into her palms, mouth alternating between them, and Agatha can feel fire licking along her spine and low in her belly, the answering throb in her cunt.</p><p>When Rio lets her go at last, Agatha slides back down, kisses her briefly on the mouth, before she continues downwards, down between Rio’s legs. Eagerly, she lifts her hips to allow Agatha to slide off her underwear.</p><p>As Agatha’s tongue moves between the folds of Rio’s cunt and finds her clit, Rio sighs, seems to slump down further into the mattress.</p><p>Agatha goes slow at first, as she knows Rio prefers it – teases with small, soft laps and gently circles the tip of her tongue around her swollen clit. After a while, Rio’s fingers clench in Agatha’s hair and, accordingly, Agatha increases the pressure and the speed, eats her out with long, sloppy licks until Rio’s entire body bows and she gasps and shudder her way through her orgasm.</p><p>Rio doesn’t even bother pulling Agatha’s panties down as Agatha moves back upwards – she simply shoves her hand down there, fingers desperate and eager against Agatha’s pulsing, slick cunt. Agatha’s breath hisses out between her teeth as Rio’s fingers skirt over her clitoris and then downwards, into her. She moans.</p><p>Rio smiles against her collarbone, presses a messy kiss there, then does it again in a slow, steady tempo: rubs two fingers across Agatha’s clit and then continues downwards, enters her and pulls back up in a slow, torturous drag.</p><p>Rio bends down, sucks Agatha’s nipple back in her mouth, works at it with her tongue and, lightly, with her teeth. Agatha moans and jerks against Rio as Rio’s fingers flick against her clitoris.</p><p>“God,” Agatha mutters, head falling back, thrusting her breasts more firmly into Rio’s appreciative face.</p><p>She’s still working Agatha with that slow, mindless pressure – skirting across her clit and then back down and inside her, neither as hard nor as deep as Agatha wants it, <em>needs</em> it.</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Agatha mumbles as Rio changes it up, rubs at her steadily. But as soon as she can feel the pleasure building, licking at her bones, thigh muscles tensing, Rio slides her fingers down and inside her, presses in more deeply, fingers sliding up against that spot inside her that sends sparks up her spine and out into her hips. But as Agatha starts pushing down against her, fucking herself on Rio’s fingers, she reverses again.</p><p>After a long time of blissful torture, Agatha whines against Rio’s throat. Impatiently, she shakes her head to get hair out of her eyes – until Rio’s free hand moves up to stroke it away.</p><p>“Let me co-me,” Agatha groans – complains, <em>begs</em>, really – against Rio’s jaw, the final word broken up by a gasp as Rio’s fingers slide back inside her, only further fuelling the thundering wave of need rising inside of Agatha but doing very little to satisfy it.</p><p>Rio hums in reply, the noise reverberating against Agatha’s cheekbone. “I see,” she says thoughtfully, fingers sliding back up, across Agatha’s clit, making her jerk against her. Her mouth moves to Agatha’s ear, her breath hot against the shell of it. “You really think you deserve it?”</p><p>Agatha moans, and draws back a little. Rio’s eyes flick up to hers. She cannot read what’s on Rio’s face.</p><p>“I don’t think so,” Rio says. “Not yet.” Her other hand goes up to Agatha’s breast, fingertips rolling her nipple between them, gripping hard enough that Agatha arches her back as another moan slips out of her.</p><p>Agatha swallows. Her hips are moving of their own accord, a silent plea of <em>more</em> against Rio’s body. She’s too hot, too desperate, her need like something primal and impossible inside her. She buries her face against Rio’s throat, another moan punching out of her as Rio plunges her fingers back inside.</p><p>“Please,” she pants into Rio’s throat. “<em>Please</em>,” and that, apparently, is the secret password, because then Rio finally lets her come.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you have any weekend plans?” Rio asks, later, when the tremor in Agatha’s limbs has finally ceased and both their breathing returned somewhat to normal. There is something in Rio’s tone, a faux casualness, as if she’s really asking something else.</p><p>Agatha lays back against the pillows, puts her arm under her head. “Not much,” she says, truthfully. “Some work. And there’s this Georgia O’Keeffe exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts I’ve been planning to go to for a while.”</p><p>Rio makes an intrigued noise.</p><p>Agatha glances over at her. “You want to go?”</p><p>Rio reaches down, takes Agatha’s hands and braids their fingers together. “Why not,” she says.</p><p> </p><p>Before the museum, Agatha needs to get home to feed her cats and change clothes while Rio washes off the previous night.</p><p>Rio gets there before her, and greets Agatha with coffee and bagels from right across the street. At 3.45 it’s a late lunch, but it’s a good call. They eat on the stairs to the museum, Rio keeping her shades on despite the overcast sky, the only evidence of her hangover.</p><p>God, Agatha thinks as she watches her. To be thirty again.</p><p>They throw away the trash and make their wave up the stairs. Agatha cannot help but glance at Rio as she passes close to Agatha.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” Rio says, her face inscrutable behind the dark glass, but she sounds like she’s teasing. “I’ll keep a friend-appropriate distance.”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth, but then they’re inside, the reception lady looking expectantly at them.</p><p>“Oh, and I’m an adult,” Rio adds with a shit-eating grin, as she gestures at the admissions sign.</p><p> </p><p>It’s been a long time since Agatha have had someone to do stuff with. She finds most people annoying, but it’s nice, having Rio’s company – even if she insists on carefully reading on every little plaque in the exhibition, making their trek through the hall slow going. Soon Agatha starts drifting ahead, Rio falling a couple of yards behind her.</p><p>Agatha rounds a corner, and, immediately, her eyes widens. She makes an aborted attempt to turn back around, but it’s too late: the woman standing in front of <em>Blue and Green Music</em> in the small alcove has already seen her.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Rebecca smiles as she turns away from the painting, and Agatha can see that she’s pregnant. Her surprise must show on her face, because Rebecca lets one hand drift down to her baby bump, and says, with a beatific smile, “Our third.”</p><p>“Congratulations,” Agatha says, itching to back up and away, to cut this short, wondering why Rebecca had decided on today of all days to crawl out of the suburban hell she’d absconded to with her yoga teacher after their divorce. “Well, tell Melinda I said hi.”</p><p>“Wait,” Rebecca says, taking Agatha’s arm. “It’s good to see you.”</p><p>“Sure,” Agatha says, not even pretending to sound sincere.</p><p>“I’m glad I ran into you,” Rebecca continues. “I’ve been meaning to ask you – do you remember that green glass bowl my mother gave us for a wedding gift?”</p><p>Vividly. It’s what she uses to serve Scratch and Sparky their wet food.</p><p>Agatha scrunches up her face in thought, makes a considering noise. “Um, I’m gonna have to go with no? It’s been a while, as you know,” she adds, prettily as poison pie.</p><p>Rebecca’s face freezes with irritation, her friendly facade cracking.</p><p><em>At least we still got it</em>, Agatha thinks bitterly, as if either of them needed any further reminder of what a terrible couple they’d made.</p><p>“Well, if you could have a look, even after all these years,” Rebecca says. “It was a gift from <em>my</em> mother after all. I can’t help that <em>your </em>mother...”</p><p>At that moment, Rio suddenly appears around the corner. She looks between them and then sidles up to Agatha, directly behind her shoulder, close enough Agatha can feel the heat of her body.</p><p>Rebecca trails off. Rio’s hand goes to the small of Agatha’s back, Rebecca’s eyes tracking the moment.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio says, to Agatha. “I’m ready to move on to the next room, if you are.”</p><p>“Hello,” Rebecca says, eyes flicking first between Rio’s touch, her tattoos – visible near her wrists and on her hands – and her jeans with a tear across the knee, and then to Agatha.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio says, sweetly. “I’m Rio.”</p><p>And without thinking, carried away in that moment by Rebecca’s stiff smile and the warmth of Rio’s touch at the small of her back, feeling for the first time since the divorce that <em>she</em> is the one on top, Agatha opens her mouth and says, even as it makes her sound like a fifteen-year-old, “My girlfriend.”</p><p> </p><p>That night, in Agatha’s bed, Rio folds Agatha almost in half as she fucks her, one hand firm on the back of her thigh, pushing it up and back and she slides inside her, the other going around her throat, not to press or choke, but simply to rest there, a maddening, grounding pressure against Agatha’s skin.</p><p>She lies there, pinned in place by Rio’s gaze as surely as the weight of her body, her touch. Rio pulls out, and shoves back inside in a long, sinuous, grinding motion, stilling with eyes fixed on Agatha, who squirms beneath her, pants with need as Rio keeps them there, suspended in time.</p><p>“Did you mean it?” Rio asks finally, quietly, and Agatha gazes back at her, swallows against the weight of Rio’s hand on her throat, and says, “Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Apparently, Rio never did meet a U-Haul joke she didn’t take as absolute, lesbian creed. A week later, Agatha’s apartment is suddenly infested with stuff that is not hers, Sparky has abandoned Agatha for the greener pastures that is Rio’s lap, and out of nowhere, her fridge fills with gleaming cans of Monster energy drink, which Rio consumes at an alarming rate.</p><p>It’s not <em>horrible</em>, per se. One day, she accidentally brings Rio’s copy of <em>Powers of Horror</em> to work instead of her own, and it’s nice, weaving her own thoughts along the notes and symbols left there in Rio’s hands like a trail of crumbs. However, she is already rueing the day their respective closets will somehow merge, and she’ll unwittingly show up at work in a pair of artfully distressed jeans or something equally terrible.</p><p>A few days later, Agatha gets a text from an unknown number, and when she swipes it open, it’s from Rebecca, the first one in years. She expects another haughty reminder about the stupid bowl, but it’s not.</p><p>
<em>Don’t take this the wrong way – I only say this because I care about you, Agatha. I think you need to work on yourself instead of solving your problems by having a relationship with a student. Take care, Rebecca</em>
</p><p>“I would,” Agatha tells her phone viciously, pressing her finger needlessly hard on the screen to delete the text, “but <em>someone</em> ruined yoga for me forever. Cunt,” she adds, throwing the phone down on her sofa.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Professor Harkness, please – is there any way I can convince you to raise my grade?” Rio asks, her voice shrill, eyes widening, as her hand moves beneath Agatha’s dress, up her thigh, a slow, fiery caress with only one possible end-goal.</p><p>“Stop that,” Agatha gasps, back pressed against the bookcase in her office. She’s wearing thigh highs; she throws her head back against the thick tomes as Rio’s fingers reach bare skin.</p><p>“You’re right, I’m sorry,” Rio says in her normal voice. “You don’t like that, do you, Professor Harkness?” She cups her hand over Agatha’s cunt through her underwear and Agatha shifts, tries to push against the evasive pressure.</p><p>Rio gathers up Agatha’s both hands in her free hand and raises them above Agatha’s head, pins them against the row of books above. She tilts her head, consideringly. “You prefer it when <em>I</em> do what I want with <em>you</em>, don’t you, Professor?</p><p>Agatha’s mouth falls open. Rio bites at her throat.</p><p>“I’m going to fuck you,” Rio tells her, very seriously, before she kisses Agatha. Slowly, her hand moves further upwards beneath Agatha’s dress, grabs the edge of her underwear and pulls them down until they catch at Agatha’s spread knees.</p><p>“Mm, you’re so hot like this,” Rio continues, licking along the shell of Agatha’s ear.</p><p>Her hand goes between Agatha’s thighs again and Agatha’s breath hitch and catch as she waits for the plunge of Rio’s fingers into her. Instead, they still maddingly out of reach, forcing Agatha to shift her hips down in one sharp movement to take Rio inside of her.</p><p>Rio swallows the moan Agatha makes as she takes her mouth into another kiss, a stupid, triumphant smile on her lips.</p><p> </p><p>After that, they start fucking more or less regularly in Agatha’s office. Agatha cannot quite remember what her reservations used to be about – it is, after all, a <em>fantastic </em>idea. They do it against the bookcase and the door, with Agatha bent over her desk while Rio eats her out from behind, and, on one memorable time, with Agatha riding Rio in the corner armchair, her shirt daringly unbuttoned and pulled off almost all the way, despite it being in the middle of the day.</p><p>They’ve only had one close call, when an adjunct stepped into Agatha’s office without knocking first, but luckily Rio was already tucked away under the desk and out of sight, Agatha being forced to fake a very loud cough in order to cover up her snorting laughter.</p><p>If it’s late, they leave together. If it’s not, Agatha goes back to her writing – there’s nothing that primes her mind for writing like an orgasm or two. She’s deep in it now, following the siren song of the research, spitting out words like a woman possessed. She’s flying high, on top of the world, untouchable.</p><p> </p><p>“When’s the movie?” Rio asks. She is stretched out on Agatha’s couch, reading through a pile of photocopied articles, a cup of tea balancing precariously on her stomach, and Sparky curled into a ball of fur just beyond her socked feet.</p><p>“At eight thirty, I think?” Agatha replies, from the kitchen. Unfortunately, she let slip to Rio that she makes a mean gnocchi a few days ago – however, elbow-deep into half-peeled yams, she realizes that might have been a minor falsification of history. “You can check the confirmation text on my phone.” She rattles off her code.</p><p>She can hear Rio reach for the phone and then it goes silent. She is distracted, plopping cubed yam into a pot of boiling water as Rio comes into the kitchen.</p><p>“What’s this?” she asks holding out the phone.</p><p>Agatha glances at the screen. Right above the movie confirmation is her mother’s latest passive aggressive text. “Oh, that’s just my mother,” she says with a shrug, as if every nasty text doesn’t feel like a needle beneath her nail. The last one actually wasn’t<em> that</em> bad.</p><p>“She is... really mean,” Rio says.</p><p>Agatha looks over her shoulder as she starts the timer. “Wow, I guess your parents must have been saints.” She turns back to the food, brings out the flour and the butter. She drops the bag of flour on the floor; it’s only half-full but nevertheless, a cloud of white billows out all across the kitchen floor. “Fuck.”</p><p>“Hey, come here.” Rio tries to touch her, pull Agatha to her maybe, but Agatha immediately waves her off, steps back, emotion rising in her chest.</p><p>“<em>I’m fine</em>,” she says. She pushes tendrils of hair out of her face with an irritated motion. “Just... Just let me take care of this, okay?” Her voice rises at the end, in response to Rio moving forward, as if to hold her, again.</p><p>“Agatha...”</p><p>“Just get out of here!”</p><p>Rio’s face slams shut. “I can’t believe you’re the older one,” she says, crossing her arms across her chest. “You’re such a fucking <em>child</em>.”</p><p>“Well,” Agatha says, going down on her knees to wipe away the flour, “I guess it’s because I didn’t get enough love as a child, or something.”</p><p>Rio opens her mouth, closes it, then tries again. “And that’s a terrible thing! Why can’t you just admit it? Why is it that you only can be vulnerable with me when we fuck? Do you need my fingers inside you in order to acknowledge that you have feelings?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “Someone apparently thinks very highly of herself.”</p><p>“Oh my god.” Rio rubs at her temples, as if Agatha is giving her a headache. “You are unbelievable.”</p><p>“Well, I didn’t ask for this!” Agatha slams the rag she’s used to wipe, uselessly, against the floor, setting the white powder flying. “I was <em>fine </em>without you, and then you just <em>had</em> to show up and seduce me at that stupid symposium!”</p><p>“Oh, wow, okay. Well, my apologies for thinking that you maybe wanted me to join you in your hotel room when <em>you shoved your tongue down my throat</em> at that reception,” Rio throws out.</p><p>Agatha gapes at her. “I did <em>not</em>.”</p><p>“You did!” Rio rakes a distressed hand through her hair. “You did! Yeah, I flirted, but you kissed me first. Why can’t you just admit that you like me? Why does everything has to be so fucking hard with you?”</p><p>Suddenly feeling scooped out, emptied, Agatha slumps back against the kitchen cabinet. The back of her head makes a dull<em> thump</em> as it hits the wood. “You’re thirty years old,” she says.</p><p>If possible, that makes Rio look even more annoyed. She throws up her hands. “Oh, great – this again. What the fuck does that have to do with anything?”</p><p>Her pants are riddled with flour. She runs a finger along her thigh, making a line in the ghostly white. “Because when you’ve got me in deep, you’ll leave. Just–” She holds up a hand, silently asking Rio to hear her out. “You’re thirty years old,” she repeats. “You’re a PhD student. You’re at the start of your career. Sooner or later, you’re going to want to spread your wings. And then you’ll leave.” She sighs, picks at a hangnail to avoid having to look at Rio, feels like she’s split herself open beneath her gaze, all the soft part of her laid bare and unprotected.</p><p>“You’re an idiot.” Rio sits down next to Agatha, right in the flour, leaving only a sliver of air between them. “You seriously think my career is <em>not</em> the reason why I’m fucking you?” She waits until Agatha looks up at her and then grins widely. Cautiously, she reaches out, takes Agatha’s hand. “Yeah, that’s right,” she continues. “I’m willing to do <em>whatever</em> it takes, Professor Harkness – even put up with your terrible personality and how hopelessly <em>needy</em> you are in bed.”</p><p>Agatha snorts. She lets her head fall to the side, onto Rio’s shoulder. “I don’t know how to make gnocchi,” she says.</p><p>Rio laughs, pats her on the cheek. “Yeah, well, neither do I. You want to go out and grab something to eat before the movie?”</p><p>Agatha looks around at the state of the kitchen. “I should probably clean up.”</p><p>“We should get one of those robot vacuums,” Rio says. As she feels Agatha stiffen beside her again, it’s her turn to snort. “Too soon?”</p><p>Softly, Agatha says, honestly, “I don’t know.”</p><p>Rio leans down and presses a kiss to her forehead. “That’s okay. I’ve already made Scratch and Sparky love me – I think I’ll manage to win you over, too, eventually.”</p>
