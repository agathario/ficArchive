     Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Agatha is THE Hollywood star, America's Sweetheart, and absolute Hollywood royalty. She is a single mom to 16-year-old Nicholas Harkness,  a student at SHIELD High School.
      <br/>
      Rio is the new, science teacher at the Hollywood elite school and holds a strict no dating parents policy.
     </p>
<p>
      When Agatha’s famous chaotic reverie meets Rio’s down-to-earth simplicity, the attraction should be undeniable. But, the winds of fate have more in store for these two and their coven of friends as they come to terms with their love and desire.

<p>
     “There! It’s perfect!” Rio Vidal exclaimed as she placed the last plant on a bookshelf. Her new Los Angeles apartment was now completely unpacked and decorated. It felt like home.
    </p>
<p>
     She took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of the orchids and azaleas placed around the apartment. They weren’t the easiest plants to grow in planters and keep inside, but she had learned from the best. The bamboo plant was tucked into the corner of the dining room, which she took meticulous care of, and the succulents, which she carefully trimmed. They were probably her most prized possessions, something she had control over in a life in which she felt she had such little control.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You and your plants. You put more care into them than your actual lesson plans.” Alice Wu-Gulliver said from her spot on the couch with a teasing smile and changed the music playing on the Bluetooth speaker to a girl in red song.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio returned the smile as she looked over at her childhood best friend and pseudo-sister, and sat on the plush, forest-green couch beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Plants need love and care, you know that. Lesson plans are automatic at this point and follow a pattern and set of rules. I can write them in my sleep by now, and so can you."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had taught science for thirteen years and loved it. She took care when she planned her lessons. She just knew the material well, especially biology, botany, and chemistry. Her three major loves growing up in San Francisco were animals, plants, and blowing things up.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “No phoning it in at SHIELD, Ri. Calderu knows everything, and we have to keep the parents happy—or nannies, au pairs, whoever it is,” Alice said, leaning her head to the side. She began recounting the different families and broke down who did what roles in each.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio knew how high-stakes her new position at SHIELD was. The acronym stood for The School for Hollywood's Innovative Education and Leadership Development - a pretentious name for a place where Hollywood’s elite sent their children. Hardly anyone knew what it actually stood for anymore; it was simply SHIELD.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had first met the principal, Lilia Calderu, the previous spring when she had interviewed for the position from Rio’s hospital bed. She was an older, petite woman. Rio recalled how Alice had told her that Lilia had taught at SHIELD since she came to LA and had ingrained herself amongst the Hollywood elite, learning secrets and becoming someone they confided in. Now, she knew everything and was well-respected in the community. Her New York upbringing and Sicilian ancestry added to her persona, and when Rio first met her, she automatically understood.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice had taught in the history department at SHIELD since 2014 and helped Rio get an interview with Lilia once Rio told Alice she was leaving the school in San Francisco. The elite school in Los Angeles generally ran on a who-you-knew hiring system due to the unique demographics of the student body.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled. “Relax. I've got this, and you’re the reason I have this job. I’m not going to make you look bad. I’ve taught the children of the rich and powerful before. My old school catered to the upper class, too. This won’t be too different from that, from the sounds of it. Signing non-disclosure agreements as a career requirement is a little odd, and having seen some of the parents naked in movies, or having crushes on them, might be awkward at first, but I’ll adjust.” Seeing Alice’s face scrunch at that, Rio got serious and held up her hand. “Don’t worry. I learned my lesson about dating parents, especially famous ones, okay? That’s the entire reason I left and moved here, remember?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had made the mistake of dating a parent once, almost ruining her career. It had turned into a stalker situation when the woman could not let go, and after a series of unfortunate events, Rio had escaped for LA as soon as possible.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice smirked. “Oh, it’s not dating I’m worried about.” Alice lifted an eyebrow suggestively.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed and smacked her with a decorative pillow that said “Live Laugh Lesbian” on it, a housewarming gift from Alice one year. “I can’t believe that’s allowed!” She said, still laughing. Fraternization had been expressly forbidden at her previous school, which had complicated matters.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s one of the reasons we sign NDAs!” Alice exclaimed back, holding her arms up to block the pillow.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stopped her barrage, tossed the pillow onto a forest green armchair to her right that matched the couch, and grabbed her beer from the coffee table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Seriously, though, Alice, thank you so much for helping with everything. The job, finding the apartment, and being by my side. I am actually looking forward to professional development and in-service tomorrow for once, and not dreading it. I’m very curious to see who my students are, and more importantly, who their parents are.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a swig of her beer and reminisced on her previous years of teaching. Tomorrow would begin her fourteenth time preparing for a new school year, and it had long since lost its excitement. However, teaching in the same school as Alice for the first time in a decade and at this specific school was the beginning of a new adventure, and it reminded her of their first year of teaching.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice took a drink from her beer as well. “I’m just glad you’re finally here, and I can finally share everything with you again. The apartment was perfect timing since my neighbor moved out.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice and Rio had lived together before and were roommates in college and young adulthood when they taught together. Now, at thirty-five, they needed their own space but wanted to remain close. If the apartment next to Alice hadn’t come available, then they had both planned on hunting for the perfect place with two units together, or a duplex. They hadn’t been as close the past ten years due to distance and legalities. It had taken a toll on both of them, and it was time to put an end to that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you’re the only one excited about starting in-service at seven AM on a Monday at the end of July. Class lists are fun, especially at the high school level when we know most of them so well and what to expect. We can also just email or text the parents, personal assistants, or PR people in some cases now, depending on the type of relationship you have with that family, of course.  Some of the parents are pretty hands-on, which is unexpected for the higher-level celebrities, but nice, especially when it is the megastars.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took another pull of her beer and put it back on a plant-shaped coaster before settling back into the couch. “Which parents are super involved?” She held up a hand before Alice could object. “I have already signed my stack of NDAs and can know, so tell me.”
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice grumbled, though she had been dying to tell her best friend, her sister, really, about everything that happened at SHIELD and in LA in general. She wanted to tell her all about the families and her close friendships with some of the parents. She couldn’t wait for Rio to start joining her in spending time with her and her friends. Alice was so glad to have Rio back in her life for more than just holidays and breaks, and was ready to pick up where they had left off.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, for starters, Agatha Harkness and Wanda Maximoff are supermoms, believe it or not,” Alice responded, gesturing with her hands.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Wanda were both award-winning and globally beloved actresses. Given Agatha Harkness’s ‘bad boy’ persona, she knew that would surprise Rio. The media always portrayed them as doting moms with very busy schedules. There were also conflicting rumors that Agatha and Wanda were dating.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, meeting Alice’s expectations, was shocked. “Agatha Harkness? THE Agatha Harkness? America’s Lesbian Badass Sweetheart and everyone’s favorite Mother? That Agatha Harkness? HER SON GOES TO SHIELD?!” She shrieked the last part. Rio had been a fan of Agatha’s since before she could remember.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness was a trailblazer for LGBTQ equality, especially in Hollywood. She was a single mom, championing fertility procedures and putting a spotlight on reproductive methods, all families, and being a single mother by choice. She was also absolutely stunning, a global megastar and one of the greatest stars of their time. At fifty-one, Agatha was on her way to a triple EGOT — meaning she had won all four major awards, an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony, had been the youngest EGOT winner, the youngest Oscar nominee, the youngest Oscar winner, and just all around glass ceiling breaker. She was also known for her multitude of relationships, if you could call them that. It was part of what made Agatha, well, Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had very publicly cut ties with her mother at sixteen, and the entire country had rallied behind their teenage sweetheart, supporting her and embracing her identity. Everyone loved a juicy story, and Agatha had one. Rio had idolized her, and still did, though she had toned it down a lot since her youth. That woman had been her gay awakening. If she were to encounter her now, she might die.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The moment the realization dawned on her, her naturally tanned skin went pale, and she looked at Alice, mouth agape. Agatha’s son, Nicholas, was a teenager. Not that Rio followed Agatha on social media or anything, or that she knew he had just had a birthday in June.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha’s son, Nicky, he’s going to be a sophomore or a junior this year, yeah?” Rio asked, attempting to sound casual.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice laughed. The last ten years of non-disclosure agreements had bound Alice from discussing anything school-related with Rio. Unfortunately, since her friends and chosen family were also the parents of her students, this included much of her life. She had been dying to share all of this with her, and she knew that this specific information would absolutely break Rio’s brain and send her spinning.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s going to be a junior, you creepy lurker. He’s the quarterback of the football team,” Alice said, smirking.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m still getting used to there being sports and it being just like any other all-American high school and not like the one in ‘Fame’.” Rio interrupted. Alice rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Remember, it’s more than just the children of movie stars. It’s child actors, the children of star athletes, musicians, billionaires, the one percent, the elite, and even a few rocket scientists. Anyway, he has no interest in acting or stardom, is incredibly smart like his mother, and can be a troublemaker. He’s respectful, but if there are any pranks or general shenanigans, he’s historically been behind them. Agatha knows he’s not perfect, and she does hold him accountable. She’s a great mom. The Maximoff boys will be freshmen this year, and while Billy is a pure theatre kid, Tommy idolizes Nicky and will follow where Nicky leads, historically.” She finished and looked at Rio to make sure she was still breathing. She was, but still had surprise and a bit of panic in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     “Did you just call her Agatha and a great mom?” Rio’s eyes were glued to Alice as she drained her beer. “God, Alice. I have got to get a grip before we have Meet the Teacher night next week and school starts in two weeks.” Rio rubbed the left side of her chest to soothe herself from all the new information. A habit she had picked up from her childhood. “What’s the real story with Agatha and Wanda? Are the rumors true, or are they just really close like we are?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had always wondered about that relationship and Wanda Maximoff herself. The two stars had been fixtures in each other’s lives for nearly 30 years, were often each other’s ‘date’ to awards shows, starred together often, and were frequently pictured together. Yes, Wanda was married to Vision, and they had twins, but it was still very suspicious. Wanda never looked entirely comfortable when she was with Vision, always looking at something or someone, off to the side. There was an entire corner of the internet dedicated to the theory.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice had gone into the kitchen and grabbed water, yogurts from the fridge, and a bag of pretzels. She walked back in, handing one of each to Rio and putting the bag of pretzels between them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Most parents prefer first names, less formal, especially since their kids have been there since pre-K.” She sat back down, curling her legs under her. She chewed her lip in thought. Rio could tell Alice was debating whether or not she should add something to that. “As for Agatha and Wanda, they’re more sisters than anything. Agatha took her under her wing on the first show they did together, shortly after Wanda moved here when she was still a teenager. They had similar stories, you know that. They’re the emergency contacts for the boys. If one is out of town, the other picks up the slack. If they’re both gone, Vision is on kid duty. It’s a very cohesive family unit. Wanda is ‘Aunt Wanda’ and Agatha is ‘Aunt Aggie’.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had known Alice since they were twelve and had been taken in by Alice and her Gran. Rio knew Alice was holding back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice, stop holding back. You obviously know a lot. How?” Rio raised an eyebrow in question.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice sighed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha and Wanda are some of my closest friends. They’re more like my family. When I moved out here, Agatha insisted that they help me get acclimated. Something my mother and Gran would have wanted.” She shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, hurt that Alice hadn’t told her, but Rio knew that technically, due to Agatha and Wanda being connected with the school, that was part of the NDAs.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s mother, Lorna Wu, had been an actress as well. A friend of Agatha’s and the reason Alice had been raised by Gran, Lorna’s mother. Lorna wanted to keep Alice as far away from Hollywood life as possible and had rarely been in Alice’s life. Rio had met Lorna several times and thought she would have been a great mom.
    </p>
<p>
     Lorna thought otherwise. Rio was also hurt that Alice had called these women her family. Rio was happy that Alice had found a family in LA, but Rio had been so alone in their hometown once Alice left. Alice was her family.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice continued, bringing Rio back from her thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     “Knowing them for so long, it weirds me out when I hear gossip about the two of them being an item because they are more like sisters than anything else. Agatha practically helped raise Wanda,” Alice had finished her yogurt at that point and was using her spoon as emphasis. “Imagine if we were to date,” she added, grimacing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gasped, not as insulted as she probably should be.
    </p>
<p>
     “HEY! I am a catch! You would be lucky to date me!”
    </p>
<p>
     She laughed, knowing Alice was right. They had known each other for twenty-three years, and even though they had been each other’s first kiss ‘for practice’, could be tactile with each other without issue, and could hold the other through heartbreak, actually dating or anything else would just feel wrong. Rio got up to throw away their empty yogurt cups and put away the spoons.
    </p>
<p>
     “I get it, though. We would co-parent with each other if we were to have kids. That’s never going to happen, though. I much prefer cats and plants, and you are a dog person. I still can’t believe I’m going to teach Agatha Fucking Harknesses’s son.” Rio walked back to the living room and leaned against the doorway. Alice turned to look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Remember, you said you weren’t going to mix with your students’ parents romantically.” Alice teased, a knowing gleam in her eye.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, please, she’s fifty-one. I am way too young for her. Just because she was once my dream woman,”
     <em>
      And I damn near died the few times she was at Gran’s when we were growing up,
     </em>
     she thought to herself. “doesn’t mean a thing. I am a professional, and I will stick to my personal rules and boundaries. If these women are your friend group, I assume you’re going to drag me into it. Dating your friends typically doesn’t go well for me either. I can look and admire, though. ” Rio shrugged, pushing off from the doorway to sit back on the couch, picking up the bag of pretzel sticks and opening it. “Besides, my last girlfriend was much older, started as a friend, had kids, and look how that turned out.” She took a bite of a pretzel. “So, tell me about the parents that are not your friends.” Rio pulled her knees under her and munched on the pretzels as Alice launched into stories about the Starks, Langs, Sam Wilson, and other famous parents.
    </p>
<p>
     They finally called it a night around ten as they had to be at work early to start preparing for the semester. Alice stretched as she unfolded herself and got up, almost falling over as she stood, and shook out her legs and feet to regain circulation in them.
    </p>
<p>
     “You probably should’ve tested that out first,” Rio laughed, putting her feet on the ground first before standing. “We can’t sit folded in on ourselves for that long and just pop up like daisies without consequence anymore. Lock the door behind you, please!” Rio stood once the tingling in her own legs had faded and turned toward her bedroom. The two had keys to each other’s places, partially for this reason.
    </p>
<p>
     “Will do, love you!” Alice called over her shoulder as she left.
    </p>
<p>
     “Love you too,” Rio shouted back. It was a habit they had. Something they had learned firsthand to do. Always tell the people around you that you loved them every time you departed, no matter where they were going or how long they would be gone. She heard the door close and lock. She would go back and lock the deadbolt before bed. Right now, she needed a shower after all the moving and unpacking from the day. She turned on music for the shower speaker, background noise so she didn’t feel alone, and headed for the en-suite, glancing at a tortoiseshell-colored lump in the middle of her bed.
    </p>
<p>
     “There you are, Raven! I see you’re making yourself at home.” Raven was her seventeen-year-old cat. Rio had adopted her when she and Alice had their first place fifteen years ago, and Rio had retained custody ever since.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Once under the shower’s hot water, enveloped in steam with Taylor Swift playing in the background, Rio massaged the shampoo onto her scalp and thought about the upcoming school year and what lay ahead. She would meet some huge celebrities from sports, film, music, and even politics. She was excited and nervous about this journey, and hoped her past didn’t follow her here. Shampoo was washed out and switched to conditioner as she remained lost in her thoughts, thinking about the colleagues she had already met, the insane security detail, and the security measures. When you had that many famous children altogether, you had to have heightened security, extra legal measures, and state-of-the-art everything. She couldn’t imagine the pressure put on the administration or the board of trustees.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was excited about the budget, though, and the opportunities it provided. The tuition, donations from parents, and unnecessary fundraisers throughout the year, though half of it went to charity, would provide ample funding for teachers to do anything they wanted for their students.
    </p>
<p>
     She scrubbed the sweat and grime from unpacking off her skin as she thought back on her conversations with Alice and what that meant for the future. Exactly how much had gone unsaid for the past ten years? Rio had still told Alice everything in the past decade. Her dating life, career woes, dating woes, and the stalker issue. Alice had come and bailed her out in the spring when she had hit her version of rock bottom.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hadn’t known much about Alice’s life in LA. She knew about a few people she had dated and knew she had made friends, but nothing beyond that. They still spent holidays and birthdays together, but even then, a lot of things had been vague. Alice had always been Rio’s protector, they joked about Alice being her Knight of Wands. A callback to a movie Alice’s mother, Lorna, had been in with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She turned off the water and dried herself off. She was hoping that she and Alice could become as close as they once were, now that Rio had signed the same paperwork that Alice had. This whole weekend, and tonight especially, had been a good start. They so easily fell back into their old habits.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was also somewhat worried about how well she would teach this demographic of children. Yes, she had taught kids with famous parents before, but not at this high of a caliber. Not children who were potentially not impressed by anything, and had access to all types of educational resources if they wanted to utilize them. How was she supposed to keep them engaged in learning? Maybe she wasn’t cut out to teach the children of the Hollywood elite, and elite in general. She sighed. Clearly, this was just impostor syndrome. Everything would be fine. Lilia wouldn’t have offered her the position if she didn’t think she was more than capable. SHIELD paid ridiculously well and did not hire just anyone. You had to be overly qualified and know someone.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She climbed into bed, exhausted, and Raven snuggled up to her, knowing she was stressed. Rio set her alarm and switched to her bedtime playlist. The very first song was from a movie Agatha had starred in with Lorna Wu called “The Witches Road”. Agatha had sung the theme song for the movie, winning her a Grammy and an Oscar for the song and best actress. It was one of Rio’s favorites, and she drifted off to sleep with Agatha’s voice in her ear as she had so many times before.

<p>
<em>
      “Please welcome my next guest, the double EGOT winner, multiple everything winner, America’s Sweetheart, activist, just all-around amazing person, and one of my personal close friends, Agatha Harkness!”
     </em>
     Drew Barrymore announced to a round of applause and cheers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha walked out and danced to Demi Lovato’s ‘Confident’, meeting Drew halfway. Agatha had originally suggested ‘Womanizer’, but Drew reminded her that she had already done that once. It had been during a time when Agatha had been pictured out with multiple women each night. Agatha had been having a great time, and so had the media. ‘Confident’ was more fitting this time.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wore a black halter jumpsuit with purple stilettos, her signature color and shoe style. Her long chestnut hair was pulled up, and her iconic three-goddesses locket was perfectly attached at the collar. Agatha was just the appropriate amount of professionalism and attractiveness for daytime TV, a balance she had perfected decades ago. Drew looked extremely adorable as always in a white long-sleeve shirt, dark grey pants with a matching vest, a purple tie that matched Agatha’s shoes, and purple ballet flats. They had coordinated previously on colors, and Drew looked very
     <em>

     </em>
     . She was only two years Agatha’s junior but exuded a youthful energy. Agatha and Drew had been in an exclusive circle of child actors who had known each other since they were in diapers and had very easy chemistry as they were friends outside of acting. Drew pulled Agatha into a giant hug as the excitement from the audience died down.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Drew! It’s so good to be here again!” She said as she settled into her place on the guest couch and crossed her legs at the knee. “The girls aren’t too sunburned from this weekend, are they?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Drew waved off the question. “Not anything a little aloe vera couldn’t soothe. We had such a great time hanging out with you guys this weekend! We even have some pictures!” As Drew said it, pictures popped up on the screen positioned between them. One of Drew, Agatha, and Wanda around Agatha’s pool in swimsuits, a second of Wanda’s twin boys, Agatha’s son, and Drew’s two daughters, and the final was a picture of Nicky pushing Agatha into the pool. The audience laughed, and Agatha pretended to be shocked. Drew smiled and continued.
    </p>
<p>
     “As everyone knows by now, we’ve known each other most of our lives, and you’re one of my most popular guests.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course I am,” Agatha smirked, drawing reactions from the audience.
    </p>
<p>
     “Always so humble,” Drew quipped. “Before we start, I wanted to give you something to put with all of those awards you have.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed in response. It was the natural chemistry she and Drew had that kept the producers, and Drew, insisting on her coming back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I guess what it is first?” Agatha asked, raising her eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, I wasn’t going to make it easy, you get three guesses.” Drew was aglow with excitement.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was in full character, the persona she put on for the cameras, and she knew Drew was prepared to match this side of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s obviously an award, so, hottest guest of all time?”
    </p>
<p>
     Drew rolled her eyes. “Nice try, no.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, then simply Mother Harkness or Most Likely to Lead an Army of Sapphics.” She winked toward the audience, where she swore half of them swooned. People often asked Agatha why she didn’t date, and why would she? Why use just one crayon when there were so many different colors to choose from?
    </p>
<p>
     “I should have gone with the biggest ego, no. Most Reoccurring Guest. This is the first week of our fifth season and your eighth time here.” Drew handed Agatha a plaque.
    </p>
<p>
     “Anytime, Drew.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Drew switched gears back to the previous weekend. “So, back to the pictures and the weekend, I keep having Agatha come back because she constantly has new projects going on, but also we’re friends, as you can see in the pictures.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “Wanda Maximoff lives next door,” Agatha heard snickers from a few people in the audience whom she was addressing. She would never beat those allegations. “So any party or gathering at my house usually involves her and her family as well. Our three boys are in high school and get along so well with Drew’s daughters, though they’re in middle school. We’re soaking up the last few weeks of summer and had a little impromptu pool party.” She turned back to Drew to let her continue leading the conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your son, Nicky, just turned sixteen. How’s driving going?”
    </p>
<p>
     The audience groaned in sympathy.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “Yes, thank you. I thought him playing football was nerve-racking! I’m just glad I’m not in charge of the driving. Vision, Wanda’s husband for those of you who don’t know, has been in charge of that, so I don’t wind up in the news. He’s extremely patient, whereas I am not, and Wanda is too nervous, and Nat, our head of security.” There were a few claps and cheers from the audience at the mention of Nat. She had a small cult following. Agatha flashed a slightly evil grin. “Ladies, she is single.” Drew threw her a dark look before Agatha continued. “Anyway, she is not the one you want teaching your sixteen-year-old to drive. We’ve decided that Vision is in charge of teaching all the kids to drive, including Drew’s girls.”
    </p>
<p>
     Drew nodded before pivoting.
    </p>
<p>
     “Speaking of Wanda and her family, your new movie,
     <em>
      Death’s Beloved,
     </em>
     premieres in October, and there’s already a lot of buzz around it. The two of you star opposite each other yet again, in a romantic role?” Drew’s right eyebrow quirked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed sarcastically and shook her head as the audience cheered. People were obsessed with the thought of her and Wanda being an item. They couldn’t be further from the truth.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, we’re married. I’m a detective chasing a serial killer, and Wanda is my wife. In the movie. We have a few scenes, and they are very well done. I’m so glad she’s the person I got to do it with. We have such great chemistry, and given that I consider her to be my sister.” She sent a look toward the audience. “It didn’t seem awkward or anything. Our intimacy coordinator was amazing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow,” Drew’s bright eyes sparkled. “I cannot wait. We’ve all heard the song already, and it’s gorgeous. Do you think this will be your third Best Actress Oscar win and third Grammy win? Completing that third EGOT?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. “It’s only August, and we’re still months away from nominations. I have no idea if the song or I will be nominated, and we know that doesn’t guarantee a win. If anything, Wanda deserves a nomination and a win for her work in the movie. Working opposite of her as another lead was amazing, and I hope we’re both nominated as leads since that’s truly what we are. There wasn’t a leading man, and I hope that is acknowledged.” She stated firmly. “Like you said, it’s not even out until October, and so much can happen between now and then.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Drew nodded seriously. “I agree with you, and we’ve discussed that it’s time for the awards committees to recognize that the leads do not have to be different genders and we need a broader range of categories.” A cheer of agreement went up in the audience. They chatted a bit more about the movie, Agatha sang the song “My Beloved”, and they wrapped the show.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     While resetting to begin taping the next episode, Drew gave Agatha a quick hug goodbye and thanked her for doing the show again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you see the picture of the new high school science teacher? Rio Vidal?” Drew asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. She hadn’t checked her email yet, though she was usually very eager to read about any new teachers joining the faculty for personal reasons. “No, why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s gorgeous. Maybe you should read up on your science, given your history with teachers at SHIELD, this may be one you don’t want to miss out on.” Drew teased as she waggled her eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. “Drew, please. I have stopped sleeping with the teachers, starting this year. Calderu is getting too old to deal with all that drama. Plus, she’s probably extremely young — “
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s 35.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly. I have an entire kid as old as that age gap. Thank you for trying, but you know me, Drew.”
    </p>
<p>
     Drew and Wanda had been trying to get her to settle down for years, the hopeless romantics that they were. It wasn’t Agatha’s nature, she’d rather find ‘em, fuck ‘em, and free ‘em. The three F’s. Agatha did not do romantic relationships, but she appreciated how much her friends cared.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Drew shook her head as she went back to the stage. “One day, Aggie. One day, you’ll find love!” Drew put her hand on her heart and exaggerated her gesture. “Oh, and uh, Nat’s behind you, she looks pissed about your comment.” Drew turned and walked off briskly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha blew out a breath and turned to see her and Wanda’s main bodyguard. She was a petite redhead and a former Russian assassin. “It was a joke, Nat.” Agatha quickly defended. She had known Nat almost as long as she had known Wanda, and had only been teasing.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You know I don’t date.” The younger woman said through clenched teeth, handing Agatha her bag and phone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “Nat, it wouldn’t hurt…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nyet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned. “You need to get laid.” Agatha followed Nat out to the car waiting for them. It was mid-morning, and they were headed back to Agatha’s house before going up to Nicky’s school later in the afternoon. Agatha and Wanda both needed to speak to his football coach.
    </p>
<p>
     “What I need and what I want are two entirely different things,” Nat replied in Russian, careful others might overhear.
    </p>
<p>
     “I got a few numbers of some very attractive women for you,” Agatha offered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Keep them, I did get the number of the woman with the blue and purple hair you kept looking at.” Nat handed it to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re the best wing-woman, Natasha.”
    </p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked around her classroom and smiled. She had gotten everything set up the way she wanted it. The assignment turn-in stations, absent work, grouped seats, expectations, the lab, and all the equipment. Not bad for two days of work. She had also met with the other science teachers and had her two weeks of professional development, meetings, lesson planning, and other before-school starting activities scheduled. Meet the teacher night was exactly a week from today, and her butterflies about it were settling.
    </p>
<p>
     Ms. Calderu had already talked with the three new-to-campus teachers about what to expect, and Rio had Alice to advise her. Alice had been right when she said that teachers didn’t leave SHIELD until they retired or died. The rest of the faculty had been here for years, and Rio took comfort in that. It meant Rio had a lot of people she could go to if she had any questions. She checked her watch, it was three, and Rio and Alice planned to go down to the football field at 3:30. The team would be in the weight room, but Alice was going to point out Nicky and Tommy to Rio so she could familiarize herself with them. There were a few other students Alice wanted to introduce her to as well, if there was time, and Rio hoped there would be a few parents milling about—namely, Agatha and Wanda. Rio had just zipped up her green teacher bag when Alice came in, loaded down with her own teacher bag and work to take home.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I thought we could drop our stuff off at my car before we went down to the fieldhouse,” Alice said as she walked into the room and looked around at the transformed space. “Wow, you wasted no time getting settled. It took me years to get my room the way I like it.” She added.
    </p>
<p>
     The two women had decided to carpool most days since they were coming from the same place. It made the most sense.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Sure, let me just grab everything.” Rio gathered her own take-home work and looked down at her outfit. She wore a Phoenix Mercury shirt, her favorite WNBA team, denim shorts, and green Nikes. Her shoulder-length, dark brown hair was pulled back in a messy bun. She was a hot mess and looked like she had been working in her room all day, which she had been. “Is this appropriate attire to potentially meet parents or students in?” She gave Alice a skeptical look.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice scoffed. Her black and red hair was thrown up in a ponytail, and she wore an old Led Zeppelin shirt, basketball shorts, and Converse. “It’s fine. Trust me, no one is dressed up around here until school starts. Everyone around here, students and parents, are still humans. Even Calderu had on joggers when I saw her earlier. It’s fine.” Alice reassured her as they walked out to her car. “I’m pretty sure I saw part of Wagatha’s security detail though, if you need to freshen up or something,” Alice teased.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Did you just call them by their ship name?” Rio gasped. Alice had insisted the two weren’t together, yet here she was, using the ship name people who were convinced they were dating would use for them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice laughed. “Even
     <em>
      they
     </em>
     agree it’s easier and use it for themselves. It’s a big joke to them.” Alice unlocked her Jeep as they dropped their stuff in the backseat, closed the doors, and relocked it. She joined arms with Rio and led her down to the field house. “Besides, it’s just Wanda Maximoff and Agatha Harkness. No big deal.” She added with a shit-eating grin.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her incredulously. “Okay, Ms. ‘My Mom Was A Hollywood Star’ and these are my friends. This isn’t exactly a normal Tuesday activity for me. Meeting your mom was one thing, and the few celebrities who dropped by, but this is completely different.”
    </p>
<p>
     The pair slowed as they approached the fieldhouse, which looked like it belonged to a college campus. A woman with dark red hair pulled back in a French braid that stopped between her shoulder blades, wearing a blue tank top and black shorts, stood beside the door, scrolling on her phone, but very alert.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, Alice! We’ve missed you.” She said, not even looking up.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice waved. “Hey, Nat. This is Rio Vidal, the sister I’ve told you guys about and SHIELD’s new high school science teacher. Rio, this is Natasha Romanov. She’s on Wagatha’s security team, and yes, they share the team.” Natasha’s eyebrow rose slightly at that. Alice turned back to the redhead. “So I assume they’re in there.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Natasha glanced over Rio for a bit longer than necessary before offering a hand in greeting. “Nice to meet you, Ms. Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio blushed and returned the greeting. “Please, call me Rio.” Was LA just crawling with attractive women? Had she died and gone to lesbian heaven?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Rio, it is then. Call me Nat.” Nat looked back at Alice. “Yes, they’re going over schedules with Coach Rogers.” She turned back to Rio. “Trying to work past the Agatha Harkness nerves before you’re surrounded next week?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio blushed. “Is it that obvious?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Nat gave her a sweet smile. “Trust me, you’re not the first one. She’s a big deal. I’ve known her, both of them, forever. Don’t let her name or smile go to your…” She paused and looked her up and down. A gesture that the younger woman felt everywhere. “...head.” She finished. “They’re both very devoted parents, and when they’re on this side of the country, they’re present at everything. Also, so you’re prepared, Agatha has on a low-cut shirt and Bermuda shorts that show off every muscle with random tennis shoes. Wanda is wearing a very cute and appropriate sleeveless, black sundress with sandals.” She said with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice laughed as she saw the shock on Rio’s face. She knew that Nat was teasing and playing with Rio. She had told her friends about Rio and how she hoped to pull her into the ‘coven’ as they called themselves. This was Nat’s way of preparing Rio for the force that was Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Trust us, Rio, it helps when you go in prepared. Now come on.” Alice grabbed her hand and swiped her badge for the door to open. Alice leaned in and whispered into Rio’s ear. “Especially since she was your gay awakening.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s cheeks immediately went bright red.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They walked through the door, and Rio could hear the sounds of weights clinking against each other and boys purposefully grunting too hard. The air was also a mix of teenage boy sweat and various scents of Axe. She wanted to gag. They walked down the hall, and there in the main workroom were roughly forty boys on various machines. A tall boy of roughly sixteen who was running on a treadmill saw Alice, and his face lit up. He jammed his fingers against the buttons and hopped off, smacking the arm of the boy next to him. The boy who got off first had messy brown hair and blue eyes. He looked exactly like Agatha Harkness. The other boy was slightly shorter and thinner, not having as much muscle as the other, with straight brown hair and green eyes. He looked just like Wanda. They both came up to them grinning.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Hey Ali-Ms.Wu!” Nicky said, as he turned to Rio. “You must be Ms. Vidal. I’m Nicky Harkness, this is my cousin Tommy.” They both extended their hands, and she returned their greetings. They were very polite young men, but she wasn’t easily fooled. Rio was well-versed in teenage boys and had been warned by multiple faculty members about their true personas and the pranks they had pulled in the past.  Nicky turned back to look at Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom and Aunt Wanda are talking to Coach Rogers in the office. I assume that’s why you came down here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice raised an eyebrow in warning. “No first names at school, Nicky. You know that,” she reminded him. Rio was starting to see what Alice had meant about her being close with Wagatha and their family.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Nicky and Tommy both nodded as they mumbled a “Yes ma’am,” and went back to their workouts. Alice turned and headed to the offices, not making it far as the women they were looking for had apparently completed their meeting and were heading back.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Alice!” Wanda exclaimed, a wide smile lighting up her face. “We’ve missed you so much! You’ve been so busy this summer, and we’ve been wrapping projects.” She pulled the woman in for a hug. Agatha had been looking down at her phone, popped her head up upon hearing Alice’s name, and smiled brightly at her. She also pulled Alice in for a tight hug, greeting her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hung back, taking in the exchange. Realizing just how much of Alice’s life she had missed out on over the past decade. This looked like a small reunion, not reconnecting with the parents of students.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s train of self-pity derailed as Wanda’s bright green eyes landed on her. “You must be Rio! Alice has told us about you.” Wanda pulled Rio into a hug, too, surprising Rio as she awkwardly hugged her back. “I’m Wanda, welcome to SHIELD.” Wanda released Rio, who turned, right toward Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had grown up with Alice Wu, the daughter of the legendary Lorna Wu. She had met Lorna several times. Rio had even met a few other celebrities as she revolved around the Lorna Wu star, but Agatha Harkness was always the star to beat. She was the Hollywood celebrity and “it” woman of Rio’s most formative years. Now, here Rio was, about to meet her face-to-face as an adult. How she managed to have words or move was beyond her. She smiled and extended her hand. “Hi, Ms. Harkness, I’m Rio, Nicky’s new science teacher.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her hand with a laugh. “Oh, please, call me Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could’ve sworn she saw something flicker across those ocean-blue eyes and that her smile wavered, but Rio wasn’t sure why and shrugged it off, chalking it up to her imagination. Rio was internally screaming and trying so hard to remain calm. Agatha’s smile was electric. She was pretty sure that if the school lost power, Agatha’s smile alone could light the entire campus.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s nice to meet you, Agatha. I’m a huge fan.” She cringed internally—stupid thing to say. Agatha laughed again, her blue eyes sparkling.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Well, you know what they say, never meet your idols. Hopefully, I won’t disappoint you.” Agatha smiled genuinely, trying to keep her embarrassment from creeping across her face.
     <em>
      What the hell, Harkness? And stop laughing!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Eyebrow raised, Wanda glanced over at her best friend and took her cue. “Well, it smells like a teenage boy in here, and the mix of gym socks, Axe, and blue Gatorade is giving me a headache. Let’s continue this outside, shall we?” Wanda cleared her throat and slid her eyes down to where Agatha and Rio were still clasping hands. Agatha immediately dropped the younger woman’s hand and smoothed out her shorts absentmindedly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, right, outside.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice looked over at Rio, who was pretending to be very interested in something on the floor as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The four women headed outside into the late July air. An awkward silence between them, with Wanda and Alice exchanging knowing looks. Once they were outside, Nat fell into step behind them as they headed to the car that Wanda and Agatha were in. The boys still had another hour to practice.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “There was a write-up about each teacher in the newsletter, but it didn’t say what brought you to LA, Rio. Any reason in particular?” Wanda asked, looking over at Rio. Ideas were formulating in her head. She knew Agatha better than anyone, and that woman had never ONCE reacted that way when meeting someone. Agatha always controlled the situation, flirted, and decided what type of encounter to have, and that was that. Alice had already prepared Agatha that Rio was her sister and not to make things awkward. Alice wanted Rio to find a place within their little family, not become another one of Agatha’s conquests.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda, seeing how Agatha had reacted and reading her the way Agatha Harkness herself had taught her to, was pretty sure Agatha didn’t want that either.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had practiced answering this question to ensure it sounded real. She would not be telling people that there had been a dating/break-up/stalker situation that ended in heartbreak and disaster.
    </p>
<p>
     “The school I was at had minimal growth potential, and I decided I needed a change. Alice and I have been friends, sisters, since we were twelve, so I came out here.” She gave a friendly smile in her reply.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda nodded and smiled back. “That’s exciting! I’m so glad to have you join us here and look forward to getting to know you better. I wish we could chat more, but Agatha and I have a meeting to get to. We’ll see you around this week, I’m sure, and for sure next week.” Wanda knew Rio’s answer was bullshit as she remembered Alice running off to San Francisco unexpectedly last spring, and Lilia following shortly after. Still, she wasn’t going to call her out, yet. She looked over at Agatha, who still had a stupid smile plastered on her face. They were at their car when Nat opened the door, trying to usher them inside. They waved and asked the two teachers to email the class syllabi over to them. They already had Alice’s, but they asked anyway.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Once Wanda was sure the other two women were on the way to their car, she smacked Agatha’s arm hard. “WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT HARKNESS?!
    </p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
     Rio slid into the seat and put her hands over her face. “Fuck! I am so glad that the first meeting is over. I behaved like a tongue-tied fangirl. ‘I’m a big fan, ’ who admits that? She’s just so pretty, and confident, and involved, and…” She stared out the window as her words trailed off.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice was shaking her head as she pulled out of the parking lot. “And, she’s into you.” She said, ending her friend’s sentence, very matter-of-factly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio cackled. “She absolutely is not. She was busy messaging or whatever, and I interrupted her.” Rio used her hand to emphasize her point. There was not a world in which Agatha Harkness, goddess, was interested in her: Rio Vidal, teacher, and regular person.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice rolled her eyes. “Okay, sure. That’s what that was.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly. Do you want me to make dinner tonight?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Remember, Ri. I’m friends with them. We hang out regularly. They’re family.” Alice said calmly, though Rio’s scream of excitement was deafening.
    </p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha? Agatha? AGATHA!” Wanda had been trying to get Agatha’s attention since they had gotten in the car to no avail. Agatha could get so buried in her thoughts that she could block everything and everyone else out. Wanda waved her hand in front of her face, “Yo, ground control to Major Tom!” Finally, the older woman snapped out of it and looked around the large SUV. First at Wanda and then at Nat.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha finally replied, startled.
    </p>
<p>
     “What happened back there?” Wanda asked again.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha thought back on the last few minutes. She had raised her eyes and saw Rio. Her heart had quite possibly stopped when those brown eyes looked into her soul. Agatha had a body count a few miles long and she was no stranger to beautiful women, but this was different. She had also made an absolute fool of herself. She, who was always quick-witted and sure of herself, had said something stupid. Shook a hand for far too long. Needed Wanda to come to her rescue. Never in history had that happened before. Wanda was notoriously useless around women. She turned her eyes to Wanda and Nat.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have no fucking idea.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda’s grin illuminated her whole face. “Oh my God! You just fell hard for her! You like her!” She grabbed Agatha’s arm and shook her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow and looked at her best friend. “Absolutely not. I’m just dehydrated or something.” Echoing a young woman she once knew. “She’s 16 years younger than me, a teacher at the school our children go to, and I do not fall for people. People fall for me and then get their hearts broken.” She replied.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, that’s romantic.” Nat chimed in.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m very upfront about it first,” Agatha added.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because that makes it better,” Wanda added.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “Anyway, everything is fine. It was a fluke.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned her head to look out the window. Every time she closed her eyes, she thought of Rio’s smile.
    </p>
<p>
     She remembered the phone number in her bag and knew she’d be tearing it up and throwing it away when they got home.
    </p>
<p>
     No reason.

       Late July
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda was buzzing with energy, which had nothing to do with the wine she had been drinking. Her best friend in the entire world finally liked someone, and she, Wanda Maximoff, had witnessed the meet-cute.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They sat in Agatha’s living room, music playing lightly in the background. Wanda was snuggled in the corner of the plush black couch, legs crossed in front of her, body turned so she could see Agatha on the opposite end of the couch, and Jennifer Kale on the couch perpendicular to them. Jen was their right-hand girl. Manager, agent, public relations, friend, and all-around go-to woman for whatever they needed. Nat sat beside Jen, nursing a drink and reading something on her tablet.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, let me get this right. Agatha Harkness, our Aggie, actually acted like a tongue-tied teenager in front of a beautiful woman who happens to be Alice’s best friend?” Jennifer asked, her brown eyes wide, mouth open in shock.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, shut up. Even on my worst days, I’m still as smooth as that head of yours.” Agatha shot back, referencing Jen’s most recent haircut, as she had chosen a very short fade that made her appear bald. She was gorgeous, though Agatha would never admit it, and Jen exuded confidence with it.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda knew that this was how Jen and Agatha communicated; the two of them needed each other to remain employed and on top of their respective careers.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen, not missing a beat, quirked an eyebrow. “It’s better than that rat’s nest you call hair.” She shot back.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Stop it, you two, or I’m taking away the wine,” Nat said sternly, but with a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     They both mumbled, “she started it,” but stopped bickering for the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “Anyway,” Wanda continued, “she
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     Alice’s best friend, Agatha. You probably met her once or twice before Lorna died, since they’ve been friends for so long. I vaguely remember seeing her at Lorna’s funeral,” she recalled.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha thought about it for a moment and turned to Jen.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “We saw Alice a few times when she was young, for holidays and stuff. You know, Lorna kept her personal life and her Hollywood life divided, and Alice lived with Norma, Lorna’s mom. Alice was in college when Lorna died, and we were all disguised at the funeral since it was closed to celebrities and kept small considering everything. We were surprised Alice took the position at SHIELD as quickly as she did after Norma died. I’m sure I did meet Rio when she was a kid, the way those two were inseparable, but I don’t quite remember,” Agatha lied, the explanation was for Jen’s benefit as Nat and Wanda had been there at the time. Lorna had been a mentor and confidant for Agatha and was in their inner circle at the time.  Agatha would never forget the look on Rio’s face those two times they had accidentally run into each other two decades ago, but no one needed to know that. It had been entertaining, but she hadn’t been able to find much amusement in it for long. Agatha had been there out of concern for Lorna and her own need to speak to her urgently. “Obviously, I wasn’t paying attention. That would be weird.” She replied.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice had been twenty-two when her mother died from an overdose at an Oscars after-party. Norma died three years later.
    </p>
<p>
     When Alice started teaching at SHIELD, everyone was surprised she wanted anything to do with Hollywood, especially given how insistent Lorna had been on keeping Alice away from it and then what had happened.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda shrugged. “Still, you need to talk to her more, get to know her, ask her out…”
    </p>
<p>
     “...Date her, get married, have babies.” Nat finished with a sly smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, not you too!” Agatha gave an exasperated sigh. “It’s nothing! I was just, caught off-guard! That’s all! I need harder liquor for this.” She said as she got up and marched to the bar area beside the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just keep it out of the tabloids and away from the paparazzi, will you? I’m trying to generate award buzz for you two and am in negotiations for your next roles. I don’t need to be cleaning up after you screwing your son’s science teacher after last year's debacle.” Jen said, scrolling socials and media websites to make sure current chatter was all positive.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha decided it was better to get water instead of continuing to drink as she returned to the living room and sat on the couch, leaning against Wanda. “The only people I’m screwing are random models and people I meet that sign an NDA.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda and Nat both rolled their eyes and sighed as Jen smirked and raised an eyebrow. “That’s my hoe,” Jen grunted as Nat elbowed her hard in the side. Agatha chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Besides, Alice is family, and it’s just a matter of time before Rio starts spending time with us. I’m not going to sleep with a member of our little coven. No one else is pulling that trigger.”
    </p>
<p>
     All eyes landed on Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whoa, why is everyone looking at me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because it’s been ten years and neither of you have made a move,” Wanda sighed.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen shook her head. “We are not talking about me right now, this is about Agatha. Let’s go back to making fun of her, please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     In all honesty, Agatha knew that she would find an excuse to run into Rio the next time she was up at SHIELD. She suddenly was only interested in Nicky’s science class for the upcoming year.
    </p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat on her couch, eating the stir-fry she had made for both of them, as Alice turned off the episode of
     <em>
      The Drew Barrymore Show
     </em>
     they had recorded. “They are both going to be nominated for that Oscar, I bet Agatha wins it,” Rio said as she turned the music on for background noise, Freddie Mercury’s voice filling the air. “I haven’t even seen the movie, but judging by the song and everything that’s been said about it, I’m just going with it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ooh, maybe she’ll take you to the Oscars as her date!” Alice grinned ear-to-ear.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smacked her arm. “Stop it. She and Wanda will probably go together since they’ll both be nominated.” Rio ate the last bite of her dinner and took both of their bowls to the kitchen to put in the dishwasher and clean up. Rio typically inhaled her food and would wait until Alice was mostly done with hers before she started eating. “Plus, she is not into me. I’m sixteen years younger than she is, remember? Her son fits in that age gap. I’ve almost had Raven as long as that age gap. I have pants as old as that age gap.” She just shook her head as she put leftovers in a container for lunch the next day.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice rolled her eyes as her best friend returned and settled opposite her on the couch. “You’re smitten. You’ve been obsessed with her forever. The few times she was at Gran’s growing up, you nearly combusted.”
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s a difference between being obsessed with a celebrity and meeting them as a normal parent of one of your students. Besides, that was almost twenty years ago, I was a child, and it happened twice at Gran’s when we were teenagers. I thought Agatha was sleeping with your mom.” Rio recalled.
    </p>
<p>
     Lorna rarely came to Gran’s, trying her best to keep Alice away from Hollywood. She didn’t want Alice to fall into the life that had consumed her. Every time Lorna came home, it was in an attempt to get clean. Every time, she eventually relapsed, but she would try. Agatha came to visit her twice. They were on a TV show together then.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then there was the funeral, when she and Wanda were disguised, and Agatha pulled you aside,” Rio added solemnly.  When Lorna died, it was right after she had won an Oscar with Agatha for the song from The Witches Road, as well as Best Supporting Actress, and Best Feature Film. She had won three Oscars that night, and hours later, she overdosed and died.
    </p>
<p>
     Lorna had co-starred with Agatha in
     <em>
      The Witches Road,
     </em>
     and the movie had consumed her. It was an instant classic, shooting to the top ten of all the best movie lists. However, it was a dark movie and it had been said that Lorna couldn’t handle the subject matter.
    </p>
<p>
     Gran had been furious and held a very small funeral, keeping it closed to celebrities and anyone else from Hollywood.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda, Agatha, Nat, and a few other co-stars from that movie had snuck in. Agatha had pulled Alice aside and talked to her, slipping her information for a therapist, lawyers in case she needed them, and Lilia Calderu’s information for after graduation.
    </p>
<p>
     Lorna had always bragged about how Alice was going to be a teacher and influence the lives of children and have a lasting impact.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice had been bitter, but when Gran died, she finally called Lilia Calderu and applied to SHIELD.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice’s voice broke through the memories. “I remember!” She laughed. “I had to remind you how straight my mother was.” Which was true. She was a huge ally, but Lorna had been married multiple times to famous men. One marriage lasted only 28 hours, and she had zero romantic interest in women-something Lorna once called a tragedy.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head and smiled. “It’s still weird knowing that you’re technically Hollywood royalty, but I get surprised when I see you call these people by their first names or act so friendly with them. I’m still shocked that you’re friends with Agatha and Wanda.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The other woman shrugged. “I didn’t grow up in it. We usually weren't whenever Mom and her famous friends were at home. The few times we were, it was just as shocking to me as it was to you. I wasn’t close to these people. I know them now, and you will too. With this particular group of women, they’re my family, I was just bound by NDAs and couldn't say anything.” Alice looked at Rio before her eyes lit up. “Hopefully you’ll get really close to Agatha,” she added as she put her arms up to shield her face in case Rio smacked her with a pillow or anything else. They had had their share of pillow fights, and stuffed animal fights, Rio had used the occasional chancla, whatever was handy, growing up. They were millennials. It’s how they showed affection.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio just groaned. “No. Could you imagine? I’d have her fans try to murder me, I’m sure.” She thought about what Alice had said about being kept out of the spotlight, and she was right. She spent more time at Alice’s than at her own home as a kid and had her own room there by the time she was fourteen. It was a haven for her. Her parents hadn’t been great, and they never noticed when she wasn’t home either. When they died, she was a senior in high school, and Gran legally became her guardian, even though she technically already had been. Alice truly was the only family she had. Gran would usually send the girls away when Lorna would come home, not wanting them to see the detox process. She had been such a good mother to the girls. “She’s not into me, and I don’t date parents of students,” Rio added.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice just shrugged. “Whatever you say, Captain Oblivious.”
    </p>

<em>
<span>
       Early August
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     It was Friday, and there was still another week before school started. Rio had been trying to put that meeting in the back of her memories, but it kept replaying in her thoughts. She was sitting at her desk, working on her About Me and Meet the Teacher slideshow with Fletcher playing in the background. Rio was absolutely NOT picturing Agatha Harkness’s smile when there was a knock on her open classroom door. She looked up, expecting to see a coworker. Instead, standing in front of her was Agatha Harkness, as if Rio had summoned the global megastar with her mind. Agatha’s hair was down in soft waves down to her elbows. She wore a purple, sleeveless, button-up blouse, with high-waisted black shorts. Black sandals completed the outfit. She looked amazing and had that dazzling smile. Rio could’ve sworn she was dreaming and subtly pinched her leg under her desk. It hurt. Not dreaming.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi Rio, am I catching you at a bad time?” Agatha asked, having stepped slightly into the brightly lit classroom.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared for a moment before she remembered how to blink. Where was Alice? Wanda? Nat? A fucking mouse? Literally, anyone or anything would be helpful right now.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, no, just preparing some things for next week. How can I help you, Ms. Ha..” She faltered for a moment, “Agatha?” She smiled as she stood up and walked around her desk to meet in the middle, sitting on top of one of the student desks, painfully aware of the black basketball shorts and Pink Pony Club tank top she was wearing with a sports bra. Her hair was up in another messy bun, escaped strands falling around her face, and she had ditched her shoes an hour or so ago. Parents weren’t supposed to be in the building today, but Alice had warned her that Agatha was allowed to do basically whatever she wanted.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sat on a desk close to Rio, and they turned to face each other, an empty desk between them.
     <em>
      Great Agatha, now you have to come up with a reason as to why you’re here.
     </em>
     “Nicky has football practice,”
     <em>
      Okay, not a lie,
     </em>
     “so I thought I’d see which teachers were here to go ahead and see who would be signing up to do concession stand duty at games and maybe get supply lists. Everything I’ve been working on is currently in post, and all of my press and such is around here, so I have some time on my hands to be pretty involved, which is what I prefer.”
     <em>
      Okay, that sounded somewhat believable.
     </em>
     She thought to herself.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow. “You go school shopping with Nicky?” She asked. Did mega-celebrities actually do that? She wondered.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Depending on my schedule at this point of the year, yes. I really try to be as hands-on as I possibly can.” Agatha reiterated. “Same with working concessions at football games and track meets. I’ve seen firsthand what happens when people get caught up more in fame and leave their children to be raised by others. I swore I wouldn't do that when I had Nicky, and Wanda did the same with the boys. So here we are, our little chosen family, doing what we can to give them as much of a normal life as possible.” She explained. Why was she explaining this all to a stranger? She didn’t know. There was just something about Rio that made her want to tell her everything. She was so easy to talk to, and that was dangerous.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. Alice was somewhat a product of what Agatha was talking about, and Rio wondered if she was one of the children she was talking about, but she let it slide. “All of that information will be readily available on Tuesday at Open House.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      What the fuck Vidal?
     </em>
     She immediately thought to herself.
     <em>
      That is Agatha Fucking Harkness and you’re thinking about rules? Give her the goddamn list! You already emailed her the syllabus! Hell, give her the answers to the first test if she asks!
     </em>
     She shook the thoughts from her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean, I’m sure you want to get a head start this weekend. Let me print out a copy of what Nicky needs specifically for class.” She replied, trying to breathe normally, walking back to her desk.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s smile brightened if that was even possible.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you. He’s still at the age where it’s fun to drag him out and embarrass him.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio noticed that Agatha had followed her to her desk and was leaning against it, very close to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I’m sure it is. Alice and I embarrassed ourselves plenty. We didn’t need adults around to help.” She smiled up at Agatha, clicking around the desktop for the files she needed and tapping her foot slightly to the beat of the current song, trying to act natural when she realized her music had changed to a very not safe for work playlist.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s face went bright red as the lyrics rang out, “Get into my bed, girls just want to have sex.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scrambled to find the music player and turn it off. “Like right now,” she mumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “I love that playlist, though I’m partial to ‘She Calls Me Daddy’ and ‘Mommy Issues.’”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio choked on her saliva.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. Where was everyone now? She still had it. She was smooth, no tripping up for this dyke. The other day was a total fluke. Except Rio was still coughing and turning blue. Agatha looked around for the required teacher tumbler and grabbed the green metal water cup with random stickers.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knelt down and put the straw to Rio’s lips. Rio sucked down water and Agatha looked down at the tile floor. Agatha proving to herself that she could flirt harmlessly had made Rio choke.
    </p>
<p>
     That was not the kind of choking Agatha enjoyed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s coughing subsided, her eyes watery. “Thank you, I don’t know what happened.” She laughed nervously.
    </p>
<p>
     “Someone made inappropriate jokes, and you choked. I think I saw them run out of the door.” Agatha pointed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio poked her tongue in her cheek, realizing how close they had come to each other. She backed up and stood, pressing the print button. “Let’s get you those documents, shall we?”
    </p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda had lost Agatha, at SHIELD of all places.
    </p>
<p>
     They were on a specific mission to get the finalized new parent list from the front office. Wanda had stepped into the principal’s office, while the other three women waited for the list.
    </p>
<p>
     “I just need to ask Lilia a quick question about this weekend is all,” Wanda had said, before slipping into the office. She knew Agatha wouldn’t follow. Agatha spent enough time in Lilia’s office, with as much as Nicky and Tommy got into trouble during the year, always the one to smooth things over. She didn’t want to spend more time there than she had to.
    </p>
<p>
     So technically, Wanda didn’t lose Agatha, Nat, and Jen did.
    </p>
<p>
     How had three women, lost ONE award-winning actress?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda had replayed the events of the past few days for Lilia Calderu and made sure to emphasize Agatha’s insistence that she was not attracted to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia emitted a throaty laugh, “It’s about time Agatha finds someone who can truly understand her and meet her where she’s at.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you mean?” Wanda tilted her head in question.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio has a past too, they would be good for each other,” Lilia shrugged. Wanda had known Lilia since she had landed in Los Angeles all those years before and Lilia still baffled her.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia turned her eyes to the door, a gleam in her eye and a knowing smile playing at the corners of her lips. “You better go find Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s right outside the door with Jen and Nat.” Wanda furrowed her eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Lilia was a fixture at SHIELD, with many joking that she came with the building. She had secured a position right out of college and had risen to principal. She knew everything about everyone and was incredibly insightful. Many alumni, or just those who knew her, were convinced she could tell the future.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Is she?”
    </p>
<p>
     Nat and Jen rushed through the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “We lost Agatha,” Nat said first.
    </p>
<p>
     “Which normally wouldn’t be a big deal, but…” Jen trailed off.
    </p>
<p>
     The three women turned their heads to Lilia as she huffed a laugh and waved a hand, dismissing them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They left the office, Wanda in the lead. “We’ll go to Alice’s classroom first, see if she’s seen her. Then we’ll head to Rio’s,” she instructed.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda would normally not be concerned. However, Agatha had been right that this was Alice’s best friend and someone who would inevitably spend more time with all of them.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda had a plan, and she was not going to let Agatha’s abnormally high sex drive mess it up.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen snickered. “Didn’t one or both of you make a cheesy high school movie like this? You know, back when Agatha was young?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda rolled her eyes. “She’s not old now, and those were generally slasher flicks with a killer chasing us.” They turned down a hall as she looked at Nat. “Aren’t you supposed to know where we are,
     <em>
      body
     </em>
     guard?” A sly smile tugged at Wanda’s lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat glanced at Wanda as they arrived at  Alice’s classroom. “Phone tracking says she’s in the building. The building with more security than Fort Knox, I think she’ll be okay.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They walked into the familiar classroom decorated with an assortment of history, motivational, and pop-culture posters. Bookshelves around the room held the expected books and supplies as well an array of student projects from over the years, gifts from previous students, and various personal touches. Stevie Nicks came through the overhead speaker, and standing precariously on a chair, placed on top of a table, was Alice, attempting to put shades over the fluorescent lights to make the lighting less harsh.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Alice,” Wanda said as she walked in, scanning the room, “have you seen Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     “What?” Alice turned quickly as if she had forgotten her current situation. The chair toppled, and Alice came tumbling from her makeshift tower. Nat and Jen rushed forward to keep her from being seriously injured. Jen, having the longer stride as the taller of the two, caught Alice around the waist.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks,” Alice said, blushing, as Jen helped her to the ground the rest of the way. They quickly parted as Jen mumbled that it was nothing and looked at the ground. Nat and Wanda exchanged understanding and knowing looks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, yeah, she stopped by to ask where Rio’s room is,” Alice fidgeted with her clothing “I haven’t really touched base with any of you. Is Agatha into Rio?” She would add that moment with Jen to the pile of other moments with Jen. They had collected a decade of them and hadn’t done anything about it yet. What was another few decades?
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda turned, gesturing for Alice to lead the way as they headed to Rio’s room. Being in charge was something Wanda was trying to do more often, and she found it thrilling.
    </p>
<p>
     “She lies and says she’s not, that Rio’s too young and she doesn’t want a repeat of what happened before.” She explained to the younger woman as they walked down the hall.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice sighed. “Rio has a rule about not dating her students’ parents, but I know her.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen let out a sigh of relief, “Great, so we leave them alone, let them live their lives, and my job is easier.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The other women stopped right at Rio’s door and looked back at Jen as they whispered, “Not a chance.”
    </p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s skin had just returned to its natural olive state and had just handed Agatha the supply list, her school contact information, and a hard copy of the syllabus when everyone else walked in.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “There you are, Aggie!” Wanda said with a radiant smile. It looked mischievous to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Alice with a raised eyebrow but didn’t say anything. Agatha turned toward the four intruders. “I had just come down here to get more information about Nicky’s science class,” she explained.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jennifer raised an eyebrow. “Of course you did.” She turned towards Rio and extended her hand. “Jennifer Kale, I keep these two employed and in line. I also clean up after their son’s shenanigans. You can call me Jen.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio shook her hand and returned her smile. “Rio Vidal. Science. I will try to keep an eye on Nicky and Tommy. I hear Billy stays out of trouble.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen nodded. “Yes, that one took after Vision and the young Wanda. Not the two standing before you, thankfully.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda rolled her eyes and looked back at Rio. “Did Agatha tell you about tomorrow?” She asked, feigning innocence.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow in question. “What about tomorrow?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t believe you, Aggie!” Wanda smiled warmly. “Every year, we host a huge party for the teachers and parents at our beach house. We have a pool and a private beach area. We have a lot of fun, and it’s a casual way to meet the parents, with no students present, so you don’t have to worry about being in a swimsuit or drinking with kids around.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can be pretty laid back here, it’s just the general nature of the school and environment. We try to host things when we can, volunteer, chaperone, those kinds of things,” Wanda gestured with her hand as if to indicate other events. “Tony Stark tends to host several things for the larger Hollywood community, often involving the kids, and we do things for the teachers and the school.
    </p>
<p>
     “All the teachers are there, and Calderu comes. I’m surprised Alice hasn’t mentioned it yet. Anyway, it starts around seven, and Alice knows where the house is. We’d love to have you.” At some point in her very excited explanation, Wanda had put her hand on Rio’s arm, and Agatha had turned bright red with a murderous expression.
    </p>
<p>
     The other three women had moved off to the back of the room and were talking in hushed, suspicious tones.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Please come,” Wanda added, looking at Rio with big green eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t possibly tell this woman no. She glanced back at Alice, who had suddenly appeared back at her side. “If Alice usually goes, then I’m sure we’ll be there. That sounds like a great way to meet people in a less stressful environment.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice nodded, and for some reason, there were butterflies in Rio’s stomach at the thought of being at a party at Agatha’s beach house in swimwear. Rio glanced at Agatha and caught her eye. Agatha smiled slightly at Rio before turning away and returning to her more nonchalant expression.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda beamed. “Great! We’ll see you tomorrow! We’ve got to go get the boys from practice.” Wanda grabbed Agatha’s arm, and they left with their small entourage following behind them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Well, that was…something,” Rio said after a moment. “I’m ready to go home. Are you ready to go home? Let’s go home.” Without waiting for Alice, Rio started gathering her things and turned off the computer. “Wait, where’s my phone?” She asked, looking around the room.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Alice held it up. “Found it! It was on a desk.” In reality, Alice had grabbed it while Rio had been distracted by Wanda so that she, Jennifer, and Nat could program everyone’s numbers into it. Nat had pick-pocketed Agatha’s phone and programmed Rio’s number into it.
    </p>
<p>
     “And yes, I’m ready to go home. I can’t believe I forgot to tell you about the party.”
    </p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha found herself, once again, sitting in her living room, wine in hand, talking about Rio Vidal, the woman who was becoming a recurring theme in her thoughts and topic of conversation.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I can’t believe you didn’t tell her about the party tomorrow!” Wanda exclaimed from her usual seat in the corner of the couch.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha just rolled her eyes. “Alice always comes, I just assumed Rio would come with her.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Nat laughed. “Sure you did, or you were afraid to invite the pretty girl to your party and see her in a swimsuit.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha took a drink and swallowed before replying. “I am a grown woman. We had a nice conversation today, and for the last time, I am not attracted to her.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda just smirked and said, “Well, I for one think the blue shirt she wore today really brought out the green of her eyes.” She glanced at Nat and Jen to make sure they were listening for Agatha’s response.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Automatically, Agatha replied, “Her eyes are a beautiful light brown, amber if they catch the light just right, and she was wearing a black Pink Pony Club tank top since school hasn’t started.” After it was out of her mouth, she realized what had happened as her friends laughed. “I’m just very observant, okay?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Don’t make my job harder,” Jen groaned.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned back into the couch. Rio was enchanting, and Agatha believed there was nothing wrong with innocent flirting. She would not, however, go beyond that.
    </p>
<p>
     No more sleeping with teachers.

       Early August
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was going to a party at Agatha Harkness’s beach house.
    </p>
<p>
     Yes, it was for all of the faculty, staff, and parents at SHIELD, but the fact remained that Rio would be at a star-studded party at a beach house owned by Agatha Fucking Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     After leaving school on Friday, Rio had decided she needed a new swimsuit specifically for the occasion. Alice, unsurprisingly, had jumped at the idea. Saturday morning was spent getting pedicures, something they hadn’t done together in years. While Rio hadn’t lost touch with Alice, they had grown apart, not being able to discuss much with Alice’s position being what it was. Rio felt as if she was getting to know a new version of Alice, really getting to know her. Whenever they got together for holidays or breaks, they mainly discussed Rio and her drama. Rio’s school hadn’t required NDAs, although she had a few semi-famous friends who personally required them.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio still told Alice everything, NDA or not.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice however, refused to break laws. She was far more of a stickler in that regard.
    </p>
<p>
     They were very different in that way, and Rio respected that, though she didn’t like the secrets and lies. Still, it was Alice, and Rio respected her deeply held beliefs of her universally distributed sister. They both had trauma and it manifested in different ways and came with it’s own responses. Rio didn’t like lies and secrets due to her previous relationship, and Alice was very adverse to breaking contracts, laws, and unspoken agreements, due to her mother breaking the unspoken bond and agreement of motherhood.
    </p>
<p>
     It was something Alice and Rio had discussed at length.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio brought herself back to the moment, checking over herself for what must have been the fiftieth time in the floor-length mirror. The royal blue bikini she had chosen complemented her tan skin and made the gold flecks in her brown eyes stand out just right. She pulled on denim cutoffs and a black tank top, letting her collarbone-length dark hair stay down for now. She had packed a bag in order to be proactive. Alice had informed that it wasn’t unusual for people to stay at the house for the night, though Agatha and Wanda would usually have their drivers take them home. Wagatha believed in safety and was adamant that people stay if needed. Rio planned for them to come home or get an Uber, but generally kept a go-bag in her car as a habit from childhood and just freshened it up for the night. Like the scouts, Rio was always prepared.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Why do I feel like a teenager going to her first major party, Raven?” Rio asked her cat, who was observing her from her spot on the bed. Raven let out a meow in reply.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, not you too. I think the two of us could be good friends, and that’s it.” She looked at the green-eyed cat that was giving her a look. “Don’t look at me like that. Maybe you’ll meet her one day—just friends. Stop judging me like that. Besides, it’s just you and me. Well, and Alice. The last time I tried to date turned out disastrous. You never liked her, I should’ve listened.” She shook her head as she heard Alice come in.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Are you ready? Are you having deep conversations with Raven?” She asked as she walked into the bedroom and scratched the cat under the chin. “I swear this cat is going to live forever.” She turned and looked at Raven. “You better, at least.” She looked back at Rio, “You look amazing! Agatha is going to die.” She added as Raven added a meow of agreement.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “Again, no. I bought this for me, no matter what you say. You look amazing, that orange was a good choice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice wore an orange bikini, black board shorts, and a blue tank top. Her black and red hair was pulled back in a ponytail and flip-flops adorned her feet. “Let me just grab my bag, and I’ll be ready to go. Raven’s been fed.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Ten minutes later, they were on their way to the beach, bags safely in the back, and the lyrics of ‘Feminomenon’ filling the car. Rio wasn’t entirely sure why she was so nervous. It was just a massive party at Agatha Harkness and Wanda Maximoff’s beach house.
    </p>
<p>
     “They do this every year?” Rio asked, turning to Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, like Wanda said, they do all the things if they can. They are the super moms. Drew loves to do things at the elementary and middle school levels, and Tony Stark loves a good party. It just depends on the occasion. SHIELD does quite a few of events, but independent activities like this? Wagatha is usually behind it if their schedule allows.” Alice answered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head in disbelief, “I think that’s amazing, but wow. That’s a lot.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They love it. Especially Wanda. Agatha just goes along with it.” Alice added.
    </p>
<p>
     “I would not do those things for you.” Rio laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you would absolutely throw random parties for me, just not school parties.” Alice agreed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked out the windshield as they headed towards Malibu. “Why, though? They’re these huge megastars. Yes, back-to-school parties happen, but why would they do something like this, especially just for the teachers and other parents and then go over the top for other things?” She looked at Alice who was focused on the road.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice thought about it for a moment. “You know the basic Agatha Harkness back story.” She stated.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “Of course.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, recap it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Alice out of the side of her eyes but did as requested. “Agatha’s mom put her in a beauty pageant when Agatha was a baby in October 1973 at six months old, and she instantly went into commercials and then was cast in a TV show at the age of one. Boom, instant child star.” Rio started to recap. “She was cast in movies at five, and her super crazy religious mother tried to control her, no freedoms, private tutors, etc., despite the fact that she was the one who had introduced her child to Hollywood.
    </p>
<p>
     “Her mom kept her as sheltered as she could, and Agatha rebelled and was friends with all the other child stars of the time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Her mom, Evanora, was very abusive and caught Agatha making out with another star of the time, and outed her, thinking it would ruin Agatha, and it didn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “The crazy bitch then tried to shoot her in public in the eighties and missed. Agatha filed to be emancipated from her mother at sixteen and won, becoming America’s lesbian sweetheart in 1989. She went on to get her high school degree that year and graduated from college, but never had an actual school, childhood, or parental experience.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then, Wanda was dumped in Hollywood in 1994 after her family was killed in the war in Sokovia, and Agatha took her under her wing. Something about Wanda’s aunt was a producer on Agatha's new show, and they cast Wanda as the younger sister.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “So far, yes. It was Sisters, by the way. I love that show.” Alice chimed in.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “We can quote that show,” Rio replied. They still watched it, even if it was nearly 30 years old. Rio and Alice watched it as a comfort show, even though it had ended in 2001.
    </p>
<p>
     “So Agatha took Wanda under her wing, and in 1995, things with the aunt went south, and Agatha basically took her in like a sister, and we see where that ended up,” Rio concluded.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice nodded her head. Those were all the basics Rio needed to know for now. Alice knew a few additional details more, but Agatha always seemed to provide more details when Alice thought she had known all there was to know. And Lilia mainly told Alice things about Alice’s mother.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could fill in any more nitty-gritty details from there when she was ready. That could be part of their bonding and eventual love story. Alice knew Rio had her own nitty-gritty back story to share with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right. They met Nat in 1997, that’s not my story to share, though. They, like us, are a found family with many traditions. We’re all phoenixes. Jen and Lilia even fit into the puzzle along the way, and so did I. We were all covenless witches at one point, and Agatha refers to the group as the coven, we all do.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha and Wanda wanted to make sure their kids had great memories and wanted to give back to the places they found homes in.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio took in her friend's words and looked at her for a long moment. “You really have kept so much from me,” she stated, pieces of a puzzle falling into place. Alice shrugged “I signed several NDAs, and they were covered under that umbrella, Rio. My hands were tied.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked down at her lap. This was Alice, the only family she had left. She couldn’t be mad at her. Not really. She understood, it just hurt. She had told Alice everything about her friends in San Francisco and Rio had also signed an NDA.
    </p>
<p>
     She pushed that all aside, determined not to ruin the night.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell me about Jen,” Rio changed the subject with a knowing smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s cheeks pinkened as she seemed to focus even more on the road, if it was even possible. “What do you mean? She’s a friend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I saw how you looked at her yesterday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice shook her head. “It’s nothing, we’re just friends. We both moved out here about the same time, and I wouldn’t want to lose that friendship.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “Oh good, because she’s really cute and I was thinking I would —”
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t say you could make a move.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s what I thought.” Rio picked a new song to play, and they drove the last few minutes in a comfortable silence.
    </p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
     Everything was perfectly set up: the food, the bar, and the music. Agatha was wearing a simple black high-waisted two-piece with a white open-front cover-up monogrammed with a purple monogrammed A.H.. Wanda stood beside her in a black and white one-piece and a matching cover-up with a scarlet monogrammed W.M.
    </p>
<p>
     They were never beating those couple of allegations.
    </p>
<p>
     “Relax, Alice texted me. They’re on their way.” Wanda put a comforting hand on Agatha’s arm, noticing how tense her best friend was.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know what you mean,” Agatha replied, her shoulders automatically relaxing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure you don’t.” Wanda teased.
    </p>
<p>
     Natasha stepped up next to them wearing a black tank top and shorts with a red one-piece underneath. She was on duty, as evidenced by her earpiece, but the swimsuit made sense. “Making a move tonight, Aggie?” She said with a slight smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re all terrible friends,” Agatha pouted as Jen joined the group in her pink swim shorts and halter top.
    </p>
<p>
     “This event is too public for you to do anything anyway.” Jen nodded in agreement.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda’s shoulders sagged. “Must you take the fun out of everything, Jen?”
    </p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes widened as they drove through the gate and up to the Malibu beach house. Alice ignored the man who directed her where to park and chose a place of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just leave your bag here and bring your phone for now,” Alice instructed with a smile as she climbed down from her Jeep.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked up at the massive beach house that was more like a beach mansion.
    </p>
<p>
     She followed Alice up the few steps to the double doors, and they walked straight into the open-concept house, seeing straight to the back of the house, which was entirely glass.
    </p>
<p>
     The back doors were open, leading out to where the pool was, and beyond that, a path led to the beach. Rio’s eyes landed automatically on Agatha, who was talking to Coach Rogers. She was headed towards her when someone grabbed her arm and spun her around. Rio found herself face to face with her boss, Lilia Calderu, wearing a classy one-piece with a wrap-around skirt.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, I’m glad you’re here. This is the perfect time to get to know the parents, especially some of the very well-known, award-winning ones. Have a lovely time.” Lilia smiled at her warmly and slipped back into the growing crowd. Rio stared at the spot where she had been with a baffled look on her face as Alice took her arm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Remember, the woman knows more than we do and speaks in riddles.” Alice handed her a drink. “Here, now go talk.” Rio nodded and turned to where Agatha had been prior. She wasn’t sure why that was the first person she wanted to talk to, Rio just felt drawn to the older woman. Instead, she found herself in conversation with Pepper Potts-Stark and Drew Barrymore.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m so glad you came, I was telling Agatha about you when we were filming the other day,” Drew had a hand on Rio’s arm, drawing circles on it with her thumb.
    </p>
<p>
     Pepper had an eyebrow raised and a smirk on her face. As a waiter walked by, she took Rio’s empty drink from her and replaced it with a full one.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at the older blonde woman thankfully. She had a feeling that she and Pepper would be good friends.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh? About what exactly?” Rio managed to get out. Why was Drew Barrymore having a conversation about her?
    </p>
<p>
     Drew smiled widely. “I had read about you in the welcome back email and told our dear Aggie that she needed to brush up on her science is all,” she said with a wink.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was going to melt. Drew Barrymore was trying to set her up with Agatha Harkness. LA truly was lesbian heaven.
    </p>
<p>
     Pepper put a hand on Drew’s arm. “Drew, you’re going to cause her to short-circuit.” Pepper laughed and changed the subject. “Alice has told us great things about you. I’m sure Morgan will love your class.”
    </p>
<p>
     They chatted a little longer before Rio stepped away, their numbers added to her phone. She didn’t need Drew’s number necessarily, however, Drew insisted.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio smiled and blew air out of her nose with a small smile upon seeing Agatha’s number with a purple heart next to it.
     <em>
      Devils,
     </em>
     she thought.
    </p>
<p>
     The inside of the house was becoming rather crowded, and the sun was beginning to set outside. Rio took that as a sign and excused herself from the group of English teachers she was speaking to. Rio found English teachers to be the most dramatic group on any campus, and this group was already living up to that reputation. Rio slipped out the back door, picked up her third drink of the night, walked past the pool, and down the stairs and the short path to the private beach, surprised that it was empty.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat in one of the beach chairs in the sand and took in the relative quiet, the muted sounds of the party behind her and the waves in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio removed her sandals, set them to the side, and let her toes dig into the sand. She leaned back and took in the pink and orange hues of the sunset, the light breeze slipped over her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a beautiful view and something she hoped she would get to do again.
     <em>
      Maybe next year,
     </em>
     she thought.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been another beach house once, but it hadn’t been nearly as peaceful. This was peaceful, and comforting, a place that spoke of family and memories.
    </p>
<p>
     She was lost in her thoughts and the scenery when she heard the unmistakable and familiar voice of Agatha Harkness behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve always said the sunset is the universe’s way of celebrating lesbianism,” Agatha said as she sat down in the chair next to Rio, drink in hand. “Is it okay if I join you? I can leave if you want to continue enjoying the peace and Mother Nature’s lesbianism. I know the party gets pretty crowded and overwhelming.” She added.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “It’s your house, pretty sure you’re allowed to sit where you want. Thank you for asking and not assuming though. Very polite of you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have been told I’m rather polite for Hollywood elite.” She retorted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t get ahead of yourself there, Harkness. Don’t want to inflate your ego too much.” Rio was shocked at herself. Apparently, all it took was three incredibly strong drinks and she could banter back and forth with Agatha Fucking Harkness.
     <em>
      Wonder if I can drink at work,
     </em>
     she considered.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think the awards have already done that job.” She laughed and snorted, causing her to turn bright red.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled reflexively upon hearing Agatha’s snort. It was something that she had always found charming about the actress in interviews and her acting. It was something that seemed genuine. “I love your laugh. That snort is adorable.”
     <em>
      Fuck, Vidal,
     </em>
     she thought as a blush spread across her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     The two women sat there in embarrassed silence without looking at each other.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was the first to break the silence between them. “Do you spend time here often? The sunset is beautiful here. Everything is really.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a drink and nodded. “It depends on our schedules and life. We begin and end our summer here and try to spend time here during the summer. Girls’ weekends when we can, it’s a nice little getaway. We also have Wanda’s cabin in Lake Tahoe, and our apartment in New York. The New York apartment doubles for work, of course.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, that’s taking U-Hauling to a new level.” Rio immediately slapped a hand over her mouth. “I’m going to go drown myself in the ocean.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed and snorted again, before groaning. “I’ll join you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not completely wrong, though. It does look like that. Wanda is my family. When we found each other, it became an older-younger sibling situation. It made sense to buy property together and share it that way. We didn’t both need our own. Our houses are even on a compound of sorts. I’m sure Alice told you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Agatha, mouth slightly agape. Agatha and Wanda lived on the same piece of land, too? “She most certainly did not! I just found out she knew you both this week.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “Right, NDAs.” Agatha ran her hand through her elbow-length hair. “It’s public knowledge that we’re neighbors. What’s not as commonly known is that it’s actually a very large enclosed piece of land. Her house is on one side, mine is on the other, and the original house is in the middle. The boys now hang out in that middle house, we call it the Clubhouse. We have driveways that connect them. There are what goes for woods in LA, towards the back, and space to build more houses if we wanted to. I bought the land when I turned eighteen, back when there was still a lot of land on what was the outskirts of LA at the time. Now there’s a housing development across the street.” She laughed before continuing, “Nat lives next to us, even though she could live on the property if she weren’t so hardheaded.
    </p>
<p>
     “With us being so close, Wanda and I are somewhat codependent, and we realize that. It’s not in a toxic way, more in the way that we’ve experienced trauma, and we’re each other’s security blankets. Obviously, we can go places without each other. We’re not that bad. But knowing that your sister is right there unless she’s off filming somewhere? It’s priceless. I imagine it’s the same for you and Alice from what she has said?” Agatha was looking directly at Rio, waiting for her response.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. She had never expected to have such an easy conversation with this woman. “Yes. She’s all I have, family-wise. We’ve lived together before, and we used to be extremely close. Being in different cities for so long was excruciating, and with the confidentiality, we didn’t know everything about each other anymore. So being neighbors and working together again has already been amazing.” Rio enjoyed talking to Agatha. It was as if this weren’t their third actual conversation, ever.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s smile softened. “I know keeping things from those you love can be extremely difficult. We share so much, especially since we are very much one big family. We share the private jets. We got to a point where we couldn’t fly commercially a long time ago. The security team, styling team, domestic teams, and a few vehicles- that’s all shared. Except favorite cars, those are personally owned, Vision is absolutely hers, my flings are mine, for a few hours at least, and the boys, well, we all have a hand in raising them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe one day we’ll split things, maybe one day we’ll split the compound, maybe we won’t. If people want to think we’re a couple or think we have a polyamorous thing going on, it’s fine. This family works for us, and I love it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio exhaled in wonder. “That all sounds amazing. Raising your kids together, and being right there when you need each other?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is pretty great.” Agatha agreed.
    </p>
<p>
     The Agatha image that the media portrayed was not the side of Agatha that Rio was seeing now. Yes, she could be flirty like that public persona, Rio had seen that firsthand. However, she was attentive and caring. The media made it seem as though she were all sarcasm, wit, and sexuality unless it came to parenting or her activism. However, Agatha was very focused on her inner circle, which included more than just Nicky. She had built a chosen family, was kind, offered women water when they were choking, and enjoyed watching sunsets. Agatha Harkness even had awkward moments and slipped up. Rio was looking forward to getting to know more about this woman.
    </p>
<p>
     As they talked after the sun went down and the moon had come up, Wanda and Alice looked on from the balcony of the beach house.
    </p>
<p>
     “Friends to idiots to lovers?” Alice asked, watching as Rio laughed at something that Agatha said and put a hand on Agatha’s bare arm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep,” Wanda said, popping the p.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen stepped up next to Alice, careful not to brush up against her, but giving her a warm smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat sidled up next to Wanda, quickly taking her hand and squeezing it, before letting it go as if nothing had happened.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen and Nat’s eyes automatically caught what the other two had been looking at.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen sighed. Apparently, she was now an accomplice to this. “Slow burn?” She added.
    </p>
<p>
     “Unfortunately.” Alice and Wanda said in unison.
    </p>
<p>
     “Angst and drama because they’re afraid of their feelings and being hurt in the process,” Lilia added, stepping forth from the shadows. The four younger women just nodded. Completely unsurprised by her appearance.
    </p>
<p>
     “...and we will be here to push all the way,” Nat added, looking at Wanda expectantly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda nodded and turned to Jen, ready to begin her plan. “At ten, you and Alice will leave in Alice’s Jeep, which is why I made you ride with us. I don’t care where you go.” In her head, she was screaming ‘one of your places, idiots’, but she didn’t voice it. If she could successfully matchmake two couples, she’d be thrilled. “You’ll leave Rio’s bag here. I’ll text Agatha saying you both left. Knowing Agatha, she’ll offer to either take Rio home or back to the compound to continue their conversation. Since Nat came in a different vehicle tonight, I’ll have Nat take me home.” Wanda grinned. She loved when her plans came together.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen huffed a laugh and looked at Wanda fondly. “Got it, boss.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen and Alice went back to the party, and Nat returned to do her job, fingertips lightly brushing Wanda’s arm as she departed.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda’s eyes trailed after the other redhead, Lilia carefully watching both of them.
    </p>
<p>
     The older woman turned toward Wanda. “Sometimes we do what we think is right, even though it is not what we want. You might be hurting someone by doing the ‘right’ thing. Times have changed.” She left before Wanda could respond. Wanda shook her head.
     <em>
      She’s right and you know it, Maximoff.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
     The stars twinkled in the sky and the sounds of the party filtered out of the house behind them. Agatha found it odd that no one else had wandered down to the beach and she had a feeling that was the doing of one Natasha Romanov and would have to thank her for it later. She enjoyed having this time to talk, uninterrupted, with Rio. The younger woman made Agatha really laugh, something few were able to do, and was easy to talk to.
    </p>
<p>
     The two women had abandoned their chairs and were sitting on a beach blanket, sides pressed together so they could hear each other over the sounds of the ocean and the party.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a natural lull in the conversation, and Agatha’s eyes had locked on Rio’s, when they dropped to Rio’s plump pink lips.
    </p>
<p>
     The tip of Agatha’s tongue swept over her own lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn’t sure if it was the alcohol, the ocean, the moon, or that shooting star, but she was extremely tempted to lean forward and find out if Rio’s lips were as soft as they looked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cleared her throat, and Agatha’s eyes darted back up to meet hers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” Rio said, voice wavering.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio looked into Agatha’s sapphire blue eyes that reflected the stars. Agatha had been staring at her, and Rio had thought about kissing her.
    </p>
<p>
     No, that was not something Rio could do. Agatha was a parent, and that was a boundary Rio had drawn. It was a mixture of the alcohol, the setting, and her silly childhood crush.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can be your friend.” She said.
     <em>
      Idiot. You’re an idiot.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s smile reached her eyes. “I’d like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Something in Rio was relieved. She was worried she would cause offense or that Agatha would laugh and tell her that she was only here to add Rio to her CVS receipt length list of women.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s smile was bright. She did her best to mimic a teenage girl, “OMG! Wait until I tell my friends that I’m friends with Agatha Harkness!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smacked her on the arm, mood ruined. “You’re a child.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded enthusiastically. “You were almost an EGOT winner when I was born.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. Picking up her phone as it vibrated, notifying her of a text. “Oh wow, we’ve been down here awhile.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “I’m amazing company.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pretended to ignore her as she suppressed a smile and read the text from Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      SuperStar Wanda:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
     Alice and Jen left together!! In Alice’s car.
    </p>
<p>
     Here’s hoping they finally get their act together.
    </p>
<p>
     She left Rio’s bag though. MAKE A MOVE.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s phone went off next, to a text from Alice.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Sister Alice
     </b>
</p>
<p>
     Taking Jen home…not sure if to mine or hers,

    </p>
<p>
     Ask Agatha to take you home. You know, to
    </p>
<p>
     her house.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio and Agatha looked back up at each other. Rio spoke first. “Did you know that Jen and Alice were into each other?” She asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha just looked at her. “You didn’t?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed. “I didn’t even know Jen existed until this week, NDAs, remember?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put a comforting hand on Rio’s knee, their sides still touching. They had decided to be friends, hadn’t kissed, yet hadn’t parted either.
    </p>
<p>
     This was not lost on Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha flashed an Oscar-winning smile. “Would you like to go back to my place? As friends, of course.”

      “Angel, did you change the lyrics and gender-bend them?” Agatha raised an eyebrow at Wanda.

<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stood up from the sand in one fluid motion, without using her hands, in only a way Agatha Fucking Harkness could, and held out a hand to help Rio, which she gladly took.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t mind leaving your party early?” Rio asked, noting that it was far from dying down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, gods no. I usually leave before midnight anyway. It’s not about me and I prefer smaller affairs anyway, I’m getting too old for these big to-dos. I only stay out late for the awards after parties because it’s almost required.” Agatha tugged Rio to her feet and picked up their empty glasses. Agatha led them up the beach to the side of the house where a car was waiting, handed the glasses to one of the security guys, and nodded. “Pizza and movies?” Agatha asked, gesturing for Rio to get into the large black SUV first.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “I said let’s be friends and you’re asking me to Netflix and chill? Isn’t that a little outdated Harkness?” She asked with a bemused smile. Noting that her bag was in the car, surely Wanda’s doing.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes as the door closed behind them. “Trust me, if I was you up for nefarious reasons, you would know. I’m serious. And, as you don’t sleep with parents, I don’t sleep with my son’s teachers,” she thought for a moment. “anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “Ah, one of Hollywood’s bad boys cleaning up her act? For moi?” She replied, batting her eyelashes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Sure, that’s why.” In reality, no one else interested her, but she wasn’t telling Rio that. “What kind of pizza do you want? I’m ordering now so it should be there when we arrive.” She asked, changing the subject. If they were doing this whole friend thing, she needed to shelve this line of talk.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Veggie please, if that’s okay. Is Nicky home?” Rio asked. She hadn’t seen him much and wondered if he was doing something with his de facto cousins. She hadn’t even met Vision yet. She didn’t think she’d meet him now, but was starting to wonder if he existed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Veggie it is, and all three boys are with Vision having a horror movie marathon at the Clubhouse I was telling you about. The boys could stay by themselves, but they’re getting to the age where we wouldn’t put it past them to throw their own party, and we’re not quite ready for that. So, adult supervision it is. Billy wouldn’t, but the other two absolutely would.” She smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked out the window, watching the ocean pass them as they headed back towards the city. “What’s it like? Knowing everyone knows so much about you?” She asked without thinking, automatically realizing how invasive the question was. “Oh no! Don’t answer that.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha regarded her for a second, thinking about her response.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s okay, no one outside of an interview has ever asked me that before, and interviewers never want the real answer, a completely honest answer. It seems like the entire world knows everything about me, but it’s only what I want them to know.
    </p>
<p>
     “When my mother outed me in 1989, stripping my life bare for all to see and in turn exposing herself for who she really was, I was taught to curate a certain image.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, the public sees the dedicated mom, activist, trailblazer, ‘bad boy’ persona—because that’s what I want them to see. Just like I only show the parts of my personal life that I want to show.” Agatha chose her words carefully. She felt like she could tell Rio a lot, but she didn’t want to give just anything away. Agatha had layers and she never just stripped herself raw. She had done that once before and refused to do it again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Information leaks, it always does. That’s why I have Jen and Nat. It’s why I send Nicky to a school with ironclad NDAs run by a woman I have known forever and trust. As a testament to how well it all works, Alice is a close friend of mine and has been a decade, and you had no idea.” Agatha watched Rio process and mull over everything she had just said before plowing on.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you know what you’re doing, know the right people, and play your cards right, then Hollywood can be both very public and extremely private at the same time. We have learned to control the narrative, and while our lives are on display, it’s the show we want people to see, and we take comfort in that.
    </p>
<p>
     “People will believe what they want to believe, but we can steer them in the direction of what we want them to believe. Few people know what really goes on behind these walls and that’s why I bought this land and enclosed it. So my family, chosen and otherwise, had an escape. A place we could be our authentic selves.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ll start to learn that there are things about me you don’t know and you can decide for yourself if that’s a good or a bad thing.” Agatha kept her eyes locked on Rio. This was not a speech she often gave to people, it was not something she really ever told anyone. The last time she had broken down how curated her life was, was to Alice. That had been out of necessity, and she felt like this was too.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew that Rio was important to Alice, and Alice was important to Agatha, whether Alice believed it or not. Alice was Lorna’s daughter, and Agatha had made a promise to Lorna.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Rio took everything in and processed it. She wasn’t completely surprised that there was a hidden side to Agatha and that she carefully revealed what people knew about her. Rio had read about what had happened to her when she was outed and could see why Agatha had been advised to live the way she did.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio remembered Alice’s mother, Lorna, being an open book to the public, but keeping Alice hidden from view and out of the public eye. Rio knew double lives were possible, though Lorna didn’t really have a double life in as much as she had a mother who was willing to raise the daughter she rarely saw.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio realized that the more she learned about Agatha Harkness, the more of a mystery she became.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
     The large vehicle drove through the automatic gate and to the left, snaking around a driveway and coming to a stop in front of a large house that Rio assumed belonged to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped out first, offering her hand to Rio, who stepped out, slung her bag over her shoulder, and stopped abruptly when she saw the house before her.
    </p>
<p>
     For the second time that night, Rio was amazed by the beauty and architecture of a house.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The house was composed of glass and stone. A mix of modern and a hidden witch’s cottage. Rio chuckled. “Never beating those witch allegations Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     They walked through the covered porch and in the double doors, the smell of pizza in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “Maybe I don’t want to. I like my vampire glass witch cottage thank you,” Agatha glanced over her shoulder to see if Rio caught the reference.
    </p>
<p>
     The younger woman laughed. “Surrounded by the trees, it does look like that. When did you have it built?” Rio followed Agatha through the foyer and into the living room. Three plush black couches surrounded a large dark wooden coffee table. A large TV was mounted on a wall surrounded by built-in shelves with pictures, books, and various decor items. The back wall was completely glass with a door that led out to a pool, which was lit and had various lights hanging in the patio area. The kitchen was open concept like the beach house, and was Rio’s dream kitchen. There was a bar directly behind the center couch. Someone could cook, fetch something, whatever was needed, and still be a part of whatever was happening in the main room. There were stairs back in the foyer, and she thought they had passed a bathroom. She was just realizing she was still in her bikini and shorts.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had gone to the kitchen and was getting something out of the fridge. Also still in her bikini and monogrammed cover-up. “Let me think, I bought the land in ‘91, and Wanda and I built the clubhouse in ‘97. She built her house in 2005 when she and Vision got married, and I started building mine around the time I decided to have Nicky and it was completed in ‘08.” She walked into the living room carrying the pizza box, a bottle of wine, and two glasses.
    </p>
<p>
     “Impressive. That’s quite a history lesson. Before we eat, where’s the bathroom? I should change out of this swimsuit.” She asked.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha looked down at herself and laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I completely forgot. When you’re so used to wearing whatever people tell you to, you just go with it.” In reality, Agatha had been admiring Rio’s current attire. Friends could appreciate the scenery. “It’s back down the hall, on the left. I should probably change too.” Agatha set everything down and followed Rio, before disappearing up the stairs.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It wasn’t long before they were seated on the couch, Rio in forest green shorts and a Stanford Basketball tank top, Agatha in black yoga pants, and a purple SHIELD football mom shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had turned the music on for background noise, a nineties playlist Wanda had made. Agatha knew it had to be safe if Wanda had made it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Aren’t you cute in your mom shirt?” Rio smirked, finishing her second slice of pizza in about as many minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Has anyone told you that you eat like a teenage boy?” Agatha responded, still eating her first slice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Only everyone I’ve ever met.” Rio sipped her wine. “It’s a habit left over from how I grew up.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Sounds like there’s a story there. How did you meet Alice? You know a lot about my background, what’s the Rio Vidal story?” Agatha asked, taking another slice of pizza. Agatha knew some of Rio’s story, but wanted to hear it from the source.
    </p>
<p>
     They sat on the center couch, the same way she and Wanda often did. Her tucked in one corner, Rio tucked in the other, facing each other. It felt natural, even if they were new friends.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     “Well,” Rio started, biting her lip, thinking about how much she wanted to divulge, and then sighing. Might as well go all in, no telling what Alice had already shared. “My parents moved to San Francisco when I was 12. We moved around a lot and didn’t live in the best places. They weren’t the best people. It was my biological mom, she was great until my first stepdad left when I was about five. That’s when she started dating the wrong people. I never knew my dad. Anyway, she and my then stepdad, number six I think?” She scoffed. “I started at a new middle school, an extremely awkward age to start over with no friends and very little anything. I met Alice on the first day I was there. She was standing off to the side judging people like you do at that age, and I awkwardly stood next to her and made a comment about the group she was watching. Our preteen surliness was a match made in melodramatic heaven.
    </p>
<p>
     “We had several advanced classes together and we would work together on our projects. After a few weeks, I missed the bus home one afternoon. When I told her the neighborhood I lived in, she insisted that she walk me home. When we reached the door, we heard gunshots in my apartment. She dragged me back to her Gran’s house and refused to let me go back to my apartment. She and Gran insisted I stay the night, especially since my mom didn’t pick up the phone when I called.
    </p>
<p>
     “When I finally got through to my mom, they were both fine. They had made someone upset and what we had heard were warning shots.” Rio smiled slightly at the memory and looked up at Agatha. “You were friends with Lorna, right? So you knew her mom, Norma?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded and Rio continued, “Well, imagine how pissed Norma Wu was when she found out about my home life. From then on, I spent most of my time there, and by the time I was fourteen, I had my own room and lived there ninety-five percent of the time. It got to where she was the one school called, she was my emergency contact. Gran finished raising me. I was shocked when I saw a picture one day and realized that Lorna Wu was Alice’s mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “Anytime I did go home, it wasn’t a good time. My parents basically forgot I existed unless they needed my help with something illegal, and as much as Gran tried to fight them, they had legal rights. When I went back to Gran’s, it was with marks, bruises, burns, and so much trauma.
    </p>
<p>
     “They really didn’t care where I was, as long as I was there whenever they needed me for whatever illegal activity or scheme required a pretty young girl. They finally died at the beginning of my senior year of high school. I had recently returned from a short stint with them, things had gone terribly south, there was a lot of yelling when I was finally able to sneak out and run back home.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wasn’t there long when the police showed up and told me they had died. I stayed with Gran and Alice, and as terrible as it sounds, a weight was lifted. Gran seemed a lot less worried after that too.
    </p>
<p>
     “We both went to Stanford, something we worked so hard for. While teaching is not the most glorious thing we could do with our lives, it was something that allowed us to give back. Alice wanted to do something, not simple, but normal. Civilian, as she called it, and I think Lorna put it into her head when she was young. I’ve just always loved learning and sharing knowledge. So that’s what we did. We also wanted to make Gran proud of us, and we did.” Rio looked back at Agatha, whose eyes were red and watery. “Agatha, please don’t cry, we all have our past.”
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha knew how much the past affected Alice,  and how much Rio meant to her. Agatha also knew details that Rio would never be privy to.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to wrap her arms around Rio and hold her, to try and take the pain away. She wanted to cradle this woman’s head to her chest and hold her there.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she put a hand on Rio’s shoulder. “I am so sorry you had such a rough start and had to go through all that.” Agatha’s eyes took in the lines and light wrinkles in Rio’s face. Memorizing every detail. “I can’t believe parents would do things like that to their children. I mean, my mother did, but she was a very special case. I am so glad Norma was there for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s breath caught at the way Agatha’s eyes were taking her in. “Agatha, it’s fine, I’ve done a lot of therapy since then.” Rio looked away and tucked her hair behind her ear. “Thank you though. Norma Wu was an amazing woman and I loved her like she was my Mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dropped her hand from Rio’s shoulder, letting her fingertips trail down Rio’s arm, and moved back slightly. “That makes sense as to why you were there those times I came to see Lorna, and at the funeral.” Agatha also remembered seeing an ‘R’ on the door of the room next to Alice’s door with the ‘A’ on it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nearly choked, something Agatha was becoming good at making her do. “You remember that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You looked like you were going to kill me. Yes, I remember. If anyone asks, I do not remember, as I very pointedly told everyone I did not, did you ever tell Alice what happened?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Which time?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Either one.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “That I caught you sneaking out of her mother’s room? No. I did tell her I thought the two of you were a thing and she assured me you weren’t. I believe her now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “We very much were not. I was just there to get her to come back and finish shooting, then I got her into rehab.” It was the lie that Agatha always told.
    </p>
<p>
     “She never did outrun her demons. Alice doesn’t blame you though, and neither do I.” Rio added.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart clenched. Rio still didn’t know, and it wasn’t Agatha’s place to tell her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I know,” Agatha assured her. “Come with me, I want to show you something.” She said, standing and picking up the now-empty pizza box and the empty bottle of wine.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio rose up to follow her as Agatha led through the kitchen first, disposing of the empty containers, and then back to the front of the house into what Rio assumed was an office.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is my Harkness brag room,” Agatha turned on the light.
    </p>
<p>
     “How humble of you,” Rio smirked, noting that she was wrong about the office. Her breath caught as she took in the cases full of different awards, the memorabilia from different shows and movies Agatha had been in, pictures of her with other celebrities, trophies, and medals Nicky had won, various pictures of him, her, Wanda, and Nat. There were so many memories captured around the giant room.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t about bragging per se, it was about preserving precious memories, like a living time capsule. Rio walked around various set pieces, even costumes encased in glass. “This is amazing. I can’t believe they let you keep some of this stuff.” She came to one piece in particular and squealed. “THE COAT! From Witches Road! I thought it was destroyed!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, that was a backup. This one is the original, with all of the details and everything. I even have Lorna’s jacket from the movie.” She nodded to another case.
    </p>
<p>
     “You two were close.” The younger woman stated, looking at a picture from that night at The Oscars.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     “She was one of my mentors.” Agatha lowered her voice, measuring her words carefully. “Of course, we were. I was in the ambulance that night, I held her hand as she…I promised I would watch over Alice.” She looked away as a tear fell.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, it was Rio’s turn to be the comforter.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you didn’t. Lorna knew what she was doing. That movie consumed her, it happens to some of the best actors and you did everything you could.” Rio stepped back as Agatha gave her a watery smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are you so easy to bare my soul too?” Agatha asked, wiping a tear away with her thumb.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I’m secretly a soul-stealing witch,” Rio replied with a tooth-baring smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha huffed a laugh and pointed out a few more set pieces and several pictures.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio took in the many pictures from various decades. She noted that Lorna was in many of them, and of course, Agatha and Wanda were constantly paired together. The room was a large, living, breathing time capsule, and Rio was fascinated.
    </p>
<p>
     Pictures from the opening nights of Rent and Wicked, the premier of Frozen and Frozen II, Agatha having played Elsa.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you tell me anything about Frozen III?” Rio quirked a brow.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ran tongue along the inside of her bottom lip. “I cannot.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio huffed. “Fine, want to play a game to Frozen?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The morning sun was warm on Rio’s face as she rubbed her eyes. She blinked multiple times, trying to get her bearings. Rio had suggested a drinking game to Frozen, as you do at thirty-five and fifty-one.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had learned that Agatha Harkness did not back down from a challenge.
    </p>
<p>
     The game was simple. Drink every time there was queer subtext.
    </p>
<p>
     They had to switch to water rather quickly and then continued talking through Frozen II.
    </p>
<p>
     Watching Agatha Harkness movies with Agatha Harkness was enlightening, especially when Wanda was in them. Wanda played Anna in the movie, given their connection, and Agatha told multiple stories about the recording and artistry.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio looked around her as she gathered her thoughts. She was lying on the couch opposite the glass wall. Agatha was still asleep on the center couch, face buried in her arms. Rio grabbed her phone, noticing that it was seven and past her cat’s scheduled breakfast time. Rio was many things and a crazy cat lady was one of them. Not wanting to wake Agatha and having received zero texts from Alice, she thought about who else she could text for a ride home. Rio didn’t know many people here yet. She had however gotten the impression that she was being welcomed into this group of women, and of that group, Nat was the most likely to be awake. Considering meddling had happened to get Agatha’s number into her phone, she probably had everyone’s number. Rio opened a new message and typed in a few letters when the contact appeared.
     <em>

</p>
<p>
     Rio let out a sigh and found her bag. She went to the bathroom, to freshen up and slip her shoes on. Nat had disarmed the alarm remotely and Rio stepped out of the house right as the petite bodyguard pulled up in a red SUV. The younger woman put her bag in the backseat and climbed in the front. Nat handed her Tylenol and pointed to the coffee.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thought you would need these.” She smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Rio grumbled as she took the Tylenol and chased it with the coffee. “Any word from Alice and Jen?”
    </p>
<p>
     Nat shook her head. “No, we’ve been waiting for them to pull that trigger for years now. At least they actually stayed the night though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just chuckled. “Creeper.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is my job to know where everyone is,” she replied.
    </p>
<p>
     “Which is why I didn’t bother giving you my address.” She looked over at the redhead.
    </p>
<p>
     “You live in the same building as Alice, so I don’t need it anyway, but you’re right. I assume you talked, drank, and that’s it?” Nat asked, keeping her eyes on the road, although there was no traffic to speak of early on a Sunday morning.
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly. You can report that back to the Meddling Bitches group chat.” Rio took another sip of her coffee.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a good name for it, actually. You know Agatha will report everything to Wanda anyway.”.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I know she will.” Rio had gathered that Agatha told Wanda everything. “How did you join up with Wanda and Agatha? I know the ‘met at a club in New York’ story, but I have a feeling there’s more to it. I know you’ve been with them almost as long as they’ve known each other.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nat raised an eyebrow. “Fast learner. Well, you know I’m from Russia, that’s not hard to gather, the Romanov is a dead giveaway, and I still have the slightest accent on certain words. Would you believe me if I told you I was a very young assassin?” Nat looked at Rio from the corner of her eye to gauge Rio’s response.
    </p>
<p>
     The response was laughter as Rio looked at her. “Oh please, I mean, I had heard the rumors, but…” She noticed that Nat was not laughing. “Wait, it’s true? You actually were sent by Agatha’s mom to kill her before she died in prison?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure was.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But how?” She was flabbergasted at this point. What the hell kind of people had she become friends with?
    </p>
<p>
     “Turns out Agatha Harkness and Wanda Maximoff are not the type of people you want to meet in a dark alley. Assassin or not. It’s a longer story, but basically, Agatha punched me in the face, Wanda stepped on my throat, which was surprisingly pleasant...but anyway, Agatha made me an offer to be on her security team, some legal stuff happened, and the rest is history.” She shrugged as they pulled up to Rio’s building.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat back, “So Agatha just collects people like Infinity Stones?” She asked.
    </p>
<p>
     The other woman nodded. “Women that need a family, yes.” Don’t forget to text Agatha so she doesn’t wake up and freak out that you’re gone.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio walked into her apartment to one very angry cat.
    </p>

     “Okay, okay, I’m sorry. Let me put my bag down.” It took her longer than usual to feed Raven due to the self-appointed queen getting under her feet, jumping on the counter, and yelling at her in her way. “You better hope I never start dating anyone and sleep over at their house you freeloader.” She said as she put her bowl down. She pulled out her phone and texted Agatha.

      Me

</p>
<p>
     Sorry for leaving without a word
    </p>
<p>
     this morning. Had to get home to
    </p>
<p>
     feed the cat. Nat gave me a ride.
    </p>
<p>
     She was hired to kill you?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio assumed she’d hear from her later and knew Alice would just come over. She had a lot to process but needed to shower first.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had woken up, read Rio’s text, and taken a shower. It was too early to formulate words. What ungodly hour had that woman gotten up at? The time stamp said eight, who did those things on a weekend? In Agatha’s mind, that constituted as a red flag.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned against the counter, coffee mug raised to her lips, as she ran through what to text back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry for crying on you? No. Desperate.” Agatha sipped on her coffee but didn’t put it down as she stared at the phone, thumb hovering over the letters of the touchscreen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Glad we got drunk together? Yeah, absolutely not, Harkness, this is not the early aughts.” She took a long drink of her coffee and sat the mug on the counter, holding the phone with two hands now.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was in her fifties, she knew how to communicate with women.
    </p>
<p>
     It was literally part of what gave her her reputation.
    </p>

<p>
     we got to hang out!
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Okay, that wasn’t too bad, maybe a little overly enthusiastic. Agatha found that she wasn’t completely in control of herself around Rio. A fluke, really.

     Thanks, I enjoyed it. Can’t wait to do it again.

</p>
<p>
     Agatha had noticed the green heart those wenches she called friends had put next to Rio's name and decided to leave it. At least she hadn’t scared Rio off, yet. So far, the friends thing was going well and she knew it was just a matter of time before Wanda ran in to demand to hear everything unless she had already talked to Natasha. Wanda would still want to hear everything directly from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     As if summoned by her thoughts, Wanda ran through the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn’t bothered resetting the alarm, which would have been useless, as Wanda could deactivate it from her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Get in here and tell me everything,” Wanda demanded, launching herself on the couch as though she weren’t forty-five, and assuming her normal position.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned and moved to join her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “...and that’s all. Nothing happened. Friendly touches, tears, pizza, a drinking game, and we passed out.” She summarized after droning on for the past hour.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s it? You acted like you were twenty-two, were moderately drunk, and you didn’t even make out? You make out with everyone when you’re drunk, we’ve done it a time or two.” Wanda admonished.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not everyone, only women, and we haven’t done that in a while, I remember being threatened. I also don’t drink to get drunk and have things under control.” She pointed out. “Besides, Rio and I are friends. ONLY FRIENDS.” Agatha gave Wanda a pointed look.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever.” Wanda pouted. “I happen to think with the similar backgrounds, similar interests, etc., it would go well.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head, holding her hands out in front of her. “Whatever you say, but it’s not happening.”
    </p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
     After leaving Jen’s house, Alice went straight to Rio’s apartment instead of her own. Alice walked in, using her key, and handed Rio a container of vegetable fried rice. “It tastes almost like Gran’s.” She sat the rest of the containers on the coffee table and sat on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     “The fried rice I make tastes just like Gran’s, because she taught me how to make it.” Rio looked at Alice suspiciously. Chinese take-out meant one thing.
    </p>
<p>
     “We don’t have time. I’m panicking in a lesbian way.” Alice whined.
    </p>
<p>
     “There it is, water? Soda? Tea?” Rio listed off beverages and headed toward the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Water, I need to hydrate.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I bet you do!” Rio chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice pouted, “Unfortunately, not like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio came back and handed Alice her water before settling into the couch with her fried rice, Alice already cradling wonton soup close to her chest. “We went back to Jen’s place and had a movie night.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What movies?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Bound and I Can’t Think Straight. Movies we have both seen. Multiple times. With each other.” Alice lamented.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit, Alice, what happened?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Straight up gay panic of the middle age variety. We cuddled, Ri. We fell asleep like that, and then I snuck out and didn’t even say goodbye. We have been decently close friends since I moved out here. Ten years, Rio. Ten.” Alice took a bite of a dumpling, shaking her head at her own idiocy.
    </p>
<p>
     “So let me get this sapphic, the two of you have been circling each other for years now, dropping hints like carabiners at Lilith Fair, and still nothing?” Rio asked, disbelief written all over her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Our inaction is physically painful at this point,” Alice winced.
    </p>
<p>
     “What the hell are you waiting for? Her to invite you to a Melissa Etheridge concert?” Rio had finished eating and was gesturing with hands.
    </p>
<p>
     “Muna or Xana might be more her speed, but no. It’s just, that she’s so serious and aggressive with everything and I’m way more laid back. Plus she’s always busy.” Alice explained.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed heavily. “You’re a teacher, there are months where no one even sees us. Her clients are your family, and she spends time with them too, right? You would balance each other out well.”
    </p>
<p>
     “If this were a book or a movie, I would yell at the characters right now.” Alice groaned. “Enough about me. You and Agatha, stepping into friendship, that’s awesome.” She gave her a double thumbs up and a sarcastic wink.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh go to hell, Wu,” Rio replied. Rio had filled Alice in on everything that had happened the previous night and Rio was very glad she had made the decision to join SHIELD and that Alice could talk to her more freely now. There was so much Rio hadn’t known about Alice the past ten years.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “It’s the last week before school starts. Open House and Meet-the-Teacher is on Tuesday, and we have planning and all of the things that come with it for the rest of the week. Anything next weekend?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice shook her head. “Nothing that I can think of. Sports haven’t started yet, and I can’t think of any parties or anything.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Great.” Rio wanted time to prepare to be in this new world of celebrity parents, celebrity children, dealing with public relations reps, possible paparazzi, and the other things that might pop up. It was going to be a wild ride and she needed to be prepared.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Tuesday arrived and Rio was dressed in the required jeans and SHIELD t-shirt for the night. The faculty were lined up on stage behind Lilia Calderu as she addressed the parents, guardians, and adults responsible for the various students of SHIELD before setting everyone free for the event. Calderu would dismiss the teachers to their classrooms first. She would then address the families separately before allowing them to roam the campus grounds.
    </p>
<p>
     “As a reminder, everyone has signed a set of iron-clad NDAs that covers everything that could possibly come up. These NDAs apply for students, all reps, agents, etc. We take privacy very seriously here at SHIELD and it’s one of the reasons we are the elite educational institution for the best and brightest in Hollywood and the upper class. While our teachers get to their classrooms…” That was their cue and the faculty turned and exited the stage.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had spotted Agatha and Wanda as they entered earlier, and a few other now familiar faces. She waved to Alice as they split to go to their separate rooms. Rio left her door open, double checked that the slideshow was scrolling automatically and that the handouts were neatly organized. She took a deep breath and took her position at the front of the room to meet parents and students, just like she had every year at her previous school. With six different periods, she would be meeting a lot of students and parents over the next hour and a half.
    </p>
<p>
     The secretary’s voice came over the loudspeaker to announce that parents and students were being released to make their way around their respective buildings.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here we go” Rio whispered to herself as the first few parents started to filter in.
    </p>
<p>
     She shook hands, handed out information, made small talk, told students what they would need, and smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     Her smile widened when Wanda, Agatha, boys, and a man she assumed was Vision walked in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio Vidal, this is my husband, Dr. Vision Maximoff. He’s a professor at UCLA.” Wanda smiled brightly, though it did not reach her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s so nice to meet you Dr. Maximoff, I’ve heard a lot about you.” Rio lied. Wanda’s smile melted into one of sincere appreciation that Vision didn’t see.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, call me Vision. I’ve heard a lot about you from all the ladies in my life, and have a feeling you’ll soon be a fixture at the compound,” Vision replied with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     The boys just groaned and Rio gave a polite chuckle. It seemed as though Wanda made sure to keep the little coven around at all times.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky and Tommy, it’s nice to see you both again. You must be Billy.” Rio shook each of their hands.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, hi Ms. Vidal.” He replied shyly. He was the kid who took after Vision. They spoke for a second before Vision and the boys moved to the next class. Wanda put her arm on Rio’s bicep and spoke softly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, we’re meeting up with Jen, Nat, and Alice after this for a late dinner, you’re coming.”
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t a request.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced at Agatha who was talking to Pepper Potts-Stark, who had a hand on Agatha’s arm. What was that story? Rio wondered.
    </p>
<p>
     “I rode with Alice and it sounds like I don’t have a choice.” She blew air out of her nose in amusement.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda’s smile widened. “Glad we’re on the same page, see you later!” She turned and grabbed Agatha’s arm as she said goodbye to Pepper, and they moved to the next classroom.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at the clock, noticing there was still another half hour to go.
    </p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the night was uneventful as Rio collected her belongings and walked out the door, hearing it click shut behind her as Alice walked toward her from down the hall.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, Wanda told me about dinner,” Rio said as her friend came up beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‘Oh, yeah, it’s tradition. I was going to tell you when we were done.” Alice chewed nervously on her pinky nail. “We don’t have to go if you don’t want to though. It’s late and we have work. Plus Raven needs to be fed,” Alice blurted out quickly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned her head and looked at Alice suspiciously as they walked out of the building.
    </p>
<p>
     “You let me take your car before anyone arrived so I could go feed her highness early, and it’s only 8:00. We’ll get home later than normal, but we have a late report time in the morning. Since when do you not…” Rio stopped as realization hit.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ohhhh! You haven’t talked to one Ms. Kale since you ghosted her Sunday morning! How many texts has she sent you? Calls? Voicemails? No. She’s not that type.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice was at the car, glaring back at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio jogged the rest of the way and got in the vehicle. “Oh, Wanda is going to make the two of you sit next to each other!” She cackled as they got in the car.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, we know where you’re sitting!” Alice shot back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I would sit in Agatha’s lap if it meant having a front-row seat to whatever this is about to be.” She replied, laughing harder.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When they arrived, just as expected, the only two seats that were left were one next to Jen and one next to Agatha, with Wanda directing each of them as to where to sit. It was an old-style diner, a burgers, and milkshakes type of place. Everyone placed their orders before delving into the conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a round table so that everyone could see and speak to each other. Rio and Alice sat next to each other and could have switched places, but Wanda’s look said that they would not be doing that.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda sat on the other side of Agatha, with Nat next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice immediately dug her nails into Rio’s thigh and turned to talk to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen ignored Alice and spoke with Nat.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Alice,” Rio whispered. “She is not happy with the way you left things. Talk to her, now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen looked across the table at Agatha, “I know you have a lot of press to run, a few projects in post, but I have a few — “
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put up a hand to stop her. “No shop talk right now, and I’m with Rio.” She pointed at Alice. “Talk.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice had turned to Nat and Wanda who had done the same thing and told her to talk to Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     The two women turned to each other with four sets of eyes on them. When Jen turned to look at everyone else, the other four started talking to each other. Jen turned back to Alice.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice took a deep breath, she had no idea what she was going to do or say. “I’m really sorry for how I left Sunday morning. I don’t know what got into me.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      I’m tired of running and I wanted to kiss you because I want more and I’m tired of pretending I’m okay with just being friends.
     </em>
     She left that unspoken, not for here.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen almost always knew what she wanted out of her life. It’s not that she didn’t know what she wanted, it’s that she knew Alice was one of her closest friends. She cherished the times they had together. She was already worried she would lose Alice now that Rio was in town, she couldn’t risk dating her and them breaking up.
    </p>
<p>
     The fact remained that Jen wanted nothing more than to actually be with Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     She took a sip of her drink, her throat suddenly dry.
    </p>
<p>
     “I understand. And, about that, it was nice, but you know I’m not looking for anything serious right now.” Jen’s heart ached as she spoke the words, her eyes searching Alice’s to see how she took it. Maybe, just maybe, Alice would read Jen’s mind.
     <em>
      You, I want you.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice looked down, not wanting Jen to see into her shattered soul. “Oh, right, I know, and you know I’m not either. How often have we had those talks with each other, right?” Alice tried to give a small laugh, but it fell flat.
     <em>
      This bitch.
     </em>
     “Just friends and occasional movie cuddle buddies?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Something had flashed across Alice’s face, but it happened so quickly that Jennifer couldn’t quite tell what it was as she was clouded by her own hurt. “Of course, always.” She smiled and turned back to the group. “Yes, can we help you bunch of Nosey Nellie’s?” Jen asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put a comforting hand on Alice’s leg.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, just a natural lull in conversation is all,” Agatha mused.
    </p>
<p>
     “For the duration of ours?” Jen asked dryly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Coincidence.” Agatha looked across at Nat and asked a random question, getting everyone to start talking again.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda wanted to scream. Why would these idiots not let her push them together? Jen and Alice were the perfect balance for each other, and they may not see it, but Wanda knew there was love there.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio were basically soulmates.
    </p>
<p>
     Idiots.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda Maximoff was surrounded by relationship-impaired idiots, why wouldn’t they listen to her when she obviously had all the answers?
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Nat bit back a laugh. She could tell Wanda was about to implode and it was adorable. She shook her head slightly, trying to shake the thought out of her head. Nat knew Wanda wanted everyone else to be happy in love, to live their happy ending, when Wanda herself was very much not.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat quickly squeezed Wanda’s thigh and watched the other redhead visibly relax.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Alice and Jen.
     <em>
      Maybe they should focus on themselves instead of meddling with others.
     </em>
     She glanced at Agatha. She couldn’t believe she was friends with this group of women, let alone Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at each woman one by one. Maybe if they would stop meddling and focus on themselves, they would figure out what they wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     Their food came and they chatted over current events and other celebrities while they ate. She and Rio had a private conversation about a television series that only they watched, agreeing that the background sapphic romance needed to take more screen time. Season three was set to premiere the following spring and they made plans to watch it together.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was planning to watch a show with someone months in advance.
     <em>
      Like a friend
     </em>
     . She told herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda kept looking at her throughout their meal, the two stars had a way of speaking by just looking at each other.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda darted her eyes at Rio.
     <em>
      Take the leap, ask her out.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes.
     <em>
      Take your own advice.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda glared.
     <em>
      It’s complicated and you know that.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed.
     <em>
      We’re a mess, angel.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda shrugged and nodded.
     <em>
      At least we’ll always have each other Aggie.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded and winked.
     <em>
      I love you.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda smiled and looked down.
     <em>
      I love you too.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Once in the car, Rio smacked Alice’s arm.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re an idiot! Gran would smack you so hard your ancestors would have felt it!” Rio exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ow! Good thing I hadn’t started driving yet!” Alice exclaimed as she started to drive.
    </p>
<p>
     “You like that beautiful woman and you two decided to just be friends. What is this? High school!? If it doesn’t work out, then it doesn’t work out and you act like adults. When we get home, you will be calling her and asking her out on a date. Do I need to be there to witness it? Because I will. Ten years, you useless lesbians.” She sighed and sunk back into her seat after her rant.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice stared out of the windshield, a sly smile on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice was overjoyed to have her sister back in her life.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen was grateful to be in her car.  She made a quick escape, waving goodbye to her friends with a tight-lipped smile and practically running to the car before Wanda could get on to her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Once in the car and on the road, she turned on the music and did something that Jennifer Kale did not do.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She cried.
    </p>

     Speaking of Wanda. I am not

<p>
     I mean, she’s so desperate for

    </p>
<p>
     She spends way more time

     That is her story to tell.

     Not mine.

<p>
     But you can’t just ask her either.

     She has to tell you in her time.

     You have to be patient.

     Anyway, on Labor Day weekend, we usually
    </p>
<p>
     hang out at the beach house. I’m assuming
    </p>
<p>
     Alice hasn’t told you yet. It’s the group, the
    </p>
<p>
     boys, and Vision. Though the menfolk
    </p>
<p>
     generally go fishing during the day. Want
    </p>
<p>
     to join us?
    </p>
<p>

     Rio put her phone aside and smiled. She would tell Alice all about it in the morning. A weekend at Agatha’s beach house sounded like a lot of fun, even with three students. With this new group of friends, she had a feeling everything was going to be a lot different from now on.

<p>
<span>
      Jennifer Kale had cried for exactly two minutes. It had quite possibly been the most she had cried in ten years over something personal. She walked into her townhouse, locked her door, and began to go through her nighttime routine. She had a meticulous skincare regimen she followed. Alice constantly told her that she didn’t need it and that Jen’s skin was naturally perfect, but she wasn’t taking any chances.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Alice.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen huffed and stamped her foot in the empty bedroom, now wearing silk pajamas.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      How dare Alice sneak out of here like a coward Sunday morning and then tell her they should just be friends? They had cuddled on that very couch multiple times and fallen asleep. Didn’t ALL sapphics with crushes on each other do that? Wasn’t that some unwritten law somewhere?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Didn’t Alice know she was supposed to stop Jen and say, “No. We will not be doing the just friends thing. We should be together.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen should have known that Alice wasn’t going to do that. Alice was a protector, she defended. She didn’t charge in blindly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Neither of them did. It’s why they had been in this predicament forever.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had hoped that Rio's moving here would spur Alice to make a move. Alice talked about Rio constantly, about how Rio always gave her the courage to do things.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So much for that plan.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen rinsed and washed her face before rubbing in moisturizer when her phone rang. It was the distinct ringtone she had given to Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She patted her face dry while reaching for the device.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A video call.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fine, Alice, I’ll play.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She answered and immediately smiled upon seeing Alice wearing Jen’s University of Oregon shirt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Go on a date with me.” Alice blurted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen couldn’t hide her shock as her mouth hung open. “W-what did you just say to me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I like you, Jen, and I have for years. I know we don’t want to risk our friendship, but I can’t pretend anymore, okay? Go out with me. Saturday. There’s —”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes. Saturday.” Jen cut her off with a wide smile, her eyes sparkling. She didn’t care where they went. She just knew it was about time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of the week flew by as Rio and Alice prepared for the first day of school on the upcoming Monday. Alice had asked Jen out, and they were scheduled to go out the upcoming Saturday. On a real date. Their friends were possibly more excited than they were. The Friday before, Agatha and Wanda met with Jen about offers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen walked into Agatha’s house, where they often met. Her office was more for her to have phone calls and handle meetings with heads of studios and the like. When she dealt with her ‘talent’, which was only Agatha and Wanda, she did so at their houses, usually Agatha’s, and killed two birds with one stone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned on her laptop and laid her folders down.“First, I would like to thank you both for recently making the PR side of my job easy. Agatha, you’ve been lying relatively low. A certain brunette keeping you from hoeing about?” She jabbed, “Wanda, you always do great.” She smiled at both of them, sincerely at Wanda, who smiled back from her normal spot as Agatha flipped her off from hers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jennifer rolled her eyes. “Real mature, Harkness. Anyway, you both have the press for your upcoming releases, various things in post, multiple commercial campaigns running, and awards season coming up. Also, Wanda, you, and Nat are leaving this afternoon for some things in New York this weekend. And... I have offers for you both.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Marvel is offering you roles, but as you know, Marvel comes with massive secrecy. You won’t even know what those roles are until after you talk with them and accept them. Disney, knowing how well you work together, also has opposite roles for both of you. Then there’s a TV show, Agatha, a comedy, something you’d be great at. Wanda, a movie for Netflix, definitely would be an award-winner. What do you think?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They looked at each other and back at Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes.” They said in unison.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Neither of you even knows the location, dates, anything.” She responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her. “You didn’t provide any of that information, meaning you don’t have it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen sighed. “Caught me. We know Marvel doesn’t have it yet. Disney will work around Marvel, and we have to know those two to know about the third roles for each of you. We’re looking at the next few years being taken up by Marvel and Disney, with some smaller projects in between. I will get back to everyone, and we’ll start the processes.” She shot off the emails she had already drafted, put everything back in her bag, and looked at them. “Now, on to more important things. I have a date with Alice tomorrow, and I don’t know what to wear, and, oddly,  I’m nervous.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was idly scrolling through her phone. “Just go back to her place, strip, and get it all out of both of your systems. You’ve been circling each other like horny lesbian sharks for years.” She responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s jaw dropped. “AGATHA!” She gasped. “These are our friends, and we want them to be happy!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up. “Getting laid makes me happy.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda smacked her on the leg and looked at Jen, who had an exasperated look on her face. “Ignoring this one, wear something comfortable. Where are you going?” She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank you, Wanda,” Jen said, shooting Agatha an exasperated look. “And thank you for absolutely nothing, Agatha.” Agatha shrugged. She was not the person to go to for dating advice. Sex advice, absolutely. Dating, absolutely not. Jen continued, “Lunch and a multi-cultural festival I wanted to go to that I mentioned a month or so back.” She responded with a slight smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda squealed, “She listened and remembered! Okay, so comfortable shoes for walking, obviously, and then something comfortable for being outside in the heat. A sundress! Go with a sundress. Pink is your color, do that!” She was giddy and in her element. As much as she didn’t want her sons to grow up, she couldn’t wait to help them out with dates either.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned. “Don’t forget a hat so you don’t blind her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did you even brush your hair today? The iconic hair that you’re supposed to take meticulous care of?” Jen responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did you polish your head?” Agatha shot back. “And I do take care of my hair when necessary, thank you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Will you two stop it? Agatha, you're just jealous because there are so many rules and stipulations with your hair and how iconic it is. The times you have been able to do anything with it, even that was meticulously curated and written into contracts and insurance policies.” Wanda turned to Jen, “She was in her late twenties and had to shave it for a role when she found out how terrible she looked bald. It took months just to greenlight the haircut and the movie. They almost had to get a body double just because it was taking so long.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am not jealous,” Agatha mumbled. Much like other celebrities had iconic features, hers had been her hair since she was a kid, to the point where, like Taylor Swift’s legs, Mariah Carey’s vocal cords, and America Ferrera’s smile were insured, so had been her hair. It hadn’t been her idea, and it still wasn’t her favorite thing in the world. However, it made sense business-wise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re also jealous because I have a date, and you don’t,” Jen added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, please. I could have any date I wanted.” She huffed, hating that they were teaming up against her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Stop it. Both of you.” Wanda warned, using her mom voice and glare. The other two women muttered as they changed the topic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       was
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      slightly annoyed that Alice and Jennifer had figured it out right after deciding to remain friends. What was worse was that she knew Rio had been the one to make the final push. She had reminded herself that she and Rio had just met. Agatha Harkness possessed many things. However, patience was not one of them. She didn’t want to screw things up, and Rio was extremely young. Agatha was not entirely sure where this was coming from, and knew that remaining friends was the best course of action. Clearly, she was letting Wanda and her other friends get to her, and she needed to focus on her career. She needed to devote her time to preparing for her commitments and promoting her upcoming projects.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew she was bored and that was all.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “...football starts up in September, so we have that, and then the premiere for
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Death’s Beloved
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      in October.” Wanda looked over at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen perked up. “This one has been promoted for months. There’s already award talk, as you both know. The theme song has been everywhere already.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda turned to Agatha with a wide grin, and Agatha could already see the wheels turning in her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You should take Rio,” Wanda said excitedly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head. “No, I know this is not one for Nicky to attend, but I thought we’d go together since we played opposite each other.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen held up a hand, eyes lighting up. “No, Wanda’s on to something. Wanda, people have been wondering about you and Vision.” She gave her a pointed look as Wanda looked away. “So you should probably walk the carpet with your husband. Unless you planned on walking it with someone else, that’s not Agatha?” Wanda shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Right. So, go with your husband, and Agatha, take Rio. We’re not doing fake dating or any publicity stunts like that, so no one goes down that road, but it will be nice for people to see that you have other friends. I’ve been trying to get Alice to walk the carpet for years as the daughter of Lorna Wu, but she won’t touch it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha glared at both of them. “I’ll think about it, and we’ll circle back. How’s that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. “I’ll take it. Now, Jen, about your date tomorrow.” She wanted to change the subject as quickly as possible before this could turn back to her at all, just glad Nat wasn’t here.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice was nervous. It was Saturday, and she was finally going on a date with Jen. The events from the previous Tuesday continued to play in Alice’s head. She and Jen agreeing to be just friends, and Rio pushing Alice to call Jen an hour later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice had been so afraid Jen would say no, but instead, she said yes before Alice even finished speaking. Apparently, Jen’s “I’m not looking for anything serious” was more of a defense mechanism than anything. So here Alice was, in her closet, with Rio sitting on her bed, telling her what to wear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Seriously, Alice, she’s going to think you’re beautiful no matter what you wear. She’s absolutely into you.” She said, popping a chip into her mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You didn’t even know we liked each other,” Alice replied, holding a black shirt up to herself before making a face and replacing it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, true, but I just met everyone, and anytime I see the two of you together, Agatha is there. You try paying attention to anyone else when Agatha Harkness is standing RIGHT THERE.” She gestured with her hand to make the point.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice pulled on a pair of black shorts, moving so that Rio could see how they looked. “I do it all the time. Almost a decade, Ri.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded her approval of the shorts as the other woman disappeared back into the closet. “I applaud your strength. Yes, the orange halter. It honestly is your color. She was also apparently very close with your mother, found that out last weekend, and I’m new to the friend group. The Converse, the plain black ones. I’m surprised you didn’t see her more when you were younger. ” She added. The more Rio was learning, the more hurt she was becoming. How much longer could she tell herself that Alice was just doing what was best? “Wear your hair down, it’s so pretty like that. I’m so glad you didn’t do it all red.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice had never made dating a major priority in her life, and Rio wanted the best for her. The more Alice shared about Jen, the more it seemed like Jen would be a good fit for her. It helped that they had known each other for so long, and they already knew each other’s quirks and habits. Alice had been cautious of LA, anything to do with Hollywood, dating, and even drinking for a very long time. Rio had been the bad influence of the two. Anything that could take her down the path of Lorna Wu, she kept at arm’s length. Alice knew she had the same addictive personality as her mother did. She had to take things slowly and in moderation, integrating into the world of Hollywood, and wine nights, she was still careful with any type of medication, and with that, came dating.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m happy for you, Alice. It’s going to go great. If you need any help with dating advice, well, there’s maybe Wanda? She seems to have good luck in that department, just not in the decision-making aspect of it. If you want to find yourself in a horrible situation though, I’m your girl.” Rio gave her the thumbs up as Alice came out and closed the door, showing off the completed look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That was not your fault. You had no idea ANY of that was going to happen. Now, wish me luck, and text Agatha to see what she’s doing tonight.” Alice winked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed and hugged her tightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s going to work out. She’s already wrapped around you like that finger trap that got stuck on your finger when we were fifteen and drunk.” Rio whispered before she let Alice go and left to go back to her own apartment.
     </span>
</p>

      “It was Lunar New Year, we had too much sake, and it was made for toddlers!” Alice said after her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then drink some sake!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stared at her phone as she thought about texting Agatha. “Friends hang out with each other. If Alice wasn’t going out with Jen, we would do something tonight.” She said, looking over at the cat, who had jumped up on the couch with her.
     </span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She hesitated before sending it and looked over at Raven. “Alice won’t come back and want to go over everything, right? Surely they’ll hang out all night, right?” Raven gave a soft meow before climbing into her lap. “Right.” She pressed send and automatically saw that Agatha was typing a response.

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked down at the phone. She hadn’t changed Agatha’s contact from what Alice and crew had entered, so the purple heart had stayed. She wondered what they had put in Agatha’s phone. She thought for a moment and looked down at Raven. “You might meet a new friend today, old woman. Hopefully, you like her.”

      Rio placed her phone on the coffee table and stood up to make sure her apartment was tidied up. Rio kept it clean but didn’t want any dishes in the sink or accidental underwear on the floor. She scooped out the cat box, took out the trash, double-checked that the bathroom was clean, and all the usual ‘someone other than my sister is coming over’ chores were done. She looked in the fridge to see what she had on hand and decided on a chicken and bacon pasta from scratch. It was simple but with a homemade sauce, so somewhat impressive. She was wearing normal lazy Saturday clothes: black sweats and a green tank, with hair clipped up, and barefoot. She wasn’t going to bother changing as she saw no need. It wasn’t like she was trying to impress Agatha. She wasn’t. She fed Raven in hopes that she’d leave them alone while they ate, knowing full well that she wouldn’t. She already had music playing as she couldn’t stand silence and always had something playing. Currently, it was some random Spotify mix. She looked at her phone as it dinged, seeing a text from Alice.

      Rio grinned, she was genuinely happy for her friend and so glad she pushed her to do this. Meddling was good sometimes only when she did it, though.

<p>
<span>
      Agatha had packed a bag, not because she thought anything would happen, but because she wanted to be comfortable at Rio’s house. She was used to having to look a certain way when she was out during the day, which was why she wore jeans and a simple black top. Nice enough to be photographed if she were seen between the vehicle and Rio’s building. She had packed sweats and a UCLA shirt to change into later. She was glad Rio had texted her, although honestly, Agatha had been about ten minutes away from texting her new friend herself. It was the weekend before school started, and she wanted to spend time together before she was buried in work this week.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had sent her the address, though she already knew where she lived, having been to Alice’s plenty of times over the years. Her thoughts wandered to her friends in New York, wanting to check on them, but knowing it was best to leave them alone when they were on their own. Agatha sighed at the thought of Wanda and that whole…thing. She knew Wanda would always do what Wanda felt was best for the boys, and that she and Vision loved each other in their way. It was a messy situation, and she needed Wanda to hurry the hell up and fill Rio in so she had someone to talk to about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook the thoughts away as the elevator doors opened on Rio’s floor and walked to the door. She had been let into the building easily. The doormen were all the same and knew her, even if they hadn’t, no one told Agatha Harkness no. She was one of the most recognizable people in the world. She knocked and wasn’t surprised when the door opened almost immediately.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey,” Rio said, standing aside to let her in. “Make yourself at home, put your bag wherever. What do you want to drink?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hi,” She replied, not setting her bag down yet. Eyes landing on what looked like something fruity. “Whatever you’re drinking is fine, and where’s your bathroom? I want to change. I hate having to look put together all the time.” She grimaced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed. “I have a rum and pineapple, and there’s one down the hall on the right. I completely get it. I’m not ready to wear teacher clothes every day. I’ll grab our food. We’re even eating at the table. Like adults!” She responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh goody!” She said sarcastically as she headed down the hall.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When she returned a few minutes later, she set her bag behind the couch and joined Rio at the table. “You cook?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Alice and I both do. Gran made sure of it. I had taught myself growing up anyway, but Gran honed my skill.” She answered as they both started eating.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hummed in satisfaction, “You did a great job. I do okay, but this is amazing. If that whole teaching thing doesn’t pan out, you’ve got a backup skill to fall back on.” Agatha downplayed her own skills. She had been taught to cook by two women who believed that she should know how to cook for herself. One of those people had learned from the same person Rio had.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s cheeks tinged a light pink. “You’re not the first one to say that.” Her eyes darted to Agatha’s feet. “I apologize if Raven tries to steal your food.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha raised an eyebrow, “The cat? I haven’t even…” She was cut off by a feline intruder jumping into her lap. “...and you must be Raven. Sorry, but I am not sharing with you.” She said as she put her fork down and removed the cat from her lap, only for Raven to jump into the other empty lap and be dismissed for a second time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. “I promise I feed her, do not listen to her lies.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve never seen a cat beg for human food before,” Agatha remarked, watching as the cat sat between the two chairs, green eyes watching them both.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, that’s not a cat, as I said before, that is an immortal familiar.” Rio finished her food, putting her fork down, watching Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her and down at her plate. “Do you even taste your food? We’ve been sitting for five minutes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That was me tasting my food and eating slowly.” She replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head and gestured ahead with her fork. “Well, do continue about Raven.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Alice and I adopted her when we got our first place in college. Alice is more of a dog person, but she humored me. We were at the shelter, about to adopt another cat, when a kitten was meowing incessantly. Suddenly, this mostly black paw shot out of the adjacent kennel, attempting to smack the kitten to get it to stop, and all we saw were these shiny green eyes. I swear to this day that cat was not there. The shelter didn’t even have the paperwork for her and made up some random name, and I’m pretty sure falsified information when we decided that we obviously had to have the magical mystery cat. That was nearly sixteen years ago. They guessed she was around two, though not a single vet has been able to age her properly. On paper, she’s eighteen, but in reality? No idea. In my heart? At least a thousand.” Rio smiled affectionately at the aged feline, now more brown and orange than black as she once had been. She turned her attention back to Agatha, passion in her voice as she continued speaking about her cat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shortly after Norma died, when Alice moved out here and I moved to a different place of my own for the first time, Raven disappeared for six weeks. I thought she was gone, that I had lost her, too.” Rio’s smile faltered, something dark sliding over her eyes before it left just as quickly as it had appeared. “Thankfully, she returned without a scratch, no parasites, nothing. A little thin and in need of a bath, which she hated. The vet was mystified. I’ve also seen her chase off predators, hunt things much bigger than her, all kinds of unusual things. She’s basically a friend-shaped Eldritch creature.” Raven now perched in Rio’s lap, eyeing Agatha, as Rio absentmindedly scratched her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at the animal, having finished her dinner, and now leaned forward with her chin propped on her fist. “You are one interesting cat.” She noted, as the cat in question judged her. She turned back to Rio. “Why do I feel like she’s staring into my soul?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because she is. Seconds?” Rio stood and took their plates.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, thank you. That was great. Let me help.” Agatha stood, collected their empty glasses, and followed Rio into the kitchen. As she helped clean up, she noticed how intently Raven watched her. Agatha had never felt judged by a cat before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I feel like she’s sizing me up.” Agatha finally said as they finished cleaning up, putting leftovers away, and refreshing their drinks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She does that.” Was all Rio said as she walked back to the living room, and they both sat on the couch. “Have you told anyone that I’m going to the beach house yet?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, have you?” Agatha turned toward Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No. No particular reason. I just haven’t shared it with Alice yet. She’s been so excited about this date, and I keep forgetting.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, Jen has been, too, and Wanda, of course.” Agatha shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Movie?” Rio asked, changing the subject before asking questions she knew Agatha would not give her the answers to. She tried to think of a movie that wasn’t an Agatha or Wanda film, she was in the mood to watch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes. Want to watch one we’ve probably both seen a million times and make commentary?” Agatha asked with a sly grin. “It’s one of my favorite things to do.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If we can find one, I’m not sure I’ve seen that many black and white movies.” Rio joked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hit her with a pillow, smirking at the ‘Live Laugh Lesbian’ saying. “We can watch another Disney or PG one, child.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked to the ceiling and poked her tongue into the side of her cheek. “Okay, point taken. What about the lesbian classic D.E.B.S?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The extremely cheesy spy thriller with a killer 80s soundtrack?” Agatha asked with a knowing smirk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The one and only,” Rio answered, already searching through her various subscription services for the movie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, absolutely, but only if we turn it into a sing-along.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They shared sarcastic comments and sang along with exaggerated movements, noting the various tropes of the movie. Agatha pointed out different people she knew, including those she
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       knew.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How do you even keep track, or remember?” Rio shook her head, laughing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A gentle sapphic never forgets, lest she repeats.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio scoffed. “How many little black books do you have?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A small library full,” Agatha winked at Rio scandalously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes and shook her head again, saying nothing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s face softened as the credits began to roll. “Does it bother you?” Her voice was softer now, quieter. Agatha was not ashamed of her decades of conquests and dalliances. It was part of who she was, and it was widely known. Yet she found herself somewhat self-conscious of it for the first time since she was thirteen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tilted her head to the side and thought about it. This was Agatha Harkness. Quite possibly the most respectful ‘playboy’ to roam the Earth. She knew women who had
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       encountered
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      her. You couldn’t live in the state of California and not know at least one. Agatha was legendary in terms of respect, boundaries, and aftercare. She wasn’t going to call you back, and lightning never struck twice, but for someone with her reputation, it was a respectful one.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No. It would if you were arrogant in the way men are, or if there were rumors of you treating women horribly, but no. Besides, everyone has hobbies.” Rio gestured around her apartment at her plants.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For some reason, Rio Vidal’s approval was the validation that Agatha needed at that moment. Not that it mattered, it’s not like they would ever be doing anything. Rio was a friend, not food.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had only really sought the validation of five people in her life, not counting the public as a whole. Two of those people were dead, one was no longer in her life, one was a middle-aged redhead, and the other was a teenage boy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      None of them were Rio Vidal, yet here she was, overcome with warmth from knowing that the beautiful,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       friend
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , woman next to her, did not see her as less than, or a horrible person for her choice of extracurricular activities.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The next movie started automatically while they talked and laughed late into the night. Rio looked over at Agatha when the older woman’s voice cut off mid-sentence to see that she had fallen asleep. Rio looked at her for a moment, taking in Agatha’s sleeping form, now in sweats and an oversized UCLA t-shirt. It was a deep-set couch, one that Rio had spent many nights on when her bed felt too big and empty. She glanced toward her room and back to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had a decision to make. She groaned as she stood and stretched. She glanced down at Agatha and again in the direction of her room as she tidied the living room and turned off any remaining lights.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio went to her bathroom and brushed her teeth, trying not to think about Agatha sound asleep on her couch. The couch that could, in theory, safely fit both of them. Innocently, as friends. She walked back through her room and picked up a blanket to drape over her sleeping friend as she cast a cynical look at her bed. “Oh, what, like you have any room to judge. You’re not comforting.” She scoffed at the offending piece of furniture as she went back to the couch, having decided on her fate.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio curled up in a ball opposite Agatha and draped the blanket over them. They weren’t cuddling, they weren’t even touching—just two friends who had fallen asleep on the same piece of furniture together. Rio had a feeling this was a normal occurrence in this co-dependent coven. She settled in, whispered goodnight, and went to sleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Raven hopped up on the couch and weighed her options before climbing on top of Agatha and falling asleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For the second Sunday morning in a row, the early morning sunlight filtered in and gently cast its light across Rio and Agatha, this time asleep on the same couch, legs intertwined.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice burst through the door barefoot, hair askew,  wearing nothing but an orange sports bra and Garfield boxers. She pounced on Rio and planted a giant kiss on her cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love you and am forever indebted to you. Good morning, Aggie.” Alice grinned, quickly disappearing. “Enjoy your morning!” She called as the door shut behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was still half asleep, but mumbled. “Was that her thanking you because they fucked?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sleepily shook her head. “No. Knowing my sister, they decided to date, finally kissed, Jen spent the night, and they woke up holding each other. Lesbians. It was her thank you for that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ah,” Agatha clicked her tongue, eyes still closed. “She’s going to text their group chat about this, isn’t she?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yep,” Rio popped the p, shifting under the covers. “Wanda will be insufferable this week.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed. “I’m going back to sleep.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn’t until after Agatha had left and Alice had come over to tell Rio about her date that Rio finally let herself process last night’s sleeping situation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Our legs were all wrapped together, Alice!” Rio exclaimed, making some complicated motions using both arms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, we’ve slept like that, no big deal,” Alice shrugged as she put the final touches on a seating chart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, but you’re my sister, and while gorgeous, you’re not Mother Harkness,” Rio referred to Agatha by her Instagram handle and what she was commonly referred to by the lesbian community.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice didn’t take offense as she knew exactly what Rio meant. “Knew you still had that crush, Ms. ‘We’re just friends’. Besides, you’re the one who made the very conscious decision to sleep on the couch.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We are just friends, which might complicate things. I knew I shouldn’t have told you I chose to sleep on the couch.” She grimaced. “No, she’s the parent of a student.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, you’re both tactile and you like to cuddle. It’s cute, even if you don’t end up together. You have another platonic cuddle buddy.” Alice tried to spin it in a positive light.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just sighed. “Meanwhile, you’ve found yourself a whole-ass wife,” she grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No one said anything about any of that.” Alice glared back. “We are taking things slow, still painfully so. We are officially dating though, and it’s about fucking time.” Their whole relationship had been based on caution, why not remain at that speed? Alice sighed. At this rate, Agatha and Rio would be grandparents, and Wanda would figure out her life by the time she and Jen even moved in together.

      Agatha had been waiting for Wanda to return from her trip. Agatha had told Wanda that she was to come to Agatha’s immediately.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had just finished her fourth set of Pilates when the non-lethal redhead finally came in the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I had Nat take my stuff to the house. What’s wrong? You wouldn’t tell me, is everything okay?” Wanda asked, eyes searching the older woman’s face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We fell asleep on the couch, our legs were all,” she gestured with her arms to mimic their legs, “when we woke up, and it just felt natural. I don’t cuddle with just anyone.” Agatha plopped on the couch, running out of energy, as the words flowed forth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda tried to control her excitement and not overreact. Agatha was right. She didn’t spend the night with people. She was tactile with very few, the core group being it, and even then, mainly Wanda. “How did Rio react?” She asked cautiously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shrugged. “We both acted like nothing happened.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda mimicked Agatha’s plop and looked over at her. “A bunch of useless lesbians, I swear.” She sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The worst.” Agatha agreed. “She’s fun, attractive, smart, I can tell her anything.” She shook her head. “But, no. I will not be dating my son’s teachers...anymore.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What a great time to up your standards,” Wanda remarked. “You didn’t
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       date
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      them in the first place, nor do you date. You won’t even mention how you’re feeling about the intimacy of it all.” She studied Agatha’s face for any signs of how she felt, and while she saw a few twitches, Agatha’s multitudes of awards weren’t for nothing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Where Wanda had to put forth the effort to keep her emotions from being written all over her face, Agatha had been born with a resting bitch face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I will not be doing that at this moment. We are friends and nothing more.” Agatha replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shook her head. After nearly three decades with Agatha, this didn’t surprise her. “Do you need a shovel to bury those feelings?” She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha scoffed. “Can I borrow yours?” She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I hate you.” Wanda smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

      “You love me,” Agatha responded.

      The first day of school started with a school-wide meeting before students arrived. Lilia looked at the faculty and staff and reminded everyone, once again, of the NDAs that had been signed, their unusual student body and parents, the school’s mission, and so forth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was beginning to detest the term.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “In conclusion,” Lilia had said, “we are not just working with parents, but nannies, managers, agents, PR, etc. You will develop all types of
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       relationships.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      We are all adults here, and we sign NDAs for a reason. I have eyes and ears everywhere. I know what goes on. Act like adults and keep things out of the public eye, or at least let the reps handle it how they need to. Think logically and do not involve students in their parents’ affairs. While a few relationships have worked out successfully in the past, many have not. Be mindful of that.” She dismissed them all to get ready for the students to show up. It was the same speech every year, though it hit harder this year for a large population of the faculty.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia pulled Alice aside with a knowing smile. “Remember what I’ve told you, while Jen’s not a parent, it could still affect things. I’m happy for you, but you are both hard-headed and stubborn.” She squeezed Alice’s arm and walked toward where Rio spoke with another science teacher.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia pulled Rio aside, a hand on her shoulder, “May and December are not that much different,” then the older woman walked away without another word.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What the fuck does that mean?” Rio asked as Alice came up beside her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t understand half of what that woman says, and I’ve been here for ten years,” Alice replied. “Oh well, off to start the day.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh! Alice, I forgot to tell you. I’m going with you to the beach weekend! Happy first day of school!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was easily the most excited about Rio joining them for the upcoming holiday weekend. However, she was also perplexed as she sat in her living room the last week of August with Jen and Nat. Alice and Rio were teaching, and Agatha was at a press interview.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Six bedrooms at the beach house. The boys will have the bunkroom, which isn’t a bunkroom anymore, but they’ll want to all stay together. Vision and I.” Her eyes darted down as she said it, hands fidgeting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had been looking at her phone, but Nat caught her look and lightly brushed her fingertips down her arm in comfort, eliciting a tense smile from Wanda before she continued her bedroom planning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nat, you have your room. Jen, do you and Alice want to share a room?” She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen’s eyes shot up. “Umm, we’re not..but yes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s smile widened slightly, happy someone had figured it out at least. “Finally. That leaves Agatha in her room and…damn, that’s just enough rooms with no way to force her and Rio to share a room.” Wanda had been hoping to force Rio and Agatha to room together, but unfortunately, she and Agatha had bought a large house all those years ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen shrugged. “They’ve had four movie nights, we’ve been present at two of them, and they usually end up falling asleep in the same room or on each other anyway. They’re comfortable together and have barely known each other for a month.” She reminded her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s like a year in lesbian time!” Wanda whined.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat fully put her hand on Wanda’s arm, looking at her softly. That look conveyed more than Nat’s words did. “I know you want Aggie to find someone, but give it a bit more time, okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. Jen looked from Nat to Wanda and back. “If you try to force Agatha too much, she’ll rebel,” Jen added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I agree with Jen,” Nat stared at Wanda. “You know she’s right.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. “Fine, but that doesn’t mean I’ll stop nudging.” She chewed on her lip and looked at Nat. “I want her to have…to be…” She whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen watched the interaction between Wanda and Nat carefully. Wanda was quickly spiraling, and Jen knew it was only a matter of time. She jotted down a few notes and sighed. “I’m going to head to the office. I have a few contract negotiations to handle. Have a good afternoon.” She waved and left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Upon hearing the door click behind Jen, Nat pulled Wanda into her, an arm around her waist. Wanda laid her head on Nat’s shoulder, eyes darting to the clock to gauge how much time they had. Nat pressed her lips to Wanda’s temple.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Talk to me dragostea mea, my love,” Nat whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda relaxed into Nat, careful to watch the time. Always aware of the time. “I don’t know how much longer I can do this, Natasha. Something has to change, and I still don’t know what to do.” Her fingers drew circles on Nat’s arm as she tried to keep her breathing steady. This was not a new conversation for them, and it was becoming more frequent.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat caressed Wanda’s cheek, her brows furrowed. Nat would always respect Wanda’s decisions, even if they did rip at her heart. “Have you talked to Agatha? Told her where you’re at?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shook her head. “You know what she would say, and my therapist isn’t helpful, and no, I haven’t talked to anyone else. Everyone’s too close to us, Nat. They will all say the same thing.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat knew they would. She was selfishly counting on it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat curled her index finger under Wanda’s chin and tilted it up, their eyes meeting. “Sunshine, I…” She was cut off when they heard the front door open, and they flew apart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Afternoon, Darling!” Vision called, ruining the moment.

      The first few weeks of school had gone well. Rio was getting to know her students well and building relationships with them and the other parents. So far, no shenanigans had been started by Nicky or Tommy, and Billy was a great kid. Labor Day weekend had finally arrived, and she was excited to go on this little trip with her friends, something she hadn’t had with any of her friends in San Francisco. She enjoyed their weekend movie nights, no matter who joined, dinners with Alice during the week, and Jennifer, who was starting to dine with them too. Rio knew that this weekend at the Wagatha beach house was going to be both memorable and fun. They were all headed up to Malibu that evening and would return Monday afternoon.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the final bell rang, Rio grabbed her things and met Alice in the hall as they walked towards her car, as it had been Rio’s week to drive.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you excited to stay in the massive beach house all weekend?” Alice asked, knocking her shoulder into Rio’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s not what I’m excited about. I’m excited to spend time with this forged family you’ve roped me into.” Rio responded with a grin. It was true. That’s what this felt like.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She and Alice had always been family, but she was happy it had expanded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice smiled back. “It’s always a fun weekend. You’re going to love it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They stopped by the apartment to change and load the car. Rio set everything out for Raven, who was being taken care of by Morgan Stark, Pepper, and Tony’s daughter. Though she didn’t know Morgan all that well yet, Agatha had said that she was very trustworthy, even if Tony was her father. There was apparently history there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio trusted Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Raven, be good for Morgan, okay?” Raven yawned in return.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they drove toward Malibu, Rio scrolled through socials and noticed several posts on Agatha’s subreddit mentioning how no one had seen her out. She closed out of Reddit and opened her music app.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is it weird that Agatha hasn’t been out and about? She hasn’t gone out partying, hasn’t been seen making poor decisions, none of the normal Agatha Harkness behavior.” Rio asked casually as she scrolled through the ‘Beach Weekend’ playlist she had made.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shrugged. “She goes through periods, especially as Nicky gets older. Maybe she’s deciding to tone it down, finally. Or she’s just gone through all of Hollywood and doesn’t want to corrupt all of the newer talent.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t know. I know it hasn’t been that long, but Reddit is noticing, and it won’t be long before the rest of social media and the media in general start picking up on it soon.” Rio mused. No, it wasn’t odd for people to change, but Agatha had been the same for decades.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      However, the more Rio learned about Agatha over the past few weeks, the more she saw her for who she was. This would be a major public persona change, and people would notice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While it didn’t bother Rio, she noticed the change.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice was quick to change the subject. “Jen and I are sharing a room.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course you are. I’d be more surprised if you weren’t.” Rio responded with a smile. “Just, don’t be too loud.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please. We are not there yet.” Not that she didn’t want to be, but they weren’t rushing anything, especially not at beach weekend. It was like having sex while on vacation with your parents.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Whatever you say. You’re already going painfully slow for lesbians.” Rio reminded her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And you’re not? At this point, Jen and I should have kids, you and Agatha should have U-Hauled, and Nat and Wanda...well. That’s…” She trailed off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Am I the ONLY PERSON that doesn’t know that story?” She asked, frustrated. “I mean, obviously, something is going on. I am a lesbian with eyes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nat, Wanda, and Agatha are the only ones who know everything,” Alice looked over at Rio for a moment as she continued down the highway. “The boys have no idea, I don’t think. I’m not sure how much Vision really knows. If it’s just that his wife isn’t completely honest with him, or if there’s an unspoken agreement. Jen and I don’t know everything, just what we’ve seen. There’s something there, though. I think the whole Wagatha thing is to keep the public from figuring out what’s truly going on.” Alice shook her head, a slightly sad expression on her face. “They’ll share when they’re ready if they ever are. For now, Nat protects both of them, and they all have a dynamic that works,” she finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio pouted a bit before letting out a resigned sigh. “It’s starting to make sense why Wanda is so invested in wanting everyone else around her to be happy when she clearly isn’t.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>

     </span>
</p>

<p>
<span>
      Dinner had been eaten, rooms sorted, and luggage settled. They were on the beach around a bonfire. Tommy and Nicky were throwing a football around; Vision, Billy, Nat, and Wanda were pointing out stars and constellations to each other; Alice and Jen were catching each other up on the week, and Rio was taking it all in. Agatha came up next to her and handed her a bottle of some mixed alcohol, and sat next to her. Agatha wore shorts over a swimsuit with her hair down. Rio, dressed similarly, nodded her thanks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Without thinking, Rio automatically remarked. “I’ve noticed your weekends haven’t exactly been your usual style recently.” She flinched as she said it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just gave a wry smile. “Even Hollywood bad boys are allowed to take a break. Besides, Jen needed a break. She was about to have a stroke spinning everything and cleaning up my messes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “I can only imagine. The woman could be a fixer for the mafia at this point.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not that bad,” Agatha responded with a huff.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Depending on which website you read.” Rio smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Which ones are you reading?” Agatha asked, meeting Rio’s eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Brown eyes met blue, really seeing Agatha. “I don’t believe everything I read.” She replied softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh? And what do you believe?” Agatha asked, the noise around her fading. All she was focused on was Rio’s answer. Sometime in the last month, this woman’s opinion had become almost as important to her as Wanda’s. It was something she couldn’t quite put into words yet, but the gravity of it was not lost on her. She had stopped truly caring about what the public thought of her personal life, relationship-wise, years ago. Yet here she was staring into the eyes of this younger woman who had captivated her since the moment they’d been re-introduced, hanging on her every word, finding that the next few minutes were either going to destroy her or give her a hope that she hadn’t had in decades.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I see you, Agatha,” Rio responded and was about to continue when a shout interrupted the moment as a redhead crashed into them, catching a rogue football.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha swore. She could murder her son.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sorry, Mom! Sorry, Rio!” Nicky shouted. They had all agreed that the boys could call Rio by her first name when they weren’t at school, just like they did with Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat rolled off both of them. “Sorry. I didn’t think either of you wanted a black eye.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There are worse ways to go than death by redhead, Natasha. It’s fine.” Rio replied, standing up, her drink spilled all over her, and the moment was lost. “Thank you for the save.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had fixed the expression on her face and mumbled her thanks as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think I’m going to go shower and head to bed,” Agatha said, standing and heading off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Several others also took that moment to excuse themselves and call it a night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn’t exactly sure what she had been about to say, but she had done a lot of thinking about this
     </span>
<span>
      developing friendship and Agatha herself
     </span>
<span>
      in the past few weeks, telling herself that Agatha’s behavioral changes had absolutely nothing to do with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Returning to her assigned guest room, Rio readied herself for bed. She showered and lay down in the luxuriously comfortable bed, alone.  It shouldn’t have bothered her, but she knew what the odd energetic feeling in her chest was.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       It’s just a crush,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      she told herself.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Nothing to get that worked up over, and nothing to be done about.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I don’t date parents,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      her thoughts continued as she let sleep overcome her,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       even if they’re her…

      Thank you so much to my lovely Beta! She's been helping me flesh things out and reminding me that people cannot read my mind.

<span>
       Labor Day Weekend
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was early. The sun had yet to rise, and the two redheads were only up because they had gone for a run on the beach,
     </span>
<span>
      their daily runs something they had established when they were eighteen
     </span>
<span>
      . They sat on one of the back decks looking out over the ocean, drinking coffee and enjoying the cool morning breeze. Wanda enjoyed these mornings with Natasha when they could be alone. Their chairs were pushed together, and they knew no one else would be up for at least another hour. They still wouldn’t risk it and would part ways to shower shortly after finishing their coffee, but they enjoyed the fleeting moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda held Nat’s hand and ran her thumb over her knuckles. She was careful, knowing that her husband and sons were in the house behind them.
     </span>
<span>
      She wasn’t worried so much about Vision. It was the boys.
     </span>
<span>
      She sighed as she dropped the other woman’s hand and wrapped it around her coffee mug. “Jen and Alice have gotten their shit together, it seems.”
     </span>
<span>
      Wanda let her native accent slip through.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded. “Thanks to Rio for giving the final push. That only took
     </span>
<span>
      ten
     </span>
<span>
      years.”
     </span>
<span>
      She set her empty mug down and placed her hand on Wanda’s thigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded, “Now for the other two. What else can we do? How can we get them into a one-bed situation? Stranded? Forced proximity? Jen already nixed fake dating.” She rattled off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why don’t we just give it time, sunshine? They’re just getting to know each other and are already draw
     </span>
<span>
      n to each other. It’s going to work out.” Nat replied. She felt bad for breaking up their moment last night, and at least wanted to back off for the weekend.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If I can’t be completely happy, everyone else is going to be, fuck.” Wanda bit back, bitterly, fire in her eyes. The more time passed, the worse things got for her situation, it seemed. No amount of stardom, therapy, or money could fix that. She had traded her soul and happiness for this life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey,” Nat knew Wanda
     </span>
<span>
      was unraveling, and until Wanda made a decision, it was better to validate and change the subject.
     </span>
<span>
      “You fixed the football schedule to where they’re working the concession stand together for a quarter of each home game, Jen will make it so Rio goes to the premiere as her date, we
     </span>
<span>
      won’t always be at movie nights
     </span>
<span>
      , you’re going to plant it in Agatha’s head to take Rio to SNL when she hosts, AND the Halloween party. That’s a lot of forced proximity.” She pointed out, her own accent rather prominent. Dropping their American accents around each other was something they had been doing
     </span>
<span>
      since they were teenagers
     </span>
<span>
      , another layer of intimacy between them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Their accents would slip through occasionally with the others, but not like this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. “I know. I’m just worried that we’re going to be traveling a lot soon, and they won’t be together as much.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A grin formed on the former assassin's lips as she turned to look at Wanda. “Then you either get Agatha to send her flowers, or you do it. Or plants, we know Rio has a green thumb. Talk to Alice. You also make sure she’s calling, texting, whatever, daily. Since Rio is here now, that means we have Alice and Rio join us for the holidays, and if, for some idiot reason, they STILL aren’t together by winter, we send them up to the cabin together, and all make excuses as to why the rest of us can’t go. Manifest a blizzard. Oh! Rio loves music! Get Agatha to take her to some concerts, pull some strings. You’re crafty, Wanda.
     </span>
<span>
      We’ll figure it out, together, like we always do.
     </span>
<span>
      I’m going to shower
     </span>
<span>
      before everyone wakes up.” Nat stood and kissed Wanda on the crown of her head, deliberately ignoring the cameras on the perimeter of the house, before walking inside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda closed her eyes and sighed as she went to take their cups inside and get ready for the day herself, focusing on the plan she had previously come up with.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As everyone else woke up for the day, they gathered in the kitchen, various adults making breakfast. Vision and the boys would be taking the boat out to go fishing, Wanda decided that she, Nat, Jen, and Alice would go into town, and she suggested that Rio and Agatha remain at the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why, exactly, should we stay at the house?” Agatha asked, eyebrows high on her forehead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Someone needs to stay here in case something happens to us on the boat. Someone always stays back.” Vision piped up as he loaded a cooler. He knew his wife well and
     </span>
<span>
      knew when she was meddling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha glanced over at him. “That’s why you have someone going with you, we have a guy at the house, and what the actual Coast Guard is for.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I would prefer to stay at the house, but you don’t have to stay with me. I have been told that I’m an adult.” Rio said, poking her tongue in her cheek absentmindedly as she leaned against the kitchen island, drinking her coffee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha almost immediately changed her mind, but she didn’t want to give Wanda the satisfaction. “I guess I can stay, but only because I don’t want to be on the pier on the last weekend of summer,” Agatha huffed and rolled her eyes, acting annoyed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s settled then!” Wanda clapped her hands together. “Everyone disperse!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision and the boys left shortly after, and the four women headed into Malibu. Rio and Agatha changed into swimwear. Then, Rio grabbed her beach bag, waving at Agatha as she went down to the private beach.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had a decision to make. Stay poolside or go down to the beach with Rio, and one sounded much more inviting than the other, which is how she found herself moments later sitting under the large beach umbrella where they had sat that first night at the party roughly a month ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled as she turned a page of the book she was reading. “Careful, Agatha, Wanda might think her meddling is working.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda needs to worry about her own shit. She won’t, but she needs to,” Agatha said as she situated herself and looked over at her companion for the day. They both had on sunglasses.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Probably for the best.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She smirked to herself. “What’re you reading?” Agatha asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lesbian smut,” Rio responded, face deadpan, her eyes cutting to the side to see Agatha’s reaction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sucked in a breath. “Good smut, I hope.” She replied, side-eyeing her friend as well.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Fuck Harkness. FRIENDS. Stop trying to get in her bikini bottoms, s
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      he thought to herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know what I’ll be doing later.” Rio teased.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Fuck, Vidal. You’re just FRIENDS. Stop flirting. You know where this leads.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Her inner alarm went off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Thankfully, Agatha barely caught herself before making any slightly embarrassing sounds and quickly changed the subject. “SO, the first football game is coming up…” She said, face red.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took the cue as they went back to safer territory. “Yes, we’re working concessions together on Friday. Wanda’s doing, I’m sure. We’re working all the home games together.” She knew that was all Wanda and Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew it, too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She means well,” Agatha replied. “She wants to see me, and everyone around her, happy. She throws herself into her work, her kids, her friends, and the school. Anything and everything she can.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Everyone except herself? She does realize that you, her best friend and sister, are gay and living your best life, right?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Am I?” Agatha asked. “She’s still worried about how it would affect everything she’s built. Once I hit 16, I built my career on being America’s Lesbian Sweetheart. She was America’s
     </span>
<span>
      Imported
     </span>
<span>
      Straight Sweetheart.
     </span>
<span>
      The girl-next-door,
     </span>
<span>
      ”
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha sighed
     </span>
<span>
      . “Nope. Not my story to tell,
     </span>
<span>
      even though I was there
     </span>
<span>
      . Wanda wants the best for me, and by extension, you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled. “Well, so far, I have gained what feels like an entire family, and I don’t feel weird and starstruck around the two of you anymore. It does suck that Nat’s off-limits though. She’s hot.” She shot Agatha a devilish grin as Agatha rolled her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s not off limits, but she refuses to date. Wanda would
     </span>
<span>
      make sure we never found your body, though.
     </span>
<span>
      ”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded solemnly, “I believe
     </span>
<span>
      it.
     </span>
<span>
      ”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed. “That woman is feisty, and we have had a lot of training over the years.” She looked out at the ocean and back at Rio. “Going back to concession duty for football games. How do you feel about having to serve hot dogs?” She asked, already plotting something.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wrinkled her nose. “Eww. I’d rather not.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha jumped to her feet and shed her shorts and sunglasses. “The last one waist-deep in the ocean, is on hot dog duty.” As she darted off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “NOT FAIR HARKNESS!” Rio shouted as she scrambled to her feet and chased after her, taking her shorts and glasses off as she ran.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hit the water first and turned around to watch Rio, feeling the refreshingly cold water hit her skin as she slowly walked backward to let the younger woman catch up a bit. Agatha could admit she had played dirty, but that’s how she liked it. “Come on, kid! You can do better than that!” She shouted over the waves, turning back around. She was only knee-deep, and Rio was catching up. The water was up to her thighs when Rio jumped on her back, and they both went down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha yelped as she hit her knees and got a mouthful of saltwater. Rio was still wrapped around her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I AM VICTORIOUS!” Rio cried as Agatha spat out the ocean water.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned back laughing, dunking Rio in the ocean. Rio tightened her grip around her neck and took Agatha down with her as they both went under the water and rolled over. Rio finally unwrapped herself from Agatha, and they came back up, sputtering and laughing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Technically, I hit the water first. I win,” Agatha said, continuing to cough up water and laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Only because you cheated, bitch.” Rio responded, splashing water up at the other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, is that how we’re playing this now?” Agatha teased as she splashed back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The two women splashed and chased each other, reliving a childhood neither really had. They were closer to the shore when Agatha pounced on Rio. This time, it was Rio who yelped in surprise and went down. They rolled in the water for the second time, coming to a stop with Rio on top of Agatha. Rio was straddling her hips, hands on either side of her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Truce?” Rio asked, keeping her pinned down, grinning madly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Truce!” Agatha laughed. The water was shallow enough that it wasn’t going over her face, but her hair floated a bit around her. “We'll make whoever is working with us do hot dogs.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Perfect,” Rio replied softly. It was then that Rio realized their positioning but didn’t immediately move. She studied Agatha’s face, and her gaze fell to her lips.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       This would be the perfect moment. Nope. Parent. Danger Will Robinson. Abort. Remove self. Rise. Move.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She didn’t.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up, searching Rio’s eyes and seeing the conflict happening. She knew she should make some snide remark and push Rio off her. Splash her. Ruin the moment. SOMETHING. This was dangerous. But instead, “You’re perfect,” escaped in a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was a long moment before Rio’s body finally responded to her brain. She stood up, shattering the moment. “I’m hungry. Are you hungry? We should eat something.” The whisper still echoing in her ears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha closed her mouth, still ajar in shock at her own declaration, and sat up, shaking her head to clear it. “Yes, good idea. I also need to wash the sand and ocean out of my hair.
     </span>
<span>
      Have to take care of it or Jen will kill me.
     </span>
<span>
      ”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio held out her hand to help her up. “So it’s true then, and not just made up? Your hair really is insured?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Absolutely.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What’s the real amount? I’ve seen everything from one million to one billion,” Rio inquired out of curiosity as Agatha took her hand and stood, the two immediately putting a few feet in between themselves.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Twenty million with various stipulations for maintenance, coloring, that kind of thing. I cut it on a whim without permission when I was sixteen, the smallest piece. Thankfully, it was 1989, and not everything was so monitored. I was due for maintenance anyway,” Agatha shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And the locket?” Rio asked. “I heard that was insured too, which makes sense, but wasn’t it just a random thrift store find?” Rio had read about it in a few interviews. Agatha always said it was something she had found while out with friends, and it was one of the bigger mysteries surrounding her persona. They walked back to their spot under the umbrella.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, but I’ve grown attached. It now has a GPS chip on it, so I never lose it. It’s truly irreplaceable and priceless. Yes, it’s insured, though I don’t tell anyone how much.” Agatha didn’t currently have it on, it was in a safe within a safe, inside a wall safe in the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Understandable.” Rio nodded. She could tell from the tone of Agatha’s voice not to ask any more questions about it. She had seen it on Agatha on multiple occasions, and it was even more beautiful and detailed up close. Rio did not ask her what was in it, and no one knew.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The early afternoon sun shone brightly as they gathered their things and headed back up to the house. Wanda had texted that the Malibu group wouldn’t be getting back until dinner time, and they knew the fishing group wouldn’t get home until later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What’s for lunch, chef?” Agatha asked as they walked into the kitchen, setting her things on the breakfast table. They would shower after eating, and frolicking in the ocean had left her hungry in more ways than one, but Agatha could only do so much.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio followed suit and looked in the fridge. “Spaghetti leftovers from last night, Your Highness.” She replied, taking out containers. “Grab plates, will you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha feigned shock, placing her open hand in the middle of her chest. “Par-don?” She emphasized the word. “Moi? What if I break a nail?” She asked, dramatically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed and rolled her eyes. “Oh, please, you keep your nails short for other activities, and you just spent the morning playing in the Pacific.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled a genuine smile that reached her eyes. The smile that Rio had been seeing a lot lately, whenever they bantered like this. Agatha turned and got the plates.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha couldn’t remember the last time something had come this easily to her, this back and forth, this closeness. Not since Wanda, and that had been more of a trauma bond, and immediately developed into a protective feeling. Even with the other women she was close to, it had taken her longer to develop this close of a relationship. There was her original coven,
     </span>
<span>
      but that didn’t exist anymore.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The first night she and Rio had really talked, she had wanted to bare her soul to her. A little over a month, and they had already developed an easy back and forth. Yes, there was some flirting, but they would eventually tamp that down. Agatha was just naturally flirty, after all. It was harmless.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They ate, cleaned up, and went to shower separately. When Agatha came back down, she wore an oversized purple Malibu t-shirt and black lounge shorts. Long, dark brown, damp hair pulled back in a ponytail. Rio was already on the couch with her book. Her hair was pulled up, and her dark green tank top showed that her skin had darkened a bit in the sun. She wore black bike shorts that had some type of leaf pattern on them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How’s your smut?” Agatha asked as she sat down on the other end of the couch with her Kindle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hot. I miss sex.” Rio responded automatically.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Drown yourself in the ocean, Vidal.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She groaned inwardly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chuckled. “Same.”
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Play in traffic, Harkness,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      she thought. “I can leave you alone to read if you prefer.” She added, face red.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. “No, I prefer your company."
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Do they make something for verbal diarrhea?
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      “It’s funny, as a teenager, growing up with Lorna Wu's daughter, I would have killed to be close friends with huge megastars. Now that I am, I forget you guys are even famous. You’re just normal people,” She looked up at Agatha, adding, “With more money than God.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha couldn’t help but give a small laugh, “It’s a downtime for us. There are times when there are paparazzi and cameras everywhere, names splashed all over the media, and then there are the quiet times like right now. I’m sure pictures will show up tomorrow of Wanda around Malibu, but nothing huge. Just ‘Wanda Maximoff enjoying a weekend with friends’, hopefully. A few of the lesbian Twitter accounts will probably say something about Nat being there and not Vision. Jen will have it scrubbed. Then, a few of the accounts that are obsessed with Jen will say something about Jen and Alice, but that’s it. Someone will mention my absence, and we’ll continue like normal. We both try to act as down-to-earth as possible because we are. We still have our diva moments and definitely did when we were younger, but we have an example to set.” She explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took it all in. She chewed on her lip for a minute and took a deep breath before finally asking the question that had been on her mind for, years, now that she thought about it. “Agatha, why, exactly, don’t you date seriously?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Pass,” Agatha replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, come on. We’ve shared a lot of things.” Rio huffed, trying to see past the neutral facade that Agatha was now wearing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why won’t you date parents?” Agatha countered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Point taken.” Rio was about to ask Agatha about
     </span>
<span>
      the faint scars she had noticed on her leg and back earlier
     </span>
<span>
      when the front door opened and their friends walked in. Rio hadn’t realized that it was already evening, meaning the fishing group would be back soon as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The Malibu group had brought pizza, and the fishing group returned with nothing except sunburns and fish tales. They were around the fire again, talking and roasting marshmallows, when Wanda decided it was time to interfere.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “As we all know, our movie premieres mid-October,” Wanda said, silencing everyone, garnering a few looks. “Agatha, you should bring Rio.” She added, before taking a drink of whatever concoction she had.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      All eyes turned to the two women who had previously been discussing musical interests. Rio choked on her water.
     </span>
<span>
      Maybe she needed to just stop drinking anything around this group when they were speaking.
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha glared at her best friend. If looks could kill, Wanda would have burst into flames.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s still two months…” Agatha started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Six weeks,” Nat clarified.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Isn’t that a school night?” Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’re on fall break then,” Alice informed her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How convenient,” Agatha and Rio muttered simultaneously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The twins and I can’t go see the movie. Our moms get naked,” Nicky supplied, matter-of-factly, as he popped a marshmallow in his mouth before either Rio or Agatha said anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mom is taking Dad,” the twins added as they each set a marshmallow on fire.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I prefer to stay out of the spotlight, but occasionally I am forced into it.” Vision’s expression was dour, a rarity for him. “I’m an introvert at heart,” he added quickly, his normal, easy smile returning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We need to go ahead and set it now to coordinate what you’re wearing,” Jen finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda watched Agatha and Rio carefully. Wanda knew what every look, glance, twitch, and eye sparkle from Agatha meant. They could quite literally have entire conversations without saying a word.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She watched Agatha look at Rio, the question in her eyes. Do you want to come with me?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was an easy one, surely Rio could catch that one, thought Wanda. She looked towards Rio, watching the young teacher tilt her head as if responding to Agatha's unspoken question. Both broke out in a subtle smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was delighted to see this silent exchange. It had taken Agatha and Wanda years to develop their connection. It had taken Agatha and Rio a month.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Soulmates!
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had called it. She couldn’t wait to send a text later..
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’d love to go. I think it will be fun to tag along as your plus one.” Rio finally said aloud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Great!” Said Wanda, ignoring the added comment. She turned to look at the boys, “It’s getting late. Go shower and head off to bed. We’re just going to talk shop for a bit.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They groaned but knew she meant to just go inside and play video games or something. “Yes, ma’am.” They replied. Vision took that as his cue as well. “I will make sure they don’t burn the house down, Darling. He kissed Wanda’s forehead and stood. The boys hugged their moms and aunts, said goodnight to the others, and went inside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, schedules for the next few months.” Wanda started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Agatha exchanged looks before Rio turned to Wanda. “This doesn’t involve Alice or me…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda cut her off, “Yes, it does, stay.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio remained where she sat and pulled out her phone, opening the Calendar app. She had a feeling it was about to fill up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “In addition to school happenings, what else do we have, Jen?” Wanda started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jennifer cleared her throat. They had planned all of this out on their trip. Go over their schedules for the next few months and push Agatha into inviting Rio at least to the premiere, New York for SNL, and the Halloween party. That would at least get them to November. Maybe by then, they’d know each other well enough to at least kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You two have talk shows around LA, and a few NY appearances, especially the closer we get to October. Wanda, your SNL episode is at the end of September, and Nat will go with you. Agatha, yours is the weekend after the premiere.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Agatha. “Who’s your musical guest?” Rio asked quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled, mischief in her eyes. She already knew the reaction she was about to get. “Chap…” She didn’t get to finish before Rio squealed. “Want to come?” She asked when Rio stopped. She shrieked a yes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen nodded and put it down. Wanda smirked, she knew what that response was going to be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then there’s the annual Halloween party. Wanda, costumes?” Jen asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think Billy is going with his ‘friend’ Eddie
     </span>
<span>
      Wilson, Sam Wilson’s son
     </span>
<span>
      . Tommy and Nicky will probably go as zombies, right, Aggie?”
     </span>
<span>
      Wanda
     </span>
<span>
      asked, as Agatha nodded. That was their current thing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Vision and I are doing Glinda and Fiyero from Wicked.” Wanda finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha snorted, laughing as Wanda gave her a sharp look. Agatha mumbled something about Rio saying something funny, and Rio nodded conspiratorially.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Alice and I are going as Xena and Gabby,” Jen said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t you need…” Agatha started before a graham cracker connected with the side of her head. She turned to see Wanda looking around innocently. Instead, she muttered something about them making such a gay choice
     </span>
<span>
      and picking graham cracker out of her hair.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jennifer smirked and looked at Nat. “What about you? Are you and Agatha doing something?
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha letting you borrow the Elphaba costume, perhaps?
     </span>
<span>
      ”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat shook her head. “No. I decided to be on duty that night and not dress up.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha automatically threw her hands up. “She volunteered, I swear.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded. “I want to have eyes on all the camera screens
     </span>
<span>
      in The Tower
     </span>
<span>
      make sure all your drunk asses are safe,” she said with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen nodded with a glance at Wanda, who was suddenly very interested in picking at her shorts. She looked back at Agatha. “Alright, Agatha?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up and then over at Rio. “Want to go to the Halloween party and wear some ridiculous coordinated costume with me?” She asked, keeping her face neutral.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, stilling her face as well. “Yes, want to do Wheel of Time?” It was a series they both loved that only they watched.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course,” Agatha replied. She thought about it for a second. “I’ll be Moirane…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio finished quickly, not wanting to be cast as the love interest, “I’ll be Lanfear.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded, somewhat disappointed that Rio would go as her nemesis.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       For the best, though, she’ll be hit on all night.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She thought, but what did it matter to her?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen just nodded, inputting it all into her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I shared the calendar with everyone. Just to make life easier. In reality, Jen knew it would put everyone’s mind at peace if they knew where everyone was. The collective amount of trauma, trust, and abandonment issues in this group was staggering.

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That night, Rio lay in the guest bed, unable to sleep. It was extremely comfortable, and her sleep playlist was on, but she just couldn’t get her mind to turn off. The conversation around the fire replayed in her mind. Everything had happened so fast. She knew she couldn’t talk to Alice about it right now, which also ruled out Jen. Wanda was stuck in her own personal ‘Good Luck, Babe’, and had orchestrated everything,
     </span>
<span>
      most likely to distract herself
     </span>
<span>
      . Nat was probably conversing with the security that Rio knew were crawling around the property, plus she would do whatever Wanda wanted. She sighed. The person Rio needed to talk to was the one she wanted to talk to the most.  She just had to trust herself and not throw herself at Agatha. There was just something about Agatha Harkness that she could get lost in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio
     </span>
<span>
      looked at her phone, one in the morning. “Worth a shot,” she breathed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Me:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Hey, are you awake?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She waited to see if the three dots showed up. A few minutes went by, and nothing. Rio sighed, resigning herself to a sleepless night when her door opened and closed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes. I am.” A familiar voice said as the bed shifted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Very presumptuous of you to just crawl into bed with me,” Rio said with a nervous smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please, we snuggle on the couch most movie nights,” Agatha responded, making herself comfortable.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was right, and Rio didn’t mind. She felt like they had known each other for longer than they had, and Rio had grown accustomed to falling asleep
     </span>
<span>
      near
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha every Saturday night,
     </span>
<span>
      which was four, but who was counting?
     </span>
<span>
      “I can’t sleep.” She whined.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes, knowing Rio couldn’t see it in the dark. “It’s all the smut you’ve been reading.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It is not,” Rio sighed, “I keep thinking about what happened earlier and how you were kind of forced to invite me to everything. You don’t have to, you know.”
     </span>
<span>
      Rio offered Agatha an out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What if I want to? What if I don’t want to take someone else to a premiere? Or to New York? As a friend, of course. No one else will do Wheel of Time with me for Halloween, and you will have women all over you in whatever Lanfear costume we come up with.” Agatha replied sincerely. She could handle whatever happened at the Halloween party just fine.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       You’re lying to yourself.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      “I’ll be your wingwoman,” She added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled, her nerves dying down, knowing that Agatha hadn’t felt obligated. “Okay, as long as you didn’t feel forced.”
     </span>
<span>
      She didn’t comment on the wing-woman remark. While Rio knew that was the better option, she also already knew it wasn’t what she really wanted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please, kid, no one forces me to do anything.” Agatha scoffed. She was thankful for the darkness of the room, as she knew her eyes had drifted to Rio’s mouth.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Just friends who had spent the past month of Saturday nights together. You have shared a bed with Wanda a million times. You aren’t attracted to Wanda, but it’s fine. You have slept on the same couch with this woman multiple times. You’ve platonically cuddled. A bed is no different, Harkness. Get it together. She rolled over and created a bit more space between them.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched as Agatha rolled over, and she copied the movement, so that their backs were towards each other, with several feet in between them.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       This is a bad idea. This has to be a bad idea.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She thought. The problem was that while she was hyperaware of the other woman in the bed with her, she already felt her eyelids getting heavier. Yes, the temptation was there, but so was the comfort and the ease of their relationship. She could easily fall asleep with Agatha Harkness every night.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Preferably in more of a relationship context.
      </span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
       Nicky graduates in two years.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She sighed and froze when she realized how loud it had been.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Everything okay?” Agatha asked sleepily. She had still been battling with herself, but she was an actress for a reason.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       How the fuck was she almost asleep?
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She thought. Though, her body was nodding off. “Just thinking.” Rio yawned, surprising herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I can go…” Agatha started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please don’t,” Rio said immediately.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       What the fuck? The woman is pure temptation.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      “I really am used to falling asleep near you on Saturdays. It’s what we’ve done for a few weeks now.” She added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded, “So am I. It’s just a different environment. Who are you hoping to see at the movie premiere?” They were still turned away from each other, but naming off celebrities became like counting sheep, as they drifted off to sleep.
     </span>

     </span>

<p>
<span>
      Sunday morning was a repeat of Saturday as Wanda and Nat sat at the table again after their run, drinking coffee
     </span>
<span>
      close together with careful touches and native accents.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha spent the night in Rio’s room.” Nat shared. She had been checking security footage, and a hallway camera had caught Agatha entering Rio’s room. There weren’t any cameras in private spaces, but with as many parties as they held here, they had been installed in all public spaces.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda thought about it momentarily before responding, “Nothing happened. If they had even kissed, she would have already told me.” She still smiled.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Doesn’t date teachers, indeed. We’ll see about that.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat knew Wanda was right. The two found sisters could practically read each other’s minds. It was why Agatha was the only other person who knew everything about Nat and Wanda, other than because she had been there right from the start. “Things are moving in the right direction for them if they’ll let it continue.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded as she blew out a breath, stood, and walked back into the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The Russian knew that there was no use in going after her, that Wanda was lost in her thoughts and needed a moment. Nat gathered both of their mugs and took them to the kitchen. The boys were staying at the house today, and she knew that while Wanda loved her family, she wasn’t happy about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Breakfast was the same as the day before. Everyone gathered in the kitchen, doing different things. It had been decided that everyone was spending the day at the house, out by the pool. Everyone changed into pool wear after eating and reconvened.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys goofed off and near heart attacks were had as Tommy and Nicky did flips into the pool, nearly hitting their heads multiple times.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned to Agatha, who had taken a chair next to her, “How many ER trips have those two had?” She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Surprisingly less than either of us thought they would. People know who we are regardless, however, when people know your security team and the nannies, you know it’s an issue.” Agatha recalled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio
     </span>
<span>
      blew air out of her nose.
     </span>
<span>
      ”That was still less than you thought?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Billy only had to go once or twice because he did something they told him to do,” Wanda said, as she pulled a chair up by their loungers. “The other two, though. Stitches, broken bones, and a few false alarms. They’ve calmed down a lot, but still, they think they’re invincible.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Which is why I have to do PR clean up for them too,” Jen added in, as she and Alice joined the group, Nat, behind them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Which is also why Vision is teaching them all to drive, he’s the safest and most patient of everyone,” Nat said as she sat in a chair beside Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As it was, Vision was having a discussion with Billy while yelling something about angles and rotations at Tommy and Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed, “He tries, but those two are not applying physics to their recklessness right now.” Wanda nodded as she looked affectionately at Vision, and then over at Nat, who was in deep conversation with Alice and Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stood and sat on the edge of the pool with her legs
     </span>
<span>
      in the water
     </span>
<span>
      . Billy had gone off to take turns jumping in with the other boys. Vision stood next to Rio and started a conversation, and she took the opportunity to get to know more about him. He was an astrophysicist at UCLA and had met Wanda on a set when he was consulting. They had fallen in love and gotten married, according to him. Rio did see the love there and didn’t doubt that at all, though she still wondered about the full story.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shared about her love of plants and all things science, loudly mentioning the upcoming quiz on Tuesday.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m giving a quiz on Tuesday, too.” Vision laughed. “Evil teachers unite.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Here, here!” Alice said from where she sat, overhearing the conversation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re all so mean!” Wanda shouted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve been studying for Alice and Rio’s classes while we’ve been here,” Billy said, before jumping in the pool.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll probably fail,” Tommy said, shrugging.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m just going to wing it, but I paid attention,” Nicky said before he pushed Tommy in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had snuck up behind Nicky, “You’re such a brat.” She said before pushing him in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey! That’s my son!” Agatha said, having snuck up behind Jen and pushing her in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn’t remember the last time she felt like this. Happy, surrounded by people she cared about. She stood up to get a drink when Agatha tried to push her in, too, but she grabbed on to her and pulled her in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Didn’t you learn your lesson yesterday, Harkness? If I’m going down, so are you.” She laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda almost gave herself whiplash. “What happened yesterday?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just grinned. “Ocean shenanigans.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen sighed loudly, “Keep it out of the media.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky groaned. “Mom.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head. “Nothing happened, and you all
     </span>
<span>
      need to get your minds out of the gutter
     </span>
<span>
      .”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat bit her tongue, so tempted to add that someone slept in someone else’s bed last night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys went in after lunch to play video games, and Vision joined them. He had been around this group to know they enjoyed their time together, and he did not enjoy the girl talk.
     </span>
<span>
      He also had a book to read, essays to grade, football to watch, and his own friend to talk to while he did all of that.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April and Jen went upstairs, muttering about a nap
     </span>
<span>
      while the other four women remained poolside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat finally let
     </span>
<span>
      her secret out
     </span>
<span>
      . “So, sleeping together now?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fucking cameras.” Agatha scowled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What?” Rio looked shocked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda suppressed a laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha
     </span>
<span>
      turned her head to look at
     </span>
<span>
      Rio. “There are cameras in the public areas of the house since we have so many events here,” she explained. “Ms. Head of Security, here, must have been checking them.” She added, eyes darting over at Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nothing happened. I couldn’t sleep because I felt like SOMEONE,” Rio cut her eyes at Wanda, “had pressured Agatha into inviting me to things, so I texted to see if she was awake. She came to my room instead of texting, we talked and fell asleep. That’s it.” she explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You do not have to explain anything to these two busybodies. We are grown adults and friends. Close friends and nothing more.” Agatha glared at Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda put her hands up
     </span>
<span>
      in defense
     </span>
<span>
      . “I didn’t say a single thing. It was the other redheaded demon this time.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat
     </span>
<span>
      grinned wildly
     </span>
<span>
      . “Hey, I’m allowed to create trouble now and then. We’ll see how long the two of you remain friends. I’m going to check cameras and do my job.” She said as she got up, eyes lingering on Wanda before she left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio scoffed. “You two aren’t very subtle.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Neither are the two of you.” She shot back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio bit her tongue before she said anything else. She didn’t have anything against Wanda and didn’t want to hurt her. She could tell that whatever the situation was, it was painful and tearing her apart. Instead, she reached over and put a hand on her shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If you ever need to talk to someone other than Agatha, or if Agatha isn’t available, I’m here. I know a few things about extremely difficult situationships.”
     </span>
<span>
      Rio’s voice was soft, and she
     </span>
<span>
      gave her a meaningful look
     </span>
<span>
      when she
     </span>
<span>
      saw the tears Wanda was trying to hold back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. “Thanks,” Wanda whispered,
     </span>
<span>
      standing to leave
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
<span>
      As she left, she gave Agatha a pointed look, bent over, and whispered, “I give you both until the new year.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head, earning a sigh from Wanda as her sister muttered something in Romanian and went inside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned to Rio.
     </span>
<span>
      “Want to play a game?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow. “What kind of game?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Get your ass in the pool and find out.” She replied as she got in herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Curious, Rio followed her. “Okay, what’s this game?” She asked as they were both treading water in the deep end.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<span>
      A little game of ‘ask me anything’.
     </span>
<span>
      We’re going to race to the opposite side and back. Whoever wins gets to ask the other a question, and they have to answer it. The questions we refused to answer yesterday are off limits, and we can’t ask about…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio cut her off, knowing what she was about to say, “Other people’s stuff. I wouldn’t. Not our stories to tell.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. “Right. Up for it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “
     </span>
<span>
      This is a trap, but
     </span>
<span>
      prepare to bare your soul, Harkness!” She exclaimed as she set up to push herself off the wall.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Whatever, kid. Ready, set, go.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They pushed off, both gliding underwater most of the way to the other side, they each got a few strokes in before flipping and pushing off the other side. Rio was only an inch taller than the older woman, so speed mattered. She touched the starting side right before Agatha did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ha! I win!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Barely!” Agatha shouted, but fine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll start easy, favorite color?” Rio already knew it, but she didn’t want to start with soul-baring questions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, come on. Purple, yours is green.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled. “Okay, then you can skip that one.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio barely won the next round. “Favorite food?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha made an annoyed face. “Rio. We each know that about each other, too. Yours is cereal, and mine is Italian, and anything you make.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smirked. She was just trying to annoy Agatha at the moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed, continuing, “We know all the basics about each other.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Our
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      favorite movie?
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The Witches Road
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . Which you don’t think is conceited on my part, because it’s a fucking good movie.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Our
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      favorite TV show?
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Sisters
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . Yours to watch, mine for memories and milestones in my career. We both prefer the mountains and almost always have some type of background noise. My first pet was a rabbit named Señor Scratchy. Raven is yours. We’ll be here forever if I start on music and books, so I think we can skip the easy questions and go a bit deeper.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s face was soft during her monologue, neither angry nor upset. She wanted,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       needed
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , Rio to understand that she had heard her and appreciated Rio, for Rio-as is.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wow, and we just met.” Rio joked, trying to lighten the moment, though the look in her eyes matched the seriousness in Agatha’s.
     </span>
<span>
      “Fine. What are those scars on your back and your leg? They’re very faint, so I’m sure you have them edited out of pictures and covered with makeup, especially the one on your leg.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded, “Good job, detective. They’re souvenirs of when Nat tried to take me out that one time. Knife down the back, bullet grazed my leg. It was all very dramatic.” She would not be telling Rio about the other scar from that night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha reached forward and used her fingertip to gently close Rio’s mouth, which had come open from shock. “I’ve lived an interesting life.
     </span>
<span>
      Let’s go again, Vidal.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This time, Agatha won. “Alright, let’s see. Most embarrassing high school moment.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, that’s brutal and not fair because you didn’t go to high school!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I also don’t have to answer.” She laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thought about it. “I had a crush on a girl and tried to let her cheat on my test in science class. Not only did I get caught, but our tests were different, so she would’ve failed anyway.” She responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Smooth.” Agatha laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was absolutely not.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio won the next round.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Worst person to work with?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Tony Stark. Completely full of himself. Pepper is great, love her. Tony is just all ego,
     </span>
<span>
      even if he is a great dad and a decent husband. Don’t ever tell him I said those things
     </span>
<span>
      .”
     </span>
<span>
      Their rivalry was well known, though as an award-winning director, they did work together frequently.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “I get that vibe. Morgan is a sweetheart of a kid, though.
     </span>
<span>
      I took your recommendation and she’s cat-sitting for me this weekend.
     </span>
<span>
      ”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled fondly at the mention of Morgan, “She and Nicky have known each other since birth, really, but have been friends since pre-k. Again, great kid.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio won again. “If you hadn’t been forced into acting, what would you have wanted to do?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha
     </span>
<span>
      bit her lip, deep in thought, and mulled over the question for a moment, putting one hand on her hip and lightly gripping the lip of the pool with the other, while treading water. She finally looked back at Rio, an eyebrow raised
     </span>
<span>
      . “You know, I have never thought about it. Hollywood has been my entire life. Even if I were to retire, I’m set and could just do charity work, some business, whatever I wanted. I never had that childhood ‘when I grow up’ dream.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked somewhat lost, and Rio felt for her. Neither of them had a
     </span>
<span>
      traditional
     </span>
<span>
      childhood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I never had unrealistic career goals.”
     </span>
<span>
      Rio’s fingertips barely gripped the edge of the pool. “
     </span>
<span>
      I never dreamed of being a rocket scientist or an astronaut. It was always a teacher, something that was practical and doable.
     </span>
<span>
      Something that even someone from the neighborhoods I lived in could get a scholarship and do.
     </span>
<span>
      I was good at science, and while there were other things I could do with that, teaching was the most achievable.
     </span>
<span>
      Even though I grew up an unofficial Wu, it still made the most sense. Again, it's not glorious, absolutely not the best or easiest career choice, but not the worst. Solid. Achievable. Practical.
     </span>
<span>
      ” Rio explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was then that Rio realized that despite the age gap and the different worlds they were from, they were extremely similar, and it was why they got along so well and why they felt so seen by each other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Tell me you have trauma without telling me you have trauma.” Agatha smiled sarcastically.
     </span>
<span>
      “One more?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, sensing some trick hidden under Agatha’s bikini strap, and she was right. As Rio closed in on her win, Agatha shoved her shoulder, pushed her back, and touched the wall before Rio could.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I win!” Agatha said, grinning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re awful,” Rio said, splashing Agatha in the face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You love it.” She replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I could.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She thought. “What’s the question?” She asked instead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I haven’t thought that far ahead.” Agatha thought for a moment. “Do you, or did you, ever want kids?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why, Agatha Harkness, are you asking me to be your baby daddy?” she asked before breaking out into giggles. Rio Vidal did not giggle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was the sweetest sound Agatha had ever heard, and she vowed to make her do it again as much as she could. She couldn’t help but laugh, which caused her to snort. “No!” She said, “It was an honest question, you brat!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well,” She said after regaining some semblance of composure, “If I were to be with or marry someone with a child or children, then yes. It was always a hard “no” to that question
     </span>
<span>
      growing up, due to my fears of falling in my mother’s footsteps
     </span>
<span>
      . However, it depends on who I’m with and if that happens sooner rather than later. I’m not getting any younger.
     </span>
<span>
      I’m not opposed.
     </span>
<span>
      ”
     </span>
<span>
      There was a time in the not-so-distant past when she thought she would become a stepmother to three blonde teenagers of whom she had been very fond, and possibly have a child. It was not something she wanted to dwell on right now as she pushed the old ache away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wasn't entirely sure why that answer was so important to her, but she had found herself invested in
     </span>
<span>
      Rio’s response
     </span>
<span>
      . She had Nicky, and anyone close to her had to understand that he was number one in her life, even if he was older. She certainly wasn't having any more children,
     </span>
<span>
      though the thought of being with a younger woman, or adopting, hadn’t completely been ruled out for her
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha saw a flash of something across Rio’s face with her answer, but didn’t want to pry.
     </span>
<span>
      Something to unpack during a sleepless night, she thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They climbed out of the pool, went inside to shower, and changed to reconvene with the whole house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The four women had been watching from an overlooking balcony. Wanda couldn’t have done much better if she had been in their minds herself. She knew Agatha and knew she wasn’t going to move faster than Rio was comfortable with.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why won’t they just kiss already!” Jen said, exasperated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you know how long we said that about the two of you?” Nat asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Touché,” Alice said, raising her wine glass.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda pinched the bridge of her nose. “This is painful.” She sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked over at her, knowing it wasn’t just the scene below them that she was referring to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen leaned forward. “Between the football games, the entire month of October, and whatever we need to do after that, they should figure it out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shrugged. “I don’t know. Rio has a damn good reason as to why she doesn’t date parents.” As three sets of eyes looked at her, she shook her head, “Oh no, not my story to tell. That’s all her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda just nodded. “Agatha is many things, but if she really likes Rio, and I can guarantee she does, then she’s not going to do anything to go against that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They spent their last night around the poolside fire pit. Rio and Alice kept throwing out random questions for the boys to help them study. Tommy was trying, desperately.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, can you give me extra points because you’re into my aunt?” He teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes went wide, and her face was one of shock, strictly from the audacity.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The looks on every face varied from shock to trying not to laugh. Agatha was biting back a laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was not amused. “Dude! That’s my mom!” He turned to Rio. “That is my mom, though, so do I just get an automatic A, or…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicholas Scratch Harkness!” Agatha yelled, trying so hard not to laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am not into Agatha!” Rio cried, face bright red.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The blushing says otherwise,” Alice goaded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Aunt Aggie has the hots for you, too,” Billy said, grinning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You are no longer my favorite!” Agatha shouted, her own face turning red.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda owed the boys for this one. She had a shit-eating grin on her face and pointed at Agatha, who rolled her eyes at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision was laughing at the boys. “Now, boys, stop teasing. They’re just friends.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s what Alice and Jen said for years,” Tommy replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice blushed. As Jen looked at Tommy. “Isn’t it past your bedtime, rugrat?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He stuck his tongue out at her. Wanda just nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Actually, boys, it is time for you three to head upstairs. Go.” She directed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They nodded, gave their goodnights, and left, teasing as they went. Vision also made his departure, once again kissing Wanda on the forehead as he left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked pointedly at Rio,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What? Your son needs to study. He’s not getting extra points!” Rio replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It was worth a shot.” Wanda laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The women discussed upcoming football games and gossiped about which parents would be sneaking alcohol into the game, and what kids would be sneaking underneath the bleachers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The night grew late, and everyone departed to their rooms, the beach weekend coming to a close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had changed into her pajamas, having showered after swimming earlier, when she heard her door open and close softly. She let out a breath she didn’t know she was holding as she turned around. She knew it was Agatha and found that she had hoped she would come.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded as Agatha looked at her with the question in her eyes before settling into what was now her side of the bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not a Saturday. So, when we’re in the same place overnight, we share a bed?” Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Like friends,” Agatha stated, nodding.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Absolutely,” Rio replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even in their sleep, the two gravitated towards one another. The large California king mattress was no match for their attraction. ONLY FRIENDS, Rio reiterated to herself. Disentangling herself from Agatha's warm arms, which had wrapped around her in deep sleep. Still, it felt like the most normal thing in the world.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When they headed back the next day, she knew she had grown closer to everyone over the weekend, especially Agatha. She had to pull Jen and Alice apart, reminding them that they would see each other in less than twenty-four hours, and reminded the boys about their quizzes the next day.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      If her friendship with Agatha was this strong after a month, where would it be by the time they went to New York?

       Early September

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio never expected anything from her friends except for the ease of being around them. She never expected to be friends with superstars or get invited to movie premieres, Saturday Night Live, parties, or any of the things she was suddenly preparing to attend next month. It was overwhelming, but she felt like she was just doing things with her friends. Some of those things just happened to be red carpet and star-studded events, no big deal.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before any of that, there was her actual job and the
     </span>
<span>
      events and responsibilities that came with it.
     </span>
<span>
      She had
     </span>
<span>
      administered
     </span>
<span>
      the first quiz of the semester
     </span>
<span>
      the week after Labor Day and their amazing beach weekend.
     </span>
<span>
      While most of her students had
     </span>
<span>
      hit it out of the park
     </span>
<span>
      , a
     </span>
<span>
      select few had not, kicking off after-school tutoring and make-up testing
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
<span>
      Rio’s Thursday tutoring session had just wrapped up, and she was about to leave herself when Lilia Calderu, principal of SHIELD, walked into the large science classroom and closed the door behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Vidal,
     </span>
<span>
      have a seat, I need to speak with you for a moment,” the esteemed principal directed
     </span>
<span>
      as
     </span>
<span>
      she perched on top of a desk like it was the most natural thing in the world for her. “It won’t take long,” she assured, noting the young teacher’s hesitation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “Yes, ma’am. Let me text Alice and tell her it will be a minute.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course.” The older woman waited
     </span>
<span>
      , looking around at the way Rio had set up the classroom, while
     </span>
<span>
      Rio sent off the text and looked back up, meeting her boss’s eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know that you have joined a certain inner circle, and I must remind you that it is imperative to stick to NDAs
     </span>
<span>
      and make certain you guard any secrets that may be shared with you by certain parents
     </span>
<span>
      ,” Lilia said seriously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “Of course.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia regarded her for a moment.
     </span>
<span>
      Lilia read people and she did it well. She wouldn’t be the woman she was or in the positions she was in if she didn’t. She had trusted Alice last spring and could tell that Rio was someone who was honest and genuine. Lilia Calderu also had her sources.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had a sworn duty to protect the people around her, and that included the secrets that those people held.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia’s face softened, having found that Rio was worthy. “You can trust Agatha, you know. It was I that made her bring Nicky here, connected the two of them to this place. Made sure she had the lawyer she had as a child.
     </span>
<span>
      You do not know any of this, by the way,” She paused to make sure the teacher understood what she was conveying. Seeing Rio nod, she continued
     </span>
<span>
      ,  “When you run a specific institution, you know a lot of things about a lot of people. You would do well to remember that.
     </span>
<span>
      ” Lilia stood and looked back at a large planter in the corner of the room. “Pilea Peperomiodes, not an easy plant to grow inside Ms. Vidal. I’ve only known one other person to successfully do so, and yours is quite possibly healthier than hers. That’s quite the green thumb.” She turned back to her.
     </span>
<span>
      “Oh! And, parents like you so far, keep it up! Looking forward to the game tomorrow! Go Superstars!” She finished and left before Rio could reply, leaving the door open as Alice walked in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You ready to go?” Alice asked. “I knew Lilia wouldn’t stay very long.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I never know what the fuck Lilia means. It takes me a good two business weeks to figure it out.” Rio
     </span>
<span>
      continued to stare
     </span>
<span>
      out the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice nodded. “It’s been a decade and I’m still learning.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tilted her head as she slung her backpack over her shoulder, “You’ve been here for a while and know everyone well, was Lilia the reason Agatha brought Nicky here?” Rio asked as she turned off the lights and they walked out of the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice made sure she chose her words carefully. She wasn’t prepared to share everything with Rio yet. It wasn’t lying, really. She was just telling her half-truths. “Lilia was one of Agatha’s tutors when she was young, and so when Nicky was old enough to go to school, she found out Lilia was the principal, and she trusted Lilia, so yeah.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Okay, that’s close to the truth.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Alice thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they drove home, Rio couldn’t help but think about how normal everything felt so far. Football games, her best friend dating
     </span>
<span>
      someone that seemed perfect for her
     </span>
<span>
      , concerned parents, parents, and teachers still volunteering to help out at the concession stand. So there were bodyguards and heightened security everywhere, state-of-the-art facilities, a sniper’s nest at a high school football game…it wasn’t completely normal, but it was done in a way that it was very concealed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Other than the football game, what are your plans for the weekend?” Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Jen and I are going out Saturday night,”
     </span>
<span>
      they were actually having dinner with Lilia, but Rio didn’t need to know that. “
     </span>
<span>
      So we’ll miss movie night, nothing Sunday, you?” Alice looked over at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Movie night Saturday, and it looks like everyone except you and I are headed out Sunday for promo events in New York for a few days, then they’ll be back here.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shrugged. “Get used to a lot of texting.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t know what you mean. Just a normal amount of texting a friend of mine is all,” Rio shrugged back,
     </span>
<span>
      slightly mockingly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice rolled her eyes. “We’ve taken bets on how long it takes. Do you want in?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sure, put me down for fuck you guys.” Rio groaned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s only a matter of time. You’ve already shared a bed.” Alice grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was spilling my very complicated feelings to you and you’re using that against me right now! I am hurt!” Rio joked, knowing that Alice didn’t mean any true harm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am your sister from an unknown mister, and it is my duty.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After her usual bedtime routine, switching her playlist, and getting comfortable with Raven purring next to her, Rio grabbed her phone to text Agatha, as had also become routine.

      Agatha was holding on to the fact that she didn’t date Nicky’s teachers,
     </span>
<span>
      or anyone, for that matter. She had her heart utterly annihilated once and would not go down that road again.
     </span>
<span>
      She also didn’t want to lose Rio’s friendship if things went poorly. Lines were being blurred, but they could handle that like the grown adults they were.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      If the last time Rio had dated a parent had ended terribly, this was bound to end even worse, and that was definitely not an option.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The only way this could end worse
      </span>

<span>
      , she thought to herself,
     </span>
<em>

      </span>

<span>
      Okay, so not worse, but losing Agatha’s friendship would break her in a much different way.

      Agatha found herself almost adding kissing emojis like a teenage girl. She groaned. This was not normal for her. Agatha Harkness did not pine. She did not yearn. Women came to her. Women threw themselves at her. What was happening? She was fifty-one years old, damnit, not fifteen. She screamed into her pillow before rolling over and trying to go to sleep, only to dream of Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Of course, a school for the children of Hollywood stars would have ‘superstars’ as its mascot. Rio had rolled her eyes when she had first heard it and still thought it was too on the nose even now. She thought cougars would have been appropriate and funny, but she hadn’t been in charge of choosing the mascot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked around the gym as students gathered for the pep rally.
     </span>
<span>
      As she mentally went over the students’ names, she was reminded that it
     </span>
<span>
      wasn’t just the Hollywood elite that sent their children to SHIELD, it was athletes, CEOs, billionaires, tech bros, politicians, and people up in that range.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stood with the other teachers and cheered as the football players came out, cheering for Nicky. She waved to Billy in the stands and cheered for other students. Rio had always enjoyed supporting students
     </span>
<span>
      for all activities, not just sports.
     </span>
<span>
      Football days were also fun days for most or make-up days for students to bring up grades. She enjoyed it, and the chance to get to know her students better.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By the time the last bell rang, she was anxious for the football game. She didn’t care if they won or not. She was just ready to see a certain megastar. She told herself it was because they had gotten so close, and she would be excited to see Alice and the others as well. She was lying to herself, but
     </span>
<span>
      it made her feel more like an adult and less like one of her students with a fleeting crush of the week.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even if there was nothing fleeting about this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By the time she got to the concession stand to report for her shift, she was vibrating with excitement. She knew they were also working with several other parents, including Carol Danvers. She and her wife, Maria, had a daughter Nicky’s age who was in Rio’s advanced class. Carol was another award-winning actress, and Maria was a literal rocket scientist.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio walked into the building to see Agatha setting up with other parents and teachers. Agatha smiled when she saw her, excusing herself and making her way to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey! You’ve got popcorn, I’ve got candy.” She said as she hugged Rio
     </span>
<span>
      in greeting
     </span>
<span>
      , a hug that was over too quickly for Rio’s liking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was slightly surprised by the friendly greeting in such a public place, cut considering people were taking bets on them getting together, and they had shared a bed, she’d take it.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They just happen to be right next to each other,” Danvers said as she walked over to the hot dogs
     </span>
<span>
      with a smirk
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re on hot dog duty?” Rio asked innocently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, which works for me.” Danvers shrugged with a wink.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned over and whispered, “Today’s was Danvers’ pick in the betting pool, and thought I’d like to be next to you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stifled a laugh, remembering their ocean battle from last weekend and the bet they had made.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicky going to lead us to state this year, Agatha?” Another parent asked, interrupting their conspiring.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched as Agatha turned into Agatha Harkness, football mom, superstar, and America’s Sweetheart. “Hopefully! As long as your son can protect him long enough.” There was laughter before someone opened the windows to the stand, and their work began.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Shifts were only a quarter, and thankfully, the time went by quickly.
     </span>
<span>
      Working in such a
     </span>
<span>
      confined
     </span>
<span>
      space,
     </span>
<span>
      Rio and Agatha
     </span>
<span>
      had bumped into each other constantly, mostly by accident, but neither woman minded. When their time was up, the
     </span>
<span>
      next shift took over,
     </span>
<span>
      and as they left the building, Agatha grabbed Rio by the arm and led her away before she could get caught up in any conversations with parents who wanted to know how their student was doing in her class.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey!
     </span>
<span>
      Mrs. Chavez needs to speak with me
     </span>
<span>
      .”
     </span>
<span>
      Rio laughed as Agatha pulled her away
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head. “
     </span>
<span>
      I can assure you that she is not interested in the science you teach, and we have a game to catch and a quarterback to cheer for.
     </span>
<span>

</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<span>
      Oh, right! Nicky. I haven’t seen him play yet.
     </span>
<span>
      ”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They reached their group in the stands. Tommy was on the junior varsity team and wasn’t playing
     </span>
<span>
      as their game had been the previous night. He was still paying very close attention to the plays and all the action on the field below.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<span>
      How’s he doing
     </span>
<span>
      ?” Agatha asked as they
     </span>
<span>
      scooted into the bleachers
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “One
     </span>
<span>
      passing
     </span>
<span>
      touchdown so far,
     </span>
<span>
      and twenty yards from
     </span>
<span>
      second. Tied game. Defenses are doing well
     </span>
<span>
      and stopping everything on both sides
     </span>
<span>
      .” Tommy
     </span>
<span>
      rattled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked out at the field where Nicky was lining up. They were at the 20-yard line
     </span>
<span>
      a pass he should easily be able to convert for a touchdown
     </span>
<span>
      . He saw
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha
     </span>
<span>
      right before the snap, and that was the good luck he needed.
     </span>
<span>
      Nicky couldn’t find an open receiver, scrambled, and ran it in for a touchdown
     </span>
<span>
      . The stands erupted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      His ability to think quickly on his feet was what had secured him the starting quarterback position the previous year.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The game had been close
     </span>
<span>
      , and the Superstars barely won 28-27.
     </span>
<span>
      Nicky, a perfectionist like his mother, knew he needed to improve and discussed strategies with Vision and Tommy after the game.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know there are a lot of great high schools around here, Nicky, but have you thought of watching tapes from schools in other great football states? To get plays and tips from those?” Rio asked as they all walked to the parking lot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He shook his head, droplets of water from his quick shower flying off. “No. I hadn’t thought about that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled at him. “I’ll text Rogers and give him some names of schools. I have a friend who coached basketball, and she did that, helped the team a lot.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thanks Rio! So you like football?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Nicky continued their conversation back to the vehicles and at their after-game victory dinner. A tradition Agatha had started with Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda leaned over and whispered into Agatha’s ear. “They’re already bonding.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. “Yes, like you do with your friend’s kids.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s a little more…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shut up and eat your fries before I steal them.”
     </span>

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      September continued, filled with football games for two out of the three boys, and Billy started rehearsals for the fall musical. The coven continued with their movie nights, and everyone had work, whether it was celebrity or teaching-related.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Agatha continued to build a closer rapport, Alice and Jen were disgustingly adorable, and something was happening in the Maximoff household.
     </span>
<span>
      Wanda was growing more and more restless, and it was affecting Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the month crawled along Agatha started table reads for her new TV show, as well as costume fittings, and promotional events were picking up for both stars. It was a Thursday evening later in the month as Wanda sat in the living room helping Billy run lines for his role in the fall musical. They were doing Beetlejuice, and he was the lead. Vision was on the floor at the coffee table, helping Tommy with his math. Tommy was failing and hadn’t been able to play in the junior varsity game that night. Coach Rogers wouldn’t even let him sit on the bench until he passed, and he was surly about it, but trying his hardest to truly understand the material. Nicky was listening to music on the opposite couch, typing a history essay for Alice’s class. He was staying over while Agatha was in New York for a few days. Wanda smiled as she surveyed the scene of happiness before her, then looked over at Nat, the beautiful redhead she had… until reality hit her, as it always did. Nat’s face quickly dissipated into Vision’s, her husband. The man that she had married when she was twenty-six and had been married to for almost twenty years, and would be with for so much longer…
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mom? Mom?” Billy’s voice cut through her thoughts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She startled and looked at him, “Oh, sweetie, I’m sorry. I just thought of something. Give me a quick minute.” She got up, grabbed her phone, and tried to walk as normally as possible to her bedroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, Wanda, hold it together.” She whispered to herself, voice shaking. She did her breathing exercises to calm herself down so she could get through her mom and wife duties for another hour.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Think.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha and Nat were in New York, so that was out. She couldn’t talk to Jen, who would just go into PR mode instead of friend mode, which also ruled out Alice since they were attached at the hip. Wanda opened her texts without thinking. If Agatha trusted Rio, she could too,
     </span>
<span>
      remembering Rio’s offer from Labor Day weekend.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

      Me:

<p>
<span>
      I know it’s a school night, but it’s an

<p>
<span>
      emergency. Can I come over in about
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      an hour and a half?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She sent the text and then realized how the ‘emergency’ part might be taken.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Me:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It’s not about Agatha.

      Shit.

</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda smiled before blowing out a breath. She just needed to get through the evening, and then she’d drive over to Rio’s and just let everything out. She knew she could trust Ri,o and she had a feeling that the younger woman,
     </span>
<span>
      like so many of the women that surrounded her,
     </span>
<span>
      was wise beyond her years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She
     </span>
<span>
      returned
     </span>
<span>
      to the living room, resuming her position next to Billy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision looked up at her with a questioning look. “Is everything okay, darling?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, though, is it okay if I head to Rio’s in a bit? She’s having a bit of an emergency.” She replied in her best concerned friend voice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy raised an eyebrow as Tommy smirked. Nicky, thankfully, couldn’t hear due to his headphones.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision ignored his sons,
     </span>
<span>
      seeing through his wife’s white lie.
     </span>
<span>
      “Of course, dear. I can take over running lines with Billy if you want to leave now,” he offered.
     </span>
<span>
      Vision had noticed changes in Wanda’s behavior over the last few months. It put him on edge. He didn’t know what could be brewing next.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy’s head popped up as he gave his mom a pleading look. His dad was not good at acting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda just smiled. “No, it can wait. Boys first.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This was one of the reasons she had fallen in love with Vision, and she really had loved him. She still did, but it wasn’t a romantic love anymore
     </span>
<span>
      if it ever had been in the first place
     </span>
<span>
      . He was sweet and selfless, always putting his family first. He hadn’t had to think before offering to take over for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Forty-five minutes later, homework was finished. Wanda gave Vision a quick peck on the cheek goodbye, said goodnight to the boys, grabbed two bottles of wine, and headed to Rio’s. She was going to drive herself, but Vision had insisted on having someone drive her since she had planned on drinking. Not her having a caring and thoughtful husband while she weighed her options of leaving him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had been on edge since she got the text from Wanda. What could possibly be going on that she was coming to her for? She could only think of one topic that Wanda would come to her for right now, and not Jen or Alice, and that was a certain Russian. Agatha’s ‘wait for her to come to you’ when she had asked had apparently been more prophetic than anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Knowing they’d be up late, she was already in PJs and mostly ready for bed, her work bag ready for tomorrow and next to the door. She had chilled wine glasses and random snacks out, an appropriate playlist on, and a fresh box of tissues ready to go. She was ready to be a supportive friend.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took a deep breath as she stood in front of Rio’s door. She had been here before, normally one door down at Alice’s, and now about to share parts of the last twenty-seven years of her life, of which only
     </span>
<span>
      a few
     </span>
<span>
      other people knew every part. She clutched the tote bag that held the wine bottles and knocked, knowing that if Agatha was going to eventually be with Rio, then Wanda had to tell her at some point. Might as well be now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio opened the door and let Wanda in. She closed the door and had barely turned around when Wanda broke into a sob and melted against her. Rio suspected it was bad if that’s all it took. She wrapped her arms around Wanda, and they stood there for a moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, it’s okay. We’re going to talk through it. You don’t have to keep it in, you can talk to me, okay?” She soothed. She knew how it felt to have your
     </span>
<strike>
<span>
       best friend
      </span>
</strike>
<span>
      sister in another city and no one to talk to. It’s how she had felt for the past few years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Wanda’s initial sobs died away, she stepped back, wiping her eyes. “I’m sorry, I’ve just been holding that back for longer than I thought,” she said with a watery laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes were soft as she gave a small smile. “It’s fine, I’ve got Kleenex and everything ready to go, come on. Tell me everything.” She gestured to the living room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They settled in on the couch, turning to face each other. Rio opened the wine and poured them both a full glass. She felt they were going to go through both bottles rather quickly. Raven had already found a home on Wanda’s lap, for which Wanda looked grateful. She needed to do something with both hands. Petting a cat with one hand and holding a wine glass in the other worked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took a sip of her wine and looked at Rio, trying to decipher how to start the conversation, and she wasn’t sure how. She looked at Rio with big green eyes, “I don't know where to start…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked back at Wanda, raising an eyebrow. “Wherever you feel comfortable. Agatha hasn’t told me
     </span>
<span>
      much of anything, really.
     </span>
<span>
      She would never betray your trust, so everything I’m about to say is what I have picked up over the past nearly two months.”
     </span>
<span>
      Rio
     </span>
<span>
      took a sip of her wine as Wanda nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What I know is that you and Nat met when you were both 18. She was hired to kill Agatha, and from what I saw when Nat told me that story, she was not planning on you being there, or just you in general. Agatha struck a deal with her, and she joined the merry band of misfits. You married Vision, I assume, because you decided
     </span>
<span>
      it was easier to fit into the mold created for you
     </span>
<span>
      , and now you’re realizing that it wasn’t necessarily a mistake, but it’s not the life you wanted
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You and Nat are obviously in love, and you both have been doing a terrible job at hiding it around us,
     </span>
<span>
      or at all,
     </span>
<span>
      lately. I don’t know how deep it goes, I don’t know the whole backstory, but that’s what I’ve gathered.” Rio finished her summary, watching for Wanda’s reaction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda sighed heavily, finishing her wine and pouring another. “You aren’t wrong. That’s an oversimplification, but you aren’t wrong.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched Wanda pour her second glass and realized just how much of a toll this had taken. Yes, Wanda drank, they all did, but usually not this quickly.
     </span>
<span>
      “You can share as much or as little as you want. There is no judgment here, Wanda. I am here for support, and insight if you want it, friendship, and the occasional snide remark.” She said sincerely. These women meant so much to Rio, and she truly wanted to be someone they could come to about anything and everything. She also wanted every single one of them to be happy and live their best life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was quiet for a moment, still trying to decide where to begin, before taking a deep breath and letting it out. “Nat once told me that she saw me and knew she couldn’t kill someone that immediately took her breath away, and that’s the only reason we got the upper hand.” She laughed. “How’s that for a line?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Man, oldest line in the assassin handbook, I’m sure,” Rio interjected, refilling her now-empty glass.
     </span>
<span>
      She silently reminded herself that she had to work tomorrow and needed to slow down. She did not have to keep up with the Eastern European who could probably drink two bottles of wine and act out one of her earlier movies from memory.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda laughed, “I was eighteen and Agatha was...twenty-four? When Nat tried to murder her that night. Good thing I looked cute. Agatha wanted to keep it out of the media, so she pulled some legal strings and found out who had sent Nat.” Wanda stopped, waiting for Rio to put a few pieces together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned her head slightly. “What year was that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ninety-Seven.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio remembered dates and years, especially major headlines, even if she had only been eight that year. Her eyes widened. “Isn’t that the year Agatha’s mom died in prison?” She asked cautiously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shrugged. “The Russians really hate it when you promise them something you can’t give them, and they lose one of their best assassins. They also love legal favors.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knocked back her wine and poured them a third glass, emptying the bottle. “Fuck,
     </span>
<span>
      that’s information I didn’t need
     </span>
<span>
      . I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s what I do,
     </span>
<span>
      with a lot of things
     </span>
<span>
      .” Wanda continued. “Anyway, we were our little trio, Agatha
     </span>
<span>
      sleeping with
     </span>
<span>
      every woman with a pulse. I was, somewhat interested in guys, but not very. I had my relationships, all PR.
     </span>
<span>
      I was not out, and I didn’t even know I was gay. I was an absolute mess for two years, though. I had very conflicting feelings for Nat. She was my best friend, but more than that, and Nat? She dated other women during those two years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<span>
      One night in 1999,
     </span>
<span>
      I found myself asking Agatha Harkness,
     </span>
<span>
      this
     </span>
<span>
      lesbian icon and bad boy, how to know if I was into women and, subsequently, if they were into me. That
     </span>
<span>
      lovable
     </span>
<span>
      bitch straight-up laughed at me. I was twenty,
     </span>
<span>
      still so innocent,
     </span>
<span>
      and extremely vulnerable, and the bitch laughed at me.” Wanda laughed at the memory.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio could imagine a young Agatha, fully knowing what baby gay Wanda was asking, laughing in her face. “Sounds like Agatha. Did she tell you to ‘Just go kiss her, Maximoff’.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She didn’t say kiss, but yes!” Wanda exclaimed brightly, her native accent was starting to bleed through because of the alcohol. “You know her so well. Anyway, so I did. I went
     </span>
<span>
      directly to her room. We
     </span>
<span>
      were all living together
     </span>
<span>
      in the original house up on the hill. Her bedroom was right next to mine,
     </span>
<span>
      and much like you and Agatha, we had already been lying to ourselves.” Wanda gave Rio a knowing look while Rio downed her wine,
     </span>
<span>
      throwing caution to the wind,
     </span>
<span>
      and
     </span>
<span>
      uncorked the second
     </span>
<span>
      bottle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow in question to Wanda, and she nodded, a silent agreement to ditch the glasses.
     </span>
<span>
      Tomorrow was Friday, she could teach with a hangover if she had to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda continued with the story.
     </span>
<span>
      “I crawled into bed with her, something I had done hundreds of times before. It wasn’t unusual for us to cuddle,
     </span>
<span>
      finding comfort in each other.
     </span>
<span>
      She gave Rio another pointed
     </span>
<span>
      look,
     </span>
<span>
      causing Rio to roll her eyes, huff, and take a drink from the bottle
     </span>
<span>
      . “And I cupped her face and kissed her.” Wanda finished her glass and set it down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What happened next?” Rio breathed, handing Wanda the bottle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took a drink before responding. “She kissed me back, and then I cried. I was so afraid to come out. I wasn’t as established as Agatha, I was already seen as this wholesome girl-next-door, date-the-boy type of star. I didn’t know what to do. We agreed to just keep it a secret and see what happened.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You were already in love,” Rio stated, trying to remain serious, though her words were beginning to slur.
     </span>
<span>
      How strong was this wine?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded as a tear fell down her cheek. She wiped it away and continued. “We kept it hidden for years, Agatha kept telling me there was room in the world for more than one lesbian superstar, but I wouldn’t listen. I wanted kids, I wanted to live an open life, and so did Natasha. Anytime I brought up coming out, our PR shut it down. That was way before Jen. There were so many arguments and fights. We were madly in love, but I couldn’t hurt my career. It was all I had
     </span>
<span>
      , or so I thought
     </span>
<span>
      . I kept having
     </span>
<span>
      these bearded and PR relationships, though I didn’t need them. They really were just to keep the rumors at bay.
     </span>
<span>
      They were all with
     </span>
<span>
      famous men who had gay rumors. After the last one, I had decided I was done, I couldn’t do it anymore.” She took the bottle back from Rio, accent
     </span>
<span>
      coming out even more
     </span>
<span>
      . “We
     </span>
<span>
      might
     </span>
<span>
      need more alcohol. Shit’s about to get fucking shittastic.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “On it. Eat a snack.” Rio gestured towards the table in front of them as she gathered the
     </span>
<span>
      empty bottles and glasses, left the half bottle,
     </span>
<span>
      and went to the kitchen. “How old were you at this point?” Rio called, words slurring, as she looked in the refrigerator, chose
     </span>
<span>
      two ciders, and fixed two large tumblers of ice water with electrolyte packets
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Twenty-free, I mean, three.” She called back, giggling at her misspeak, opened a bag of popcorn, and grabbed a handful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed while she opened the wine and came back to the couch, resuming her position. She had done the math and looked at Wanda, understanding why she had been sent to get more
     </span>
<span>
      alcohol even though they had half a bottle left
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You met Vision and things got complicated.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded as she took another drink. “I met Vision. He was consulting on a movie, and for the first time, I actually felt something deep for a man,
     </span>
<span>
      or so I thought
     </span>
<span>
      . Color me startled.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What color is startled?” Rio took the bottle back and a handful of popcorn herself. She was completely captured by Wanda’s story and was understanding everyone even more with every word.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Scarlet, I think.” Wanda resituated her legs before continuing. “Nat and I had kept things so under wraps, Vis had no idea I liked women. He was so sweet and caring. Leave it to me to fall for the two most amazing, understanding, selfless people in the world at the same damn time.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What did you tell Aga…Nat?”
     </span>
<span>
      Rio’s
     </span>
<span>
      sapphics were running together with her increased blood alcohol content.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t have to. She came to me. She wasn’t mad, she wasn’t jealous. She just took me in her arms and asked me what I wanted. I was falling in love with someone else,
     </span>
<span>
      again, or so I thought at the time,
     </span>
<span>
      and the woman I also loved, who was madly in love with me, asked me what I wanted. She asked me what would make me happy. I was twenty-four, I didn’t know, and I told her that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I told her that I was in love with both of them, but that wasn’t fair to either of them. That beautiful woman looked at me and said that she would always be with me, even if it wasn’t the way that she wanted to be. That she would always be mine, even if I wasn’t completely hers. My heart shattered that night.” Wanda grabbed another tissue,
     </span>
<span>
      a pile of them already
     </span>
<span>
      in her lap. Raven had jumped down when she had shifted positions earlier.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What did Vision say?” Rio asked, a tissue in her hand as well.
     </span>
<span>
      The second bottle was now gone, and they had moved on to their ciders, an unspoken agreement that they were done after that.
     </span>
<span>
      They were slurring words,
     </span>
<span>
      and Rio
     </span>
<span>
      was proud she could understand Wanda through
     </span>
<span>
      her now
     </span>
<span>
      heavy accent, and tears were flowing
     </span>
<span>
      from both.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That he understood. Can you believe
     </span>
<span>
      that asshole
     </span>
<span>
      ? So I went to Agatha. She knew everything,
     </span>
<span>
      of course
     </span>
<span>
      , she had been the support for Nat and me both, but never caught in the middle. She, of course, had her own brand of dry humor, and we listened to a lot of Melissa Etheridge and Indigo Girls. She told me that I had to do what I felt was right for me and what I could live with. I had to decide if I could live with potentially losing my fans. She had built her career on being gay. I hadn’t. However, fuck the people I lost because my happiness was worth everything.” Wanda’s eyes were watery.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew what happened next. She remembered the grainy pictures. She and Alice had been teenagers and were shocked when they saw the headlines in their favorite tabloids of the time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then the pictures broke,” Rio said softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was twenty-four? Twenty-five? Vis and I were officially dating. Nat remained on security, of course, when that grainy picture of Nat and I making out at a concert was splashed everywhere.” Wanda sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Your engagement was announced soon after,” Rio whispered, remembering.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. “PR’s idea. Vis said we could call the whole idea off. He wasn’t even mad.
     </span>
<span>
      Nat and I were still dating, we just kept it a secret like we had been.
     </span>
<span>
      It was a moment of weakness, we were at The Killers concert and got caught up in the moment.
     </span>
<span>
      Nat and I always do at concerts, music is important to us.
     </span>
<span>
      However, studios had already started calling
     </span>
<span>
      with questions, worried about their bottom line and how this would affect it and current projects.
     </span>
<span>
      It was a nightmare. I had to make a statement that it wasn’t a kiss, it was an entire thing. Anyway, we were married in
     </span>
<span>
      early
     </span>
<span>
      2005,
     </span>
<span>
      shortly after I turned twenty-six
     </span>
<span>
      .” Wanda blew her nose and placed the empty popcorn bag on the table.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How did Nat take it?” Rio couldn’t imagine watching the person she was in love with marry someone else.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hard. She understood, but she hated it. She stayed by my side though, always mine, never hers.” Wanda swallowed a sob. “So we went through the first few years. I really
     </span>
<span>
      thought I
     </span>
<span>
      was in love with Vision then. My star rose, I won awards, and the public forgot about my ‘lesbian scare’. Agatha had Nicky, and Vis could tell I was less than happy. So we started trying for a baby and had the twins. I remember wishing that they had been Nat’s
     </span>
<span>
      , though she had been there for everything
     </span>
<span>
      . She would have been such a great mother.”
     </span>
<span>
      Wanda knew that Nat couldn’t have children, not something she would be telling Rio. The closest Nat would come to having kids was the boys, but Wanda so badly wished at that moment that it had been different
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “As it was, Vis knew
     </span>
<span>
      the role Nat played
     </span>
<span>
      . He always knew, it’s like they had some unspoken agreement. I had three people doting on me while I was pregnant.
     </span>
<span>
      As I’m sure you can guess, Agatha was the third
     </span>
<span>
      .” Wanda
     </span>
<span>
      smiled
     </span>
<span>
      at the memories, a small mountain of crumbled tissues in her lap.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Natasha Romanov is a great father, I mean mother,” Rio told her. “Those boys have three moms and a dad, and they,
     </span>
<span>
      and all adults,
     </span>
<span>
      know it. She would move planets for those boys, you, and even for Vision if she thought it would make you happy.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda gave a watery smile. “You’re right, and she has. She
     </span>
<span>
      also
     </span>
<span>
      refuses to date
     </span>
<span>
      anyone else
     </span>
<span>
      , no matter how much I tell her to.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You would hate it if she did.” They were well past drinking now, trying to sober up a little, still slurring words here and there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. “It would kill me. Just as I know it kills her to see me
     </span>
<span>
      live the life we dreamed of, but with someone else
     </span>
<span>
      .” She took another breath. “Around the time the boys turned one, and I’d been married for six years,
     </span>
<span>
      I started to get restless
     </span>
<span>
      .” Wanda saw the look on Rio’s face. “I know, it’s been thirteen years since then, yes. Vis knows
     </span>
<span>
      how I feel
     </span>
<span>
      , but he’s never said anything. He gives me my girl time
     </span>
<span>
      and my Nat time
     </span>
<span>
      . He’s an amazing husband and father.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<span>
      We have an agreement. Kisses, chaste touches. I think Vis would be okay if Nat and I were fully together, but that’s not fair to him, and I can’t be dishonest. I can’t break our vows. They mean something to me. I also can’t risk that leaking. I’m walking a tight line as it is.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He deserves to be happy. I’m just so afraid of hurting the boys, and at this point, I’ve sacrificed so much for this life, for my career. I hurt two people that I love, albeit in different ways, and I don’t want to do it again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t want to hurt him, and at the same time, I’m not in love with him anymore,
     </span>
<span>
      if I ever really was
     </span>
<span>
      . I am still madly in love with her, just as much as I was when we were 20. I’ve been in love with her for 25 years, Rio, and all I have to show for that is a few years where we were truly together, and decades of stolen moments. I want her. I want her to be the one doing homework time with me, her to be the one helping me in the kitchen, walking red carpets, and hugging me when I win awards. I want to stand up at that podium holding an Oscar and say ‘thank you to my wife for always believing in me’, not just knowing I mean her when I mention my friends and family.” Wanda’s tears were flowing freely again, as were Rio’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I also feel like I stole twenty years of their lives, Rio. That’s twenty years neither of them can get back.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned forward and hugged her, Wanda hugging her back, burying her face into Rio’s shoulder. They stayed that way for a few minutes before Rio drew back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda wiped her face and looked at Rio through bloodshot eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What if it’s too late?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at her with disbelief. “Have you seen the way she looks at you? Nat is as madly in love with you as you are with her. The decision you have to make is, are you willing to do this?
     </span>
<span>
      I mean, really do this.
     </span>
<span>
      Live your truth? There’s no keeping this secret. Not with two teenage boys and as famous as you are, social media, everything. You obviously have to talk with your husband, but Wanda. You’ve been living your own personal ‘Good Luck, Babe’ your entire adult life. You deserve good things, and you deserve happiness. How do you expect to set that example for your boys if you don’t do it for yourself? Billy is gay if you haven’t noticed. How do you think he’d react if you kept this hidden for another 30 years? A good half of the public already thinks you're fucking Agatha, there’s a subsection that already ships you and Nat. All of THAT aside, you have to live for YOU, Wanda. We can all see that you’re driving yourself insane.
     </span>
<span>
      You’ve been spiraling the entire time I’ve known you, and you two aren’t subtle.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You have not stolen time from either of them. Vision will always support you, and Natasha? Wanda, honey, the moment you are able to, we aren’t going to hear from either of you for at least a week. She only has eyes for you.
     </span>
<span>
      Talk to your husband, get your woman. As you said, she will always be yours, go be hers.” Rio finished and handed Wanda a new Kleenex.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked at the pile of tissues in her lap. “You’re right, you know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I usually am.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “When will you follow your own advice and go after your happiness?” Wanda asked, not completely innocently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’re not here about me right now. I have my own tragic story, but tonight isn’t that night.” Rio said, putting a hand on Wanda’s knee and squeezing. Wanda
     </span>
<span>
      returned a slight nod
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have some things to do as it is. Like, get home and talk to my husband
     </span>
<span>
      for starters
     </span>
<span>
      .”
     </span>
<span>
      Wanda exhaled a shaky breath and texted her driver.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave Wanda a long hug goodbye and wished her luck, telling her to update her as soon as she had one. Wanda promised she would and thanked her before
     </span>
<span>
      walking to the car, only stumbling twice.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio cleaned up, turning off lights throughout the apartment as she stumbled to her room herself. Once she had finished the bedtime routine and gotten situated, making sure to take Tylenol to head off any ill effects in the morning, she realized it was 2 am in New York, and she hadn’t texted Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tonight with Wanda had been an eye-opener. She knew that something was going on between the two redheads, but a 25-year-long affair of sorts? That she hadn’t expected. She thought about her feelings towards Agatha. Was she living her truth? Was she being honest with herself?
     </span>

<span>
       No. You want to kiss that woman. You have dreamt of that woman. You have had impure thoughts of that woman. You want to throw

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was believable. She had promised Wanda she wouldn’t tell Agatha about tonight until Wanda was ready for her to know. Rio and Wanda were even closer now, and considering how much Wanda meant to Agatha, Rio would keep her promises. This family Rio had been
     </span>
<span>
      welcomed into
     </span>
<span>
      meant everything to her.
     </span>

<span>
       buzzed

</p>
<p>

<p>
<span>
      If Agatha said it first, then she could say it back, and they were absolutely close enough that it was time to use her nickname. This was a start.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha ran into Nat’s room
     </span>
<span>
      at the Manhattan apartment that she and Wanda owned, jumping
     </span>
<span>
      on her bed
     </span>
<span>
      as though the numbers in her age had magically flipped around
     </span>
<span>
      . Agatha shoved her phone into
     </span>
<span>
      Nat’s
     </span>
<span>
      face
     </span>
<span>
      as if the cute girl
     </span>
<span>
      had just checked yes on the ‘Do you like me?’ note.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After all, she had, hadn’t she?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She said she missed me too and called me Aggie!” Agatha said uncharacteristically. She was well past buzzed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You don’t date teachers,
     </span>
<span>
      or at all
     </span>
<span>
      ,” Nat mocked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, I’m just excited to be missed,” Agatha stated, regaining her composure.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat grinned as her phone dinged, and she picked it up to check
     </span>
<span>
      what was most likely her nightly text from Wanda. She covered her mouth with her hand, and the tears formed
     </span>
<span>
      automatically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Natasha Romanov did not create tears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What happened? What’s wrong?” Agatha asked automatically, worried someone had died.
     </span>
</p>

      When Wanda returned home that night, Vision had been waiting for her in their bedroom, reading a book, knowing what was coming. He had anticipated this moment for the past twenty years of their lives and had noticed Wanda’s increasing distance, her frequent absences if the boys weren’t around, and the increased girl time. He gave her the space and time she needed. He would always love her, but he also knew what this had been and he had been grateful for it, but if she hadn’t come forward soon, he was going to. He deserved true happiness as much as she did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There had been tears and conversation, but absolutely zero hard feelings on his side. They agreed to wait until after the holidays to tell the boys, and Wanda needed to talk to Jen about how they would approach the media. They would work out co-parenting and divorce details later. Neither planned on being nasty about it and they had been more like roommates than anything for a long time. Vision had joked about giving Nat the same shovel talk she had given him once, except she actually could make him disappear without a trace. Wanda had just smiled. She had sent that text to Nat before talking to Vision, knowing Nat wouldn’t respond. Nat would want to have that conversation in person. She also knew what Agatha would do.

      Nat had barely made it into Agatha’s house before Wanda had jumped in her arms, legs around her waist. She hugged her before kissing her deeply, sliding her hand to cup Nat’s jaw. Nat lowered Wanda slowly to her feet, careful not to break the kiss, running her tongue across her bottom lip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha cleared her throat, causing the two women to break their kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked into Wanda’s eyes. “Yes, you can be mine.” She answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda just nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha clapped her hands together, walking past them. “Great, now that that’s cleared up. Jen will be here in an hour, football game this evening, and kid?” She turned to Wanda, “I am so proud of you.” She winked before ascending the stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “WHAT?!” Jen exclaimed out of excitement, surprise, and confusion. There were a lot of emotions, and she said as much. “Wanda, I am so glad you are finally clearing up your decades-long situationship, I am. But right now? Right before awards season? You just signed with Marvel!” Jen wasn’t sure how she was going to spin this, package it, anything. Wanda and Vision had been one of Hollywood’s very few long-lasting couples.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Jen. Look, Wanda coming out of the closet will not surprise many. Marvel is going the way of queer anyway, so is Disney. We spin it positively. I’m gay and not at all monogamous, and they signed me. Everything will be fine. Our new movie? Wanda and I literally play lovers and have very convincing sex in it. Calm your tits Kale, or let Alice do it for you.” She smirked, eliciting a blush and an eye-roll. “Besides, America’s Stepford Couple will not announce it to the kids, let alone the rest of the world, until after the holidays. Nat and Wanda will just be more open and cuddly around us, but still play it cool everywhere else. Don’t expect them to go gaying it up everywhere else yet, okay? That’s my job.” Agatha explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked a lot calmer. “Okay, that makes me feel…oddly better.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The couple in question was sitting together looking like two teenagers who had just told their parents that the condom had failed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at them both. “I am very happy for both of you. Truly.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda beamed. “Me too.” She turned to Nat and kissed her cheek. “Are you okay with this?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat turned and looked at her. “I finally get you, Wanda -body, soul, home, and publically? Yes. I’m okay with it.” She gave her a chaste kiss as Agatha groaned again, smiling this time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Now there’s two lovesick couples? Gross.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen waved her hands out in front of her. “No one said anything about love. Alice and I are taking it slow. It’s a very strong like.” She denied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Debatable,” Wanda teased. “To be fair, I’ve loved Nat for 25 years.” Nat just nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, but now you guys will be all open about it.” Agatha grimaced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Right, and you and Rio don’t look at each other like middle schoolers discovering their first crush,” Nat said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was proud of Wanda for finally coming to this decision. She knew it was one Wanda would make eventually, but was surprised Wanda hadn’t talked to her about it first. She had been just as shocked as Nat was when she received that text last night. She would either ask Wanda about it or Wanda would come to her, however, she suspected Wanda had talked to a certain brunette, and that made her heart soar that her sister was confiding in her new…close friend.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Friend.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We need to make sure that your girlfriends are on the same page,” Wanda said, seeing if Agatha caught what she said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll text Alice now,” Jen said, side-eyeing Agatha, waiting for the response.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll text Ri,” Agatha said automatically. Her eyes suddenly went wide as it hit her. “SHE IS NOT MY GIRLFRIEND!” She yelled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat fell into Wanda’s lap from laughing so hard.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Only ALICE calls her RI!” Wanda shouted back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen texted every word to Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Across town, Alice broke out into laughter while half her class did makeup work, and the other half debated the believability of various movies their parents starred in.

      September ended and bled into October, Homecoming Week at SHIELD. For some reason, the powers that be, one Coach Rogers, thought that it would be a good idea to play their rivals for the big game. Bayside High. The schools had exchanged pranks and taunts for decades, and this year was no different. SHIELD may have been a K-12 school with a unique student body, but it still had a high school with teenagers with a penchant for bad decision-making. Nicky Harkness and Tommy Maximoff had surprisingly stayed out of trouble so far this year, surprising everyone. They had also met two girls from Bayside and asked them to the Homecoming dance that upcoming weekend after finding out that the guys they usually hung out with were pretty douchey.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was how Nicky and Tommy ended up on A.C. Slater and Zack Morris’s radar. It didn’t help that Slater was also Bayside’s star quarterback and Morris was their star running back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tensions that week had been running high. Teachers were on alert, security teams were on alert, and even parents were on alert. Dressup days were decades-themed, and there were different events held every day. While Rio always enjoyed themed weeks and homecoming in general, she was not looking forward to quarterly exams the following week. However, it was a necessary evil to get to the fall break, which kicked off her series of events with Agatha. The premiere, NYC weekend with SNL, and then Halloween.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had been looking forward to the second half of October since it had been decided over Labor Day weekend, and she found herself daydreaming about it. She was also anxious about spending a weekend, just the two of them, in New York. They would be staying at Agatha’s place, and while she could stay in the guest room, she knew where she would actually sleep. Her feelings for Agatha kept growing and becoming harder to ignore. Every touch, every lingering glance, every time she was so close to Agatha that she could hear her breathing and smell the scent of her skin. She needed to at least share with Agatha why she had her rule in place. She just worried that once that was all out in the open, Agatha would see her differently. That scared her almost as much as losing her did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Thankfully, other than some trash-talking online and at the game, everything had gone smoothly between the two schools. While there had been several almost fights among players, students, and parents, nothing had happened at the game. The players were at a celebratory after-game party, and the six women were at Agatha’s. Agatha was still on high alert, however, just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I just feel like something’s going to happen,” Agatha said for the fourth or fifth time since they had been at her house. Each pair of women had a designated couch now. Agatha and Rio had the middle couch, Nat and Wanda to their left, and Alice and Jen on their right. They had gotten pizza, and their various drinks were scattered around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Aggie,” Nat started “There’s security with the boys, and they’re fine.” She reassured her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So they’re going to a high school dance with girls from a rival school who are technically dating football players from the other team. What’s the worst that could happen?” Jen teased. “Did they learn that from you, Harkness?” She added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mother, son, and nephew bonding?” Rio asked before looking over at Wanda. “You need better role models for your sons, Maximoff.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Et, tu, Brute?” Agatha looked at Rio, feigning shock and hurt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice laughed. “At least they know how to fight.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Real reassuring everyone,” Agatha said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Usually, I’m the one that worries, and I’m not worried,” Wanda said nonchalantly, snuggling up against Nat with a yawn.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “As long as I can focus on positive PR, I’m good,” Jen added, her arm around Alice, smiling at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re all disgusting,” Agatha murmured. Rio was pressed against her side, and if anyone who didn’t know their status saw them, they would assume they too, were dating. The painful truth tore at Agatha. She was getting close to wanting to ditch her rule of not dating parents. There weren’t many rules Agatha was afraid of breaking or bending. She had done a lot of things to survive and get where she was today. This, however, was more for her son. The no relationships period rule was for her. She had had one relationship in her life, and it had gone poorly. No one knew about it, and only Wanda knew snippets. Hell, Wanda didn’t even know who the woman was. It would always be Agatha’s secret.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had to get to a point where she could share that with Rio, and she didn’t know if she could.

      The boys and their dates were taking pictures around the compound and looked adorable. Tommy, Nicky, Billy, and Billy’s ‘friend’, Eddie, were wearing matching suits. Tommy’s date, a girl named Kelly from Bayside, was wearing a silver spaghetti strap dress with a sweetheart neckline and a flared skirt that came to her knees. She had matching silver heels, and her hair was pulled up. Tommy had a matching silver vest and bowtie with his suit to match. Jessie’s dress was a strapless purple number that managed to be fitted but appropriate for a sixteen-year-old. She had black heels, and her hair reminded Agatha of her own, long, wild curls with a mind of their own. Nicky’s vest and bowtie were purple to match Jessie’s dress, and Agatha teared up at how he looked simultaneously grown up and like he was still her little boy. Then there was Billy and Eddie. Billy had a blue vest and red bow tie, and Eddie with a blue bow tie and red vest. The six of them all looked amazing. The three women who had known Nicky and the twins since birth had tears in their eyes. Even Rio was tearing up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took pictures and sent them to Alice, even though she and Jen were out on their own date.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After the pictures, the teenagers left for dinner and the dance. Everything had gone fine the night before after the game, and Agatha was still oddly anxious waiting for something bad to happen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The last pictures they had taken were taken on a balcony at Agatha’s house, and they had all come back through the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m getting a drink,” Agatha announced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We are going to Nat’s place for date night since we can do that,” Wanda stated, grabbing Nat’s hand and leading her towards the door. “Love you both, have fun, confess your feelings, bye!” She said, closing the door behind them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re a bitch, and there’s nothing to confess!” Agatha yelled before the door closed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was leaning against the bar with her face buried in her hands, ears pink. “Why do they keep doing this shit?” She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “At this point, it’s just poking the bear,” Agatha said, pouring whiskey into her coke, handing one to Rio. “Cheers to shitty friends that mean well.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She lifted her head, taking the glass with one hand and putting the other on the cool marble of the bar. “Cheers,” Rio said, lifting her glass as she clinked it against Agatha’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They turned and assumed their usual positions on the couch, their sides pressed against each other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio poked her tongue in her cheek, trying to decide if she wanted to stay in safe waters or go deeper. She had so many things she wanted to ask, but she wasn’t sure if she was ready to cross into those territories quite yet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha decided for both of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What are you wearing to the premiere?” Agatha asked, trying to sound innocent.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at her, pretend shock on her face. “You know good and well that I have been sworn to secrecy, and no one is allowed to say anything!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had given them all very specific instructions not to tell each other what they were wearing. They were all getting ready together, and they would see then, but for some reason, it was very hush-hush until then. Agatha didn’t understand it either, and she had been doing this her whole life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We are riding together. We are getting ready together with the same make-up and hair team, at my house. I do not understand why we can’t tell each other. Yet, just to prepare you, it’s this way for every red-carpet event. Whether it’s a premiere or an awards show.” Agatha looked over at her to gauge her reaction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio met her gaze, trying to read the look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why would you need to prepare me?” Rio asked, searching her eyes. She needed Agatha to confirm it,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well,” Agatha was trying to put it in just the right words. “For any future awards shows or premieres, I was hoping you would go with me. As my new standing red carpet buddy. Wanda will probably start showing off her not exactly new girlfriend, and Nicky is getting too cool to go with his mom…” She trailed off, she hadn’t broken eye contact with Rio, and while she was trying to play it off, her eyes were soft and drew her in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew this was Agatha’s way of asking her to stay in her life, a commitment of sorts. Rio nodded, her own eyes were a reflection of Agatha’s. “Yes.” She whispered. She didn’t know when they had leaned into one another or how they had, once again, gotten this dangerously close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could feel Rio’s breath on her face and her body was buzzing everywhere it connected with Rio’s. She so badly wanted to cross that line, but if they were going to do that, some things needed to be said first, and that wasn’t happening tonight. She quickly turned and stood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I need another drink? Do you?” She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, clearing her head. “Just water.” Water was much safer.

      They had fallen asleep watching The Craft, Rio tucked against Agatha, her arms around her, when Agatha’s phone rang. She jolted awake and looked at the time. It was only 10:30 and she hadn’t heard Nicky come in, she grabbed the phone and saw Lilia Calderu’s name on the screen, which shocked her into alertness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lilia? What’s wrong?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had woken up when Agatha’s phone went off. When she heard the panic in her voice and the name, she grabbed her shoes and phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’ll be right there.” Agatha hung up and went to call Wanda, only to see that Rio was hanging up her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda and Nat are on the way here, and we’ll go to the school together. Wanda’s calling Vis.” She said, grabbing their purses.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How?” Agatha asked as they headed to the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Your voice, the look on your face, and I could hear everything Lilia said through the phone.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So you know the Bayside football players showed up, and there was a fight?” Agatha relayed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes. She didn’t say how serious it was. Shouldn’t be too bad, though.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When the four women reached the school, Jen was already there in full PR mode, as were a few other PR reps for some other families. As it turned out, it was worse than they thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky, Tommy, and a few other football players from both the varsity and junior varsity teams had decided to stop by Bayside on the way to the dance. The victory the night before had been solid, 28 -7, and they had learned about some rather degrading treatment of the girls on campus by boys across the school in general. The SHIELD team took it upon themselves to cross out ‘Tigers’ on the field, replaced it with ‘pussycats’, and stole the head of their mascot’s costume, flying it up the flagpole on the SHIELD campus. They had used paint that would wash off the field easily and planned to return the head on Monday. No major damage and it was all pretty harmless. The problem came when the Bayside football team crashed the dance as students were departing, and a fight broke out in the parking lot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was more worried about legal ramifications and the physical well-being of the kids than anything else, which was what Wanda and most parents were also worried about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicholas, are you okay?” She asked, rushing to where he was sitting in the clinic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m fine, Mom. Slater won’t be able to open his left eye for a while though,” he said with a small smile and winced when she hugged him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicky? What’s wrong?” She asked, alarm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He didn’t block correctly and took a blow to the ribcage,” Nat said, storming in. “I checked the cameras, and have already had a word with security.” Her accent was thick as she joined Wanda and Vision with the twins.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head. “Will you and Tommy please not start shit?” She asked, checking him over for any other damages.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky just scoffed as he looked down. Rio had sidled up next to Agatha and had a comforting hand on her lower back, helping to ease her anxiety. It had worked, as Agatha wasn’t shaking as she had been before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put her hand on Nicky’s shoulder and squeezed. “I’m just glad you and your cousins didn’t get seriously hurt.” She smiled at him, and he returned it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew how they looked right now, and she didn’t care. Let people talk. Jen could spin it to be like another Wagatha situation. Why that stung her, she wasn’t sure.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       You know why.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Her inner voice said. She ignored it as she put her arm around Rio’s waist and gave her a quick side hug.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No one was pressing charges, though there had been a heated debate over who had been in the wrong and what the appropriate consequences were. Security footage proved that Bayside had attacked first and SHIELD students had defended. Tommy had a few scrapes and bruises but was fine. Billy had stayed out of it. A few other students were a little scuffed up. Students were picked up, and the excitement died down. Agatha had left the clinic and joined Lilia in dealing with the few police officers who had shown up. Wanda and Vision gathered the twins to go home, letting Rio know, while Nat figured out exactly why security had been nowhere to be found during the scuffle. Jen and a few other reps were scrubbing pictures off of social media, Alice was talking with the teachers who had chaperoned the event, and Rio was sitting with Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Your mother was worried.” She said, “What
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       actually
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      happened?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What do you mean?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know what I mean.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Those guys are real jerks. It’s funny how people think we’re these elitist snobs, or completely out of touch, but we’re not. They’re the ones who don’t know how to treat people.” He said, looking at the ground. They were sitting in the office lobby now, an ice pack on his rib cage. “The girls over there aren’t treated nicely by the guys and they say mean things to the LGBTQ+ kids…it’s like a stereotypical high school you see on TV, Rio.” He looked like a lost puppy, hurt to discover the world's injustices.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, kid. I’ll make sure to tell Lilia, and maybe she can talk to the principal. What could you do about it? How could you spread awareness about how not to be a teenage douchecanoe? You’re the child of one of the most famous people in the world. You have a platform.” She knew he wanted to make a difference and knew that he could if he wanted to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you honestly believe that? That I could inspire others?” He asked, looking hopeful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Your mom is Agatha Fucking Harkness, kid. Which makes you Nicholas Fucking Harkness. You are unstoppable.” She grinned and ruffled his hair. “You can do anything.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had watched the exchange, and while she wasn’t sure what was said, she could see it had been a heartfelt conversation that ended in grins and her son being comforted by the woman she was falling for.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She is just as scared, hurt, and cautious as you are. If you would just open up and take a chance, you might find love again.” Lilia said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha jumped. She had no idea when the woman had drawn up beside her, but here she was in all of her wisdom. Agatha looked around, noticing that everyone had left or was in the process of doing so.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What are the consequences?” Completely ignoring what the principal had said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “For the boys? They’ll clean up Bayside’s field tomorrow and do whatever exercises Rogers has for them. However, I believe Nicky has something to tell me, and an investigation into student conduct will be open at Bayside. He’s a good kid with a good heart. Like his mother, despite her rough exterior,” she looked over at Agatha. “For you? Well, if you don’t finally open up, then you lose that amazing woman in there, and you go back to your old ways, and you’re as miserable as you ever were. If you do open up and get rid of that stupid rule? Well, hopefully, she follows suit and everything works out.” Lilia looked back at Rio, who was looking at things on her phone with Nicky and pointing at something on the screen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re not talking in riddles right now. Why?” She looked over questioningly. Lilia was rarely this candid.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know why. Now take those two and go home, Agatha.” With that, Lilia turned and left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just shook her head and walked through the doors into the office. “C’mon, you two. Let’s go.” She smiled and led the way out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they rode back to the compound, Agatha thought about the night's events. Rio had stayed. She had called Wanda automatically without hesitating, hadn’t once complained, had swooped in, comforted Nicky, sat with him, and waited with him. Even now, Nicky had fallen asleep leaning on Rio. This woman, who had only been in their lives for two months, had stepped up, been a calming presence, and shown up for both of them without being asked.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Like a partner would.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was two a.m. by the time they got home. Nicky hugged Rio and thanked her, before hugging Agatha and whispering ‘I like her’ in his mom’s ear. He waved and went upstairs to bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio yawned. “I’m going to head out myself.” She grabbed her bag and turned before Agatha caught her arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s been a long night and a rough one at that. Will you…” Agatha hated being vulnerable, and she had never actually asked Rio to stay before. It just had worked out that way. Rio turned, looking at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew that they were in deep at this point. Very deep. To the point that they would soon need oxygen masks. The normally collected woman before her was anything but. While the night's events had turned out to be a minor innocent, Rio had seen the panic and fear on Agatha’s face and heard it in her voice. She could see the adrenaline wearing off and knew that she was still in need of comfort. The great Agatha Harkness, as rough around the edges as she could be, just needed someone to hold her and tell her everything was going to be okay. At that moment, Rio desperately wanted to be that person for her. She would take away all of her pain, trauma, and fear if she could.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Forever and Always.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She just nodded before responding. “Okay, Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew that it would have been so easy to close the gap between them right now. To cup Agatha’s face before sliding her hands into her hair as she kissed her, and damn. She wanted to. She wanted to feel her lips against her, wanted to explore her mouth with her tongue, bite her lip, swallow her moans...
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       No. You can’t risk it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha thought for a moment and knew she had to think quickly. She was vulnerable, what Lilia had said was still fresh in her mind, and yet, she didn’t want to fuck anything up. If she and Rio went upstairs, she wouldn’t be able to trust herself not to do something stupid. The couch was the safer option of the two. Letting Rio go home had been the better option, but she needed her. Honestly, she and Rio needed to be on different continents to be safest, yet here they were.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She led Rio to the couch and they positioned themselves in a way that Agatha had her back leaning against Rio’s chest, Rio’s legs on either side of Agatha, Rio’s back against the arm of the couch. Rio played with Agatha’s hair as they turned on a random TV show.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What were you and Nicky talking about?” Agatha asked, remembering how intently they had been speaking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh! Something is happening at Bayside. We need to talk to Calderu. Nicky said that it’s a very typical high school like you would see on TV; bullying, homophobia, misogyny. He wants to do something about it, and we talked about how he can use his proximity to fame to rally other teens to use their collective voices and be a force for change. He’s such a great kid. You should be so proud of yourself, Aggie,” Rio’s voice was full of admiration and awe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s heart swelled, not only because of Nicky but because of how Rio had talked about him. “Thank you for being there for him. That meant a lot to me. Just the way that you jumped in and took control of everything.” She was thankful that Rio couldn't see her face as she bit back tears. “Not many people would have done that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I care about you both, you’re…important to me, Agatha. With that comes Nicky. I’m fond of the kid, whether I’m his teacher or not. He’s an extension of you. I’m going to treat him like he’s mine.” She smoothed the ends of Agatha’s hair.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       You might as well tattoo ‘Just Friends’ on your foreheads at this point to remind yourselves.’
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      It was one of the many reasons this couldn’t go any further. She couldn’t hurt Nicky like that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The words ‘like he’s mine’ stayed with Agatha and landed, like so many other things with Rio, in her heart. It’s what she had wanted, wasn’t it? Someone who truly cared about them both? Someone who wasn’t there to try and be a second parent necessarily but wasn’t afraid to love and guide him either?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maybe they could just wait until Nicky graduated Agatha thought. Jen and Alice had waited years to finally get together, and Nat waited twenty years to fully get Wanda back. It was less than two years, and as smart as Nicky was, he could probably graduate earlier. Then she would just need to find a way to open up about why she had shied away from relationships. No, they wouldn’t make it that long, either. They were doing a bad job at making the two-month mark.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Useless lesbians.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Despite her inner turmoil, the adrenaline had worn off and Agatha couldn’t resist sleep anymore, not while Rio absentmindedly played with her hair, the smell of Rio’s eucalyptus shampoo filling her nostrils.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt Agatha’s body become heavier against hers, knowing she had succumbed to sleep. She knew Agatha needed it and was glad she had finally let herself find it. Meanwhile, Rio was mid-crisis. She was attempting to suppress feelings and recreate boundaries, but those lines were all but erased at this point. She managed to sleep for a few hours, but only due to her personal Agatha-shaped weighted blanket.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She remembered they had shifted in their sleep and was not entirely surprised to wake up sandwiched between the back of the couch and Agatha. Agatha’s back was flush against Rio’s front, Rio’s arm over her middle, Agatha holding her hand. She breathed in the familiar lavender scent that she now associated with the woman in her arms and let herself to just be. It was moments like this when Rio didn't have to be scared of Agatha, the possibility of them together, and all the ways it could go horribly wrong. Rio relaxed, imagining all the good without the risk of the bad.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before she fell asleep again, Rio wiggled away, grateful that Agatha was such a heavy sleeper. Rio quietly gathered her things and left. She needed to prepare for the final week before break and had things to think about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As she glanced back at Agatha, sleeping peacefully, she tried to crystalize the scene and how happy she felt right now in her heart and mind.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I can't lose her
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , she thought.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       No matter what I am feeling, I have to turn it off. It can't turn out that way again
      </span>

      Rio found herself storming into Alice’s apartment Sunday evening after a day of preparing for mid-terms and quarterly finals. She had also been reflecting on her feelings all day. She was happy being Agatha’s friend, she really was. There were also feelings there, and she needed to get them out and talk to the one person she could always count on to help her keep a level head. The one person who knew everything. She sent Alice a quick text to let her know she was coming over in case Jen had been there. Rio was agitated and had to get out her frustrations. It was impossible to turn these feelings off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen was sitting cross-legged in an armchair, typing statements from last night's teenage shenanigans. Alice was on the couch and offered Rio a cider, which she declined.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, I’ve had enough alcohol the past two months. Maybe I need to stop drinking. Maybe I need to keep a clear head.” She said, agitated, as she gestured wildly while pacing around the living room. She had sat much of the day while preparing for the week and now Rio needed to move.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at Alice and raised an eyebrow. Alice shook her head once. She knew Rio and knew she needed to let everything out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t date parents. I don’t. We both know there’s a fucking good reason for that. That two-year affair in San Francisco nearly KILLED me, Alice, you saw me. You came to the hospital and saw me.” She realized that Jen was present and quickly turned to look at her. “Say a damn word of any of this to anyone, and I’ll make a phone call to Nat. She owes me a favor,” She said, pointing a finger in Jen’s direction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at Rio with confusion for a moment. “Why would Nat…” the pieces clicked for her. “OH! You’re the one, got it,” Jen nodded, waving her hand for her to continue.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nothing leaves this apartment,” Rio added, watching as the other two women nodded their agreement. She continued her movements around the room. “Yes, I know this is different, but I almost lost my career. I don’t want another relationship to almost cost me everything again. I don’t want a breakup to cause me to lose a friend, which is the most important part of this dilemma. She means so much to me. I can tell her almost anything. I can’t lose that! I can’t lose this coven of lovable bitches either.” Her gestures were wild, and she roamed every space in the main area of the apartment. This was not a new experience for Alice as her eyes tracked Rio around the room. Jen, however, was amused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Do you know what she asked me last night? She asked me to be her consistent date for red carpet events. Agatha. Agatha Fucking Harkness, who always takes Wanda ‘In Love With the Deadliest Woman Alive’ Maximoff or her own son, wants me to be her forever red-carpet buddy. You know, as FRIENDS. I can count on one hand the number of times she has taken someone that wasn’t one of those two since I’ve been ALIVE.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wait,” Jen interjected, shocked. “I have been with Agatha for ten years, and she has NEVER wanted anyone other than Wanda or Nicky on a red carpet more than once or twice. It’s because of all the pictures that are taken. She doesn’t want to look back and be filled with sadness repeatedly because of what she’s lost. She knows Wanda and Nicky are constants, and she’ll always be filled with happiness and joy when she sees those pictures, no matter what.” Jen looked at her. “Rio, that’s huge.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned against the wall, feeling as if all the air had been sucked from her lungs. Agatha knew that she would always associate good things with Rio. AFTER TWO MONTHS? What kind of witchcraft was happening? Agatha wanted her to be a constant in her life, and Rio so badly wanted that, too, which was what had brought forth this crisis.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hang on, then why were you all so insistent on FORCING her to take me to the premiere? Knowing it was such a big deal to her?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen waved her hand. “Agatha isn’t forced to do anything. If she didn’t want to take you, she wouldn’t, and again, more than once or twice. One premiere, okay. Wanting you to be her constant? Rio. She’s planning on you being beside her, in some capacity.” Jen internally screamed. Everyone had gotten on to her and Alice for taking so damn long to get it together, Wanda and Nat took a quarter of a fucking century, and now Rio and Agatha were alternating between going too fast and slamming on the brakes. Maybe she should have set up a fake dating ploy. Those situations seemed to move more quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded slowly. “So she wants me in her life forever but isn’t sure about the capacity. Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You don’t date parents.” Alice reminded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “EXACTLY! And why don’t I date parents? Because of the bitch back in San Francisco! I fell in love once, ONCE! Everything was going great, but then I found out she was NOT separated from her husband. That she was not going to get a divorce, and I broke it off, because OBVIOUSLY. She didn’t get the hint. Suddenly, she’s EVERYWHERE. Do you know how odd it is for a teacher to have to get a restraining order against a parent of a student?” She was power-walking all over Alice’s apartment at this point.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at Alice. “Is she just monologuing?” She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked back, “She does this. I just go with it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio kept going like the Energizer bunny, not even hearing them, “Long story very short, Jen, I survived but ended up in the hospital with sustained injuries from the fucking husband! Swore off parents after that. Calderu knows, yet even SHE seems to want this. I also don’t trust that bitch not to show back up solely because she’s the jealous type, and I have to keep everyone safe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And then, THEN, there’s the NICKY of it all. I fucking love that kid! I’ve known that damn kid for TWO MINUTES, and I would do anything for him. He’s so much like her, the mischievous little shit. If anyone had said it was his fault last night, I would’ve caused some damage of my own. Do you know why he and Tommy wanted to take those girls out? Because the Bayside dickheads are misogynistic assholes, and our boys wanted to learn more to know what THEY could do to raise awareness about douchey behavior in high schools. Who does that sound like? His activist mother. That’s who. He is an amazing kid and I would be so proud to be a part of his life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I shared what he told me with Agatha and I’m sure she let Lilia know since Lilia listens to her for some unknown reason. The kid is 16 and has more empathy in his pinky than some grown-ass adults because the people that raised him, I know it wasn’t ALL Agatha, are just that fucking good. Another reason I can’t risk any of this is because this family that I have been accepted into is so amazing. Alice, it’s always just been you and me, and now, I have this whole family, and I can’t lose that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, we have an ENTIRE WEEKEND in New York, BY OURSELVES. I’m not canceling whatsoever. Of course, we’ll be sharing a fucking bed because we can’t spend the night under the same roof and sleep separately. We’re so fucking gay for each other, but I can’t lose this, and I can’t lose her, and I can’t risk anything, but sleeping next to her is the most natural thing in the world. I didn’t even feel that way with the stalker chick. Sharing a bed with you, Alice is like sleeping next to my sister because you are. This? This is something entirely different, and I can’t put it into words yet. Anytime we spend the night in the same house, I want us to wake up in each other’s arms because I feel like that’s where we belong, and it scares the hell out of me.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Yet I can’t get over my OWN issues long enough to even tell her what MY fucking bullshit is, and I don’t want to hurt either of them. So here I am ranting to you two lovesick idiots, don’t deny it, while she probably is just enjoying her wine night with those other lesbians finally living their truth.” Her eyes were wild, cheeks flushed from the constant movement. She gulped down her water while she tried to slow her breathing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked at her calmly. “Rio. As you said, it’s been two months. The San Francisco thing was bad, I know. I saw you in the hospital. I almost killed that bitch myself. It won’t happen again, and you need to tell Agatha everything. You both need to lay all your cards on the table and decide, like the adults you both claim you are, if it’s worth it. However, it has only been two months.” She knew Rio was worried, and her feelings were valid, but Rio was in deep and needed to talk to Agatha sooner rather than later. Alice wanted to see her truly happy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smiled at Rio, “I can tell you that you can tell Agatha anything, and it won’t change how she sees you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio huffed. “Right. Two months,” She chewed on the inside of her cheek as she thought about everything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t give yourself an aneurysm,” Jen remarked, seeing the gears turning in Rio’s mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You have time to work everything out, Ri. Neither of you is going anywhere. Agatha is beginning to film, which means less time together and not as much texting. That’s a good thing. Keep it friendly in New York, have fun at the Halloween party, and then we’ll make it through the holidays. After the first of the year, she’ll be on location for filming, and the distance will be good for both of you.” Alice offered. “Just keep building on this.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “Okay. Yes. Less time together could be good,” She had started moving again, refilling her water.  “I need to suppress these feelings, ignore them, and they will eventually go away. Maybe I’ll go on a few dates, maybe I’ll read more, actually tend to my plants more, and pick up some other hobbies. YES. Will I ever lay my soul bare for her? Maybe. Right now, I’m going to go home to my cat.” With that, she walked out of the door. Alice buried her head in her hands as Jen looked at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why is she an idiot?” Jen asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked up at her. “I blame her parents. My mother had an influence too. Gran tried so hard with both of us. She really did.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen shook her head, “She’s not going to suppress a damn thing, is she?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice stood and stretched, “She’ll try, I give it until Halloween. I don’t see her going on a date.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smiled. “Imagine. If she even mentioned it, they would mysteriously cancel. Wanda would make sure of it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Rio tried to settle herself for the night, she kept thinking about the monologue and conversation at Alice’s.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       If I’m ready to tell her about why I have my rule, then am I ready to hear why she has hers, and be rejected?

      Agatha had woken up alone, a blanket tucked around her, and a text from Rio explaining she had to get home and would talk to her later. It was probably for the best since Nicky was home. He didn’t need to see them spooning on the couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was in the kitchen fixing her coffee and making pancakes when her son walked in, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Where’s Rio?” He asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was thankful for all the years of acting experience as she kept her face blank and put pancakes on a plate for him. “She went home last night.” She handed him his plate and turned back to the stove to finish breakfast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was not stupid. “Mom. She spends the night every Saturday when you guys have movie night. You cuddle. The twins and I know everything. We’re even in the betting pool.” He said with a smirk. He was her son. Agatha didn’t know why she underestimated him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She flipped the pancakes and turned to look at him, shock on her face. “Excuse me, young man?” His admission had taken her by surprise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m
      <em>
       your
      </em>
      son and, therefore, the second smartest person in the room, Mom. Anyone with eyes can see you two are attracted to each other. Like I said last night. I like her.” He carefully watched her reaction to make sure he hadn’t overstepped.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She finished the pancakes, plated them, and turned off the stove. “You have a field to clean up today,” She said, taking her own breakfast to the table as she thought about what he had said. “Have I told you what a great kid you are?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I had some pretty decent role models. By that, I mean Uncle Vision and Aunt Nat,” He grinned as she playfully smacked his arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Smartass.” She laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Learned from the best.” He smiled at her as he took a seat at the table. “I love you, Mom,” he gave her an honest look before nearly inhaling his breakfast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love you too, kid,” She smiled back before laughing. “You eat like Rio does.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He gave her a mischievous look before putting down his fork. “See, already picking up habits from my future stepmother.” He bolted upstairs to get ready before she could process what he said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her jaw dropped before she just groaned. “Assholes. I’m surrounded by assholes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By Sunday evening, while Rio was going on her diatribe, Agatha was going on one of her own. She was lesbian spreading on her couch while Wanda and Nat were being disgustingly cute on what was now their couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You two are disgusting,” Agatha said, rolling her eyes, drinking water of all things. She needed to be sober. She had told them about the conversation with Nicky this morning and Wanda had excitedly told her that had meant she could drop her rule. Agatha, however, was too hard-headed for that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please, we’ve always been like this when it’s just the three of us,” Wanda responded. “You’re just sensitive.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am not,” Agatha argued. “Anyway, back to me. Even if I did drop the no-teacher rule, I still don’t have relationships and can’t risk losing Rio. That’s what the whole thing boils down to. I have to tell her why I refuse to have a relationship, but what if it’s something she can’t handle? What if it changes the way she looks at me? I fell in love once, and it went badly. I refuse even to tell the two of you everything.” Agatha shook her head as if to shake the memories away. “I know I was much younger, and so much has changed since then. I know what it’s like to be the younger person in a relationship, and it’s hard. I think she could handle it a lot better than I did though.” She smiled sadly as she continued. “I’m not sure how she would handle the fame and pressure, though. It’s a lot, and it’s a big conversation to be had if we even got to that point. As for the teacher thing, as long as Nicky understood that this did not change anything and that he would not get any special treatment, then that could be changed. That’s a newer rule, anyway. It’s the no relationship rule that I’m more inclined to stick with.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda stared at her. “For the smartest person I know, you’re an idiot. Nothing you say is going to change the way she feels about you. She also has Vision and Nat for support on dating a megastar. I know you still outshine me. You always will. Don’t look at me like that. In my eyes, you will always be THE Agatha Harkness, and I will ALWAYS be in your shadow. ALWAYS. Your last relationship was decades ago. I still don’t even know who it was, and only Nat and I even know you had a relationship. Rio will want to be public with you. You just have to talk to her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded, placing a kiss on Wanda’s head. “Red’s right. We tease, and we push, but Agatha, in the 27 years I’ve known you, not once have I seen you look at someone the way I’ve seen you look at Rio Vidal. It’s been a little over two months, and if I didn’t know the circumstances, I would think you two had been together for years.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda turned and kissed Nat on the cheek before turning back to Agatha. “We’re not going to stop meddling either because Rio looks at you like you’re the only person in the room. Yes, it’s only been two months, yet you’ve even said yourself that it feels incredibly natural and like you’ve known each other for years. So why does actual time matter? I don’t think the age gap even matters to you anymore, even if it scared you at first and now I know why. This is Hollywood! Age gaps are everywhere! Sixteen years is NOTHING here. Sarah is a dear friend of yours, and Holland is thirty-four years older than she is. That’s almost as long as Rio has been alive, and that’s not even the largest. Get over yourself, Harkness.” Wanda loved Agatha and wanted what was best for her. If she needed to be both the voice of reason and the person pushing her off the cliff, she would be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was processing everything. It was a lot to take in. “Filming is about to pick up a lot, and I’ll be in New York for SNL rehearsals, then back here for the premiere, then back in New York for our weekend together where I am set on nothing happening.” She ignored the clearly disappointed looks on her friends' faces. “Back here for more filming, and then Halloween.” She looked down at her lap, knowing she needed to tell Wanda what she had asked Rio. “I asked Rio to be my companion for premieres and award shows…” She barely got it out before Wanda sat up and squealed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why didn’t you lead with that?” Wanda asked with excitement in her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t want you to get too excited. I know you’ll want to start going with Nat, and Nicky is getting too old to join Mom.” She waved it off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, whatever. Justify it all you want but Agatha Harkness does not ask someone to be her recurring date for major events if she doesn’t think they’ll be a permanent fixture in her life. You want to slow down, yet you’re speeding up, too. You’re an idiot.” Wanda shook her head as she reassumed her position against Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Look who’s talking.” Agatha shot back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Go to hell,” Wanda replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think she’s already in one of her own making,” Nat said knowingly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just grimaced. If anyone knew how she was feeling, it was those two. She couldn’t help but think to herself that maybe she was ready for something more with Rio.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       You absolutely can’t stand to be away from her, and when you are with her you can’t help but touch her. You imagine kissing her or other things.
      </span>

<span>
      Now, how could she get her to open up about Rio’s no-parents’ rule?

      Midterm week went by both slowly and too quickly. Rio was looking forward to the next week’s events, however, she had a lot to wrap up and a very short amount of time. She somehow managed to complete everything by the final bell on Friday, and thankfully, there were no football games for the next two weeks. Her exhaustion was apparent as she just dropped her bag by the entryway as she walked into her apartment. The first nine weeks had been completed, and she was thankful for the week off. She barely got to the couch before collapsing, kicking her shoes off, when her phone dinged.
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      Hey, filming for the day will run
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      later than I thought. Want to
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      grab a late dinner?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio read the message and thought about it. They hadn’t seen each other all week, and she missed Agatha. She was also tired and knew if Agatha came over, she would fall asleep on her, Agatha would stay, and they would end up spending most of the weekend together. The following weekend would be New York weekend, and Rio was supposed to be backing off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Me:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I am exhausted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Probably will turn in
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      early. Sorry!
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She refused to focus on the pain in her chest when she hit send. Of course, she wanted to grab a late dinner. She wanted to order something, have Agatha come over, and then go to bed together. Instead, she ignored Agatha’s reply, put her phone down, and let the exhaustion overtake her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha responded with a quick “okay.” She didn’t expect a reply. Agatha wanted this after all, she had wanted to back off, right? This would be fine. They would have movie night this weekend, and everything would be back to normal. The premiere was Wednesday, and New York was next weekend. Everything would be fine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could have murdered their friends. All six of them were gathered for movie night, and Wanda had shirts made for the four meddling bitches. They all said Team Get Together All Ready, causing Rio and Agatha to blush. Wanda thought it was hilarious and Rio had rolled her eyes while blushing. While Wanda had said she would continue meddling, Agatha preferred when it was more subtle. She had already made a concerted effort to sit in a way where Rio would not cuddle up next to her, and it felt like Wanda was rubbing salt in the wound. It felt wrong not to have Rio right next to her. This was going to be painful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had taken that opportunity to address the upcoming premiere on Wednesday. Agatha would spend much of the week in New York, and Jen wanted to take advantage of everyone in one place.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, we know the media will jump on why you didn’t go with each other since you're co-starring, and historically, that’s what you’ve done before anytime you’ve done projects together or been nominated together. So what do you want your statements to be?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was still taking Vision, as nothing on that front would change until after the holidays. “While Agatha and I are co-stars, Vision has been another constant support in my life, and with the importance of this movie, it felt right for him to be here.” She stated, staring at Nat the entire time. Nat would be there in the wings like she always was. Wanda was hopeful that Nat would be her date at the Golden Globes. She would let Jen handle the PR shit show.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen wrote it down, knowing it would be picked apart in a few months. She looked at the two women, desperately trying to distance themselves from each other. “Agatha?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha thought about it, knowing no matter what she said, it would be spun however the media or fans wanted to spin it. No comment would almost be worse. “Rio is a close friend of mine, and her support means a lot to me.” She said as she made eye contact with Rio. It was a simple statement that held a lot of weight to it. Rio nodded her agreement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked around before landing on Alice. “Someone is going to see you and know who you are.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shrugged. “Fuck ‘em. I’ll stay as hidden as I can and handle it if I need to.” Alice generally didn’t attend anything but wanted to start supporting her friends, especially with Rio entering this world now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked back at the two movie stars. “You know there’s going to be a lot of questions, and Nat will step in if she needs to. I know you can handle it, but this is very out of character for you both.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It will be fine,” Agatha reassured her before looking over at Rio, who was looking at Agatha intently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll have you next to me. I can handle anything,” Rio said, forgetting the four other women in the room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “JUST KISS ALREADY!” Jen cried, breaking the tension, as Agatha glared at her and Rio stared at the floor uncomfortably.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen regained her composure, “I think we’re good,” she said, normally, putting away her notebook and nodding at Alice to start the move, trying to suppress her laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned back to Rio, speaking quietly. “What did that mean?” She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just shrugged, trying to play it off. “You’re Agatha Fucking Harkness. Who is going to come after me when you’re by my side..”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “True….” Agatha gave her a small smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned her attention to the movie. Here she was trying to distance herself, and yet she was running straight towards Agatha again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the movie went on, every shared whisper and comment brought the two women closer together, inch by inch. Soon, Agatha found that they were just about in their familiar cuddling position.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Well, that lasted.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She thought but sighed, relieved.

<p>
<span>
      Agatha had flown back from New York Wednesday morning. Now, here she was with her and Wanda’s team prepping them and Rio, for the night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why am I nervous? We’ve done this most of our lives.” Agatha asked Wanda as she checked her final look in the full-length mirror in her bathroom. She wore a fitted black suit with a lace bra underneath instead of a shirt. Her hair was parted to the side in loose waves, signature locket on a chain around her neck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because there’s so much pressure on this movie to be amazing, and the woman you refuse to date is getting ready across the hall,” Wanda replied. Her auburn hair was done in an updo to show off ruby drop earrings. Her black sequin halter dress had a deep v-neck just below her sternum and came to her knee before opening in a split and showing off her red-bottom black heels. If anyone asked her though, her favorite part was that it had pockets.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just shook her head. “I am not
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       refusing
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      to date her. It hasn’t even come up. We’ve agreed just to be friends.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda clicked her tongue. “How long are you going to lie to yourself?” She asked sincerely.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t answer, she looked herself over one more time in the mirror before walking out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was waiting downstairs with Vision and the other three women. Vision appeared every inch the doting, supportive husband in a dapper black suit. He was in conversation with Nat, who looked every part the bodyguard in her suit. Rio admired them both for how much they had done for Wanda and how they had stood by her all this time. Jen wore a pink and black ombre suit and Alice had chosen a simple black dress, hoping to blend into the background. Rio however, couldn’t blend in if she tried. Jen, Agatha’s stylist, with help from Wanda, Rio presumed, had worked together to choose her outfit. It was a strapless cream dress that came to her mid-thigh with a black lace floor-length overlay. Her hair was half up, half down, and for some reason, she was eager to see Agatha’s reaction to the look. Rio also couldn’t wait to see Agatha’s, for that matter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There are the stars of the evening.” Vision announced as Wanda and Agatha entered the room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned around and forgot how to breathe. Agatha a natural beauty, looked even more stunning than usual. As she approached Rio, Rio regained her ability to function like a normal human.  Agatha smiled, tucking her hair behind her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You look amazing.” They said simultaneously and laughed nervously, quietly routinely admiring each other’s outfits.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They’re like teenagers on prom night,” Wanda said to the others with a smirk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pretended not to hear her, nor did she really care. Before her, Rio was gorgeous, and for once, she, Agatha Fucking Harkness, was nearly speechless. “You, just, wow.” Agatha breathed, blushing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had also turned red, “You too.” She replied, before adding. “As a friend, of course.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course,” Agatha said, feeling like she had just taken a punch to the gut.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Liars,” Wanda said to them as she walked past, leading everyone to the two SUV’s that were waiting for them outside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Will one of you keep her in line?” Agatha asked, speaking to Nat and Vision.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision laughed. “Neither of us is capable of that, and you know it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they arrived at the theatre where the premiere was, Rio was nervous. She knew there would be questions, cameras, and lights. It was all overwhelming. She felt Agatha’s hand on her thigh, and she stopped shaking her leg. She hadn’t even noticed she was doing it until she felt Agatha’s hand, and the accompanying jolt of electricity from the touch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey,” Agatha said quietly, getting her attention. “If you get nervous, just look at me, okay?” She gave Rio that genuine smile that was reserved for just a few people, as her blue eyes looked deeply into Rio’s. “Everything will be fine. It’s a few minutes outside, and there are a few interviews that I’ll handle. Then we go inside and watch the movie. Afterward, more pictures, a few more interviews, and back to my house so you can go home. Sound like a plan?” Agatha’s voice was calming, her eyes were soft, and in that moment, Rio would have followed her anywhere with the way she was speaking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yeah, I can do this. Don't walk too far off and abandon me to the wolves, Harkness."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Never," Agatha replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen cleared her throat. “I hate to break up whatever that moment is, but it’s time to exit the vehicle.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha broke the eye contact as she scooted to the door. “Right, let’s go.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Other movie stars were already there, posing for pictures and speaking with the media. Wanda and Agatha, as the two movie leads, were at the very end of the line. Wanda and Vision went first, though the four posed together, and Agatha and Wanda took several pictures with castmates. Nat and three other bodyguards walked with them, followed by Jen. Alice had gone to blend with the crowd.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Cameras were flashing, and questions were being asked from all directions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why didn’t you come as each other's date like you have in the past?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, who’s your date?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What’s your name?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Vision, what do you think about UCLA’s current odds of making a bowl game?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, is this your girlfriend or just your current
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       girl
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, why haven’t you been seen out lately?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda, why haven’t we seen you and Vision together lately?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While they had been making the press circuit, neither star had been seen in public recently, other than school functions, and rumors had been flying. They gave their rehearsed answers and statements and spoke about the movie, before moving into the theatre. As they sat, Rio’s eyes went wide as she turned to Agatha. “Is it always like that?” She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed. “Not always, but I had someone new with me. So, new questions. Now, watch the movie and enjoy seeing me naked.” She winked as Rio blushed. She completely forgot about those scenes. Yes, she had seen Agatha in sex scenes before, but this was different. Completely different.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda leaned over to Rio. “Don’t kill me. While we do kiss, and I am touching her, I’m not actually having sex with your woman.” She whispered conspiratoriously and flashed Rio a shit-eating grin before sitting back in her seat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just groaned. This was going to be a long movie.

<p>
     Rio was captivated by what was unfolding on the screen before her. There was such amazing chemistry between Agatha and Wanda, even she believed they were passionately in love. The beautiful love scene at the end of the movie was the perfect end to this dramatic psychological thriller. Agatha played an FBI agent, married to Wanda, when they began tracking a major serial killer that consumed Agatha’s character. Wanda’s character struggled with nearly losing her wife so many times and trying to be supportive. The emotional roller coaster ending in this physical and naked scene was almost too much for Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had seen Agatha naked in movies plenty of times. However, that was before they were close friends or sitting right next to her. She certainly had never felt awkward during any of Agatha’s intimate scenes, but now? She knew it was fake, yet here she was, not just feeling a little awkward, but bubbling jealousy over Wanda? It was Wanda Maximoff of all people. Wanda, who was madly in love with Nat. Oh yes, calm and collected, Nat. Nat who had years of experience watching these scenes, of watching Wanda film these scenes over and over, and never being able to react publically. Rio couldn’t imagine. She would have incurred assault charges at this point. Where were these thoughts and feelings coming from? She had zero claim to Agatha and no right to be jealous. Agatha could do whatever she wanted with whoever she wanted, couldn’t she?
     <em>
      You want her to be yours
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she just watched the scene before her. Rio’s mind began to wander as she pictured herself with Agatha instead of Wanda. It wasn’t the first time since they became friends that she fantasized about Agatha, putting her various toys to good use. But, this was different. She hadn’t had the imagery and audio to go with it. As the movie played, so did the one in her imagination, which was much better, if you asked her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Rio pressed their mouths together in a needy kiss. Her wife had almost died, and she needed to show her just how much she loved and needed her. Maybe Agatha would stop this futile pursuit before it actually did kill her. She backed her into the wall, deepening the kiss as she slid her tongue across Agatha’s bottom lip before biting it, eliciting a gasp. Rio had one arm around Agatha’s waist and the other hand twisted in her hair. Agatha held Rio securely against her, hands fisted in the back of Rio’s sweater.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Rio slid her tongue against Agatha’s, exploring her mouth, as she spun her and moved her to the bed, clothes shedding as they went.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She lowered Agatha to the bed. “I can’t lose you,” Rio whispered, echoing the line from the actresses and breaking the kiss.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Rio leaned in and kissed Agatha again before trailing kisses down her neck and to her chest, taking Agatha’s right breast in her hand and running her thumb over her hardened nipple. Rio’s imagination now diverging from the movie and in control of the fantasy.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She wrapped her lips around the other nipple and sucked, mimicking the rolling and pulling that she was doing with her fingers. She was rewarded with several gasps and moans. Agatha grabbed her chin and yanked, pulling her up to kiss her again and take control.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha rolled over on top of her, their bodies pressed together everywhere. Rio tried not to shiver visibly, as her body manifested the fantasy. Agatha still had a hold on her jaw and gripped it as she kissed her like she needed all of the oxygen from Rio’s lungs to survive.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      God, why was this also making her cry? Agatha Harkness was on a giant screen, naked, she was fantasizing about her, and she was still captivated by her acting. The build-up was fantastic.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha kissed her again, slower, more deliberately this time, like she was trying to map the layout of her mouth, and Rio responded the same way, tracing Agatha’s tongue, the shape of her lips, the roof of her mouth, everything. Her hands explored Agatha’s back, arms, neck, fingers tracing every muscle.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Her fingers twitched, bringing her back to the moment. She itched to reach out to the woman next to her.
     <em>
      Keep it in your head, Vidal.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha’s hands were on the move, she was straddling Rio, one hand next to Rio’s head for support and the other running down the length of her body, sending sparks of electricity everywhere she touched her skin. She finally reached where Rio wanted her most and shifted to spread Rio’s legs further apart.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The camera was more focused on faces and glimpses of skin, it was all very tasteful, but Rio could take it from here.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha dragged her nails up Rio’s thigh as she gasped from the sensation, gripping Agatha’s shoulders and kissing her harder. Agatha smiled into the kiss before lightly ghosting her fingers over Rio’s core and feeling how wet she was. Rio was filled with heat and want. She needed Agatha to touch her, to make her come. Agatha lightly brushed over Rio’s clit, causing her to whimper. Agatha kissed down Rio’s jaw and down her neck, before licking her pulse point and focusing there. She pressed down on Rio’s hardened clit before making circles around it, causing her hips to buck. As Rio got closer, Agatha stopped, only to push two fingers into Rio’s entrance as she bit down on her neck. Rio cried out as she dug her nails into Agatha’s back and her hips came up to meet Agatha’s thrusts. Agatha pumped in and out, Rio was so close. She slung a leg around Agatha’s waist to allow her to hit a different angle. Agatha pressed her thumb back on Rio’s clit at the same time as she curled her fingers forward and she came hard with a scream.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio broke from her thoughts when she heard Agatha’s moans in real life. Rio had gotten so caught up in her thoughts that she had missed Agatha’s climax scene.
    </p>
<p>
     She squeezed her eyes shut, breathing deeply, and trying to clear her mind and make the heat between her legs go away when Agatha put her hand on hers, leaning over.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll take you to a G-rated movie next time,” She whispered playfully.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      If you only knew,
     </em>
     she thought, as the touch from Agatha sent sparks all over her body and made the flame in her core grow brighter.
     <em>
      Great
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     Rio focused back in on the movie, the sex scene finally over. Agatha’s character came face to face with Agatha’s wife revealed as the killer. The scene had brought Rio to tears. The heartfelt words, the admissions, Agatha knowing it was Wanda but not wanting to admit it to herself. The FBI closed in as Agatha had to decide between letting Wanda’s character go or capturing her as they stood on a pier. Gunshots rang. Wanda had shot Agatha, and Agatha had shot her back. Agatha woke up in the hospital to be told that Wanda’s body hadn’t been found, but by the amount of blood, she had to be dead.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio realized she was holding Agatha’s hand. Agatha had never moved it from earlier, and now their fingers were intertwined, still in Rio’s lap, dangerously close to where she needed it after the earlier fantasy. She let it be for the last few minutes of the movie. No sense in moving it now.
    </p>
<p>
     In the final scene, Agatha returns to the place where their characters first met, only to find Wanda there. They kiss. The title song, sung by Agatha, plays, and the credits roll.
    </p>
<p>
     A psychological thriller about Agatha hunting Wanda, her fucking serial killer wife, had Rio both in tears and ready to throw caution to the wind.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let go of Agatha’s hand abruptly and immediately missed the connection. She stood and hugged her as the theater erupted in applause. As she stepped back, she looked at Agatha in awe.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are amazing,” Rio said, regarding her in all of her award-winning megastar glory.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had received the highest praise from some of Hollywood’s most legendary icons. Yet it all paled in comparison to the look in Rio’s eyes right now. The sheer appreciation and admiration she saw. All she could do was smile back, anything else, and she might cry, or kiss her. Agatha had no idea why three simple words, a hug, and a look from one woman meant everything to her, but they did. If she never received another award, another positive word from the media or a movie critic, it wouldn’t matter. As long as Rio thought she was amazing, that’s all she needed.
    </p>
<p>
     “You two will absolutely get nominated!” Alice’s voice broke through the moment as she scooted down the row they were in to hug Agatha and Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda laughed. “For best kiss at the MTV Movie Awards, at least.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wouldn’t be the first time.” Agatha agreed.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     After more interviews and mingling, they finally climbed back into their vehicles to return to the compound.
    </p>
<p>
     “That was fun and exhausting at the same time.” Rio sighed, leaning against Agatha. She was tired and thrilled she had nowhere to be the next day.
    </p>
<p>
     “It usually is,” Agatha agreed as she instinctively put her arm around Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice looked over at Jen, raising an eyebrow and cutting her eyes to the two women. Jen silently took a picture and sent it to Wanda in the other car.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda checked her texts and almost screamed, solely from how Agatha looked at Rio. Nat just shook her head. “These lesbians are going to be the death of you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Vision smiled. “Funny, I’ve said that for twenty years.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nat and Wanda nearly choked.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had changed out of her dress and ridden back home with Alice, thankful for the decision to ride together. She was exhausted and knew she wouldn’t have been able to drive herself. She kept thinking about her feelings as she watched the movie. If she were to ever actually date Agatha, would she be able to get over the nudity in movies? Agatha kissing other people?
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice, am I a jealous person?” She asked honestly.
    </p>
<p>
     The laughter from Alice lasted a bit too long.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?” Alice calmed the laughter. “Feeling jealous?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blushed in stubborn silence.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you JEALOUS that other people see Agatha naked? Or are you jealous of Wanda?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A bit of both?” Rio spilled her thoughts, which had bothered her for hours.  “In the last relationship I was in, she was a model, and I wasn’t jealous. I wasn’t jealous when I found out she was still married, either. I was never jealous of people who had better lives or were famous or prettier. Yet, other people looking at Agatha? I know that’s not the first time she’s had a nude or sexual scene, and it’s not the last…And Wanda kissing and TOUCHING Agatha? I have zero claim to her, so why did I feel like this?” She asked Alice earnestly.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice pulled into her parking spot and turned off the car before regarding Rio. “You know the answer just as well as I do, but you continue to lie to yourself. I know you’re afraid, and rightly so. That bitch back in San Francisco screwed you up. But, If you ever do decide to date Agatha though, you’re going to have to deal with these feelings and more movies and scenes like what you witnessed tonight. You have to ask yourself if you can handle it, and if it’s worth it.”
    </p>
<p>
     With that, Alice got out of the vehicle, and Rio followed. They went up to their apartments quietly, Rio lost in her thoughts. Could she handle more of this? She honestly wasn’t sure. She had been so caught up in her rule, that she hadn’t thought of what dating THE Agatha Fucking Harkness would entail.
    </p>
<p>
     She hugged Alice before entering her apartment and being greeted by one pissed-off Raven.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right, I was gone all day, and for some reason, you require food,” She said as she walked to the kitchen. “Don’t you know how to do this yourself by now?” She looked at Raven, who waited rather impatiently. “You know, you’re lucky. You have me and whoever I bring home. You don’t have to worry about the complexity of relationships or work. You don’t have to worry about getting jealous about your close friend, who you might be extremely attracted to, having fake sex with your other close friend, who also happens to be gay, but not gay for your crush.” She set Raven’s food down and cleaned up a few things around the kitchen, watering plants before bed. “You also don’t have to worry about what would happen if you ever DID date her. How would you handle dating said friend?” She finished her chores, turned off lights, and took care of a few things as she walked towards her room. Raven trailed behind her. “Do I want people to know who I am? Just being on Agatha’s arm tonight was anxiety-inducing. I’m afraid to look at my phone right now. Who knows what pictures have been posted and what’s been said?” She changed into her pajamas as Raven curled up on her side of the bed. “Not to mention, what would you do? You would lose your side of the bed.” Raven looked at Rio and meowed at that. Raven did not share well and whenever someone was in bed with Rio, Raven took personal offense.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just sighed. “No. I’m getting ahead of myself. It will never happen, only in my dreams and fantasies.” She climbed into bed, finally looking at her phone, which was full of notifications. “See, Raven. I told you, might as well take a look.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She tapped on some of the stories to see the pictures and headlines.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Death’s Beloved Bound to be A Box Office Hit”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Harkness and Maximoff Deliver Oscar-Winning Performances in New Film”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The first several headlines were movie-focused and she was relieved. Then she saw the tweets, skeets, and pictures that focused on the two leading ladies themselves.
    </p>
<p>
     “Breaking tradition, the two leading ladies co-starred but brought separate dates instead of going together.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a wild Vision sighting! Wonder if it’s PR? So many pictures with her ‘bodyguard’ lately…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who is the mystery brunette on Agatha Harkness’s arm?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Did Agatha bring one of her throwaways to a premiere? That’s a first.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Both Wanda and Vision look like they’re out with their best friend, not love..”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, did Wagatha break up? Is this the end?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’s the bodyguard? Wanda getting with her is on my 2025 Bingo Card.”
    </p>
<p>
     “HOLY SHIT! IS THAT LORNA WU’S DAUGHTER BACK THERE?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The comments continued, and some of them were just downright mean, especially about Rio being there with Agatha. Her reading was interrupted.

</p>
<p>
     Rio just grinned at the Mother comment. She knew it had multiple meanings, and she meant it in a few ways. She sighed as she set her music up, saved some of the pictures she had seen posted, and settled in. Some of the comments stuck with her though.
    </p>
<p>
     “That woman is definitely not with Agatha. Agatha is out of her league.”
    </p>
<p>
     That was true. Rio wasn’t even in the same stratosphere as Agatha. As it was, she had zero idea what to pack this weekend. She had never considered what to wear around Agatha in the real world. Rio was always herself, but now she was very aware that she would be in public around her. Very public.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha doesn’t do relationships. Whoever she is, she isn’t permanent.” Another comment, another trueism. Agatha didn’t do permanent. How long would Rio be around if they did date? It was better to remain friends.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Yet, there was another post that really stuck with her. It was a picture of them looking at each other. Rio remembered the moment: Agatha had answered something, and their eyes caught one another’s, and they both just softened. Rio had saved the picture because of the way they were looking at each other, and someone else had noticed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve been a fan of Agatha Harkness since she was a kid,” the post said “and I’ve never seen her look at anyone like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     It actually scared Rio a bit, but she saved it too. She couldn’t quite put her finger on it, but something was there. They looked at each other as if no one else in the world mattered. It was as if, at that moment, time had stopped, and a declaration was being made that had knocked the wind from both of them. Rio had to think. What question had Agatha been asked? Something about the theme, maybe? The meaning? What her character was thinking? Then Rio remembered.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Agatha, your character is faced with this decision. What was going through her, and your, head to really show the love she had for her wife?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha smiled. “Without giving too much away, these two have this history and are just so good for each other.” Agatha’s eyes met Rio’s, as if speaking directly to her.  So, no matter what happens or what deep dark secrets they harbor, my character, Ann, knows that her wife will always be the person she wants. That there is nothing that will stand in the way of that.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio let out a breath she hadn’t known she was holding. Okay, so that was certainly a declaration. Was Agatha actually speaking to her, though? They hadn’t known each other when she had filmed that scene, so surely it was just a coincidence. Rio needed to go to sleep. She was reading too far into things. She was not Megastar girlfriend material. She was best friend material.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Rio woke up to Wanda Maximoff throwing clothes on her bed. “It’s past noon, and we have to get you packed. Wake up, sleepyhead.” She said as she found Rio’s half-packed suitcase.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled over, pulling the blankets over her head. She was having extremely pleasant dreams about a certain blue-eyed actress. “How the hell did you get in here?” she grumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, Ri. I let her in.” Alice apologized from the other room. “I also fed Raven. She was starving.” She added.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t believe her lies. She woke me up at five and made me feed her.” Rio got out of bed, made it, and got dressed in her bathroom. “What is all this anyway?” She called as she pulled her shirt over her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “You leave for New York tomorrow, well, tonight really, and Jen sent me to make sure you are dressed appropriately,” Wanda called back as she rifled through Rio’s suitcase. Alice just watched with amusement.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know how to pack for colder weather, Wanda,” Rio emerged from the bathroom in yoga pants and a t-shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I mean that,” She waved her hand at Rio’s current outfit. “The two of you will be alone, but in public a lot. Security will be around but at a distance. Wear something else when you’re around her. Plus, you’ll be going out Friday night, so bring something other than jeans and a T-shirt, Rio! You are gorgeous! Show it off! You can wear a coat when you’re outside.” Wanda was smiling, wickedly.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s what the clothes are for? To make sure I’m wearing coven-approved clothing that puts a spin on things?” Rio asked skeptically.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda nodded after removing most things from Rio’s suitcase. At least her lacy, coordinating underwear had made the cut. Rio had that going for her. “Why couldn’t we just go shopping?” Rio looked at the large stack of clothing and several shopping bags.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda shook her head, “No time, I sent Alice and Jen to do it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a weekend, Wanda, not a month. This is entirely too much,” Rio was getting overwhelmed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I agree,” Wanda had started holding clothes up to Rio, Alice trying hard not to laugh from her spot on the bed. “If I had my way, you’d spend the majority of the weekend wearing mostly nothing, but both of you are idiots and won’t make a move.” She sighed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you for your concern about my love and sex life,” Rio grabbed a short red dress from Wanda, if you could call it that, and went to try it on.
    </p>
<p>
     “We just want the best for both of you,” Alice called out behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda nodded as they waited for Rio to come out. “You treat her like a regular person, and that is so important. You went from starstruck to ‘this is just Agatha’ in record time. You could handle the fame. You meet her at her most sarcastic. Alice and I are so protective of the two of you, and we agree that we would allow this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I still get starstruck,” Rio replied.  Last night was the first time I truly saw her in her element. Thanks for the blessing to date your daughter there Mr. Harkness.” She smirked as she came out of the bathroom. Wanda and Alice just stared.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel herself blushing. “What? Does it look bad?”
    </p>
<p>
     The dress was bold. It was short. It was revealing. And Rio was proud of herself for getting into it without help. It was classic apple red, one strap holding it up on her right shoulder that went diagonally across her chest. While the dress completely covered her left side, on the right side, her breast was covered, but there was a cutout that went up to the bottom of her sternum, showing off most of her ribcage. Much of her back was exposed, except where the fabric from the right went around as if it was a strapless bra and connected to the left, where the shoulder strap also came down, diagonally, and connected. It was mid-thigh length, hugged every curve just right, and showed off every muscle. Rio liked to stay in shape, and in this dress, it showed.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda shook her head vigorously.
    </p>
<p>
     “Holy shit. You’re fucking hot, Rio. Wear that Friday night. You might have a hard time dancing, nope, that’s perfect for dancing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice nodded. “Agatha will love it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hadn’t even really looked at herself. “You’re both exaggerating,” She went back to the bathroom to look at herself. “Fuck. I’d fuck me in a heartbeat.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda threw herself back on the bed. “That’s the point!!”
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was suddenly more excited than she had been before.
    </p>
<p>
</p>

<p>
     Agatha had finished her packing, knowing they would be seen around the city. They had spent most of their friendship in private places or school functions, and now they would be in public spaces. Pictures were bound to be taken, there would be speculation, and Jen would be working her ass off from LA. Jen was the Tree to her Taylor, and Agatha would forever be in her debt.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Her suitcase was ready by the door since they were leaving the house around one a.m. and would meet the private jet on the tarmac. It was roughly a six-and-a-half-hour flight to New York and a three-hour time difference. They would get there by early afternoon, she would run through a few things at the studio, and they would go to dinner and then out. Wanda had gone through Agatha’s suitcase and approved what she had packed, as well as added a few things. She replaced some old pajamas with much shorter ones, though. Agatha allowed it. She had older ones in the Manhattan apartment. She’d wear them and send Wanda a picture.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had seen the comments and pictures posted online, and Jen had already posted statements and scrubbed a few unsavory things for both of the starlets. Things that speculated about Wanda and Vision, information that had leaked about Rio, the standard fare. She would never trade this life, but there were parts of it that she could do without. For one, the hateful articles about the movie were a part she hated. She loved some of the comments from her fans, though.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is 2024, another year of our Lord and Savior Agatha Harkness, and there is STILL homophobia? HOW?!”
    </p>
<p>
     “The entire country rallied around this woman in 1989. She propelled the entire community, yet there are still pockets of these people? It’s been 35 years!”
    </p>
<p>
     “This just in: the movie is amazing, and no one cares about your hate.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The true tragedy is how she’s clearly in love with that woman. Is Agatha about to be off the market for good? I mean, My chances weren’t AMAZING, but now they’re zero.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did a double take. She was absolutely NOT in love. At all. Strong like, maybe. Definitely lust. So much lust. She loved Rio like a friend, but she was not
     <em>
      in
     </em>
     love with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She clicked on her hashtag to read more comments, just for fun.
    </p>
<p>
     “That poor woman doesn’t know what’s coming.”
    </p>
<p>
     “IS WAGATHA OVER? I AM A CHILD OF DIVORCE!”
    </p>
<p>
     “HOW DO YOU GET AN INVITE FROM AGATHA?!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Could you imagine having to handle all of the fame that goes with just DATING Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “RIP WAGATHA!”
    </p>
<p>
     “So, Mother broke up with Wanda and went and found a child to date?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Imagine going to a movie premiere with Agatha and then watching her have sex with Wanda Maximoff.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know her, she’s a teacher!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not Agatha being hot for teacher.”
    </p>
<p>
     “LORNA WU’S DAUGHTER IS THERE!”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha would have to make sure Jen kept an eye out for information about Rio leaking. She would also need to talk to Rio and ask her what she wanted Agatha to post on her official social media pages.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked up from her phone as Wanda walked in. They had apps on their phones to disarm the alarm systems, as well as keys, to each other’s houses. Jen and Alice also had that power, and recently, she’d given Rio that access. She trusted her. It’s what friends did.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is Rio coming here tonight, or are you picking her up?” Wanda asked as she went straight to the kitchen to refill her water cup.
    </p>
<p>
     “Picking her up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Change it. Have her come here. It’ll be easier.” Wanda walked into the living room and flopped down next to Wanda, traces of cat hair on her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed, noticing the feline evidence, “You just packed for her and want to make sure she doesn’t unpack everything,” she stated with a knowing look.
    </p>
<p>
     “Damn that amazing cat and her hair.” Wanda looked down at herself, knowing she’d been caught red-handed because of Raven.
    </p>
<p>
     “I would rather have her over anyway,” Agatha muttered, seeing Wanda’s sly grin. “Whatever, where’s your wife?” Agatha continued.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shot Rio a text asking her if she wanted to come over, eat dinner, and leave from there instead. Rio replied instantly with yes and that she’d be there at seven. It was currently five-thirty.
    </p>
<p>
     “We are not married. We’re not even technically dating,” Wanda rolled her eyes. “The boys wanted to go to some college sports thing this afternoon with Vision, and she went with them as extra security. Did you not know? Your OWN SON went.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I knew he was going. I just didn’t know Nat was going with them instead of spending the time with you. She usually spends all possible moments with you. Trouble in paradise?” Agatha asked, looking at Wanda seriously.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda just smiled. “No. Truthfully? I asked her to go. After seeing some…comments, online today, she needed to be seen protecting someone that wasn’t me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a warm look. “Oh honey, I’m sorry you saw those. I’m trying to get all the nastiness taken down,” Wanda nodded as tears started to form. Agatha held her arms open, and Wanda buried them into her like she had done hundreds of times over the years. Agatha soothed her, smoothing her hair down, ever the protective big sister. “Hey, it’s just speculation right now. Almost all of the comments were positive. We still have so much time to prepare for everything, okay? We’re able to get ahead, and we’re going to tackle it all head-on. All of us, okay? This family that you and I built, starting with you seducing Nat out of killing us, we’re going to do everything we can, and we’ll protect each other.” She kissed Wanda on top of her head in comfort.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda shifted so her head was leaning on Agatha’s shoulder, legs over her lap, arms wrapped around her waist. Agatha had her feet propped on the table in front of them, and both arms around Wanda’s shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know we will. I’m just worried about the boys and what people will say at school, or what if Nat decides she doesn’t want this?” Wanda’s lip quivered as she worried out loud.
    </p>
<p>
     If not for the seriousness of Wanda’s tone, Agatha would have laughed. “Natasha Romanov has been in love with you for 25 years. She has handled every single thing that has come your way with poise, grace, and, at times, violence if needed. You two found ways to be together in your own way, and now you truly get to be together again. I have never seen a love as pure as the one between you. That woman would marry you the second the divorce was finalized, and Vision would hand you the rings. You think he didn’t know? He absolutely did. As for the boys? No one will say a thing, and if they did? Between Lilia, Rio, Alice, and Nicky? They’ll be fine. Don’t let other people get into your head and try to ruin your happiness, angel. I will always defend you, and you know it. I will burn my whole life down to protect our family, and don’t you forget it.” Agatha squeezed Wanda’s shoulders as a few tears of her own fell. She had always been protective of Wanda and tried to shield her from all negativity, speculation, and anything she could. Wanda had had enough trauma in her life before she had even come to America, she didn’t need more of it, and Agatha had spent nearly 30 years trying to keep it that way.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda nodded and pulled away so she could look at Agatha. “I went to Rio that night. The night you and Nat were in New York? You trust her so much, so I knew I could too. We, Vision and I, were helping the boys with homework, and for a moment, I, I don’t know, hallucinated?. That Vision was actually Nat. I nearly lost it. So I texted Rio, and when homework was over, I went to her place. We got drunk, and I told her everything. She was the one that gave me the final push I needed. I told her not to tell you, to let me be the one to tell you that I went to her instead of you.” Wanda confessed, chewing on her lip.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled softly. “I knew. She didn’t tell me. I just knew. I also noticed the two of you have been closer since then, and it means a lot to me. I’m glad it was her, and I’m just happy you finally did it. Now, stop worrying. Nat will be home soon, and the two of you can go spend the night together. Forget the speculation from a tiny, tiny portion of fans. The majority still think Vision just doesn’t like the spotlight or that you and I are dating. Though now a lot think we might have broken up.” Agatha looked up as she heard the door open.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio walked in and saw tears drying. “What happened?” She asked, concern in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, nothing, sweetie. Wanda just had a moment, everything got sentimental, and emotions happened.” Agatha answered, not noticing the nickname she had used.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda’s eyebrows shot up as she looked between the two of them. Rio also raised an eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, okay,
     <em>
      darling
     </em>
     . Glad that happened before we left. I put my suitcase next to yours.”
    </p>
<p>
     She sat down next to Agatha as Wanda moved over. “I hate the people of the internet, by the way.” She was completely ignoring the ‘sweetie’ of it all.
    </p>
<p>
     The other women just nodded. Wanda grinned broadly, while Agatha ignored the ‘darling’ of it all.
    </p>
<p>

<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had flown before, but never on a private jet. Let alone a movie star’s private jet. Alice was taking care of Raven for the weekend, Rio had everything prepared to go back to school for the next week, and she had made sure that the only thing she had to focus on this weekend was New York and Agatha. She still wasn’t exactly sure how she had gotten here, but she was here. Agatha was now one of her closest friends, even if they were attracted to each other. They were clinging to stupid rules for reasons that held merit, apparently. Despite that, all the lines were blurred, and all the streams were crossed.
    </p>
<p>
     She was both confused and thinking clearly.
    </p>
<p>
     When she got to Agatha’s, the plan had been to get a few hours of sleep. Instead, the three of them talked until Nat got back, and Wanda attacked Nat with kisses. Absolutely planned by Wanda, Rio was sure of it. Once red-headed demons one and two had left, Rio and Agatha continued talking about New York until they headed to the airport, which was an experience just to be driven up to the plane.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, Rio sat in what felt more like an actual recliner on the plane that turned into more of a bed. Thankfully, this one was a double seat, and the arm came up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I sit next to you?” Agatha asked once they were in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, I was slightly offended when you didn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha got up and moved over, sitting next to Rio, not bothering to separate them with the armrest. “Don’t laugh,” She paused, waiting for Rio’s response.
    </p>
<p>
     “I won’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “After all these years of flying all over the world, I still get airsick. I get seasick, too. I’m surprised I don’t get carsick. So I sit by myself on take-off and landing just in case. Usually, it’s just the feeling, nothing else. I just don’t trust it.” She searched Rio’s face for any judgment, laughter, any negativity at all. She knew it was slightly ridiculous as she had been flying almost her entire life.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just looked back with empathy. “In middle school, I got sick on the bus on a field trip. It was awful. I absolutely get it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “THAT wasn’t your most embarrassing moment?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You asked about high school, not middle school. Once in college, I got so drunk at a party and threw up all over this girl I was dating. She completely freaked out and broke up with me, said she couldn’t handle anyone that vomited,” Rio laughed at the memory. “Turns out I had been sick. She didn’t care. Puking was a red flag, apparently.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head as she laughed. “If someone I cared about got sick, no matter what the cause, I would just take care of them because that’s what you do when you care about someone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha Harkness, award-winning megastar, one of the most famous women in the world, the best mother ever, Hollywood’s bad-boy and womanizer, which I have found not to be true, activist, looks great in everything, the best friend anyone could have, protector of all, also has a heart of gold and cleans up puke. Who would have thought?” She was looking at Agatha with awe by the time she was done with her list. For years, she had idolized and fantasized about this woman, and now, Agatha was one of her best friends. She was Nicky’s teacher, and she so badly wished Nicky could transfer to another teacher, but no one else taught her subjects.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew she needed to confide in Rio. She still didn’t know when the perfect time would be. Here she was, staring into those beautiful brown eyes that she could get lost in, breathing in the eucalyptus scent, wanting so badly to close the distance between them. However, she knew they had to lay everything out before that happened.
     <em>
      Coward.
     </em>
     Instead, she just sighed. “We should probably try and get some sleep. Want to sleep with me on an airplane?” She gave Rio a comically exaggerated wink.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio giggled in the way only Agatha could make her do, which elicited a snort of laughter from Agatha. She was exhausted, and they had another four hours to go. They both needed some semblance of sleep as she yawned after her giggle fit and nodded. She reclined her seat as Agatha did the same while handing her a blanket. Rio wasn’t ready to tell Agatha everything, but she was done pretending like she didn’t want to melt into her when they slept, and the crew and security aboard the plane had all signed ironclad NDAs and most likely been threatened by Nat. She lay on her side, curled up against Agatha, head on her shoulder, arm over her stomach, leg over hers. Rio positioned herself before she could overthink it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stiffened at first when Rio had assumed her position and then relaxed once she settled. No wonder their friends were teasing them so much lately. She wrapped her arms around Rio and scooted a bit closer. Agatha knew that in their sleep they tended to end up intertwined, but deliberately falling asleep like this? She could get used to it. She wanted to get used to it.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s alarm went off a few hours later. They were roughly an hour away from landing. It was about eight-thirty California time but eleven-thirty New York time. She knew Rio’s body was going to be thrown off. Agatha was used to this.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised her head, “Are we there yet?” She looked around, blinking.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not yet, kid. We have about an hour,” She raised their seats. “Are you hungry?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio yawned and stretched as she was forced into a seated position. “Maybe a granola bar? Something light. I’m going to change first, though,” She got up and grabbed the backpack she had brought on board, her suitcase in the cargo area, and walked to the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched her go. The longer they were friends, the more she noticed, and the harder it was to hide her feelings. “You’re an actress, Harkness, fake it,” she muttered to herself.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha loved New York, and she was excited to have Rio by her side. She had to run by the studio first, though it wouldn’t take long, and Rio had insisted on going with her. Rio felt weird going to Agatha’s apartment without her and didn’t mind spending time around actors she admired.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They walked onto the set, and Agatha hugged some of her friends and people they knew, introducing Rio to everyone. Rio smiled as several people gave Agatha knowing smiles as she had talked about Rio just a bit earlier in the week. A few former castmates were guest-starring this week as well, Kate McKinnon being one of Rio’s favorites.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat in a room backstage, scrolling on her phone as Agatha quickly ran through a few skits. Rehearsal would last most of the day tomorrow, but some things had changed, and they wanted to go over some things a few extra times today. Rio heard footsteps and looked up to see two of the cast members, Heidi and Chloe, coming towards her. Riosmiled before greeting them. “I hate to sound like a total fangirl, but Heidi, I love you in What We Do in the Shadows, and your annoying coworker Crystal’s character is spot on. Chloe, your impressions are fantastic, and the skit with Wanda a few weeks ago where the two of you made fun of the whole Wagatha thing was hilarious. I can’t believe you didn’t break.” She said, her eyes going between both of them.
    </p>
<p>
     They both smiled and thanked her.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you must be Rio. Agatha talks a lot about you,” Chloe looked at her, “are you two dating?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head and did her best to laugh. “No, we’re close friends. We’re not dating.”
    </p>
<p>
     Heidi nodded and glanced at Chloe knowingly. “Agatha mentioned she was taking you out tonight, and she always goes to the same place, so maybe we’ll see you. Bye!” She waved as they left. Rio raised an eyebrow as she watched them leave. Agatha came up beside her not a minute later.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you ready to go?” Agatha asked. She had seen and heard the entire exchange.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded as Agatha led the way. Still slightly confused. Where did Agatha always go?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The Manhattan apartment was huge. Wagatha had converted the entire top floor of the building into one large residence.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is my room,” Agatha said, walking into one of the largest master suites Rio had ever seen. There was a black four-post California king bed with purple bedding and more pillows than she could count. All of the furniture was solid black wood, and dark hardwood floors continued through the entire home. Rio noticed a private balcony through sliding glass doors and a huge en-suite. Double doors led to a closet that she was sure was the size of her bedroom at home.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can share with me or take the room across the hall.” She added softly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought about it. They had to keep at least a dotted line of a boundary, though. “I’ll take the room across the hall, but I’m still sharing a bed with you, Harkness. You know, tradition at this point.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right,” Agatha said with a smirk, “Tradition.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They had both taken to their separate bedrooms to shower and get dressed for the evening. Rio was double-checking everything. She had chosen black high-heeled ankle boots and a black clutch to go with the red dress. Her hair was down in loose waves, with a smokey eye and a dark red lipstick. Small, simple silver hoops completed the look. She took a deep breath and looked at herself in the mirror. “Alright, Rio Fucking Vidal. Go for it.”
    </p>
<p>
     She walked into the main room of the home, her heels clacking on the hardwood, and for the second time that week, was blown away by Agatha Harkness. Agatha was wearing a black and white corset top that buttoned in the front with black tapered pants that were perfectly tailored to her, and black heels. Her hair was somehow tamed and pulled back into a low ponytail. Rio wanted to undo each button personally. Her make-up was light, and she just oozed
     <em>
      Agatha Fucking Harkness, Queen of Fucking Everything.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha heard Rio walk in as she texted Nicky to check on him. She raised her eyes and almost dropped her phone. She put it away as she gathered her composure and her ability to function for the second time that week. Rio was gorgeous, but in this outfit, her natural beauty and sexiness were brought out and on display. She exuded confidence, and Agatha wanted to push her up against the wall and test out how kiss-proof the lipstick was. She would have to remember to thank Wanda. She had a feeling this dress was her doing.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I don’t know if I’ve told you this recently, but you are gorgeous,” Agatha said softly, eyes locked on Rio’s. Part of her really wanted to say ‘That dress looks amazing, it would look even better on the floor of my bedroom’, but she was trying not to be
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     woman anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blushed but didn’t break the eye contact. “You have said something to that effect, but I like hearing it. Especially from you.” She broke the contact long enough to look her up and down, making it obvious she was checking her out. “You are beautiful yourself, Harkness,” She got right next to Agatha and said softly in her ear, “Sexiest woman alive.” Before gently brushing past her and grabbing her black peacoat. “Ready to go, m’lady?” Rio had a plan. They would go out, come back, and as they lay in bed, Rio would tell her everything. Hopefully, Agatha would share, and they would make their decision. She was tired of going back and forth, tired of walking around it. It was time to lay everything out on the table and decide if they could do this.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath had hitched in her throat when Rio called her the sexiest woman alive. It was a title she had received before. Plenty of women had called her sexy. However, hearing it from Rio was different. It held more meaning. She turned and grabbed the jacket for her outfit and her clutch, following Rio. Agatha was hoping that tonight would be the night that they talked, laid it all out, and realized they could do this. She wanted Rio more than she had wanted anyone or anything else in her life. At the premiere on Wednesday, Agatha watched that scene imagining that Wanda was Rio. It had been quite the fantasy, but she wanted the real thing. Not this weekend, necessarily, but soon. She just so desperately wanted to finally kiss Rio and find out if it was all fireworks, stars, kittens, and rainbows like she thought it would be.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha took Rio to one of her favorite places for dinner, ensuring they had a private area. Jen had previously set it up for them, though it was known she was in town since she was hosting SNL this weekend, so paparazzi pictures had been taken. Agatha had taken a moment in between courses to ask Rio what she wanted her to post on the official socials. “Since you went to a premiere with me and you’re being seen with me here, there’s going to be speculation. I like to address things on my socials so I can control the narrative. What would you like me to say?” She asked, trying to pry into Rio’s thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew what Agatha was doing, and she refused to show her hand. “We can wait a few days to see if it settles down first? After that, maybe post that we’re just close friends?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Perfect.”
     <em>
      Or we can talk this weekend, and I can tell them we’re dating.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     They ate while Agatha told Rio about New York and different things about SNL, making Rio laugh with different stories. When they finished, she propped her chin on her hand and looked over at Rio, “We have two options. We can go back home, or we go to an invite-only lesbian club that’s owned by a celebrity friend of mine. Your choice,”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought about it for a moment. She was so nervous about talking, and while they had each had a martini with dinner, it wouldn’t hurt to go dancing and drinking to help loosen up their nerves.
    </p>
<p>
     “Take me dancing!” She said with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was a tad disappointed but also excited to take her out. They had all night and tomorrow night, plus the flight back. The night was still young and showing her off would be fun.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The club had a strict ‘no phone, no pictures’ rule, which had probably saved Agatha a lot of bad publicity over the years. The music was loud, and there were many high-profile women. Rio took it all in while she could before Agatha was swarmed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had forgotten exactly why she was so popular here.
    </p>
<p>
     Because up until Agatha met Rio, Agatha fucked. A lot.
     <em>
      Shit.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio just watched as women were all over Agatha. Famous women, high profile women, random women.
    </p>
<p>
     “We told you she comes to the same place.” A familiar voice said in Rio’s ear as another woman handed Rio a shot. She looked over to see Chloe and Heidi. Rio nodded. “I didn’t know what you meant at the time. Cheers,” she said, raising the shot and then downing it.
    </p>
<p>
     “We need more of these,” Chloe said as she disappeared.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was trying to escape the attention while being polite. Three shots later and a drink in hand, she got to Rio. “I am so sorry!” She said joining Rio and her two companions.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio masked her jealousy well, smiling at Agatha.  “No problem! I’ve been drinking a bit,” She gestured to a table holding a few shot glasses, drink in hand. “Looks like people missed you. Who’s the drink from?” She asked, feigning innocence.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “A singer.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s nice.”
    </p>
<p>
     They were interrupted by someone asking Agatha to dance. Some actress from a TV show that Rio didn’t really watch. Agatha turned towards Rio to say something.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t believe that Agatha was going to ask her for permission to dance with someone else when Rio was so close to finally confessing her feelings to Agatha. She just nodded and waved her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was shocked Rio was telling her to go off with someone else! She was about to tell this woman that she couldn’t dance with her, and Rio was drinking and acting like it was no big deal. Two could play this game. She pointed to a VIP booth to the side to let Rio know she’d meet her there, downed her drink and set it on the table, grabbed the other actress's hand, and stormed off.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had other plans. She told Heidi to get more shots and showed her where to take them, took Chloe by the wrist, and led her out to where they were close enough to Agatha and whoever the fuck, to clearly be seen by her. Chloe laughed and leaned close to Rio’s ear so she could be heard, “Are we playing the ‘make my just-a-friend’ jealous game?” she asked. Rio made a guilty face, and Chloe nodded with a grin. “Permission to play along?” Rio nodded. Maybe it was the alcohol, but she automatically trusted her and knew that if anyone could make this look semi-believable, it was Chloe.
    </p>
<p>
     Chloe leaned in close to her ear. “That dress looks amazing on you and Agatha is extremely lucky.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blushed and lightly smacked her arm, “Chloe! Stop! You’re making me blush!” She laughed, Chloe was quickly becoming a friend, and she recognized the flirting was deliberate and innocent.
    </p>
<p>
     Chloe quickly glanced at Agatha, who was shooting daggers at her before dancing even closer to Rio and leaning in again, “We have her attention. Try to keep eye contact with her, glare, give her fuck-me eyes, whatever. Just make sure she knows that you wanted me to be here later so she doesn’t murder me, okay?” Chloe instructed before she spun Rio around by the hips, pressed their bodies together, and guided their dancing. Rio followed and let her lead. She found Agatha, who was running her hands through her hair and glaring at Rio as she was doing some type of hip thrust against a supermodel half her age. Rio was young, but not that young. Agatha looked directly at Rio, fire in her eyes, and bit her lip. Rio saw that Agatha was also here to play, and Rio was finding that a jealous Agatha was doing things to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did not get jealous. She had everything she wanted in life. Until now. Now, there was one untouchable person because neither of them could use their words like adults. Instead, here they were, grinding on other women like teenagers, giving each other bedroom eyes across a crowded dance floor to highly suggestive music. She hoped Chloe was acting right now because her hands on Rio’s bare skin went past friendly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ran her tongue over her bottom lip as she put her hand on top of Chloe’s and guided it down her thigh, eyes screaming, ‘this should be you.’
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could feel the heat low in her abdomen, but she could also feel the tightening in her chest. She had no right to Rio. They weren’t dating. They hadn’t even confessed feelings for each other. Yet at this moment, Agatha wanted to part the sea of bodies, rip her out of Chloe’s arms, pull Rio against her, and kiss her in a way that made it very clear to everyone that Rio was off limits. Agatha was not territorial or possessive, but Rio just brought out something primal in her. Agatha was also too competitive for this.  She was going to double down. She could own Rio from afar. It was then that Andie, her friend and club owner, walked by. She caught her arm and slid behind her. She leaned in and spoke in her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     “Making someone jealous, play along.”
    </p>
<p>
     Andie understood the assignment as she turned around and pressed herself against Agatha. What Rio couldn’t see was that Andie was laughing the entire time.
    </p>
<p>
     Who is that, now? Rio thought. Agatha hadn’t had to do much but whisper in someone’s ear, and now another gorgeous celebrity was already rubbing herself against Agatha. Rio gave up, she couldn’t outact an Oscar winner or apparently, out seduce her. Plus,  the longer she saw Agatha grind on that blonde in a way that was borderline sex, she wanted to scream. Rio tapped Chloe’s wrist as she turned around. “Drinks,” she demanded as she led her towards the table. Heidi raised an eyebrow, seeing them return.
    </p>
<p>
     “Trying to make Agatha jealous?” She asked, drinking water.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took two shots. “How did you know?”
    </p>
<p>
     Heidi looked at Chloe and then back to Rio. “The way she’s talked about you this week, and the way you two look at each other. You like her and she likes you. I’m surprised she brought you here. What a bad idea for someone she genuinely likes. Maybe this is her trying?”
    </p>
<p>
     Chloe nodded. “We don’t know her super well, and the woman has a reputation. We see her here a lot.” She added that last bit in a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was already well into drunken territory, and her common sense failed her as she took two more shots. This wasn’t what she had wanted from the night, and she doubted her ability to handle any of this. Rio was racing towards blackout drunk when Agatha joined them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Having fun?” Agatha asked as Rio stumbled into her. “How much have you had to drink?” She looked at her, startled concern etched into her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not sure,” Rio replied, straightening up. Everything she had eaten at dinner was alcohol-soaked, and she felt like the excess was going straight to her head.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn’t sober, far from it, but she was nowhere near where Rio now. Agatha had been drinking since she was a child and could drink just about anyone under the table. She took one of the remaining shots from the table before turning to Rio. “Are you too drunk to dance?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s heart raced and she went pale as she shook her head so hard she almost fell over. Agatha put her hand on Rio’s waist to steady her. This was what Rio had been waiting for, and she was drunk.
     <em>
      Good job.
     </em>
     She downed another drink, for courage, and let Agatha lead her back to the floor just as a remix of
     <em>
      “Red Wine Supernova”
     </em>
     came on. Rio smiled and looked down, her face already flushed from the alcohol, still gained an added blush.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha asked in her ear as they moved to the music.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just, this fucking song.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fitting?” Agatha asked with her signature smirk. Fuck being subtle. It’s not like they were good at it anymore and the alcohol was not helping.
    </p>
<p>
     “Perfectly,” Rio replied with a smirk of her own as she tried to give Agatha a smoldering look, but realized she was extremely drunk as she rolled her hips into Agatha’s at the “want me to fuck you?” line.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes went dark with need. They needed to have that talk, and now. Not in some club, not in the car with people listening, but at home. She gripped Rio’s wrist and pulled her towards the door. She caught Heidi’s gaze and waved. Agatha knew her tab would be automatically closed, and she’d shoot a text to Andie later.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let Agatha lead her out of the club. Hell, she’d let Agatha lead her into the woods and drain her of her life force. She didn’t care. Rio was drunk and she needed Agatha in more ways than one. They needed to get back to the apartment and talk. Rio couldn’t remember the words which she had practiced in her head so many times,  but knew it would come to her. As the car door shut behind them, Agatha handed Rio a bottle of water. “I need you to dilute some of that alcohol. I’m drunk, but you’re blitzed.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio downed the water, knowing whatever it was they were about to do required more than half of a functioning brain cell. She stared at Agatha. She was so pretty, and famous, and perfect. How had Rio gotten to this point in her life? She was about to do something, she wasn’t entirely sure what, with Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha drank her water slowly. She was careful not to move Rio too roughly or push her too hard. She was worried about her. How many drinks did Rio have when I wasn’t looking?  Her answer was apparent as Rio looked a little green around the edges. Agatha needed her to hold out till they could at least talk. Maybe just finally kiss? She wanted so much more, but  Agatha never took advantage of those situations. They made it home and up to the apartment, Rio leaning heavily against Agatha as they hung up their coats, tossing aside Rio’s heels that had come off in the car. Agatha sighed in relief. She hated wearing heels but liked the extra height. She turned Rio toward her, hands lightly on her waist. Rio brought her hands up and placed them on Agatha’s shoulders, looking at her, Rio’s brown eyes were bloodshot but full of emotions that Agatha couldn’t quite place.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha brought her hand up, tucking Rio’s hair behind her ear as Rio leaned into the touch, sighing as she stepped closer. Agatha leaned their foreheads together, it was intimate and they were so close,
     <em>
      not yet,
     </em>
     she told herself. “We need to talk,” she whispered, her lips almost touching Rio’s.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I…” Rio started. Suddenly, she pushed Agatha back, eyes full of alarm as she ran towards the nearest bathroom. Agatha sighed heavily as she followed her, hearing the undeniable sounds of too much partying coming back up.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha, true to what she had said no less than twenty-four hours earlier, pulled Rio’s hair back in a loose ponytail and placed a cool washcloth on her neck as she rubbed her back. Rio had definitely tried to hang with the professionals.
    </p>
<p>
     While Rio brushed her teeth in Agatha’s bathroom and cleaned up a bit, Agatha pulled out pajamas for her. A green tank top and short set with lace down the sides that she knew was Wanda’s doing. Rio came out of the bathroom with wobbly legs and looked at Agatha with big brown eyes. “Will you help me?” She asked in the most vulnerable tone Agatha had ever heard come from Rio’s lips. The dress was complicated and she couldn’t work it in her state.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded as she found the zipper on the side with the most fabric. She carefully unzipped it, still facing Rio. She was trying her best not to touch Rio’s skin. Rio wasn’t wearing a bra, and Agatha was painfully aware of that fact as she quickly turned around and faced away from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Rio’s voice trembled as Agatha heard the sound of fabric hitting the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes?” Agatha tried to keep her own voice steady and normal, though it came out a bit breathy.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can look. We’re grown adults,” Rio said, placing a hand on her shoulder, partly to stabilize herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was still facing the other direction. “Rio, you’re drunk. I’m not going to take advantage of you. Contrary to popular belief, I am not that kind of girl.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio removed her hand and sat on the bed so she wouldn’t fall over while she put her clothes on. Agatha was right. Rio was drunk, and she had lost her chance. “And they say chivalry is dead.” Rio joked, trying to mask her disappointment. Her head started to swim again. She really needed to stop drinking around Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s just the gays keeping it alive. I’m going to change. Get in bed,” she ordered as she grabbed a pile of clothes and walked to the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ooh. Yes, ma’am,” Rio tried to say seductively, but she was slurring her words again.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha just sighed. “So you don’t hurt yourself,” she added.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was thankful for the pajamas she had in her dresser. The ones in her suitcase were the same as Rio’s, except purple. She had rolled her eyes and smiled at Wanda’s cheekiness when she pulled them out. Tonight was not the night for those, though. She knew the lace would show off sideboob, and drunk McGee in there didn’t need that temptation. Instead, it was plaid flannel pajama pants and an old promo shirt from The Witches’ Road. She had also decided a bra was necessary.
    </p>
<p>
     “No temptations.” She told herself in the mirror, for me or her.
    </p>
<p>
     When she joined Rio in bed, her very inebriated companion was half asleep. Agatha lay on her side facing her, “How do you feel?” She asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “The room is spinning, and I think I might fall off the planet,” Rio said sleepily, eyes half open.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew now was not the time for sharing their deep, dark secrets. She didn’t blame Rio for what transpired tonight. It wasn’t her fault. They had engaged in a power struggle and completely lost the plot. Agatha knew she was afraid of opening up to Rio. She wanted to, but what if Rio wasn’t willing to accept the part of Agatha that didn’t know how to be loved and accepted for who she was? She had been rejected for being famous and kept a secret. So what if that was decades ago, even before she had Nicky. It had still turned her off from the whole serious relationship thing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was struggling to stay awake. She wanted to tell Agatha about San Francisco, about what’s her name, but she couldn’t form words. It probably wouldn’t have made sense anyway. She felt awful for drinking so much, but had she really been ready to open up? To be rejected? Would Agatha date her, knowing she potentially still had a crazed stalker out there somewhere? It was too much. Her eyelids were heavy, her brain hurt, and she needed to sleep. She slung her arm over Agatha’s middle and clumsily scooted closer to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Night Aggie. I’m sorry I fucked up,” she mumbled. Her eyes had closed, and her words were barely audible.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have nothing to apologize for. Good night, Ri,” Agatha didn’t always call her Ri, only sparingly since it felt so intimate. They were going on three months of friendship, and she realized they were more than friends at this point. Rio began to snore a few minutes later as only the drunkest do, and Agatha chuckled. She twisted a little to look at Rio’s face. She kissed her on the forehead and whispered, “you might be worth the risk.” She went to sleep as she thought about all of the pros and cons.
    </p>

    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Things were strangely awkward on Saturday. Neither woman acknowledged anything from the night before. Rio was clearly hungover and felt awful about how things had unfolded, choosing silence over apologies. Agatha was acting normal for the most part but acting like they hadn’t shared any intimate moments. The women had gotten dressed and had a quiet breakfast, making small talk about the day ahead of them before going to the SNL studio. There, Agatha rehearsed and got ready while Rio hung out with Chappell Roan’s girlfriend, of all people. It was quite the experience, and they got along swimmingly, helping the day fly by without forcing Rio to think about last night or confront it with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     It was roughly half an hour until show time, and Agatha hadn’t spoken to Rio most of the day. The show was about to begin, and she had no idea where Rio even was. Things had been awkward all day, and she hated it. Rio had barely said anything to her since breakfast. They had been so close last night, but she wasn’t entirely sure what had happened. Wanda had checked in earlier, and Agatha just told her they drank too much. She’d fill her in later.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was avoiding Agatha. That hadn’t been her intention when she woke up that morning, but it was now her tool of choice. She knew she’d have to face her after the show, but that was future Rio’s problem. Rio did want to wish Agatha luck though, and that was her current conflict. The good friend in her won, as she walked up to Agatha, who wore a flattering white suit for her monologue.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, break a leg tonight. You’re going to be amazing. You always are.” She said, walking up behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned around and smiled. NOW Rio was talking to her, and she didn’t sound mad or upset. A wave of relief washed over Agatha.  No matter what happened or was going on in that head of hers, Rio was still there to support her. Agatha hadn’t realized that it would mean so much to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” she responded.  What’d you do today? I didn’t see you around much.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio noticed the sadness in Agatha’s eyes as she said it, and she felt the pain in her own chest, knowing she had caused it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hung out with Chappell Roan and her girlfriend, talked to Chloe and Heidi when they weren’t busy, met Kate McKinnon and fan girl’d there, talked to Keenan, oh, and met Colin and Michael.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m glad you had a good day. The show’s about to start. See you in a bit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rushed off with a sweet smile on her face. Now that she had confirmation Rio was done avoiding her, she wanted to get back in the right headspace to host a live show.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s face told Rio everything she needed. Not only had Rio ruined last night, but she hurt the one woman she truly cared about today. I need to fix it when we get back to Agatha’s later, she thought. For now, she took her reserved spot in the audience and got ready to watch the great Agatha Harkness dazzle everyone. Rio had watched Agatha countless times on screens, but seeing her live was an altogether different experience. It almost canceled out her awkward and negative feelings from the night before. Before she knew it, the show was over and Rio was determined to make up for last night.
    </p>
<p>
     The show ended, and Agatha found Rio quickly. She needed to know why she had been avoiding her all day, but not here. But, just in case, Agatha was going to give her an out: “Some people are going to go…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cut her off. “No. We’re going to your place.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded, relieved that Rio had chosen to return with her instead.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They had changed into pajamas and were sitting in the bed facing each other. Agatha had opened her mouth to start talking when Rio held her hand up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait. I need to say something first. I am so sorry about last night and today. I spent today avoiding you because of everything that happened last night and how awkward I made things. I came here with a plan, but it didn’t go the way I thought it would. I think part of my drinking was needing courage, but I know that if I needed to drink to have the courage to talk, then Agatha, I’m not ready.” The look on her face was earnest, and there was regret and pain in her eyes. She hated herself for not being ready.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. If she were being honest with herself, she wasn’t quite there either. She nodded, her own blue eyes meeting Rio’s, filled with the same pain and sadness. “You’re right, and we can’t force it. No matter how tempting it may be.,” Agatha said softly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed heavily. “I doubt either of us will go to sleep quickly.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha laid on her back and put her arm out. “Come here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio assumed her position against Agatha, head on her shoulder, arm and leg over her. “Why is this so natural?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m a very comforting presence.” Agatha smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “You must be. Confession. Ever since the Ballad of the Witches’ Road came out, it’s been on my sleep playlist. All iterations of it. Several of your songs have been from over the years. Your voice has always calmed me and helped me go to sleep. When we met that day at SHIELD? I even fell asleep to The Ballad that night,” Rio knew her face was bright pink from her confession, but she didn’t care. It was important to share something personal, even if minor compared to the confession still locked up within.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked down at Rio, the small divulgence rolling around in her mind. She had comforted this woman for years and hadn’t even known it. Sure, she heard things like this all the time, but coming from Rio was, as always, different and felt special. “You can tell me that, but…”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s different, Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you for sharing that with me. It makes me feel very special, and now I know how to get you to sleep.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You are special, and having Agatha Harkness sing me a lullaby? Dream come true.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, then prepare yourself,” She smiled into Rio’s hair as she began to sing,
     <em>
      “Down, down, down the road…”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     If you had told 22-year-old Rio that Agatha Fucking Harkness would one day be one of her best friends and hold Rio in her arms while singing The Ballad to help her get to sleep, Rio would ask you to share whatever drugs you were on. Yet here she was, living that exact scenario, with zero drugs involved.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt Rio succumb to sleep as she sang and softly ran her fingers through Rio’s hair. Agatha thought it was one of the sweetest and most intimate things she had ever experienced. She didn’t understand how she could have these extremely intimate moments with Rio, yet to profess that which rattled about her core and begged for release scared the hell out of her.
     <em>
      Because you’re afraid she’ll reject you, and you can’t handle losing her.

     The return flight was rather uneventful, and they both knew they wouldn’t be able to see each other much the next few weeks. Agatha shared everything with Wanda Sunday evening. Wanda seriously considered slightly maiming her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I told you that taking her to ‘The Hex’ was a bad idea!” Wanda practically shouted.

     “I thought it would be fun! And it was fun but also a bad idea. It turned out, though, that neither of us was ready to have that discussion. And we’ve agreed to hold off that conversation until we are both ready. Not to force or rush it.” Agatha looked at her, knowing she would understand.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda deflated. “I know, I just was hoping for a summer wedding,” she teased.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha froze. She was trying to get the courage to date someone, which was already a leap from her fuck and forget days. She was NOT in love and nowhere near marriage. And here was Wanda talking about weddings.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry, what? Absolutely not. That is, just. No. Your wedding, maybe.” Agatha was short-circuiting.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda laughed. “WHOA! Okay, I struck a nerve there. Also, no, we haven’t talked about it either, though I do want to marry Nat. I’d marry her yesterday if I could.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know you would,” Agatha said, putting a hand on Wanda’s. “Back to me, though. What do I do now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You have an extremely busy schedule leading up to Halloween. You focus on that. Go cheer Nicky at the football game, and go nerd out together at the party. You’re there together anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “I’m surprised. That was a very mature answer.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t choose any days in the betting pool for the next two weeks.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You fucking love me.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice and Rio's conversations were mirror images of the ones that Wanda and Agatha had, as if in parallel universes. Ultimately, Alice conceded that she was proud of Rio for not forcing the issue no matter how much she had hoped otherwise.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The next two weeks had gone by quickly. Rio fell back into the school routine, and that Friday, Bayside beat SHIELD. Both teams would be in the playoffs the day after Halloween. Agatha was engrossed in filming, and while it was in LA, it often ran late. They texted, but many nights, it was just to say good night. They watched Halloween movies on their Saturday night, and they ended up falling asleep halfway through Hocus Pocus.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Finally, Halloween arrived, and with it the annual party. They were at some venue owned by Tony Stark. He held the party for the older kids and adults, around 10, and it transitioned to an adults-only event. Stark could be a pretentious asshole, but he liked parties and tried to do right by his daughter.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had on THE Moiraine traveling costume, a blue shirt and pants, boots, and a long blue coat with leather on the shoulders. Her long brown hair loose about her shoulders.  She loved the way she could use the coat as a cape and be dramatic with it. Rio was dressed as Moiraine’s nemesis, Lanfear. She had forgone the headpiece, but the black leather dress looked amazing on her. The right sleeve was long, and the shoulder was puffy. There were straps around the neck, and criss-cross straps on the left shoulder, otherwise that side was sleeveless. The neckline went straight across her chest with a studded belt right below her breasts. There was a piece in the middle of the dress that came down to the top of her knee that was separate from the sides of her dress, that split on both sides at the top of her thighs, giving a cape-like effect that went to her ankles. She had on wedge platform boots that laced up to mid-thigh and three black leather cuffs on her left wrist. She looked every bit the part of the evil lover of the devil she was portraying.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice and Jen were dressed in the classic Xena and Gabrielle costumes from the 90’s TV show, and Wanda still did the Fiyero and Glinda bit with Vision. It was even funnier knowing that Wanda was in love with Nat, dressed in a green and black suit, giving subtle Elphaba vibes. They were all team Gelphie, themselves. Tommy and Nicky were running around as zombies, and Billy and Eddie were Wiccan and Hulkling from The Young Avengers comics.
    </p>
<p>
     “Have they confirmed they’re dating yet?” Rio asked Wanda, nodding at the boys.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, but look at them. I wish he would just tell me.” She gestured at the two teenagers leaning into each other and acting like they were the only two people who existed.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re adorable.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re more put together than you and Agatha,” Wanda looked at her knowingly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, so you heard about New York?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, I did. And, close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you for comparing my dating life to yard games and weapons.” Rio scoffed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are we talking about violence?” Agatha asked, walking up to them.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Xena and Gabby costumes.” Rio lied before Wanda could say anything.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda rolled her eyes. “I’m going to go find my husband,” she looked at the ceiling before whispering, “or my girlfriend,” and giggled. She had been drinking, and while she was keeping everything quiet until after the holidays, she was getting very impatient.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “She’s going to get too bold, and someone’s going to find out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Probably,” Rio nodded. “After 25 years of hiding, can you blame her?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head, “Not at all. I’m so proud of her.” They were in a quiet area upstairs. “She told me that you were the one she talked to who gave her the push.” Rio and Agatha were facing each other, bodies only a few feet apart.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice and Jen, Wanda and Nat.” Agatha smiled. They had both decided not to drink and were completely sober.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m just your regular lesbian matchmaker. Maybe I can find someone for Vision after the divorce.” They both laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Honestly, you came into our group like a force of nature. It felt like you had always been one of us and truly belonged with us. With me. I can’t imagine our lives, my life, without you in it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Eyes locked, they had moved closer together, separated by only inches.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want a life without you in it, Agatha.” Rio’s eyes dropped to Agatha’s mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     Caught up in the moment, Agatha closed the space between them and wrapped her arms around Rio’s waist, pulling her flush against her, and pressed their lips together. Rio’s arms immediately went up and around Agatha’s shoulders as she pressed herself against Agatha, parting her lips to meet Agatha’s movements.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised her hand to cup Rio’s jaw as she slid her tongue against hers, deepening their kiss.
     <em>
      Finally,
     </em>
     Agatha thought. It was everything she had hoped and dreamed for months. They could go back to her place and talk. She was prepared. She was just so happy to finally kiss this amazing, beautiful woman.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hand had slid into Agatha’s hair as she used her tongue to explore Agatha’s mouth. She withdrew momentarily to bite Agatha’s bottom lip and then swallowed the whimper that followed. She scratched lightly at Agatha’s scalp as they battled each other for control of the kiss. Rio wondered if they could go back to Agatha’s since they didn’t have school tomorrow. Then it hit her. This was Agatha Harkness. Mother of one of her students. They still hadn’t talked, and that needed to happen before this could continue.
     <em>
      Fuck.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio froze, eyes flying open as she released her grip on Agatha and stepped back and out of her embrace.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes opened at the sudden loss. “Rio?” She saw the panic in Rio’s eyes and realized what had happened. “Hey, it’s okay, let’s talk.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes were wide as she shook her head. “Agatha, I…I can’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     She turned and bolted.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re an idiot, Harkness,” Agatha pinched her nose before turning on her heel and going after her. She reached the top of the stairs before she felt a hand on her arm. She turned her head to see Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sometimes, you have to give people processing time before they’re ready to talk to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had run. They had known they needed to figure things out before jumping in, and yet, they hadn’t. Everything could be ruined, and Rio’s emotions and thoughts were too unstable to figure it out here. She had pulled her phone out of a hidden pocket and texted Alice to meet her in the front and that they were leaving. Adding SOS next to it. She was crying as she, Jen, and Alice left.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha found Wanda and Nat staring in confusion as they watched Alice’s ride leave with the three women inside. Agatha silently cried as she watched the car disappear.
    </p>

<span>
      Agatha Fucking Harkness had kissed her like a soldier returning from war, and now Rio was curled up on her couch, head in Alice’s lap, hugging Raven, sobbing like she’d been dumped on prom night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nothing made sense anymore.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio. It’s okay. Why can’t you just talk to Agatha about it now?” Alice asked, rubbing her back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because I’m a coward, and what if she can’t accept it? What if it’s too much? We can’t go back. She’s one of my best friends, and now I know what it’s like to kiss her, and I will always want that,” She explained as the tears continued to fall.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice acted hurt, trying to lighten the mood, “Wait a minute! We’ve kissed!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen gasped from her spot in the armchair, “Wait, what?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave a small smile as Alice laughed. “We practiced kissing each other when we were in middle school,” Rio supplied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked relieved, “I don’t know what I was expecting, but that makes a lot of sense,” She regarded Rio for a moment. “Agatha won’t push you away, you know. She has an entire security team, everything will work out.” She paused momentarily, “Hell, Nat would probably go after the ex personally, and no one gets past Nat.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice nodded. “Rio, Agatha likes you, not just as a best friend, either.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged. “I just, I don’t know. There are a lot of other things too. The whole, she’s Agatha Fucking Harkness thing, for one.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen just groaned and looked at Alice. Alice looked at her de facto sister. “If she wasn’t one of the most famous people in the world and a parent of one of your students, and you just met, what would you do?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I assume in this hypothetical, all the feelings are still there? I would ask her out,” Rio replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then respond to one of the ungodly number of texts she’s sent you in the past two hours since we’ve left!” Jen nearly yelled, her tone bordering on frustration. It was only a matter of time before grainy photos leaked, and she still had a job to do.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio bit her lip. “I can’t, okay! I can’t bring potential harm to their doorstep.” Fresh tears streaming down her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice squeezed her shoulder. “You’re safe here, and that bitch isn’t going to do anything.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled onto her back, looking up at Alice, “I just don’t trust it, and pictures are all over the internet now from the premiere and a few from New York. You know that demon has seen them, and she knows, and she is definitely the jealous type.” Rio knew for a fact that she had seen them, but she wasn’t telling anyone that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen moved over to the couch, putting Rio’s legs over hers, “You two have never once told me this bitch’s name. Why?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s like summoning Beetlejuice,” Alice scoffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s not wrong. Also, when I say she’s a model, I mean somewhat well-known, and her husband IS well-known,” Rio added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yet, you’re worried about Agatha’s fame?” Jen shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I knew San Francisco was never going to make me public. Ever,” Rio shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen was filled with sadness for her friend. “That wasn’t a red flag for you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked down at Rio. “This one was collecting red flags like they were Pokemon. It’s why all of Agatha’s green ones scare her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha has her red flags, but they’re more from trauma,” Rio said, ignoring Alice’s very correct assessment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They’re more yellow, maybe orange,” Jen suggested. “I wouldn’t call them red.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat up, causing Raven to finally jump down. Rio crossed her legs and leaned back against the couch. “Agatha being more than willing to break the law, and breaking the law, might be a red flag…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Eh, depends on the reason,” Alice said, waving Rio off. “Anyway, back to the matter at hand. What are you going to do? You can’t just ignore her. It’s currently,” She checked her phone, “two in the morning, and there’s a football playoff game at six-ish tonight. You know you have to be there.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio groaned. “You’re right, I can’t skip it. I have to support Nicky, and the rest of the team. With injuries, Tommy is playing in it. I’ll figure it out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It will just be awkward.” Jen mused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “I just don’t know what to do. We need to talk, but I don’t know how to start that conversation now. ‘Thanks for kissing me in a way that might screw me up forever if it never happens again, but let me tell you about the time I was almost murdered and how I have a crazy ex-girlfriend who is also a stalker. Oh, and there’s a restraining order. A TEMPORARY restraining order because the judge is a fan of hers and her husband.’ That will go over like a pregnant pole-vaulter.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen sighed. “I’ll be ready for her to call the lawyers, call in favors, pull strings, the things Agatha does.” She put a comforting hand on Rio’s shoulder. “Everything will be okay.” Rio nodded. “If you guys think so. It’s just, my ex is a sociopath.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice put an arm across Rio’s shoulders. “I know she is honey, but we have a…former…assassin, two extremely powerful and connected actresses, a fixer, me - your knight of wands, and you, our mad scientist. It’s going to be fine. Right now, we need to focus on how you’re going to handle this.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sniffled. “Like an adult. Hug my cat, ignore the pretty girl, and drink.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No,” Jen and Alice said simultaneously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You don’t have to respond to her tonight or even talk to her in the next day or so, okay? You can take a break. However, you need to decide what you’re going to do. Tell her everything or decide you aren’t ready and take a few steps back?” Alice laid it out plainly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew she wanted to tell Agatha everything. She also knew that it wasn’t just dating parents, dating scared her as a whole. She had dated the crazy bitch for two years and been in love with her, and it had ended badly. She wanted Agatha, yes, but they were going to have to take this slowly, and she wasn’t sure if Agatha would be okay with that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was also what she wasn’t telling Alice and Jen, and that was that crazy pants had absolutely seen the pictures and had sent Rio a message from a blocked number. Rio had ignored it, hoping there would be zero follow-up, but it still existed.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda filled Vision in on what had happened, and he took over teenager duty while she and Nat took Agatha back to the compound. The boys were going to a co-ed sleepover, and Vision had volunteered to be one of the parent chaperones. No one had trusted a bunch of hormone-filled teenagers to be left to their own devices. They may be rich and famous, but they weren’t stupid.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Back at Agatha’s, free of makeup and in comfortable clothing, Agatha was staring at her phone as if it would do tricks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Honey, I don’t think she’s going to respond,” Wanda looked at her like she was delivering horrible news.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chewed on her thumb. “I fucked up.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You did,” Nat agreed. “But in your defense, something had to give, and no one was talking.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda cut her eyes to Nat and back to Agatha. “Nat is…partially right. You two have to talk, and soon, now. You have now pulled back the curtain and know what’s there.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fireworks,” Agatha interrupted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’ll talk about all that in a moment,” Wanda continued, “Now you two know that for anything to continue, you have to talk. It’s time. You can’t go back. You can’t just push that aside.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, it’s just, what if she doesn’t like what she sees. We can’t go back, and I can’t take back that kiss. What do I do then? Say, sorry, I shoved my tongue down your throat? That was the best kiss of my life, and we KNOW what that means, but let’s just go back to being friends?” Agatha threw both hands in the air, her fingers spread out towards the ceiling, a questioning look on her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Now we’re going back in circles and beating a dead horse. AGATHA! You won’t know until you talk to her!” Wanda grabbed her by her shoulders and shook her a little while Nat huffed a laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha dropped her arms. “I’m so glad you two are taking this seriously.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked at her, “Aggie, we are. Trust me. You have been there for us for the past 25 years as we’ve navigated our own mess, and we will be here for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How will I talk to Rio if she won’t respond?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The football game tomorrow!” Wanda suddenly remembered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, let me have a heart-to-heart with my son’s TEACHER at the high school football game,” Agatha said sarcastically, “I am sure she will be totally comfortable baring her soul in front of the whole school. Afterward, we could all go get ice cream.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’d go get ice cream.” Nat mocked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, just, please, don’t fuck it up again. I know you hate talking about your feelings and opening up, but you have to tell her everything. Not the vague story like you told us, everything. You don’t have to tell her who it was, just lay your heart bare and let her heal it.” Wanda looked at her pleadingly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was picking at loose threads on her yoga pants and just nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I really thought I’d be mad at her for running, but I’m not. I can’t be. I respect her too much, and, I just, if we end up not working out and remain friends forever, that’s fine.” A tear rolled down Agatha’s cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat just shook her head. “Spoken like a true overdramatic lesbian.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda rolled her eyes, “I know that you’re worried about losing the friendship aspect of all this, but Agatha, that woman is as down bad for you as you are for her. Neither of you will run.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at them both as she wiped the tears from her eyes. “I’m going to tell her why I don’t date teachers, and why I don’t do relationships…she doesn’t need to know I was ever in love. Only three people know about that. The two of you, vaguely, and the woman I loved. She and I can discuss that part later.” She spoke calmly, mind made up. The truth about her tragic love life was quite awful, and she didn’t think Rio was ready for that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda put her hand over her eyes and groaned. “That’s going to blow up in your face later, dumbass.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat put a comforting hand on her unofficial girlfriend’s back, “It will, but we’ll be here to help them both because we are gluttons for punishment.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled, “Thank you both for your service. In the meantime, why won’t she answer?” She pouted, still staring at her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because she’s scared, if it was the best kiss of YOUR life, you whore,” Wanda said with love, “then it probably was for her too. Was it really fireworks?” She perked up, wanting details.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes at the name-calling, she had zero shame about her past, “God, yes. Do you know how terrifying that is?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes,” Nat and Wanda said simultaneously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course you two do, but you ended up together,” Agatha pointed out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, but I didn’t always know we would,” Wanda pointed out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What if we don’t?” Agatha frowned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked at her seriously, “How do you know if you don’t try?”
     </span>

      SHIELD hadn’t reached the playoffs in years, and Lilia Calderu was extremely proud of her school full of nepo babies and kids born with silver spoons in their mouths. Her kids worked hard, practiced hard, played hard, and were dedicated.  They deserved this just as much as any other school in the Trinity League. Of course, with the NDAs in place and the secrecy that shrouded the school she ran, the media was extremely unhappy as they were only being allowed to cover the very basics of the game. If SHIELD did make the finals, there would be negotiating with lawyers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The coven sat in the bleachers as they always did, cheering on Nicky, and now Tommy and Eddie who had both been moved to the varsity team to cover injuries. Billy still wouldn’t admit that he and Eddie were dating and just turned red when anyone insinuated as much. While Rio usually sat next to Agatha, she was not sure what to do or say about the kiss the night before. Knowing that a high school football game was not the place for it, Rio did her best to distance herself from Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hadn’t felt this awkward at a football game since high school when she had been caught making out with Sabrina Spellman, the quarterback’s girlfriend, underneath the bleachers. Maybe she needed to swear off alcohol AND women.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice leaned into her friend, “Maybe you should talk to her after the game?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. “I’m good, thanks.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was in agony. She was trying to watch her son as he was completing his passes, making touchdowns, running in a touchdown, and generally getting the job done. However, she kept looking at the raven-haired woman a row below her who had constantly been on her mind since they had met at the end of July. Why was this so hard? She turned to Wanda. “We’re going out tonight.” She said decisively.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s a terrible idea,” Wanda shook her head. Nothing good could come from this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, I’m going, with or without you,” Agatha tapped Jen’s shoulder in the row below her. “Hey, after the game, we’re going out. Let Alice and Rio know.” She straightened back up as the other team scored.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      SHIELD won, advancing to the next round that would take place the following week. The boys were going to a celebratory party, and Vision had volunteered to be one of the parent chaperones. Rio had decided to skip going out with the coven, though everyone else had decided to go, even if just to keep an eye on Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was another exclusive club. Agatha didn’t like to risk paparazzi and bad publicity, for which Jen was eternally grateful. Wanda was concerned. Agatha normally didn’t allow herself to get too drunk in public, yet here she was, ten drinks in, no end in sight, and her four babysitters kept losing track of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do NOT let her make out with or sneak off with anyone!” Wanda instructed. Nat was on security detail, and she couldn’t even keep track of Agatha. Alice was looking around the crowded club, eyes wide.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Where did she go?” She asked Wanda, eyes wide, with panic in her voice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s being stupid and self-destructive,” Wanda replied knowingly. “If you see a crowd forming, check it. She’ll most likely be in the middle, controlling all of the women around her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen was worried for other reasons, “If anyone pulls out a phone that they didn’t check in, take it. Not everyone follows the rules,” She instructed, knowing good and well that Agatha was one who did not follow the rules.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had split up to track down the drunken disaster. Agatha, however, was in the middle of the dancefloor having a great time. She was dancing with two women she knew, both actresses' though their faces were blurring together. She had changed before coming out, wearing some black, sleeveless, faux leather number. She was numb from alcohol, having lost count of how much she had had to drink, a feat for her, really, and was ready to revert to her old ways. Agatha had her choice of women and was surveying her choices when a woman she didn’t know cut in and started to take Agatha’s attention and took her from everyone else. The woman was gorgeous, with long wavy blonde hair, blue-green eyes, mid-40s if Agatha had to guess. She was dancing suggestively against Agatha, and as far gone as Agatha was, she had lost all control and inhibition. She vaguely remembered being pulled to a dark corner, a mouth pressed to hers, a flash, and something slipped in and out of her pocket, when a familiar redhead pulled them apart “I am so sorry honey, but she is spoken for,” Wanda told the other woman as she pried Agatha away, “you may have better luck with someone else.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned towards Wanda, “What’re you doing?” She slurred.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Keeping you from making a huge mistake. C’mon, my toasted friend. We’re getting you out of here,” Wanda put her arm around Agatha’s waist as Nat joined them. “Let’s gather Alice and Jen.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not done,” Agatha argued as she stumbled into Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, you are. This will just make things worse, especially if you do anything else.” Wanda and Nat led Agatha to the car, who, surprisingly, didn’t put up a fight. Wanda looked at Jen and Alice as they approached.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The two of you are going to Jen’s place tonight,” she instructed. “Rio isn’t going to have an out. Yes, that’s where this one is going,” Agatha was already in the back of the SUV.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s a good idea,” Jen agreed. “Take the highly vulnerable drunk to Rio’s. Let her sober up there. One of them will confess something.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They went their separate ways as Wanda and Nat headed towards Rio’s, with Agatha moaning about how much she had messed up. She hadn’t realized where they were going until they stood at Rio’s door. Nat had Agatha’s go bag on one shoulder, and they were both holding her up. Wanda knocked as a courtesy, though she had the spare key Alice had given her just in case.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was not expecting anyone. It was almost midnight, and she and Raven had just finished a bowl of ice cream while they watched Agatha Harkness movies so Rio could torture herself. She was wearing old threadbare pajamas and almost shut the door when she saw a drunk Agatha being supported by the two redheads.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This belongs to you,” Wanda said, pushing their way in before Rio could slam the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She does not,” Rio replied, much quieter than she meant. Those were not the words she thought Wanda would say, and she wanted them to be true.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t belong to anybody,” Agatha proclaimed, stumbling onto the couch, “Well, except the Mouse,” she added, giggling after remembering the Marvel and Disney contracts she had recently signed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat patted her on the shoulder. “Of course, honey. You’re going to stay with Rio. Nicky is with Vision, okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded as Wanda handed her water.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda turned back to Rio. “Look, she doesn’t get this drunk, especially in public. Even if you have to wait until morning, just talk, please,” Wanda hugged her, kissed Agatha on the head, grabbed Nat’s hand, and left, giving them a meaningful look before closing the door behind them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned back to Agatha, who was eyeing her from the couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, hot stuff, did I leave the oven on, or is it just you?” Agatha said playfully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes as she grabbed Agatha’s bag and found pajamas, “Can you change yourself?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’d rather you strip me down. This dress would look great on your bedroom floor.” She replied, trying her best to be seductive.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had to bite back a laugh. “Just like you, Harkness, I would not take advantage of you. I am a lady.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tried to be serious, “No one has ever accused me of being a lady, and you would not be taking advantage, trust me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio blushed, “While I am flattered by the drunken admission, you can’t consent when you’re drunk. I won’t accept it. Back to the original question, are you stable enough to change yourself?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even in her hazy state, Agatha knew Rio was right. “Can you unzip me first?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded and unzipped the dress, admiring Agatha’s toned back as she stumbled off towards the bathroom. Rio had to admit. The dress would have looked great on her floor, flung over a chair, the couch…wherever it had landed. She did follow Agatha at a distance, just in case. Agatha stumbled out of the bathroom a few minutes later. Rio was impressed that her pajamas were on correctly and that she hadn’t fallen over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Alright Blitzen, let’s get you to the bed where you’re safe.” Rio guided her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had already decided that Agatha was taking the bed and she would take the couch. As much as it pained Rio to sleep in the same place and not sleep next to Agatha, she didn’t trust either of them. As it was, she wanted to feel Agatha’s lips on hers again, but this was not the time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ooh, you are taking me to bed!” Agatha grinned, as Rio tucked her in. “Wait, are you not sleeping with me?” Agatha looked at her, confused and hurt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave her a small smile and sat on the bed facing Agatha,, before caressing her cheek with the back of her hand. “No, I’m going to take the couch. I don’t think this is the best time to sleep next to you. Based on our kiss last night, there’s something here, and we need to talk before anything else happens.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had wrapped a hand around Rio’s wrist, holding her hand in place as she leaned into the touch. “Let’s talk now.” Her eyelids were heavy, and she looked up at Rio through her eyelashes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at her softly, “Would you remember in the morning? Or stay awake for the entire discussion?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha yawned. “Fuck.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Exactly.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Will you stay until I fall asleep?” Agatha asked. She had let go of Rio’s wrist and removed Rio’s hand from her cheek, opting to hold it, intertwining their fingers instead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. Agatha was vulnerable when she was drunk. It was much different than what she was used to. Rio moved to sit next to Agatha, back against the headboard and played with her hair in the way she knew Agatha liked. Agatha sighed with contentment as the alcohol overtook her body.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, why did you decide to go out and drink tonight?” Rio asked, chewing on her lip. If she was going to get an honest answer, it was now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mad at myself. Thought I’d lost you,” Agatha replied, voice laced with sleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew the answer to her next question but needed it confirmed. She knew she was technically taking advantage of Agatha, but also knew that this was the master of deflection, and this was the best time to get around that. “Aggie, when was the last time you slept with someone?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nuzzled against Rio’s thigh. “Two days before I met you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re the only one I’ve wanted since the day I met you at SHIELD.” Her voice had started to trail off as she quickly lost her fight to stay awake.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat there, running her fingers through Agatha’s hair as she slept. She knew it was time to tell her everything in the morning. If Agatha rejected her because of her past and the danger it posed, then, she rejected her. But she had to come clean finally. Rio leaned over and kissed Agatha on the forehead, second-guessing her decision to sleep on the couch before she reminded herself it was the right thing to do. She grabbed a pillow and a blanket from the closet before deciding to sleep on a makeshift bed on the floor instead, to at least be close to Agatha. Raven, the traitor, slept with Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha woke up in the morning a bit hazy but fine. She rarely got hangovers, a superpower from her years of heavy drinking. She heard purring in her ear and turned to see Raven curled up next to her head. “You are not the woman of the house I wanted to see first thing this morning,” She said as she scratched the feline on the head. She looked around to see her bag on top of the dresser and smiled at how thoughtful Rio had been. She followed her normal morning routine, put on sweats and a SHIELD football shirt that had been in her bag, and left her hair down. She wouldn’t make this morning awkward and barely remembered what she had said to Rio last night. She was determined to have that overdue conversation this morning. She could smell coffee and food and walked towards the kitchen to see Rio putting bacon and eggs on a second plate.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned against the door frame and smiled as she imagined cooking together in her kitchen at the compound. “You took care of my drunk ass, and now you’re making me breakfast?” She had one eyebrow raised and her arms crossed over her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed as she turned around, handing her a plate. “I’ve gotta make sure you're sober before we talk. We’re eating in the living room. Coffee is already there.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They both sat on the couch, facing each other. Raven jumped up between them as Rio looked at her, “Bacon is in your bowl, Your Majesty,” Raven meowed her thanks and hopped back down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed, “I still think it’s funny that she eats the way she does.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged, “You’ve tried telling her no before. You know how insistent she is.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had indeed learned how insistent the immortal cat was. She would use her paw and snatch what she wanted. When you were as old as Raven was, you got to do what you wanted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Agatha. “Before I share anything with you, you have to know that if anything happens between us, Raven comes first. She is my second longest relationship, after Alice,” she said seriously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. “Got it. I feel Raven could murder me in my sleep, so that’s fine.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had already finished her breakfast and set her plate down, taking a deep breath. “Remember how I told Wanda I moved out here for a fresh start and to be near Alice or whatever bullshit?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hadn’t forgotten anything from that day. “Of course.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, it was partially true. I mainly left San Francisco because of a woman. My main rule for not dating parents is because I did date a parent, and it ended badly.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How badly?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I ended up in the hospital and almost died,” Rio waited for Agatha’s reaction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had to make herself breathe normally. She wanted to know who the bitch was and make sure they could never hurt Rio again. “Rio, what happened?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took a deep breath, “Roughly three years ago, I had a very sweet student that I noticed right off the bat needed to be in advanced classes. I met her mom at an open house a few weeks after school started. The mom and I hit it off automatically and became friends. We’re just going to call her SF for San Francisco. She’s kind of famous. She was having problems in her marriage and opened up to me about it. Hubby is very famous. I’m not saying what he does. I did sign an NDA. SF had everyone around her sign NDAs, as she’s very paranoid. Anyway, I was under the impression that hubby was out of the picture and they were getting a divorce, or else we never would have dated, and we dated for twoish years, off and on. I knew that she would never be public with me., She would always be closeted, for her career, and I was okay with that,” Rio paused and looked at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took Rio’s hand. “I would never want to hide you, Rio. I can’t imagine how you felt when Wan..”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No,” Rio interrupted, “That was not the same. I honestly thought the husband was completely out of the picture. Wanda has always been completely honest with Nat. Wanda Maximoff had zero nefarious reasons for what she did. SF is a sociopath. Natasha Romanov is one of the most patient and amazing humans I know who never gave up on the woman she loves. I was an idiot that ignored a lot of red flags.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head, “I was going to say, ‘When Wanda had a similar story that turned out to have a happy ending.’”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just blushed. “Sorry, I jumped to conclusions. Anyway, after two years of on-again, off-again, and hubby coming in and out of the picture, I ended things for good. She started to stalk me, and I had to get a restraining order on a parent. A famous one at that, which was hard to do, and the school tried to fire me. The union had to get involved. It was extremely messy. The order is only temporary because the judge is a fan of theirs. That was last March. Well, when the restraining order was filed and served, the husband found out. I was out for a run one weekend, and I was tackled out of nowhere,” Rio stopped and looked away. She had started breathing rapidly, the anxiety filling her with a sense of dread. She wasn’t sure she could handle this. But, she was almost to the finish line, but she wasn’t sure if she could tell Agatha the rest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha saw that Rio was starting to panic. She took both of Rio’s hands and pulled her closer to her. “Rio,” she whispered, “You’re not going to scare me away. You don’t have to finish the rest if you aren’t ready, okay, sweetie?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She moved her hands to cradle Rio’s face, looking into her eyes with concern, care, and something else Rio couldn't quite place.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I understand why dating parents, or anyone, would scare you, but I want you, all of you. I will face anything with you, no matter what it is.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wanted to melt into Agatha right then. Agatha Fucking Harkness wanted her: Rio Vidal, ordinary human, teacher, sixteen years Agatha’s junior, crazy cat lady, as damaged as she was. This amazing, beautiful goddess of a person that she had somehow automatically befriended three months ago was here, on her couch, willing to take on her darkest secrets because she wanted Rio. Rio searched Agatha’s eyes, looking for any hint of doubt, anything that meant she might not want to do this, and found none.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay.” Rio nodded, tears falling down her cheeks. “It’s easier to just show you, though.” Rio moved back, and Agatha’s hands fell from Rio’s face. Rio picked up her phone, opened up her photos, and scrolled back to the spring, before finding the pictures of her in the hospital. She sighed as she handed the device to Agatha, “I wish I could say it looks worse than it was, but…” She trailed off as Agatha raised the phone and scrolled through the pictures. Rio watched her reactions closely as Agatha gasped at what she saw. Rio’s black eye and swollen jaw, throat red from where he had attempted to strangle her. The black, blue, and purple bruises that had blossomed over her left side from shoulder to hip. The stitches over her ribcage from the stab wounds there. Agatha looked up. “I’ve seen you in a bikini. Why didn’t I see the scars?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged, “You have to look closely. They blend in. They’ve also faded over the months.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked back, scrapes and cuts on her right side from where she had skidded on the pavement. “Any internal injuries?” She asked quietly, tears falling from her own eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A few, nothing major. Lost my appendix somehow. Still not sure how that correlated.” She scoffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s why Alice left so abruptly. She said there was an emergency and wouldn’t let any of us come. Nat asked if it was her type of emergency, but she wouldn’t say anything.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “A day later,  Lilia showed up at Alice’s request. It’s when I got the offer to come here.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course, Alice did, to make sure you’re safe because you’re important to Alice.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave her a soft smile as she put down the phone. She reached up and lightly ran her fingertips over Rio’s face where the bruises had been as if trying to heal the memories themselves. Agatha trailed her fingers down Rio’s neck and then lightly down the sides of her body over her clothes, careful not to put too much pressure, as if the bruises and cuts were still there. Agatha never broke eye contact as she took Rio in, trying her best to soothe the memories of what had happened all those months ago. She reached Rio’s knees and ran her hands back up to Rio’s shoulders slowly. Rio’s eyes fluttered closed as she gasped lightly from the contact. Agatha ran her hands down Rio’s side one more time before she rested them on Rio’s knees. She didn’t need to explain anything. Rio knew Agatha was trying to replace and erase the memory, as well as make sure she was really here, “I wish I could say I can’t believe he got away with it, but, well…” she trailed off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just looked at her breathlessly. Agatha had just barely touched her, and she felt as if her soul had left her body. Agatha had tried to replace her memories in a way only Agatha Harkness could, tears slowly rolling down both of their cheeks as Rio continued their conversation. “Yes, well. He did. I finished the school year and moved out here right before school started. I had to wait until I was well enough to move. I had a few cracked ribs that took a little while to heal and a concussion from where my head hit the pavement. They basically bribed me to stay quiet, on top of the NDA,”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was picking at her sweats. Agatha wiped Rio’s tears away and turned her face to look at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, I understand, and I will never intentionally hurt you. We can go as slowly as you want, but none of that was your fault.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, there’s something else.” Rio worried at her lip. Afraid that this would be the thing that drove Agatha away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She, SF, has a history of stalking. She’s insane. Our photos have been everywhere. She knows…” Rio rambled, not able to actually tell Agatha that SF had contacted her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. “Honey. I’ve been stalked before. It comes with the territory. I have a security team. I have a Natasha. We will all be okay. WE are safe. YOU are safe. NICKY is safe. I will make sure of it. We all will.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She leaned forward and pressed their foreheads together, reveling in the touch and closeness. They were so close to actually starting something, and Agatha could feel it in her bones.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re sure you’re okay with all this?” Rio asked. “Crazy stalker ex and… me? Rio felt like she was naked before Agatha, all the parts of her exposed and visible. She needed to be sure that Agatha truly understood and was clear that she accepted all of Rio and everything that came with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good.” This time, it was Rio who kissed Agatha. In it, she conveyed a simple message, “I’m yours.” It was lighter and shorter than either of them would have liked, but it was Rio’s way of ending her side of this conversation. As she pulled away from Agatha, she brushed a strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear. “I love your hair and could play with it for hours,” she mused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled. “I’ve noticed.” Her eyes looked behind Rio to the green eyes that were glaring at her. “Um, how well does Raven share? I feel like she’s plotting my demise.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio grinned. “She does not, and she probably is.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then, before we continue this conversation, it’s Saturday. Want to go ahead and move this to my house?” She kept her eyes on the cat that now looked at her like she was telepathically giving her the rules for dating Rio, and they all ended with death.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just laughed, “I can’t believe you’re afraid of Raven, but yes, let me grab a bag and text Alice to feed her before she comes to the compound.” She said as she went to her room to grab a few things.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That is not your average housecat, and why don’t you just leave food down for her?” Agatha called towards the bedroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How dare you insult her like that! Have you not noticed she eats a very delicate mix of wet and dry food? How dare you not know what my cat eats!” Rio called back, trying her hardest to sound offended.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha made eye contact with Raven and whispered, “If I buy you a fancy wet food auto feeder, will you like me and put in a good word to your human for me?” Raven meowed and stretched before pawing at Agatha’s nose. “I’ll take that as a strong maybe.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio drove them to the compound, holding Agatha’s hand the entire time. They talked about the next football game and what movies they thought Wanda and Nat would choose to watch that night. Rio felt so much better having her stalker past off her chest, even if she hadn’t shared the current situation. Agatha was right. SF couldn’t do anything, not with the whole security team around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they got to the house, Agatha was starting to get nervous. How much did she want to tell Rio? She knew she would eventually share everything, but she should probably do like she told Nat and Wanda and only share part of it. She took both of their duffel bags upstairs and tossed them in her room before coming downstairs. In the span of five minutes, all three boys had appeared and were talking to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey Mom! Rio reminded us we have a test on Monday. Please tell her that we should be exempt because we won a playoff game,” Nicky teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “For that, she should give you a test and a pop quiz,” Agatha shot back as she walked to the kitchen to grab something for lunch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Aunt Aggie, I heard a rumor…” Tommy started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Finish that sentence, and I’ll cut out your tongue,” Agatha said from the kitchen as she put leftover vegetable lo mein Rio had made the other night in the microwave.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Such violence,” Rio giggled. “Billy, how’s Eddie?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy blushed, “Fine,” he mumbled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Tommy and Nicky continued to go back and forth with Agatha, Rio put her hand on Billy’s arm and spoke quietly. “Hey, if you ever want to talk to me, you can, okay? You’re surrounded by lesbians. You don’t have to hide anything.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy shrugged. “Don’t I though? Mom and Aunt Nat have hidden for how long now? I know they think we don’t know, but we do. We’ve known forever. Mom and Dad have pretended to be this perfect couple our whole lives like we don’t have eyes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was trying her best to remain neutral. “How do you feel about that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He sighed, “Tommy and I want all of them to be happy. We wouldn’t be upset if they divorced. Dad deserves to find someone, and Mom and Aunt Nat deserve to be together. We found some really old pictures of them together. Printed ones from the late 1900’s!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stifled a laugh. “Billy, I think you and Tommy need to talk with your parents.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He nodded. “Three out of the four. Aunt Aggie can sit this one out. Thank you, Rio. I hope you and Aunt Aggie work out.” He hugged her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, Billy, are you done talking to my future stepmom? We’re going to the clubhouse. Oh, Rio, should I call you bonus mom, or are you more of a stepdad?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “NICHOLAS!” Agatha yelled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “BYE!” All three boys shouted as they ran out of the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had collapsed onto the couch laughing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha brought their lunch and water and set it down, looking at the younger woman. “I apologize for that child of mine.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. “I don’t know, ‘Stepdaddy Rio’ has a nice ring to it,” She teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      On the inside, Agatha was panicking but appeared calm on the exterior as she smiled and kissed Rio on the cheek, close to the corner of her mouth. The mention of anything related to marriage scared her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio ate quickly before filling Agatha in on what Billy said. Agatha nodded. “We’ll let the redheaded wonders know, and they can have that discussion with the twins. This means Nicky knows too, and we’ll talk to Nicky about us once we decide what we are.” Agatha said, locking eyes with Rio. Rio nodded, taking their empty dishes to the kitchen and loading them in the dishwasher before returning. She sat, turned towards Agatha, and took her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Talk to me, Aggie. I showed you mine. Show me yours.” She kissed the back of Agatha’s hand as she gazed into the blue eyes that had begun to feel like home, propped her elbow on the back of the couch, and placed her cheek on her fist.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was Agatha’s turn to take a deep breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, first, my no-teacher rule, which is newer. So, it’s no secret that Lilia lets me do whatever I want. I’m a big donor to the school, and my son is the star quarterback. Well, with my previous reputation being what it was, I had my fun with every somewhat single sapphic teacher, and some not so single or sapphic for at least a few hours, teachers. It caused a lot of drama.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not surprised,” Rio said dryly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No one was. Since I was the one that brought Alice out here, and I was a good friend of her mom’s, that never happened. Just so you know,” Agatha reassured her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t think it had,” Rio had never even questioned it once.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, I swore off any more people at SHIELD. Lilia was very grateful for that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat up. “Lilia is somewhat encouraging of this, though,” She gestured between them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled, “Oh, she’ll encourage something if SHE thinks it’s right. That’s Lilia Calderu for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just shook her head. That sounded like the Lilia she had gotten to know. “Okay, and the Nicky of that equation?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “As long as he doesn’t try to get special treatment, it’s fine,” Agatha assured.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then, the big question, Agatha Harkness, is why don’t you do relationships?” Rio looked at her softly, awaiting the answer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, but remember, you asked,” Agatha’s mind raced as she considered exactly how much she would share. Rio had shared so much, but Agatha didn’t want to put too much on her. “This life is a lot, and it’s a lot to ask of anyone to take on. Filming schedules, my traveling. You’ve only gotten a small taste of it. Not to mention constant speculation, harassment online, just everything that goes along with this much fame. It’s a lot of pressure. It’s a lot to ask of someone else to endure with me. You’re used to NDAs at this point, and not being able to share everything, so that’s helpful. There will be times when we don’t see each other for months at a time, and every time I am pictured with another woman, rumors will fly.” She was drawing from experience, from things that had happened the last time she was with someone. The constant arguing, the accusations.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took Agatha’s hand in hers. “Remember what I told you when we were preparing for the premiere? I can handle anything with you next to me. I meant that, Agatha. We have circled this thing between us for months now, and I know we’re afraid something will happen and affect our friendship, but I think we need to try.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wanted this, she wasn’t worried about distance or time spent apart, and she could ignore speculation and the media, couldn’t she? After all, sometime in the last three months, Agatha had become one of the closest people in her life. The last person she wanted to hear from before she went to sleep at night. The person she looked forward to seeing every weekend, the arms she woke up in most Sunday mornings. This felt right, and she needed to see where it would lead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled. She knew she should tell Rio the rest, but Rio hadn’t pushed, so she wasn’t going to say anything either. It’s not like they were in love, and if those feelings came up, then she would potentially cross that bridge. Agatha wasn’t even sure if she was capable of that anymore. She knew she cared for Rio in a way that scared her, but she wasn’t in love with her, right?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I guess now we decide where we want to go from here. I don’t expect you to jump into anything, and I want to move at a pace you’re comfortable with.” Agatha said looking into Rio’s eyes, and saw the slightest hint of fear and hesitation. She knew Rio was still  nervous.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I trust you, Agatha, I do, it’s just…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You don’t have the best track record.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s putting it mildly.”Rio grimaced. SF wasn’t the only person she had dated, however, none of her relationships had ended particularly well. “I want you, Agatha, not like a friend either. You’re right that I don’t want to jump into anything.” She had looked away and was rubbing her chest trying to calm herself down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha used two fingers to tip Rio’s chin and turn it towards her. “Can I take you on an actual date? Next Saturday?” Agatha asked softly.
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
      Electricity was shooting through Rio, and part of her was ready to say fuck it and beg Agatha to take her to bed, but Rio knew she wasn’t ready for that, no matter how much she wanted to or had fantasized about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Have you ever been on a date?” Rio asked as she raised an eyebrow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I might be a bit rusty, but I think I can manage.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’ll miss movie night…” Rio stalled with a slight smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Will you please answer me and put me out of my misery?” Agatha slid her hand around to rest behind Rio’s neck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes,” Rio brought her hands up and ran them through Agatha’s hair as Agatha moaned lightly at the touch. “If you don’t kiss me right now, I might implode.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha used her grip on the back of Rio’s neck to pull her towards her as Agatha surged forward to meet Rio’s lips with her own. Rio sighed into Agatha’s mouth as their lips met. The kiss was slow, passionate, and exploratory. Hands in hair and light caresses, tongues intertwining.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was relieved to see Rio’s black Grand Cherokee in front of Agatha’s house. “Oh good, she didn’t kick Agatha out. She brought her home.” She said to Nat, as they walked towards the front door, holding hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hopefully, they finally talked and are getting somewhere,” Nat said as they walked in the door and to the living room where they froze as Agatha and Rio kissed on the couch before them. Wanda’s hands flew up to her face as she squealed. “They got somewhere all right,” Nat smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned bright red as she broke their kiss, looking down. “Umm, hi,” She said breathlessly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her hair back and turned towards the very unwelcome intruders. “Are we going to have to start putting a sock on the door?” She asked with a sarcastic smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I recall there’s an entire scrunchie system,” Nat offered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What’s this about scrunchies?” Jen asked as she and Alice came in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thinking about ways to do your hair when it finally grows back,” Agatha grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked at how Rio and Agatha were still sitting facing each other, Rio with an arm on Agatha’s shoulder, playing with her hair. Agatha’s hand on Rio’s thigh, knees pressed together. Wanda and Nat were facing the couch, and Wanda’s pupils were dilated like she’d seen a ghost… or her sister making out with one of her best friends.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha and Rio were making out!” Alice suddenly exclaimed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio groaned, “A little louder, Alice. I don’t think they heard you in Mexico.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda finally regained her ability to function, “So, is this happening?? Did you talk? Tell us everything!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Everyone took their normal positions and focused on Agatha and Rio. Rio was bright red and nudged Agatha to adjust how they were sitting to face their friends more comfortably. Agatha smiled and got the hint. She knew Rio wanted to lean on Agatha right now, not wanting to be the main focus. She turned, facing forward, propping her legs up on the coffee table. She put her arm around Rio as Rio laid her head on Agatha’s shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We are going on a date Saturday if you must know. And yes, we’ve talked. You’re all nosey.” Agatha recapped.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda narrowed her eyes. “That’s all we’re getting, Harkness?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “For now, yes, because you and Nat are needed at your house. The twins need to talk with the two of you and your husband,” Agatha looked at both of them softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The color drained from both redhead’s faces, as Jen’s eyes went wide as she looked at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do I need to prepare a statement now?” Jen looked between Agatha and Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda just looked at Agatha, waiting for her to continue, but it was Rio that spoke.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I asked Billy why he wouldn’t tell us about him and Eddie. I told him he didn’t have to hide. He said that you, Wanda, and Nat have hidden his whole life, so why shouldn’t he? He and Tommy know. They have known, for as long as either of them can remember, they’ve known. They aren’t mad at any of you. They want the three of you to be happy, but they want to sit down and talk to ‘three of their four parents’.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was Rio’s turn to look softly at Wanda and Nat, and both women were trying to hold back tears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Damn my sons for being empaths,” Wanda whispered as Nat squeezed her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at Jen, “As far as damage control goes, I say we still wait to say anything publicly until after the holidays, calm before the storm and all. Let us all adjust before everyone is calling for interviews and statements. Our family will not be dealing with that over the holidays,” She stated with finality. Agatha was the matriarch of this coven and found family, and they were thankful for it. She looked over at Wanda and Nat. “Now, go get your asses handed to you by two of our boys.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they left, Jen turned towards her other potential PR nightmare, “Any statements about the two of you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at Rio, “It’s up to you, as fast or slow as you want.” She said as she squeezed Rio’s hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled at her before turning to Jen. “Nothing yet. We’re going on a first date next weekend, and if people take pictures and speculate, let them. We’re not together, officially, so no need to make any statements.” She felt wrong saying it, but she also knew it was the right approach.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice and Jen both caught the flash of hurt across Agatha’s face, but didn’t acknowledge it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was then that Agatha Fucking Harkness vowed to woo over Rio Fucking Vidal if it was the last thing she did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tommy and Billy Maximoff had made their parents, and Aunt Nat sit on the couch as they sat on the one to the side. They looked like two fathers who were very disappointed in their three teenage children. Billy, being the more well-spoken of the two, started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sure Aunt Aggie and Rio filled you in a bit,” he started. The three adults nodded as he continued. “We found some very old photos a year or so ago that only confirmed what we already knew, and have known, for as long as we remember.” He handed the pictures over to his Mom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took the pictures, and the other two adults leaned over to look. Wanda held a picture of her and Nat. Nat was standing behind a smiling Wanda, arms wrapped around Wanda’s waist, kissing her on the cheek, “We were maybe 20 here. This is before I met your father. Your aunt and I had just started dating, and we were at a party that Aunt Aggie was throwing for some show or movie.” She flipped to the next picture, all three women, Nat and Wanda were looking at each other like they were the only two people in the world who existed, and Agatha was making a gagging motion.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Again, before I met your father, a house party at another actor’s house,” Another picture, this one of Wanda and Nat kissing. Both women turned bright red, “Self-explanatory.” The next picture was of her and Vision, when they had announced their engagement. They were both smiling, but hers didn’t quite meet her eyes and she looked like she would cry. She looked at her husband, “I’m so sorry…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision shook his head, “I knew what I was signing up for, darling,” He said as he squeezed her knee. If a more understanding and patient man existed in the world, Wanda wasn’t sure how.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There were two pictures left. One was the leaked picture of her and Nat kissing at The Killers concert. The other was one she remembered well. Agatha had taken it. They had lived in the clubhouse at the time, and she and Nat were sitting on the couch, facing each other, fingers locked together, when their eyes met and Nat had told Wanda that she loved her for the first time. A tear ran down Wanda’s cheek as she looked at the boys, “This is the first time your Aunt Nat told me she loved me.” Nat wiped the tear from Wanda’s cheek as Vision sniffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy and Tommy nodded. “Why? Why the secrecy and all this?” Billy asked. “We looked up some things online. There are a lot of theories, but we think we deserve to know the truth.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. “You do.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision looked at the two women next to him and then back to the boys. “While this is your mother’s story to tell, I want you both to know that if anyone is the victim here, it’s your mother and your aunt. The industry was very cruel and hypocritical. It celebrated Agatha because she came out at a younger age and it added to her persona. I knew all along, and your mother made a very difficult decision. We love each other very much, just in a different way, and everything we’ve done has been for the two of you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys both nodded. Wanda squeezed Vision’s hand. He really was a great husband and father. She looked at the boys and took a deep breath. “I fell in love with Nat years before I met your father…” She told them a child-friendly version of the story and brought them up to speed, including how they had decided to divorce and were preparing to tell them after the holidays.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, you and Aunt Nat have been having an affair for 20 years?” Tommy asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “While you’re still 14 and it’s not your business, no, we have not. Vows have not been broken, well, if kissing isn’t breaking vows,” Wanda answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I told your mother she could,” Vision answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have always respected your parents' marriage,” Nat added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy grimaced, but he did think it was sweet to a degree. “So you were planning a divorce but were waiting to tell us?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We wanted to wait until after the holidays. We weren’t sure how you boys would take it,” Wanda looked at them both with motherly concern.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Dad, you’re okay with all of this?” Tommy looked at Vision.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “When you truly love someone, you realize that you want them to be happy. Plus, your mother and I have been best friends for much longer than we’ve been anything else.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, is everyone okay with this? No hard feelings, no custody battles, and we’re still going to be a cohesive family. Dad might live somewhere else, and Mom will eventually marry Aunt Nat?” Tommy looked at all three adults.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes,” All three answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Both twins grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “In that case, Eddie and I are dating. Moms, dad, I’m gay.” Billy announced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No shit, son.” Nat laughed.

      The week had gone by quickly, and Agatha would be at Rio’s door in a few minutes to pick her up. Rio was nervous, though she wasn’t completely sure as to why. It was Agatha, her friend, her…potential girlfriend? Okay, that was a tad scary, and they would probably be all over Page Six by morning, Twitter, BlueSky, Tumblr…she wasn’t used to that either. This was LA, celebrities were everywhere, but Agatha Harkness was never seen out on an actual date, and Rio hadn’t gone out in public with the ex. They knew that even if they didn’t make a verbal or published statement, they would be making a visual one. It was dinner, and then Agatha had some surprise for her. She wasn’t sure what they would be doing on the second Saturday night of November, but she was up for anything as long as she was doing it with Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She touched up her dark red lipstick and walked through the apartment into the living room. She wore a long-sleeve green v-cut blouse and black pencil skirt with knee-high black boots, with her hair in large curls around her shoulders, “Alright Raven, here goes everything,” She said to the sleeping cat on the couch, who barely stirred as there was a knock on the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As often as Rio had seen Agatha in a suit, she still never tired of it. The woman looked stunning in them, and she knew it. This particular suit was black and fitted with a purple vest, no shirt, and purple stiletto heels. Agatha Fucking Harkness, indeed. Rio ran her eyes up and down Agatha twice before she even realized she had one foot propped on a box.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What is that?” Rio asked, “And what’s with the stance there, Captain Morgan?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This,” Agatha picked up the box and walked dramatically past Rio. “Is for the woman of the house. M’Lady,” she presented the box to Raven, who woke up and sniffed at it curiously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio walked over to look at the box herself and laughed. “Did you buy her a fancy automatic feeder for wet food?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, I did. I’m tired of you running off at the unholy hour of seven in the morning on Sundays, and Alice can’t always pop over here. Besides, she and Jen will eventually move in together,” Agatha walked off towards the kitchen to figure out the gadget, Raven on her heels.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It took them nearly a decade to start dating. I don’t think they’ll U-Haul it anytime soon. And mighty presumptuous of you to think I’ll still stay the night on Saturdays.” Rio followed them into the kitchen, ready to watch Agatha set up Raven’s new contraption.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We start dating and you stop spending the night? Isn’t that backwards?” She smirked as she opened and immediately discarded the directions on the counter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes, “Why does it not surprise me that you don’t read directions?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t make it this far following the rules, sweetcheeks. Hand me your phone.” Agatha held her hand out for Rio’s phone as she plugged in the feeder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not unlocking it for you.” Rio raised an eyebrow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is this a test?” Agatha didn’t take her eyes off Rio as she unlocked Rio’s phone and downloaded an app, “You can control this thing from your phone. Will you hand me Her Highness’s food, please? I know you already have it portioned and ready to go for the morning.” She looked down at Raven, who was pawing at Agatha’s hand as she petted her, “I also know you’ve been fed for the night already, but nice try.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was impressed as she handed Raven’s breakfast to Agatha. The older woman put the food in the tray, closed the lid, and programmed the time in Rio’s phone before handing it back to her. “You can put up to six meals in it. It keeps everything cold and fresh, the app controls everything, or you can program it on here.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was impressed. No one had ever used Raven to their advantage before, and Agatha hadn’t even read the instructions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You watched a video, didn’t you, Harkness?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I will never reveal my secrets.” She stood up in one fluid motion and took Rio’s hand, kissing its back. “Now that I’ve won Raven over, are you ready to go?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You mean you aren’t just trying to woo the cat?” Rio looked at her playfully, “Yes, let me grab my bag, and we’ll go.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The restaurant had been one of LA’s celebrity hotspots, though Rio really didn’t mind. She liked the atmosphere, the food was great, and she was there with Agatha. That was not the important part of this date, nor was it what she had been looking forward to. It was what came afterward, the surprise that Agatha had been hinting at all week. They were back at the car, and Rio was surprised to see that Agatha’s driver was not there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wait, Agatha, are YOU driving? I don’t think I’ve ever actually seen you drive.” Rio said with a mixture of shock and hesitation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio. I am 51 years old. I drive. Get in the car.” She smiled as she got into the driver’s seat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, I’m just not used to it. Why are you driving?” She asked, eyebrow raised with suspicion. “Are we doing something illegal?” She buckled her seatbelt, still confused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Maybe I’d like us to be completely alone? Maybe it’s a secret. Maybe we’re going on a bank heist.” Agatha threw out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were driving up the Pacific Coastal Highway, away from the city, and Rio could see more of the sky and the stars than usual. She reached over and ran her fingers through Agatha’s hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am trying to focus on driving,” Agatha said as she reached over with her right hand and placed it on Rio’s thigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Both hands on the wheel, Harkness,” Rio instructed, trying not to smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha ignored her, smirking instead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes, “Where are you taking me?” They had exited the highway and were on a dirt road.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Secret lair, very secluded. I plan on seducing and torturing you, might murder you, might not. We’ll see what happens,” Agatha kept a straight face in the way only she could.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This is why you have so many awards. If I didn’t know better, I would have believed you. Also, I might be game.” Rio put her hand on Agatha’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Who said I was acting? We will, however, revisit some of what you’re game for in the future,” Agatha cleared her throat, as it was suddenly dry, “Oh look, we’re here.” Agatha had turned into some type of parking lot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Where are we?” Rio asked, looking around, confused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You tell me, mad scientist.” Agatha was practically bouncing from excitement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked around and then looked up at where they could see the sky, free from light pollution before looking back at Agatha. “Aggie, what’s in the back of the car?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I thought you’d never ask,” Agatha dramatically flounced to the back of the SUV, opening the back as she went, pulling out a telescope with a shit-eating grin on her face. “I heard you like stars and sciencey shit.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You brought me to a national park, away from everything, with a giant ass telescope, by ourselves, on the night of a meteor shower, for our first date?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I did.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And you haven’t been on a proper date in years?” At this point, Rio didn’t understand why Agatha was single.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have not.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio could see the delight in Agatha’s eyes at her amazement and surprise. She had seen everything Agatha had ever been in and couldn’t recall a scene like this so she knew that either one of their friends had tipped her off or she really was just this thoughtful. If she wasn’t already under Agatha’s spell, she was now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha handed Rio the telescope “I believe this is your department,” before pulling out a blanket and a tote bag. “Follow me.” She strutted across the uneven ground, still in stilettos in only the way Agatha could.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes dropped to appreciate the view of Agatha in front of her, “Gladly.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha led them to a small clearing not far from where they had parked, laying out the blanket, and pulling out two thermos’ of cocoa as Rio set up the telescope and dialed it in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did you bring hot chocolate, you Girl Scout?” Rio laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I played a Girl Scout as a kid, and yes I did. It’s chilly and I’m driving, celebrities and DUI’s don’t mix.” Agatha handed her a thermos as she joined her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha Harkness, an adorable romantic, who knew?” Rio noted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m full of surprises.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So am I,” She peered through the lenses before standing up and motioning for Agatha to look. “See those two stars by the moon?” Agatha nodded, “That’s Jupiter and Mars. Now if you look over here,” Rio shifted the telescope slightly, hand on the small of Agatha’s back, guiding her, “You can see the constellation Phoenix. It has the bright star at the bottom, makes the diamond shape to the north and west, and the triangle to the east.” Rio explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. She knew what a phoenix was, but she could tell that Rio was passionate about the sciences and wanted to listen to her for hours. “Tell me about it?” She stood and looked at her, placing a hand on Rio’s hip and guiding her to lay down on the plush blanket with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before Agatha could lead them down, however, Rio hooked a thumb through one of the belt loops of Agatha’s pants and pulled Agatha against her, looping her other arm around Agatha’s shoulders and slowly slid their lips together, sighing into their kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha parted her lips for Rio immediately, flexing her fingers into her hip, and ran her other thumb along Rio’s jaw. Agatha needed to feel as much skin as she could, as if she had to ensure Rio was real. She whimpered when Rio broke the kiss to guide them to lay down, Agatha’s original intention.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What’s wrong there, slugger?” Rio had a smug look in her eye as she pulled Agatha down and pushed her on her back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know, funny thing. I was kissing this beautiful woman, and suddenly I wasn’t, which is a rare occurrence for me. However, this particular woman has a pattern and it’s maddening.” Agatha was smiling, clearly joking, as she stared into Rio’s eyes and ran one hand up her back, the other twisting in Rio’s hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You mean there’s at least one woman on this planet who manages to have some self-control around the great Agatha Harkness?” Rio teased as she lay halfway on top of Agatha. One arm propped her up as she snaked the other hand inside Agatha’s jacket and under her vest to rest on the bare skin of her side. When Agatha raised one eyebrow at the touch, Rio had just shrugged, saying her hand was cold.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Tell me about the constellations.” Agatha reminded her as she raised her head and kissed Rio again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know you know about phoenixes,” she rolled her eyes, as Agatha had been compared to the mythological bird many times, “but, the myth is that when the bird dies, it rises from the ashes and begins anew. An oversimplification, which you know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hummed her admittance. “You’re a phoenix yourself, kid. Giving this,” she gestured between them, “ a shot after what happened. Thank you, for trusting me.” She traced Rio’s jawline, meeting her for another kiss, this one longer, deeper, more meaningful. Agatha held Rio by the nape of her neck and waist. As Rio’s hand on Agatha’s skin tightened its grip, her other hand instinctively found its way to Agatha’s hair. Agatha’s tongue flicked across Rio’s lip as she nipped it with her teeth before she ran her tongue along Rio’s own, the roof of her mouth, the back of her teeth, anywhere she could reach. The only time she even slightly broke from Rio was so they could breathe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled so that she was on top of Rio, their bodies pressed together, deepening the kiss. She knew they were the only ones in the park, a perk of being Agatha Fucking Harkness. Rio’s hands had moved inside Agatha’s jacket, exploring her back and grateful Agatha had opted against a shirt under the vest, as Agatha moved from Rio’s mouth, kissing down her jawline and drew her earlobe into her mouth. Rio moaned as Agatha dragged her nails across her collarbone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha.” Rio breathed. She was flooded with heat and wanted this to continue, but knew it couldn’t, especially not outside, on the ground, not with Agatha like this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mmm?” Agatha was kissing down her neck like she was on a mission, and she was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We have to stop.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had withdrawn her hands and put them both on Agatha’s chest, itching to put them lower, even though that was a bad idea. She looked down at Agatha as the other brunette put an end to her mission and came back up to give Rio a chaste kiss on the lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded and rolled onto her back, pulling Rio back to her side as a star shot across the sky. Yes, Rio was right. They hadn’t rushed anything else, so why rush this? Agatha could be patient and Rio was worth it, she was worth everything, and she would prove to Rio that no matter what Rio believed, she had been put in a terrible situation by a psychopathic bitch, but that didn’t mean anything was wrong with Rio, far from it. She had lived a life where things had happened TO her, not BECAUSE of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They lay there as the stars fell around them, Rio educating Agatha about the names of meteor showers, this particular one being the Orionids, their causes, and pointing out more constellations as they kissed during silent pauses, played with each other’s hair and held hands. Agatha had never had this with anyone and drunk it all in. She felt peaceful, removed from watchful eyes, the weight of fame, knowing that the woman beside her saw her for who she was. Agatha the person, not Agatha the star. She watched Rio talk as she came to a stop and turned towards Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What is it? You’re looking at me all weird, do I have a big bug on my face?” She asked, not even moving to swat at the imaginary insect.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head. “I just appreciate you,” She looked up at the sky, “What’s your ‘wish upon a star’ there, princess?” Agatha said, deflecting to her sarcastic humor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       That you would finish revealing yourself to me. That I would let myself love you. That you would fall in love with me.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Rio couldn’t bring herself to say any of that, instead, she went with something safe, “That you’d finish out your triple EGOT.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha breathed a laugh, “Please. Your falling rock wish is not for me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It is, but not to win an award.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      “It is!” She argued as Agatha gave her a look. “Okay, fine, for Raven to live forever.” That was not a lie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That I actually do believe,” Agatha affirmed. “Mine is not to lose the people close to me.”
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       You, specifically.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She revealed. “It’s getting colder. Are you ready to go back?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Stay the night with me?” Agatha asked in a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s Saturday, of course,” Rio whispered back as she kissed Agatha again. She had waited to kiss Agatha for months, and now she got to do it freely. Somewhere, past Rio was deceased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Agatha drove them back to the compound, she considered their sleeping arrangements. They had shared a bed, but never her actual bed at her main residence, not even the previous weekend when they had kissed for the first time, Rio still opting for the couch. Come to think of it, she had never shared that bed with anyone that she didn’t consider family. It was intimate and a big deal, but she was letting Rio drive this at her speed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Where exactly are we sleeping tonight darling?” Agatha asked, trying not to sound shady.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Your house.” Rio gave nothing in her answer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Where in my house?” Agatha prodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew how to push Agatha’s buttons and she had fun doing it. “A room, preferably on a horizontal surface.” She grinned as she placed her hand on Agatha’s upper thigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Smartass,” Agatha mumbled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
</span>
</em>
<span>
      Rio turned slightly serious, “If it’s okay with you, sweetheart, your bed, in your room, in your arms,” Rio gave Agatha another bright smile, “I’m wearing clothes though. If you’re good, we can continue that, ehm, conversation we started under the stars.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha loved Rio’s smile, returning one of her own as she slid her hand up Rio’s thigh, slightly under the hem of her skirt, “I can be good.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed as her phone dinged.

      Agatha lay in bed staring in amazement at Rio in her arms, breathing peacefully. Normally, Rio would have been gone by now, having gone home to feed the main gal in her life. Agatha needed to find the inventors of that darn auto feeder and hug them. Rio already had a camera that she used to check in on the senior citizen periodically, or else that would have been the next purchase. Agatha had always been tactile with her friends but never with romantic or sexual partners. Her ex hadn’t liked Agatha being touchy, so she hadn’t been. Agatha had been kept secret, and so they’d been secretive. Not Rio. No, they’d always touched, and now that they were in solid ‘more than friends’ territory, they were rarely apart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha considered getting up and making breakfast, but she didn’t want to move Rio, nor did she want to break the contact. Instead, she kissed her forehead, her cheek, her nose, and any place she could with her limited range of motion. She needed to confess everything to Rio, the complete story, before falling even further for her. She pushed that aside for now. She could control that and just would shut that part of her off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stirred, opening her eyes halfway. “Mornin’,” She said with a yawn before she nuzzled into Agatha’s shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good Morning.” Agatha kissed Rio on the top of the head, bringing her closer. “Sleep okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “I’m sleeping here more from now on. Your bed is more comfortable than mine.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The bed, or me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Both.” Rio rolled away and stretched. “Seriously though, a girl could get used to this, Agatha, better be careful. She winked as she got out of the bed. “Now, come make breakfast with me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While Rio’s admission scared Agatha, she also found herself wanting Rio to wake up beside her every morning.

      Rio was ignoring the sociopathic elephant on her phone. It was two texts. Nothing was going to happen, so SF knew they had gone stargazing Saturday night. Big deal. She had done this before, pinging her phone for her location in some third-party app, even once having a private inspector follow her. If anything else like that happened, she would wipe her phone and just watch herself better. She had a few more months until the restraining order expired, it would be fine. What Rio was more concerned about was the fact that the cat was out of the bag. Photos from dinner were all over the internet. That, coupled with the premiere and pictures from New York, people were doing the math. Her first name had even been leaked, and they had a hashtag.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha Harkness seen out on the town with new friend, ‘Rio’”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Third Rio sighting! Is it serious, or are they just friends?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just gals being pals!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “With ‘My Beloved’ nominated for the Grammy for Movie Theme Song, do you think Agatha will take her?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She won’t last until February.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “#Wagatha or #Agathario?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We have to find out her last name, surely #Agathario is not the best we can do!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This from the people that gave us #WandaNat for Wanda and her bodyguard.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because their last names literally form THEIR LAST NAMES.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I ship them now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s temporary.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I heard Agatha was making out with some woman at a club last week.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Vision, surrounded by lesbians, including his own wife.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “#WandaVision forever!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s not even that pretty.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio groaned as she put her phone down, straightened, and got the papers together that she needed for her first class of the day. It was Monday, and there were still two weeks until Thanksgiving break. She didn’t have Nicky until her fifth period but had Tommy first and Billy third. The bell rang as students filed in, strangely quiet for her class. “Guys?” She looked at them all. “What’s going on?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her room of 15 freshman biology students looked at each other sheepishly before her eyes landed on Tommy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Tommy, tell me.” She instructed as he turned bright red. The team had won on Friday night and would be advancing to the Division Championship game on Friday, so she wasn’t sure why students were quiet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I told everyone you and Aunt Aggie were seeing each other, but not together…” He started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She nodded. The collective wanted the gossip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A teacher’s private life is not your business.” She smirked as they groaned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ms. Vidal, our parents are famous. We’re going to hear about it anyway.” Monica, Carol Danvers’s daughter, said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s true…” Rio said as she thought it over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We all know the drama from last year.” Another student added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Some of us live on the compound,” Tommy mentioned to laughter from his classmates.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio grinned. “Might as well come from the primary source, then. Tommy is right. Ms. Harkness and I went on a date. We are not together as reported. We have been friends all year, happy?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ms. Jones is going to be upset,” America Chavez shook her head. Rio had been handing out study materials and stopped, waiting for America to continue, “Surely you know about everything from last year, Ms. Vidal? A lot of the teachers were…involved, with Agatha. Ms. Jones was absolutely in love with her.” America finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tommy rolled his eyes. “Ms. Jones was just another in a long line of hookups, everyone was. Ri…Ms. Vidal is the real deal.” He defended Rio, and she smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, well, let’s look at your study guide for your upcoming unit test, please.” She redirected, knowing that this set would spread the word.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Teaching at SHIELD was not for the faint of heart, with students who were on top of all the celebrity gossip running around. That was also how she found out that Carol Danvers had won ‘first kiss on Halloween’, Coach Rogers had ‘Vidal freaks out’, Lilia for their date last Saturday, but not actually dating. Wanda felt like she had an unfair advantage because she knew Rio’s past. Rio and Nat had been filled in on the previous Stalker situation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio ran into Jessica Jones, a middle school math teacher, in the teacher’s lounge.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You won’t last, you know.” Jessica spat, seething. Rio just shrugged, wanting to avoid the confrontation, and went to Alice’s classroom instead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I did not expect drama,” Rio said, sitting on top of a table and eating her lunch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked at her. “Agatha has slept with her very unfair share of women, Ri. What did you expect?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged, “I don’t know, but it wasn’t students prying, other teachers being jealous, the men high-fiving me…Rogers fucking HUGGED me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice started laughing. “Yeah, because Peggy has a thing for Agatha, and he’s glad she’s off the market.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked skeptical, “Peggy is pregnant.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If you were pregnant, married to a man, and Agatha Fucking Harkness hit on you, would you turn her down, even if you were, to quote the late, great Lorna Wu, tragically straight?” Alice gestured to the sky as she mentioned her mother.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio grinned. “Oh, absolutely not.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Where is your girlfriend this week?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s not my girlfriend. Agatha is filming this week and next/shut down for Thanksgiving, two more weeks in the US. Shut down for Christmas and the New Year, and then Canada in January.” Rio checked the clock to ensure she had a few minutes before class.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You still knew who I was talking about, though.” Alice pointed out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Whatever. Speaking of, any updates on your front?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked down, chewing on the inside of her cheek. Rio’s eyes widened. “Shit, I was teasing. Has something changed?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Umm, Jen asked me to move in with her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “WHAT? It took you two a fucking decade to make a move, and now you’re going all in?” Rio was trying very hard not to shout. “I’m assuming her house?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shook her head. “We’re thinking of buying a house or even building.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio brought her voice down a notch, “Holy shit, Alice. That’s a lot. Are you sure.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s been ten years. We haven’t been together until recently, but my feelings were there, and I feel like there’s lost time. I accidentally blurted out that I loved her last week.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn’t put her feelings for Agatha into words, and Alice and Jen had gone into hyperdrive. “What did she say?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She loves me too,” Alice smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lesbians,” Rio smiled and shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, so, catch the fuck up,” Alice said as the bell rang.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      On Wednesday, Rio received flowers at school that Lilia personally brought to Rio’s classroom at the end of her fifth period, AP Chemistry, which one Nicky Harkness was in. Twelve sets of eyes were on her as she took the beautiful and tasteful bouquet of blue, pink, and purple hydrangeas, blue and pink azaleas, purple violets, and lavender. Her cheeks were tinged with pink as the teenagers’ “oohs” and “awws” filled the room, and a few of them ribbed Nicky about how his mom had game. The bell rang, and the students left the room as Lilia stood there, eyebrows raised at Lilia. With a wink at Rio, Nicky had grabbed a beaker, filled it with water, stole three pink hydrangeas, and jogged out of the room, calling after Morgan Stark. Rio couldn’t help but smile after the boy she loved like her own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia walked over and shut the door before turning back to Rio. “I know I encouraged this Rio, and I do. I expect the drama to be kept to a minimum. That said, I expect this to end much better than your last relationship. As long as you’re completely honest and you confront any issues head-on. Have a good week, Ms. Vidal. It’s almost Thanksgiving!” She left, and Rio just stood there before reading the card.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know the next few weeks are busy, but I wanted to let you know I miss you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took a picture of her flowers and sent it to the coven before texting Agatha.
     </span>

      Agatha was in between takes as she sat in a chair with her name on the back. She was filming for her new TV show. She knew the question was silly, but she wanted the confirmation.

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t have the traditional school experience growing up, but she imagined this was what passing the ‘do you like me’ notes was like. She was blushing and knew she looked like she had a school-girl crush right now. She didn’t care. She took a screenshot of the conversation and sent it to Wanda, who told her she was a child.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was smiling at the confirmation that Agatha Harkness liked her as if it hadn’t been blatantly obvious.
     </span>
</p>

      Agatha put her phone down. She couldn’t remember a time in her life when she smiled this much. Rio was talking about handling Nicky’s dating life together, and her heart had soared. She didn’t want to unpack that right now. At the same time, she felt guilty for not coming clean.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat was helping Wanda run lines when the picture of the flowers showed up in the group chat. Wanda and Nat looked at each other and smiled.. Jen sighed and jotted down notes about future statements while browsing real estate listings. Alice had already known, as some of her sixth-period students had been in Rio’s fifth period.

      It was another Friday night, and another football game at SHIELD. Lilia ‘Just Keep the Secrets and Keep the Kids Alive’ Calderu was trying her best to keep the media at bay, the lesbian drama to a minimum, the elementary school holiday pageants were coming up, and the secondary school musical was right after Thanksgiving. Then she had parents gambling on one of her teacher's love lives with Agatha Harkness and the usual teenage hormones to deal with. She deserved a vacation, and if it wasn’t for her own affinity to once sleep with parents, and now grandparents, of students, she would consider a no fraternizing policy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Agatha were holding hands in public at a high school football game. Elementary parents who didn’t have high school students involved in the game ran the concessions, so she and the coven were free to watch the whole time. It was half-time, and SHIELD was losing to Bayside of all teams. Rio was walking back from the restroom when Jessica Jones confronted her for the second time that week.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know you’re just temporary, Vidal.” She said, looking her up and down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Jessica, I have no issue with you. I’m sorry things didn’t work out between the two of you.” Rio was trying to be cordial. She didn’t like confrontation or drama.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha came up beside Rio, wrapping a protective arm around her waist. She was wearing a gold and black SHIELD beanie and a letterman jacket with Harkness on the back and looked every bit the proud mom she was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hi, babe.” She said to Rio, kissing her on the cheek. She was making a very bold statement, and she knew it. “Hi Jessica, nice to see you supporting the team.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jessica turned bright red, “Hello, Agatha. Nicky’s been great this year.” Jessica was somewhere between embarrassed and shocked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha regarded her, eyes narrow, face somewhat severe. Rio loved it. She knew Agatha was sending a clear, nonverbal message, and it sent a chill down her spine. The woman that famously didn’t date and that left women longing in her wake, was letting someone know that she had chosen Rio and to alert the masses. It was like some type of lesbian standoff, and Jessica was the first to break.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m happy for both of you,” Jessica said finally before she nodded at Agatha and stalked off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned and laughed. “How do you do that? Just mind control women?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Again, not giving away my secret,” She kissed Rio quickly on the mouth, seeing her surprise. “Is it okay that I kiss you at school? I should’ve asked that first.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, “Everyone else kisses there…whatever.” Not sure what to call Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Got it.” She led Rio back to where they were sitting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda had witnessed everything as she Venmo’d Pepper for ‘staking claims at the football game.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had also witnessed everything and just hoped that was the end of the teacher drama.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      SHIELD lost the game, and their playoff run was over. Bayside rubbed it in a bit too much. Nat wanted to punch the principal in the face and rip his toupee off, ever the protective mom she was. While there were tears, the students were also excited that they had made it as far as they had in sports. In a flurry of emotion, Billy had gone up to Eddie and kissed him full on the mouth in front of everyone. Wanda, through tears at seeing the boys lose, took a picture and sent it to Eddie’s parents. Billy was proud of his boyfriend as he had caught one of Nicky’s passes for a touchdown. He had also fumbled a ball but wasn’t focused on that part. Morgan Stark had told Nicky he did a good job and asked if he was busy the next night and if he wanted to come over and watch a movie. Pepper promised Agatha that SHE would be the one to supervise and that she would send Tony over to Coach Rogers's house. Vision gave Tommy a pep talk about how they couldn’t win them all.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn’t until they got home that the adults realized how crushed their souls were. Tommy was mad and blaming the refs, as Vision waxed poetic about defeat, and the redheads had to tell him this wasn’t the best time for philosophy. Meanwhile, Agatha reassured Nicky that he had done the absolute best he could and that it really was not his fault.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If I had just called better plays, Mom!” He was full of regret and blamed himself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh honey, even the greatest players don’t win every game. You are sixteen years old, and you did a great job. I am so proud of you,” They were sitting on the couch and she ran a hand through his hair. He was six foot tall now to her five foot five. They had to sit so she could reach the top of his head. “I love you so much, Nicholas,” she wrapped her arms around his shoulders. He would always be her little boy, no matter how old he was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mom?” He sniffled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, baby?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can I ask you something, and you be completely honest with me?” He knew his mother and knew she spoke in half-truths.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s a scary question, but yes. I promise to be completely honest.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you love Rio?” He sounded like a little boy, and she knew why he was asking. He needed to know if Rio was permanent. His mother had never dated anyone during his life, and this was new to him. He had to know if he could be vulnerable with Rio. If he could let her in and get close to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Honest answer, kid? I don’t know.” She had feelings for Rio, she knew that much, but she honestly didn’t know if she was capable of loving someone again. She couldn’t even bring herself to tell Rio about that part of her life, she was still so damaged, and it had ended eighteen years ago.
     </span>
</p>

      “I think it’s possible? I don’t know. I’m new to all this. I don’t want that to change or influence how you treat or act around her, though. Do not keep her at arm's length because I don’t know how to handle big feelings, okay?” Nicky was already forming a close bond with Rio, and she didn’t want to ruin that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky looked at his mom, the emotional idiot that she was. “You look at her the way Aunt Wanda looks at Aunt Nat, you know,”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She scoffed, “I absolutely do not.” she lied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He gave her a small smile, “Mom, to borrow your favorite f-word, please don’t fuck this up.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She couldn’t help but smile at her son, “I’m not even mad that you swore.”

      The next night was movie night, and Agatha and Rio were on their own having a date night at Rio’s. They were making comments on some cheesy lesbian Christmas movie as Rio lay with her head in Agatha’s lap when Agatha’s phone dinged with a text from Jen.

      “Perfect. Just taking care of something real quick,” She widened her smile. She was bursting at the seams with the surprise but had to text Lilia first.

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked down at Rio, grinning from ear to ear, tugging her hair to get her attention.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked up at her with a questioning look. “You look like you’re about to tell me we’re all mad here.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We are, but no. What are you doing December 8th?” Agatha asked her, knowing the answer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Watching a grainy livestream of the final Taylor Swift show.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How would you like to be there in a VIP tent, with me and the rest of the coven?” Agatha tried to remain composed, but she could not.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrieked as she sat up. “WHAT?! Really!? YES!” She threw her arms around Agatha and kissed her, pulling back as reality hit, “Wait, that’s a school night.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You and Alice will have subs. Just took care of it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrieked again, kissing Agatha. “I promise I like you for you and not just the perks.” She said after pausing for a breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed, leaning into Rio, “I didn’t doubt that for a second.” Agatha knew Rio never expected anything. She just liked making Rio smile, no matter what it took.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The moment was broken when there was a knock on the door. Agatha raised an eyebrow, “Expecting someone?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, you know, just one of my many other megastar suitors,” Rio joked, opening the door to another bouquet sitting in the otherwise empty hallway. She picked them up and turned around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Babe, more flowers? I’m going to run out of room.” She huffed a laugh as she closed the door and turned to kiss Agatha, who had come up behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was not smiling. “Rio, those aren’t from me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stilled as Agatha guided her back to the couch. Rio looked at the flowers, brain quickly working.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “All flowers have multiple meanings, positive and negative,” She mumbled aloud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. She had looked up every single flower she had sent Rio, since Alice warned her that Rio would dissect it like this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio went on, “Calla lilies, my least favorite, rebirth and union. Marigolds can symbolize jealousy, as can yellow roses, which can also symbolize possession. Red roses stand for love, of course, but these…” Rio looked at their rich color. “These mean obsession. The dark orchids for mystery and possession, and white lilies for obsession and mourning.” Her voice was devoid of all emotion. She hadn’t even read the card yet they both knew what this meant. Both women just stared at the offending flowers as if they would come alive at any moment and swallow them both whole.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes landed on the card as she reached a shaky hand towards it. Agatha took her hand and met her eyes. “Together?” Agatha asked. Rio nodded as they took the card. Rio let out the breath she was holding as they opened it. She froze as she took in the words in the all too familiar handwriting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have movie night every Saturday too, watching the movies we made.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The blood in Rio’s veins turned to ice and she forgot how to breathe. Agatha threw the card down as if it had burst into flames.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m gathering everyone. NOW.” Agatha said, venom in her voice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. “No, this is my problem. No one else has to get involved.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh yes, the hell we can.” Agatha was on the move. “This fucking bitch. Who the fuck does she think she is?” She stopped when she saw the fear in Rio’s eyes. Agatha dropped down to her knees in front of Rio. Agatha put one hand on Rio’s knee and the other on her cheek. “Trust me?” She asked, eyes pleading. Agatha couldn’t confront her feelings, nor could she confess everything, but she could do this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, tears filling her eyes. Out of all the people she knew, Agatha was the third person in her life who had seen her cry this much. “I do,” Rio replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pulled out her phone and sent a text to the group chat. All it said was ‘my house, 911.’ She pulled Rio into a gentle kiss, wiping away her tears. “Pack yours and Raven’s shit. You both are staying at my house for a few days.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Rio were the last to arrive at the compound, and tensions were high as the other women met them in the driveway. Rio parked so they could help unload.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How much does this cat need?” Nat asked, grabbing the autofeeder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s our niece you’re talking about.” Wanda tried to lighten the mood. She knew it had to be serious if Agatha had made both of them come.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Ten minutes later, once everyone was settled and Raven was roaming the house, all eyes were on Rio and Agatha as they sat in the living room as if it was any other Saturday night. Agatha was in protective mode with both arms around the younger woman. “Floor’s all yours. Don’t worry, I’m with you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio exhaled deeply as she looked at Nat and Wanda. “Did Agatha tell you about the stalker situation?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. “Briefly, yes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, she reached out today.” As she pointed at the flowers they had brought with them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat automatically checked them for tracking devices or bugs, finding none.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There was this too.” She flinched as she tossed the card on the table for the other four women to read.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned in to whisper in Rio’s ear, “Jen knew before I did?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was ranting to Alice, and it came up, and she was there, so yes.” Rio looked at Agatha apologetically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wasn’t completely sure how to feel about Jen knowing about SF first, but it made sense. They turned back towards the others.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So can we assume that these are not family-friendly movies?” Wanda asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed. She had many regrets, and those videos were among her biggest ones. “She hated that we couldn’t be public and that was one of her ways to make it up to me,” Rio explained, voice small.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It was a manipulation and future blackmail technique,” Jen gulped straight vodka. She sympathized with her friend, she did, but she also saw the potential scandal.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave her a scathing look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If anything happens, we’ll deal with it. This isn’t the time to worry about reputations, Jennifer.” Agatha said with a biting tone. Jen jumped a little at the use of her given name.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Damn, using your full name,” Alice remarked as she rubbed her girlfriend's thigh with one hand and put her other hand over Jen’s mouth, looking around the room. “What we need to do right now is worry about how to head this off. I know this bitch. This is a thinly veiled threat.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded. “I’m having my tech girl look into the cameras at Rio and Alice’s place. Those flowers were hand-delivered.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. “No, SF is good. She is too smart to come herself. She probably paid some rando outside to bring it. No, you wouldn’t have caught that either. She likely knows where all the cameras are. She may or may not have a past.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha huffed a laugh, “So, what you’re saying is, you have a type?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A small smile tugged at Rio’s lips before disappearing when Nat confirmed what Rio had said about disabling cameras. “Darcy just texted. Even worse, all the cameras in your building went down for a few minutes this evening.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked up at Rio, “You have to tell us who she is.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked at Rio as Rio shook her head. “No, some of you have too much to risk. Only the bare minimum people need to know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded and motioned towards Agatha’s brag room, “Just me then, come on.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed Rio’s cheek. “Go,” she lightly nudged her off the couch as Rio rose and followed Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Three sets of eyes landed on Alice as she shook her head, “I’m not telling any of you anything.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat directed Rio into the room and closed the door behind them, looking expectantly towards Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wrapped her arms around herself. “What do you know about models?” She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They’re hot and vapid?” Nat responded, trying to make Rio laugh, which worked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, yes. What do you know about Lou Falco?” Rio asked, looking down at her foot as she flexed her toes nervously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat’s eyes went wide. “Lou Falco, former Victoria’s Secret model? Married to former football player turned broadcaster/actor Shane Falco? Lesbian rumors for years, Lou Falco? OH GOD, YOU WERE THE RUMORED SECRET GIRLFRIEND?!” The pieces were falling into place for Nat as her eyes grew wider.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio clapped a hand over Nat’s mouth. “Quiet down, Sherlock. Yes, I was. But, now, there’s a restraining order.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat licked her palm and grinned when Rio grimaced and wiped it on her jeans. “Gross.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s going to have high-powered lawyers, but not as high-powered as Wagatha’s. When does the order expire?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “December 31st, 11:59 P.M.” Rio recited.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This is the first time she’s done anything?” Nat asked, looking at Rio intently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave a quick nod, not giving anything away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m going to dust the vase for prints, but she’s brilliant, went to an Ivy League, and never got caught for her small run of burglaries. I don’t expect to find even an eyelash.” Nat thought out loud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How do you know about any of that?” Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat smirked, “Have you met me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Right. Spy.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, I’ll take care of it. You’re safe, okay?” Nat knew Rio was worried, and this was Nat’s job. “You’re staying here for a few days, and I’ll let you know when everything’s okay.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio threw her arms around the smaller woman, “Thank you so much, Natasha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat hugged her back and smiled. She would always protect these women. It was who she was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They returned to the main room. Rio returned to Agatha’s side as Nat grabbed the tainted flowers and the card and walked out, Wanda on her heels.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at Agatha, eyebrows raised, “So, what’s the battle plan in case this goes terribly?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned her eyes to Raven as the cat hopped on her lap. “We go with plan R,” She was only half joking.

      Nat left for a few days, and everyone was on edge, especially Wanda. This is what Natasha did. She took care of the darker parts of fame, but that didn’t make things easier, especially now that they were on the precipice of finally beginning a proper life together. Vision came gliding through the room and stopped when he saw Wanda, leaning against the kitchen island, staring wistfully at her phone. The boys were at school, and he was on his way out the door to teach a class.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nat will be perfectly fine,” he had been briefed on the situation and was trying to be every bit the emotional support human that he was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I just worry. She’s not twenty-five anymore,” Wanda knew Nat was still in amazing shape, and her lack of height was useful for sneaking around, but without knowing what she was planning, or who the other woman even was, her anxiety was on high alert.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision put a comforting hand on her shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Natasha Romanov can run circles around men half her age. When she’s eighty, she will still be able to take down CIA agents at the top of their game. She will always come back to you, darling. I have no doubt.” He kissed the top of her head as he grabbed his bag for school. Wanda sighed as she looked after him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Vis?” She said tentatively.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, dear?” he half turned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I really am…” She trailed off as he smiled and put up a hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not. Nothing has changed between us when you think about it.” He waved as he walked out of the door.

      Nat burned her disguise underneath an unmarked bridge. She still got a thrill when she got to do the super shady things. They were so rare these days. She had sent quite the message to Lou, all verbal, and had made sure she wasn’t tracked, no physical evidence. She made sure that Lou knew to back off and leave Rio and Agatha alone, or she’d be leaking divorce documents, custody orders, things that could ruin her career and reputation. She’d also visit the ex-husband. She would never see her children again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat had saved the ‘I will make you disappear, and they will never find the body’ speech. She didn’t think she needed it.

      Lou looked at the window the pretty brute had slipped out of. It hadn’t been the first time someone had tried to intimidate her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This one made a simple but important miscalculation. It was silly to think Lou cared about her kids more than Rio. Rio was the most important thing in her life.

      Rio had enjoyed staying with Agatha for the few days it took Nat to take care of the Lou situation. When Nicky had come back to the house from Morgan Stark’s, he had taken one look at Raven and asked where the cat had come from. Those two were fast friends, and when Rio and Raven returned to Rio’s apartment Wednesday evening, Rio wasn’t sure who of the four of them was more upset about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky had Raven in his arms, and the big blue eyes he inherited from his mother were focused on Rio. “Does she have to go?” He pleaded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sorry, kid.” Something Rio was quickly picking up from Agatha, “We’re a package deal. My familiar comes with me.” Raven meowed in agreement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky looked between the two human women, trying to choose the next words carefully, but decided to just go for it, “You’re lesbians. Shouldn’t you be moving in by now? Planning a wedding? Working on giving me a sibling?” He was prepared to run just in case one of them threw hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chose sarcasm. “There’s not a single fast-moving woman in this group, son.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Biology doesn’t work that way, but I can try,” Rio offered, making eyes at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Science, and gross.” Nicky made a gagging sound. He had been prepared for physical swinging, not the verbal kind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes. “Like I didn’t catch you with your tongue down Morgan’s throat this morning.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyebrows almost flew off her head. “Wear a condom. We are not sharing a grandchild with Tony before the two of you graduate.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned to Agatha, “We?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know what I mean.” She mumbled, blushing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you blushing?” Rio rarely saw Agatha blush or get flustered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The teenager took that as his cue, “I’m going to put things in Rio’s car.” He set Raven down and went to load the car.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’re sharing a hypothetical grandchild now?” Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, because he’s going to be smart.” Agatha regained her composure. “Want to spend Thanksgiving with us?” She changed the topic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded as Agatha kissed her, taking her mind off Nicky’s earlier questions.
     </span>
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was the week of Thanksgiving and things had been relatively quiet. No texts or deliveries from SF, the public speculation had died down for the moment, and they were on break from school. Alice and Jen had put an offer in on a house they had fallen in love with immediately. The grass was green, the sky was blue, and everyone was gay.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was officially dating Morgan Stark, which Pepper Potts-Stark and Rio were excited about, and Tony Stark and Agatha were not. Billy and Eddie were going strong, and Tommy was more excited about running track next semester.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Alice had always spent the holidays together in San Francisco and were excited to spend them with their chosen family this year. Rio was making pies in her kitchen while Alice ‘helped’ by watching and not touching anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Have the two of you decided what you are yet?” Alice asked as she drank tea.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No. We’re still just dating, but I think I might be ready to take the next step.” Rio slid a pie in the oven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Actually fuck Agatha Fucking Harkness?” Alice raised her eyebrows twice suggestively.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, yes, but no. I’m thinking more like making it official and declare we’re dating,” Rio said as she started on a chocolate pie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s about damn time. Four months, you’ve spent the last one playing tonsil hockey, and she’s taking you to Taylor Swift.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s taking all of us,” Rio interrupted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Whatever, it’s you that counts. She also had Nat get rid of Lou.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nat threatened Lou. Bitch is still alive,” Rio corrected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Unfortunately. She moved you into her house for a few days to keep you safe. Which you LOVED,” Alice reminded her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shut up,” Rio blushed. The truth was, she had loved it. Four nights falling asleep in Agatha’s arms, four mornings waking up in them. When Nicky joked about moving in, she found herself fantasizing about it. It was too soon for that, but she wanted it one day. She wanted the Agatha of it all. She cooked for them each night and helped Nicky with his homework. They had played house for a few days, and she loved it. She shook the memories from her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Whether I loved it or not is beside the point. Maybe one day it will happen. When are you asking Jen to marry you?” She flipped the conversation. At least someone was moving their relationship forward. Wanda had to wait until her divorce, since papers were drawn up but not filed yet, and Rio had just decided to make things official with Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice choked on her drink. “Excuse you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What? You’re buying a house. Are you not going to get married? I’ve already appointed myself as Maid of Honor. I’m trying to decide if I’ll wear a suit or a dress. I assume it won’t be a giant affair. Neither of you is that type,” Rio grinned, putting the next pie in the refrigerator.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shook her head, “You’ve spent too much time with Wanda.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Alice had gone home and the pies were ready to go to Agatha’s, Rio settled in for the night.

<p>
<span>
      Plus her kids.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha read the text multiple times. Rio hadn’t mentioned that before. Why hadn’t she told her that? Agatha had to remind herself that there were still things she was hiding as well.

</p>

      Rio smiled at that. It was a mix of sincerity and wanting to take away the painful memories, the protective side of Agatha, and a tinge of jealousy.

<p>

<p>

      Rio sighed in contentment. She would have a stress-free day, cook with her friends, and at the end of the day, she would tell Agatha Fucking Harkness that she was ready to be her girlfriend. She giggled to herself at the absurdity of it, like she was about to ask someone out for the first time.

      Are you coming to Thanksgiving
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      tomorrow? You’re my family
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      and I miss you.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio groaned and rolled over. Surely this bitch was kidding. Rio decided that if she received any texts on Thanksgiving, she’d let Nat know.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Thanksgiving was perfect. Rio had arrived at Agatha’s at seven that morning, let herself in after she disarmed the alarm, and placed the pies on the counter. She went upstairs to Agatha’s bedroom and found Agatha sound asleep in just panties and an oversized T-shirt. Her hair had returned to its factory settings, and messy curls were fanning out around her. She was curled on her side, both arms under her pillow. Rio toed off her shoes and crawled into the bed next to her, knowing that she could have run and jumped on the bed at full speed, and Agatha wouldn’t have budged. Rio positioned herself under the covers and brushed strands of hair away from the actress's face, scooting closer to her before lightly kissing her forehead, cheek, nose, and then lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled as she slowly opened her eyes, “Good morning, beautiful. Have I ever told you how much I prefer waking up like this?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Only every time it happens.” Rio kissed her fully, morning breath and all. She knew it wasn’t long before the house was full of people, but she had changed her mind about when she wanted to talk to Agatha. Agatha’s lips parted as Rio moaned and slid her tongue alongside Agatha’s slowly. Rio trailed her hand from Agatha’s cheek down her shoulder to her breast, lightly running a thumb over her hardened nipple through the shirt as Rio rolled them so that she was on top, straddling Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha whimpered into Rio’s mouth, this woman was going to be the death of her. Agatha ran her hands up Rio’s back, under her shirt, before scratching down her back, eliciting a gasp from Rio. Rio discontinued her ministrations, breaking the kiss and sitting up, still straddling Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned. “You’re a brat, you know that?” Agatha reached up, lately tracing Rio’s collarbone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave her a toothy smile and nodded. “I have a question.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You can have whatever you want if we could just go back to what we were doing,” Agatha would find a way to single-handedly combat climate change if it meant she could continue kissing Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s face went serious as she put her hand on Agatha’s cheek and scooted back, lightly tugging Agatha so that she was sitting up, eyes locked on each other’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You,” Rio breathed. “Agatha, I want you, officially. As juvenile as it sounds, be my girlfriend? You can even post a statement, right now,” She was looking straight into Agatha’s soul.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      On the inside, Agatha was jumping for joy like a child on Christmas morning. On the outside, she was grinning at her
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       girlfriend.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      “It’s not juvenile, and yes I will be. I want you as well.” She kissed Rio in a way that said
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Always.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She leaned back. “Can I post a picture of us later too?” She updated her socials fairly regularly and wanted to share her happiness with the world. She had promised not to keep Rio a secret, and she meant it. Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s waist and closed the space between their bodies.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Now, I believe you started something,” she fisted a hand in Rio’s hair and captured her mouth in a needy kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio cupped one of Agatha’s lace-clad buttcheeks in one hand and put the other hand on her shoulder. They were fighting for control of the kiss when they heard the door close downstairs and Wanda yell.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Now is when you two decide to do this? Get down here. We have a meal to cook!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They both groaned as they broke the kiss, breathing heavily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m buying a pack of scrunchies,” Agatha said.

      It was Thanksgiving morning, after all, and everyone was waiting downstairs. Once Agatha was presentable and everyone had busied themselves with meal preparations, Agatha took a picture of her and Rio and made a Jen-approved post on her socials.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Happy Thanksgiving from us to you. Thankful for my girlfriend, son, and amazing family and friends!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She threw in a few hashtags and let it go. Rio made a mental note to check the comments later when her phone dinged.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was also a picture attached, except it wasn’t the one Agatha had just posted. It was worse. It was of Agatha and Rio in Agatha’s bed, with Rio straddling Agatha and kissing her. It looked like the picture had been taken through the window. Rio was shaking. The phone dinged again. Another picture. This one of her staring at the phone. She looked up, trying to figure out the angle as she stormed out the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha noticed when Rio received the text and alerted Nat. When Rio went outside, everyone followed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes were wide with panic and fear. She was rubbing the left side of her chest as she felt the familiar symptoms of a panic attack seep in. She whipped her head around to search for Lou, looking into the trees, bushes, everywhere. Then, she heard whirring of some kind and saw a flash of red hair leap into the air and take down a low-flying drone, landing in some superhero pose.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They heard a woman’s laugh, the slam of a car door, and a car speeding off. Nat looked at the drone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There must have been two. This one is a red herring, but I’ll take it to Darcy,” She was pissed, “I’m taking another trip.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shook her head, “You’re not leaving until tomorrow. Please,” she pled. “We’re getting to be ourselves this year.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was ready to commit murder herself as she wrapped her arms around a frozen and sobbing Rio. “It’s okay, we’ll increase security, it’s okay.” She soothed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned towards the group. “Everyone back inside, blinds and shades closed. We’re not letting her ruin this, okay?” She corralled everyone inside as Nat made calls and increased security around the compound.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      All eyes turned to Rio’s phone when it dinged again.

</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s a psychopath,” Jen exclaimed after she read the text.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at the girlfriend whose hand she still held, “Was that the laugh we heard?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head, “No. Someone else, a P.I. or someone she hired, most likely. I don’t trust it, though.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mom, what happened?” Nicky asked from the table. The three boys had picked up that something was happening but didn’t know what exactly, as they had been instructed to stay inside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio buried her face in her hands as she turned into Agatha and sobbed. Her world had crashed in as she realized that the boys were potentially in danger now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha held Rio tightly as if she was the only thing holding her together. The four parents exchanged looks, trying to decide how best to handle the conversation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was Alice who spoke instead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know you boys have some experience with this from your mom’s fame, but Rio has a stalker. A relentless one. It’s one of the reasons she moved here. We call her SF for San Francisco. If you say her name three times, she’ll appear like Beetlejuice.” Billy smiled at that one. He was playing Beetlejuice in the school play in just a few days.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Was she hurt?” Tommy asked. He vaguely remembered someone sending his mom random notes a few years ago, but nothing came from it. He had heard horror stories at school, though.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was still seeking solace in Agatha and thankful that Tommy had gathered that now was not the time to ask Rio any direct questions. These boys were wise beyond their years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice nodded. “She was. It’s why I brought her here. I knew she would be safe in our little coven.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky thought everything over carefully. He knew Alice hadn’t done it intentionally. She hadn’t known his mom would be taken by Rio, but he would have to thank her one day. Things were a little scary right now, but Rio had been good for every single person on the compound, especially his mom. Agatha had never been unhappy, necessarily, but he had never seen her this happy either. He and the twins had also deduced that Rio had been the one to make the final push for Aunt Wanda to make her decision as well, AND Jen and Alice were together. There was something about Rio that was magic. He also knew his mom and Mr. Stark weren’t on the best terms, so if Rio could smooth things over in that department, this could work for him, too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He came out of his thoughts as Billy shook him, “Hey, space cadet. We’re going to help Jen monitor the internet for anything shady being posted.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky nodded. “Sounds like a plan.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The excitement of the morning had died down, and cooking had resumed. There was still tension, but Nat had worked quickly to call in a few favors and increased security, pulled camera footage, and even called Darcy to see if she could trace the number that had texted Rio that morning. Unfortunately, SF was good and it led to a useless burner phone. That’s when Nat decided to create a clone of Rio’s phone on her computer and reverse-stalk Lou. The phone Lou was using was off, so she couldn’t see her current location. However, a few older texts came up. The texts from this morning were not the first Rio had received. That girl had been hiding this. Nat swore under her breath. Agatha had found someone who also dealt in half-truths. Nat walked into the kitchen, where the other women were cleaning up. “Rio, can I borrow you for a minute? Nothing major.” She knew Rio was on high alert and didn’t want to cause her anxiety to go any higher.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sure,” Rio put a plate in the dishwasher, kissed Agatha on the cheek, and followed Nat. Wanda and Agatha exchanged looks as the other two women walked out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once they were out of earshot, Nat turned and held up Rio’s phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I cloned your phone so I could keep track of SF,” Nat said quietly as she handed it back to the wide-eyed woman. Rio hadn’t even known Nat took it in the first place. “Before you even say anything, why didn’t you say anything earlier, before the flowers?” Nat seemed more concerned than mad.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I thought I could handle it, or that she would just give up,” Rio said meekly, "I know she’s not the most stable, but I didn’t think she would fly off the handle like this.” Rio’s voice went even quieter, and Natasha had to lean in so she could hear her. “I still don’t think she’d actually hurt me in any way. It was Shane who did that, hurt me, not her. Never Lou.” When she finished speaking, her voice was barely audible, and a fresh tear slid down her cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fuck,” Natasha stood. “You still love her.” It was a statement, not a question.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged. “I really don’t know. I am still processing it. It was a large part of my life that just fell apart so quickly.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Natasha nodded. She knew a thing or two about things happening quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Talk to Agatha. If you don’t tell her, I will. I’m not going to watch her get hurt…” Nat had to stop herself from adding ‘again’. She knew Agatha hadn’t told Rio about that, but she was ready to threaten Agatha, too. “...and this would crush her if you don’t tell her now. Anyone in the state of California with eyes can see you two…care…about each other. Communicate. Please.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, gathering her composure. “I will. Tonight.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Everyone had left, and Rio thought about what Nat had said. She needed to come clean, and she knew that she couldn’t completely be with Agatha in any physical way until she told her about her emotional conflicts. Rio wordlessly took Agatha’s hand and led her to the couch, guiding her to sit so they could face each other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had noticed that Rio had been rather quiet since speaking with Nat in the hallway an hour ago, and Agatha had been worried. She put down her wine, taking Rio’s hands in hers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What is it, Rio? What’s wrong?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a shaky breath. “I’ve been lying to you, and I need to confess a few things.” The words tumbled out of her mouth, and they were not the ones she had rehearsed in her brain for the past forty-five minutes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha started replaying every conversation since they first met. “Okay…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked down at the couch. “Today was not the first time SF texted me. It was actually a few weeks ago…” She told her about the warning to stay away from Agatha, the text about the stars, and the one from the night prior. “Nat knows now and can now see everything that comes into my phone.” She could tell that Agatha was considering Rio’s words. She wasn’t mad but hurt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why didn’t you tell me?” Agatha ached at this, but at the same time, wasn’t she still harboring a giant secret? One that ate at her more and more by the day?  Although,  this could have caused harm to all of them, and still could. She pushed her hurt aside, knowing it was a small penance for keeping her secrets tight to her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio curled into herself, wrapping her arms around her knees, trying to make herself as small as she felt. She hated having to admit these feelings to Agatha. She didn’t want to have them for anyone but Agatha. “I didn’t think she would do anything, Agatha. L…SF had never hurt me, physically. Had never hurt anyone I was close to. I didn’t think she had completely lost it, didn’t want to believe it. It was her ex-husband that hurt me. And then, Alice was with me, there was the order, no contact….”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Another tear escaped the war behind her eyes as her voice died out. She couldn’t bring herself to look at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt like a fist had closed around her heart. She knew what Rio was saying without her actually saying it, and Agatha was trying her best not to crumble. “Rio,” Agatha’s voice shook, “how do you feel about her?” Agatha had to know if Rio was still in love with her. She had just finally gotten Rio, that fucking morning. Now, here they were with Rio about to tell her she may still be in love with another woman.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio winced. Agatha’s voice was too shaky, yet too strong at the same time. “You have to understand everything that happened,” Rio started, “I found out on Christmas Day that things were absolutely not over between her and the hubby, and they most likely never would be. I stormed out of the house and out of her life. We had been talking about our future that morning. A secret marriage, leaving the country, her retiring, very Evelyn Hugo, when she got a phone call from him, and you would think I hadn’t even existed. Like we hadn’t spent the entire morning making love and talking about our plans, so I made up my mind and left. Alice came to town that day and found me sobbing.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha realized that their pasts weren’t that dissimilar, this would be the perfect time to divulge her own past, but this moment wasn’t about her. She waited patiently until Rio inhaled deeply, ready to go on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “When she realized I was serious, the texts, gifts, pictures, the whole stalking thing started. When she broke into my house in February, I had to get a temporary order, and you know the rest. I never got closure, Agatha. We were never able to discuss everything. One minute, we were talking marriage and…well, it doesn’t matter, but then we were over. She was the first woman I thought I could spend the rest of my life with, and then it was over.” Rio had stopped crying, and she found that she was angry more than anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hadn’t answered her question, and Agatha still needed the answer. She untangled Rio’s hands from her knees, tipped her chin, and locked eyes. She had to be able to see Rio’s eyes when she finally got her answer. “Rio, now that I understand everything. How do you feel?” She asked again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       in
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      love with her. I don’t want to
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       be
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      with her. I meant it when I said I want to be with you, Agatha. I care about
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       you
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      deeply. I
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       choose
      </span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
       you,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was the truth. Did part of her love Lou? Yes, but it was more of a mourning of a sudden loss than anything. She was Agatha’s, and all the crazy in the world wasn’t going to change that. She grabbed Agatha by the collar of her shirt and brought her in for a searing kiss, a proclamation, and a promise, the taste of salt from tears mixed in with hot breath, moans, and teeth. Agatha shifted and kissed away Rio’s tears before leaning back slightly. “Rio?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hmm?” She answered, her lips swollen, trying to chase Agatha’s mouth to continue what they were doing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, Rio, be serious.” She said in a slightly more commanding tone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned back and tried to focus.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please stop keeping things from me,” The hypocrisy was not lost on Agatha, but this wasn’t about her. “You can tell me anything. If we’re going to do this, we have to be honest and communicate with each other,” she realized she wasn’t applying this same logic to herself. However, she hadn’t survived this long in the industry by being honest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, “Yes. Thank you for being patient with me. I know this is a lot.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed her again, “I will always choose you, too.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat back, wiping at her eyes. “One minute! If you’re going to do this, so am I.” She pulled up her socials, as some people had already found her throughout the day since she had ‘liked’ Agatha’s posts. “Come here,” she turned so she was in front of Agatha and took a selfie of them, Rio’s back pressed against the front of Agatha, Rio kissing Agatha’s cheek, Agatha looking down at her and smiling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Perfect!” She posted it with the caption. ‘So thankful for the woman I call my girlfriend! Happy Thanksgiving!’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grinned. “I really like the sound of that, by the way,” as she kissed Rio again, slowly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was then that Natasha barrelled through the door. “Alice’s, NOW.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou sat in Alice Wu-Gulliver’s darkened apartment. The restraining order only covered Rio’s physical location and apartment, not Alice’s. Surely, Lou could speak to Alice and tell her how she felt about Rio. If anyone could talk sense into her beautiful Rio, it was Alice. Lou couldn’t believe the pictures the investigator had sent her that morning, and she hadn’t been able to get to LA quickly enough. Agatha Harkness was obviously bad for Rio. She was a known fuck boi, Lou knew that personally. So what if Agatha was slowing down in her old age? She was using Rio. Probably for better grades for her son or something. Rio was better and out of Agatha’s league. Rio belonged to Lou and only Lou. She had thought about cat-napping that incessant beast of Rio’s, but that was the one thing she would never forgive. Crow? Finch? Whatever bird the damn thing was named after meant the world to Rio. Lou hated cats, and the foul thing hated Lou.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maybe, if this didn’t work out, she could make it look like Agatha poisoned the damned thing. Rio would surely come back to Lou in that scenario. That was a thought. Rio would never love Agatha, then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou snapped out of her thoughts when she heard a key turn. It was about damn time. Why did everyone spend so much time at that damn compound anyway?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I just don’t see why you can’t tell me who the psychotic bitch is, honey,” Jen said to Alice as they walked in the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because it’s,” she flipped on the lights, and her eyes automatically landed on the blonde model sitting on her couch. “Lou,” she finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “See,” Jen laughed, “That wasn’t so hard,” it was then that Jen’s eyes also landed on the woman, her mouth forming an ‘o’. “Lou Falco? Oh shit. Rio does have a type.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s about time, Alice,” Lou said, not bothering to get up. She turned her head to Jen, “You must be the infamous Jennifer Kale, charmed, I’m sure,” she looked back to Alice. “I’m here about Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You heartless bitch. Leave her alone. She was healing. She was finally moving on from you.” Alice was furious as she stalked towards where Lou was on the couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou sighed, “Oh Alice, don’t you see I’m here because I love her? I need you to see that so you can tell her so and talk sense into her. Agatha doesn’t love her. Not like I do. Agatha will just fuck and forget her like she does every other woman.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You hid her, Lou. Lied to her. Your husband almost killed her. If he had still been in his prime, he would have. You USED her, Lou. Not Agatha.” Alice may have been smaller, but she was ready to kill to protect one of her coven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had quietly taken a picture and sent it to Nat, and was now discreetly recording the entire thing. She made sure her phone was on silent so if Nat texted back, Lou wouldn’t be alerted. Jen wouldn’t be surprised if this lunatic were armed. She stepped forward and put an arm around Alice’s waist.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know who you are, and I can destroy your entire career.” Jen spat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou rolled her eyes. “Please, I’d give it all up for Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice cackled, “Right. If you were willing to do that, you’d have done it already. You’ll do what you always do: promise her the world, make her come back, and then crush her heart. You do it every fucking time. If you did love her, you’d let her go. You’d let her be happy. AGATHA makes her happy. She was NEVER that happy with you. She’s always smiling now, Lou. She doesn’t call me in tears anymore. She doesn’t call me because she saw Agatha on someone else’s arm. Do you know why? Because she’s the one on Agatha’s arm. Agatha Fucking Harkness, who infamously NEVER takes anyone to anything, has and will take Rio to EVERYTHING, Lou. You were afraid to be seen in public with her. Even as a fucking friend unless it was as a group. Even that only happened a handful of times in TWO YEARS. They’ve been friends for FOUR months.” Alice was breathing like she’d been in a boxing match.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou’s phone went off and when she checked it, her face went pale. Though Rio had blocked her on all of her socials, Lou followed her anyway on burner accounts. The notification was a post from Rio. A declaration and commitment to Agatha. After the lengths Lou had gone through for her today, Rio was making the relationship public now and even posted a picture.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice raised an eyebrow and checked her phone since she received a similar notification. She smiled and handed her phone to Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Looks like she chose Agatha over you,” Jen smirked, “Do you get it now? She doesn’t love you, Falco,” Jen was choosing her words carefully, the phone still inconspicuously filming.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s clearly been brainwashed,” she scoffed but turned eager once more. “This isn’t over. I was hoping you could help me, Alice. You were always the one to help my sweet Rio make decisions when she was confused about her emotions.” Lou stood and started towards the door, pulling a hood over her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, I usually told her to leave you.” Alice moved out of the way before Lou could even brush against her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I assume Agatha has at least one goon on the way.” She eyed Jen. “I’ll be taking my leave.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen knew Lou’s reputation and made sure to have a grip on her phone as Lou made to leave when Alice had an idea. It was a bad one, but it was an idea.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio’s coming with them.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou stopped, “She is?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen nodded in agreement. “Yes, now’s your chance.” Natasha had texted back that all four of them were on the way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou looked around. She was cornered here, it wasn’t a good idea. She could make her escape if she met them outside though. She kept walking and easily slipped by both women and out the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at Alice, “Do we go after her?” She asked her girlfriend. Alice just nodded. She already had her hand on the doorknob.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice saw the door to the stairs close and nodded to the elevator. “She’s going to meet them outside. She’s done this before. Let Nat know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The four women had just exited the vehicle in the parking garage as Nat read the text from Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s on her way out here,” She turned to Agatha and Rio. “Aggie, you should get her out of here.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. “It’s fine,” She gripped Agatha’s hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was ready to tear this SF bitch limb from limb herself. She knew the threat to her family and her happiness this woman posed and she was ready to do what she needed to do.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You are to stay back,” Nat said, putting both hands on Wanda’s shoulders. Wanda opened her mouth to protest as Nat kissed her, just in case something went wrong.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nu. Te iubesc,” Nat added in Romani, Wanda’s first language.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       No, I love you.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “YA tozhe tebya lyublyu,” Wanda said in Russian.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I love you too.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They turned their heads as they heard Jen and Alice’s footsteps hurry towards them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s not here yet?” Alice looked around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I recorded everything,” Jen told Nat as she turned to Rio. “You need to hear it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. Everyone stilled when they heard running. Jen turned her phone on to record as Nat motioned for Wanda, Alice, and Jen to get back in between the vehicles.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat, Agatha, and Rio stepped out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou came into view, slowing her steps, taking in the three women. Agatha and the pretty goon weren’t her concern. It was her beautiful Rio that she had her eyes on. She knew she only had a few minutes. She had told her own personal bodyguard to drive through here like a bat out of hell in five minutes, shooting if need be. Agatha, that cad, had her arms around Rio. Didn’t that movie star whore know that Rio belonged to Lou?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, love, I came for you.” Lou smiled as she approached.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tightened her grip on Rio as she got a look at the woman coming close to her. She knew it was Lou Falco, but she looked more familiar than that as if she had seen her recently. Maybe in an ad or a commercial or something? “That’s close enough Lou.” She said firmly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This isn’t your business, Harkness.” Lou barked. “This is between my fiancée and I.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyebrows flew up as she loosened her arms and looked at Rio. Nat didn’t flinch. She knew this was a tactic when she heard Alice hiss at Wanda and Jen that Lou was lying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You never proposed. You just made promises you never planned on keeping,” Rio said, voice steady. She laced Agatha’s fingers through her own. “Stop pursuing me, Lou.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou grinned threateningly, “But I love you, and you’re mine.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s her own person!” Agatha shouted. She hated when people thought they owned others. Yes, you could ‘belong’ to someone if you chose to do so, but you were still your own person first.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou was closing in fast and reached towards Rio, who stepped into Agatha at the same time Agatha pulled Rio into her and in between their SUV and another car, knowing Nat was going to take over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Takeover Nat did. She slammed Lou to the ground with the full force of her body as she slammed a fist into her left cheek. She was just getting started when she heard tires screeching. Nat dove away from Lou and heard the slam of car doors and tires screech away. She waited a moment before jumping up and running to Wanda first, helping her up as she ran her hands over her and covered her in kisses. “Are you okay?” Nat asked as she checked for even the smallest scratch while Wanda laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Baby, all I did was watch.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t care, I was worried.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’re fine too, by the way,” Jen said, pulling Alice up and waving her phone slightly. “Everything was recorded.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had gently helped Rio to her feet, lightly caressing her face, arms, and shoulders. If she could have caressed her heart and mind, she would have. “I don’t think it’s over,” Rio whispered as she hugged Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, sweetheart, I know.” Agatha held her while looking at the other women. She was ready for the fight of her life.
     </span>

<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Someone had poked the bear inside of Agatha, and she was ready to maim.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat had left the next morning and gone to Connecticut, straight to Shane Falco, Lou’s ex-husband. He walked into his office at ESPN to find Nat with an envelope and an offer. He could choose to have full custody of his children and file charges against his wife for child endangerment, forcing a psychological evaluation and hospitalization, or Nat could expose the bribery from Falco over what had happened last spring with Rio. She filled him in on the last twenty-four hours and the actual story of his ex-wife’s actions. Nat was not one to use someone’s mental health against them, but this was a different story.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The way Lou spun the ‘situation’, as Shane called it, with Rio was much different than what had really happened. Lou had lied about the entire relationship to Shane. He had finally divorced Lou after seeing holes in her story. He feared for their three kids and was generally concerned about Rio’s safety, as well as apologetic about what he had done.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He wasn’t a bad guy, Nat thought, but another victim of Lou’s manipulation. By Monday, he had the kids, and Lou was admitted against her will. That was taken care of, at least temporarily. Rio hadn’t wanted her name involved or any connection to Agatha, so it was only a matter of time before Lou’s return.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>

      Agatha still had increased security, warned the school, and had bodyguards assigned to everyone. She didn’t care where Lou was. If she wasn’t six feet in the ground or scattered across the earth, she didn’t trust it.

      The comments about Agatha and Rio being an official couple had been mostly positive. Jen had given an official statement to a few of her magazines of choice over the next few days about how Agatha and Rio were just taking it slowly and seeing where things led. With Rio posting from her personal socials, her last name had leaked, and they now had two hashtags, and the internet had gone wild.
     </span>

<span>
      “#ViDarkness is much more creative than #Agathario.”
     </span>

      “Agatha and Rio taking things slowly, says a source close to the couple.”
     </span>

<span>
      “Everytime ‘People’ says a ‘source’ you know it’s Jennifer Kale”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Jennifer Kale has such perfect skin.”
     </span>
</p>

      “I heard a rumor that Jennifer Kale is dating Lorna Wu’s daughter, Alice.”
     </span>

      “Can you imagine Thanksgiving at Agatha’s?”

      “I wonder what Nicky calls Rio?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha and Rio could cure my mommy issues AND my teacher issues.”
     </span>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was glad the attention was off of Wanda, for now, but didn’t like the spotlight and pressure being on Rio. She didn’t mind sharing the spotlight. She just didn’t want Rio to have any added stress. Rio just shrugged it off. As long as she didn’t have a crazy stalker, she was fine. Agatha knew they would receive a lot of attention in Vancouver, being in the VIP tent. She would have to talk to Jen about media training for Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      First up, however, was Billy’s musical at SHIELD. He had been preparing for it all semester, and theater was understandably a big deal at SHIELD. Productions were always a major event and close to Broadway caliber. Billy looked great in his Beetlejuice costume, and the other two boys had quick cameos as dead football players. The adults took their seats, and while Rio knew that Lou couldn’t hurt her at the moment, she didn’t completely trust it and kept glancing around. The middle and high schoolers were amazing, and Billy had performed his heart out, proving that he was very much a Maximoff.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was finally Saturday morning and time for Vancouver and the Taylor Swift concert on Sunday. Rio was filled with excitement as she and Agatha got to their hotel suite.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re sure you’re okay with your son having a room with two other teenage boys?” Rio raised an eyebrow as she looked at her girlfriend. “There is a spare room in here he could have.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No one is sharing a room with us.” Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio as she brought her in for a kiss. “I plan to do a lot of this.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “I approve of this plan.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyes flew open as she remembered something. She walked briskly to her suitcase and fished out a new pack of scrunchies. “Look! No one will bother us!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a cackle. “Brilliant. We can put them on the doorknob just so everyone leaves us alone,” Rio teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That would allow us to sleep in,” Agatha wrapped her arms back around Rio’s waist.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Watch the movies we want to watch.” Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha’s shoulders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Get dressed in peace.” Agatha kissed Rio gently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was a knock on the door, followed by Nicky’s voice, “Mom! Dad! We’re hungry!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha dropped her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He has his own fucking credit card. I’m going to murder him.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stomped to the door like a petulant teen.

      They had all gathered in the main room of Agatha and Rio’s suite for movie night to watch the Christmas classic, Die Hard. The boys and Vision sprawled on the floor, Nat and Wanda on one end of the couch, Jen and Alice on a loveseat, and Agatha and Rio on the other end of the couch. Agatha and Rio were the last two awake as Hans Gruber fell to his death.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This and The Muppet’s Christmas Carol are the best Christmas movies,” Agatha stated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Bad Mom’s Christmas. I love you in that movie,” Rio added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You would,” Agatha smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What? Like you said, I have a type.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, famous older women with a penchant for breaking the law,” Agatha said as she kissed her cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “At least I’m consistent!” Rio got up and headed to their bedroom. ‘Their bedroom’. Even if it was just for two nights at a hotel, she could get used to that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha followed her. “I’m consistent! Attractive, breathing, with a pulse. That’s consistent.” She teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio settled in the middle of the bed, “You sure do know how to make a gal feel special.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha settled beside Rio, tipping her face up so their eyes met.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, did I ever date before?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head in reply.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “YOU are my type. Intelligent, sassy, kind, caring, beautiful, honest…” Agatha punctuated each adjective with a kiss as Rio smiled. Agatha was being honest, even if she was still holding back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tightened her hold on Agatha as she kissed her back, hands tangled in Agatha’s hair. Rio knew she had fallen for Agatha but refused to admit it. She was Agatha’s, and if everyone hadn’t been asleep one room over like a sleepover, she would show her as much. Instead, she sighed frustratedly as she assumed her now familiar sleep position.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We have got to set firmer boundaries in this family,” Rio murmured mostly to herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agreed,” Agatha whispered into her hair as she trailed her fingers up and down Rio’s back before they fell asleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was Taylor Swift Day, and Rio was floating. She had seen the Eras tour in 2023, but this was different. This was the VERY LAST SHOW and she was with AGATHA FUCKING HARKNESS. Her friends, too, but mainly Agatha. Her girlfriend. Rio still pinched herself on occasion to make sure this was her reality. They were all covered in glitter and dressed in various costumes and outfits. Nicky was dressed as a lime green dog, Tommy as a black one, and Billy wore a shirt that said ‘Wide-Eyed Gays’.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There were several VIP tents, and they exchanged friendship bracelets with different people and sang along with Gracie Abrams, waiting for Taylor to come on, and screaming when she did, in all of her tangerine body suit glory.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I need those boots!” Agatha yelled into Rio’s ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Any and every one of those bodysuits would look amazing on you,” Rio yelled back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They all sang, yelled, screamed, and danced along for three and a half hours. There were tears and sobbing to Taylor’s speeches as well. They had all screamed the line ‘shade never made anybody less gay’ during “You Need To Calm Down” and Wanda had taken a lot of pictures of everyone. Agatha had told Rio that Wanda and Nat tended to get carried away at concerts and to cover them if it looked like they might. She felt justified when they watched Nat look deeply into Wanda’s eyes singing the line ‘marry me Juliet’, but grateful that Vision and the boys formed a wall around them. Rio and Agatha both sang “We Are Never Getting Back Together” at the top of their lungs. When Rio asked Agatha why she was feeling the song so hard, she said she just liked it a lot, with a shrug. Agatha knew it was because that one relationship she had been in had been on and off again for so long, though Agatha wasn’t going to tell Rio here. It was also why ‘All Too Well’ hit so hard, especially the age gap it referenced. Agatha had been the younger woman and it had hurt a lot, being in such different places in their lives.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was during Enchanted, though when Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio, and they sang to each other without even realizing it. Agatha noticed how true the lyrics rang for her. She remembered when she asked Lilia if Rio was single immediately the day they met at the fieldhouse. And how she hadn’t wanted the night to end the first time Rio had come back to her house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took more pictures with Nat’s arm around her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sang “Look What You Made Me Do” with a vengeance and then every Folkmore song with her whole chest. Agatha loved how passionate Rio was about music, and how much she got into it. She could tell how elated Rio was as she leaned in to steal a kiss during “Betty”.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When “Illicit Affairs” and “My Tears Ricochet” came on, Agatha sang with emotion from deep within. The line “Don’t call me kid, don’t call me baby” reminded Agatha of how those terms would ring in her ear with a mocking tone, hurting her more and more. Now, every time Rio called Agatha ‘baby,’ it erased a memory of that, mending the scars with love and care. She was carried on those emotional waves through “My Tears Ricochet”, each lyric feeling like she was tossing another shovel full of dirt on the past and screaming for freedom at the sky.  At a couple of points, she caught Rio glancing at her with curiosity. She hoped Rio wouldn’t ask her about them later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The mood shifted when “Marjorie” started. Agatha knew that Rio and Alice were thinking about Gran, as she saw them sing and sob together. Then, “Willow” brought out the witch in all of them, and they danced through the 1989 era like they were trying to cast a spell.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The music kept them bouncing and singing. At one point, Rio turned and gestured to Agatha as she sang, ‘I can make the bad boys good for the weekend,’ and Agatha laughed with pure happiness. Lastly, they all screamed along to Bad Blood, remembering the events of Thanksgiving and how Lou nearly ruined their day.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio squealed with delight at the appearance of the The Tortured Poet’s Department set. The last Eras Tour show Rio had attended didn’t have it.  Despite being sweaty and exhausted, the euphoria and adrenaline fueled her partying. Billy was also having the time of his life. When his current favorite ‘But Daddy I Love Him’ started, he FaceTimed Eddie so they could sing together. The young love made Agatha smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?’ was another group favorite. Agatha felt as if she had grown up in an asylum, it had definitely felt like a circus. She still had a bite left in her bark, though.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It amused Agatha when she and Rio both changed the pronouns of “The Smallest (wo)Man Who Ever Lived”.. Agatha felt her eyebrows rise when Rio screamed it. She must have been channeling all of her feelings about a certain blonde and it was healing for her. If she had been honest with herself, Agatha would have admitted it was cathartic for her as well. The song drew on memories of both her mother and her ex. Her mother, who had literally sent someone to kill her. And her ex, who had destroyed her and truly ruined a few sparkling summers. Despite the memories and suppressed heartbreak that tried to bubble up, Agatha made sure her facial expressions didn’t give anything away. She didn’t think Rio had noticed anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But then, Taylor started “I Can Do It With A Broken Heart.” This song reverberated in the depths of her soul, reflecting the most intimate and painful moments from her youth. Not that Rio knew any of that story.  The story of when someone had told Agatha they would love her for their whole life, and then they very much did not. She wondered if Rio related to the song as much as she did. Or Wanda, for that matter, who returned to her sight at that moment. Wanda had taken Nat’s hand as she and Agatha both yelled, ‘TRY TO COME FOR MY JOB’ at the same time, causing them to giggle afterward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When it was time for the acoustic songs, Taylor had changed into the pink and orange dress they were all hoping she would wear as she spoke about it being the last show before playing A Place In This World mashed with New Romantics. They all cried at the Long Live/New Year’s Day/The Manuscript mashup, especially when she added the ‘end of an era’ lyric. ‘I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you’ had a special meaning to all of them, and Agatha leaned into Rio and whispered, ‘I want your midnights’ in her ear. When Rio looked into Agatha’s eyes and said, “Never become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere,” Agatha felt the weight of the implied permanence. Permanence she could handle. It was the depth of feeling she didn’t want to admit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Still, Agatha shook her head and replied, “Never,” before kissing Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky made a gagging sound behind them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Taylor dove into the stage and swam off, going into ‘Lavender Haze’. During ‘Vigilante Shit’ the coven exchanged looks and tried not to laugh. ‘Mastermind’ was an Agatha Harkness anthem, if there ever was one, “if you fail to plan, you plan to fail”. Agatha had a carefully constructed plan for nearly everything. She had a Jen, a Natasha, and teams of people. It was something she had learned long ago. She noticed that Rio was analyzing her as they sang. During the final song, ‘Karma’, the boys, Vision, Nat, and Rio, all yelled, ‘girl on the screen coming home to me’. Vision laughed as he and the boys covered Wanda and Nat so they could kiss without being photographed like they were all those years ago. Jen and Alice just enjoyed the fact that they could do what they wanted, and no one paid attention to them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After the show, Agatha led them all backstage, where they met Taylor, who hugged them all! Rio’s brain buzzed as she looked at the energetic musician, it was completely unfair that someone the same age as her had just done all of that and still looked unphased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You must be Rio! It’s great to meet you!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Taylor Swift knew who she was!
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      If she didn’t have plans for the rest of the night, Rio could die happy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s me. Great to meet you as well. You were amazing,” She was used to big stars by now, but to her, this was different.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They chatted for a moment and Rio learned that Agatha and Wanda were friends with Taylor. Alice had been holding out on that information, but that explained the fantastic tickets they had last year and for the Reputation tour when she thought about it. They took pictures on all of their phones and Taylor made Agatha and Wanda both promise to post them on their socials and she would post on hers as well for her wrap-up. Taylor had even exchanged numbers with Rio, asked the boys about school and dating, and was thrilled to hear about the updates with Jen and Alice, as well as Wanda and Nat. Of course, Taylor Fucking Swift knew what was going on with Wanda and Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Definitely one of the best days of her life, she thought.

     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had all dozed on their way back to the hotel and departed to their separate rooms upon arrival. Rio was wide awake when they got to the suite, entering after Agatha and closing the door behind her. She had worn high-waisted jeans, a sheer long-sleeved white shirt with a black bra underneath, and now had a Taylor Swift T-shirt on over that. Agatha was wearing a black strapless jumpsuit that Rio had wanted to unzip all night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Their shoes and bags hit the floor as they walked through the suite and into the bedroom. Rio shut that door behind them as well, placing a scrunchie on both handles, unbeknownst to Agatha. She took Agatha’s hand and pulled Agatha into her. “Thank you for tonight.” she breathed, sliding both hands around her waist and resting them on Agatha’s firm butt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha put a hand in Rio’s hair, gripping it lightly, fingernails barely scratching Rio’s scalp. She placed the other hand on Rio’s hip, nails slightly pressing through the fabric.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank YOU for going with me, my beautiful girlfriend.” She pulled Rio toward her, sliding their lips together as Rio’s instantly parted for Agatha. Agatha moved her tongue against Rio’s hungrily, Rio felt all of the emotions from the past week crash into her at once as Agatha pulled Rio flush against her, wrapping an arm around her, the hand in her hair guided Rio’s head as Agatha kissed her. Rio returned the kiss just as passionately as her hands began to move, exploring the expanse of Agatha’s back and body. Agatha moved away and trailed kisses along Rio’s jawline and down her neck, finding her pulse point, and swirled her tongue around it, causing Rio to moan.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha,”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes?” Agatha asked as she continued kissing and licking her way down Rio’s neck to her collarbone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Take me to bed,” Rio commanded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew this was typically the point at which she had been putting a stop to things. Tonight, she had other plans. It wasn’t about the concert. It was about being ready. Both her heart and her body told her, she was definitely ready. Agatha broke from Rio’s neck and looked into her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you sure?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “Yes, Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyes were soft, full of warmth and care, something else that Rio was too afraid to name.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Gladly.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed her again as she led Rio to the bed. Agatha took the hem of Rio’s T-shirt and tugged it over her head and dropped it to the ground. She went to do the same with the sheer shirt when Rio stopped Agatha’s hands and shook her head with a sly smile. Rio kissed Agatha again before spinning her around, sweeping Agatha’s long hair over her shoulder, unzipping the jumpsuit, following the zipper with kisses while she went, making quick work of the purple strapless bra, flinging it off to the side.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I thought I was taking YOU to bed,” Agatha said softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shut up Harkness,” Rio licked a long line up Agatha’s spine, as she slid the jumpsuit down and off Agatha. She ran her hands over the smooth planes of Agatha’s back, kissing the nape of her neck. Rio stepped back and gently hooked her thumbs in the sides of Agatha’s purple lacey hipsters and tugged them down, guiding her out of them and turning Agatha around so she could see her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio inhaled deeply when she saw Agatha, all of Agatha in front of her. She looked her over from head to toe and back again. She had seen Agatha on screens and in pictures, but never in person, only for her, like this. Unedited and unfiltered, just for Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, you’re beautiful.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She caressed Agatha’s cheek before kissing her again, softly, longingly, conveying things she couldn’t convey in words. A kiss that said
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I see you.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyes were closed as Rio kissed her. Agatha reached out again to take the hem of Rio’s shirt, only to have her hands slapped away. “Damnit Rio,” she started as she opened her eyes, but her eyes widened as Rio slowly took her shirt off herself, eyes locked with Agatha’s as if saying
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       let me bare my soul to you
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . She reached back to unhook her bra, drawing the straps down her arms, the bra sliding off and joining the growing pile of clothing on the floor.  She stripped away layer by layer, exposing herself to Agatha until nothing remained but Rio in her natural state. Agatha watched her reverently as Rio slowly unbuttoned the three buttons of her jeans before unzipping them. Rio hooked her thumbs in the sides of her jeans and her green boy shorts at the same time as she pulled them down, letting them fall and stepping out of them. As she stood back to her full height Rio was stopped by how Agatha was looking at her. As if she, Rio Vidal, was a goddess of myth standing in front of her and it was Agatha’s sole goal in life to worship Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re perfect, Rio” Agatha breathed, echoing an earlier lost moment. She stepped forward, pressing their bodies together, gasping at the feeling of skin against skin, her hands on Rio’s hips guiding her towards the bed, Agatha’s mouth working against Rio’s in a searing kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The back of Rio’s thighs hit the bed as Agatha lay Rio down and guided her to where she wanted her. Rio’s body was on fire everywhere Agatha was pressed against it, and her need was already apparent. Rio wanted to take her time, revel in this, and spend the night exploring each other. She was also impatient and they had barely touched each other. Rio’s hands were in Agatha’s hair, down her shoulders, tracing the muscles of her back, wherever she could touch. Rio finally had full access to this woman and she didn’t know where to focus first. Rio tried to roll them over, only for Agatha to press Rio’s shoulder back into the bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No,” Agatha growled in Rio’s ear, as she bit the side of Rio’s neck and then sucked. Rio whined in response, flexing her fingers into Agatha’s shoulders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha propped herself to hover above Rio, and ran the back of one hand down Rio’s left side, leaving goosebumps in her wake. She kissed, licked, and nipped down Rio’s neck and chest to her right breast, dragging the flat of her tongue against the hardened nipple, causing Rio to moan. Agatha ran her left hand to the opposite breast, rolling the nipple between her thumb and forefinger, finding a matching rhythm between her hand and mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio moaned, her need growing. She scratched up and down the parts of Agatha’s back she could reach. Rio had always been sensitive, however, this was beyond that. Agatha instinctively knew exactly what Rio needed and wanted, the right amount of pressure, when to use her teeth, and when to pinch or pull. Rio rolled her hips, needing friction and finding none.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha,” Rio breathed, as she fisted a hand in Agatha’s hair and pulled Agatha’s head back from where she was creating a bruise in between Rio’s breasts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up with a wicked smile, “Impatient, beautiful?” she asked Rio as she moved up and kissed Rio before she could reply.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put a hand against Agatha’s cheek as she broke the kiss, giving Agatha a wicked smile of her own and said, “Agatha, if you don’t touch…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The words died on her lips as she saw the same want and need mirrored in Agatha’s eyes that Rio felt in her soul. It wasn’t just about sex, it was about the emotions neither of them planned to admit or confront anytime soon, and just seeing it was enough for Rio. She threaded both hands in Agatha’s hair and kissed her hard, teeth clacking, tongues clashing. Agatha used a knee to nudge Rio’s legs apart as her hand ghosted down Rio’s body, between her breasts, over her stomach, around and down her hip, on the outside of her thigh, and finally up the inside of her thigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had moved a hand to palm at one of Agatha’s full breasts, taking in the sighs and moans she elicited as she manipulated a nipple, appreciating Agatha’s body as Agatha did hers. Rio was writhing underneath Agatha as her hand got closer to where Rio was waiting for her, dripping as Agatha’s fingers lightly brushed over her. Rio whimpered, “Baby, please, I need you,” she pleaded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed down to her ear and whispered, “Anything for you,” as she slid a finger up her slit before drawing tight circles around Rio’s already-hardened clit. Rio let out a long, low moan, moving one hand to scratch up and down Agatha’s back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So wet for me already,” Agatha flicked her tongue along the shell of Rio’s ear as she quickened her movements, to Rio’s delight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio bucked her hips more, feeling her muscles tighten as she dragged her nails up and down Agatha’s back, focusing on the orgasm that was quickly building in her, Agatha’s mouth was back on hers as she swallowed every sound that came from Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio whimpered as she was on the brink, Agatha was putting just the right amount of pressure on her clit when Agatha’s thumb quickly replaced her fingers on Rio’s clit, and two fingers sank deep inside of her. Rio cried out at the sudden sensation and dug nails into Agatha’s back as her muscles clenched around Agatha’s fingers. Agatha thrust hard and fast, curling her fingers forward each time to hit Rio’s front wall. Rio clung to Agatha as she screamed out Agatha’s name and came around her hand. Agatha worked Rio through her climax before withdrawing, kissing Rio slowly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took Agatha’s hand by the wrist, breaking from Agatha’s kiss. She stared into Agatha's eyes as she licked up her palm, tasting the evidence of herself, before taking Agatha’s fingers between her lips and licking them clean, a smile on Agatha’s lips. As she finished her task, Agatha smirked, “Good girl.” She said as she kissed Rio, fresh evidence of where Rio had licked Agatha’s fingers still on Rio’s tongue, and Agatha moaned at the taste.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took the backs of Agatha’s thighs in her hands and began tugging her upwards. Rio loved the sensation of Agatha on top of her and now she needed her to sit someplace else entirely. Agatha looked at her again, an eyebrow raised in question. Rio darted her tongue across her bottom lip as she nodded. “Agatha, I want to taste you.” it was almost a whine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But are you sure you want me to…” Agatha was cut off when Rio crashed their lips together before biting Agatha’s bottom lip just enough that she winced with pleasure. Rio tugged at the back of  Agatha’s thighs again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Up here now, Agatha,” she half commanded, half whined.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha crawled up the bed before she carefully settled a knee on either side of Rio’s head, slowly lowered herself onto Rio, and gripped the headboard.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio reached for Agatha’s waist and pulled her down so that mouth met labia, and Agatha sighed in satisfied relief as the tip of Rio’s tongue drew lines up and down through her slit. Agatha moaned as she matched Rio’s motions and met the pace, taking control. Rio had always considered herself to be dominant but for Agatha? She was putty in her hands, and she liked it. Rio flattened her tongue, increasing the pressure as Agatha increased her pace. She moved a hand to cup Agatha’s ass, digging her nails in, leaving half-moons in her pale skin. The other hand spread the lips at Agatha’s entrance, allowing her to swirl her tongue, teasing around the outside, before dipping it in as far as she could.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gasped at the shallow sensation, bucking against Rio’s nose.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew what Agatha wanted as she moved her tongue back and licked Agatha’s clit in one smooth, long, slow motion as Agatha moaned loudly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, Rio, fuck,” she let out as Rio began to alternate between circling the bundle of nerves and licking it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “As you wish.” She breathed against Agatha’s cunt, causing Agatha to grip the headboard even harder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew Agatha was dripping, the evidence on Rio’s chin. The older woman above her was more than ready when Rio pushed three fingers into her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “RIO, GOD!” She yelled, as she kept one hand on the headboard and gripped the back of Rio’s head with the other, fucking Rio’s face and fingers as hard as she could, moans and curses tumbling from her lips. Rio matched her pace, thrusting hard as she wrapped her lips around Agatha’s clit and sucked. Agatha, came undone around her, her moans and screams quieting as Rio worked her through her climax before carefully removing her fingers and turning her face to kiss Agatha’s thigh, biting it and sucking a bruise there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked down at her, pupils blown, “What are you doing?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio grinned, looking up at her. “Signing my work.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled and shook her head as she moved to lay beside Rio, kissing her and tasting herself on Rio’s lips. “You think you did that good of a job, huh?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smirked, “You were pretty loud, so yes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Guilty,” Agatha ran her hand up Rio’s left side before propping herself up and feeling along her ribcage, finding the slightly puckered skin. She stretched across Rio’s body and kissed the scars there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s heart was in her throat, and it took her a moment to clear it and find her voice. She had just given herself over to Agatha, mind, body, and soul, and now Agatha was halfway on top of her, kissing the stab wounds from the attack.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Aggie, what are you doing?” She whispered, trying to hold herself together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Making a promise never to hurt you,” she said as she rose and looked Rio in the eyes, before softly kissing her. Rio held her as she kissed her back. This was unlike anything she had ever had before, and she knew it. She rolled them over, Agatha allowing her this time, as Rio propped herself up on her side and ran a hand to Agatha’s right hip, where she had noticed a tattoo on the front of her hipbone earlier. She traced her fingers over the heart with the three swords through it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The three of swords. Grief, heartbreak, sorrow,” Rio said, quoting
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The Witches’ Road.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      “I didn’t know you had this, and I’ve uh, seen a lot of things where you’re naked,” She blushed, looking at Agatha. They had just had sex, and she was blushing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled sweetly at her, she was being vulnerable with Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve always had it covered with makeup or edited out,” she explained. “It’s been for me and me only, really. A reminder of what I’ve been through in life.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio traced it with her fingers, “Grief and sorrow I get. Heartbreak?” She raised her eyebrow at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio asking her about heartbreak would have been the perfect time to tell her about that time of her life. Right after having sex, however, was not.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “All of those experiences being the heartbreak. My mother dying the way she did, watching Wanda go through what she has, knowing there was nothing I could do for Lorna, my childhood, everything. There’s a lot of heartbreak in this career.” It was another half-truth she could live with.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I never want to cause you any of those things, just be there for you if you have to face them,” Rio said seriously before kissing her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As tired as they were, they didn’t get much sleep that night.
     </span>
</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hadn’t been asleep for very long when her alarm went off at five that Monday morning following the concert. She and Rio had slept for maybe an hour. Their naked bodies pressed together. Agatha was wrong about wanting to wake up with Rio in her arms every morning. She wanted to wake up naked with Rio every morning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why is your alarm set?” Rio mumbled, mostly asleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Golden Globe nominations are being announced. Movies up first.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled back to throw something on and brush her teeth before going to the main area of their suite.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio followed her and kissed her with fresh peppermint breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha opened the door and entered the main room. Surprised no one was there, she turned back to Rio when she noticed the scrunchie on the handle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, did you put one of those on the other handle too?” Agatha asked, going back into the bedroom to retrieve their phones.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes,” she yawned, going ahead and turning on the TV and finding the broadcast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As expected, Agatha had several texts with a picture of the door, asking if it was safe to come in so they could all watch the announcement broadcast together, an annual tradition. She texted the group chat, telling them it was safe to enter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s about fucking time!” Wanda breezed in immediately after receiving the text, carrying several coffees in hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Pun intended,” Nat added smirking, carrying more coffee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can we just ignore what happened in here last night?” Nicky asked as he carried in donuts he and the other two boys had gone and retrieved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Prepare yourselves to post on socials,” Jen looked at Agatha and Rio, “Shower and look less…like that before posting any pictures, though.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The announcements started, and they ate donuts and drank their coffee as announcements were made.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Death’s Beloved
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Agatha was nominated for Best Lead Actress in a Drama, and was pissed as she turned towards Wanda, “You deserve to be nominated too. We are BOTH the lead in the movie.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shook her head, “I have a better chance in the supporting actress category where I’m not up against you. I’ve never won against you Agatha,” she looked at her best friend in admiration, not jealousy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha crossed her arms. “That WILL change one day, superstar. You’re so much better than me.” Agatha gave her an adoring look. It wasn’t a competition, but if you asked Agatha, Wanda Maximoff was a thousand times the actress and woman Agatha was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As predicted, Wanda was nominated for supporting actress. Their director, screenplay, and score were all nominated. The song “My Beloved” was nominated, “If you win this, Aunt Aggie, you should win the Grammy,” Billy said excitedly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The film was also nominated for cinematic and box office achievement for the records they had broken, especially for being such a hit as a sapphic movie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Neither of them had TV shows they would be up for that year, so they turned the TV off, not interested in sitting through the rest of the list. Jen would bring them up to speed later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked around at everyone. “January 5th for the Globes, so everyone begin working on what you’re wearing and who you’re walking the red carpet with.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once on the plane and headed back to LA, Agatha and Wanda made their celebratory posts about their nominations. Wanda took another group selfie of everyone and posted it along with:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My family, related and chosen, are so grateful that all of you support me in what I do! Death’s Beloved has been one of the most amazing films I’ve ever gotten to work on, and doing it with Agatha was so special! This is such an honor!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had also posted several pictures from the weekend in general. Very cute, very wholesome, very Wanda Maximoff.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha posted pictures from the concert, her and Rio with Taylor, the group with Taylor, just her and Rio, the group on the plane, and her and Rio on the plane.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This has been such a great weekend! Taylor, you were amazing, as always! We love you, and thank you so much for having us and the fam! Thank you to everyone out there for supporting Death’s Beloved the way you have! We led in nominations, and I am so humbled that I get to do the things I do! I love you all!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The internet had already been abuzz since last night it seemed, and Jen had already fired up her laptop, fingers flying. The boys were digging through everything they could find, and Nat was making sure there was nothing they didn’t want out there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha and Rio Get Cozy at Last Eras Stop”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wagatha and Friends Are Swifties!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wagatha’s Boys Are All Grown Up!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The story headlines themselves were fine. There were plenty of pictures of them all, especially shots looking into the tent, though it didn’t seem any pictures had been taken of Nat and Wanda. For that, they were thankful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio’s living a damn fairytale, and her Princess Charming is Agatha Harkness.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Look at them singing to each other!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha is in love with that woman.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, and she’s in love right back.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “THEY’RE IN LESBIANS!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “CHAT, my cousin was there, really close to the VIP tent. She said that Wanda and Nat kept being surrounded by Vision and the boys during ‘romantic’ times, and it looked like they were kissing.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Who’s Nat?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The main bodyguard!! She’s the hot redhead always following them!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh please, Wanda Maximoff is the straightest woman in the world.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha cackled from where she had been reading over Rio’s shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think they both should have been nominated for lead! Homophobes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If we complain enough, we could still influence The Oscars.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The comments and articles went on as Rio put her phone down, leaning into Agatha. They would land soon, and she was exhausted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had been on the phone and turned to Alice crestfallen.  She removed the device from her ear and whispered in Alice’s ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Alice’s face fell, too, Nat spoke up.   “What happened?” She asked her two covenmates.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The deal on the house fell through,” Jen said as she took Alice’s hand. “We’ve been putting deals on houses, but we keep being outbid at ridiculous prices.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The whole mood of the plane had been brought down. Disappointment battled with previous euphoria. Agatha looked at Wanda, shared concern in their eyes. Wanda’s expression suddenly shifted, and Agatha knew immediately where her best friend’s mind had gone. Agatha nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey,” Wanda began. “we have an idea.”

      Jen had been looking at houses for the past year, knowing she wanted a bigger place. Something had told her she would eventually need the added space, and finally, dating Alice solidified it. Asking Alice to move in with her felt natural, but she didn’t think finding something in their flexible price range would be hard. They were being grossly outbid and refused to pay the outrageously inflated prices. Jen was becoming suspicious and didn’t want to play this game. Getting another phone call that their offer had fallen through didn’t exactly surprise her, and she was ready to make a voodoo doll of a very specific blonde model.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had always suspected that Wagatha was damn near telepathic, but watching their silent exchanges was still slightly unnerving. Wanda turned to Jen and Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We have an idea.” She had said, contemplating.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen threw up an eyebrow in question, though she had an idea she already knew.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Build a house on the compound. There’s plenty of room.” Wanda finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Who the fuck are you, and what have you done with Agatha?” Jen turned to Agatha, eyebrow still raised. She loved Agatha, sure, but they tolerated each other the way you tolerated your older sister, whom you cleaned up after.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked. “We wouldn’t live right next door. You could even live further to the back of the property. We’re already clearing land for another house anyway. Either a guest house or if Vision wants to stay within the castle walls.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision’s head snapped up from where he had been helping Tommy with schoolwork, “You’re building a just-in-case house?” That was a complete surprise to him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes.” Agatha, Wanda, and Nat all replied at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Darling, there’s a house near the compound I may be interested in, and it’s close enough for me. I am not a lesbian and do not feel the need to still live within 300 yards of my ex-wife.” Vision turned to look at Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’ll discuss it later?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision nodded as the twins looked at each other. Their parents, biological or otherwise, never argued in front of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked at everyone, “So, one big happy, mostly queer, family compound?” She wasn’t going to add the
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       almost
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , though she had thought it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys had it covered, though, “Just missing two people and a cat.” Nicky mused with a sly grin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes went wide. “Uh, that is…not, we’re not even…” she stammered. These were inside thoughts for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha did her best to keep a blank face, looking at Rio next to her and then back to everyone else.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’re not there yet,” she stated simply.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda scoffed before adding, “Once the divorce is finalized,” she looked over at Vision. “Sorry, dear.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision just shrugged and waved it off. “No need to apologize, Darling.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then, Nat will move in.” Wanda looked over at Nat, smiling brightly. She had waited to live with her again for twenty years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the plane began to descend in LA, the women discussed contractors while the boys continued to check the home network and various devices, employing the background bots and light hacking skills Nat had taught them how to use to monitor for any possible leaks and to delete what they could.
     </span>
</p>

      Nat looked into the very suspicious bidding wars once they had returned home. She wasn’t sure how news was leaking to SF, but it was, and she didn’t like it. Nat didn’t like making people completely disappear, but she was beginning to think this was a safety issue, so she made a note to keep track of who actually bought the properties and who, if anyone, moved in. Nat was also closely monitoring the woman, who hadn’t been released yet, though she knew the model’s lawyers were working on it, and it was just a matter of time. The head of Wagatha, and coven, security had to make a decision, and quickly as Lou was slowly going after more than just Rio. Nat knew what this woman was doing, and it was psychological warfare.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Two could play that game, Nat thought, as she dialed a number to an old acquaintance. “Ya sobirayu eto odolzhenye.” She spoke quickly in Russian.

      The fact that Lilia had let Alice and Rio off for two days that week had shocked Rio. How was it that all it took was a mention of Agatha, and the permission was granted? It was finals week, and the winter formal was on Saturday. There had been a few mutterings about favoritism, but they died quickly after Lilia popped into those specific classrooms. What this meant for the teachers of the coven was that they had to hit the ground running Wednesday morning and administer exams Wednesday and Thursday.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This was why, after having spent Monday and Tuesday with Agatha, Rio needed to go home. It was four in the afternoon, and she had to prepare for the next day. She had been home to check on Raven, but she knew her cat and knew she needed actually to be home.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were lying in Agatha’s bed, facing each other. Rio was twirling strands of Agatha’s hair around her fingers, and Agatha lightly traced her fingers over Rio’s scars.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Aggie, I really need to head home.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I remember you saying that two hours ago,” Agatha smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I did, and then a very beautiful cougar of a woman pushed me against a wall, kissed me, and took me to her bed.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha clicked her tongue. “You’ve got to watch out for those cougars. I hear they’re bad in these Hollywood hills,” Agatha moved forward and kissed Rio. “Stay the night again?” She asked as she moved back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave a small smile. “No, I don’t have everything for tomorrow, and I need to be home for Raven occasionally. Come over tonight? Nicky could stay with Wanda?” Rio countered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew that Nicky could stay by himself or with Wanda, but it was a school night, he had finals tomorrow, and routine was important. If only she could admit her feelings or be an adult about literally any of this. However, she could not. Instead, she found herself giving Rio a sad smile as she saw the disappointment in Rio’s eyes. “I’m sorry, babe, it’s a school night, and I have to keep up the routine while I can. I film the next three days, and then we will film in Canada, starting a few days after the Globes and going for three weeks.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had completely forgotten about Canada. “Will you be in Canada the entire time?” Rio whispered, feeling preemptively sad. She knew she was being ridiculous.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll be home Friday afternoon and leave out on Sunday evening. It’s just for three weeks. Disney reads start in May. Marvel things start shortly after that, and then they’ll revolve around each other. For the TV show, we’ll see if more episodes are ordered, but it premieres in March as a shortened season. I digress. I’ll have more time off in February, but just a few weeks.” Agatha explained, steeling herself. They were starting to get to the difficult part of their relationship, Agatha’s job.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “We have Winter and Spring breaks together, though, right?” she asked hopefully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled, “Of course. Now, before you leave me and I don’t see you until the weekend, come take a shower with me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once Rio had gotten home that evening, she had quite a bit to do to readjust to being home. She still had to unpack, clean out Raven’s feeder, and give the feline much-needed attention, chores, and all the things that had been neglected since Saturday. Alice had come over to oversee everything, and Rio had put her to work folding clothes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you and Jen going to go through with it? Build a house on the compound?” Rio asked from the kitchen as she prepped their lunches for the rest of the week.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We talked about it and decided it’s the best option. Her townhouse isn’t big enough for both of us. Hell, her bathroom is barely big enough for her skin routine.” Alice laughed at her girlfriend’s preferences. “Wanda and Agatha are her only clients, so that makes sense. Then she’ll still have her office for meetings with studio heads or if she needs a quieter space than the compound.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was disappointed that her best friend and sister would be moving out, though it would hopefully be months before it happened. The question she wanted to ask nagged at the back of her mind, and she knew she would find out eventually, so she might as well ask.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did Nat?” She looked at Alice, not even finishing the rest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes. Bitch put in bids and drove prices up, but nothing had been finalized. Nothing else from there.” She kept her expressions neutral and her voice even. She didn’t want Rio to worry.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put the excess food containers in the refrigerator before turning off the light and joining Alice in the living room to take clothes to her bedroom to put away, Alice following her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thanks for your help, Alice.” She started, “As for the problem, how did she know? How is she doing all this?” SF was still in some facility. It had been in news articles and tabloids that she had lost the kids and been ‘sent to work on herself after a mental breakdown due to stress.’ Different rumors were leaking, and the current plan was to ensure no one connected Rio to the supermodel.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shrugged, “That’s what Jen and Nat are trying to find out.” Alice stretched out across Rio’s bed after helping her with all the chores. “Rio?” Her voice had turned serious.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hung up the last piece of clothing and shut the closet door, lying down next to Alice. “Yeah?” The tone of Rio’s voice matched Alice’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you still have all of Gran’s jewelry?” Alice turned her head to face Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was already turned toward Alice, a question on her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, why?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Gran died, Alice and Rio donated or sold almost everything, keeping only that which was sentimental or a family heirloom. Rio, being the more responsible of the two, stalker issue aside, had held on to the jewelry and had it in a safe with important documents.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice was trying to choose words carefully, as she wasn’t completely sure herself. “Just making sure is all,” she replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wait! Do you need the rings? Are you going to propose to Jen?” Rio asked excitedly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice huffed a laugh. “I don’t know. I just wanted to make sure we had them.” She chewed on the inside of her cheek. “I know I want to spend the rest of my life with her, whether that’s marriage or not. I often wonder what would have happened if I hadn’t been an idiot for a decade, where we would be by now. I never wanted kids. I have plenty of those at work, but we could have four dogs by now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised her eyebrows as her forehead crinkled, “Jennifer Kale does not seem like a dog person to me.” She thought for a moment. “Well, maybe one of those little yappy purse dogs.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice gave a small smile, “You’d be surprised, dogs, cats, she likes to hike, not the primadonna everyone thinks she is. We all have layers, Ri.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know that. Everyone’s just full of surprises around here. Anyway, if you need Gran’s rings, I have them. Also, like I said before, let me know if you want me to wear a suit or a dress and if Agatha is the Best Man or not.” Rio grinned at the woman she considered her sister.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good thing I love you, you ass. Speaking of love…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio cut her off with a groan. “Don’t start. I care about her, okay? Can we leave it at that? It’s been four and a half months. It’s too soon.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s not, really. When you know, you know. You’re basing too many things off of she-who-must-not-be-named. Love doesn’t have an incubation period.” Alice had been looking at Rio seriously, trying to get the words to seep through her thick skull.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stared up at her ceiling fan and blew out a breath as she ran her hand through her thick hair, deep in thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What if I’m not ready?” she turned her head back to meet Alice’s eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That is different than saying it’s too soon or denying it. Everyone around you two sees it. Not being ready to go there is one thing, but at least let yourself feel and accept it. Let her in. Let Agatha Fucking Harkness love you and help heal you. YOU’RE not broken, Rio. You never have been. People chose to do terrible things to you, ripped your heart out, and left you to pick up the pieces. You have someone who will gladly help put it back together and make you realize how worthy and deserving of love you are,” Alice put her hand on Rio’s arm. “Let her. She would do anything for you. Let her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes were glassy when Alice finished. “I’m still not ready to admit anything, but I’m ready to be more forthcoming and stop keeping secrets. I can start there, at least.” She covered Alice’s hand with hers. “I’m so glad our preteen angst matched each other.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice let out a small laugh. “You’d be lost without me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Worse.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio lay in bed, Alice’s words looped in her head. She would not admit any feelings to Agatha, but she would be more honest. That was a good first step. She petted the cat that slept and purred on her chest, speaking out loud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Raven, you know I love you, but there’s a woman I’d like in my bed, and it’s not you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The immortal cat opened her eyes and emitted a low growl before returning to sleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio picked up her phone, careful not to disturb the queen.

      Rio had sent the text and didn’t even catch what she had called Nicky before it was too late. She could edit it, but it was already marked as read. It was too late, and sending an “I mean your” text wouldn’t change it. She didn’t realize she was holding her breath as the three dots popped up and disappeared repeatedly until her lungs started to burn from the lack of oxygen, and Raven’s head popped up with alarm. Rio returned to breathing as Agatha finally landed on a reply.

<span>
      “She doesn’t understand how much these parents listen to me.”

      Seeing Rio call Nicky ‘our son’ had made Agatha’s heart leap. Yes, it had happened before, and yes, it was scary, but it also made her feel like maybe she could do this again. She sighed, putting her phone on the nightstand and looking to her left, where Rio had been the previous night. Agatha never imagined she would ever want to consistently share a bed or night with someone again, let alone monogamously. She lay there, staring at the shadows on the ceiling as she was flooded with memories of her ex, her hand unconsciously touching the tattoo of Swords on her hip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Stay the night? Please?” Agatha had asked. She was twenty-three, and after years of Agatha chasing her, Swords had finally given Agatha a chance.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Swords looked her up and down. She was so much older than Agatha and made Agatha painfully aware of it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I don’t stay the night, kid. I also don’t do monogamous. So don’t think I’m going to start now.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha was crushed, but she wasn’t going to cry. Not in front of Swords. She couldn’t look like a baby in front of her. She just nodded.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Right. Don’t stay the night. Don’t give the paparazzi anything to see.” Swords was a mentor, after all.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Precisely, good job.” Swords kissed her in a way that left Agatha feeling more owned than loved.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Another memory, 10 years later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Agatha, I’m too old to have or raise a child, and with your schedule? I would be a primary parent. People would absolutely know we were together then.” Swords scoffed after Agatha brought it up yet again.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You’re right about me. I can’t be a good parent with this life.” Agatha conceded.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You can’t risk being your mother.” Swords reminded her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha winced at the blow. Another point Swords had used to talk Agatha out of having kids.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t cry at these memories anymore. The ache remained, but the sting was gone. She had turned them off to keep going on with her life. Instead, she thought about how exactly Rio would pull off getting Tony to agree to Nicky taking Morgan to the dance. Rio. This woman had come into Agatha’s life and turned it upside down in the best of ways. Yes, she had unknowingly brought a stalker with her, but that they could handle. Agatha’s heart was healing after eighteen years. She was learning to care deeply about someone who wasn’t her family again. If she could just share the trauma of her past, she would be ready to admit her actual feelings. First, she needed Rio to stay over more. She pulled out her phone again and ordered what she needed to make her home Raven-friendly.

      Rio met Tony Stark Wednesday afternoon when he picked Morgan up from basketball practice. He was standing in front of the gym a few minutes before practice was scheduled to let out, and she walked up to him wearing a bright smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, Tony! Morgan did great on her semester final today. I just finished grading it.” Rio said, stopping in front of him. It was true Morgan had crushed the paper portion, and Rio expected she would do just as well on the lab portion the following day.

      “Hey Rio, She’s actually been studying with Nicky,” he sounded surprised, “he’s Agatha’s kid, so of course he’s smart. I just thought I’d have to separate them more.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because he’s Agatha’s son?” Rio raised an eyebrow questioningly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony suddenly remembered that Rio was dating Agatha but didn’t let his demeanor change.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s your girlfriend. Tell me I’m wrong to think that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had hoped he would reply that way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did Pepper worry that Morgan would run through teenage boys like you ran through women?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Shock crossed Tony’s face before he was able to control it. He had not been expecting that from her. “Okay, maybe I deserved that”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicky is a great kid, Tony. I’m sorry for whatever past transpired with you and Agatha but, it’s been years. More importantly, it has nothing to do with Nicky. Leave the kid out of it, please..” She was still smiling, and her tone was still very friendly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony felt zero animosity towards Rio, even though he knew he should.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They’re still teenagers. What about him wanting to drive?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Didn’t you at that age? Or did you want your dad’s drivers watching your every move? He just got his license, Tony. It’s one of the few times he can drive other minors without an adult. Yes, they’re teenagers. Smart ones that were raised well. Pepper did a good job with Morgan, and Wanda had a fabulous influence on Nicky.” Rio knew that while Tony found Agatha difficult to work with, he adored Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony nodded as Morgan burst out of the gym doors, waving to the other girls on the team and walking to where her father and teacher stood, eyeing them both. “Does this mean I failed?” Her eyes darted between both of them nervously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, you’re grounded.” Tony said, and Rio answered, “You crushed it, Morgan!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Tony and rolled her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, you did a great job, Maguna. I’m proud of you.” Tony smiled at his daughter. Tony, an arrogant Hollywood heir and proud dad. He turned to Rio and let out a defeated sigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m only doing this because you made a compelling argument.” he turned back to the sixteen-year-old, who looked at him questioningly. “Call your boyfriend and tell him to look decent for the dance on Saturday.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan’s face lit up as she hugged her dad and then Rio before leading her dad away, telling him about the dance’s theme before calling Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled as she walked back to her classroom before meeting up with Alice. They both were staying late. She entered her classroom as she received a text and grinned.
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      Rio shouldn’t have been surprised. Teenagers were fast, and of course, he had already messaged Agatha about it.

      Agatha sent the text and had been so close to typing something else but didn’t. Not before she told Rio everything, especially not in a text, that was immature and stupid. No, she pushed that feeling down and back into its box where it needed to stay. Instead, she typed something much safer.

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was still smiling as she put her phone in her pocket. She gathered her backpack and lunchbox when she heard footsteps.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Almost ready, Alice,” She said, turning as her eyes landed on Lilia. “Oh, Ms. Calderu! I thought you’d have left by now.” It was five, and while it was finals week, Rio expected teachers and coaches to be at school, not her boss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia gave her a polite smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes as she took her usual spot on top of a desk and gestured for Rio to sit. Rio was automatically filled with panic as Lilia never stayed for very long as she perched on a stool.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I saw you speaking with Tony Stark.” It was a statement, not a question.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, ma’am, Nicky wanted to take…” Rio was interrupted by Lilia before she could explain.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know the situation.” Lilia crossed her legs at the knee, clasping her hands over where they connected. This woman had to be psychic, how could she know already too?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, I’m happy for you both and the way you handled Tony. Only a few can do so, myself included. Just remember that you have to put your own oxygen mask on first. Has Agatha put hers on?” She stood up and glided towards the open door before turning back to Rio, “I’m sorry if I worried you, but you already had that heavy backpack on, and I didn’t want you to hurt your back. You’re rubbing the left side of your chest. It’s your tell when you're nervous.” She turned back to the door, “See you at the dance on Saturday. Tell Agatha to wear a shirt under her suit. Four school days to go!” She called as she left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat on the stool for a few minutes. Oxygen masks? Has Agatha put hers on? The fuck? She blew a breath out between her lips as Alice came in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What was that about? I saw Calderu come out of here.” She gestured with her head for them both to leave.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rose from the stool and followed Alice out of the building. She recapped what Lilia had said, even about her nervous stim.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, you always do that as a self-soothing technique. Since we were kids.” Alice noted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What do you think she means?” Rio asked as she put her seatbelt on and started the car.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice just shrugged. “Who knows? She’s known Agatha forever and knows everything in general anyway. The vague comments don’t help.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thought as she drove. Lilia’s sporadic appearances and cryptic ‘advice’ were slightly unnerving to her. She shrugged it off. The next Tuesday would be the last day of school for the semester, and they would have a break. She could work through whatever this was then. “You’re right, Nicky’s gone to SHIELD since Pre-K.” She acknowledged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, Lilia and Agatha were friends before then.” Alice supplied as she texted Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow. She vaguely remembered Alice mentioning that once but had forgotten the context.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Before SHIELD was as big as it is, not that it’s huge, some teachers would privately tutor child stars. Lilia was one of Agatha’s teachers. That’s how Lilia hooked Agatha up with the right lawyers during the trial when Agatha was sixteen.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice reminded Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had forgotten that Lilia had been the one to help Agatha out all those lifetimes ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, right. She does know a lot about Agatha then. No wonder she’s been dropping random things this semester and winning so many of the dating pool bets.” Rio laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Bitch won the whole damn thing because she knows your story too!” Alice groaned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sorry, there, sister-friend. No one beats Lilia Calderu, apparently.”

      Finals week had ended and things had gone well. Rio and Agatha hadn’t seen each other since Tuesday and Rio felt very teenage girl about it. She had just gotten home and set her school bag down when she heard the text alert.
     </span>

      Rio looked around at her home, she didn’t have any chores to do, and laundry was caught up. Taking Raven was such a hassle though, it was like packing for an infant. She also needed to start keeping clothes at Agatha’s.

</p>

      Agatha then sent pictures of a litterbox, and the pet cameras that were already set up in various rooms so Rio could still check on the cat, auto feeder, and Raven’s food. Rio was impressed as she felt her heart melt. This woman knew exactly how to get to her.

      time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Hadn’t Agatha figured out by now that she had won Rio over? She was right about Raven, though. Even if Rio checked in on the ancient cat while she was at Agatha’s. She smiled as she went to pack her bag.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Raven wasn’t happy about the car ride, but when she found Nicky’s room, she forgave Rio. Rio dropped her bag and dress off in Agatha’s room and returned to the kitchen, where Agatha had dinner ready.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is Nicky at the clubhouse?” Rio gave Agatha a chaste kiss as she took their plates to the table.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grabbed their drinks and followed, “No, he took Morgan out on a date.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had a look of shock on her face as she placed their plates on the table and lowered herself to her seat. “A date tonight AND a dance tomorrow? I AM good!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let out a breathy laugh, “According to Pepper, Morgan told Tony she REALLY likes Nicky, so they are going on a double date. Chaperoned by Tony and Pepper.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio placed her hand over her mouth as she tried to suppress her laughter, and failed. “Oh no, poor Nicky.” Rio let out in between breaths.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s laughter was contagious, and Agatha began to laugh as well. “He made Nicky drive so he could judge his skills,” Agatha added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s laughter died down, “The poor boy. That will cause anxiety.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had taken a bite of the steak taco she had made and was still chewing as she nodded and swallowed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He was still muttering ‘hands at ten and two’ when he left.” She looked at Rio’s plate, “How are you finished? You were talking and laughing!” She exclaimed, laughing herself. She was adjusting to Rio’s quirks and found them adorable.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged, “It just happens! Raven helped, too.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked down to see the cat gazing up at her, licking her lips. “You’re worse than a dog.” She remarked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Those are fighting words,” Rio retorted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha found that being with Rio was easy. Their conversations, banter, choosing movies, and even just how they fit together when they sat and cuddled. It had been this way since they met, and Agatha knew how rare that was. Even when they made…uh had sex, everything came easily. It was like they already knew each other’s bodies and preferences. Agatha had never truly believed in the concept of soulmates. That theory had been shot down when she was young.

       They had been lying in bed at Sword’s ‘secret’ apartment where they would meet. Agatha was 25 and traced the older woman’s collarbone with her fingers as their eyes met. Swords was actually looking at her lovingly, and Agatha blushed.

       Swords’ eyes filled with sadness for Agatha as she suddenly sat up and looked at her, gathering the blankets in front of her naked chest.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Agatha, we are not soulmates.” She said firmly.

</p>

       Agatha looked away. She had sat up as well, pulling her knees close to her chest. “I didn’t say that we were. I was just asking what your thoughts were on the subject.” Agatha had fixed her expression and no longer felt like she would cry as she turned back to look at the woman she had loved for years.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I don’t believe in soulmates, Agatha.” Swords said as if she were slamming a door closed on a conversation. Her face softened a bit.

<p>
<em>

      Rio shifted in Agatha’s arms as she slept, bringing Agatha out of her memories. The slants of moonlight highlighted the scars on Rio’s side. Agatha lightly ran her fingers along Rio’s ribcage, causing her to nuzzle further into Agatha. Agatha was having a difficult time finding sleep as she was plagued with guilt. She pulled Rio closer and whispered.
     </span>

      The coven had arrived to chaperone the winter formal before the boys did and had taken the opportunity to speak with other parents. When the boys and their dates arrived, the coven had taken pictures, much to the teens’ dismay. Morgan’s dark brown hair was down in tight curls, and she wore a strapless floor-length red dress with black heels. Tommy’s date, Cassie Lang, had her light brown hair pulled up, her green halter dress stopped just below the knee, and with black ballet flats. The boys wore black suits and bowties that matched their date’s dresses. Billy and Eddie complemented each other in shades of blue.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The dance went well. Rio did her best to sing loudly and embarrass her students. For a few minutes, no one could find four of the six teens, but they returned, saying they had gone to the restroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched as the students got too close to each other or tried to sneak off to dark corners, and she went to haul them back to a more populated area.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed. “Is this what teaching is like?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know, it’s not much different. With this age group, it really is 65% keeping them from touching each other.” Rio laughed as she shot a look at a few students lingering by the refreshments.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thankfully, these guys aren’t huge into fighting,” Alice added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I fought a lot,” Nat remembered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shocker,” Wanda smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re all standing too close. Leave room for Jesus.” Jen barked, causing Wanda and Nat to step apart, Alice to roll her eyes, and Agatha to pull Rio into her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The last song, a slow song popular with the kids, played when Agatha noticed that Nicky had pulled something out of his pocket. He saw that his mom was watching him, so he grinned and rolled his eyes toward the ceiling, clicking the button. Pounds of white glitter, confetti, streamers, and feathers shot out of cannons above them. While the sounds were startling, once it was discovered what was happening, people laughed, throwing handfuls of confetti and glitter at each other. It was a harmless prank, though a few people slipped, but nothing too bad, Agatha thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned toward Wanda, “These are the pranks I can handle.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda sighed, “I was worried about them stealing chemicals from Rio’s lab.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky and Tommy had overheard them as they walked up, both looking hurt at the admission.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We would never do that Mom! Well, not to Rio, specifically.” Nicky said as Tommy nodded. Agatha hugged them all as everything ended, and the gym lights came back on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re decent kids,” Agatha told them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just decent?” Nicky grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t push it,” She said sarcastically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can I drive everyone home, Mom? I promise to drive the girls and Eddie straight home and then the three of us, please? I have Mr. Stark’s permission. If it’s okay with the other parents?” Nicky asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked over at Wanda. She knew that Nicky was a rather safe driver and had become pretty responsible, minor pranks aside. “I’m okay with it, Wanda?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I trust him with the twins. Just make sure the other adults agree.” Wanda nodded, her voice slightly nervous as she looked at Nat, who squeezed her hand and nodded in agreement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha inhaled deeply before turning to Rio. She knew this was an important step, and she could easily twist it to be less than what it actually was. “Thoughts? These are your kids, after all, and I know you care about them. You also know Nicky’s reaction times.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was slightly shocked, this wasn’t her decision to make, and she saw through Agatha’s facade. Agatha was sharing a parenting decision with Rio and testing the waters.
     </span>
</p>

<span>
      “Nicky can handle five other people in the car and tune out distractions if you ask my professional opinion. As your girlfriend, I say let him have this.” She smiled and kissed Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Eddie and Cassie’s parents had agreed, and the six teens left. They were in a rather large, safe SUV, and no one was too worried as the roads were dry, and even though it was dark, the sky was clear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The women had stayed to help clean up as Lilia pulled Agatha aside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s been hurt, and if you’re not completely honest with her, it will only cause more damage.” The older woman mused as she swept up glitter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha scoffed. “What would you know about honesty?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve grown a lot as I’ve aged. Now, if you’ll excuse me, your son’s prank caused a few slight injuries. Glitter and eyeballs don’t mix, and I need to find Jen and do damage control.” Lilia handed the broom and dustpan to Agatha and hurried away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked after her and shook her head as Wanda drew up beside her. “What was that about?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Our sons’ prank caused minor eye damage. A few kids got glitter in their eyes.” Agatha said flatly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shrugged, “We’ve had glitter in our eyes plenty of times. I’m more worried about the kids that slipped on feathers.” Wanda looked around. Everyone was fine and had a good time, and no one was seriously injured. “Lilia’s just bent out of shape because she didn’t catch them first.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha half-smirked. “She does hate it when they get one over on her.”
     </span>
</p>

<p>
<span>

     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were back at Agatha’s, comfortable clothes on, as Jen ranted about having to talk a few parents down from their precious babies having glitter in their eyes or slipping on something.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s glitter! They’re always around glitter! These kids are idiots! They’re more likely to do something a hundred times dumber at school. Most of them were laughing about it!” Her hands were flying through the air as Alice sat next to her, drinking some fancy craft beer, trying not to laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Babe, she’s just trying to make sure there are no slip-ups or cracks. She’s been pretty tightly wound since Agatha filled her in on everything.” Alice put a comforting hand on her girlfriend's thigh as Jen relaxed slightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat’s phone rang, and she left the room, speaking quietly in Russian. Wanda and Agatha were straining to hear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think it was cute, and the pictures came out great. Agatha, Rogers sent me this one of us,” Rio leaned over to show Agatha a picture of glitter swirling around them as they looked at each other, laughing. “Peggy took it, obviously.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat came rushing back in. Agatha and Wanda hadn’t been able to hear her side of the conversation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “SF was released this morning. No one knows where she went. She’s not in San Francisco.” She was trying to keep a calm face, but her eyes were full of panic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at her phone to check the time and went back to the others.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why aren’t the boys back? It’s not like them to not check-in.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt dread seep into her bones as her phone rang at the same time Wanda’s did. They locked eyes as they both answered them with shaky hands. They had read the names on their caller IDs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha answered as a nurse explained that Nicky had been in an accident with three other people, two boys and a girl, Morgan.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       She would be the last one to take home
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , Agatha thought. They would get more details at the hospital, but they needed to get there as soon as possible.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had already been on the move once their phones had rung. Nat called Vision to meet them at the hospital as he was out with friends. Jen and Alice were getting keys to the Tahoe so they could all go in one vehicle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat drove, and no one commented on their speed or the fact that zero traffic laws were being obeyed. Wanda sat in front, white-knuckling Nat’s thigh, face pale. Agatha looked like a ghost, and Rio wrapped her arms around her, trying to provide some sort of comfort. Jen and Alice had remained quiet, Jen looking for news stories and searching police scanners.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They ran into the emergency room, where a nurse opened a door and pointed down a hallway to a set of chairs where Pepper sat with Morgan and Tommy. Morgan was wearing a pair of sweats that her parents had most likely brought her and had a small bandage on her forehead. Tommy had taken his suit jacket off, and his shirt had some dried blood on it. He had a few cuts on his face, and his wrist was in an ace bandage. Tony leaned against a wall.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s about fucking time!” Tony Spat. “None of your phones were working!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan nodded. “The boys' phones auto-dialed when we were in the crash, and nothing happened.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tommy jumped from his seat to run to his mom when he heard Tony speak.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mom! It happened so fast, Billy.” He started sobbing into his Mom’s hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked around for the other two boys, grabbing Rio’s hand and clearing the lump in her throat before asking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Where’s Nicky and Billy?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Dad!” Tommy shouted as Vision joined them and hugged his father, still crying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda held on to Nat, not giving a single fuck what anyone saw or thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pepper had started to speak when a doctor came through the double doors and looked at the large group that had gathered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ms. Harkness, Mr. and Mrs. Maximoff, may I speak to the three of you?” The surgeon asked asked them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kept hold of Rio’s hand as she walked a few steps off with him. He introduced himself as Dr. Walker, and Wanda held on to Nat, though Vision told Tommy to remain with the others. Walker lifted an eyebrow at the addition of the other two women but said nothing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ms. Harkness, Nicky received the most impact. When he swerved to miss the other car and was essentially run off the road, the front of the vehicle hit a tree, causing the airbags to inflate. He crossed his arms in front of his face, which, upon impact with the airbags, broke his left arm. He also has scratches from the glass, which were treated. We’re watching his head for any brain bleeding, and he’s in surgery. His appendix ruptured, and he has three broken ribs and a punctured lung. But everything is going well.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wasn’t sure how she was still breathing or standing. Tears were running down her cheeks as she sobbed and turned into Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio held her tightly, tears running down her face as well, but trying to hold it together for Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Dr. Walker looked at the Maximoffs. Wanda was crying for Nicky, her hand on Agatha’s back. “Tommy has a wrist sprain, and he protected the girl, Morgan.” He turned back toward Agatha, “Morgan has a cut above her eye, but that’s it. Make sure to ask her why. You’ll be proud of your son, Ms. Harkness.” He turned back to the three adults before him. “Billy hit his head hard against the glass. He has a pretty serious head injury and is unconscious right now, but he’ll be okay. He’s had stitches, and we’re watching for brain swelling. He’ll need to be here for a day or so.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He nodded to both families and went back to the operating room. Wanda was relieved and felt terrible for feeling that way. They rejoined the others, and Nat relayed the information to everyone. Rio looked at Morgan, her face a giant question mark.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicky wouldn’t let me sit in the front seat. We dropped Cassie and Eddie off, and then he made me get in the back. He said the drive to my place had a potential for deer, and the roads were darker, so no one was allowed to sit up front. Then, when the car came into our lane, and Nicky veered off the road so we wouldn’t hit it, he yelled, ‘Tommy, get Morgan,’ and Tommy grabbed me, which is why his head didn’t go into the glass like Billy’s did. However, I did take some glass to the forehead.” Morgan touched the bandage on her head gingerly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s hand was over her mouth as Pepper stood and hugged her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He’s a good kid, Agatha. He’s going to be okay.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was upset. She was also livid. This wasn’t an accident. It had Lou written all over it. How far gone was she to go after CHILDREN?! Rio looked over at Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you going to have to issue a statement?” Rio’s voice barely over a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen shrugged as she glanced at the multiple parents.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It was a weekend accident with major injuries, so it was on the news. It will depend on what those six want.” Jen always included Nat when she mentioned the parents.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat walked over to Rio and put an arm around her shoulders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I need you for a minute,” she said as she led her off to the side. “I need to go check out the scene, look at all of our phones, but you know…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio interrupted her. “It had to be...” Rio’s phone went off, and she looked at Nat. They both knew who it was.

      They’d be safer without you around.

      My children, our children, were always

<p>
<span>
      A picture of the kids with Rio was attached. Rio knew that the oldest had known, but the other two didn’t. Rio was just a good friend of their mom’s. They had been watching a movie and were all four in a pool, smiling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes filled with tears as she looked at Nat. “I have to tell Agatha myself.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded, “I’m going to track this. I had a feeling.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Much to Morgan’s repeated protests, the Starks departed, though Rio promised to update them. As they left, Tony put his hand on Agatha’s shoulder and leaned close to her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sorry for all the hell I’ve given you, Harkness. He’s a good kid. His decision probably saved my daughter. Keep me updated.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice and Jen had returned to the compound and Nat’s house, conveniently very close to the compound, to get clothes for those staying at the hospital, which would be Wanda, Nat, Agatha, and Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Agatha sat in the cushioned chairs of the waiting room in the early hours of Sunday morning, waiting for Dr. Walker to give them an update. The Maximoffs had been able to see Billy, and while he was groggy, he was okay. He had a few bruises and a head injury, but he would make a full recovery. Once he had seen that his brother was okay, Vision was able to talk Tommy into going home and resting. Vision assured him that the best he could do for everyone was to go to Agatha’s and take care of Raven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky had taken the majority of the damage.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was nervous but knew she had to tell Agatha that this was essentially her fault. She sighed as she squeezed Agatha’s hand. “Aggie?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s not your fault,” Agatha said automatically, voice full of care as she turned to look at Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was taken aback, “You don’t even know what I was going to say.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nat told us Satan was released this morning, and then we got a call. It wasn’t that hard to do the math, babe. Then you and Nat went off to talk, and you’ve been nervous since. What did the text say?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio showed her the text, and Agatha rolled her lips, keeping them in a thin line.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s not your fault,” Agatha repeated as she squeezed Rio’s hand. At that time, Dr. Walker came out, and Agatha stood and met him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ms. Harkness, Nicky is going to be fine and make a full recovery.”

      Rio had called Lilia early Sunday morning and taken the two days of that week off, starting her winter break early. Lilia had understood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Even the strongest of towers need support, especially during storms,” Lilia had said. That message, Rio had understood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was in a private ICU room, though considering who his mom was, the limited number of guests had been wavered. He was being kept in a medically induced coma for a day while his lung was being monitored, and Agatha sat at his side. Nat walked in and flopped on the couch next to Wanda with a defeated sigh. It was just the four women and Nicky in the room, and they could speak freely.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s bouncing her signal all over the place, so I can’t locate her. A cell tower was mysteriously down which caused our phones not to take calls for a bit last night. All I know is she’s not in the country.” Nat explained angrily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      All eyes turned to Rio, who shook her head, “She has multiple places to hide. She was always good with investments. Shane too. So even with the divorce, that’s not an issue.” She explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How’d she get released?” Wanda asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good lawyers and technicalities,” Nat answered. “No evidence of child endangerment apparent. She signed all of her rights over to Shane. There’s no hard evidence that it was her last night. It’s all circumstantial. I’ve reached out to some former contacts that are more global. They all have very specific orders.” She finished, looking at Agatha seriously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. “Good. Right now, I’ll make it through the winter if it kills me.”
     </span>
</p>

      Rio was starting to worry that it might, if Nat didn’t find Lou soon.

      Billy was released on Monday, and Nicky was released the day after. The news had leaked, and Jen had released a statement on behalf of the family. An unknown driver had run Nicky off the road, and Nicky used his best judgment. All passengers were safe, and all parents were very grateful that it wasn’t worse. The families asked that everyone respect their privacy at the time. The Starks made a similar statement adding that Nicky had made sure Morgan was sitting in the back to begin with and had made sure everyone was as safe as possible.

<span>
      It was too much for Rio. Comments were all over the place, and she needed to stop reading them. Her own socials were flooded, asking if everyone was okay. Why were people so parasocial all of a sudden? She shook her head and looked over at Agatha, who was asleep and curled in a ball on the couch. It was Tuesday afternoon, and they had just gotten Nicky settled in a guest room on the first floor. He wasn’t thrilled, but he needed to wait until his ribs weren’t as tender before climbing the stairs several times a day. Raven had been annoyed that they had left her in a house she wasn’t used to, but upon realizing Nicky was hurt, she curled up next to him and stayed there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew Agatha needed a shower and actual sleep in her bed. They had eaten a late lunch, so that was one need out of the way. Rio stood and placed a hand on Agatha’s shoulder. “Aggie, honey.” She said as she shook her slightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What?” Agatha grumbled, eyes still closed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicky’s going to sleep for a while. Let’s get you cleaned up and in an actual bed, up you go.” Rio helped her up as Agatha stretched and lazily draped an arm over Rio’s shoulders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio guided them up the stairs, through Agatha’s bedroom, and into the bathroom. They had taken quick showers at some point at the hospital, but Rio didn’t think that counted as really getting clean. That was removing a basic layer of germs. She opened the door to the large walk-in shower and turned the water on to get the temperature just the right side of molten lava they both liked while they both undressed. When the water began to steam, Rio took Agatha's hand and led her into the shower, turning Agatha to face her. Agatha groaned as the hot water hit the muscles in her neck and shoulders, where she had built up tension from the past few days.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t realize how tight everything was,” Agatha said softly as Rio ran her hands through Agatha’s hair to make sure it was wet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You've been holding a lot in. Keeping a mask on for everyone else.” Rio said honestly as she turned Agatha around and began to wash her hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was taken aback. No one was ever this candid with her. Here Rio was, caring for her in such an intimate way, calling her out in a way no one else would dare to do.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Pardon?” Agatha said with a French accent as Rio massaged her scalp, and Agatha let a moan slip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You heard me. I watch you, Agatha. As much as you watch everybody else. You were terrified, and rightfully so.” She rinsed the shampoo from Agatha’s hair and began to repeat the cycle with conditioner. “That’s your son, baby. You had every right to scream, cry, yell, throw things. You remained calm and strong for everyone around you.” Rio let the conditioner sit as she put body wash on a loofah and began to clean Agatha’s body thoroughly. “We are here for you, baby.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      am here for you. Let me be the one to comfort you. Let me be the one you cry on.” Rio rinsed the conditioner from Agatha’s hair before moving to rinse the soap from Agatha’s body. “Let me take care of you in the good times and the bad.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt like a dam within her would burst, and every feeling, guarded thought, and memory would come flooding out toward Rio. She couldn’t let that happen. Instead, she turned around and brought Rio in for a searing kiss underneath the still-hot water of the shower. She needed Rio at that moment, and she showed it with her lips and her tongue while her hands ran over Rio’s slickened body. She was not expecting Rio to pull back and drive the tip of a finger into her chest. Agatha looked at Rio, shocked, lips parted, water still streaming down both of them.

      “No, you do not get to run and hide from your feelings with sex.” Rio was staring into Agatha as if reading her mind. “We will finish this shower, dry off, get dressed, and then I will hold you while you talk about your feelings and process like a healthy adult,” Rio spoke sternly, and it both annoyed Agatha and turned her on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fine,” Agatha said curtly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And you call me a brat?” Rio teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were sitting in the bed in lounge clothes. Nicky had been checked on and was still asleep with his feline protector. Rio was sitting with her back against the headboard, Agatha’s head on her shoulder as Rio stroked her hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, talk.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s just a lot. I don’t blame you at all. You cannot control what that psycho does.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha really did not blame Rio. Would this have happened if she and Rio weren’t dating? No. Did she want a life where she wasn’t dating Rio? No. What she wanted was a world where Lou Falco wasn’t a problem, and she had people working on that. She had learned a long time ago that she couldn’t control everything or what other people did. She could, however, arrange for those people to be taken care of.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The important part is that I raised my son to be mindful of his surroundings and to think. It could have been so much worse. Vision taught him well, too. I’m not discounting that man's driving lessons. I sent him out in a tank of a vehicle, and that was absolutely the correct choice. He didn’t want to take any other car.” She chuckled, “He said Tony would want her in the safest vehicle we own, Mom.” She mimicked her son.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s good that you can acknowledge all of that, babe. Thank you for not blaming me. I blame myself. I know I brought this all down on everyone.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No. She made that decision. You did nothing.” Agatha yawned. “My biggest fear is losing Nicky and then the people I love and care for. This is the closest I’ve ever gotten to that, and it was terrifying.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wasn’t sure when she started to cry, but she knew there were tears on Rio’s shirt now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was afraid. Afraid for everyone else, but also because I love those kids, especially Nicky. He truly means a lot to me, Agatha.” Rio finished with a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The gravity of the admittance hit Agatha right in the heart. Agatha knew how she felt for Rio, but she had to tell her everything, and this just wasn’t quite the right time for that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank you for being there with me and not leaving my side. Only Wanda and Nat have done that for me. Thank you, that means so much.” Agatha sat up and looked at Rio. “I can do anything with YOU by MY side, Rio.” Agatha kissed her softly before settling into the bed and pulling Rio down with her, laying back on Rio’s shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Now, what do you want for Christmas?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The following week leading up to Christmas was full of adjustments and healing. Until Nicky’s ribs felt better, he had to stay downstairs, and the twins spent more time at Agatha’s instead of everyone being at the Clubhouse. Tommy’s wrist had healed quickly and Billy’s injury was starting to fade. Morgan hung out too, not because she felt obligated, but because she genuinely wanted to. Throw in Eddie and Cassie, and Agatha felt like her home was turning into a teenage hangout.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This is literally why we have a separate house for them,” Agatha bemoaned while sitting in Wanda’s living room two days before Christmas. “I don’t like it here as much.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda rolled her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re just mad because you and Rio haven’t had much alone time.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’ve spent most of our time at Rio’s but come back at night. Still, I’d like for there not to be six children eating me out of house and home.” Agatha said as she wrapped a present for Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey! I foot half that bill, thank you!” Wanda laughed as she threw a gift bow at her sister.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat walked into the room at the separate piles of gifts and the mounds of gift-wrapping paraphernalia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I still don’t see why you two don’t just wrap a few things yourselves and hire someone else to do the rest. You know, like all your other famous friends do?” Nat mused before sitting down and grabbing a present to help. “Where’s everyone else?” She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Jen and Alice are packing and showing Jen’s house, I think is what they said?” Wanda answered as she finished another gift and placed it in the Billy stack.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio said she had things to do at her place.” Agatha shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Vision is playing racquetball with Herb but should be home soon,” Wanda added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Never beating the dating allegations,” Nat smirked as she wrote on a gift tag.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I wonder what Rio got you for Christmas, Aggie?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda grinned and looked at Agatha. She was looking forward to seeing someone who was actually dating Agatha give her a gift. Wanda had never witnessed it before. From what she could remember, Agatha’s secret girlfriend never gave her anything, and if she had, Agatha had never talked about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She doesn’t have to give me a present.” Agatha kept wrapping gifts, partially ignoring the looks of the other two.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s so hard getting gifts for women that have or can buy anything they want or need,” Nat spoke from experience.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You are not to get me anything for Christmas. We file the divorce papers, and then it’s our personal Christmas.” Wanda said, looking at Nat as if she were prey.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am well aware.” Nat returned the same look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am literally right here. Not waiting until it’s finalized there, kids?” Agatha raised an eyebrow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’ll wait for it to be finalized before we get engaged. However, it’s been 20 years, so, no.” Wanda said, voice serious.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, we’ll make sure to be nowhere near here.” Agatha grinned. “You better still get this one an actual present though. You know she’ll pout if you don’t,” Agatha added, looking at Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat just looked at the task at hand and smiled as Wanda shot Agatha a look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stood at her kitchen table with her project spread in front of her. All of her presents were wrapped, and this was the last thing she had left to complete. Agatha’s present was ninety-nine percent completed, and she was putting the final touches on it. She wrote one final word on the last page before putting it together and wrapping it. She was nervous but couldn’t wait to give it to Agatha. It would either go incredibly well or burst into flames. She cleaned up the table, threw trash away, and put the scissors, glue, tape, and other supplies back where they belonged. They would be spending the next few days at Agatha’s and she had replenished the clothes in her duffel and gathered all the gifts in a bag. Raven was still at Agatha’s as the feline refused to move from Nicky’s side unless necessary. She was often curled up next to his ribs as if she were trying to heal them faster. Nicky told Raven she was helping.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio loaded everything in the wagon she used to take things to the car so she didn’t have to make more than one trip. She was getting ready to leave when someone knocked. She froze as she wasn’t expecting anyone. She really needed to get a video doorbell or start tracking everyone. “Who is it?” Rio called as she walked cautiously toward the door, picking up a potted plant in case she needed to smash it over someone’s head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s Jen, and I’ll use my key if I have to,” Jen called back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio released a breath she didn’t realize she was holding as she unlocked and opened the door. Jen’s eyes immediately went down to the plant.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Were you going to fend someone off with a love fern?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s not a love fern, and if needed, yes.” Rio sat the plant back down as she let Jen in, closing and locking the door behind her. “Why didn’t you text or call?” Rio asked as Jen stood in front of the couch. She looked nervous, and Jennifer Kale was never nervous. “Jen? Sit.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen sat, her leg bouncing. This was not the calm, cool, and collected Jen that Rio was used to. “Is it Alice? Is she okay?” Rio sat down next to Jen, turning to look at her, concern etched on her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes. Yes, it’s Alice, and yes, she’s okay, it’s just…” Jen’s voice shook, and she looked like she was going to cry. Rio put a hand on Jen’s for comfort.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Breathe, Jen. Do you need water? A beer? Anything.” Rio offered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen took three deep breaths, regaining her composure. “No, I’m okay. I brought Alice back to her apartment, and I was going to leave but I made a last-minute decision. You’re the closest thing Alice has to family, and it’s old-fashioned and stupid, but I do love her, and I have for years.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen’s face was soft and tears were forming. Rio realized that she had tears of her own forming. She knew what was coming, and at the same time, she was shocked that Jen was in front of her, giving her this speech.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen locked eyes with Rio and continued.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I promise that I’ll take care of her, and if I don’t, you may send Nat after me. Can I have your blessing to marry Alice?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While it was a serious moment, Rio couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “I am so sorry, Jen, it’s just, you are the last person I imagined would ask for someone’s hand in marriage, just because it’s such a patriarchal thing and you are so, not that,” Rio said, hand clasped over her mouth, trying to reign it in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen scoffed, “You’re not wrong. If it weren’t you, I wouldn’t. However, given your relationship and that you’re all the family she has, it felt right.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It does feel right. Yes, you have my blessing and/or curse to marry my sister. However, you have to do it with the right ring.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stood up and turned toward her room, motioning for Jen to follow her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was going to ask you to look at what I had narrowed it down to.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No. I have the rings. Gran left us her wedding set. Her husband died when Alice was young. I never met him. When Gran got sick, we had strict instructions to keep the rings; whoever married first was to get them, and the other was supposed to give them to whoever proposed. So,” Rio had entered her closet, found where the safe was hidden, entered the code, grabbed the ring boxes, closed, locked, and concealed the safe and reappeared. She handed Grandpa Wu’s ring to Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She wants to be proposed to with this one.” Rio handed Jen a white gold band that was inlaid with fire opal. The inside of the band was engraved with ‘full of fire’.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen turned the ring over in her hand before looking back at Rio suspiciously, “I don’t think Gramps had fingers this small.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled slyly, “I had a feeling this was coming and already had it sized.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen gently shoved Rio’s shoulder, “Look at you, you big softy.” Her eyes fell on Gran’s set of rings. “What about those?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “These, I will be keeping in case Alice wants to use them,” Rio said as she went to put them back in the hidden safe. When she returned, she let Jen know that Alice did not want a proposal made in front of the family or on a holiday. “She thinks it’s cliche,” Rio explained. “She wants private. Intimate.” She offered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen took the advice before hugging Rio. Jen wasn’t much of a hugger, but this deserved a hug. “Thanks, Rio. I’m not sure when it will happen, but I know it will be soon.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen departed as Rio pulled the wagon full of presents and clothes down to the car and drove back to Agatha’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Christmas morning had been a fun kind of chaotic. Everyone would gather at Agatha’s that afternoon to eat and exchange gifts, though the two families currently living at the compound did their Christmas mornings separately. Nicky had gotten everything he wanted, including a car, as long as he kept his grades up and the troublemaking to a harmless minimum. Nicky had gotten Rio a coffee cup as a gag gift that said “#1 Stepdad”. His serious gift to her was a signed Phoenix Mercury jersey and a framed picture of all of them from the concert, and he had gotten Raven, a pillow for his bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky left the room to attempt to play video games with one arm, so Agatha and Rio could exchange presents alone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They looked at each other, cheeks turning red. Rio had always been embarrassed when she bought or created things for SF.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Open yours first.” The women said at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They both smiled, blushing slightly. Agatha had given Swords things over the years but had never received them with genuine gratitude. Agatha always felt like she was being humored, and her gifts were not those of a lover.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Here,” Agatha said, practically shoving two boxes into Rio’s hands.”You first,”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were sitting on the floor next to the tree, and Rio turned so she was sitting cross-legged, facing Agatha. Agatha mirrored her. Rio peeled back a layer of gift wrap and revealed a black jewelry box. Opening the box, Rio pulled out a silver chain with a shooting star charm on it. “For our first date,” Rio smiled, looking up at Agatha as Rio turned it over in her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, but also, it’s part of my promise to keep you safe. You can click it like a button, and no matter where you are, Nat can track you, just in case,” Agatha added solemnly. They had been on edge, and this provided them a sense of security.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love it, and thank you for the added features. That means a lot.” Rio tilted her chin up as she leaned forward and gave Agatha a chaste kiss on the lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio opened the other box and pulled out two framed charts. One was a star map that had November 28, 2024, written across the top, and at the bottom, it read ‘The Night A Wish Came True’. Rio looked up at Agatha, “Thanksgiving? That was a terrible day.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave her an emotional smile. “Yes. However, my wish for you to be mine came true that day. It’s when you said you wanted actually to do this with me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A tear rolled down Rio’s cheek, “Only you could take a bad memory and make it happy, Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at the other frame. It was another star map with a specific star labeled. At the top, it read ‘The Vidal Star’ and gave the coordinates of a star near the Cancer constellation. Rio began to laugh, a genuine one that turned into a giggle. “It’s the anti-death star!” She finally said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked, “I knew you’d like it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s giggles faded as she cupped Agatha’s cheek. “Baby, I love it all,” and kissed her. Agatha pulled away before Rio could go further.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, I have to tell you one more thing, and then I will open the present from you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, motioning for Agatha to continue.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I cleaned out some space in my dresser and closet. Will you keep some of your clothes here? Please? For impromptu sleepovers?” Agatha’s eyes were questioning, searching Rio’s glassy ones. Rio nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Who knew playboy Agatha Harkness was a romantic?” Rio joked, wiping another tear away as her heart expanded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I sure as hell didn’t,” Agatha responded in a whisper, pressing their foreheads together. They stayed like that for a moment before Rio broke the silence.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have nothing as amazing as any of that but here.” Rio handed Agatha a large box.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha unwrapped it carefully and opened the box, taking out a scrapbook. On the front was a picture of Agatha and Rio from the premiere, and letters spelled out ‘The Story of Us’. Agatha looked up, “This all about us?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave a slightly embarrassed smile. “I didn’t know what to get the woman who has everything or can buy anything she needs or wants. So, I made this. Open it.” Rio gestured towards it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could already feel the tears forming as she opened the front cover with a picture of Agatha cheering at a football game. Rio had written various lyrics, what she loved about Agatha, and different things that had been said or that happened around the picture. There were several solo pictures, pictures of both of them that had things she loved about them, pictures with Nicky, and pictures of them with their friends. Each page had lyrics, quotes, and things that she loved about Agatha or them that pertained to the picture.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I love the way you make me giggle.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I love how protective you are of those you care about.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I love the way we always wake up holding each other.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I love how you look like a chipmunk when you chew.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I love how you kiss me.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I love how your eyes sparkle when you look at me.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I love how down-to-earth you are.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I love how involved you are with Nicky.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I love the way you and Jen bicker and how it’s never really mean.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The song lyrics were a mix of everything, and Agatha enjoyed them, too. The last page was a picture of just Agatha, one that she hadn’t even been aware Rio had taken. It was at the Halloween party. Agatha was dressed as Moiraine, and she looked over at Rio standing next to her. Agatha’s face and eyes lit up. The emotion was plain as day, though they wouldn’t call it what it was. This page held promises from Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I will always stand beside you.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I will always care about you.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I will never become a stranger whose laugh you recognize anywhere.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I will never leave the toilet seat up.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I will always walk the red carpet with you.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There were a few blank spaces. Agatha wondered why but didn’t ask. She closed the book and realized she was crying as she looked at Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio reached out and wiped the tears away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio,” Agatha whispered, “No one has ever done anything like that for me. It’s beautiful.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m glad you like it,” Rio whispered back. “Merry Christmas, Aggie.” Rio cupped Agatha’s jaw and pressed her lips to Agatha’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Merry Christmas!” Billy said as he walked into the house carrying presents.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned. “Why? Why do we do everything at my house?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Presents had been exchanged, dinner had been eaten and cleaned up, and everything was going well. Vision, Tommy, Nicky, Alice, and Nat were deep into a football game in the living room, Billy and Jen were discussing awards season on the end of one couch, and Agatha, Rio, and Wanda were sitting at the kitchen table talking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Jen is going to propose to Alice,” Rio said conspiratorily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s about damn time,” Wanda replied, sipping wine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not surprised it’s Kale doing it first. Control freak.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The other two women chuckled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio noticed Wanda was wearing a new necklace and gestured towards it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Your gift from Nat?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded, “Yes, it’s also a tracker if I push it.” Wanda turned to Agatha. “Like Rio’s, I assume?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shrugged. “We’re protective of our women around here.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled. She liked being Agatha’s and being protected by her. She thought it was sweet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stiffened when she received a text.

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A shiver went down Rio’s spine as if she had been drenched with ice water. She looked around her as Nat walked in, and Agatha took Rio’s hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m tracking, but the signal is bouncing everywhere. I don’t think she’s in the country.”

      better than last year baby.

</p>
<p>

      Rio looked at Agatha with wide eyes. “What does that mean?” She wondered out loud. The other adults had come into the kitchen as the boys had been instructed to stay in the other room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Tell her it is better,” Alice scoffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re not wrong,” Rio confirmed.

</p>

      Nat looked around and put her finger to her lips, and found a notepad and pen. She wrote down, ‘she can hear us somehow, no one say anything’. Everyone nodded.

<span>
      The texts stopped and Nat looked around the house for a potential bug. Wanda wrote out on the notepad. ‘FUCKING HOLIDAY CRASHER’.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Thirty minutes later, everyone had moved to the living room when every phone went off with notifications, texts, and phone calls. News articles, requests for interviews, requests for statements from Jen texts from friends.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pictures from the past twenty-five years were everywhere: Wanda and Natasha holding hands, kissing, looking at each other. If it was slightly compromising, it was there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was scrolling furiously through article after article, “How did she get these pictures?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Aren’t they only on our phones and computers?” Agatha asked brows furrowed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Something is not right,” Nat muttered as she swore in several different languages.

<p>

      Wanda was shocked and looked at the notifications in horror. She silenced call after call and ignored the texts and messages. Vision’s lips were a thin line, and his face was paler than normal. Nat was speaking fluent Russian, and it was more threatening than it normally sounded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was suffocating. She knew this was her fault. It was Christmas. CHRISTMAS. They had been CELEBRATING.

<span>
      a much better Christmas.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Look at all the pain and
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      suffering you’re causing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked up from where the message had been mirrored on her phone as she crossed over to Rio and kneeled in front of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nyet. It is not your fault. We knew we had flown too close to the sun with this, and there was a giant possibility it would come out before it was announced. Does this suck? Yes. Do NOT let this psychopath get in your head, okay? These were her decisions, not yours.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat spoke with conviction, and Rio didn’t dare go against her or doubt a single thing she said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha loved how her friends had embraced Rio and didn’t blame her for anything. Agatha pulled Rio against her side. “I promise to always be beside you.” Agatha whispered in Rio’s hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat had gone back to Wanda’s side. Wanda looked up and at every single face, one by one.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What do we do now?” Wanda asked, her green eyes questioning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at the redhead, “It’s up to you, superstar.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was afraid you were going to say that,” Wanda grumbled. “It’s just so much easier when you take charge.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know angel, but you all have to decide this. Do you want to post a statement right now? Do you want Jen to reply to something? File divorce papers first thing in the morning? Go on a talk show after the first of the year? There are a lot of options.” Agatha was formulating a plan as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda thought as she looked over at Nat, Vision, and the boys, and then at the women who hadn’t been in hiding.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t want to hide anymore. I’m done hiding. Vision, are you okay if Jen makes a statement to People? I’ll post to my socials tonight, and we’ll file in the morning?” It was a lot all at once, but she was ready to get the ball rolling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision grinned. “You’ve learned quite a bit from your sister. Yes, darling, that all sounds great. Boys, we’re going to the cabin in Lake Tahoe tomorrow. Don’t ask questions. Nicky, you’re coming with us. No, you can’t do any winter sports.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys took that as a cue to leave, mumbling about adults being gross and the twins stopping to say they agreed with the plan and they were proud of everyone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked at Wanda, “Are you sure?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. “I’m not waiting any longer. We’re posting, we’ll handle the world, we’ll file the papers that have been ready for over a month, and we’ll kick Agatha and Rio to Rio’s apartment so no one interrupts us. Entire compound to ourselves.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you need the whole…” Agatha started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fuck off, Harkness,” Wanda replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen cleared her throat. “What do you want me to say?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked at her, contemplating, “Wanda and Vision have always done what was in the best interest of the boys. However, the time has come for her to finally live her truth, and they have decided to divorce amicably. Please respect their privacy at this time. Or something like that. I’m going to call Drew. I’ll do an exclusive interview with her. She’s the only one I trust. So, I’ll call Drew, I’ll post, and then you return the call or e-mail from People?” Wanda looked at Jen, hopefully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smiled and nodded. “You have learned from Agatha. Good job.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda blushed. When it came to dealing with the major issues, Agatha always handled them. She turned to Agatha, “So?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her proudly, “That was good, kid. Now get on it. I’m proud of you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While phone calls, texts, and posts were being made, Nat sat next to Rio and took her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s not your fault. I think Wanda is relieved it happened this way.” Nat glanced over at Wanda as she updated her socials, having already set a date with Drew, who had been ecstatic for them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “As for Looney Toons herself, I called in the big guns, and they were able to narrow a small radius in Morocco and have an…acquaintance in the area. I’ll keep you updated.” She looked at Rio and saw the worry and fear in her eyes. “Rio, if I have to neutralize the threat myself, I will. That’s a promise.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Posts are made!” Wanda said triumphantly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat walked back over to Wanda and read one of the posts over her shoulder. Agatha sat back next to Rio so they could read together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Dear World,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It seems that I was outed today, on Christmas of all days. People come out every day, and so many famous people belong to the LGBTQIA+ community these days that it shouldn’t be a big deal. However, because it’s me, and because my public life was as the girl next door with the cute boyfriend, it’s shocking. I would even venture to guess, some of you feel betrayed or lied to. I also have a husband and two amazing boys, which adds to it. All of that was true, and my love for Vision and my family was genuine. While there have always been rumors that I was queer, even some of me with Agatha, you were only partially right. Those of you who started WandaNat, you guessed it. You have to understand that while America embraced Agatha for being a lesbian, my then-agent and PR team did not, and it was too late. I fell in love with Natasha twenty-five years ago and have been madly in love with her ever since.  Still, with Nat’s support, I chose my career. Vision and Nat have both knowingly been integral parts of my life. I love my husband, but we’re not in love. He’s my best friend and an amazing co-parent. There are no hard feelings there, and he’s encouraged me to do this. There was no infidelity, no going behind backs, none of the things I’ve seen insinuated since everything leaked. If I lose roles or fans because of this, that’s fine. I am finally living my truth and being the mother and role model that my sons, and you, deserve. Never sacrifice who you are for your career.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Love,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The Wanda Maximoff.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With it, Wanda had posted various pictures of her and the family, her and Nat, her and the boys, Nat and the boys, and all of them together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love it, Darling.” Vision said, kissing Wanda on the top of her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked at Wanda, arms wrapped around her waist. “Does this mean we’re officially together again?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda laughed, “I think it does.”

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The week between Christmas and New Year’s was marked by social media posts with WandaNat trending most of the week, more articles, divorce papers being filed, and Agatha and Rio taking Raven and spending time at Rio’s apartment for a few days so Wanda and Nat had uninterrupted time. On New Year’s Eve, they were back at Agatha’s, getting ready for a party hosted by Tony.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He does throw great parties.” Agatha was saying as she put her earrings in. “Done, how do I look?” She turned toward Rio, who had been admiring her from where she sat on the bed for the past fifteen minutes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’d look better naked, horizontal, on your back,” Rio said, tongue running along the inside of her cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave her a wicked smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If I wasn’t wearing fresh lipstick, I’d kiss that smirk off your face.” She stood and walked toward Rio. She came to a stop and did a full turn, modeling for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was a simple floor-length halter dress cut down to her navel, champagne-colored silk, with a thigh-high slit on the left side and black stilettos accentuating her calf and thigh muscles. Agatha wore her hair down, parted in the middle, in loose waves with diamond drop earrings.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re gorgeous, as always, baby.” Rio kissed Agatha alongside her jaw, her own lipstick having already set. “If we don’t leave, though, we won’t make it to the party.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t think that’s a bad thing,” Agatha replied, gripping Rio’s hips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stepped back, “C’mon Harkness, we have a new year to usher in.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wore a tight, strapless, black, sparkly dress that hit her mid-thigh. She had paired it with black pumps, pulled her hair up, and worn the necklace Agatha gave her. She hadn’t taken it off since Christmas and, luckily, had earrings that matched it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When they arrived at the party, they met up with the other coven members. Alice excitedly glided towards them in a gold dress.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “LOOK!” She said excitedly as she held up her left hand with the engagement ring firmly planted on her ring finger.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice had called Rio right after, so she and Agatha knew, but she hadn’t been able to hug her yet. She threw her arms around her and squeezed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am so extremely happy for you. I love you so much.” Rio said in her ear, trying not to cry. She released her so the other woman could hug her as Jen approached them with Agatha beside her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Jen, ever gorgeous in her black suit trimmed with gold.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m so happy for both of you. Do anything to hurt her, and I will end you.” She said as she hugged her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at her seriously, “I will never do so intentionally. I promise you that, Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So we have our first engaged couple for the new year,” Agatha said, holding up a flute of champagne that she had picked up off a nearby table as she handed one to Rio. Everyone else picked up one of their own as they toasted to Jen and Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s still…” Wanda started as Agatha held up her hand to stop her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, it counts. The two of you will be next, I call maid of honor. Vision will probably be Nat’s best man because of the very special bond you two have.”Agatha thought aloud as Wanda blushed slightly. The announcement had been surprisingly well received with little backlash. If SF had been trying to ruin Wanda’s career, she failed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat raised an eyebrow and looked at Agatha and Rio, “What about you two?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’re not there yet,” Rio said quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not the marrying type.” Agatha lied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice saw the hurt in Rio’s eyes as Wanda saw the lie in Agatha’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I say we all go dance,” Jen spoke up, shooing everyone towards where the dancing was happening.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys each had their dates, Nicky still with his broken arm, though his ribs were feeling better, which he attributed to a certain magical feline. He and Morgan were dancing to the best of his abilities with his arm in a sling a week and a half after the accident.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you going to be able to play our senior year?” She asked as they danced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky nodded, “Doc says it’s looking good, so I should be able to.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She smiled, “I don’t care either way, I just want to know if I need to keep my Friday nights open.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky’s ears turned pink. “So you plan to keep me around?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “As long as my dad doesn’t murder you first.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A slow song came on, and he led Morgan outside on the balcony.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, I know this is kind of soon, but I live with a bunch of women, and I’m in tune with my emotions. Um, Morgan? I love you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan’s smile stretched across her face. “Well, my parents are surprisingly hopeless romantics, and I love you too.” She kissed him before hearing her dad clear his throat behind them, causing Nicky to jump.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sir, I am so sorry.” He apologized.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Daddy, he loves me, and I love him,” Morgan said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky looked at Mr. Stark with a look of fear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Unless you’d rather me not, sir. Then I will push it back down, sir.” He swallowed. Even though he was taller than Tony, the man terrified him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony looked him up and down. “Do you love Morgan?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, sir,” Nicky replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I believe you think you know what love is having grown up at Compound de Harkimoff. But you’re still just a kid. If you hurt her, not even Nat can save you, got it?” Tony said, eyes dark.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, sir,” Nicky answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony nodded and turned around, looking for Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked around. It was a few minutes until midnight. Nicky was in love, Alice and Jen were engaged, Wanda was glowing now that she was fully out, Nat finally had her girl, Vision seemed happier, and Agatha was actually getting along with Tony as they both talked to some other actors. Still, Agatha kept glancing over at Rio and smiling, Billy and Eddie were out, and even Tommy had a girlfriend. For all the drama SF was trying to cause, good was coming from it. Rio knew the other shoe would drop, but for right now, things were good. Agatha came over to her and kissed Rio’s cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s almost midnight, and I believe I am supposed to kiss my girlfriend.” Agatha handed Rio a fresh flute of Champagne.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good thing that’s me. I would be very upset if it weren’t.” Rio took the glass and pulled Agatha close to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The countdown began as she stared into Agatha’s ocean-blue eyes. This woman Rio cared so deeply for.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The countdown hit midnight, and they kissed before toasting and then kissed again. She tasted the champagne on Agatha’s mouth and made a silent wish for an amazing year with this woman.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s phone was on a nearby table and went off. Her eyes flew open. That text’s timing could only be from one person.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned and looked at the phone as if it had started speaking, then looked back at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s okay, baby, it’s just scare tactics.” Agatha ran her hand down Rio’s back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio picked up the phone and almost dropped it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was a picture of LAX.

      Thank you so much for all the love you've shown! Kudos, comments, love on socials, etc.
     </p>
<p>
      Realistically, unless I start writing smaller chapters again, there are probably only a few chapters left. However, I want to make this a series and do a follow-up with one-shots of different moments of life. What would y'all like to see? There are some things I want to go back and do different POV's of, further into the future on some things, etc.
     </p>
<p>
      If that's something anyone would be interested in, of course.

      It was New Year’s Day, barely after midnight, as Rio clung to Agatha and stared at her phone. “Do you think she’s actually here? In LA?” Rio wasn’t asking anyone specifically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was able to mask the tracking and finally pinpoint her. According to that, she’s here. As in about to crash the party.” Nat said, head whipping around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We will not be staying for that,” Agatha said firmly. “Nat, divide up security. Stay with the Maximoffs. Jen and Alice are with them. Ri, carry your shoes and come with me.” Agatha took Rio’s hand after they both slipped their shoes off and led her in the opposite direction from the main exit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This was a plan Agatha and Nat had already devised in case SF reared her gorgeous blonde head. Nat would separate the others into two cars and send them home, while Agatha and Rio would slip out the back. While it would look like they got into one of the standard large black SUVs, they would get into an unassuming black Subaru Outback capable of off-roading with Nat as the driver.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, you know I trust you, but where are we going?” Rio asked as she was led away from the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We planned for her,” Agatha said over her shoulder as the power went out. They both stopped. “We did not plan for that.” Thankfully, backup generators roared to life, and the power flickered back on. Agatha quickened their pace to where they were practically running as they burst through the back door. “Okay, go around the SUV and get in the Subaru,” Agatha instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio flung open the passenger door to see Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shotgun.” Wanda waved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nat, Wanda is supposed to be at the compound with everyone else!” Agatha admonished as she and Rio climbed in the back, buckling their seatbelts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You try telling her no.” Nat shot back as she pulled away from the building.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have. Plenty of times.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “To be fair, you’re not in love or sleeping with me.” Wanda turned around in her seat, smiling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<span>
      Oh Cinderella, we didn’t
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      even get to dance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a feral scream, causing Nat to run off the road momentarily before correcting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m tired of this! I hate this! Why can’t she just leave me alone?” Rio had tears in her eyes as Agatha held her hand. “Agatha, being with you has made me so happy, yet I have cried so much. I have caused you so much pain. We had to leave a party early, in a fucking getaway car, because of my ex. Thanksgiving and Christmas were partly ruined. The boys have been put in danger. Who knows what else she’ll do? I can’t lose you, Agatha. I can’t lose any of you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had been looking at Agatha before looking at Wanda, who had turned around in her seat. She inhaled deeply. She had made a decision, and it hurt, as all she wanted to do was go back to Agatha’s and sleep in her arms. “When we return to the compound, I’m going home.” She immediately winked at Agatha and Wanda. She didn’t know if SF could hear them, but she wasn’t taking any chances.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Darcy had upgraded the networks at the compound and all houses, as they hadn’t found a single bug anywhere. Lou was dangerously intelligent for a supermodel, although that had been more of a cover for her cat burglary gig. Modeling was also how she caught Shane's eye all those years ago. She hadn’t necessarily confessed to Rio as much as Rio had found out about it accidentally.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned to Agatha. “When we get to the house, I’ll explain everything.” She whispered in Agatha’s ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, Cinderella, looks like your Princess Charming from Hell is trying to collect on that dance,” Nat said as she looked in the rearview mirror. “Everyone, hold on. This is our exit.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This isn’t an…” Wanda started as Nat made a hard left onto a hidden dirt path, thankful there was no oncoming traffic on this particular backroad.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat didn’t slow the vehicle down as they bounced over the uneven terrain and careened around trees, following what seemed like an invisible path. Rio kept her eyes trained on the headlights behind them before they finally fell out of view. She turned around, slumping in her seat, “Where are we?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned close as a precaution before whispering, “Secret back entrance.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They went through a gated entrance at the back of the compound, passing by the foundation of Alice and Jen’s house, the skeleton of the guest house, and around to the front of Agatha’s. As they exited the vehicle, Rio motioned for them to leave their phones in the car and stay outside for the moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t know if she can hear us through the phones, but I’m now highly paranoid, pumped full of adrenaline, and running on champagne fumes at one forty-five in the morning on New Year's Day. Here’s the plan, in case she can still hear us in the house. We’re going to go in there, and you two,” Rio looked at Wanda and Agatha. “Are going to use those Oscar-winning skills of yours. I will go off about how I need to go home and think about things, and we’ll improvise from there. I will go to my apartment, and she’ll most likely meet me there. Hopefully, I can convince her to leave me alone, or Nat, you do you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not a fan, what if…” Agatha started before Rio put her fingers to Agatha’s lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please. Let me do this. We have to try and end this. If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. I still believe she won’t hurt me.” She removed her hand and kissed Agatha before she could respond.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda and Nat exchanged looks. They weren’t as certain as Rio seemed to be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha swallowed the tears and confessions in her throat. “Alright,” she turned to Wanda, “Let’s go superstar.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh! Wait!” Rio held up a hand before they entered the house. “Raven is staying here. They hate each other, and I do not trust Lou to be nice. Now, everyone, get your phones first.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stormed into the house first, where everyone was gathered. “I can’t do this to everyone anymore, Aggie! I want this so much, but it’s just causing pain!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was on her heels, “Rio! We can work this out. I…” Agatha realized this suddenly felt very real to her, and she almost let it slip. Again. She had to confess, and soon. “Care about you so much. We’ve met her head-on since this started. We can handle this together. We can end the entire thing.” Agatha had given an overly theatrical wink to everyone in the room when they had come in, and Wanda had done a double thumbs up. Agatha hoped everyone knew this was fake. Wasn’t it?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had winced when Agatha had, once again, avoided saying ‘love’. “At least Lou is honest with me about her feelings. Psychotic or not.” She said in a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was a blow to the chest, and Agatha deserved it. Looking at Rio, hurt in her eyes, she said, “Baby, I…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m going home, I need to think some things over,” Rio stated louder as she turned and stormed out the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha dropped onto a couch, Alice scooting over just in time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Was that acting?” Agatha asked, looking at Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not sure,” Wanda answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat had followed Rio outside. “Hey, stop for a second!” She called out as Rio stopped right in front of her car, not turning. Nat stopped behind her, whispering. “She does, you know. She just doesn’t know how to say it. Don’t give up on her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned around slowly, her face blank. “Nat, I just,” she sighed. “I want to tell her, and there’s a woman who IS telling me, and I just…” she trailed off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat put a firm hand on her shoulder. “Look, you have to go in there with a clear head, okay? Also, do you want this?” She offered a small handgun, not wanting to say the words aloud for fear of Lou’s eavesdropping.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. She could shoot, but she didn’t want to. “No, I’m covered.” She said, brandishing a small knife. A rather creepy smile pulled at her lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Scary bitch. Alright, go. We’ll see you soon.” Nat let her go and stepped back as Rio left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was numb on the drive to her building, and facts swirled around her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou was insane and dangerous.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou loved Rio but felt like she owned her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou viewed Rio as an object.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was amazing and wanted a life with Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha refused to find and/or admit her feelings.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was not in love with Lou.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had caused her friends a lot of problems.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was madly in love with Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt her stomach churn.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was conflicted. Rio knew she had these feelings for Agatha, but she hadn’t fully admitted them to anyone else. She should be able to share them, shouldn’t she? She had told Alice she wasn’t ready, but when would she be? What was holding her back? Was she waiting for Lou to disappear? Was she waiting on Agatha? When would she know?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had to keep her head clear and protect the people she loved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was jolted out of her thoughts when her phone dinged, and her GPS showed a new location. Lou must be controlling her phone. Rio would have to tell Nat but couldn’t risk using the compromised cellphone.
     </span>
</p>

<span>
      I have a surprise planned for us.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I can’t wait to see you.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt sick, but she also knew she needed to follow the GPS. She drove as it directed, trusting that Nat would be able to find her, and followed the automated voice to a fancy apartment building in an isolated nice area of town.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat saw the message mirrored on the clone of Rio’s phone as Rio turned in the opposite direction. She would have to follow discreetly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What’s she doing?” Agatha asked from the passenger seat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had been able to convince everyone else to stay at the compound.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “SF hacked Rio’s phone and sent her to a different location,” Nat responded, careful to follow from a distance. The route started to look familiar. “Agatha, are we headed to…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes.” Agatha interrupted. “My condo.” She finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You still own it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yep,” Agatha said with a pop.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Have you listed it?” Nat looked at her briefly before turning back to the road.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No,” she said with a sigh. “This is going to be really bad.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had learned from Swords that it was best to keep a separate place for flings and one-night stands. Her condo was out of the way, discreet, and everything she needed it to be. She had meant to list it and hadn’t yet, knowing she had to confess to Rio first. Then, she would sell it as a final symbol of shedding her past life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat slammed her fist into the steering wheel, startling Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Blyat, Agatha! I threatened Rio so she would open up to you when YOU’RE the idiot here! I have been keeping your extremely dark secrets for decades and making sure none of your poor decisions come back to bite you in the ass. Rio comes into our lives and, in a few months, does things that even you couldn’t do, Agatha. Yet YOU won’t tell her everything. I know there are secrets that Lorna took to the grave with her, but it’s time to confess all of those to Rio and finally tell her that you love her. She’s not going to wait for you forever, Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat’s face matched her hair, and Agatha understood where her anger and frustration were coming from.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re right,” Agatha whispered, staring straight ahead as they reached the building.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know I am. Now, before we bust in there, we’ll listen to the conversation to see when we need to save the day.” Nat had produced a laptop, and her fingers were flying across the keyboard.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There’s a mic in the necklace that I can tap into,” Nat said as she brought up the audio. “Don’t worry, it’s ONLY for emergencies,” Nat added, seeing the look of concern on Agatha’s face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took a deep breath as she reached the building she had been directed to, trusting that Nat and Agatha weren’t far behind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>

      Look at the row of
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      mailboxes. You’ll be
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      able to find it from there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio walked into the building. The doorman looked at her slightly confused before he nodded and greeted her by name. She walked the row of mailboxes and saw A.H. on the last one.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A.H.? Agatha Harkness? Why did Agatha have a condo here?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She took the elevator to the penthouse and stepped out before walking to the unit. 821. The numbers seemed familiar to Rio before it clicked, Lorna’s birthday, backward. January twenty-eighth. Rio approached the door and looked at the keypad on the door. If this really was Agatha’s place, then she knew the code would be the day the order to be free of her mother was granted. She prayed it wouldn’t work as she typed in the numbers. The light flashed green, and the lock clicked as she turned the knob and pushed the door open.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was still wearing the dress from the party, and she suddenly became painfully aware of how revealing it was as the door closed and locked behind her. Lou was standing in front of her, wearing jeans and a black cable knit sweater. Lou looked flawless as her eyes wandered possessively over Rio’s body.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve missed you, my pet,” Lou said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I hate you,” Rio walked into the room, past Lou, and perched on the arm of a couch. The apartment didn’t have many personal effects, but it oozed Agatha’s personality.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What is this place, Lou?” Rio asked with a sigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A smile crept across Lou’s face as she stalked towards Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha’s fuck pad, pet. She didn’t take women home with her. She brought them here. Funny, she still has it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked away, not wanting to give Lou the satisfaction of seeing the hurt on her face. It felt like someone had stabbed her in the heart and twisted. No wonder Agatha hadn’t told her she loved her. She couldn’t let go of the past. “Okay, so it hasn’t sold yet.” She said quietly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s not even on the market.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Another blow. Rio stood, moving further from Lou.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Like you were always truthful, Lou? I almost died because you weren’t.” Rio was trying to keep her voice flat and void of all emotion, but the emotions were seeping in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I realize my actions caused you harm, and I would never hurt you, Rio. I am so sorry, and as for all of this,” She gestured around, “I had to get your attention, baby.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou was right behind Rio as she wrapped her arms around Rio’s waist.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stiffened. “You don’t get to touch me like this anymore, Lou.” She said hotly, flinging Lou’s arms away, stepping out of the embrace, and turning around. “Is this your master plan, Lou? Come in here, show me Agatha has a secret apartment, and hope I break up with her? This is a conversation, Lou. Not a reason to break up with her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was more annoyed at this point.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Honestly, I thought she’d be here with you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou had closed in on her again, and Rio felt like she was being chased around the apartment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So you’re stalling until she shows up? God, Lou. You have lost it. We are not getting back together. You hurt our kids, Lou.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio spat, looking right at Lou, who was only inches away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou looked hurt at that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Baby, I would never hurt our kids. They’re safe with Shane.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was shocked. Did Lou really think she was talking about Lou’s kids?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, Lou. Nicky. Billy. Tommy. Hell, even Morgan. You…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was cut off as Lou slapped her, open-handed across the face, before shoving her against the wall, hand wrapping around Rio’s throat with the slightest amount of pressure. Rio brought her hands up and wrapped them around Lou’s wrist, trying to push it away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou raised an eyebrow. “You used to love it when I choked you. Begged me to choke you harder.” She purred.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio scoffed, “That was before you completely ignored the safe word and blew past all my boundaries. You know who doesn’t do that? Agatha. You know who takes care of me in bed? Agatha. In bed and everywhere else. It will always be Agatha. Not you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou’s grip tightened despite Rio’s best efforts to loosen it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The door flew open as Nat and Agatha ran in. Lou quickly removed her hand and looked at the newly arrived women as Rio fell to her knees, gulping in lungfuls of air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, it’s about fucking time!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou watched as Agatha ran to Rio and knelt beside her. Agatha had tears building from seeing and hearing where Rio had been hurt and from the anger toward Lou rising in her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, are you okay?” Agatha asked as she lightly touched Rio’s reddened cheek where Lou had slapped her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Agatha, hurt and pain in her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, I’m not. We have to talk.” Rio’s voice was raspy as Agatha helped her stand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat hadn’t drawn her weapon, but she had positioned herself where Lou would have to go through her first to get back to Rio or Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Leave her alone, Lou, she doesn’t want you,” Nat said harshly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This isn’t your fight, you feisty chihuahua.” Lou looked back at Agatha. “Ah, and the bitch that stole what’s mine.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She doesn’t
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       belong
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      to anyone.” Agatha took a step forward, her arm protectively in front of Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I gave her everything!” Lou screamed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou’s face was screwed up in fury as she stepped towards Agatha only stopping when she
     </span>
<span>
      saw Nat take a step forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio lowered Agatha’s arm aside, moving towards Lou.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You gave me NOTHING. You took and took everything from me. You stripped away my sense of safety, my sense of security, my love, my freedom, my self-respect, my dignity, my sanity, my ability to TRUST.” Her voice went from acidic to soft as she turned to Agatha. “Agatha gave that BACK to me, Lou.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A sardonic smile cut across Lou’s face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please. She can’t even tell you she loves you. Do you think THIS was the only secret she was keeping from you? Ha. She’s the queen of deception, pet.” Lou looked at Agatha. “Are you going to tell her, or should I?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha narrowed her eyes at her. “You don’t know anything.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you think Rio’s phone was the only one I hacked? I heard an interesting conversation between the unholy trinity here, my sweet. Looks like Superstar and Jane Bond only know half-truths about your global sweetheart here, too.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou’s arms were crossed in front of her chest, and her smile was a Cheshire cat-like grin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nat, end her,” Agatha instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head, moving forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, Nat, is this true?” Rio asked, her eyes filled with uncertainty and pain.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha responded, flustered, “There was never a right time to bring it up.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m so sorry, Rio,” Nat said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nat, it wasn’t yours or Wanda’s place to tell me. Agatha? How many times do we have to go through this? YOU were the one begging me to open up, and you only fed me enough, so I wouldn’t ask more questions? Is there more to why you don’t do relationships? Tell me now. No more excuses..” Rio’s voice betrayed her hurt, rage, and unfinished ultimatum.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sensing the opening, Lou jumped in. “She doesn’t love you the way I do, baby. Just look at her phone. Go to November first.” Lou instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha handed her phone to Rio, scouring her memory of that night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s the night I went out to the club, Wanda brought my drunk ass to your house. I have nothing to hide, Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took the phone and tapped in the code.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “At least she has been forthright. I trust the blonde sociopath over there more than you right now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She pulled up the photo app and went to November 1st. There were pictures from the football game and pictures from the club, and then, Rio’s hand flew to her mouth as she let out a gasp. Nat rushed to look over Rio’s shoulder, shock on her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What? What is it?” Agatha asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh? You don’t remember?” Rio spat each word dripping acid. Lou began to laugh maniacally.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was extremely drunk,” Agatha tried to explain as Rio thrust the phone into Agatha’s hands. Agatha looked at the picture. There she was, passionately kissing Lou, one hand in the blonde’s hair, the other gripping her shoulder tightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou interrupted in the most rational voice she could muster.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She doesn’t tell you she loves you. She gets drunk and makes out with someone less than twenty-four hours after kissing you, and then a few hours later, what does she tell you? Oh, right, that you’re the only one she’s wanted since she first saw you. Now, I admit I’ve fucked up, but baby, not only has therapy helped me. But if I could turn back time to take back all the things that hurt you, I would, baby. I love you so much. I wouldn’t hide a ten-year-long secret relationship from you. Oh, shit. Guess the cat’s out of the bag now.” Lou put her hand over her mouth like she had accidentally let it slip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just flinched, and Nat looked at Agatha with her eyes wide.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “WHAT! Is THAT why you don’t date?! Because of some brutal relationship you had? That’s an important thing to tell me!” She exploded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat turned back to Lou. She was going to make this bitch disappear. “Where did she go?” She asked out loud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      In all the commotion, Lou had escaped. The door was slightly open, so Nat ran out to see if she could chase her down, closing it behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Agatha, flames in her eyes, “You begged me to be honest and upfront and tell you everything, and I did. But, you kept lying to me!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t lie. I just didn’t tell you the complete truth,” Agatha lied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s even worse!” Rio yelled. “You were in a relationship for TEN years, Agatha. TEN YEARS. You didn’t think that was something I needed to know? You told me you wanted me, that I was IT, and yet you KEPT YOUR SECRET APARTMENT. The place you only used to fuck other women. But, most importantly, you didn’t tell me about it. You didn’t think THAT would piss me off?!” Rio was pacing in front of Agatha, hands flying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You seemed pretty calm about that a moment…” Agatha started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because I wasn’t going to say anything in front of my sociopathic stalker of an ex, dumbass! So  for the record, I am NOT CALM ABOUT IT.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stopped and looked straight at Agatha. Rio ran her hands through her hair, she couldn’t stay here right now, she didn’t want to hear Agatha’s excuses or explanations, but she also knew they weren’t over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “God, Agatha, to think, I was ready to tell you…it doesn’t matter. I can’t look at you right now. I’m going to my place, I’ll get Raven later. Just know that we are NOT broken up, and  this conversation is nowhere near over We have the Globes this weekend, so this is not a pass to go fuck someone or make out with my ex, since I have to be clear about that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio saw Agatha wince as the verbal blow hit, and she didn’t care how vicious her words were.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have thinking to do, and you have confessions to make. Get your shit together, Harkness.” With that, Rio stormed out, refusing to look back at Agatha. Rio hadn’t even let her talk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sank onto a couch, buried her face into her hands, and cried.
     </span>

      Rio had gotten home around five in the morning. She needed Nat to remove the malware on her phone but didn’t care right now. Let Lou listen in on things, what did it matter now? She had stripped off her dress, sobbed in the shower, put on pajamas, and then sobbed in her bed. She had spent most of the break in Agatha’s arms every single night. She didn’t even have her cat. She sighed as she grabbed her phone.

      Nat told us everything.

<span>
      I even have ice cream.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had sad, heartbreak songs playing when she heard the door open and the distinct sound of the bell on Raven’s collar.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m going to feed her first and put the ice cream in the freezer,” Alice called out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio didn’t respond, just lay there, waiting for her found sister, when the bed moved, and Alice curled up behind her. They would cuddle and talk for hours growing up and then during breakups or any disappointment they experienced through the years. They had found comfort in each other for the past twenty-three years of their lives, and Rio was thankful they were in the same city again. Rio rolled over and buried her head in Alice’s shoulder, sobbing again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, Ri. I’m proud of you for telling Agatha you had to talk first and not break up. That’s great!” Alice praised her friend. It was a big step. Usually, Rio ran instead of facing things head-on. She wasn’t proud of everything Rio had said, but she was focusing on the good right now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why didn’t she tell me?” Rio sniffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think it caused some serious damage and trauma for her, according to Nat and Wanda. And they don’t even know the whole story or who the woman is. It happened eighteen years ago, and she hasn’t had a relationship since.” Alice provided.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She still needs to tell me everything,” Rio stated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She does. Wanda says there’s probably a lot more.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled onto her back, “I don’t know what to do. Lou apologized, you know?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Right before trying to kill you.” Alice reminded her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Foreplay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You cannot go back to her, Rio.” Alice gripped Rio’s hand, trying to convey the seriousness of the situation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I wonder if that’s the only way everyone will be safe,” Rio responded, sounding hopeless.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nat finally decided to use all means necessary to end it,” Alice whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes went wide. She knew what that meant and wasn’t exactly sure how she felt about it. “Oh,” was all she could utter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s the only real way to keep us safe, and you know it,” Alice assured her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know it is.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      What surprised Rio was how empty she felt on the inside. She had loved that psychotic woman, and now they were talking about her demise, and she felt nothing but relief.

      Agatha felt absolutely awful. She hadn’t been honest and now everything had blown up in her face. Nat was working on Agatha’s phone and double-checking that all of Lou’s malware had been removed while Wanda sat on the opposite end of the couch from Agatha, glaring at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I can’t believe you,” Wanda said for what had to be the hundredth time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’ve already established that.” Agatha’s voice was hoarse from crying since she left the penthouse. Jen was already working on getting it listed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I just, I can’t believe you hadn’t listed that place! God, Agatha! What were you thinking? We know that bitch has been listening in to conversations and will do anything to break the two of you up. You’re going to lose her, Agatha, and it will be your fault.” Wanda said harshly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew Wanda was serious, and she had started to cry again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s the best thing to happen to you since Nicky.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m well aware.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you, Agatha? Or are you taking her for granted? This is your true second chance, and you might not get a third. Not everyone wants to take a chance on your playboy ass, or if they did, they would be after your money or other ulterior motives.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s words were like a punch to the gut. Had she been aware of how lucky she had been? Wanda was right. It was hard dating when you were Agatha Fucking Harkness. That’s what Swords had taught her, wasn’t it? Rio never cared about Agatha’s fame or her money. Half the time, Rio insisted on paying and got annoyed when Agatha beat her to it. The job was just now starting to bother Rio, and only because Agatha was about to be away for longer. Rio wasn’t interested in fame for herself or getting her foot in the door. Agatha looked at Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I should have listened to you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You fucking think?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat handed Agatha her phone back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s fixed and secure. Don’t text Rio until I tell you it’s okay. I’m going over there now. Don’t make me keep secrets from her again.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked at Agatha as if it were more of a threat than a warning before leaving.

      Rio was eating her Half Baked ice cream straight from the container at ten on the morning of New Year’s, and she didn’t care who judged her for it. Her relationship was rocky, and her ex was still out there somewhere, most likely listening to everything she said. She and Alice sat on Rio’s bed, Raven trying to steal bites of ice cream from both of them. Alice was the friend she needed to be, but she was tired and had barely slept since she woke up the day before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Maybe I should just make a playlist and send it to her…” Rio was saying when Alice received a text from Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, Nat’s coming over to clear your phone. Then, you need to try to go to sleep.” She looked at Rio and saw how exhausted she truly was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t know if I can.” Rio sounded two inches tall.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You can’t talk to Agatha like this. I’ll make Gran’s tea. That always knocked you out.” Alice said decisively as she stood, “Speaking of, do you…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “In the safe,” Rio finished for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice smiled, glad Rio could read her mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thanks, I knew you’d keep Gran’s set.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She walked into the closet before looking down to where the safe was hidden, seeing where the clothes had been tossed aside and the door to the safe hanging open.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, the safe…” Alice’s voice trailing off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio placed the empty ice cream container on the end table, Raven practically pounced on it.  Rio scrambled off the bed to join Alice in the closet. She stood next to Alice, phone in the pocket of her pajama pants.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She usually doesn’t leave a safe ajar,” Rio said sarcastically as she knelt to open it and looked inside. She knew all of Lou’s tricks and knew Lou would never figure out the code. “Everything’s here,” she said, handing Alice the rings and taking out the manilla folder that held Lorna’s papers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio fished her phone from her pocket and muttered, “3, 2, 1…” and pressed the text as soon as it popped up.

      Or else she would have told you
     </span>

      she loved you.

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio opened her mouth to reply but couldn’t find the words. She and Alice turned as they heard Nat come in the front door. They took the contents from the safe and emerged from the closet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’re in here,” Alice raised her voice loud enough for the other woman to hear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat entered the room, and her eyes immediately fell on the envelope Rio was clenching. Nat took Rio’s phone and gestured with her head so they would follow her to the living room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice grabbed the ice cream trash, which was licked clean by a certain tortoiseshell feline and spoons, and they followed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat started to work her magic, and once the diagnostics were working and she was positive Lou could no longer hear them, she began talking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What is that?” She gestured towards the envelope.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lou was here,” Rio said blankly. “She made copies of whatever is in here, apparently information Lorna had on Agatha.” She looked up at Nat, eyes questioning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t know the answers. If Agatha trusted anyone with absolutely everything, it was Lorna,” Nat answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice’s eyes were wide. “Lorna Wu? My mother? More than Wanda?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda was still young, finding her way. She had a lot going on, meaning me. Agatha wasn’t going to burden her with anything extremely heavy. Lorna had her demons, but she loved and protected fiercely. Just like you do, Alice.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat had a metal water bottle and took a drink from it. “I wish you two had gotten to know her like we did,” Nat gave them a half smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just getting to hear people talk about her the way you guys do is enough,” Alice said, her eyes glistening.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat handed Rio her phone back once it had finished. “Get some sleep and then text her, please. Wanda’s trying to get her to sleep as well. Everyone needs some damn sleep.” Nat yawned. “It won’t help to change the locks, will it?” Nat asked, knowing the answer as Rio shook her head. Lou would get past whatever they attempted. “Then I’m going bitch hunting,” Nat added with a dark smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They watched as she left before Alice turned back to Rio. “Right, so, Gran’s tea.” Alice looked at the thick envelope. “What are we going to do with that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio held it up and examined it. “Nothing yet. I’ll give Agatha a chance, and if I feel like I need to read it, okay. I may just give it to Agatha, honestly.” After all, it seemed like the information was all Agatha’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Alice still didn’t know what secrets Lorna would have had about Agatha that Lou would find interesting.

      Agatha had napped on the couch, waiting for Nat to text her, telling her she could text or call Rio. She checked the time on her watch, eight p.m. “Ugh,” she groaned, knowing her sleep schedule would be off. There was also a text from Nat saying she could text Rio now. She felt slightly less tired but still like the terrible girlfriend she had been. All she wanted to do was hold Rio, run her fingers through her hair, apologize, and tell her everything. Well, almost everything. Some things may still be better off unsaid. She rolled onto her back and stared at the high ceiling of the living room.

<span>
       “Why don’t you ever tell the whole truth?” A 21-year-old Agatha asked Swords with naive curiosity. Swords was still rejecting her, but they had run into each other at the New York club that Agatha secretly owned and were speaking as friends.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Why don’t you want anyone to know you own this place?” Swords countered.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I don’t want people to try and get in my good graces just for free drinks or to expect me always to be here. Or to think I’m trying to curate my own pool of women, as it were.” Agatha explained.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Right. You want to uphold a certain image, and so do I.” Answered Swords. “ There are certain things I want to keep quiet about myself. I don’t mind that people know I have a life outside of my career or hold secrets by NDA, but being with some of the biggest names in Hollywood? I can’t have that. I can’t be accused of the things I would be accused of, kid.” Swords replied, flipping her hair back.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Do you ever want kids…?” The question was out of her mouth before Agatha even thought about it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Swords chuckled. “With my job? Probably not. I’m already getting past that age, and you know how hard it is to have a successful career and kids. Look at Lorna.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha nodded and looked down, trying to school her expression. Alice was five, and Lorna barely saw her. She said she was better off with Norma and away from this life where she would spend all of her time with nannies.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “It’s better to create the image you want people to see, Aggie. Keep a few people close and most distant. The world loves you and accepts your bad girl ways. Play into it. It makes you unique. Keep the new kid, the redhead, close. She’s interesting and your opposite. You want that balance. Be her Lorna. Keep Lorna close to you, too. Now, we’ve been seen together for far too long, and there is a very cute girl over there with pink hair that has been trying to get your eye.” Swords said as she left.
      </span>

</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Swords had taught Agatha a lot over the years—the influence upon her life beyond quantifiable. Even if Swords had destroyed her, she had done some good things. However, the wound she intentionally or unintentionally inflicted left a scar so sensitive, that Agatha was still so hesitant to let herself love again.
     </span>
</p>

<span>
       Agatha was 27, and she and Swords were having a pleasant night in. They had had an actual date. Pizza, movies, and Swords was trying to develop Agatha’s taste for wine. Agatha preferred harder liquor and fruity things. However, Swords was trying to make her more sophisticated.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You’re on Broadway, kid. You spend time with people like Meryl Streep and Cher. You need to drink more than Malibu, Grey Goose, and…are these Smirnoffs?” Swords said, looking through Agatha’s fridge.  It was summer, and they were in New York again.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “So? I’ve been on Broadway before, I won a Tony as a teenager, in case you’ve forgotten and Cher is more your friend. Lorna, Wanda, Drew, Madonna, none of them have problems with what I drink.” Agatha reached for a green Smirnoff, only for Swords to swat at her hand.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “None of them have an EGOT with another Broadway show forthcoming.” Swords was pouring a glass of wine. “A lady knows her wines.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I have never been accused of being a lady,” Agatha responded wryly.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You certainly don’t fuck like one,” Swords laughed.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha leaned against the counter, crossing her legs at the ankles. “You don’t have to get me drunk for that if that’s what you’re trying to do.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Swords handed the wine glasses to Agatha as she grabbed the bottle and led Agatha to the living room of Agatha’s Manhattan apartment.

<span>
       “Oh, I know I don’t.”

       They sat, Agatha, tucking her legs under her. “...do you love me?”

       Swords stilled as she turned towards Agatha.
      </span>

<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Of course I do,” she replied, eyebrows knitting together.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “No, I mean, are you in love with me?” Agatha took a deep breath. It’s just, that I am so deeply in love with you. You won’t let me tell anyone we’re seeing each other, while I want to scream it from the rooftops. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and you laugh it off, insisting we see other people.” Agatha’s eyes were about to betray her as she tried to hold her tears back.
      </span>

</p>
<p>

<span>
       “Lorna knows,” was the only reply she was awarded: serious, curt, angry.
      </span>

</p>
<p>
<em>

       Agatha gave a small cry of frustration.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Of course she does! I can’t help that she figured it out! Stop ignoring the question!”
      </span>

       Swords was surprised by Agatha’s tone.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Yes, I love you, Agatha, but those things are impossible. I don’t want any of that, and you know it. I will not explain it to you again. Now, don’t go ruining a good night before it’s even begun.” Swords reached for Agatha’s cheek as Agatha retreated backward.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Leave,” Agatha said abruptly.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “What?” Swords was shocked. Agatha had never kicked her out before.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You heard me, leave.” She said, standing up and walking to her bedroom.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She heard Swords leave and sobbed, calling Lorna, who was so proud of her for standing up for herself.
      </span>

       Agatha begged Swords to forgive her four days later.

      “No wonder I’m like this,” Agatha said out loud to no one as she picked up her phone. Swords had told her repeatedly never to grovel or beg, and finally, she had stopped. Stopped going back to her. She raised her phone again and typed out multiple messages before finally landing on one.

      Okay, so Agatha probably should have told her in person, but she needed to get that off her chest. She stared at her phone, waiting for the response.

<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>

      Rio read Agatha’s text. She knew Jen had listed the condo, and Alice had told her as much. She didn’t care about that, not really. She was mad that it had been a secret. Of course, she wanted to talk to Agatha, but where? If they talked at Rio’s, then she could kick Agatha out if she needed to. If they went to Agatha’s, Rio could very dramatically walk out. Either way, she wanted to see Agatha.

     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was panicking. Did she want Rio to come over? Should they eat? Should she order something? Nicky was up at the clubhouse with the twins. She should order dinner and have Rio over, is what she should do, she finally decided.

      Rio was biting her thumbnail, thinking. She was hungry, but part of her wanted to make Agatha wait. The problem with that was she would have to wait, too. She sighed as she typed back and got out of the bed she had been sleeping in to change into sweats without holes in them.

      Rio was facing Agatha on their usual ends of the couch, pizza devoured, water cups on the coffee table, and Rio had music playing as she stared at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Time to come clean. I’m only going to ask you this one more time. Why don’t you date, Agatha?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took a deep breath in through her nose and let it out through her mouth before beginning. “It’s not pretty,” She started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It doesn’t have to be,” Rio could handle it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A long time ago, I loved someone, and she destroyed me. I was young, twenty-three, and I had chased her for years. I call her Swords.” Agatha started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Something clicked in Rio’s brain, “Your tattoo…it’s for her. She’s your heartbreak. You’ve lied to me since the first time we had sex.” Rio’s voice was hollow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took Rio’s hand and tipped her chin to look into Rio’s big brown eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, look at me. That was not the time to bring that up, okay? Was I supposed to say, ‘yeah, that’s for the ex I never told you about’ right after the best sex I’ve ever had?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s voice was sincere and Rio could tell that she was, in fact, being truthful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sorry, best? Agatha, that’s hyperbolic.” Rio’s voice was skeptical.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s not just sex with you, Rio. That’s why. It’s more than that, and it is for you, too, so don’t play it off. Now, may I continue, or are you going to keep giving me that disbelieving look?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re right. It is more than that.” Rio pushed her hair behind her ears and tried to put a more neutral expression on her face. “Okay, continue. You were twenty-three and in love with Swords.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes. She was much older, and no, I’m not telling you who she was.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had raised an eyebrow in question, and Agatha reached over and poked it, eliciting a small smile from the younger woman.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We dated for roughly a decade on and off before I finally decided I had had enough, and I couldn’t take the pain anymore. I believe she loved the idea of me, but she wasn’t a marriage and family type of woman. I wanted it all, and she didn’t want anyone to know we were together. We weren’t monogamous; she never wanted to be, which was fine at first. She told me to keep up my reputation, and I did. She was the kind of woman that dealt in secrets and information, hidden identities, falsehoods, and half-truths,” Agatha let out an empty laugh. “She taught me everything I know. She’s the one who told me to keep a hidden condo and curate my image and what I let people see. She tried to talk me out of children for the longest time when I finally decided I wanted a child more than I wanted her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s voice was full of sadness, but she didn’t cry. It felt good to get it off her chest, to confide in Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She worked with a lot of celebrities in different capacities and didn’t want being associated with me to screw it up. Imagine being associated with me being viewed as a bad thing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda and Nat didn’t even know I was dating at the time. Not until it was over, and they still don’t know who she is to this day. Lorna was the only one who knew, and only because she knew Swords, too. I told Lorna everything back then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Anyway, I was madly in love with her, but she didn’t love me the same way, and every single time she broke my heart, I would just crawl back to her, and every single time she would act as if she were teaching me some valuable lesson.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked off to the side as though she saw the memories pass by.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “After I finally walked away, I told myself I would never let myself experience that heartbreak again. I threw all my love into my family, career, and other projects.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then you came along, and for the first time in eighteen years, I felt something more than mere lust or desire.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha cradled Rio’s cheek and wiped away a tear that had escaped one of her beautiful brown eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It terrifies me to feel this again, Rio. But, I know you wouldn’t hurt me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was processing everything Agatha had just told her and felt tears on her cheeks for the young Agatha. Rio’s story wasn’t great, but ten years of a dead-end relationship with someone who was never completely yours because they didn’t want to be? What was it with the women around here having tragic love lives?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, why didn’t you just tell me all of this in the first place?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio searched Agatha’s eyes for something that told her she was being dishonest, and all she saw was pain and regret.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Our original conversation had come to a natural end, and I didn’t know how to restart it. I was scared. I was so afraid it would be too much. I haven’t allowed myself to have any romantic feelings until you, and look at how much I’ve fucked it up.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let out a sob as she dropped her forehead against Rio’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am so sorry, baby. Then, the apartment, I should have told you. Part of me was waiting to make this big declaration and listing it as this big symbol of shedding the last part of my old life when I should have done it from the start.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wiped Agatha’s tears as she lightly kissed her cheeks where the tears had been.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh Agatha, I’m not surprised you had an apartment. It was the fact you hadn’t listed it yet, or even told me about it. We’ve barely been together for a month. I’m not stupid. You’ve just sounded so sure of everything, so set on this, on us. Then you throw out things like you’re not the marrying type.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You refuse to call this what it is. It’s confusing. I know we’re still at the beginning of this, though it feels like I’ve known you my whole life, and everything comes so easy with you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat back, immediately missing the contact. Agatha blew out a breath and looked down at her hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Again, this terrifies me. You have seen me in some of my most emotional states, Rio. Yes, I begged you to let me in and bare your soul to me, and you did. This is me laying it all out to you,”
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       most of it,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha thought, a small pang of guilt slicing through her heart. She still felt like she had to protect Swords. There were even darker secrets to be told, and she was still trying to control the narrative of her image. Some secrets were between her, Swords, and Lorna. “I just don’t know if I can say those words yet, and I am so furious at myself for that because I want to, and yet, I can’t.” Agatha started crying again. Rio put her hands on Agatha’s knees.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha? Do you believe in soulmates?” She asked, echoes of young Agatha’s voice echoing in her ears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I thought I did once,” Agatha said timidly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m beginning to think I do, and Agatha, with how quickly we’ve come together, how quickly I’ve fallen for you, and how natural everything seems? I don’t think there’s any other explanation, but it shouldn’t be this hard to admit it.” Rio was going back and forth. Should she tell Agatha, and just not expect anything back? Should she leave? There was no script for this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You were so worried that you were broken, and you are not, Rio. People did things to you, yes, but that’s not you. You were not broken. Being with you is as easy as breathing, Rio. I am damaged. I am the one that has to learn how to do all these things normally. You had every right to be afraid, and you went for it. I completely understand if you need to walk away, if you need us to take a break for a while…” Agatha’s tears flowed freely now, and there was no use trying to get them to stop. She knew her eyes were red and puffy, and she couldn’t imagine what would happen if the deepest, darkest secrets ever came out. Swords was a completely different person now, and she didn’t want to cause her pain or potential pain to Alice if she knew that her own mother had known.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had been looking down as she played with the hem of her sweats, and her head snapped up. “A break? Excuse me? You’re about to go to Canada, and you want to take a break?” Her voice was bordering on hysterical.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s hands had been in her lap, and she quickly took Rio’s hands. “Baby, no, I was saying if you wanted a break because I can’t tell you how much…” Her voice trailed off, not able to say the words. Something deep within her told her she couldn’t without telling her everything, and how was she supposed to do that?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave her a defeated nod as she stood. “I don’t want a break, and I’m not walking away. However, I am exhausted, and we both need sleep.” She stood there for several minutes, looking between the stairs, in the direction of the front door, and at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha watched as Rio struggled to make her decision before Rio finally sighed and grabbed Agatha’s hand, hauling her to her feet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve developed a bad habit; we’re going to bed,” Rio said, her voice shaking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Minutes later, Rio was drifting off to sleep in Agatha’s arms. She wasn’t as peaceful as usual, but she was where she wanted to be. She knew Agatha well enough by now to know that Agatha hadn’t been completely honest with her and was still holding back. Agatha’s breathing had evened out, and upon checking, Rio deemed that she was asleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love you, Agatha,” she whispered before falling into a fitful sleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hadn’t been completely asleep when Rio’s whispered words filled the dark bedroom. Her heart stuttered, and she wished she could return the sentiment and show Rio how much she loved her. Instead, coward that she was, Agatha continued to feign sleep.

      Lou had heard the whole conversation. She couldn’t listen into their phones anymore, but she was still tapped into the houses through the pet cameras and mic. She looked down at the copies of the documents she had taken pictures of. The marriage certificate that had never been filed or signed, with the other name blacked out. The ultrasound pictures dated 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks, and 11 weeks, with Harkness, Agatha in the top corner. Lou had guessed what had happened after that, seeing as how they were from two years before Nicky was born. She had also taken pictures of pages from Lorna’s journal, although even she had used the nickname for Agatha’s ex. It was all spelled out there in print. She just had to convince Rio to look at the envelope of evidence and prove to Rio that Agatha was still refusing to tell her the whole truth.

<span>
      Agatha was still awake with Rio asleep in her arms when Nat’s text came through around one, letting Agatha know that Lou had whatever secrets Lorna had and may have kept. Agatha turned her head toward Rio with a tortured look. Rio mumbled in her sleep, and Agatha only caught every few words. Lyrics to Taylor Swift songs, something about ‘just tell me’ and ‘fucking Lou’. Agatha ran her fingers through Rio’s hair and thought about the past few months. The day she met Rio, or well, met grown-up adult Rio. She had been stopped in her tracks by Rio’s warm mahogany eyes while surrounded by the smell of Axe. It would absolutely be a story one day. Rio was right in how easy and natural everything was between them. Agatha would never have crawled into bed with someone just to cuddle. The great Agatha Harkness had been brought to her knees by this woman in less than a month and had tried to ignore it until she couldn’t any longer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, the scrapbook Rio had made her, the pictures, the things Rio had remembered to write, the lyrics. Rio often spoke in lyrics, movie and TV quotes, and pop culture references. She had put all of that into the scrapbook and enlisted Wanda’s help with pictures, pulling them from every available source. The woman was as cunning as Agatha was, and Rio had left blank spaces around the picture of Agatha; she assumed she would fill in the future. However, there were blank spaces around a few other pictures.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was then that the light bulb went off. Rio had seen every single one of Agatha’s movies, including the most recent one. Death’s Beloved and a few of the mystery and action ones had included black light ink. Agatha carefully removed herself from beneath Rio, kissing her lightly on the forehead as she left the bed, grabbed the scrapbook off her nightstand, and went to Nicky’s room. She knew he had a blacklight pen left over from a spy-themed birthday party from a few years ago. She found it and took the two items downstairs. She settled on the couch cross-legged, opened the scrapbook in her lap, and turned on the blacklight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The picture Wanda had taken of them at the back-to-school party. They were sitting on the beach, talking animatedly with the sunset in front of them. She scanned the page as hidden lyrics popped out, separated on the page. ‘Met you at the right time’; ‘Livin’ in a movie I’ve watched,’; ‘Funny, ‘cause you couldn’t have called it’.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She flipped through pages, a movie night where Wanda had taken a picture of them cuddled on the couch, Rio’s head in Agatha’s lap, Agatha playing with Rio’s hair and talking to Jen or Alice off camera. In blacklight ink, lyrics from ‘Enchanted’, a recurring song throughout so far, ‘two a.m. who do you love?’, ‘please don’t be in love with someone else’. That picture had been taken in early October, it seemed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pictures from New York, a paparazzi shot of all things, but a damn good one. Above this one, ‘We fell in love in October, that’s why I love fall.’ Agatha waited for her heart to stop, for some wild reaction, raised anxiety, and nothing. She was calm as a warmth washed over her, and she smiled. Agatha had started falling for Rio before October, but that was a definite turning point.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A picture from their first date, ‘All my life, I’ve been looking for this’. Another date, ‘For me, it’s always you’. Thanksgiving and the social media posts, ‘Is it alright to feel this way so early?’, ‘You’re the risk I’m gonna take it’. A picture from the winter dance, ‘Too soon to tell you I love you’. Rio and Agatha on the couch in Nicky’s hospital room. Wanda had taken it because she thought it was sweet. Agatha had succumbed to emotional exhaustion, and Rio was holding her as if she was trying to protect her from everything going on in the world, “I want you for worse or for better.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The hidden messages combined with what had already been written only amplified the meaning of the gift that Agatha held. She did her best not to get any tears on the scrapbook and was thankful for the page protectors. She knew this had been made with care and love, but it was so much more. It was the words Rio had said to her just a few hours before. Then the picture of Agatha. She took a deep breath as the blacklight landed on the page, and it lit up like Coachella in the middle of the desert.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘I wanna teach you how forever feels,’; ‘You could absolutely break my heart, that’s how I know we’re in love,’; ‘I’m gonna give you my heart’; ‘I want the secrets your secrets haven’t found,’;
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘What if I let it slip? (Tell you that oh, my God, I fucking love you)’.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      At the bottom, there was an arrow telling her to turn the page, and on the back was a letter from Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As I am writing this, it has been roughly five months since we met at the fieldhouse at SHIELD. We have been through so much in that time. Our friends will say we put them through a slow-burn romance, though compared to those four, we sped through this. I know it’s a stereotype that sapphics move rather quickly, but I think we just go with what feels right, and this does.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I grew up watching you and idolizing you. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would ever be friends with you, let alone one of your inner circle. Then, we fell for each other; you kissed me, you took me on dates, Agatha Fucking Harkness swept me off my feet, and fuck it, I fell in love with you and am finally admitting it to myself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I hope when you find this, we’ve either finally admitted it or you’ve at least figured out how you feel. I feel like we’ve lived a movie of our own, full of drama, and we deserve a happy ending.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Please be my happily ever after.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Love, Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s hands were shaking as she closed the scrapbook, turned off the pen, and placed them both on the coffee table before her. She wasn’t shaking from Rio’s confession, but because she knew without a shadow of a doubt that she was ready to tell Rio what she hadn’t told her earlier. Fuck Swords, she could protect herself, and Rio would never find out who she was anyway.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I see you figured out the secret?” Rio’s voice came from behind the couch, starting Agatha. She hadn’t even heard her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hummed as Rio sat next to Agatha, curling her legs underneath her arm on the back of the couch. Agatha turned to face her, mirroring their positions from earlier in the night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I did, and I love everything in it. Everything.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She made sure to hold Rio’s gaze as she said it. Agatha cupped the back of Rio’s neck with one hand and her cheek with the other as she pressed her lips to Rio’s. Agatha’s thumb caressed gentle circles along Rio’s jaw as she kissed Rio tenderly. As Rio attempted to deepen the kiss, Agatha reluctantly pulled back. Rio made a whining sound at the sudden loss as she watched Agatha sit back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, there are some things I need to tell you before we go any further,” Agatha was finally ready to share some of her deepest and darkest secrets that only two other people knew, and one of them was no longer alive.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded and sighed. “I suspected there was more,” Rio said bitterly, looking away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m going to explain that too, okay?” Agatha looked at Rio as if seeking her permission and approval to continue.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked back at Agatha, “Okay, Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She could see the resignation written on Agatha’s face and could tell that Agatha truly was ready to get everything out in the open. Agatha took Rio’s hands in hers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “First, you need to understand that outside of professionals, the only other people who knew about these events were myself, Lorna, and Swords. The reason I didn’t tell you earlier was that I wanted to control my own narrative and protect Swords. However, I believe your feelings about me won’t change, and Swords can protect herself. I’m still not telling you who she is, just in case your paths ever cross.” Agatha looked at Rio for confirmation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, “I knew there was still something, which is why I wasn’t sleeping well and then came down here when you weren’t in bed.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You were right. However, there’s something I need to tell you first. I wasn’t asleep earlier, and then with everything written in there,” Agatha gestured toward what was now one of her most prized possessions, sitting on the table. “I’ve been running from my feelings, and I have to stop. Rio Vidal, I am absolutely in love with you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      These were not words Rio was expecting to hear yet, and they were words she was willing to wait for, but hearing them made her heart almost burst with joy. She knew Agatha had things to tell her, but right now, she was just happy that Agatha Fucking Harkness was in love with her and finally admitted it. Rio surged forward, grabbing Agatha by the shoulders to kiss her hard and fast. There would be time for more later, but she had to kiss her right now. As Rio leaned back, she looked at Agatha and grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love you too, Agatha Harkness. Now, tell me everything.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled at her, feeling at peace even though she was about to share a part of her that she hadn’t shared with anyone. “I am going to, but I’m old, and I have spent too much time on this couch and not enough time holding you.” Agatha stood, holding out her hand for Rio. As they went back upstairs, Agatha began. “Remember how I told you that Swords didn’t want kids?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded as they walked back into Agatha’s room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, she continuously talked me out of it, and finally, at 33, I decided I would with or without her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had assumed their normal position, and Agatha sighed contentedly. Something about holding Rio gave her the confidence she needed to get through this. Agatha continued.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We had had a discussion, and I had asked her one last time about kids, and she shut it down and told me I couldn’t risk becoming like my mother. She didn’t know that I was already going through fertility treatments and had chosen a donor, the whole nine yards. It was my roundabout way of seeing where she was at for the final time. She shot it down, so I knew what would happen if I succeeded.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was looking down at Rio, who was, in turn, looking up at her. They had perfected this way of lying and talking, Agatha running her hand up and down Rio’s side, Rio’s hand in Agatha’s hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was doing the math. Nicky was born in 2008 when Agatha was 35. It had been a thing, the world’s favorite lesbian becoming a single mom thanks to science. It put women’s healthcare and fertility treatments in the spotlight. Yet another trailblazing moment for Agatha Harkness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, please tell me that it was near the end of the year, and it took a bit to get pregnant,” Rio looked at Agatha, concerned. Nicky’s birthday was in June, and Agatha’s was in March. She had been barely 35 when she had Nicky, and the math wasn’t mathing the way Rio wanted it to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave Rio a sad smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, baby. We’re getting there. I got pregnant pretty quickly. It was September 2006 when I told her about it. Anyway, Wanda and Nat were out of the country as Wanda was filming. Lorna knew, though. I wasn’t trying to baby-trap Swords. I made sure she knew that. I gave her the option to break up, and we did. Then, something changed her mind in October, and she decided to marry me and have a family. I had asked her so many times if she was sure, and she said yes.” Agatha sighed. “I lost the baby a few days before the wedding and told Swords. There I was, in November, on the beach with Lorna, a white dress and all…” Agatha’s voice trailed off, and Rio desperately tried to fill in the blanks and hurt this obviously caused the woman she loved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did she use the loss as her way out? To leave you at the altar? I’ll kill the bitch!” While she was so thankful she had Agatha, her protective side wanted to throw hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not the main reason, no. She initially put her career first, but it was a reason. She said the pregnancy clouded her judgment, and to play devil’s advocate, she never did want marriage and kids. I was still shattered, though. I was so desperately in love with her, and that’s the day I decided I was done with her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s heart hurt for Agatha. This woman, who seemingly had everything, hadn’t been allowed to have the one thing she wanted most: a relationship.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Does she work in Hollywood?” Rio asked softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, and before you ask, yes. We still come in contact with each other, and she has changed since then.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She saw the question in Rio’s eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, I wouldn’t. She could beg me to come back, and I would tell her no. She missed her chance and absolutely destroyed me. Comparing this to that, well, there’s no comparison. This? What you and I are building? This is pure. It’s not built on youthful infatuation and puppy love. We went in with eyes wide open and knew the risks. We have mutual respect, and we have our autonomy. This?” She gestured between them, “is real, Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had bared everything except for Swords’ true identity and how they met. She finally felt free of the secrets she had been holding.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt the intensity of the moment as she stroked along Agatha’s jaw and down the length of her neck. Her thoughts were overwhelmingly crowded, and she couldn’t separate them. What she did know was that she loved Agatha more than she had ever loved before and she couldn’t imagine why someone would throw away the opportunity to spend their life with Agatha and throw it away for some dumb career in Hollywood. She hoped Swords’ money and, Rio assumed, career made Swords happy because Rio was the true winner in this. Rio kissed Agatha before she looked at her again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have questions,” Rio stated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sure you do.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What does she say about Nicky?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took a moment to consider her response.
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
      “Honestly, I think she’s surprised I’m this involved.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good. That bitch,” Rio smirked. If she ever found out who Swords was, she couldn’t promise niceties.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha huffed a laugh, “What if it’s someone you like? It could be Cher.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked scandalized. “She is twenty-seven years older than you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The fact that you automatically knew that isn’t surprising at all. Would you believe that Cher’s “Believe” is about me? But no, it’s not her.” Agatha hated that damn song. “I have a question for you, though, about something you mentioned previously.” Agatha bit the inside of her lip, not sure how she was going to respond to the answer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew that Agatha had picked up on what she had said and knew this was coming as she motioned for Agatha to go on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “When you said that you and the supermodel from hell had been talking about marriage and planning a future…” Agatha trailed off, letting Rio take it from there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes,” Rio answered the unasked question. “We were talking about kids, even hypothetically planning it, very ‘talking rings and talking cradles’, though I know now that she is not the love nor the loss of my life. I told you Labor Day weekend that it was dependent upon who I was with, and you do come with a kid. Three, technically.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This was not a conversation Rio wanted to have right now. They both needed sleep, and she wanted to engage in other activities once she knew what day it was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha picked up on Rio’s hesitation and left it for now. She knew they needed to sleep, though that was not the activity she wanted to engage in. Being responsible was not for the faint of heart. However, neither of them had slept much in the past forty-eight hours, and that would not do for what she had planned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We can revisit everything later. Our sleep schedules are now nonexistent. It might be Thursday, and we have a big weekend ahead of us,” Agatha said as she kissed Rio’s forehead and settled in more. “Besides, I need energy to show you how much I love you. I hope you don’t have plans later today.”
     </span>
</p>

     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By Sunday morning, sleep schedules had returned to somewhat normal, and award season was kicking off. Agatha’s house was full of makeup artists, hairstylists, and stylists, and the boys had been sent on yet another caffeine run.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda and Agatha were having their hair done in Agatha’s bathroom, attempting to talk while having makeup applied at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am so excited for you actually to have Nat with you as your date, Superstar,” Agatha said, careful not to move her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They would have other security with them. Wanda deserved this. Vision was glad he didn’t have to do the whole dog and pony show and could just sit in the family sections with the boys and Alice. Jen would be working and checking in with everyone as she could. She had already briefed red-carpet correspondents and was currently texting other PR reps. Several of them wanted to make sure their celebrities were able to get pictures with Agatha and Wanda. Several young actresses were especially interested in being in Agatha’s orbit, and Rio was not amused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was trying very hard to keep down the emotions. She had been waiting for this for so long, and it was finally here. She would get to be seen, very publicly, with the true love of her life. They were skipping the whole girlfriend title, Jen putting them out there as partners. If she could, they would already be married, but even no-contest divorces in California took six months to finalize. No amount of fame could get around that. She and Agatha both tried.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s still so surreal. I finally get to be public with her, and it’s absurd to me the way it happened,” she was trying to talk without moving her mouth, and after all these years, she and Agatha could understand each other perfectly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled and was promptly scolded, “When are you proposing?”
     </span>
</p>

      “As soon as I fucking can. We know we’re getting married. We didn’t even have to have that discussion. I still want to give her the proposal she deserves. Enough about me, I’ll get in trouble if I cry and ruin my makeup. When are you proposing?” Wanda grinned with her eyes as she was instructed to hold her mouth a certain way for lipstick.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha choked on her spit. “I just told her I love her, Wanda,” A chorus of ‘awws’ went up from everyone within earshot. “I am not ready to think about marriage,” It was mostly true. Agatha had absolutely thought about it, and even though she didn’t believe you had to get married, she wanted to. Just not anytime soon.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, please. You would move her in here yesterday if you could. The two of you have played house all winter break. Billy called her Aunt Rio yesterday, and no one blinked an eye. Raven practically lives here now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s moving in, Wanda. Not marriage.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had thought about that one, though, and would suggest it when Rio’s lease came up for renewal this summer. Wanda rolled her eyes as she started getting dressed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “At least you’re moving faster than anyone else did around here.”
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      The red carpet for the Golden Globes was crowded with interview stations set up everywhere and cameras constantly flashing. The audience area was full of screaming fans, and many celebrities were taking pictures or stopping near the area so their pictures could be taken. Agatha and Wanda were stopped continuously, which meant Nat and Rio were as well. Wagatha were two of the most sought-after celebrities on the carpet, as were their current headlines. Wanda had an upcoming interview with Drew and everyone had questions about what she was going to say, though her only answer was, “You’ll just have to wait.” The two megastars were more than happy to talk about the film, talk up their fellow nominees, and gush about the women with them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With the hype surrounding
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Death’s Beloved,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Wanda and Agatha had used their red carpet looks to pay homage to their characters, as well as incorporate their signature colors. Wanda had gone with a one-shoulder floor-length black dress that was gathered at the right side with a ruby-encrusted silver skull, an ode to her role as a serial killer. The dress was cut up to her thigh on the same side and she wore red heels. Her hair was down in a side part, ruby red earrings that matched the heart necklace Nat gave her for Christmas.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda had convinced Nat to wear something that didn’t make her blend in or scream bodyguard, and Wanda was kicking herself for it because all Wanda wanted to do was skip the ceremony and go right back to the compound to their newly redesigned and refurnished bedroom and take the strapless dark red dress right back off Nat. Nat’s hair was up, and Wanda kept staring at Nat’s neck, thankful for makeup that covered the bruises and bitemarks Wanda may or may not have put there. Nat’s dress also had a high slit, and Wanda was making a mental note that Nat was to wear suits at awards shows for the rest of their lives, as she wondered if anyone would notice if they went missing for a while.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re drooling,” Agatha whispered in Wanda’s ear. “I get you’re making up for lost time, but you’re not ready for quickies at awards shows, angel. I’m the punchline for that joke in every single opening monologue.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew there would be at least one joke at her expense, most likely about her reputation. One year, it was a joke about looking under your seat for your designated time to meet up with Agatha in the bathroom. The joke was on them, though, that year. She had scoped out a room in the back and a beauty with whom to share it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had leaned into the FBI agent she played with a perfectly tailored suit. However, she opted for an eggplant purple corset underneath, her signature brooch perfectly in place, hair up in a twist, and the same purple stilettos she had worn on her first date with Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned to Rio and squeezed her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you ready for all of this?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave her girlfriend a comforting smile and a quick kiss on the cheek, grazing the corner of Rio’s mouth. Rio nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s time to get used to it, and I’ve had media training from Jen.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s smile was electric and purely for Agatha. She hadn’t been in Agatha’s life when she made the movie, but she was still extremely proud of her and her accomplishments. Rio wore a forest green halter dress that came down to mid-thigh. It was draped on her left thigh in a way that showed off a silver thigh chain that had amethyst stones and an amethyst A. She wore black strappy heels, and her shooting star necklace, and her hair was in loose waves around her shoulders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They chatted with friends, and the starlets were pulled and directed several different ways. Rio received several hugs from students' parents, some of whom were nominated in the same categories as Agatha, Wanda, or the movie itself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once the chaos of the red carpet was over, they entered the main hall and found their seats. The host’s monologue started, and of course, several jokes were aimed at Agatha and Wanda, who at this point of their career, took it in stride.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s a sad day for the women in attendance. If you haven’t had your gay awakening yet, Hollywood’s sapphic tour guide, Agatha Harkness, is in a relationship and is no longer offering her services. In a surprising turn of events, the straightest woman ever, Wanda Maximmoff, is a  lesbian. So if any of you had ‘hell freezes over’ on your Bingo cards for this year, cross that one out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Death’s Beloved is set to win everything at every awards show this year. So, if you are nominated in a category against them, you may go ahead and go to your after-parties. Sorry, everyone.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There were jokes at Tony’s expense and a few of their other friends before getting started on the awards. The first category was Film Supporting Actress, Wanda’s category. Why was Wanda shocked when she won? The coven would never understand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda immediately turned and kissed Nat. For the first time accepting an award, she was fucking kissing Nat. She had been waiting for the moment she could thank Nat from a podium and it was finally happening. She was shaking and had frozen. Nat mouthed, ‘Go, this isn’t your first time, go!’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grabbed Wanda’s hand and pulled her towards the stage. Wanda looked back at Nat, words formulating in her head. By the time they got to the mic and Wanda the award, Wanda nodded at Agatha, indicating she could handle it. Agatha stepped back next to the presenters.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took a deep breath and focused on Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I haven’t frozen when winning an award since I was a kid, and Agatha,” she looked at her best friend. “Was the one that dragged me to the stage then too. I have been waiting to say this on stage since I was in my twenties. Natasha, thank you so much for supporting me and always being there for me, you’ve always been there for me. I love you so much.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Just the responses to that were deafening, and she laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rarely do thank you speeches get that kind of response. I’d also like to thank Vis, Billy, Tommy, Agatha, Alice, Rio, Nicky, and Jen for supporting me and being there for me for all of these years and being the best family I could have ever hoped for…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She thanked the usual people associated with the film and gave a heartfelt thank you to the fans before adding. “Always live your truth. You, you can’t get back lost time.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked at Agatha, who grabbed her hand, and they walked off together. Nat met them backstage to go with Wanda to do a follow-up press interview, and Agatha went to get ready for her musical performance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio checked in on social media, most of which was positive, and she put it back in her clutch. Agatha would be performing the song from the movie soon, and Rio was excited to see Agatha perform live, something Rio had never been able to do. Rio was very thankful for her position at SHIELD as Rio knew quite a few people in attendance, and even though her three table companions were currently missing, Rio still had people to talk to and didn’t feel out of place. They had come back from a commercial break, and the hostess commented on Wanda being the only person ever to thank a soon-to-be ex in an acceptance speech.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony announced Agatha, as the board always thought it was funny when the two of them presented or announced each other, as they infamously did not get along. This time, he added, “the woman who happened to partially raise my daughter’s boyfriend, though I attribute all of his good qualities to Wanda, Agatha Harkness.” They always tried to throw each other off their game.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had been prepared and, thanks to her in-ears, was completely unphased. The hauntingly beautiful melody began, and the spotlight fell on Agatha, who was wearing a black ball gown as she began to sing. Agatha’s eyes were on Rio the entire time, and the song was quickly becoming a favorite. The experience was over incredibly too soon, and she was covered in goosebumps.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Everyone had returned to the table, and Agatha was back in her original outfit, arm draped over Rio’s shoulders as they watched friends and acquaintances get flowers for their hard work over the past year.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Death’s Beloved
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      lost Best Screenplay but won for Director and Score.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Best Song was up next, and while Agatha was used to this and calm, Rio was on edge. She had always been nervous watching from home, but being here, dating and in love with Agatha, was different and much more intense.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Agatha’s name was announced, she leaned over and whispered to Rio, “I save my big speeches, don’t get mad.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed Rio and made her way to the stage, where she met with the songwriters, making sure they went first. Then, she gave her very practiced Agatha Harkness smile and thirty-second speech. She thanked her family and friends, everyone who worked on the song, and that was it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda leaned over to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s taking a calculated risk,” Wanda explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, I’ve seen this show before,” and Rio had. She knew that the older Agatha got, the less joint awards became about her. That wasn’t the case when Agatha was younger, but now it was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and everyone else were right back on the stage after the next commercial break for Film Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It had been a long evening, and it was only eight when the last four categories arrived. Two of which were theirs, Film Drama Actress and Film Drama. First up was the Actress category, and Rio squeezed Agatha’s hands as they went through the nominees. She knew Agatha was the favorite, and that was her calculated risk. Rio wasn’t surprised Agatha won, but she was still elated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha loved it when she won for her sapphic performances. This film hadn’t pushed an agenda, it was just the story, and that story happened to be queer. Agatha smiled as she kissed Rio, reaching back to smack Wanda on the shoulder as Wanda made snide comments behind her. When Agatha reached the stage, she blinked against the blinding lights and looked around the room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wow, thank you for this,” Agatha’s eyes fell on Rio. “First, I’d like to thank Rio, my amazing girlfriend, for supporting me through the end of this past year and being there for all of us. I love you so much, and you are one of the best parts of my life. Thank you to my amazing family and friends. Wanda, thank you for convincingly playing my wife. That’s absolutely why we won tonight, and I am so proud of you, kid. Thank you to everyone who worked on this film and, most importantly, supported this film. Knowing that ALL stories are normalized now is truly a great thing to see, and I am so proud to be a part of it. To our boys, thank you for supporting us, and I am so proud of the young men you are becoming. Again, a huge thank you to everyone and all of you beautiful humans in this room. You’re all amazing.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha waved as she walked off to applause. She would do the media and press later. The movie was up for Film Drama in roughly ten minutes. She made her way back to the table, hugging people as she walked past them. She kissed Rio again as she sat down,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love you, Agatha.” Were the first words out of Rio’s mouth once they broke the kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave her a genuine smile. “I love you, too. I am exhausted, though.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat leaned over Wanda to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Almost done,  and put your shoes back on,” she instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had changed from heels to something more comfortable for most of the ceremony, Wanda and Agatha only changing when they were up for something.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave her a questioning look, and Agatha answered, “More press after, babe.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed. “The fact that I am wearing heels for you is a testament to my love.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<em>
<span>
       Death’s Beloved
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      won, and the awards season was off to a great start. As they headed to an after-party, Rio was reminded that they all returned to the real world in a few days. Everyone would resume filming, work, or school on Wednesday, and she dreaded it. For now, she reveled in the fact that Agatha Harkness loved her and everything was right in their world.

     Chapter End Notes
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      The next chapter or two will be rainbows, butterflies, smut, social media reactions, all the smooth sailing things before we have some final drama.
     </p>
<p>
      The main fic will conclude at the end of SHIELD's school year. Then we'll have one-shots, lore, the Lorna story, the Swords story, etc.
     </p>
<p>
      I do post sneak peeks during the week, and pics of Raven as everything must meet her standards. Of course.
     </p>
<p>
      Y'all are amazing.

     Chapter Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Everything is calm and right in the world of our beloved coven. Agatha is filming and coming home on weekends, Rio has a new role at SHIELD, and Wanda has her interview with Drew.
     </p>
<p>
      A nice, calm month-ish with Oscar nominations, the Grammy's and a realization for Nicky.

     Chapter Notes
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Triggers: SMUT. Two scenes. SPICE. Bit of self-inflicted blood, the woman was feral, okay?
     </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
      The Grammy's will be a one-shot later, because this year's Grammy's were a hoot and a half and inserting Agatha and Rio sounds like a blast to me.
     </p>
<p>
      Note: I kept Sokovia as a real country, so Wanda's native language is Romanian (sticking to the show). Nat occasionally speaks to her in Romanian and Wanda speaks to Nat in Russian, because they're effing adorable.
     </p>
<p>
      Thank you all for the love and for reading the words! More fluffiness and potentially getting back to some drama next chapter...
     </p>
<p>
      Oh! I've been obsessing over curating the perfect 'soundtrack' (Spotify playlist) for the past week). I need your recommendations for songs for each chapter. Thanks!

     </span>

     </span>

<span>
      “How has Rio not posted anything about her best friend being engaged to her girlfriend’s fixer?”
     </span>

<span>
      “Do you guys ever think we’re too parasocial?”

<span>
      “I swear this woman is a witch.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just shook her head as she closed out of her socials. While some comments she could do without, some just made her laugh. Class started soon, and it would officially be the Spring semester at SHIELD. Agatha had left that morning, though she would be back on Friday. Rio was trying to readjust to being back in a routine, and her pack of teenagers calling her Ms. Vidal again. With all of the developments over the break, she was not surprised when Lilia strolled in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put her phone down. She looked up and saw a flustered Sicilian in front of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes filled with concern as she checked the time. It was another fifteen minutes before students would be in class, and Lilia was usually in her office preparing for the morning announcements.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, I need you to fill in for Coach Carter for the girl's basketball team for the rest of the season.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio loved basketball. She had played for years, kept up with the WNBA, and used to coach. However, she didn’t think Lilia knew any of that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re one of the tallest actual lesbians on staff. I assume you play. Not to mention, you wear Phoenix Mercury shirts often. You played in college and coached at your last school. I did read your resume, Vidal.” Lilia kept looking at her phone as if waiting for a call or message at any moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did Peggy go into labor this morning?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew Peggy was due soon. She was far enough along that the baby would be healthy, and that was the only reason she could think of for her to miss the rest of the season, though Rio could have sworn she saw Peggy in the lounge earlier.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not yet. Anyway, Daisy Johnson will fill you in on everything,” Lilia’s phone rang, and she answered automatically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, Steve, I’m on my way there right now. Go ahead and take her to the hospital, well, I told you both she would go early…” Lilia’s voice faded as she left Rio’s room and rushed down the hallway.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head as Alice popped her head in the doorway, “Peggy’s having a baby!” Alice said excitedly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know. Lilia just assigned me to the girls’ basketball staff. She’s psychic, I swear. So unless you want to be stuck here after school, separate cars it is.” Rio explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Bonding with your future daughter-in-law!” Alice grinned as she ducked back into the hallway when the rock-shaped stress ball sailed past Alice’s head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had decided to take lunch in her classroom so she could go over the folder Morgan had brought her from Coach Johnson. The roster, remaining schedule, and potential for the playoffs were all there. She wasn’t sure what athletic voodoo or super serums Rogers and Carter were potentially giving their athletes, but the girl’s basketball team was potentially better than the football team and had a better chance of going to state. Morgan, and a few of the other girls, were already being scouted by universities as juniors. SHIELD held many surprises and the sheer amount of budding athletes running around this place was one of them. According to Alice, this was the first year in at least a decade that the SHIELD Superstars had done well in any sports outside of track and archery. Rio hadn’t wanted to tell Lilia, but she was excited about the coaching opportunity. The season was cut short for her last year when her previous school pulled her from the coaching staff the millisecond she filed the restraining order against Lou.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She knew this was just for the rest of the year, and she was only the assistant coach, but it felt good to get back into it. She already had ideas for a staff vs. student game and hoped she could get on the court with the team. As she began reliving memories of her days playing in high school and college, she received a text from Agatha.

       inseparable
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      since the events of the previous week, and even though they had just parted this morning and would see each other Friday night, Rio felt like her heart had left the country.

      Rio felt Agatha’s eyes watching her as soon as Agatha entered the gym Friday night. It was still early in the game, and they were tied. So far this season, the Superstars were undefeated, and the two coaches didn’t plan on letting them lose now. Rio had donned a black suit with a white button-up shirt, the top two buttons were undone, gold heels to stick to school colors, and her hair was clipped up. She held her clipboard as she shouted directions from the sidelines. She looked more like a college coach, which was what Rio preferred. She idolized women like Kim Mulkey and Pat Summit and always emulated that when she coached. Rio loved knowing that Agatha was now seeing Rio in her element: in control, wearing something she knew Agatha loved seeing on her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Coach Johnson now deferred to Rio and let her call the shots, and the team performed better following her lead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda leaned into Agatha, “Did Rio just dom Daisy for control of the team?” Wanda whispered into Agatha’s ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think she did. Damn.” Agatha gave a low whistle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She preferred to be in control, but watching Rio coach was something she had never seen, and she had zero right to feel like this at a high school sporting event. Alice leaned forward from the row directly behind them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “At her previous school, parents with zero ties to the basketball team often showed up to support the team.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Their section was there to cheer on Morgan and support Rio. However, the merry band of Sapphics understood exactly why a parent would tell their kids they were going to support the basketball team just for fun.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky still had his arm in a cast, but Rio had allowed him to be on the sidelines and play water boy so he could be supportive. Rio had pulled Morgan out of the game for a few minutes because her temper was getting to her, and when Nicky tried to offer Morgan words of advice, she nearly bit his head off. Nicky sidled up to Rio and looked at her, confused. Rio didn’t take her eyes off the game.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “NEVER tell a woman how to play their game, Nicky. You’re smarter than that. If you’ve built up a - PLANT YOUR FEET KHAN, trusting and respectful relationship where you can give each other constructive criticism, then you can plan times for it. Never in the heat of the moment. LOOK AT CHAVEZ!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The game went to halftime, and Rio looked up at the tall teenager.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She never told you how to fix your aim when you threw an interception, remember that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio patted him on the shoulder and gave him a loving, motherly smile as the team went into the locker room for ten minutes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha saw the whole exchange, and while she couldn’t hear it, judging by the look on Rio’s face, it had been something sweet. Agatha had never planned on sharing her son with someone she was involved with, and she melted at the thought. That mixed with Rio’s confidence and domineering persona while coaching and Agatha wasn’t sure how she would make it through the rest of this game. Agatha turned to Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We might not make it back to the compound tonight.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, really?” Wanda deadpanned.

      Rio had forgotten to load the auto-feeder for Raven. She lamented needing to stop by her apartment first when all she wanted to do was go home with Agatha. Agatha wasn’t mad at the lost time, as Rio saw it. Instead, she rode with Rio to the apartment to maximize what little time they had together before she had to be back on the set.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had barely stepped into the darkened apartment, Rio sitting her backpack down, when Agatha was on her, pushing Rio’s back against the door, pressing the fronts of their bodies flush together. Her mouth was on Rio’s in a needy kiss; one hand caressed Rio’s cheek softly, and the other gripped her hip tightly, Agatha’s nails leaving half-moons in her tanned skin. Rio carded her hand through Agatha’s hair at the base of her skull and placed the other hand on Agatha’s backside, massaging her buttcheek through the denim of Agatha’s jeans. Rio kissed Agatha back just as needily, pausing for a moment to look at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I missed you,” she rasped, staring into the ocean-blue eyes that felt like home.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled back. Rio’s eyes were already dark brown pools of desire.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love you,” Agatha said, resuming the kiss before Rio could respond. Rio would never tire of Agatha Harkness saying those three powerful words.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha used her thigh to nudge Rio’s legs apart as she slid her denim-clad thigh right up against Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio whined at the slight friction, moving her hips to feel something more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha moved her hands to meet at Rio’s sternum and slid them up and under the suit jacket as she mirrored her movements across Rio’s collarbones, pushing the jacket off Rio’s shoulders. Agatha gave Rio just enough room to shimmy out of the jacket as it fell to the ground. She kissed along Rio’s jaw up to her ear, sucking her earlobe between her teeth. Rio let out a small hiss as she slid the hand that she had on Agatha’s ass to the hem of Agatha’s hoodie and tugged, still trying to feel something from Agatha’s thigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed, reluctantly pulling back a few inches from Rio, causing Rio to whimper as she moved her leg. Rio quickly removed Agatha’s hoodie and shirt together, throwing them on the ground as if their mere existence had personally offended Rio before attempting to tangle her hand in Agatha’s hair and resuming their kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pushed her back against the door and leaned in, right next to Rio’s ear, “You’re still overdressed, coach.” Agatha made a long lick down Rio’s collarbone while expertly unbuttoning and discarding it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Does someone have the hots for the coach?” Rio asked as her bra was removed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hummed an affirmation while she circled one nipple with her thumb while sucking a bruise on the side of Rio’s tit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio moaned at the sensations. Her clit was already pulsing, and heat in her lower abdomen continued to build. Agatha had admitted Coach Rio turned Agatha on. It didn’t matter how many times they had made love. Knowing Agatha was attracted to her would never get old.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I like it when you take charge.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha breathed across one of Rio’s hardened nipples. Rio grinned wickedly as she took a fistful of Agatha’s hair and used it to turn Agatha’s face upwards to look at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Drop to your knees, Harkness,” Rio growled, immediately releasing her hold on Agatha’s hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha dropped to her knees as she was told, raking her nails down Rio’s sides, kissing Rio’s stomach and along the waist of the black pants. Agatha loved the sounds Rio made and knew exactly where to touch and kiss to elicit them. Agatha’s hands continued down Rio’s thighs and she kissed her over the fabric, where Agatha knew Rio wanted her attention. Rio might be giving orders, but Agatha was still very much in control.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Undress me, Harkness,” Rio ordered, and Agatha was more than pleased to oblige.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, Coach.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She grinned up at Rio and undid the two buttons, making a show of pulling the zipper down with her teeth, slowly sliding Rio’s pants off her legs, and leaving the gold heels. Agatha felt her stomach tighten as she rocked back on her heels and leaned back to take Rio in. Agatha raked her eyes over the woman she had against the door, wearing only gold heels and light green boy shorts that betrayed how aroused Rio was. Rio was beautiful, and Agatha planned to ruin her in the best of ways.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio glanced down before taking another fistful of Agatha’s hair and tugging her forward towards Rio’s cunt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We can do sweet later. Right now, you have a job to do.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, Coach.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grabbed the top of Rio’s panties with both hands and forcefully pulled them down, helping Rio out of them. The heels were staying on. Agatha lifted Rio’s right leg and hooked it over her shoulder, kissing Rio’s thigh in the process. She kissed and licked along where Rio’s inner thigh met her body, feeling the muscles already trembling against her cheek. Rio used her free hand to palm at one of her breasts, twisting her nipple. The hand still in Agatha’s hair attempted to pull her closer to where Rio needed Agatha’s mouth to be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Impatient?” Agatha crooned, her mouth right above Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s body was on fire from just Agatha’s teasing, and she rocked her hips forward, searching. Agatha kissed across Rio, placing a very light kiss right above Rio’s clit, continuing to move to the other thigh. Rio used the grasp she had on Agatha’s hair to move her head back to where she needed it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes,” she murmured, watching as Agatha flicked her eyes up to meet Rio’s and ran the flat of her tongue up Rio’s slit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio threw her head back against the door as Agatha held her steady, lapping at Rio’s entrance. Rio moved her hips in a steady rhythm against Agatha, desperate for more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tightened her grip on Rio’s thigh, using her other hand to spread Rio enough for Agatha’s tongue to thrust into her, keeping a steady pace. She knew Rio wanted hard and fast and would give her that. First, she wanted to taste her and build her up. Agatha had a long night planned. They had plenty of time for anything Rio wanted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Harkness,” Rio tried her best to go back to her coach's voice and failed. “Enough teasing. Make me…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her breath hitched, and she let out a loud low moan as Agatha’s tongue began flicking across her clit. Rio rutted against Agatha’s mouth and face, one hand tightly wound in her hair, the other firmly planted against the door, trying to hold herself steady.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s tongue alternated between circling and flicking around and across Rio’s pulsing clit, and Agatha knew Rio was close with how furiously she was fucking Agatha’s face and how blissfully loud she was. Agatha buried herself in Rio, increasing her rhythm and pressure when Rio’s entire body shuddered, Rio’s leg quaking against Agatha’s cheek as Rio cried out with pleasure, and Agatha steadied her as she rode out the orgasm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha carefully and slowly placed Rio’s foot on the ground as she stood, keeping a tight grip on Rio. Agatha wrapped an arm around Rio’s waist and took Rio’s chin in her other hand, kissing her hungrily, still pressing her back against the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Trust me?” Agatha breathlessly asked Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “With every fiber of my being,” Rio rasped, eyes blown as she gazed at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good, because I’m just getting started. Wrap your arms around my shoulders,” Agatha instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio complied and was surprised when Agatha grasped the back of her thighs, picking her up effortlessly. Rio automatically wrapped her legs around Agatha and kissed her hungrily. Fingers splayed across the muscles of her upper back. Agatha carried Rio to the living room and stopped next to the arm of the couch. Rio was careful not to break the kiss as she set her own feet back on the floor and ran her hands down the lines of Agatha’s back, following the band of Agatha’s jeans where she undid the button and slowly unzipped them, pushing the pair of pants downward before Agatha kicked them off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s breath caught as Rio cupped her through the lace thong she wore. Rio could feel how much Agatha had been affected just by using her tongue on Rio. Agatha widened her stance and pushed Rio’s hand away, then turned Rio around, bringing Rio’s back against the front of Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not ready for you to touch me yet,” Agatha whispered, kissing the back of Rio’s neck and along her shoulders, Rio arching into the touch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Bend over for me, Rio,” Agatha purred, and Rio obeyed, allowing Agatha to guide her a few steps before bending over the arm of the couch and bracing her elbows on the cushions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha positioned herself behind Rio, placed a hand on the small of Rio’s back, and slid the other between Rio’s legs, ghosting over a very wet core.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Still wet?” Agatha teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded as she pushed her pelvis back towards Agatha. Agatha was rotating between circling Rio’s clit and dipping two fingertips into her entrance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was moving faster, trying to encourage Agatha to pick up the pace, and Agatha responded with hard thrusts to the knuckle. Rio gasped and leaned forward, pressing herself onto her forearms. Agatha leaned over Rio, kissing the back of her neck and shoulders anywhere she could reach. Rio’s movements became more frenzied as she drew closer, her head going fuzzy and her body clenching around Agatha’s fingers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It only took Agatha barely brushing against Rio’s clit with Agatha’s other hand for Rio’s head to fall forward as she completely gave over to the sensations. Agatha continued her movements, adding pressure and a third finger as Rio continued moaning, gasping, and encouraging Agatha on, never wanting her to stop.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Fingers curled as pressure was increased, and Rio’s back arched into Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s it, baby, come for me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha bit into Rio’s shoulder as Rio gave a final cry. Agatha kept up with her movements until Rio begged her to stop. Agatha slowly and gently withdrew from Rio and helped her stand back up. Only then, helping Rio toe her heels off, keeping her arms wrapped firmly around Rio’s waist. Agatha felt Rio trembling, whether from their activities or being cold. It didn’t matter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ri, can you walk?” Agatha kissed into Rio’s hair as she held her against her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t wait for an answer. Agatha easily scooped Rio up in her arms like the princess she was and carried her into Rio’s bathroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This is not the bedroom,” Rio looked at Agatha, pupils still blown.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Pee, clean up. I’m getting water, and I’ll be back,” Agatha instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha returned to the bedroom to see an empty bed, except for a very judgmental cat. She placed the water on the nightstand and turned to find Rio when her eyes landed on her, leaning against the door frame of the bathroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio still felt a bit wobbly and wasn’t quite ready for more, but had taken a moment to just appreciate Agatha for who she was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “See something you like?” Agatha held out her hand and led Rio to the bed. Agatha had taken off her now useless thong, and Rio appreciated that, too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I see someone I love very much,” Rio settled next to Agatha after she drank a healthy amount of water.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Gah, we’re cheesy,” Agatha scoffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged. “We are, but no one has ever carried me during or after sex just to make sure I don’t hurt myself. You’re the only lover I’ve ever had that gave a damn about aftercare. You think it’s important that I have a few moments to recover before I make you forget your name,” Rio winked at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My ego is too big for me ever to forget my name.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re not wrong.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio kissed Agatha on the cheek as she grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s not just about these moments either. You support me. You spent a Friday night at a high school basketball game because I was coaching. You’ve sat next to me memorizing lines while I lesson planned, even before we were technically dating.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio caressed Agatha’s cheek, overwhelmed with the amount of love she had for this woman in such a short amount of time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What do you mean technically dating? We started doing things like that early on. End of August? We both had work to do but wanted to have a movie night still,” Agatha huffed and smirked. “We really did fall into a routine that was not exactly friends, didn’t we?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow, “A few weeks in, and we couldn’t stay overnight somewhere without sharing a bed. Aggie, what do you think?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled to where she was partially on top of Agatha and kissed her sweetly before deepening it. The night was still somewhat young, and neither of them planned on getting much sleep.

      Wanda took a deep breath as she looked over herself in the mirror. Her makeup was perfect for the HD cameras, still with America’s sweetheart vibes. Her hair was partially pulled back, and she wore a black jumpsuit with a red blazer. She looked very Wanda Maximoff™ Wife, Mother, Girl-Next-Door. Wanda sighed as she put the necklace from Nat back on. The stylist that told her not to wear it could fuck off. She took off the wedding ring that some producer insisted she wear, though Wanda nor Drew liked that idea. Wanda and Vision had naturally stopped wearing their rings on Christmas when they announced their divorce to the world. She wasn’t putting it back on for an interview. Wanda loosened a few strands of hair, so they framed her face and unbuttoned the blazer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Asta pare mai natural,”
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       now that looks more natural,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Nat walked into their bedroom, where Wanda had been getting ready. The interview was being held at home as a special interest piece, not a part of Drew’s regular show.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The only person I want to be,” Wanda turned away from the mirror and kissed the woman next to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you ready to do this?” Nat’s eyes searched Wanda’s for any hint of doubt. Nat and Jen would shut this down in an instant if Wanda weren’t ready.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am, finally. Whatever happens, we can face it,” Wanda smiled brightly and went in for another kiss. “Ya tebya lyublyu.”
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I love you.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat took Wanda’s hand to lead her downstairs. There were no threats here, but Nat would always do what she could to keep Wanda protected from anything, even if it were just stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Te iubesc.”
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I love you.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda and Drew were now sitting in the living room for the question part of the interview. They had walked around outside, and moved around different parts of the house, showing Wanda Maximoff the person, not the megastar. It would be edited together to show a normal afternoon between Drew and Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Of course, the background story left out how they actually met and went with the ‘met while out partying with Agatha’, which was partially true.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had made the story a bit more suitable for public consumption, though they left the important points about how the industry could curate how someone was perceived, such as the need to be closeted if you were packaged and branded in a certain way, and the need to hide who she was for so long.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda, you and I are close friends, and we’ve known each other since we were teenagers,” Drew smiled genuinely. “We’ve discussed all of these questions, so none of these are surprises,” Drew added the disclaimer so neither of their fanbases would be upset when the update aired.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Right, and that’s why you’re the only person I would do this interview with. We know too many things about each other to not be honest.” Wanda smiled, and they both laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Drew put a comforting hand on Wanda’s knee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ready?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Let’s do it.” Wanda took a breath, knowing that she was about to get a mix of general and fan questions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did Vis know?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That question right off the bat? Well, as I said, when I was going through the history, I was always upfront with Vision. When he and I first started dating, he knew about Nat. When we got engaged as a PR response to the leaked pictures, he suggested we call off the engagement. Vis has always known, and there was never any dishonesty there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I did have beards, though he was not one, and they are all out now and extremely encouraging of this. I have always had Agatha’s support. She truly is my family, and I always had Natasha and Vision’s support. I never meant to betray or lie to anyone. It just grew into something bigger than myself.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Drew blinked away a tear. “What about the boys?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They all had workshopped and practiced this answer to make sure she wouldn’t be skewered for anything she said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The boys have always known, even though we never said anything. We thought not telling them was the right thing to do. That way, we didn’t have to worry about anything leaking, the boys saying anything, etc. We just raised them all together. Agatha had Nicky, and he automatically had four parents. Then, when Vis and I had the twins, we did the same thing. We did tell them before this came out on Christmas since we had decided to separate and announce everything after the first of the year. The timing was just a few weeks earlier than planned.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So the twins are okay with everything?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Absolutely. Nothing is technically changing for them, just where the adults live. No custody battles, no smear campaigns, we will just be a larger and slightly more dispersed family.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They went through a few more questions that fans had asked to keep her image squeaky clean. No, no one was cheating. No, again, it wasn’t a bearding situation. Yes, their love had been real once. Yes, the boys were biologically Wanda and Vision’s, red and blonde did make brown hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Drew looked at Wanda, the loving and adoring friend.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “As we wrap up, what would you tell others who may find themselves in this situation? Or anyone faced with a similar situation?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda returned a watery smile. “Always be yourself, and don’t hide who you are. I have received so much overwhelming support, and even if I hadn’t back then, I would have come back from it. We can’t get back that time, and while I don’t regret anything, Vis and I both know that we should have separated years ago but stayed together for the sake of my career, afraid of what could happen. However, I have truly been the happiest I’ve ever been since coming out and making this life-altering decision, and he has been too.” Wanda looked past the cameras to where Vision and Nat stood, smiling proudly at her. Vision nodded in agreement, and Wanda focused back on Drew, “so again, be yourself and do what’s best for you and your family and this is what is best for ours.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda closed the laptop and set it aside. She and Vision had just watched the edited interview, and they were both pleased with how it turned out. He gave her a squeeze around the shoulders and a kiss on the temple. She laid her head on his shoulder, and they sat like that for a few quiet moments. They would always be an integral part of each other’s lives, with a closeness that would always be there. Wanda was thankful that Nat understood the dynamic and was okay with the pet name, head kisses, and otherwise intimate gestures. Wanda worried that any future partner of Vision’s would not feel the same way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Vis, do you think you’ll date?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Actually, darling, I was going to talk to you about that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda sat up and turned to face him. “I was just asking as a hypothetical, what?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He chuckled. “Jealous?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Surprised, actually.” Her eyes were wide. He had never so much as glanced at another woman in all the time she had known him. “You’ve never mentioned another woman to me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision grinned at her, waiting for it to hit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Holy shit. It’s not a woman.” She stated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He shook his head, “No, there is a man however,”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “IT’S HERB!” Wanda blurted. Herb was another professor at UCLA and had been Vision’s racquetball partner for years. “Racquetball indeed, sir!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We are just racquetball partners and colleagues, though there is an interest there. When the story broke, he did text to offer his condolences, though the emojis he used suggested that he was not upset about it,” Vision recalled with a smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda did not need the details of that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m so happy for you, Vision,” she hugged him and kissed him on the cheek. She loved the life they had curated on the compound, even if Vision would be moving off of it in a few weeks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Still moving into the house a few blocks away or waiting to see how things go with Herb?” She teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not a lesbian.” He reminded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh shit, I owe people money,” She remembered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did you have a betting pool going?” He deadpanned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have betting pools on everything.”
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      Rio did not like Agatha being gone for longer than a weekend, and she wasn’t sure how she would handle it when she was on an entirely different continent for months. They were still newly dating, and when they were together, they couldn’t take their hands off each other. It was Wednesday of the second week, and filming had been extended through the rest of January. Agatha would be home on Friday, but three days was apparently too long for Rio. They had spent the entire weekend together, most of it naked, and yet…
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was getting into bed when the text popped up.
     </span>

      would you?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled. She knew exactly what Agatha was referring to. She had bought a set of wearable vibrators for them. They were controlled by apps on their phones. She was wondering when Agatha would find it or notice the new app on her phone.

<p>

      Agatha loved technology. She set the U-shaped vibrator aside and grabbed her iPad. She would need a bigger screen for this experience. She brought up a secure connection and then the FaceTime app and waited for it to connect to Rio’s iPad.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That was fast,” Rio laughed as she answered. She was wearing a Witches Road sweatshirt with Agatha’s name scrawled across it, black glasses, and Agatha saw a glimpse of purple briefs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Menopause has heightened my libido,” Agatha deadpanned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is that your excuse?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You helped,” Agatha answered truthfully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio blushed. “If you don’t want to do this…” She started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I very much want to do this. I want to tie you to the bed and make you take my cock, but unfortunately…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was already lightly touching herself. When it came to Rio, she was constantly on. Anywhere, anytime. She had a mental list of fantasies, but they hadn’t even covered a fraction of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s mouth went dry remembering the one time they had incorporated the strap-on and how she’d like to bring that out again. She loved it when Agatha tied her down and wanted to explore everything with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, we have plans for the weekend, is what I’m hearing.” She tried to sound sexy and failed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked. “Don’t worry,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       kitten
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , we’ll go at your pace.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio poked her tongue in her cheek at the mention of their safeword, ‘kittens’.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Want to tell me about these plans?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio placed the iPad so that Agatha could see all of Rio and not miss anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha situated her iPad before taking her oversized sweatshirt off, she hadn’t been wearing any underwear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It got very hot in here all of a sudden.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes. “Lamest excuse in the book, but I’m not complaining.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took in the view, watching Agatha ghost a hand over her breast. How was she so effortlessly sexy? Rio reached down to tug her sweatshirt off when she heard Agatha tsk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, that stays on. I want to watch you come with my name across your chest,” the tone of Agatha’s voice was commanding and dripped with want and desire.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m all yours, Agatha.” Rio bit her lip as her eyes followed Agatha’s hand on the screen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha trailed her hand down her toned stomach and to her pussy. She placed the vibrator and phone right in front of her for when they were ready. Agatha looked straight into the camera at Rio. “Take off your briefs and spread your legs,” Agatha commanded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio loved it when Agatha was demanding, but the added distance made it even hotter somehow. She slid her underwear down her legs and tried to kick them off sexily, only for them to get caught on her ankle, and she turned bright red before shyly spreading her legs. Rio wasn’t shy. She was just slightly embarrassed by her failure.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha ignored it, dragging a finger through her folds while honing in on Rio. “Good girl,” Agatha purred, erasing all hints of embarrassment from Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A quiet moan echoed in Rio’s throat from the praise and the sight of Agatha. Rio hadn’t even touched herself, and she was wet. The things Agatha Harkness did to her were beyond explanation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can you insert your vibrator, baby?” Agatha’s voice came from the device. She knew Rio was probably already ready for the toy, and Agatha knew she was ready.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, grabbing for the toy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Perfect,” Agatha growled. “So am I. Put the toy in your wet pussy so I can fuck you with it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyes were loving, commanding, and predatory at the same time. The intensity heightened the moment even more for Rio as she inserted the vibrator and positioned it on her G-spot, placing the other end on her clit. She would adjust as needed. Rio watched as Agatha placed hers, and they both pulled up the app. Agatha read Rio’s mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re in control of it, and if I want anything specific, I’ll tell you. For yours, well, when you need to tap it out, the word is kittens.” Agatha smiled at her scandalously. They had talked about boundaries previously, and Agatha knew that Rio wanted her to take charge like this and would put an end to it if she needed to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gasped as the bulb inside of her began at a low thrum, the part on her clit at the same speed. Rio looked at the options on the app. She knew Agatha enjoyed higher pressure and started her off at a medium vibration on her G-spot and a medium tapping on her clit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Morse code mode?” Agatha raised an eyebrow after her initial shock.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know what a good dash-dot-dash does to you,” Rio smirked, remembering the time she spelled out
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Rio
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      in Morse code with her tongue on Agatha’s clit. She shuddered as Agatha slightly increased the intensity of the vibrations.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What plans do you have for us?” Rio asked, slightly moving her hips in vain for more friction, legs still spread for Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was in a similar position to Rio, noting that the tapping had changed to vibrating as her eyelids fluttered in response. “Many,” she responded seductively, only for Rio to stop all stimulation, causing Agatha to pout.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s no…” She was cut off as Agatha turned both intensities completely up, which was not the retaliation Rio was expecting. She braced her feet on the bed, and her toes curled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “FUCK! AG…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was gone immediately. Agatha had turned it off. When Rio looked back at the screen, there was Agatha, grinning from ear to ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t mess with the master, kid. Now, are you going to be a good girl?” Agatha dropped back into the sexy and seductive voice Rio loved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, ma’am, I’m sorry.” Rio whimpered with a pout.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s better, baby.” She turned Rio’s toy back on, slightly increasing it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed into the sensations. She loved their dynamic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wiggled against the bed, finding the perfect amount of friction. “This weekend, I plan to tie you down, wrists and ankles, so that I am in complete control.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was massaging her inner thigh, envisioning being tied down to Agatha’s bed. Agatha, with her hand on Rio’s throat when she kissed her. Rio felt the intensity grow as she increased Agatha’s by two levels.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha bit back a moan, describing her weekend wishes to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I want to leave my marks across your chest and down your stomach. Scratch your thigh for me, baby,” Agatha’s mouth watered when Rio took both hands on either side of her core and scraped them up her thighs, automatically leaving marks and drawing a little blood. Rio gasped with the sensation, and Agatha knew that Rio was dizzy with the stimulation. Agatha increased the intensity, watching hungrily as Rio pressed the toy into her and bucked against it, swearing and saying Agatha’s name, her eyes slammed tight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wasn’t going to let her come, not yet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh baby, you’re so close for me, and I can’t even touch you,” Agatha teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “God, Agatha. I’m going to co…” The intensity returned to low, and Rio’s eyes flew open in desperation. “No, baby, I was such a good girl,” Rio whined.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, baby, you were. I wasn’t ready for my sweet girl to come yet.” Agatha cooed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio melted every time Agatha used any type of affirmation for her. It only added to everything she was feeling. Rio turned Agatha’s sensations up, watching as her pupils dilated more, and Agatha tried to steady her breathing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Set it to cycle so you don’t lose focus, baby. Medium for three, high for two, low for one. Do that for one cycle, and then as high as it will go.” Agatha instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at her skeptically as she followed the directions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Now, set that aside and focus,” Agatha directed. She could tell the pressure was building again, and Rio needed release. “While leaving marks on you, I’ll play with your hard clit, drawing circles around it in the way you like.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha increased the levels of intensity again and stimulated her own breast and nipple with her free hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’ll beg for my fingers and tongue, but you won’t get them.” She added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had pressed the toy against herself again, trying to get as much pressure and sensation as possible, Agatha increasing it again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Will you let me have your cock?” Rio panted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, baby. I’ll undo your ankles so you can wrap those legs around me while I thrust into you.” Agatha’s breath kept catching as she neared coming undone. Her brain was getting increasingly hazy, and she was dripping as much as Rio was. She saw how much Rio was desperately trying to hold on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What do you want, Rio?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Make me come, please, Agatha. I want to be a good girl for you,” Rio begged into the camera.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pressed the buttons and watched Rio’s mouth drop open wordlessly. Agatha’s timing was perfect when her own vibrator hit max intensity, and her body began to jerk and spasm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh God, Rio!” She cried out, the orgasm ripping through Agatha as she refused to let up, riding back-to-back orgasms, enjoying the delicious intensity of it until she had to press the off button that was on the side of the toy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, FUCK.” Rio closed her legs, only making the pressure more intense, separating them once again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha forced her eyes open so she could watch Rio, and just as she had imagined, watching Rio lose all control, with Agatha’s name across her chest, was one of the most beautiful things she had ever seen. Agatha didn’t own Rio, and she didn’t believe she did. However, Rio was giving a piece of herself to Agatha, and she was fully Rio’s as well. Rio spasmed again as Agatha turned the toy down to the lowest level.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s my sweet Rio. I wish I could be there with you, baby. I promise to make it up to you this weekend.” Agatha took her in, realizing just how fucking lucky she was. “Again?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked into the camera, “Agatha? Kittens.”

      Alice clicked through the different tabs she had open for wedding venues, trying to narrow it down as she yelled in frustration. This startled Jen, who sat in their bed next to her on what was otherwise a nice, quiet Wednesday evening. Jen’s townhouse had sold, and she had moved in with Alice while their house on the compound was being built.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Everything okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked over at Alice with amusement as she closed the book she was reading. She knew what Alice had been working on and had found it entertaining how seriously Alice was taking the entire process. Alice slammed the computer closed and placed it on the nightstand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No. Everything’s either booked out for over a year, or there’s a minimum guest requirement. I don’t need a huge wedding. I need you, our friends, and an officiant. And I want to get married around Spring Break,” Alice slumped against the headboard and looked over at her fiancée. “Is that too much to ask?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smiled softly at Alice and placed a hand on her shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why don’t we elope? Or, well, elope but take the core people because Rio would murder me if she weren’t there. We can have a big reception after.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A slow smile started to form as Alice thought it over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We get married at the beginning of break, have a short honeymoon, you will take me on a longer one later, and have a reception the following Saturday before we go back to school?” Alice thought out loud. Jen’s own smile widened.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s a date. Want to do the cliche Vegas wedding?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My mother would personally haunt me if I didn’t.” Alice huffed a small laugh. “We still need a venue, though.” Alice started to worry again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good thing we know a guy that loves a good party.” Jen returned her book to her nightstand and turned off the light. “Now kiss me, and let’s go to sleep. One of us has teenagers to wrangle tomorrow, and thankfully, it’s not me.”

      “Dude, it’s time to talk with her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tommy Maximoff said Wednesday night. The three boys were sprawled around the game room at the Maximoff house, where they usually camped out when Nicky stayed with them if Aunt Aggie was out of town. The room was dark, and they were supposed to be asleep. Instead, they talked through Nicky’s current dilemma.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy had created a nest of cushions and blankets and looked toward Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You love her and need to see how compatible this will be,” he added to his brother.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky sighed. He was on a couch, curled under a blanket.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t know. How do I even approach the conversation with my mom?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tommy scrunched his nose from the TaunTaun sleeping bag he insisted on sleeping in. “Why do you have to ask Aunt Aggie?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because it’s her house? And her girlfriend!” Billy shot towards his brother.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky sighed. He loved his younger cousins.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have to tell Mom where I’m at with Rio. Mom is obviously serious about her. We’ve all seen it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Total simp,” Billy agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Right,” Nicky confirmed. “While I love staying here, Aunt Wanda and Aunt Nat need to be able to be together with you two as an actual family unit.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Aunt Nat had finally moved in with Aunt Wanda, and Nicky was so happy for them. Uncle Vis decided to stay at the clubhouse until his house closed, and the place never looked so clean or organized.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tommy snickered, “Nothing has changed. Nat’s always been a mom figure. Now they just kiss in front of us.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They play tonsil hockey in front of us,” Billy clarified.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m just glad our moms had the foresight to soundproof bedrooms.” Nicky mused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “YOUR mom did that. Our mom did not. We are scarred for life.” Tommy informed him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Anyway,” Nicky continued, “I need to ask Mom if Rio can stay the rest of the filming schedule at House of Harkness so we can bond more. I should just be honest with her, right?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was more rhetorical than anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, she needs to know that you want to learn more about Rio and how her living in the house would go. Also, cat bonus.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy grinned. All three boys loved Raven and always hoped she’d be at Aunt Aggie’s when Rio was there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, I’m gonna text her.” Nicky nodded decidedly.
     </span>

      No. It can wait until Friday. I want to talk to you in person.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chewed at the skin on the side of her ring finger. Was the other shoe about to drop? Was this about Morgan? Or even worse, Rio? Was Tony about to murder him for something Nicky did? The possibilities were endless when it came to her son as she stared at the phone. She wondered if there was a possibility she could get home early, but knew there wasn’t. She had to film until late afternoon and wouldn’t be home until around noon on Friday. She was thankful they followed an American schedule and had a four-day weekend with SHIELD.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She huffed, and where she would normally pick Wanda’s brain, it was Rio who she texted, even though they had just hung up from their very spirited FaceTime session.

      Nicky was waiting at home when Agatha arrived on Friday. He was on the phone with Morgan and hung up when he saw his mother come in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, mom! Can we talk once you get settled?” He asked, still somewhat anxious about the whole thing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha picked up on his nerves and immediately started thinking of worst-case scenarios. Had he cheated on Morgan? Committed felonies? She had always been very upfront with him to stick to basic misdemeanors. Was this about Rio? Agatha dropped her things on the end of one of the couches before settling in her usual spot and patting the spot next to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Come sit, kid. Tell me everything.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky took a huge breath as he trudged toward her, the death march playing in his head. He plopped onto the couch and lowered his eyes with a sigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s about Rio, mom.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha deflated. She would always put her son first, even if it meant losing the woman she loved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay,” She nodded. “I’ll talk to her, and we’ll put an…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky’s head popped up, “What?! Wait! Mom, what do you think I’m about to say?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tilted her head and gave him a look of pure confusion.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That you don’t like Rio, that you want me to break up with her?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh! God! Mom! NO!” He was bewildered. For someone so smart, how could she be so bad at reading her own son? “No, I want her to come stay with me while you finish filming!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He rushed the words, only to see more confusion on his mother’s face, and he continued to rush forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The twins need time to get settled into new routines and having Nat as even more of a mom, and Vis needs time to adjust to being somewhat single. Rio and I need to see how well we would do without you here as a buffer since you won’t be here every day. I know I have to ask her, but I have to ask you first since she is your girlfriend, and it’s your house, Mom. I just know you two are serious about one another and if the next logical step, no matter when it is, is her moving in with us, then we have to know how well we cohabitate.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was panting after the word vomiting he had just done when he looked up at his mother, who was, crying?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mom, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pulled him into a tight hug. “I love you so much, Nicholas.” She pulled back and looked at her son, truly her number one. “Yes, we can talk to Rio and see what she thinks. It’s up to her, and we don’t want to scare her off, got it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky nodded and grinned. “Mom, she’s seen you first thing in the morning, no makeup, giant glasses, full-on morning breath. You couldn’t scare her away if you tried.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha attempted to give him the mom look, “You, sir, are an asshole.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He returned one of her signature smirks, “I learned from the best.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha couldn’t help but smile. She had taught him well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had come over shortly after Agatha and Nicky’s conversation, with Raven in tow. They ate dinner at the kitchen table, and Rio was somewhat suspicious of Nicky’s presence since he spent all of his time with the twins or Morgan. After Nicky cleared the dishes, he sat back at the table and looked at Rio very seriously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, Mom and I were talking, and since changes are happening at Aunt Wanda’s house, and I want to stay in this house more, will you stay here with me while Mom is filming?” His face was hopeful, and he looked much younger than sixteen at that moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned toward her girlfriend, “Are you sure? I’d be parenting him a few days a week. Are you sure you’re okay with that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you going to let him do anything stupid?” Agatha countered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not intentionally, no,” Rio answered honestly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then yes. I would love to know that you are caring for o…my son. Waking up in ou…my bed every morning. I just wish I was next to you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was stroking her hand up and down Rio’s thigh and looking at her softly. Nicky cleared his throat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, you guys are doing that thing where you make it weird and gross, so I’m leaving now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He waved as he left to meet the twins at the clubhouse.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked back at Agatha, “You almost said ‘our’ twice.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha put a finger to her lips in thought, “No, don’t recall that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sure you don’t.” Rio smiled before turning serious. “You’re sure you trust me with him?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha held Rio’s hand and ran the pad of her thumb across her knuckles.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course I do, why wouldn’t I? If you can keep a roomful of teenagers alive around open flames and chemicals, you can keep one of them alive for a few days.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Raven gave a meow of doubt from a few feet away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve kept you alive, you traitor.” Rio glared.

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once Agatha had left, it was easy for Nicky and Rio to establish a routine. When they got home from basketball practice, Nicky did his homework while Rio made dinner, and they cleaned up the kitchen together. With Coach Carter’s blessing, she appointed him a coaching assistant, and they would go over different plays and drills. Morgan would sometimes come over after practice, and Rio would have to play the mean mom by not letting them go anywhere in the house unoccupied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even if it was just a few days, she thought she was doing a pretty good job, and they were bonding over video games, music, and other common interests. They FaceTimed with Agatha for the Oscar announcements, but they were only slightly surprised when both Wanda and Agatha were nominated for Best Actress. Rio had Agatha on Facetime as they got ready for school and watched the broadcast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was thrilled that Wanda had been nominated for lead and really hoped that her sister would win instead of her. Agatha and Rio chatted a bit more before they hung up. Rio looked at Nicky, who had also been watching them as they sat in her classroom early.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What do you think?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He sighed. “Is it bad that I do hope Aunt Wanda wins more than Mom?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thought about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, not at all. Your mom wins a lot in everything. Wanda is amazing, and so was her performance. However, the people who vote for The Oscars, well, a lot of them are going to feel betrayed and lied to.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew that as stupid as it was, there was a possibility that Wanda would lose votes solely because of what Lou did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s really stupid,” he grumbled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I agree with you. People live vicariously through celebrities and put too much pressure on them to live a certain way. Just because Wanda should get the Oscar doesn’t mean she will, and it’s not right or fair.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky nodded and looked at Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re really insightful, considering you’re not that old.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smirked. “Thanks, it’s the trauma.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was another Friday night basketball game, and Agatha wasn’t going to get in until late due to filming. Nicky’s cast was off as he gestured wildly on the sidelines, and both lead coaches shouted at the team.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicky! You’re not a coach. Sit down!” Daisy yelled at Nicky, face red, and steam practically radiated from her ears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You just called a play that we didn’t have the right people for, and it was disastrous because you didn’t want to let Rio call it!” he spat back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Both of you! Nicky, you know better than disrespecting an adult and undermining the coach in public. And Daisy, he is a child. Both of you, cool it!” Rio barked before turning back to the team on the court.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Daisy turned to Nicky and did not see him as a student at that moment but as yet another member of the Rio Vidal Fan Club.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She doesn’t care about you. She’s just trying to get to your mother.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her words were meant to sting, and they did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was a Harkness, through and through, and did not back down. His mother had taught him not to fight women, but he was about to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re just jealous because she’s a better coach and, apparently, better for my Mom.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He was fuming, and the Harkness temper was about to come out when Rio called a time-out and stood in front of him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Daisy,” Rio said calmly. “It sounds like this is between you and me, not something to take out on my son. I will finish this game without you. You’re dismissed.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Daisy opened her mouth to protest, and Rio gave her The Look™. Daisy closed her mouth and turned on her heel, only to see Lilia Calderu giving her a similar look as Daisy followed Lilia out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio quickly turned to Nicky to see him looking pale and staring at Rio. She put a comforting hand on his arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Go sit with Wanda and calm down, okay? I’ll kick her ass in the parking lot. Go.” She jerked her head in the direction of the bleachers. He gave her a small smile and went to find the rest of his family.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio realized the team had gone relatively silent, as had much of the crowd. She shrugged and turned back to the team.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Stop gawking. Time-out is over, and we’re about to lose. Let’s go!” She shouted as everyone snapped back into action.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky recounted the scene with Daisy to his aunts, uncle, and cousins. He looked at his Aunt Wanda,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She called me her son. I don’t think she even caught it. I know we’ve joked about it, but” he shook his head and took a deep breath. “I need to talk to my Mom.” He finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. “She’ll be home later tonight.” She assured. She couldn’t imagine how Nicky was feeling. She rubbed his back as he kept his eyes on Rio. Morgan glanced up at him questioningly, and he gave her a thumbs up. The other teenager didn’t believe he was okay either.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Smart Girl.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Wanda thought before texting the events to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio got her head back into the game, and SHIELD barely won. She would need to talk to Coach Carter in their next catch-up about what happened. The team debriefed, and Rio walked back through the gym, knowing everyone else had already left, when she saw Lilia waiting for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You did great with Daisy.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio scoffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What was that about, anyway?” She asked as Lilia fell into step with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Daisy is still young. She had her chance to emerge from Peggy’s shadow, and you immediately eclipsed her in the first game. You have done what no other woman before could do and stole Agatha Harkness’s heart, something most teachers here have tried. You have endeared even the most stubborn of parents to you, several students are highlighting teenage bullying and inequality in schools across America, you nudged Wanda Maximoff out of the most see-through glass closet, and you finally forced Alice and Jen to admit their feelings. You didn’t expect jealousy?” Lilia looked at the younger woman expectantly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re not speaking riddles,” Rio parroted Agatha from months ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t know why everyone points that out. For some reason, new life makes me even more observant,” Lilia mused, referencing Steve and Peggy’s newborn son, James.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ah,” Rio studied Lilia for a moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why me, Lilia? Why offer me the position and bring me out here?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia hadn’t known her. She just came to San Francisco at Alice’s request last Spring and offered her the position.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I trust Alice, and she wanted to keep you safe. I knew you would be a good fit, and you have been, in many ways. Now, I have a few security things to take care of. Start prepping for playoffs, coach!” With that, Lilia walked off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We haven’t made it that far!” Rio called after her, but the woman didn’t reply.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky made it home to the compound before Rio did. He had given Morgan a quick hug and kiss before promising to call before bed. He was relieved to see his Mom as he sat next to her and buried his head on her shoulder like a little kid.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did Aunt Wanda tell you what happened?” He asked in a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She ran soothing fingers through his hair like she often did when he was a little boy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, and I’ve talked to Lilia.” She had also verbally eviscerated Daisy, but he didn’t need to know that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio called me her son.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I heard. How do you feel about that?” Agatha still wasn’t sure how she felt about it. She loved it and was scared at the time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Honestly?” He pulled back and looked her in the eye.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Honestly. No cap, or whatever the kids are saying,” She gave him a sarcastic smile as he groaned. Parents should not use teen slang.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky thought about it, letting the words marinate. “I know we’ve joked, and I’ve called her dad, which is still funny because it’s Rio, and she gives those vibes,”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fair.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But it’s always been you and me. Aunt Wanda, Uncle Vis, and Aunt Nat too, but you know what I mean,” Nicky looked up through long, thick eyelashes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew exactly what Nicky meant. He would always have this family, but Agatha was his anchor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love her mom, and she’s a good addition to our family. I don’t want to say a missing piece because we aren’t incomplete, though we were sorely lacking in the ancient cat god department,” he said as Raven jumped into his lap and purred.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think those choose the human, not the other way around,” Agatha mused. “What part about it scares you?” Her stomach dropped at the look on his face. “Right. Still me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you blame me, Mom? I got into an argument with a grown adult because she’s jealous of your girlfriend as she’s one of I don’t even want to think of how many women you’ve slept with. I’ve defended you since I was a kid. I should not know this much about my mom’s extra-curricular activities. I’m sorry if I worry.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had always tried to keep her hobbies away from Nicky but knew he would be exposed to them, no matter how hard she tried.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have changed, Nicholas.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, Mom. Just know that she really is becoming like a mom to me, even if it hasn’t been that long, okay? Or at least until I get in major trouble and she has to put her foot down. I might change my mind then.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Headlights washed over them as Rio drove up the long driveway.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s my cue since you two tend to get gross. I love you, Mom,” he hugged her before heading up to his room, Raven in his arms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha woke up the Monday morning after the Grammy’s, thankful there was no school and that she could hold Rio in her arms. The ceremony had been a celebration of women, queerness, POC, and just fun. Rio had been a pure chaos demon with Taylor, and Agatha had taken it all in. Agatha had won her third Grammy, and while that technically gave her her triple EGOT, she wasn’t counting it until she won her third Oscar for Best Lead Actress. She was an overachiever after all. She had thanked Rio first last night, causing several of her friends in the industry had lost their minds, including the younger sapphics in the crowd. It truly was a great night, and she looked forward to always having Rio next to her as her forever date for these events and all of the memories they would create.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her phone brought her out of the lavender haze as Nat texted the group chat, instructing everyone to put their clothes on and meet in Agatha’s living room in forty-five minutes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why MY house?” Agatha grumbled as she kissed Rio awake.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Forty minutes later, everyone was in Agatha’s living room with the TV on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Care to fill us in, Nat?” Agatha asked, nursing her second large thermos of coffee and still grumpy about being awake at eight in the morning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I received some information last week, and this morning, one of my…shadow associates, if you will, told me to watch the news at this time. So here we are.” Nat was focused on the TV.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys were groggy but had been dragged from their beds for this. Jen and Vis were the only two that looked put together, the others all looked as if they put on the nearest, cleanest, most acceptable articles of clothing and game over or downstairs, which is what they had done.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hush, it’s starting!” Wanda quieted everyone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Breaking news! Out of San Francisco,” The reporter started. “We go now to recently disgraced supermodel Lou Franco’s house where the FBI has identified her as the person behind many high profile jewelry thefts…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The color completely drained from Rio’s face as she clapped a hand over her mouth, and the other rubbed those too-familiar circles on the left side of her chest. She wasn't sure why she was anxious or crying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was Lou, glaring into the camera, in handcuffs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      All eyes in the room landed on Rio. Agatha put her arms around her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s over,”  she whispered into Rio’s ear.” in an attempt to soothe her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen turned to Nat, “How’d you finally do it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat stood there, watching the oversized screen, taking it all in. Yes, she had gotten documents and fingerprints, but they weren’t necessarily the ones that would tie all the heists together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t do this.” Nat started. “ I provided some evidence to an associate, but this wasn’t me,” her voice was low and hollow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Whoever it was, they’re on our side, and we can breathe more easily,” she said assuredly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at the screen. Things were going well at school. She was coaching again, Wanda and Nat only had a few months until they could get married, Jen and Alice were beginning to plan their wedding, all the boys were doing well, Vis was settling into his life, the boys were doing great, and she and Agatha were doing well. The Oscars and Spring Break were coming up, and best of all, Lou was gone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked back at the screen just in time to see Lou look into the camera as her lips curled into an evil smile, “Te veo, pet,” she mouthed before passing out dramatically as the camera cut off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I see you.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just shook her head. “Nope, bitch is gone, and all is well.” She decided.
     </span>
</p>
<p>

     It was Valentine’s Day, and as cliche as it was, Wanda was going to propose. She was tired of waiting, and with everything finally being calm, now was a good time. She looked down at the dark wooden box in her hand, opening it to reveal the black titanium engagement ring inlaid with red diamonds and a red ruby in the center. The ring had never been worn despite being purchased over twenty years ago.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Aggie, I’m going to propose to Nat,” Twenty-four-year-old Wanda Maximoff said decisively to thirty-year-old Agatha Harkness.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha was sitting in the living room of the house in LA, which they shared with Nat, who was out on a run. She set down the script she was reading and looked at the young girl in front of her.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Oh honey, do you think you’re ready for that? What about Vision?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Wanda had thought of that.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Yes, and I love him so much Aggie, but Nat is the one. I don’t care what the fans say,” Wanda sat down next to the woman who had become her older sister over the past eight years.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha smiled and extended her hand, “Let me see the ring.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “How do you know I have a ring?” Wanda asked indignantly.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Because you always do this when you see rings that remind you of her. I assume you saw the perfect ring, no one was there to tell you no, and you bought it.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Wanda’s entire face flushed. Agatha could read anyone, especially Wanda. She sheepishly handed Agatha the box, pouting that the older woman had been partially right.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Close, I saw one I liked and had this, and the matching band custom made.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha opened it with a smirk, having been proven mostly correct, and let out a sad sigh when she saw the ring.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Oh, angel, it’s perfect.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She looked at Wanda with a sad expression, gripping her hand.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “You WILL get to put it on her hand one day, and I will be by your side either as your Maid of Honor or the one giving you away.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Wanda nodded, a tear sliding down her cheek. She knew Agatha was right. Wanda wouldn’t have the courage to do it, no matter how much she wanted to spend her life with Natasha.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda closed the box and tucked it in the pocket of her maxi dress. Agatha had been right. The concert had happened a few days later, and everything after that was a blur. Here they were, over two decades later, and Wanda would finally get to propose. She had her speech, decorated the gazebo out back, and planned what to make for dinner. Everything was ready down to the music; she had practically grown up in the movie industry, so the cinematics were inevitable.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat could be covered in mud and wearing a potato sack, and Wanda would still think she was the most gorgeous being in the universe. Wanda knew she would remember the jeans and Lilith Fair hoodie Nat was wearing for the rest of their lives as they sat outside watching the sunset on the cold February evening around the firepit in the gazebo, drinking hot chocolate and snuggling together after dinner. It had been a quiet Valentine’s evening at home, which was precisely what they had wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you remember our first Valentine’s together?” Wanda asked, moving closer to Nat.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat smiled at the memory.
    </p>
<p>
     “We were living at the clubhouse, and Agatha was still teaching us how to cook. You were much better at it than I was, though that’s not saying much. You tried to make Beef Wellington and almost burned the house down. We had to order pizza, and then we watched
     <em>
      But I’m A Cheerleader
     </em>
     for the hundredth time. Agatha was gone that night, and when she got home, she laughed for a good ten minutes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda laughed at the story. “I was trying so hard to impress you!”
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t need to! We had been together for a few months, and I was already completely in love with you. You could’ve made me a Hot Pocket, and it would’ve been the best day ever,” Nat took Wanda’s hand and looked at her with pure love.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about the first concert we went to?” Wanda prodded, eyes dropping down to Nat’s hoodie.
    </p>
<p>
     “1998 Lilith Fair. I spent most of the festival trying to keep track of Agatha. You and I, however, danced very inappropriately to Missy Elliot, considering we were just friends and I was your bodyguard...”
    </p>
<p>
     “You were definitely guarding my body,” Wanda interjected.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat smirked as she continued, “and gave new meaning to the song ‘Something to Talk About’.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda just grinned. “We do cause a commotion at concerts, don’t we? Spice Girls, Warped Tour, NSYNC, Madonna, Lollapalooza,” they had been to so many over the years, she couldn’t begin to name them all. “Good thing we can be out now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Music is important to us, and we tend to get carried away. Now we can.” Nat leaned forward, kissing Wanda. “My turn to ask a question: do you remember the first time I officially acted as your bodyguard?”
    </p>
<p>
     “YES! It was for the Emmys! Agatha and I were up for Sisters! I couldn’t stop staring at you in that suit! I should’ve known I wasn’t straight, but I kept telling myself I was just envious that you pulled it off so well.” Wanda laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Solnyitza, you should have known. Every guy you were set up with was PR. Nothing happened with any of them. Vis was the first and only man you ever did anything with, including unscripted kissing,” Nat reminded.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda thought back on all of her so-called relationships.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good point. However, the same can be said about you, zvezdochka, star. You’ve been the only woman for me,” She scoffed. “Forty-five, and I’m still the girl next door.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Forty-six in two days,” Nat reminded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Remember my thirtieth birthday?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha threw you that eighties-themed birthday party and made everyone dress as their favorite eighties character! It was so cute! I still don’t know why you got so mad at her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda huffed, “Because Nicky was almost one, and what no one else saw was Agatha teasing me all night about how I wasn’t getting any younger and I needed to choose my baby daddy,” She rolled her eyes. “She also brought Nicky over earlier that day in a shirt that said, ‘I love my aunts and uncle’. Lorna kept telling Agatha to lay off.” Wanda shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “If it weren’t for Agatha, I never would have met the love of my life,” Nat caressed Wanda’s cheek. “Besides, you have two baby daddies. Those are my boys, too.” Nat pulled Wanda in for another sweet kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     When they parted, Wanda looked up at Nat, glad that her plan was going the way she wanted. “Do you remember when we found out I was pregnant?”
    </p>
<p>
     Nat’s face softened, a smile still on her lips as the clear visual came into her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll never forget it. You came out of the bathroom, test in hand, and we stared at it for what seemed like forever. We were in Budapest on a set, and you had gotten sick. You thought you were just sick when the doctor on hand sent you to your trailer with a pregnancy test. We watched in agony as it turned positive, and even though we weren’t technically together, I was so happy. You weren’t mine, no, but Wanda, I was always yours, and I am so grateful that I was allowed to be there every step of the way. You called Vis, and he told you he knew you were in good hands for the rest of the shoot.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda was trying not to cry, and while she had more memories to bring up, she knew it was time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Moya zvezdochka, my star, I’m getting cold. Will you grab a blanket from the chest?” Wanda asked, giving Nat her best puppy dog eyes. Nat rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have two perfectly good legs, but yes, solnyitza, sunshine, I will.” Nat got up and walked across the gazebo to fetch the blanket in question.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nat, do you remember the time I proposed?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t be silly, you’ve never…” the words died in her throat as she turned around to see Wanda down on one knee, holding an open box with the most beautiful ring Nat had ever seen. The blanket fell from her hands as a hand flew to cover her mouth, and tears filled her eyes. It was finally happening. Her feet propelled themselves toward Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     As she cleared her throat, Wanda had tears of her own, watching Natasha walk toward her. “Natasha, I have loved you for twenty-five years, and I so badly want to be yours. You have been by my side through every up and down in my life since I was eighteen. You were the first woman I ever kissed, the only woman I’ve ever loved, and one of the few people I’ve shared everything with. You are a parent to my sons, the person I want to fall asleep next to every night, and the person I wake up to every morning. So many of my best memories are with you, and I want to create more of them for however many years we have left. I want to grow old with you, make out at concerts, and actually impress you with my cooking skills now that I can,” Wanda laughed through her tears, remembering the multiple cooking failures they had both had. “You are the one I want by my side at every event, in every picture, in every way imaginable.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have wanted to put this ring on your finger for so long and never thought this day would come. I know this is the most cliche day to ask you this. Natasha, you are the love of my life, the person I have been madly in love with since we were kids, who patiently waited for me, who supported all of my decisions, maddening as they were. Will you finally marry me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Tears streamed down Wanda’s face as she looked into Nat’s eyes, awaiting her response.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat had knelt in front of Wanda, tears of her own mirroring Wanda’s as she nodded. She held out her shaking left hand as Wanda slid the ring on her finger.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, Wanda. I will absolutely marry you. No matter what day you asked me.” She smirked, swiping at her tears. “You have always been it for me, and I would have been content just being here, a part of your world. Being with you again is something I had only dreamed of.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nat leaned forward, hands clasped in between them. She slid her lips against Wanda’s, bringing a hand to Wanda’s cheek, and smiled into the kiss. It was sweet and slow, tips of tongues swiping across each other, not quite going deeper. Wanda whimpered as Nat pulled back.
    </p>
<p>
     “One moment, îngeraș, angel,” Nat stood up and brought Wanda with her. “You’re not the only one that has been holding on to something for a ridiculously long time. I was trying to wait until your birthday.” Nat said, fishing a box out from the pocket of her hoodie.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because that’s not just as cheesy.” Wanda sniffed, new tears creeping from her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “You still win on that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nat laughed as she opened the box, revealing a gold ring with a ruby heart. The band was braided with a row of diamonds on either side.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda, when you sent that text a few months back, my heart stopped. I watched you play house for decades, and I would do it again and again if it meant being even a fraction of your life. You asking if you could be mine were words I never thought I would see or hear. They were wishes and dreams. I couldn’t get back here, back to you, fast enough. We have loved each other in secret and lived for the stolen moments for so long, and to finally be ourselves has been freeing and amazing. But know that I would do it again and again if it meant that I would still get to be with you. I love you so much, Wanda, the Sunshine in my day. Will you marry me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda was ugly crying, and she knew it.
    </p>
<p>
     “You already said yes,” Wanda sobbed a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just give me this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, my North Star, I will marry you.” Wanda grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat placed the ring on Wanda’s finger, wrapping her arms around Wanda’s waist and kissing her passionately before turning off the firepit and leading her to their bedroom.

     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had never planned an actual Valentine’s Day. She had absolutely ‘celebrated,’ but a proper date? It had never been her thing in the past. She had tried with Swords but had been shot down. Maybe it was time to start tackling the Swords' trauma with her therapist. She shoved the thoughts aside. Tonight was not the night for those memories. Rio had offered to plan the night, but this was something Agatha wanted to do.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Except her plans were shot when Rio turned into Coach Vidal, and there was a basketball game on fucking Valentine’s Day. The rest of the coven didn’t even come since her kid was the only one technically involved, and her girlfriend was the coach. She could salvage it, right? But then, it was a doubleheader, and Rio was coaching both JV and varsity due to the JV coaches having some mystery flu. Calderu had suspended Daisy from coaching until March, and no matter how much Agatha had tried, Lilia hadn’t let up.
    </p>
<p>
     That’s how Agatha found herself in the gym at SHIELD, cheering alongside the Starks and the Langs, wearing a SHIELD jersey with VIDAL Number 13 across the back.
    </p>
<p>
     Tony smirked, leaning across Pepper to talk to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I never thought I’d see the day Agatha Harkness had another woman’s name on her,”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d never thought I’d see the day Pepper would give you your balls back, and what do you know? I still haven’t,” Agatha shot back to Pepper’s laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     “She has you there, honey,” Pepper added.
    </p>
<p>
     Tony turned bright red.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good thing Nicky learned from his other parents,” he grumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     “For the most part,” Agatha smirked before turning to Pepper as Tony returned to his original place. “Morgan is a really great kid. Are you sure it’s okay for Nicky to take her out after this without an adult chaperone?”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky and Morgan had planned to go out to a diner and a late movie with a pass, stating it was a school event. If they did get pulled over and caught, Agatha and Tony planned to play the megastar and extremely famous director card to get around the California state minor driver rules. Misdemeanors, not felonies and all that.
    </p>
<p>
     Pepper smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     “I trust them both to make good choices, and I trust you two to get them out of any trouble they could potentially get into. By that, I mean I trust our collective legal teams,”
    </p>
<p>
     “Smart girl,” Agatha smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     They continued to cheer the team on. Junior varsity had already played, though they still sat on the bench out of support and respect. Tommy had come along to support Cassie Lang. They were ‘hanging out’ and not necessarily dating. Neither of them wanted labels, stating that they were too young for that and only freshmen. Yet if you asked Billy, he and Eddie were going to get married, Eddie was going to be a doctor, Billie would follow in his mother’s footsteps, and they would have two point five children, two cats, matching Subarus, and work closely with LGBTQIA+ organizations. The twins could finish each other’s sentences but were as different as night and day.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned to watch Rio and Nicky as they coached in sync. They made a great team, and it made her heart flutter. Rio was back at her apartment during the week now that filming had wrapped up, and Nicky missed her. Agatha hadn’t addressed the ‘My Son’ comment with Rio, and Rio hadn’t brought it up, but Agatha found Rio catching herself slipping and purposely not saying it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was lost in her thoughts when she felt eyes on her and looked over to see Lilia staring at her, the old bat. Agatha just glared at her and flipped her off. She was still mad about the basketball game situation. Lilia rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     SHIELD won yet another game and Agatha said her goodbyes to the other parents while waiting for Rio when Lilia pulled her aside.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want?” Agatha said coldly.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t remain angry at me for a schedule created before I made Rio the coach,” Lilia said with an exasperated sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can be rather stubborn.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m painfully aware Agatha. You can still have a good night and watch your movies. She has tests to grade this weekend, no matter where she is. Also, she had a rough day. Just be there for her, not whatever extravagant thing you tried to plan to sweep her off her feet with tonight,” Lilia suggested.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are the one to be giving me romantic advice? Why the sudden interest?” Agatha asked suspiciously.
    </p>
<p>
     “Even Hollywood playboys deserve to settle down eventually, no matter with whom, Agatha. Besides, happy coaches win games. Winning games leads to state. Winning state propels the school,” Lilia smiled. “It may also be time to address when she called him “her son” - everyone heard it, and I am sure you haven’t approached it.” She added before turning away and briskly walking away with a wave over her shoulder. Agatha had known the woman forever, and she was still often confused by her. She shook her head as she turned to see Rio headed toward her, looking exhausted.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took Agatha’s hand, kissing its back. “I love the jersey, m’lady,” she looked around as the gym cleared out, eyes landing on Morgan and Nicky as the teens walked up to them.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re headed out, and I’ll be home by curfew,” both teens hugged the women.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up at her son. “Be very careful. Watch for deer and insane blondes, got it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, Mom,” he hugged her again and looked at Rio, “Another great night.” He waved as he took Morgan’s hand. “Good night, Happy Valentine’s Day. Love you, Moms!” Nicky flashed another smile, and they left.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to Agatha, “Did he call me mom in a non-joking manner?”
    </p>
<p>
     “He did.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio remembered the last time she became attached to someone else’s children. Three blonde kids she would still do anything for. The oldest was in college now and all three crossed her mind occasionally. She couldn’t take losing another kid, set really, as she considered the twins partially hers as well.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should probably discuss this.” Rio’s face was solemn as she watched Nicky and Morgan leave the gym.
    </p>
<p>
     “My house?” Agatha watched Rio carefully. She knew Rio had referred to it as home before but didn’t want to push it right now.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your house. Where’s Tommy?” Rio scanned the gym for the Maximoff they were supposed to be in charge of.
    </p>
<p>
     “He went with Cassie and family for pizza and a game night. Vision will pick him up later.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s what the kids call ‘hanging out’ these days?”
    </p>
<p>
     They started walking to Rio’s car as they continued their conversation.  Agatha shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s so different from when I was a kid. Then again, I snuck around on movie sets and in trailers. My teenage dating life wasn’t really typical.” Agatha recalled.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened the car door for Rio like she always did, and Rio rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “No wonder you make all the women swoon,”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m oozing with charm.” Agatha leaned in, kissing Rio. “I’m sorry our first manufactured day of love isn’t more romantic.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Spoken like Agatha Harkness. Let’s go back to the compound and talk about the whole son thing. We’ve been pushing it off long enough. Then we’ll go from there, okay?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They sat on the couch, a movie playing in the background.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay that I called Nicky my son? It really did just slip,” Rio asked, drinking a cider and watching Agatha’s expressions.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve thought about it, and I am. It surprised me at first, but more because I’ve never had a serious romantic partner that I saw as his other parent before. Swords came around when he was born, and I think she considered it for a minute but ultimately decided against it.” Something dark slid over Agatha’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean, she bailed after the first pregnancy ended. I shouldn’t have been surprised when there was an actual baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hated this Swords bitch. “But you have concerns,” Rio surmised.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky is still concerned about the me factor,” Agatha confirmed with a sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     “He loves you. He trusts you. You are becoming another mom to him, and it scares him how fast it’s happening. However, there’s still my past and reputation. I’m not exactly the poster child for steady relationships.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m proud of you for communicating and being open and honest.” Rio wanted to validate Agatha before she shut down. Sometimes, she had to treat her with teacher gloves. “I love him very much, as if he were my own, but it did happen very quickly, and I can back off some. I’m still going to be protective of him, but if I overstep, just tell me. I love you and will respect all of your boundaries.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Damn Rio. I am a powerful woman, and you just come in here, break down my walls, and make me completely vulnerable in every way except physically.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have a gift,” Rio smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now, I heard you had a bad day. Come here and tell me all about it,” Agatha adjusted so Rio could lay against her and vent all she needed to.
    </p>
<p>
     “I teach high schoolers, and it was Valentine’s Day. I also had the freshman biology class dissect sheep hearts, so that was fun. Do you know how many students I had to pull apart from each other today? Khan and Chavez were like sapphic bunnies. They were EVERYWHERE too! I do have a very decent supply of candy and chocolate in my desk drawers, though, and I ran a carload of flowers and stuffed animals home after school before the game.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha almost interrupted her to tell her she didn’t see any of those things around until she remembered Rio meant her apartment and not Agatha’s house. Rio was still recounting her day.
    </p>
<p>
     “The gifts do not matter to me, but it’s so sweet that they bring me things, especially at this level. So that wasn’t bad. I could’ve done without some of the teasing from the jealous teachers though.” Rio rolled her eyes. “Lilia keeps shutting it down, and then I feel like a teacher’s pet. I still love my job and wouldn’t trade it for anything, but I’m about to take Nat to work with me one day. My yearly evaluation is coming up soon, too. I’m worried the coworker dynamic will affect it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ran her nails along Rio’s scalp.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure it won’t, baby. There’s nothing to worry about.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Says Agatha Fucking Harkness. Oh! That reminds me, I got you something. It’s in my school bag,” Rio hopped up from the couch and retrieved a card from her bag that she had sat at the table. When she returned, Agatha was holding a gift box of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked around, trying to determine the origin of the box.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hid it under the couch,” Agatha said cooly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course you did. It’s not much, but here, you go first because I went first at Christmas,” Rio instructed as she sat back on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, Coach,” Agatha handed Rio the box, opening the envelope. The card was sweet and held tickets to the Beach Life Festival for the first weekend of May.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s mainly for Alanis, Train, Sublime, Lenny...okay, there’s a lot of people we like. I thought we could make a weekend out of it since it’s a four-day weekend for us anyway.” Rio pushed her hair behind her ear, looking down sheepishly. Agatha leaned forward and kissed her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love it and look forward to making memories with you. However, I think we’re beginning to think alike. Open yours.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head questioningly as she opened the box revealing plane tickets that had ‘Harkness Airlines’ on them with Lima, Peru as the destination, tickets to see Shakira, and a pack of gum.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is this because of how badly my ears popped the last flight?” Rio laughed as Agatha nodded. Rio looked closely at the dates. “Wait, Aggie, this says we leave tomorrow!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Concert is Monday, got you out of your teacher workday on Tuesday, and Lilia took care of Wednesday for you. I couldn’t get you out of the game tonight, but I did get you out of Wednesday. Alice, Wanda, and I packed for you. Alice and Jen will Raven sit. Lesson plans are also taken care of, courtesy of one of your backups that you already had in your Google Drive.” Agatha had planned everything.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha Fucking Harkness, if I wasn’t exhausted…”
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s always time for that later. It’s a 9-hour flight. Now, let’s get those sore muscles of yours into a hot bath, and I will take care of you, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s breath caught at the new pet name,
     <em>
      my love.
     </em>
     That was the one, the one that fit them the best.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “So why did you choose Shakira?” Rio asked Agatha as they cuddled on the private jet.
    </p>
<p>
     “I appreciate your Latin roots. Also, it’s Shakira,” Agatha trailed her fingers up and down Rio’s spine.
    </p>
<p>
     “I liked her better as a brunette, and I prefer her older stuff, Ms. Know-it-all,” Rio began to sing “Perteneciste a una raza antigua, De pies descalzos y de sueños blancos.” then kissed Agatha’s neck, eliciting a sound from her girlfriend that made her thankful the few crew members were back in the enclosed area of the jet.
    </p>
<p>
     “You do have a type, and I may have made a few requests for the set list,” Agatha put an arm around Rio, pulling Rio onto her lap. “I love when you sing to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took the hint and straddled Agatha, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     “How did I get so lucky?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gazed into the sapphire blue eyes of Agatha Harkness. In them, she saw the hope and promise of their future and at the same time, she still wasn’t sure what their future was. They hadn’t been together that long, but she still wondered.
    </p>
<p>
     “I believe I’m the lucky one here, my love,” Agatha kissed the hollow of Rio’s neck. “You came to LA and all.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pushed other thoughts aside as she leaned down and kissed Agatha. The kiss quickly turned heated. Rio sucked on Agatha’s tongue before breaking away, gasping for air. “You know, I am not a Mile High Club member,” she smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned as she reached for a remote and turned off the lights in the cabin. “I believe we can remedy that.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     As they entered their suite in Peru hours later, Rio entered the bedroom and collapsed on the bed. Jetlagged and exhausted from their in-flight activities. With customs, the flight, a three-hour time difference, and getting checked in, it was nearly midnight, and Rio was ready to sleep for the next twenty-four hours.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you going to change first?” Agatha lay next to her and slung an arm across Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “I took my shoes off, and I’m tired,” Rio muttered back as Agatha’s phone went off, the ringtone indicating it was Jen. “I love her, but it’s midnight, and she knows where we are.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned as she answered, and Jen’s face appeared on the screen. “We could have been naked,” Agatha said in place of a greeting.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing I haven’t seen before. Anyway, is your other half around?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can see her next to me.” Agatha moved the phone more to show Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, the redheaded one.” Jen rolled her eyes as if it were obvious who she meant.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s Valentine’s and her birthday weekend. Nicky’s staying with the twins and Vision. Wanda and Nat won’t surface until we get back, most likely. Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, you’re in Peru without Nat?” Jen looked alarmed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not stupid, Kale. We do have security with us. I know I can’t go anywhere without an armed bodyguard,” Agatha huffed. It was not something she liked about her fame. “Get on with it. Why are you calling me this late at night and looking for Wanda, too?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have had a flurry of phone calls and e-mails, and you’re both about to be very busy women…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m already a busy woman,” Agatha turned her head and grinned at Rio as Jen rolled her eyes again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop acting like a teenage boy and go into global megastar mode, please?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha disgruntedly blew a strand of hair out of her face as Rio suppressed a giggle.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen carried on, “You’ve had requests to present at a few awards shows and accepted them, the Spirit awards, you’re presenting at the Oscars for Supporting Actress, then the SAG, QUEERTIES, GLAAD, and you’re nominated at all of them. That’s for now, though we know there will be the Emmys, possibly the Tonys, and who knows what else.
    </p>
<p>
     Then there’s press for the TV show, all the late-night shows, the morning shows, the talk shows. Everyone wants you, Agatha, and we’re giving you to them. Marvel and Disney are starting table reads, alternating, in May. However, they need you in for some things in April. The show needs some additional filming next month, and it looks like your summer will be packed. Wanda’s too, probably.” Jen finished and looked at Agatha expectantly.
    </p>
<p>
     Both Agatha and Rio were sitting up now. Rio was trying to take everything in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, what about the festival in May? Coachella? Spring Break? Your wedding and reception? Prom? There are some important things we had planned,” Rio looked between the phone and Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put her hand on Rio’s shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     “Welcome to the reality of being me. The past few months were a break period. Now everything is kicking into high gear. I’m sure Jen worked out a few non-negotiables, but some sacrifices will have to be made. Weekends are generally free, most shoots are Monday through Friday, and we can only work five consecutive days a row. Thank you, SAG-Aftra. Spring Break is probably one of those sacrifices, though,” Agatha turned back to the phone to confirm her suspicions.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen was nodding. “I was able to negotiate your music festivals. Coachella was easy. Most celebrities go. Nicky’s junior prom is safe, and our Vegas wedding and the reception are safe. Your Spring Break plans are not. Agatha, you’ll be making the promotion rounds that week.” Jen gave Rio a sad smile, “I’m so sorry. I hate to be the bearer of bad news this weekend, but I had to sync calendars and deliver the news as soon as I could.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I understand, mood killer,” Agatha smirked. “Send me the itinerary for Spring Break, please, once you plan it. Maybe we can salvage something.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They hung up, and Agatha turned to Rio, who was pouting.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wasn’t lying when I said this is one of the reasons I didn’t date before. It’s a lot to ask of someone.” Agatha said softly, trying to gauge where Rio was at with her feelings.
    </p>
<p>
     “I understand it’s your job. I just hate how everything can change so quickly.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, baby. It’s a lot. Let’s enjoy this weekend, and then come with me or stay with Nicky when you can. Please?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was not used to asking someone these things, but it felt right. She liked knowing that Nicky could stay at the house with Rio and loved having Rio by her side.
    </p>
<p>
     “I understand if you can’t come on school nights. Lilia might start saying no to you being out so much,” Agatha did not want to hear what Lilia had to say about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hope you can make it to the playoff games if the team makes it, though even if we lose the rest of the regular season, we should still make it.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Saturday night faded into Sunday morning and they were up extremely early, despite the time change and jet lag. Rio had wanted to do some sightseeing while in Peru and dragged Agatha out to Machu Picchu. Agatha had been before but enjoyed exploring the ruins with Rio and was glad that Alice had been part of the packing team. Alice knew Rio would want to go and had packed the appropriate gear for the hike.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had to guide Rio away from a tarantula they saw amongst some rocks that Rio had wanted to ‘rehome’ back to LA.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s cute, and I want to name her Victoria,” Rio said.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I will buy you a tarantula, my love. Wait, what would Raven do?” Agatha tilted her head, picturing the cat-shaped Eldritch creature training an overgrown furry spider to do her bidding.
    </p>
<p>
     “Probably snuggle with it,” Rio shrugged, waving at the spider and walking back to the main group with Agatha and their security detail.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was imagining her training it to do things for her,”
    </p>
<p>
     “Also a possibility,” Rio agreed.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     After breakfast on Monday morning, they lay in bed discussing the upcoming busy schedule.
    </p>
<p>
     “All of the awards shows are in or around LA, which makes it easy. Talk shows are mainly in LA and New York and mostly over Spring Break. It looks like filming for the show is back in LA, so that makes that easy. Marvel and Disney are between LA and New Jersey, and then this summer, I’ll be in England, Italy, and Australia. It may extend longer. You can come with me over Spring Break if you want to.” Agatha was trying not to sound desperate to spend every moment with Rio and failing.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a possibility, depending on the schedule. I was hoping we could have some fun this summer, not you working the whole time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It doesn’t make sense to bring you along either, especially Marvel. It’s a closed set. If they could cut you off from the entire world until the film was done, they would.” Agatha spoke seriously.
    </p>
<p>
     “So I’ve heard. I can come to visit, though, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ll figure out something. I cannot go for three months without seeing you and Nicky,” she kissed Rio before turning the discussion to upcoming awards shows.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The concert was amazing, Rio honing into her Spanish-speaking childhood. They sat in a box, which was safer for them, even with security. Rio’s hips absolutely did not lie as she danced the entire night and sang to Agatha. Rio rolling her R’s made Agatha feel very indecent things that she planned on capitalizing on when they returned to the hotel.
    </p>
<p>
     Keeping to her word, Agatha had indeed made a few requests for the setlist as several older songs were played, and Shakira mentioned singing them for ‘a friend’, winking in the direction of their box.
    </p>
<p>
     They flew back early the next day so they could recover on Wednesday before Rio had to go back to teacher mode. They mostly slept on the plane and looked through the pictures they took and a few that popped up online.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m still getting used to people posting pictures of me online. It’s so weird. People will post ‘Rio Vidal sightings’ now.” Rio mused.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is your life now,” Agatha looked at her. “As long as you want it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s breath caught for a millisecond. What did Agatha mean when she said those things? Did she just want to date forever? Get married? Live together? Would she be okay if Rio ended things? Was she waiting for Rio to end things? Agatha was not the most forthcoming when it came to commitment, although Rio was the one they had waited on in that department. She would drop it for now and focus on other things.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They had left Rio’s car in the lot near the private hangar at the airport. Security escorted them until they sat in the car, Agatha climbing in the passenger seat after opening Rio’s door when she pointed at something.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, what’s that?” Agatha pointed at a letter on the dashboard that was addressed to Rio in Lou’s handwriting.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio froze for a few beats before reaching out and calmly taking the letter. “It’s from Lou,” She said, her voice cold. “I thought she was still in prison?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed, her head falling against the headrest. “I swear this bitch has nine lives. Her lawyers must have gotten her out on house arrest or something. We will need to tell Nat. Do you want to open it or wait until you’re alone?” Agatha wanted Rio to share with her, but it was for Rio, and she wouldn’t force her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallowed hard as she carefully opened the letter.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “My Dearest Rio,
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The night Agatha confessed to you, she knew I had documents proving the near marriage and her first pregnancy. Did she tell you because she wanted to or because she wanted to beat me to it? Can you trust her to tell you the truth without being forced?
    </p>
<p>
     What else is she still keeping from you? Other than her ex’s identity?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     You will always be mine,
    </p>
<p>
     I love you. No more secrets.
    </p>
<p>
     Lou."
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t know how to feel. She just slouched in her seat and leaned her head back, clutching the letter. She let out an exasperated sigh, not even turning to look at Agatha. “Speak.” She commanded in a tired tone.
    </p>
<p>
     “I had felt guilty for not telling you ever since that initial discussion. When Nat told me Lou had Lorna’s documents, I knew which ones they were. I knew I had to tell you, and then I discovered the secret about the photo album. I knew after then that it was no longer that I felt forced to tell you, but I wanted to. I wanted, I want, to be honest about everything. I haven’t told you who Swords is because I don’t want our sordid past to cloud your judgment of her if your paths cross, just like I said. She’s a different person now, and I do interact with her occasionally,” Agatha reached out to take Rio’s hand, only for Rio to pull away in the small confines of the car.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha winced. “Baby, please. Look at me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned her head to look at Agatha, hurt in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want me to say, Agatha? My psychotic ex tells me in a letter that you bared your soul after you found out she knew your dark secrets. You wouldn’t tell me you loved me until then. I somewhat understand why your ex is still a mystery.” Rio sighed. She did that too much lately. “Let’s just go back to the compound.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They drove in silence. It was early evening with the time difference, they noticed Alice’s car parked outside Agatha’s house.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did Alice or Jen mention coming over?” Rio’s voice was hoarse from silently crying.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha grabbed for the luggage.
    </p>
<p>
     “Leave mine, I’m going home tonight,” Rio said softly before walking toward the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a deep breath and put on a smile for her friends as she walked through the door, noticing that Rio had done the same.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, what are you two doing here?” Agatha asked as she took her suitcase straight to the laundry room to deal with later.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda told us to meet here. She had us pick up dinner,” Alice answered, pointing at food containers in the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here!” Nicky called as he and the twins walked through the door. “Practice went fine, Rio, I think we have a great shot at state,” He grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     “We have to get there first.” Rio hugged him.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “We’re here!” Wanda shouted as she and Nat came in the door and through to the living room, both glowing. They had laid low since Friday, waiting to gather everyone together.
    </p>
<p>
     “Great, would you like to tell me why everyone is gathered at my house?” Agatha joked. She had a pretty good idea of what they were about to say.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda and Nat looked at each other, excitement and pure joy radiating from them.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re getting married!” The redheads exclaimed at the same time, holding up their left hands.
    </p>
<p>
     There were hugs, congratulations, and cheers. Rio was excited and happy for them. Of course, she was. They had waited for this for so long, and they deserved it. She and Agatha hadn’t been together long enough to discuss it, so why did she feel hollow?
     <em>
      Because it’s all vague, and you don’t know if she’s still holding anything back.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Alice whispered in her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? Yeah! I’m fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Liar. I know you better than anyone. Something’s wrong,” Alice kept her voice low, eyes darting to Agatha. “What did she do?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She knew Lou had your mom’s stuff. It’s why she told me everything. Lou left a letter in my car,” Rio’s voice was low as she tried not to look suspicious. “What else is she hiding, Alice?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is Agatha. She plays her cards close to her chest. It’s how she’s always had to do things, Ri.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are you taking her side?” Rio was quickly starting to lose trust in everyone.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not. What did she say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That she didn’t tell me because she knew psycho had the information, but because she wants to be honest with me.” Rio echoed what Agatha had said earlier.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then there’s your answer. She loves you, Rio. Don’t do this thing where you get scared and push her away because you overthink it because I know that’s what you’re doing.” Alice glared. It was a habit Rio had.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am not.” Rio looked away, knowing that was what she was doing. “I do think I’m going to sneak out and recover from the weekend, though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re as subtle as a heart attack, you idiot.” Alice muttered, “Go, I’ll cover you.” Alice made her way back to the main group, gushing over the rings and trying to draw attention away from Rio as she left.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes followed Rio as she left. “What’s going on with her?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice sighed, “She’s trying to run because she’s an insecure idiot who thinks she needs to have a five-year plan three months into a relationship.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So, a lesbian then?” Nicky quipped from the table, mouthful of chicken alfredo.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, like you’re one to talk. I saw you and Morgan discussing which colleges to go to,” Tommy shoved his shoulder as Nicky choked on a noodle.
    </p>
<p>
     “No choking!” Wanda called, making sure no one was actually choking before looking back at Agatha, “I know the two of you have moved quickly, but have you vocalized what direction you’re going in? Other than a vague forever?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Forever is vague?” Agatha quirked an eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
     “That woman is going to break up with you.” Jen used her fork to gesture at Agatha. “And it will be your fault.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I thought when you told someone you wanted to be with them for ‘as long as they wanted you’ and ‘forever’ and all that, it meant, well, forever!” Agatha said, frustrated, and turned to Wanda and Nat. “It worked for you two!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Only because I was married,” Wanda said dryly.
    </p>
<p>
     “If Rio didn’t believe in or want a marriage, that would be one thing. But she does. Have you talked about moving in together? Or a timeline? A timeline for getting married? Anything?” Alice questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, why would we? We just started dating.” Agatha did not understand women.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a collective groan.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha honey,” Wanda started again, “let me put it this way, do you love Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Madly.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want to live with Rio?” Wanda continued.
    </p>
<p>
     “Absolutely.”
    </p>
<p>
     “When do you see that happening?” Nat jumped in, trying to help draw more out of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Within a few months, I planned on asking her when her lease came up,” Agatha answered honestly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, great! Do you want to marry her?” Alice took over the next question.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chewed on her bottom lip, “I’m not the marrying type,” She went back to her safe answer.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda waved her hand dismissively. “That’s a bullshit protective answer, and we all know it. Try again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “IF I were to get married, it would be her. I do want her to remain in my life romantically.” Agatha affirmed after thinking about it.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen reached out and put a hand on Jen’s knee. “Then go tell her that. Come on, we’ll give you a ride, and we have a cheesy idea for how to get her to let you in.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     After they finished eating and Agatha packed food for Rio and Raven, she knew better than to leave out the cat, she was headed back to Rio’s with Alice and Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re sure this will work?” Agatha asked skeptically.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice grinned, “Oh, absolutely. If nothing else, Jen will get some great pictures.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate you both.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had decided against using her key to get into Rio’s. She knew Rio was mad at her. She knocked instead, not surprised when she heard Rio tell her to go away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, baby? I want to talk.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio called back.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio listened for any reply and didn’t hear one. She turned from the door and stopped when she heard music, followed by the undeniable voice of Agatha Fucking Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have learned the lesson of all that’s foul and fair. Our love was forged in fire, water, earth, and air…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn’t sure if she should laugh or cry. She was getting her very own
     <em>
      Say Anything
     </em>
     moment, except instead of a teenage boy, it was a fifty-one-year-old mega star in the hall of her apartment building.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned around and walked to the door, Agatha still singing.
    </p>
<p>
     “...and so I dare, to risk this heart of mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened the door to see Agatha holding her phone over her head in the classic John Cusack pose, and Rio couldn’t help but laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “That smile makes this worth it,” Agatha surged forward, pocketed her phone, kissed Rio heatedly, and closed the door behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t run from me, from us, from this, okay?” Agatha gasped, peppering Rio’s face with kisses, hands running through her hair. “I’m sorry that I’m not the best at this. I do want you. I don’t know what our future holds, okay? I don’t know what the five-year plan is. I know I want you to move in with me when your lease is up. I know I want you by my side. I know that we’ve moved really fucking fast, and it terrifies me. I know there are things I still need to tell you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put her fingers to Agatha’s lips and looked at her. “Aggie, breathe.” Rio led her to sit down. “We don’t have to plan all of this out right now. I don’t want to force you to do anything you’re not ready for, just, I was led on for so long with a potential psycho killer, and I can’t do that again.” Rio looked down, eyes filled with sad and painful memories.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put her hand on Rio’s cheek and turned Rio’s face to look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not forcing me. I’m just bad at communicating without a script. I love you, and the moving-in thing was something I had already planned. I will start telling you about these things when I think of them, okay? I really don’t know where I am on the marriage thing. If I were to get married, it would be to you. If I were to have more children, it would be with you. If I were to have a dog, or buy another house, or own another business, it would all be with you, Rio. I fucking love you. Please don’t run or overthink it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned forward and kissed her tenderly, trying to convey her point. Rio leaned into the kiss, placing her hand on Agatha’s chest. She pulled back slightly, looking at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “That helped. I will try to keep the overthinking to a minimum and stop comparing this to my extremely unhealthy last relationship. Now, what do you still need to tell me? No more secrets. That’s what got us in this damn mess.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is, but it’s late. Can we at least change and get in bed?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who said you were staying over?” Rio feined offense.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, I’ll just go home.” Agatha stood.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever. You have clothes in my room, and Raven is asleep on your side of the bed.” Rio stood and walked towards the bedroom, turning off the lights. “You can put the food you packed for me in the fridge, please!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared after Rio, trying to decide if that was an invitation or a dare. Possibly a threat. She had brought a bag in with food after all, though it seemed like Rio had either eaten or wasn’t hungry. She turned toward the kitchen and put the food away, going over the day’s events. She was so incredibly excited for Wanda, and still a little confused over Rio. Where had all of that really come from? Had the letter from Lou caused that? As soon as she thought it, her eyes fell on the letter as she passed back through the living room. The lights were off, but she could tell it was the same letter. She picked it up and used her phone as a flashlight to read over it. Rio had read it in the car, but Agatha hadn’t seen it. She opened it now to see that there was more writing than what Rio had read.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I have done some thinking. I want to marry you, now.
    </p>
<p>
     You’re not getting any younger. Let’s have a baby.
    </p>
<p>
     I’m 55 and I still want kids.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      That fucking psychotic bitch.
     </em>
     There was even a phone number. She took a screenshot of the letter and sent it to Nat before folding it back up the way she found it and going into the bedroom. Rio was already in bed and waiting for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Made your decision?” Rio looked at her expectantly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha handed Rio the letter and put her bag on the dresser, looking for her pajamas. “I did bring a bag and all.”
    </p>
<p>
     She took out her pajamas and began to change.
    </p>
<p>
     “What I need to tell you is that when I decided to marry Swords, I was going to give it all up: my career, the fame, everything. I was only 33 then, so you can imagine what I would have missed. So I really dodged a bullet when she didn’t show,” Agatha lifted her hair from her pajama shirt and walked toward the bathroom to brush her teeth while Rio watched her, shocked. “Offering to give it all up was the only way I could get her to agree to marry me, pregnant or not. I think the seriousness of it all scared her. She claimed she couldn’t let me throw away everything I built,” Agatha began brushing her teeth while Rio processed it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can see why you left that part out since it didn’t happen, but damn Agatha. That’s big. I’m glad you didn’t get married. I mean, obviously, but also because of everything you wouldn’t have done. I’m not even mad at that admission. Oh, early, what businesses do you own?” Rio had thought about it, but she didn’t remember Agatha owning a business.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, the club in New York? That’s mine. I own a few other side things here and there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait. The secret lesbian club? You own that? Not Andi?” Rio wasn’t sure how to feel.
    </p>
<p>
     “Since I was eighteen. I didn’t want people to think I was curating my own selection of women or trying to get free drinks. A place like that was needed, so I created it.” Agatha scooted in next to Rio and kissed her with minty, fresh breath. “Mad?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio considered everything before looking over at Agatha. “No, baby girl, I’m not.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snorted. “Did you call me baby girl? I am…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cut her off, “I don’t care how old you are. You are wearing bunny rabbit pajama bottoms, your hair is in a braid, and you stood at my door reliving a scene from a brat pack movie after chasing after me. You are very much baby girl right now,” Rio laughed and kissed her on the forehead.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m head over heels in love with you is what I am,” Agatha grinned before remembering the letter. “Why didn’t you tell me everything that was in that letter?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio made a disgusted sound, “Because she was trying to get in my head, and I knew you would want to charge off and commit murder.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, it worked. She did get in your head, and what’s wrong with a little murder between mortal enemies?” Agatha shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you’re mortal enemies now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Obviously. She’s trying to use your insecurity against you and trick you into marrying her and then babytrap you!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, that is what she was doing!” Rio had been so caught up in her feelings she hadn’t realized the obvious. “Okay, no, you can end her now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s about time I had your blessing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You already sent Nat that phone number, didn’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t answer. Instead, she grinned, straddled Rio, and kissed her.
    </p>

     The rest of February went by with a flurry of awards shows and basketball games. Playoffs began, and SHIELD was the team to beat, and
     <em>
      Death’s Beloved
     </em>
     was sweeping everything. Yet again, the coven was on top. Plans for the reception after Spring Break were being solidified, the plans for the wedding itself were solidified, and Spring Break plans had been made. Wanda and Nat had announced their engagement by showing up on a red carpet with rings on their hands, and social media had lost it. Wanda confirmed it later with a well-received post.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Now they were at the Oscars. It had already been a wonderful night. Agatha had performed her song and won the Oscar for it. They were waiting for the last two Oscars of the night; Best Actress, and Best Film. They were honestly all hoping for Wanda to win best actress, as Agatha and Wanda held hands while they went through nominees, Agatha turned to Wanda. “You earned this one angel. If you don’t win this one, I’m going to lose my shit,”
    </p>
<p>
     “The Oscar goes to…AGATHA HARKNESS!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck that,” Agatha said, as she hugged and kissed Rio and whispered, “Please still love me in a few minutes.”
    </p>
<p>
     She turned and grabbed Wanda’s wrist. “Let’s go, superstar,” and pulled her to the stage with her. Agatha wasn’t at all surprised that their friends were cheering and clapping. Never underestimate Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     They reached the stage, Agatha in a dark purple gown, Wanda in a scarlet one, trying to keep on a smile and not a smirk. Agatha graciously took the golden statue and went to the microphone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey everyone, as you can see, I brought the person that actually deserves this award with me.” Several people cheered, “Well, tell me what you really think. Anyway, this movie would not be as amazing or powerful as it is without this amazing woman standing next to me. The only reason I won and not her is because too many of you took her personal life into account when you voted, and that’s not fucking right.” The music began to play, and Agatha looked straight at the sound booth, “Cut the music now Ralph, before I call your wife.” It stopped automatically, and she continued. “Anyway, you’re voting based on our on-screen performances, not our off-screen performances. Wanda decided to live her truth this year, and you cannot punish her for that by robbing her of a much-deserved award, you cowards. So, Wanda, this is yours.” She stepped back and handed Wanda the award with a hug.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda stepped to the mic and looked around. “With as long as I’ve been doing this, I’m not sure this is allowed…”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s Agatha Fucking Harkness, she’s allowed!” Tony yelled from the audience to several people agreeing.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda looked over to Conan, who was hosting the show, as he just shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, so, thank you to my amazing and wonderful fiancèe, Nat, my family and friends, Agatha for being…Agatha, everyone who worked on the film, and Agatha, I swear if the Academy strips both of us of this and whatever else, I’m never having fake sex with you in a movie again.” Wanda smiled as Agatha smirked, and the crowd laughed. It didn’t matter where they were. They, they made everyone around them feel like it was a small gathering of friends. Wanda waved as they walked off stage, and Conan sent it to a commercial break before the final award since Wanda and Agatha had to get back to their seats as they were the favorites for the final category.
    </p>
<p>
     One of the members of the board for the Academy came rushing over to them, “Ms. Harkness, you can’t just…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha held her hand up, “Who had the second most votes?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, Wanda…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay then, I refuse my Oscar. Give it to second place.” Agatha said resolutely and walked back to her seat, the board member stuttering and stammering behind her, Wanda cackling.
    </p>

     won Best Picture, the press wanting to speak with Agatha as she ignored them, taking Rio’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come dance with me at a few after-parties, please, my love?” She asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course! I do love a Hollywood rebel.”

     It was the state championship game, and Rio was nervous. SHIELD was hosting as the home team, and the stands were packed. She looked at her players. They were truly
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     team now, even though Coach Carter was in the stands watching and had come and talked with them. Peggy told her she was thinking about staying home with the baby next year and that Rio should take over the team if she did. The possibility was an exciting one, but right now, Rio was focused on the game ahead of them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alright, minions, listen up, you guys are amazing, and I love all of you nerds. The girls over there? Yeah, their coach doesn’t love them, and they aren’t as cool as you guys are.”
    </p>
<p>
     The team laughed and rolled their eyes. Rio always did this at the beginning of a game, saying random things to calm their nerves and make them laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, seriously though, I am so forking proud of all of you. You have done an amazing job this season, and I am so thankful that you guys let me just come in and take over. Now, when we win, no dumping Gatorade on my head. This isn’t football. We pop champ…sparkling cider bottles over at Morgan’s house like the ladies we are, got it?” Several of the girls giggled. The plan was that if they won, there would be a party at the Stark’s house. Even if they lost, Tony would still host a party. “Just play your best, okay? That’s all I ask.”
    </p>
<p>
     The game started and SHIELD was losing quickly. Rio grimaced. At least they made it this far. She, Nicky, and now Coach Johnson, now that she was back, gave their all from the sidelines. They finally started picking up speed, and by halftime, they were only down by six.
    </p>
<p>
     “Great job, my minions, I’m so proud of you! Keep it up, draw those fouls, and get some of those girls ejected. Throw elbows if you have to. Play dirty!” Rio was fired up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Go for the knees!” Agatha said behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, wrong sport,” Nicky reminded her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not if you make it look accidental,” Agatha shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     “No one listen to her,” Rio instructed as several girls snickered. They were used to Agatha from growing up with Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to look at Agatha with her jersey on and gave her a quick peck on the cheek. “You can’t be down here. Go before we get in trouble.” Rio poked her in the side
    </p>
<p>
     “I came to give you a good luck kiss and wish the team luck, good luck youngins!” She winked and gave Rio a chaste kiss. “Besides, I’m Agatha Harkness, and I do what I want. You look really sexy in a suit, and I couldn’t stay away any longer, but the ref keeps giving me side eye, so I’m going now.” Agatha sauntered back to her seat with the rest of the coven, and Rio rolled her eyes, turning back to the team with very red cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     Kamala Khan had asked Morgan something that Rio didn’t hear, only Morgan’s response of “Oh, you can ask Nicky too. They are always like this.”
    </p>
<p>
     The game resumed, and SHIELD was back. They tied it up and got ahead quickly, then the other team was ahead, then they were ahead, it was close, and it came down to the last few seconds. Morgan made the shot from the three-point line, a shot she usually wasn’t good at for her height. Rio watched through her fingers. Agatha watched through her fingers. It went around the rim and through the net just as the buzzer went off. 72-71 SHIELD.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t believe it. If Morgan tried that shot again, she probably wouldn’t have made it, but right now, she had. Everyone was cheering, running, jumping, and doing the most. Agatha spun her around and threw her arms around her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Earth to Rio! Your girls won! You did it!” Agatha exclaimed, buzzing with energy. “I am so proud of you, baby!”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t believe it! We won! We did it! Oh shit! We’ve gotta do the lineup and handshake thing.” Rio was scrambling and nervous about interacting with the other coach. The other team had matched them the entire time. Rio knew they would.
    </p>
<p>
     It was Rio’s old team.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s previous assistant coach.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s plays.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blew her whistle and had the girls meet at halfcourt for the customary high fives and good games. Rio saw the questioning looks on the faces of the other girls. None of them knew what had happened, just that one day, Rio was gone.
    </p>
<p>
     Parents were gathered on the court and had stepped aside as the girls went through the line, yet none of them would high-five or shake hands with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was finally face-to-face with the other coach. “Mindy, I see you erased the sportsmanship I taught the girls.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You left, and they lost in the first round last year because of it,” Mindy replied coldly.
    </p>
<p>
     “I left because I had been stalked and attacked, and therefore was placed on admin leave.” Rio attempted to explain. “You would know that if you had been a real friend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever, you knew our plays. Your team cheated.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re MY plays, Mindy. It’s not cheating when I was the one who wrote the entire playbook.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why don’t we ask the official?” Mindy was right in her face as Nat appeared at Rio’s side.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ri, is there a problem?” Nat asked, sizing up the other woman.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gritted her teeth, “Grab the official, will you Nat? I have a question.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nat raised an eyebrow but went to get the official. All eyes were on the two coaches at this point, wondering who would throw the first punch. Lilia and Wanda each had Agatha by an arm, holding her back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha Harkness having her bodyguard keeping an eye on you now? Is she worried someone’s going to harm her plaything?” Mindy teased.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are you such a bitch, Mindy? I never did anything to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “YOU didn’t, but you had what I wanted, and you threw her away.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wanted to scream. She turned as Nat came back with the official. Mindy opened her mouth, and Rio put up her hand and explained, in a nutshell, the issue.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, ma’am, did we cheat?”
    </p>
<p>
     The official shook her head. “No, we knew you were the former coach. The win is legitimate.” She looked at Mindy. “Your team needs to vacate now. We will send the second-place trophy to the school.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had wrangled her way out of Wanda and Lilia’s grip, finally and joined them, glaring at Mindy as she slinked away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I add her to Nat’s list?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes.” Rio turned to Agatha, “We can celebrate now.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The celebrations resumed, and Nicky lifted Morgan so she could cut down the net. When he lowered her back to the ground, she looked up at him questioningly.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not mad or jealous?” Morgan asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky laughed, “No, why would I be?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, the football team lost in playoffs, and we just won state…”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky put his hand up, “Wait. You were at the Oscars last Sunday, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, we sat next to each other.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just making sure, and you saw Agatha Harkness give the metaphorical finger to the Academy, refuse her Oscar, and give it to my Aunt because she deserves it more, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     Morgan wasn’t following, “Of course I did, Nicky, but what does that have to do…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m getting there, but you know that’s my mom and my aunt, and they raised me, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, yes, but…oh.” It hit her. Nicky didn’t have a jealous bone in his body. If someone worked hard for something and deserved it, they deserved it, and he would support them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicholas Harkness, you are the most well-rounded and well-adjusted 16-year-old boy to exist. I love you.” She stood on her tiptoes and kissed him.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     “My mom had me do a lot of therapy early on to make sure I’d be like this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s a smart woman. Now stop kissing my daughter,” Tony said, walking up to them as Pepper rolled her eyes. “We have a party at the house to get to.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Tommy jogged up to Cassie, “Hey, are you going to the party? I know you didn’t play or even dress out, but uh, good job?” He offered as she laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re such an idiot, Tommy. Yes, I’m going, are you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean, if you are…” Tommy ran a hand through his hair.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen groaned. “This kid is painful,” She said to Wanda, who nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda looked at them, “We’ll give you a ride, Cassie, come on.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio watched as everyone dispersed, most people headed towards Tony’s. She looked at Agatha, “I should make an appearance, huh?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You did coach them to victory,” Agatha offered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, fine, but just a few minutes, then take me home.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>

     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It was finally time, Vegas weekend. Wedding weekend.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice wore an ecru tux with an orange vest and heels. Her black and red hair was in big, loose curls. They were getting married in a chapel her mother had frequented. It was cliche and a bit cheesy, but very ‘Wu’.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re beautiful,” Rio gushed, eyes full of tears.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t cry, you’ll ruin your makeup,” Alice scolded, knowing that if Rio cried, she would too.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was wearing a simple orange spaghetti-strap dress with heels and had a bouquet of pink roses. “No promises once the ceremony starts, okay? I just wish…” She trailed off.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know. I wish they were here too.” Alice finished. She knew Rio was thinking of Lorna and Gran but was trying to spare them tears.
    </p>
<p>
     They turned when they heard Wanda come into the small room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you’re both beautiful.” Wanda fanned her eyes so she wouldn’t cry. “Alice, let’s get you married.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice stood at the altar. Vision was officiating; they were just using the chapel. Nat, Wanda, and the boys sat in chairs in the audience.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha waited just outside of the chapel with Jen. Agatha wore a black suit with a pink bowtie and matching vest. Her chestnut hair was down in long waves, a pink rose in her chest pocket, and pink stilettos completing the outfit.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen wore a strapless, tea-length ivory dress that flared out at the waist with a petticoat underneath. It had a pink sash around the middle, and she wore a pink knitted bolero, pink heels, and carried pink roses that matched Rio’s. Her hair had grown out since the fall, and she wore her natural curls close to her scalp with a simple strand of pearls.
    </p>
<p>
     She wore Gran’s engagement ring, a white gold band with three pink gemstones in the middle.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart stopped when Rio approached. She was beautiful. The orange perfectly complimented her skin, and Agatha couldn’t help but picture what Rio would wear to Wanda’s wedding or potentially their own one day.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow,” Was all Agatha could say as she kissed Rio, careful not to smudge her makeup.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, yourself,” Rio parroted before turning to Jen. “You look absolutely radiant. I am so happy for you. But if you hurt her, whatever Nat is capable of will seem like child’s play.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen gulped, taking Rio seriously, “I don’t know if I’m afraid or if I want your number…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha narrowed her eyes at Jen as she heard the music start from inside.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s our cue. My love?” She held out her arm for Rio as they went inside and headed down the aisle to their places.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen followed, and Alice’s lips parted in a delighted sigh. Jen did the same when she saw Alice. Rio thought they looked perfect for each other because they were perfect for each other.
    </p>
<p>
     The ceremony began, and the time to exchange vows came. They had each prepared their own, and Alice shifted nervously as she started.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to try and get through this without crying, and I usually don’t cry,” she laughed shakily, seeing only Jen in front of her. “Jennifer, you were one of my first friends in LA when Agatha and Wanda pulled me in, and you saw me for more than Lorna Wu’s daughter and Agatha’s goddaughter.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been listening intently and was shocked at that small revelation as she caught Agatha’s eye and exchanged glances with her. They would discuss that small tidbit later, but that explained why she talked to Alice at Lorna’s funeral. Rio had kept listening while in her own thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     “We quickly became friends and walked that very thin line for far too long. The classic tale of falling in love with one of your best friends and not wanting to lose that. When we finally went on that first date last fall, it was like someone threw gas on a smoldering fire. We couldn’t go fast enough, though
     <em>
      some people
     </em>
     will say we took too long, myself being one of them. We’re finally here, and that’s what matters. While part of me feels like we’re making up for lost time, I know we spent most of that time together in some capacity. We fell in love over a decade ago, and it took us that long to figure it out. Hanging out at the compound, parties, texting during awards shows, so many little things brought us here to this moment, and I am grateful for them all.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice swiped a tear away from her cheek as Rio handed her Kleenex, and Agatha did the same for Jen. Alice took Jen’s hand in hers and continued.
    </p>
<p>
     “I vow to love you fiercely, to always ask your expertise when creating lesson plans, to be your hiking partner, and to listen to you rant about certain people in this room.”
    </p>
<p>
     They both grinned and looked at Agatha after the last one, who just shrugged before turning back to the moment at hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “Most importantly, I vow to be your rock, the person you come home to, the one you can lean on for the rest of our lives and whatever comes after that.” Alice wiped a tear from Jen’s cheek with her thumb.
    </p>
<p>
     “How am I supposed to follow that?” Jen took a breath, steadying herself. “Alice. You came into my life at a personal turning point in so many ways. I was proving myself in my career and my identity. I was thirty and having a crisis. The first major interaction we had, I was ranting about a major scandal I was having to fix because of your fairy gaymother back there, and you made me dinner, helped me work through it, and then picked my brain for historical accuracy for something. You’ve always been able to calm my inner rage in a way no one else has. I was so afraid of losing that that I denied my feelings for so long. When you called hours after I told you I just wanted to be friends, I was so thankful that you saw through it, like you always do. It does seem like we ran with things when, in reality, it was painfully slow. I can’t imagine doing life without you. I vow to drive you insane with my skincare routine, to love you intensely, to always be by your side, and to never intentionally cause you pain.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rings were exchanged, a pronouncement was made, and Alice and Jen were officially married. There was not a dry eye in the place.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They had a small dinner afterward to celebrate before everyone went their separate ways and began their Spring Break plans. The newlyweds were off to somewhere tropical for a few days before being back in LA for the reception. Vision and the twins were going to hike in the Grand Canyon for a few days. Nat and Wanda had plans to hustle a few poker tables for sport, and Billy went back to his room to talk to Morgan. He was going skiing with the Starks for a few days, and they were making plans for the trip. The boy was exactly like his mother when it came to love.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio and Agatha sat in a private VIP area at The Wynn, overlooking the activity and watching two redheads win hand after hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda Maximoff, gambler and bookie. Who knew?” Rio observed as Agatha sipped champagne. “Speaking of surprising things, godmother?” Rio turned to look at the woman next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice didn’t want to make a big deal of it, and it was her secret to tell, not mine,” Agatha waved it off.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s fair. Is that what you told her at Lorna’s funeral?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Part of it, again, this is a discussion you need to have with Alice. What I can tell you is that when Lorna had Alice, she asked me to be the godmother more as a formality. However, she did want Alice to have a choice between Norma and myself. So when Lorna died, I gave her that envelope with Lorna’s journal and documents. I knew some of what was in there, not what’s written in the journal, other than it’s for Alice if she ever reads it.” Agatha turned to Rio. “For everything else, you really do need to talk to Alice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio accepted that. She knew Lorna and Agatha had been close and that there were things about that particular history that she would never know.
    </p>
<p>
     “Will do. Now, we have a busy week ahead of us and an early flight to New York tomorrow. I say we leave the red-headed demons to their hustle and, um, turn in for the night, my love.” Rio placed her empty champagne flute on a nearby table and took Agatha’s hand, leading her to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh? Tired already?” Agatha placed her glass down and followed Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Something like that.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ⭐⭐⭐
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Spring Break felt like a movie montage. The first few days were spent in New York, and the second half was spent in LA, leading up to Alice and Jen’s reception. Wanda and Nat had come with them so Nat could do bodyguard duty, and Wanda was on some of the press as well, with the awards' success. Rio loved watching Agatha do interviews and talk about her projects; how animated she was speaking about her work, facial expressions, and reactions. Agatha was so dedicated to what she did, and it showed in interviews. Everyone she spoke with would ask Agatha about Rio and Nicky, and she would gush about Nicky and try to be close-lipped about Rio but blush and say things were good and she was happy.
    </p>
<p>
     They went to Buzzfeed, where Wanda and Agatha both filmed a segment for ‘Thirst Tweets,’ which was full of laughter and was highly inappropriate. Rio and Nat were both mentioned in several of them and could be heard from behind the camera.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They flew back to LA for more press as everyone else started to return and prepare for the reception on Saturday. Lou’s trial was also that week, and everyone watched it closely. They expected her to plead insanity and get it. The sentencing is what they were the most concerned with, and how to keep her wherever she was sent to. That was the hard part.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat in front of the TV at Agatha’s, waiting for the final word when everyone else came back from whatever show they had been filming for.
    </p>
<p>
     “Any word yet?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just shook her head, eyes glued to the TV as Jen’s phone rang and the special report cut off.
    </p>
<p>
     All eyes turned to Jen as she hung up the phone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Before sentencing occurs, Lou is requesting to speak to you privately at the courthouse. She says she has information you’ll want, and some things that belong to you, specifically those videos. Lawyers will meet us there.” Jen turned on her heel and walked back out.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio sat in the judge’s chambers across a table from Lou. Everyone else was outside and pissed about it—no recording devices, just the two of them, as Rio glared at her.
    </p>
<p>
     Lou inhaled sharply, “Where do you want me to go, Rio?” She asked sincerely.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her cautiously. “What are you playing at?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lou let out a shrill laugh. “I want you more than anything, and I love you more than anything. Yet here I am. The past finally caught up to me. Oh, we’re not over, not in the least. I’ll get out, and I’ll get you back. I still have eyes and ears on you and Agatha. However, it’s not looking great at this moment. Lawyers say if I can get a good character witness, I might not be sent to the Island.”
    </p>
<p>
     A sarcastic smile slid across Rio’s face before she started laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you fucking kidding me? You’re asking me to put in a good word for you? You’re unbelievable! No one gets out of The Island. It’s the most secure psych institution in the world; people disappear from there, never to be seen again, Lou, and I sincerely hope you’re one of them. How the fuck do you still have eyes and ears on us?” That tidbit just hit Rio as she backtracked.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are obsessed with knowing what your precious cat is doing all the fucking time,” Lou let out an exasperated sigh. “I just laid it all out for you, and you’re still going to let them put me away, possibly never to see me again?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate you, and I don’t hate anyone! You made me despise you! You made me genuinely afraid for my life! You tried to hurt my son, Lou! I can’t trust you. You want to know where I want you? In a fucking grave! It’s the only way to know I and everyone I love is safe! Alice and Jen got married, and I was nervous you would find a way to ruin their day! You tried to win me back with empty promises of a baby, that’s a whole new level of fucked up, even for you! No, I will not be a character witness. Wait, is that the information you had? How you were still listening in? Through the pet cameras?” Rio was livid.
    </p>
<p>
     “It got you down here, didn’t it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio slammed her hands on the table, causing Lou to jump. “Where are these belongings? Videos? Whatever the fuck else you have?”

<p>
     “House, in the safe. You need me…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I don’t. You’re predictable, and I know all your codes.” Rio stood and walked toward the door. “I don’t want to see your face again, Lou Falco. I feel so bad for Shane’s kids and pray they have a wonderful therapist. I hope you rot and are never heard from again. I was in love with you once, but I’m not now. When I do get married and potentially have a baby, it will be with Agatha.” With that, Rio left the room, Lou screaming behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Nat as she walked past her, “I assume you got all that somehow, and we’re disabling Raven’s cameras and sending a team to Lou’s?”
    </p>
<p>
     Nat nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good.” Rio took Agatha’s hand as they walked out a side door where they had come in unseen. “I have a feeling she’ll disappear in a few days and won’t be heard from again.”

     Alice and Jen couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful reception. Their friends had outdone themselves, and everything was going amazingly well. They had repeated their vows for everyone and were mingling, staying together, and accepting congratulations from co-workers, friends, and acquaintances.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched as everyone enjoyed themselves. The past few days had happened in a whirlwind, and she had to work in less than forty-eight hours. She watched as Wanda and Nat whispered to each other, discussing their future wedding most likely. The boys and their dates were dancing and laughing, and Agatha was talking animatedly with the Starks, among others, when she looked back at Rio and winked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s mind wandered, taking in the expanse of celebrities and people now a part of her daily life. Everyone seemed to be here. Suddenly, she couldn’t help but think about how Agatha had mentioned that Swords was still in her life. Was Swords here? At Alice’s reception? It bothered Rio that Swords might be someone who would be at big events like this, and she didn’t know it. She looked around, surveying the room for older Hollywood women.  That’s when Rio heard a familiar voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “...you know, I helped Cher write Believe.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      No.
     </em>
     The world stopped in the worst of ways, everything happening in slow motion. The voice floated to Rio’s ears again.
    </p>
<p>
     “C’mon kid, the song isn’t THAT old.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Is that where Agatha got the ‘kid’ habit from?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Swords wasn’t a Hollywood powerhouse. No, she was the mysterious figure in the shadows, a keeper of secrets. Not famous, but infamous.
    </p>
<p>
     Puzzle pieces started to fall in place. The older woman, the caring mentor.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned her head, eyes landing on the owner of the voice, knowing full well the owner’s identity but not wanting to admit it to herself as the full weight of it hit her like a punch to the chest, shattering her heart, and sucking all the air from the room.
    </p>
<p>
     The Calderu knows best attitude, arrogance, and entitlement.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia was Agatha’s ex.

<em>
<span>
       “Mom! Why can’t I just go to school normally like other kids? Instead of being tutored and doing everything from a distance? There’s that school for kids of celebrities and the rich that’s right here. I could socialize and be out of your hair.” Fourteen-year-old Agatha Harkness asked her mother. She spent all of her time either under Evanora’s very controlling thumb or on a set. She had her ways of rebelling and doing what she wanted, but more freedom was something she craved. She had gone through tutors and homeschool programs, and if her mother would let her, she could test out of high school and probably a few degree programs. She could speak multiple languages, code those new computers, and run all the movie equipment…what else was a bored child star supposed to do with her spare time? She broke laws, learned, and had a lot of mature fun with her costars.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Her mother wanted her to waste her talents on bible studies and high school work.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You have been learning things above your station, Agatha. You will also spend more time in your religious studies. I only allow you to continue this devil’s work because it is good money for your future.” Evanora replied in her normal, harsh voice.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Ha. You mean for you.” Agatha responded and received a slap across the face. It was a wonder she didn’t have a constant bruise on her left cheek.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You will not smart back to me!”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It was then that there was a knock on the door. Evanora looked at Agatha severely. Agatha couldn’t remember a time when there was love in her mother’s eyes.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “That school you so desperately wanted to attend sends teachers for distance students. No need to physically go to the school. Ms. Calderu will be your teacher for the rest of your high school years. You will be respectful. Now, I have errands to run.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Evanora opened the door of the trailer, welcomed Ms. Calderu in, and introduced her to Agatha before leaving. Agatha knew her mother was going to some church function.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Good afternoon, Miss Harkness,” Lilia greeted her, “I’m Ms. Calderu, and I’ll be your teacher for the remainder of your high school experience. I understand that you’re actually quite advanced,” The teacher smiled warmly at her, setting books down on the table and sitting.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha looked Lilia up and down. The older woman had long brown hair that she wore up, hazel eyes, and an Italian-New Yorker accent. Agatha propped her chin in one hand. This was going to be fun.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “What’s your first name?” Agatha asked innocently.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I don’t see why that’s relevant,” Lilia replied, sorting through a stack of papers.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You know mine, and if I’m going to be stuck with you for the next several years, it’s only fair I know it,” Agatha reasoned.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I’ve been warned about you, Miss Harkness. Your tactics won’t work, and you won’t scare me.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had indeed heard how Agatha had either outsmarted, outwit, psychologically tortured, or plain seduced any previous person who tried to teach her. Purely for fun. SHIELD was the elder Harkness’s last option. Agatha wasn’t a bad kid. She was just trying to spite her mother.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Oh? Did Evanora warn you? Tell you I was born evil and should have been killed at birth?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha’s face hardened. She no longer looked fourteen, but much older. Lilia wanted to soften but had been warned about this, too.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “No, a mutual friend of ours, and I’ve been told you like a mystery. So, for every lesson we complete, I’ll either answer a question of yours or let you guess who our mutual friend is, agreed?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had always been good with these Hollywood kids. She had grown up adjacent to Broadway and moved out to LA when her best friend had. The child stars had to be given some semblance of control as they had so little of it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha looked at her cautiously, “For each assignment I complete, not a lesson, an assignment could be a worksheet, that could be four or five a session,” She countered, her blue eyes sparkling.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia scoffed. “Every two,” she counteroffered.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Deal.” Agatha agreed.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       That day, Agatha learned that Ms. Calderu was 28, her first name was Lilia, she was originally from New York, and her favorite color was yellow.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       When Lilia returned to the house she shared with her friend, she sat her bag down and sighed.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You’re right. She’s a smart kid but is trouble with a capital T and is shadier than a forest. Her mother is also a complete loon and abusive.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Hollywood superstar Lorna Wu nodded.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I hope to get her out of there one day, sooner rather than later. She has a bright future ahead of her if we remove the crazy factor. That’s where you come in.”

<em>
       “After being outed as a lesbian, and her mother attempting to murder her, Agatha Harkness, the sixteen-year-old award-winning actress, has won her legal battle against her mother and is now legally independent from her…”
      </em>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha cut off the TV that showed a picture of her with a stoic expression on the steps of the Los Angeles courthouse, watching as her mother was escorted away. Evanora had been hurling bible verses at her as they led her away. Lawyers surrounded Agatha, the face of America’s brave lesbian sweetheart. Sixteen and on her own.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She sat in
      </span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
       her
      </span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
       house. She planned on selling it and buying a condo, with Lorna and Lilia in the condo on either side, watching her carefully. She had guessed that Lorna was the ‘mutual friend’ three months into Lilia being her teacher.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I’m sixteen,” She said softly, lip quivering. “I’m sixteen and will be seventeen in a few months. My closest friends are a twenty-nine-year-old movie star who made me the godmother of her child and my thirty-year-old teacher. I am technically a self-inflicted orphan, the face of the queer community, a child star still on the rise, I have a growing reputation for being a bit of a party girl, and people want to be me,” A tear fell down her cheek as she looked at both of them. “I don’t want to be me right now.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia pushed a piece of hair behind her ear. “I know Aggie. We’re both here for you. You have a staff of people, and you are the strongest person we know. You can go to school now if you want. You can stop acting, whatever you want.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “No, I love acting and telling stories. My filming schedule isn’t conducive to going to school, and I’m almost done. I do want to get my college degree, though. I just, it’s a lot. Thank you both for everything you’ve done to get me out of there. Lorna, you’ll be a great mom. I really think if you moved Gran and Alice out here…” Agatha trailed off. She knew it was no use. Lorna was more of a mom to Agatha than Evanora had been, but Lorna was insistent on Alice having a ‘normal’ life.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna pulled out a small box and handed it to Agatha.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “We got you something to commemorate today, and our little coven, so to speak,” Lorna looked to Lilia as Agatha opened the box.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha took in the gold, purple, and ivory locket with the three women on it, looking at the women on either side of her, eyebrows raised in question.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia reached over, pointing to each silhouette as she spoke. “It’s the triple goddess, maiden, mother, crone.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna nodded, adding. “The three of us. Lilia’s the crone,” She grinned. “It’s a reminder that while you’ve freed yourself from Evanora, you’re never alone. We’re in this together, sweetie.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha lightly ran her fingers over the three silhouettes, an idea pushing it’s way to the front of her brain. “Wait one minute!” She got up, her bare feet running to the bathroom and she returned with three small rubberbands and scissors, one of the very few times her age actually shone through her more mature facade.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Cut off a small lock of hair and hand it to me.” The older women did as commanded, and Agatha took the auburn, chestnut, and jet black locks of hair and secured them in the locket.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “There,” she said, voice wavering with the weight of her emotions, “the three of us, together, forever.”

<p>
<em>
<span>
       It was Agatha’s eighteenth birthday. Although she had been an adult for longer, she was now legally an adult. That day, she bought a large piece of land that she eventually wanted to build on. For now, she would need to work on getting permits, clearing the land, and extending utilities to it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha was not like any other eighteen-year-old in the world.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She also was finally going to act on recently developed feelings.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lately, she had begun to see Lilia in a different light.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had always been one of her two mentors. She had come into her life with a mission to free her from Evanora’s clutches, had been there for her during very dark times, and was one of her closest friends.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha absolutely loved Lilia, just as she loved Lorna. Her best friends happened to be in their thirties, and Agatha happened to be more emotionally mature than her eighteen years on this earth. She wasn’t in love with Lilia, no, but she was attracted to her. She always had been to a degree, but now, it was boiling at the edge, and she needed to act on it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       For her birthday, they had rented out a club in downtown LA. She had been drinking. No one cared how old you were when you were as famous as she was. She had finally mustered up the courage, and “Rescue Me” by Madonna was playing when Agatha found Lilia standing on her own.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Perfect.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Happy Birthday, Gorgeous!” Lilia smiled as Agatha approached.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha was fueled by vodka and couldn’t stop. She went all in, hooked her fingers through the belt loops of Lilia’s jeans, and kissed Lilia like it was the last thing she was going to do.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       The best part was when Lilia kissed her back.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha relaxed into the kiss when Lilia forcefully shoved her back, eyes wide, lips swollen.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Agatha, I…” She was stepping away from Agatha in shock. “I hate Madonna,” she blurted before she darted away. Agatha went to go after her when she felt a hand close around her bicep. She turned to see Lorna, eyes full of worry, as she pulled her to a quieter area.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “What were you thinking, Agatha?” she asked. She wasn’t mad, just confused.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You know I’ve always been attracted to her,” Agatha replied. She was leaning against a wall, still fuzzy from the alcohol, arms crossed, eyes trained on the toes of her shoes.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Yes, but that doesn’t mean kiss her the day you’re no longer jailbait, sweetie,” Lorna put a comforting hand on her shoulder. “Do you really want to turn one of your best friends into another conquest? You just turned eighteen, and everyone knows what you’ve been up to since you were thirteen. Now, you can broadcast it. Do you want Lilia to be another on a growing list?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna wasn’t judging. At thirty-one, she had a long list herself and several divorces to her name. There was no shame here. Agatha let out a sound of agreement.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>

       “You’re right.”

       1993 Los Angeles
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha had just returned from several months of filming overseas, and Lorna was still abroad. Things had gone back to normal in the past two years, though Agatha still had feelings for Lilia.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia wasn’t sure how she felt about Agatha, but she knew she didn’t feel right dating her, and she was not going to be another notch in her metaphorical bedpost. She was, however, going to take her out to celebrate her return. Agatha had matured more and looked far less like the fourteen-year-old girl she first met six years ago and more like the woman she was destined to be. Lilia was proud of her. She was racking up awards and rising in fame and popularity. She hadn’t gone the way of some childhood stars, and she was using her fame for good.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia loved and cherished her career. However, she also loved the position it put her in and the proximity to power. You could take the Italian out of New York…
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She dealt in secrets and information, her ability to read people gave her the upper hand on these power players, and she could negotiate a Hollywood contract with the best of them. Lilia was behind some major dealings in Hollywood, and no one would ever know. She had recently purchased an old Victorian mansion and was having it renovated. ‘Oh, an uncle back east passed.’ she had said. More like, ‘Howard Stark closed a major deal with my help. ’
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Some of this knowledge she would pass to Agatha. How to be discreet in your affairs, curate the you that you wanted the public to see. Agatha was going to be a star like no other. She knew it, and so did Lorna. Or at least, that was their hope.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha had told Lilia all about filming and stories about her co-stars. She had been nervous throughout dinner and then afterward at the bar they had gone to. She’d even turned down every woman who approached her, which was very unlike her. Lilia had an idea of what was happening, and she had to stop it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Lilia, I’ve been thinking about what happened when I turned eighteen…” Agatha looked at her nervously.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Agatha, you can’t even legally drink yet,” Lilia knew what she was about to say.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I’m drinking right now. In public.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Not legally.” Lilia pointed out.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Lilia, I’m legally an adult. I own property, in fact, several homes. Hell, I run a successful club in New York, have an EGOT, and more awards than some actors three times my age.” Agatha listed off qualifications as if she were in an interview.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Agatha, you know I don’t care about any of that. I’m not going to be another name on your list.” Lilia didn’t expect Agatha to be offended.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Lilia, that’s not what I want. I respect you too much to just make you another nameless woman in a pile of bodies. I want to date you.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia was shocked. “Agatha, we cannot date. People would talk,” she lowered her voice. “People would think I had had a relationship with you when I taught you. I could lose my career.” Lilia had invested too much to get where she was.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You didn’t though, that’s disgusting. I thought you were pretty, but no.” Agatha wrinkled her nose.

       April 1996 New York City
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It was the opening night of Rent, and Agatha was playing Maureen. She had just put on an amazing performance and was hoping this would be her second Tony. She met Lorna and Lilia backstage, both of them glowing.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Oh, sweetie, you did such a great job! I am so proud of you! Your second Broadway show, and it’s going to be such a success!” Lorna gushed like the proud surrogate mother she was. Alice was seven, yet here Lorna was, a bigger part of Agatha’s life than Alice’s. Agatha would always carry that guilt with her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Do you really think so?” Agatha asked, seeking the approval she so desperately desired.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Of course, you’re the perfect person to play Maureen. No one can cage you.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia added, pulling Agatha in for a hug. They both smelled like the lavender incense that engulfed Agatha’s Brooklyn apartment. Agatha’s feelings for Lilia had only increased, and she knew that once she added alcohol to the mix, she would be making moves tonight.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       They were celebrating opening night and were out with the cast, crew, friends, and family. Lorna had already left with her current flavor of the moment, and Agatha and Lilia had stolen off to a corner and were considering leaving themselves. Agatha had shows the next day and had been drinking.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “How’s the kid?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha asked, referencing the sixteen-year-old Sokovian refugee, Wanda Maximoff. She had recently been taken in by her aunt, a producer, in LA after losing her parents and twin brother after the war had basically wiped her small country off the map. She was a sweet kid and was cast alongside Agatha in a TV show, ‘Sisters’. Agatha was doing Rent for a few months while they were off and then would return to LA. Agatha didn’t trust Wanda’s aunt and was keeping a close eye on her. Agatha fully planned on being the Lorna in her life at Lilia’s insistence if needed. She would have done it anyway. She knew what it was like to be in an abusive environment.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Wanda’s aunt is getting worse, but we have eyes on the kid. She’s asked about you. Give her a call or an email sometime, will you? Wanda misses you. You’re like an older sister to her. She really doesn’t have anyone, and we’re ancient in her eyes. She’s not as mature as you were at that age.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had concern in her eyes and was acting as a teacher to Wanda just as she had to Agatha nearly a decade ago.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I’m glad she has both of you, like I did. How’s Lorna doing?” Agatha asked as they started to head toward the exit.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia just made an exasperated sound. Lorna’s ‘demons,’ as they called it, were increasing. Agatha’s own drinking was increasing, so she couldn’t say much. Lilia was the only one who had any control of anything and had to for her career.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I’m keeping an eye on her. I wish she would move Norma and Alice to LA. Enroll Alice at SHIELD. Norma would keep her healthy, at least. She’d get you into shape, too. Every time you visit them, she lays into you.” Lilia gave Agatha a knowing look.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I know. I know she wants Alice to experience some type of normalcy. She can still be involved, though.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha ended that line of conversation there, switching back to the musical as they talked until they arrived at the apartment in Brooklyn. She had dreams of renovating an entire floor of a building one day, maybe in Manhattan. For now, she liked this one.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha always had an air of confidence bordering on cockiness, and it was partly how she got to where she was. The older she got, the more it grew, and the bolder and more arrogant she became. Her increasing alcohol usage did not help, and her increased tolerance hid her lack of sobriety well.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       They settled for the night, and it was now or, well, next time. Agatha looked at Lilia, who was telling her a very animated story about school. NDAs be damned, Lilia told Agatha anyway and just spoke in initials. They were sitting close together on the loveseat, twisted towards each other. Agatha kept subtly moving closer, something that naturally happened between them until she was leaning against Lilia. Agatha turned her head, their faces inches apart. Their eyes locked.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       This time, it was mutual.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It was passionate.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It was forbidden.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia was, once again, the one to pull back.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Agatha, we can’t.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Instead of panicked, she looked sad.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “We can, and I’ve thought about it. Just listen,” Agatha had both hands on Lilia’s forearm. Lilia had one arm on the back of the couch and a hand on Agatha’s thigh. “You have to go back to LA, and I’m staying here. We both excel at casual. That’s what we do.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia wasn’t so sure.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Agatha, you’ve wanted to date for years. I don’t think you can do casual, and I don’t do monogamous. You’ve known me for almost ten years, and you know my history. Lorna is a serial monogamist. I date many people, and you’re, well you…” Lilia trailed off.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I have a very high libido,” Agatha finished for her. “I can do this, Lilia. Just don’t fall in love with me. I’m very irresistible.”
      </span>

</p>
<p>
<em>

       It was an extremely bad idea.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “YOU HAD SEX WITH AGATHA?! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!” Lorna screamed.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia expected this reaction as they stood in Lilia’s kitchen. Lilia was trying to get her to eat something after a few days of Lorna obviously not eating anything.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “That she’s a very attractive woman and can make her own decisions,” Lilia responded, directing Lorna to the table.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “No, Lilia. You cannot do this. We practically raised her. This is not okay.” Lorna sat, accepting the bowl of pasta from her friend.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “YOU practically raised her. I’m more of an older friend and gay auntie. Okay, yeah, that makes it weird.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You have taught her how to lie, cheat, curate her image, and now what, hone her skills in other areas? No, do NOT tell me about that.” Lorna added as Lilia began to speak. “She is going to fall in love with you, Lilia. She’s been halfway there for years as it is.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “She said it would be casual,” Lilia repeated. She had repeated it to herself over the past few days, trying to make herself feel better about what had happened.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You believe that? Agatha is manipulative. You know that! You, of all people, should be impervious to her tactics, but you let your desires get in your way. I get that she is young, smart, and beautiful. She even makes me question myself. Alas, tragically straight. But Lilia, she’s not one of your Hollywood side items. She’s our Aggie.” Lorna finally took a bite of pasta, trying to let her words sink in.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “What if I want to continue this? What if I like being with her, Lorna?” Lilia asked, slumping into a chair with pasta of her own.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Do you want commitment? Do you want to be public?” Lorna asked between bites, being careful not to eat too fast.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “No. I can’t risk my job like that, teaching or behind the scenes,” Lilia sighed. “I also want her to have someone there for her. Her drinking is getting out of hand and…” She looked away from Lorna, not able to see it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “And I started out as a functional alcoholic, and you don’t want her to spiral like I am?” Lorna raised an eyebrow.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia worried at her bottom lip. She couldn’t voice what she was actually thinking. Yes, Lorna had things mostly under control for now, but that was the real reason she didn’t want Alice and Norma to move to LA. Lilia knew Norma would be tougher on Lorna than Lilia and Agatha were. Norma would light into Agatha, too. It’s what both of them needed, really.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You know I just want what’s best, and I worry. I want you to live to see Alice get married, have kids if she wants, and excel in whatever career she chooses,” Lilia gestured with her hands.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna smiled. She spoke with her mom every day about Alice. “She plays school with her dolls every day. She’s going to teach, like you.” She pointed at Lilia with her fork.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Hopefully, the teaching system gets better. There’s always a place at SHIELD for her.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna shook her head, “You’re going to run that place, could you imagine? Her teaching for you?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia laughed, “Yeah, and Agatha will have kids there. That’ll never happen.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna finished eating and returned to being serious. “Are you going to keep this thing up with Agatha?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia shrugged, “I don’t know. I care for her, and we have fun. What’s a little harmless fun between friends?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “It’s not harmless,” Lorna said darkly.

       “We’re both adults, Lorna.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>

<p>

<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia was trying so hard to be cold to Agatha, and it hurt like hell. She knew why she had to do it. She couldn’t let Agatha fall in love with her. Lorna would murder Lilia. She could not lose Lorna or Agatha. They were the two most important people in her life. Sleeping with Agatha was not the best decision she had ever made, but that was Lilia’s infatuation.

She wanted to wake up with her the next morning, but that really wasn’t her thing, and she couldn’t give the paparazzi anything. Instead, she played the role of the older woman here for casual sex. Lilia played two roles. Lilia, her loving friend and mentor, and Lilia, Agatha’s casual fling..

       Agatha and Wanda had gotten close. Agatha was a Lorna to Wanda. They were on a hit show together, and they had built a house on the land Agatha had bought at eighteen. A gorgeous Russian spy had attempted to kill them, now, said spy lived with them, and her mother was dead.

       However, she could have done without Norma’s lectures, especially when Lilia would take her side every single time.

<p>
<em>

       The five women walked into the large home on Christmas Eve to be welcomed by the small, rambunctious eight-year-old, followed by a joyful but judgy older woman.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Welcome, girls! Come in, get settled in your rooms! You must be Wanda and Natasha!” Norma addressed the two younger women.

<em>

       “Come with me! Where’s your accent from? Gran says our house is like the United Nations!” She chattered as she skipped down the hallway.

      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha had just asked her if she believed in soulmates. Lilia was a student of tarot. Of course, she believed in soulmates.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She sure as hell wasn’t telling Agatha that.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She remained cold, distant, and casual—an older fling.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She believed Agatha had a soulmate somewhere.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia Calderu had to believe she was not that person, though, and it killed her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Right now, she was not letting her emotions color their moment, lying here.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Right now, she focused on Lorna’s warning and her duty to Agatha, to keep her at an emotional arm’s length.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Instead of romance and sweetness, Lilia reverted to her now well-practiced advice on the challenge of maintaining a long-term, steady relationship with the amount of fame Agatha held. She deliberately lectured and called Agatha ‘my pet’ to reduce the intimacy she felt as they recovered from another beautiful time together.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Her tactics worked. Lilia could feel the discomfort and slight hurt from Agatha as the wedge she hammered in place deepened the gap between them. The longer Lilia had to play cold and distant, the harder it became to separate the two identities.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It’s why, though she tried to stay away, stay strong, and stay cold, the infatuation won out, and they always fell back into bed.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia could barely resist Agatha, and she knew that could be as damaging as any addiction.

       Agatha, at an old and wise twenty-six years old, knew that something was going on with the two redheads. It once more brought up the mystery of that night two years ago. There had been no reason for Natasha not to murder Agatha that night, but Natasha hadn’t expected Wanda’s presence— or at least, that’s what the former assassin kept saying. Agatha knew she was lying. No, Natasha hadn’t just been distracted by Wanda; she had been mesmerized. Cupid’s arrow struck the assassin as she confronted her target, abandoning her assignment, and spent the next two years watching Wanda figure out her feelings.

       Now, here sat a Wanda, who seemed younger than her twenty years, asking Agatha how to tell if she liked girls. Agatha knew she should be helpful and supportive. Instead, she cackled. Agatha had always known she was gay. She took one look at boys as a kid, said no thanks, and started going after girls and women.
      </span>

</p>
<p>

<span>
       Now, sweet, innocent, girl-next-door Wanda Maximoff, who had been raised by Agatha for the past four years, was asking for help deciphering her confusing feelings for Nat.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Just go fuck her, Wanda. That will be pretty telling,” Agatha said after she finished laughing.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You are of no help,” Wanda said, getting up to storm off.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Angel, no, seriously. Do you have any desire to do anything with any of these PR guys you’ve been set up with?” Agatha asked.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Wanda sighed, hands gathered on one hip. “No.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “What about Nat?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Wanda looked at the ceiling and blew out a breath.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I want to do unspeakable things and grow old with her,” she finally admitted.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Welcome to club lesbian. Your membership card will be in the mail. Go get your girl,” Agatha grinned.
      </span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha watched as Wanda climbed the stairs, knowing she was headed to Nat’s room.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       If only her own situation were that easy. She was happy to see that these two dear friends would share a sweet moment and maybe more. But their happiness and Wanda’s excitement stirred a hidden pain in her. She and Lilia had been going back and forth for three years now, and things were only getting more confusing.

       Lilia’s Side of the ‘Do You Love Me’ Night
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       They had had a nice night, and Lilia, still vibrant and alluring at forty-one years old, had so wished she could be ‘friend’ Lilia to Agatha right then, but those lines were blurring more frequently. She was in too deep, and she knew she should have listened to Lorna four years ago when this had started. Lilia scolded herself. She should have put a stop to this a long time ago. She still should stop it now.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       To no one’s surprise, Agatha had grown more beautiful and was intoxicating at twenty-seven. Lilia couldn’t get enough of her. There was no gum or patch for this. No twelve-step program. No rehab.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha and Lorna had tried rehab and failed for their vices. Lilia didn’t even have that option. Here she was, trying to get Agatha just to drink wine and not the myriad of alcohols and liquors she had in the fridge. The kid referred to Smirnoff as ‘alcoholic kool-aid’.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia couldn’t believe Agatha had brought up Madonna. She knew she had done it just to goad her, too. Lilia couldn’t stand Madonna’s acting or singing. Agatha adored her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It was a good night with their usual banter, the easiness they built up in the past thirteen years, and then it happened.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha had her legs tucked under her. She was effortlessly beautiful and always had been.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Lilia, do you love me?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had stilled, turning towards Agatha, trying to decide how to answer. They had used that term platonically for years. But no one had ever said so romantically.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Of course I do,” Lilia replied, as she had done so many times before, silently praying Agatha would drop it. Knowing she wouldn’t. Her eyebrows knitted together, preparing what to say next.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “No, I mean, are you in love with me?” Agatha took a deep breath. “It’s just that I am so deeply in love with you. You won’t let me tell anyone we’re seeing each other, while I want to scream it from the rooftops. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and you laugh it off, insisting we see other people.” Agatha’s eyes were watery. Lilia hated being the one who made her cry.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha was right. Every time she brought up that line of conversation, Lilia pulled back, and they stopped things for a bit.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Every single time, they found their way back into each other’s beds.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Every single time, Lorna got pissed at Lilia.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Lorna knows,” Lilia replied, hoping it was some small consolation. She so badly wanted to hold Agatha, console her, and kiss away her sadness. But she didn’t reach out, steeling herself against the emotion and guilt that bubbled within.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha gave a small cry of frustration.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Of course she does! I can’t help that she figured it out! Stop ignoring the question!”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia was surprised by Agatha’s harsh tone. Lorna had suggested she act like she figured it out and not tell Agatha that Lilia had outright told her. Half-truths abounded in their small family.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Yes, I love you, Agatha, but those things are impossible. I don’t want any of that, and you know it. I will not explain it to you again. Now, don’t go ruining a good night before it’s even begun.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia reached for Agatha’s cheek as Agatha retreated backward. It was a knife to Lilia’s heart, and she fought back tears herself. All she really wanted to do was apologize for being this way. Yes, she was in love with Agatha, something that was hard to admit to herself, but she was not a one-woman woman and never would be.It truly wasn’t who she was at heart. Knowing that while she could give in and be happy for a little while, her true nature would eventually emerge and ruin both their relationship and the beautiful woman with whom she was in love.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Leave,” Agatha said abruptly.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “What?” Lilia was shocked. Agatha had never kicked her out before.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You heard me, leave.” She said, standing up and walking to her bedroom.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia watched Agatha walk down the hall as she got up to leave herself. She and Lorna had a New York apartment they shared, and she would call Lorna once she got back. That would give Agatha time to call her first.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha came to Lilia’s four days later to apologize. Lilia planned to be Lilia, the friend. Forgive Aggie and put an end to everything for good.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       But Agatha was water, and Lilia, the lover, was parched in the middle of a desert.

<span>
       She was only thirty, but she felt so much older than Wanda. Things had been going well for her younger sister, and when the scandal broke as Wanda planned her proposal to Nat, Agatha knew it wouldn’t happen. Agatha’s own ‘relationship,’ if you could call it that, was doomed, and here, Wanda had two people madly in love with her and willing to dedicate their lives to her in any capacity.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       The pictures had broken, tabloids and proper newspapers alike displayed them on front pages, and Agatha wanted to burn the whole world down for Wanda.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Is this how Lorna felt about Agatha at thirteen years older? Fiercely protective? Lorna was slowly getting worse but was still a proud mom. The relationship between Lorna and Lilia who was one year her senior, was starting to fissure, and Agatha couldn’t help but wonder if it was her fault. No, it was Lilia. Lilia who was two different people with her, and it was fucking with Agatha and had for going on seven years now.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       But right now? Right now, her priority was the younger sobbing redhead in her arms.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Shhh, Angel. We’re going to figure it out, okay? What do you want me to do? I will gladly commit murder for you. We’ll invest, you can retire and marry Nat. We WILL make it work, okay?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha gently lifted Wanda’s head and looked into Wanda’s eyes the way Lorna had the many times when Agatha had cried over Lilia.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I love you, Angel, and I am going to do everything in my power to make things better, kid, okay?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Wanda nodded, burying her head back into Agatha’s shoulder, effectively wiping snot on her sweatshirt.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I love you too, Aggie. You really are my sister, you know that?” She said between sobs.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I know, honey, I know,” Agatha soothed.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha truly believed that you didn’t need blood to make a family, and she had believed that since she was sixteen. Vision had told Wanda they could call off the engagement, and Nat and Vision both supported Wanda no matter what. Good thing, too, because Agatha happened to know an Italian who could make a few phone calls if needed.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It then dawned on her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You three hold it down here,” She addressed the two women and Vision. “I need to go look into something.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha had called Lorna and Lilia and met them at Lilia’s. Lorna and Agatha were never truly sober anymore. Lorna usually had at least taken a pill of some type, and Agatha was always running on a shot of something. Lilia didn’t know what to do with either of them anymore. Agatha stormed in, dropping the newspaper in Lilia’s lap.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I know the shady shit you do behind the scenes, did you have a hand in this? I told you about Wanda’s plans, and I swear to Lorna if you messed with my sister, not only are we over, but I will murder you right here,” she said menacingly, eyes devoid of any caring feeling.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia gave her a look. “Agatha, I know I can be cold, but I care about those girls too, and I am rooting for them. I would never do that. I didn’t tell anyone, this wasn’t me. We all know that the studios would take a huge hit if America’s STRAIGHT Sweetheart came out as gay too.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha looked at Lorna. “Do you know anything?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna shook her head as she lit her pipe, “No, I’ve been keeping an ear out, though. Howard is passing things off to Tony. If Howard knew, he may have hired someone to get proof that Wanda isn’t squeaky clean to push her back into hiding.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I will fucking murder Tony,” Agatha turned on her heel to head out the door. Lilia stood and grabbed her hand.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Agatha, no. It’s not Tony’s fault, and we don’t even know, okay? It may have just been random paparazzi. You’re not throwing your life away. We wanted to kill Evanora and never did. Now sit down.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia was in caring friend mode and was happy to be there. Agatha flopped in her favorite armchair and started crying.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I just want to protect her!”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna blew out a puff of smoke and passed the pipe to Agatha.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “It’s what I’ve been trying to do for you for years. Sadly, I can’t protect you from everything or everyone.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Her eyes shot to Lilia, who looked away. Lorna took the pipe back, lit the bowl, and took another puff. Neither of them were smoking to get high, merely to calm their nerves and maintain a calm demeanor. She offered the pipe to Lilia, who looked at Lorna like she had grown a second head. Lorna shrugged and passed the pipe and lighter back to Agatha.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You can’t protect them from everything, and it’s one of the many reasons Alice stays with Mom. Speaking of, Mom sent pictures! She basically has Alice’s friend living with them. Cute kid. Here.” Lorna pulled out a stack of pictures, handing them to Lilia. Agatha put the pipe and lighter on the glass coffee table and moved to sit by Lilia to look at the pictures. She laughed as she saw the pictures of Alice and the other fourteen-year-old sitting on inflatable furniture, sticking their tongues out.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Norma’s house is the United Nations,” Agatha noted as they flipped through the pictures. It was the distraction they needed. Lorna nodded.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Puerto Rican kid. Rio. They met two years ago. Similar story as you, shitty parents. She spends most of her time at Mom's unless her parents need her for some scam. Mom said she was skin and bone when Alice dragged her home one day after hearing gunshots at her apartment. They move around a lot. Mom hopes she sticks around or her parents disappear and leave the kid. It makes me feel less guilty for only having one kid.” Lorna got up to rummage in the pantry.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You didn’t need more kids,” Lilia called after her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Damn right,” Lorna called back.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I want kids.” Agatha looked at Lilia.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia shook her head. “I don’t. Besides, that requires you to get sober.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha’s face fell. “I could get sober if I was motivated enough.” She took out a flask and took a long drink.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna came back from the kitchen with a bag of 3-D Doritos.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Why does the Wanda thing bother you so much anyway?” She asked Agatha. Lorna knew why, but she needed Lilia to hear it. Agatha glanced at Lilia before moving back to the armchair.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I want Wanda to be happy. To be with the woman she loves, openly. Have babies. Build a home. All the things I’ll most likely never get to do.” Agatha’s voice had shrunk as she said it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had looked away.
      </span>

       Lorna popped a Dorito in her mouth and turned to Lilia. “Maybe we should listen to our friends, hmm?” she whispered.

       Lilia’s Side of the ‘Baby’ Convo
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia hated it when Agatha brought up having a baby. It meant she had to don her ice queen persona again. This back-and-forth had been going on for ten years. It happened so frequently that Lilia could barely keep track of which version of herself she was anymore.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Agatha, I’m too old to have or raise a child, and with your schedule? I would be a primary parent. People would know we were together then.” Agatha was almost thirty-three, and Lilia herself was nearly forty-seven. She was scheduled to have a hysterectomy soo,n and while she regretted never having kids, she was trying to push it out of her mind. She still didn’t want to risk her career. There was talk of the principal retiring, and she was on the shortlist for it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You’re right about me. I can’t be a good parent with this life.” Agatha conceded.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You can’t risk being your mother.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia wanted to take the words back as soon as she said them and saw the hurt on Agatha’s face. She had gotten so good at being cold when she was this person that it came naturally, and she hated it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia wondered if she had lost who she once was and their relationship had changed so much. Even when they were being friends, it didn’t come as easily. Agatha’s alcohol use had gotten so bad that Lilia’s main concern was the withdrawals in Agatha’s preparations to have a child. Could her body even handle it? She’d been drinking for so long that she wasn’t sure how she would handle it. Lilia knew that Agatha would be an amazing mother.
      </span>

<em>
<span>
       Just not with Lilia.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia hadn’t known that Agatha had taken that as Lilia’s final decision. She had gotten good at continuing to act like she was drinking. But, she had stopped last Halloween and had been preparing to start treatments and trying for a baby.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha didn’t need Lilia in order to have or raise a baby.

       Agatha had gone to Norma’s for a couple of reasons. She needed to bring Lorna back to LA to continue filming their show, and she needed to tell Lorna that she was pregnant. The fertility treatments and artificial insemination had worked. Agatha was going to be a mom.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She hadn’t told Lilia yet and had no idea how she would react.

       Norma opened the door and let her in.

       “I know, and that’s part of why I’m here. I need her to come back and finish filming. I’ll keep an eye on her. I’ll also get her into rehab as soon as we’re done. I’m sober, Norma. If I can do it, so can she.” Agatha explained.

       Norma stepped aside to let her in. Agatha walked down the familiar hallway lined with pictures of Alice and the other teenage girl. It was late, and she didn’t even knock. Norma was awake, and she looked up from her reading. Agatha set down her overnight bag on the floor before she made Norma scoot over.

       Agatha was nervous. Wanda and Nat were overseas and they didn’t even know she was pregnant. hey certainly didn’t know she had been in a quasi-relationship with someone for ten years. Lilia was coming over and she was going to tell her about the pregnancy.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You’re not drinking?” Lilia asked, surprise written all over her face.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Lilia, I haven’t had a drop of alcohol since last Halloween. I’ve been faking it.” Agatha replied casually.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia was suspicious and confused. “Why?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I didn’t want anyone to know I was doing fertility treatments.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       They were sitting in the living room at Agatha’s, she was eating blueberries and drinking water, gauging Lilia’s reactions closely.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had just taken a sip of tea and nearly choked.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “WHAT?” She yelled. “Isn’t that a discussion?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “No. I’m my own person, we aren’t anything,  which you’ve made very clear, and I don’t need you to have or raise a child, Lilia.” Agatha popped another blueberry in her mouth.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia looked at Agatha cautiously, “So are you…”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Pregnant? Yes. Due in May,” Agatha answered before Lilia finished the question. “I don’t expect you to continue this with me, to marry me, to do anything. I know this isn’t what you wanted and I respect that. If that side of this stops, then I do want our friendship back, Lilia,” Agatha laid it out. She wanted Lilia to remain in her life. They didn’t have to keep up whatever they had, but she needed Lilia in her life, in this child’s life.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>

       Lilia stood abruptly. She looked like a fish gasping for air.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I have to go, I can’t, Agatha, I’m sorry,” And she was gone.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha thought she could handle motherhood solo, and she could handle Lilia saying no. But she couldn’t handle her walking out of her life, and the sobs spilled out of her.

</p>
<p>

<p>

<span>
       Lilia went to Lorna’s. She was back in LA and was trying her best to be sober, weed they could handle. Lilia sat on the couch, face splotchy from crying.

</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “God, Lorna. What have I done?” Lilia asked looking at her best friend.

<p>
<em>

       “Been the world’s worst surrogate gay aunt for ten years,” Lorna said, munching on a bag of Chips Ahoy.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Please stop referring to me as that, it makes it sound so creepy,” Lilia already felt terrible enough.

       “What do you want me to say, Lilia? You acted like a bipolar bitch for a decade. I know I’m not a saint, none of us are, but you’ve ruined the kid when it comes to relationships, do you not see that? She is in love with you and tries so hard to hide it. You love her too, in your own infatuation way,, but you’re not the settling-down type and that’s okay. She doesn’t hold it against you as long as she gets to be with you. This whole thing never should have started. AS I SAID. She’s not even asking for you to marry her or help her raise the kid, she just wants you to stay in her life and be her friend again Lilia, yet you’re in too far and you can’t separate the two Lilias anymore.” Lorna looked at her, face hard. “I told you this would happen, and Lilia, all you had to do was listen, but just like always, you think you know best.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “So sorry that I didn’t take advice from you!” Lilia spat.

       Lilia left SHIELD in September, she hadn’t told anyone, and it was part of the reason she had been such an ass lately. That and her hysterectomy. The loss of children she never had and never would grated on her soul, but she wasn’t saying that out loud to anyone. She regretted what she had said to Lorna, and she didn’t mean it. Not really. She loved Lorna and she would never hold her addiction against her, just like she didn’t hold Agatha’s against her. Lilia was so proud of Agatha for being in recovery, no matter what it had taken.
      </span>

</p>
<p>

       The pregnancy news shocked her, but Agatha would be a fantastic mother if she could balance it with her career.

       Lilia had a tarot reading done weeks earlier. New beginnings, it said. New life.

       Maybe she was supposed to take a chance with Agatha.

<span>
       Agatha was shocked to see her at the door.
      </span>

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Lilia? What are you doing here?” Agatha’s voice was full of skepticism.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “May I come in?” Lilia was nervous and lacking the confidence she always had.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha stepped aside as Lilia walked past her. “I’ve been thinking, Agatha, I do love you, and I have, for years. I’m sorry for before, but I am here now.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia’s voice was sincere and shaking with the weight of the words. She looked at Agatha, Lilia’s eyes were full of years of regret and poor judgment.
      </span>
</em>

<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha was cautious.

       Lilia kissed her in a way that actually conveyed love and not ownership. Agatha let her carefully built guard down.

<p>
<em>
<span>
       A high-pitched tone replaced the doctor’s voice as she droned on and Agatha felt her chest tighten. She hadn’t even told Lilia she was going to the doctor, afraid of what was happening. Lorna was with her instead. Lorna wrapped her arms around Agatha’s shoulders.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha couldn’t even cry. She just felt hollow. Her precious baby. Her child.

       “Now, after the fetus passes and there’s an exam, it may take a few months…

       Agatha knew Lorna was listening for her, thankfully. Something about how long it would be before cycles returned and she could try again. Fertility and success percentages.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It wasn’t something she was concerned about right now. Right now she was concerned about her body failing her. It had one basic job and it had failed. Or had she failed it?

<p>
<em>
<span>
       “This is rather common, 1 in 4…”

       Her doctor was trying to comfort her with statistics and Agatha just wanted to scream.
      </span>

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Would Lilia still marry her? Why was Agatha even having those thoughts? Surely she would. Lilia loved her, right?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>

       The doctor finally handed a card to Lorna before putting her hand on Agatha’s shoulder.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “If the fetus doesn’t pass in about a week, give us a call, I am so sorry Ms. Harkness,” with that, she left the room.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha looked at Lorna, she knew she had been crying silently, as Lorna handed her tissues.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Oh sweetie, I am so sorry. I love you so much. What do you need?” Lorna took it upon herself to wipe Agatha’s face.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Just take me home?” She asked meekly. She didn’t want to be here in this gown anymore, she just wanted to be home, in her bed.

       “Of course, Aggie, whatever you want.”

       When Agatha told Lilia, she didn’t react, just nodded. They were to be married in three days on the beach. She craved Lilia’s love and warmth. Agatha had lost a baby but all Lilia could do was nod.

       Lilia wasn’t going to show up. It was apparent now. Lorna’s phone rang and she answered it. It was Lilia. She said, “Tell her I’m sorry,” before the line went dead.

       Lorna turned to Agatha, sorrow in her eyes.

       Agatha fell to her knees, sobbing.

       She lost her entire future in three days.
      </span>

       Lorna walked her up to the beach house and helped her get changed. That day, Agatha drank and cried herself to sleep. It was the first drink that crossed her lips in over a year. Lorna would stay and make certain Agatha remained safe. Her maternal instincts, repressed for so long, were on heightened alert. When she went off to get Agatha some water to help flush her system, she returned to a scene that broke her heart for her pseudo daughter for the second time that day. Agatha was finally asleep, her tri-goddess locket in her hand. On the floor lay a small lock of hair. Lorna didn’t have to look closely to understand what had happened. Agatha had removed Lilia from her life.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Once Lorna was certain Agatha was safely asleep, she drove over to Lilia’s and stormed through the door.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>

       She slapped Lilia the minute she saw her.

       “HOW COULD YOU!?” She screamed. Lorna saw red.
      </span>

<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I can’t be tied down, I just, I can’t Lorna.” Lilia rubbed her cheek. It stung, but she deserved it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You have to talk to her, she deserves that much. She thinks you left her because she miscarried.” Lorna was so mad she could spit nails.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I think the baby clouded my judgment…” She told Lorna about the reading.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “YOU AGREED TO GET MARRIED BASED ON TAROT?!” Murder was the only thing on Lorna’s mind.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I knew you wouldn’t understand. I think I misunderstood the new beginnings card. I was offered the principal position at SHIELD, and I think that’s where I need to be. I also can’t do that while with Agatha. Neither of us would truly be happy. She needs someone closer to her age, or younger. I would eventually be unfaithful, we both know that. She needs someone who can compliment her lifestyle and career, someone who hasn’t fucked with her for ten years. Someone who doesn’t tell half-truths, who loves her fiercely. None of that is me, Lorna.” Lilia tried to defend herself and knew she was failing.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You basically fucked with my daughter, Lilia,” Lorna spat.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I don’t get you, Lorna! You treat her like this daughter you never had and let her come between us. But you HAVE a daughter that you NEVER see. Agatha is only thirteen years younger than you, and you’re closer to her than your own flesh and blood. Why is that? Why do you choose her over Alice? Over everyone?” Lilia was furious.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Because we saw what growing up in this world did to Agatha. You know what having famous parents has done to those brats you teach. How entitled and spoiled they are. Alice is none of those things. Alice is grounded. Alice saw a kid in trouble and acted like we did, Lilia. Your brats wouldn’t do that. Agatha was an alcoholic before she was ten, just like other kids in this town. Do you think I want Alice around me? No. She doesn’t need to see me like this! Alice has a better chance in life because of my choices.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “If I can shape Agatha at all, I’m going to fucking do it, and God knows I’m trying. You were trying too until you decided to fuck her and ended up breaking her, and she is broken, Lilia. She is one of the strongest women I know and I don’t know if I can pick up the pieces this time after what you’ve done.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna had never spoken to Lilia this way. They had never spoken to each other this harshly and they had never fought like this. Not over Lorna’s demons, not over other disagreements, nothing.

       “I never meant for any of this to happen. I had to separate myself into two different people. I want to console her and tell her everything is okay, yet I’m the one that did this. I lost one of the people closest to me.” Lilia sobbed.

       Lilia visited twelve hours after Nicky was born. Wanda and Nat were delighted to see her. hey had missed her coming around. She blamed work. They were trying to put more effort into the athletics department and it was taking a lot of time to find quality coaches, and she was starting to scout college players.
      </span>

       Lorna suggested to the two youngest women that they go in search of food, letting Lilia and Agatha have time alone with Nicky.

       “Why are you here, Lilia? I accepted your apology. You are off the hook.” Agatha said dryly, holding a sleeping Nicky. He had been fed, burped, and changed, and was now sleeping peacefully. Lorna had been the first one to call him Nicky minutes after he was named.

       Lilia had told Agatha the same thing she had told Lorna, when Agatha finally agreed to talk to her again. Lilia was honest, even including that the pregnancy had clouded her judgment and that she still loved her, but not in the way that justified marriage.

       Agatha had left Nicky with Wanda, Vision, and Nat. She was back in San Francisco to bring Lorna back for filming. The story was that she had gone to Norma’s to get clean.

       It was a lie.

       “The girls are visiting, so I’m not sure if that’s helping or hurting, but she’s not doing great, as expected,” Norma looked stressed and Agatha didn’t blame her. She was worried as well.

       “I’ll go talk to her then.”

</p>
<p>
<em>

       It didn’t matter what Lorna had been diagnosed with. What mattered was that for all of her years battling addiction, it was something unrelated that had her health declining.

       Agatha emerged from Lorna’s room, eyes puffy and red. She was headed to the kitchen when once again, she ran into Rio. She had slightly matured but still looked like the teenage girl that she was.

</p>
<p>
<em>

       “We must stop meeting like this,” Agatha said, her throat was raw and her voice was hoarse.

       “Hi Ms. Harkness,” Was all Rio could manage as she blushed.

       “Sure do.” Agatha noticed Rio get flustered. “Have a good night kid, I need water,” Agatha winked at the young girl and walked past her. She was exhausted but never got tired of people fawning over her. She didn’t know that the next time she saw Rio would be at Lorna’s funeral.

       Lorna stood in front of Lilia’s house. She had to do this. She was dying and she was going to soon. But do it on her terms. But first, she had to talk to Lilia. They wouldn’t be able to go back to how they were, but she at least had to talk to her. Lorna took a deep breath and knocked on the door. Lilia looked like a ghost was standing before her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You look like shit. I thought you were sober?” She said it as a question, stepping aside and helping Lorna in.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Different types of drugs, these are prescribed,” Lorna half laughed, as she took a seat. “I’ll cut to the chase. I’m dying and I want to say I’m sorry for the way I said what I said,” Lorna chewed on her lip, not meeting Lilia’s eyes.
      </span>

       “Yeah, this is a wig, the press and media, no one knows.” Lorna looked away. “I don’t want to die with things still shitty between us. I don’t want Aggie to think it’s her fault.”
      </span>

<em>

       Lilia’s face fell. Right, of course, this was for Agatha.

<em>

       “So, this is more for Agatha, not so I don’t live with guilt for the rest of my life,” Lilia said slowly.

       Lorna sighed.

<p>
<em>
<span>
       “She will never be the same. Ever. She throws everything she has into that beautiful boy of hers, into Wanda’s babies. Wanda had twin boys, by the way. The three of them are going to be terrors,” Lorna had a wistful smile, how badly she wanted to watch the three of them grow up. “She’s promised to watch over Alice. To try and get Alice here, to you. To SHIELD.” Lorna looked at Lilia hopefully.
      </span>

       “What? You want Alice at SHIELD? Lilia repeated.
      </span>

<em>

       “I may still blame you for destroying Agatha, but I know Alice will be in good hands there. I need eyes on Alice, Mom won’t be around forever and I need people around her, to tell of the person I really was. She didn’t get to know me and that’s my fault. I just need people who will love her in the way I would. You also have to watch over those boys Lilia,” Lorna was staring into Lilia’s soul.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Agatha isn’t going to let me do that, Lorna,”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Yes, she will. If you tell her that I wanted you too, she will.” They both knew that Lorna was right.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “So keep manipulating her? Didn’t we do that enough when she was younger?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>

       Lilia had wondered over the past years just how much damage they had both done to Agatha.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “We guided her Lilia. There’s a difference,” Lorna looked like she was trying to convince herself more than Lilia.

<p>
<em>
<span>
       “How long?” Lilia whispered.

       Lorna’s head shot up. Lilia had struck a nerve. “Because I’m not the one who was in the wrong, Lilia. I’m not the one who broke Agatha. I’m not the one who caused the damage. I came to clear my conscience, yes, but you should have come to me long ago,” Lorna sighed as she got up. “I can die in peace now. This is yours to live with now. Goodbye, Lilia.”

<em>
<span>
       After winning an Oscar, Lorna had insisted on going to an after-party. Agatha had wanted to take Lorna home. She wasn’t doing well at all and Agatha knew the end was near, something in her gut told her it was. Lorna hadn’t told anyone about her diagnosis. Only Agatha, Lilia, and Norma knew. She allowed everyone to think she had relapsed. The way she looked certainly supported that narrative.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She didn’t want anyone’s sympathy, didn’t want anyone to think of her as a sob story that had beaten her addiction only to be taken by some cruel twist of fate. So she controlled the narrative. The Witches’ Road was a dark movie. She said it had consumed her, taken a toll on her psychologically that she couldn’t deal with alone.
      </span>

<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha hated it.

       Lilia was nowhere to be found.
      </span>

<p>

       Wanda, and everyone else, believed it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       When Lorna collapsed at the party and 911 was called, Agatha knew it was the end.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She knew Lorna wasn’t going to make it to the hospital.

       Lorna made her promise to watch after Alice.

       Agatha rode in the ambulance.

       Lorna was pronounced dead before they even reached the hospital.

       The Funeral
      </span>

       Norma had closed the funeral to celebrities. The media said it was because she was angry and blamed Hollywood for Lorna’s death.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       In reality, it was because she didn’t want it to turn into a media circus.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She knew Agatha and Wanda would be there in disguise. She had asked them to do so. Alice and Rio didn’t know that. A few other celebrities had done it that way.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had disguised herself as well.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha, Wanda, and Nat hugged Norma out of sight in a back hallway. Wanda and Nat offered their condolences before slipping into the main area, leaving Agatha and Norma alone.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Norma, I…” Agatha’s voice betrayed her as she started to cry.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Agatha, it’s not your fault. You can’t heal the sick,” Norma looked at Agatha the way Lorna did, causing Agatha to cry harder.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You shouldn’t have to bury your child,” Agatha admonished in between her crying.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Norma was crying herself as she looked at her tenderly. “Once Lorna fell into this cursed lifestyle, I knew I would outlive her. I started having some hope when she was pregnant and sober, but then I found myself raising my grandchild. When Lorna finally achieved sobriety, I thought maybe she would be a parent to Alice and outlive me. Fate is a cruel mistress. I hold nothing against you, Agatha, and neither does Alice. You’ll be able to make it up to her in due time, and I trust you will. Right now, you need to grieve. I grieved my daughter long ago, and while I am grieving, I always knew that this was the most likely outcome. I used to think so about you, too. You proved me wrong. Now, go talk with Alice,” Norma hugged her. Though Norma was crying, but had much more composure than Agatha did. Norma turned to head back into the main room before pausing at the door and turning her head slightly.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Lilia is here.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       With that, Norma pushed through the door and disappeared.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha and Wanda waited until after the funeral to pull Alice aside.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “This is from your mother.” Agatha handed her the large manilla envelope. “There’s a lot in here she wanted you to have. You also need to read this,” Agatha handed her a letter. “You’re going to have a lot of questions kid. You need to call me. I know you graduate this year and there’s a job at a school in LA if you want it…”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Alice cut her off, “Why would I go there, Agatha? I saw what Hollywood did to my mom.” Alice’s eyes were dark, haunted. “It took her away from me, Agatha. I only saw her on holidays and when she tried to get clean.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Alice’s words stabbed at Agatha, releasing guilt that had built up for years. Hollywood hadn’t taken Lorna away from Alice, Agatha had. Agatha was sixteen when Alice was born, and Lorna had been putting everything she had into making sure Agatha was safe, that Agatha was okay. That Agatha had a mother figure.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       When Lorna had found out she was pregnant, Agatha and Lilia insisted she keep the baby.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna took Alice to Norma, “Mom, I can’t possibly care for an infant in this environment. She needs a Norma, not a Lorna.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia and Agatha had tried to convince Lorna to raise Alice with their help, but Lorna refused. She was adamant that Alice grow up far away from the life they led.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha knew Alice was better for it, but it didn’t mean she had any less guilt.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Just read the letter, please. I don’t know what it says, but it was important to your mom,” Agatha hugged her and left. Wanda and Nat followed behind.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       As they left, Agatha saw Lilia out of the corner of her eye. “You two go ahead, I’ll be right there.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Wanda shrugged and she and Nat went to the car as Agatha turned and walked to Lilia.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I didn’t know if you’d come,” Agatha said softly. She expected to be angry, but couldn’t find the energy.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Of course I did,” Lilia stared straight ahead.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I’m glad you came, Lorna told me…” Agatha couldn’t finish the sentence.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia looked down. “How did it happen?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Her own terms. In my arms. We made it to the back of the ambulance,” Agatha swallowed hard. It would forever be a core memory for her.

</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Dramatic as always.”
      </span>
</em>

       Agatha chuckled at that, “Lifetime Achievement Award just for that.”

       “Agatha,” Lilia turned to look at her.

       Agatha was on the phone with Alice, who was very confused.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “This whole time and you’ve been my godmother?” Alice was shocked.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Yes. I was sixteen and your mother thought it was a good idea to potentially leave you with me. I was stunned.” Agatha laughed. It was good to talk to Alice.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “And she really had been sober…” Alice was proud of Lorna and finally understood her decision at the end.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Yes, I was so proud of her,” Agatha echoed Alice’s earlier sentiment.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I don’t hate you, Agatha. Mom explained why she made the decisions she did. Gran has raised me in a way that I don’t think Mom was capable of. She also talked about some of the men she was with and no thank you. She basically gave me this little alternative family.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I appreciate that, though anytime you need anything, I’ll be there. I’ll always feel like I took your mom away from you. The men were terrible, though, and I’m glad you found your chosen family, too.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I don’t think I’m ready to move out there yet. Gran needs me.” Alice wasn’t ready to leave Gran, and it was too soon to enter her mother’s old world.

       July 2012 SHIELD
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Nicky would be in Pre-K that year, and SHIELD was the only institution Agatha trusted, whether she wanted to or not. Lilia of all people was droning on and on as she showed her around. They were doing a pretty decent job at pretending like they didn’t know each other. Agatha couldn’t take it anymore, and they were in a deserted hallway in the elementary building.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Lilia, cut the bullshit,” Agatha stopped walking and leaned against a wall. Her heart still ached from the loss of Lorna, and Lilia reminded her of what she had lost. “You’re the only person I trust to oversee Nicky in a sea of children.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia's eyebrows shot up. “You trust me?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “With my son, Lilia. Not with me. There’s a difference.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha knew Lilia was great with kids and she knew that Lilia would protect Nicky with everything she had. She would treat Wanda’s boys with a side of favoritism as well. Agatha herself was a different story.  Lilia looked away.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Got it. You know I’ll take care of him, Agatha. As if he were mine.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “He could have been,” Agatha turned and started back to the office to finish enrollment.

<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Aggie, wait.”
      </span>

       Agatha froze but didn’t turn around. “You don’t get to call me that anymore.”

<p>
<em>

       “I’m sorry,” Lilia said sincerely. “Did you actually change your middle name, legally?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Yes,” Agatha was tense and refused to turn back.

<em>
<span>
       “Is it actually ‘Fucking’?”
      </span>

       “What did you really change it to?”

       Agatha had disguised herself at Norma’s funeral, Alice didn’t need to deal with anyone knowing that Agatha was there. Agatha wanted to be there for Alice, she needed someone. Agatha and Alice had kept in touch over the past three years, unbeknownst to almost everyone.
      </span>

<p>

       “Psst, kid.” Agatha stepped up next to Alice. She was wearing a blonde wig and oversized sunglasses.

       Alice nodded. “I don’t want to leave Rio, but I think it’s time.”

       “Good. Let me know what you need. I’m hiring a new right-hand girl. She can help you get set up in LA.” Agatha squeezed Alice by the shoulders. “Welcome to the family, kid. We’re fun.”

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had only professional interactions with Agatha. That is to say, only in her professional capacity, although she took every one of them personally. Agatha was always a fierce competitor, and as a mother, she was unbeatable. Every time Nicky found himself in trouble, there was Agatha, convincing Lilia to let him off the hook. She knew Agatha thought it was because of her powerful personality, but  Lilia had never overcome the guilt and sadness of the losses of the most important women in her life. She let it color her interactions with Agatha and allowed the starlet to get away with anything. Even when against school policy or when it dealt with Wanda's twin boys.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha always treated Lilia with a side of cynicism, but her anger lost its edge the day that Lilia showed up to the house with a bag of sick-day material.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia was at Agatha’s house, Nicky was a freshman, fourteen, and had mono. She came to make him soup like she had done for Agatha when she had caught mono from another actress when she was sixteen.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha opened the door and her eyes went wide seeing Lilia with the oldest pot on the planet.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Is the tetanus free?” She asked once she had recovered.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Oh shut up and move over Harkness.” She pushed past Agatha and easily found her way into the kitchen.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Lilia, what the hell are you doing?” Agatha followed her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Do you remember when you had mono?” Lilia asked, placing the pot of soup on the stove and turning on the burner.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha smiled at the memory. “Unfortunately. You made me some Italian soup from scratch in that same pot, which I swear made me feel so much better. You also had some type of tea, and homemade bread, made me watch The Wizard of Oz, and sleep,” Agatha recalled.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “All of that, except the sleep, is in that bag,” Lilia gestured to a bag on the counter.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha pulled everything out of the bag and smiled, yet she was confused. They didn’t have this type of relationship and hadn’t in a long time.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Why are you doing this Lilia?” Agatha leaned against the kitchen counter and crossed her arms over her chest.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia stirred the soup as it heated, turning her head to look at Agatha.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You were always terrible at taking care of the sick, and Agatha, I do care about him, and you too, I know things may never be the same between us, but if I can occasionally do something for him, and maybe even you, I’m going to. So excuse me while I finish this magical soup for the kid,” Lilia fixed Nicky's soup, bread, and tea, and pushed Agatha to take it up to Nicky. He was surprised to see real soup, not something out of the can, and ate eagerly.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha sighed. If she was being honest with herself, she missed Lilia, the old Lilia. Her friend and the woman that would take care of her when she was sick, or teach her how to cook. The woman who was caring for her son, that was the Lilia she missed. Not the woman whose memory was tattooed on her hip. No, that was a different woman entirely, wasn’t it?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       By early 2024, Agatha and Lilia were on even ground with each other. Nicky was calming down. He had earned the starting quarterback position the previous fall after the previous quarterback was injured. He knew that in order to remain the quarterback for the varsity squad, he had to keep any and all pranks to a harmless minimum. He had also started seeing Morgan Stark, someone he had known since he was four, in a much different light. He didn’t want to lose his chance in any of these respects, so he adjusted his behavior accordingly. Now, Lilia had fewer reasons to call Agatha to deal with her son, and Agatha had fewer reasons to show her sharp tongue. It was a new equilibrium. It wasn’t much. But, it was a start.

       Alice abruptly hung up the phone as she got up from the couch and headed towards the door, grabbing her bag. “I have to go to San Francisco, I’ll be back in a few days. It’s an emergency,” she said over her shoulder at the other four members of the coven.
      </span>

       “No. It’s Rio, I’ll be back.”

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I’ll kill the fucking bitch.” Alice saw red and she was looking around for any sharp object she could find.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Alice, no. Lou didn’t do this, Shane did. She would never hurt me, she loves me.” Rio slurred from the pain medication.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Therapy. You need therapy.” Alice was pacing. “You’re moving to LA, my boss is coming out here tomorrow. Just do a small interview, please?” Alice pleaded.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She had tried to get Rio to SHIELD for years, and now it was the only way to make sure she was completely safe.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Rio let out a defeated sigh. “I’ll talk to her okay?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Rio Vidal would be the perfect addition to SHIELD. But she was very much a broken woman, physically and emotionally. It didn’t take a psychic to see that. It reminded Lilia of a memory she had buried from long ago. No one should be hurt like that without a chance to heal. Somehow, she had to give Rio just that chance. Alice would be key to that. So would the little family that Agatha had pulled Alice into. Maybe Rio could also fill part of that gaping wound she had opened in Agatha? But that was one stubborn fifty-year-old woman. Maybe Rio would be up to that challenge or distraction, too? Perhaps with enough work, there could be room again for Lilia in their lives. It wouldn’t be what it once was, but to have Aggie back in her life would be enough.

      Reaction chapter on Saturday (hopefully)!
     </p>
<p>
      This was a hard one to write. I always knew that Lilia had turned herself into the villain in Agatha's story, though she never intended for that to happen, but damn.
     </p>
<p>
      Also, LORNA?! God.
     </p>
<p>
      Damnit Lorna.
      <br/>
      For those of you that don't remember Agatha and Rio meeting before, Chapter 3 and 5 reference it, though it's vague.
      <br/>
      Now we know why Agatha made sure the boys went to therapy as kids. Well-adjusted humans with healthy coping mechanisms from the start.
     </p>
<p>
      Does she still drink? Sure. Does she sometimes drink too much? Maybe.
     </p>
<p>
      Is she in control now?
      <br/>
      Absolutely.

       Lilia was Agatha’s ex.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt as though the walls of the familiar venue were closing in on her. She looked around frantically. She couldn’t fall apart here, not on her sister’s big day. She would never do this to Alice. She had to get out and get out now. Rio slipped into a back hall, thankful that she had driven. Agatha could call her driver. Rio didn’t care. Seriously, fuck Agatha. No wonder Agatha hadn’t wanted to tell her. Lilia?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio needed to talk to Alice, but she couldn’t.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had so many questions for Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had so many questions for Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio needed an Ouija board.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio didn’t know what to do.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stumbled through the back hallways towards the parking garage, stopping to empty the contents of her stomach. She was reeling from the revelation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She knew that Agatha and Lilia had known each other for a long time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Since Agatha had been fourteen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She thought back to The Harkness Brag Room. Why weren’t there more pictures with Lilia in that room?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She retched yet again on the concrete, leaning against an unfamiliar vehicle. Unfortunately, it wasn’t Lilia’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Snippets of previous conversations sprung to her mind as she climbed into her car.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I was young, twenty-three, and I had chased her for years…”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a feral scream. Rio remembered when she stood in Lilia’s office to ask if she could experiment with her chemistry class using open flames and different chemicals. Lilia had, of course, agreed. But, as she watched Lilia consider her request, Rio had noticed several pictures around the office, including one of Lilia, Lorna Wu, and Agatha on the opening night of Rent.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Yet, in every picture Agatha had from that night, Lilia was missing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She drove away from the venue toward Agatha’s house to collect Raven. They couldn’t stay there right now. The urge to snoop and find evidence of Lilia being Swords crept in. Rio quickly dismissed it. She had all the evidence she needed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I call her Swords.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio recalled seeing the deck of tarot cards in Lilia’s office. Lilia also had a few signed Playbills and posters hanging around her office. She had several of Agatha’s, mainly from 2006 and earlier, which fit with the timeline that formed in Rio’s mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She grew more conflicted by the second.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio needed her emotional support Raven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then she needed to return to her apartment and plan which of these Hollywood cougars to confront first.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was angry.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was disgusted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was hurt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It had been thirty minutes since Agatha had last seen Rio. One minute, Rio was standing and observing everything from the side, taking it all in. Agatha looked over and winked at her, eliciting a gorgeous smile. Rio, in that orange dress that Alice had picked out with her. Rio’s hair had gotten longer in the past few months, and she kept tossing it over her shoulders. Rio, with her brown eyes that expressed everything and saw into the depths of Agatha’s soul. Rio, the woman who had absolutely shown Agatha what love was truly supposed to be, even if Rio’s own history caused doubts. They had been able to work through them all - together and in such a short time. Weddings had never made Agatha wistful or weepy, but now? With Rio? She was starting to think of a future that she had previously thought impossible.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And it no longer terrified her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But at this moment, Agatha could not locate Rio. Agatha’s eyes scanned the area for any sign of her and saw none. She took a mental headcount of the coven and children, four sapphics, two adult queer men, six teens, herself, no Rio. She pulled out her phone and called, straight to voicemail. Agatha began to worry but didn’t want to alarm Alice. The psychotic blonde had been sent to The Island, never to be heard from again, so she didn’t need to worry about that. She locked eyes with Wanda as she headed toward the redheads.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda saw the alarm in Agatha’s eyes, no matter how hard she was trying to hide it. “Aggie, what’s wrong?” She asked, meeting her in the middle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Have you seen Rio? Her phone is going straight to voicemail.” Agatha was trying to appear calm, though Wanda saw right through it. Wanda looked over at Nat, who had her phone out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m tracking her now. It's a good thing she never takes that necklace off.” Nat looked up at both of them. “Oh, I can track the necklaces whether the buttons are pushed or not. Emergency feature. Seems Rio already left. It shows she’s headed back to the compound.” She looked at Agatha, clearly confused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda gave Agatha a look. “What did you do this time??”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha threw her hands up. “I didn’t do anything, I promise.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Maybe the festivities led her to have doubts again?” Wanda wondered out loud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head. “No, I think we’re okay there. The only thing I’ve kept back is ‘the ex’s’ identity. But, I haven’t told any of you that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha threw her hands up in the air in frustration.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Maybe something just happened to her. How did this end up as my fault? Stop giving me that look. Your face is going to freeze like that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pulled out her phone when it dinged with a text from Rio.

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda raised an eyebrow. “Do you believe her?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha bit her lip and shook her head. “No, but I’m about to be the best girlfriend ever. Tell Alice and Jen I love them, and take my kid home, please. I need to go take care of a sick Rio.”

      Rio had gotten back to the apartment and found a spiral notebook. She knew she couldn’t just march over to Lilia’s without being entirely sure that it was Lilia. The Swords that Agatha talked about was cold and distant. A heartless bitch that didn’t love Agatha and had left her at the altar.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The Lilia Calderu she knew was manipulative and cryptic, sure, but she had also let Rio off on late notice to go gallivanting around the world with Agatha. She had given her insight into Agatha and noticed when she was anxious.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Frantically, she wrote down everything she had thought of while in the car. Starting with when she met Lilia a year ago. She knew she had to sort out her thoughts before confronting either of the older women.

      Rio stopped writing and thought back on different interactions and what she knew. Lilia being Swords would explain why she had such a soft spot towards Nicky, but so would Lilia and Agatha being close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia and Agatha didn’t act like they had been close for thirty-seven years. They didn’t act like bitter exes, either.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was some weird middle-ground.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That also explained why no one else knew. Leave it to Agatha to not want her past to cloud other people's judgment of someone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So WHY had Lilia pushed Rio towards Agatha? She needed to talk to Lilia. Lilia had emotionally scarred Agatha and ruined her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This same woman had helped Rio find a home and allowed her to coach again, knowing it would bring her joy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Had she done that out of loyalty to Alice, because of her last name?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      What in the holy hell was happening? It was eight on Saturday night, and the reception had been wrapping up, so hopefully, Lilia would be home by now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio grabbed her keys and headed to Lilia’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had soup, crackers, Gatorade, and everything she needed in case Rio had actually fallen sick. If she had had time, she would make soup herself. It was something Lilia had taught her how to do that week Nicky had mono.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The week that an unspoken truce had been made between them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha even had a giant stock pot now that would one day also be ancient and possibly come with a side of tetanus.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       If you’re lucky,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Lilia had said, shaking her head at Agatha’s sarcasm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had even picked up treats for Raven and flowers for Rio. Agatha commended herself for getting better at this girlfriend thing. She was hoping she would still have a girlfriend in a few hours. Agatha was still in her suit from the reception as she knocked on Rio’s door and waited.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nothing. Just as she feared.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Maybe she’s asleep.” Agatha thought aloud. She used her key and let herself inside. “Baby? It’s just me. I brought you soup! From the place you like down on the corner!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She put everything in the kitchen and checked around the apartment, looking in the bedroom. Agatha flopped on the bed. Raven lifted her head and meowed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My thoughts exactly, Raven.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha called Rio, surprised when she answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey baby, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you I was leaving.” Rio’s voice was hollow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s okay. I was just going to stop by and bring you some soup and other things. Maybe we can watch a movie?” Agatha asked, hoping Rio would tell her the truth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know, I just got out of the shower and am going to bed. I’ll call you tomorrow.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sure, my love. I hope you feel better. I love you, Rio.” Agatha was holding back a sob.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Goodnight, Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The line went dead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hung up the phone and cried. Raven came over and rubbed against her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What have I done now?” Agatha asked Raven, searching for answers in those wise, feline eyes. Then the horror of the possibility hit her. Could Rio have figured it out?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I should have just told her it was Lilia, and then I could have explained everything, how I was young and stupid. What young lesbian doesn’t fall for an older woman? God, Raven. Why am I like this? She went to Lilia’s, didn’t she?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Deep down, Agatha knew she had.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Raven hopped down from the bed and started walking toward the living room. She stopped and looked back at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What? You want me to follow you? Did Timmy fall down a well? You know, following an immortal cat isn’t the strangest thing I’ve done.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stood and followed Raven into the living room. Raven jumped onto the coffee table and pawed at the open notebook Rio had been writing in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She does know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at everything Rio had written down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course, she has pictures in her office. Idiot.” Agatha scoffed. “Okay, Raven, here’s the play. I leave everything I brought for her, including your treats, I write her a note, go home and cry, and then it’s up to your mom and whatever fucking Lilia says.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Raven meowed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, I know. I’m fucked, and not in any of the fun ways.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had been to Lilia’s a handful of times but had the address to the Victorian house in Angelino Heights saved in her phone. She wasn’t sure if she was glad Lilia was home or disappointed. She had just hung up with Agatha and was upset with herself. Rio had lied to Agatha and hadn’t told her she loved her because she felt conflicted. The plethora of feelings roared back to life as she walked up to the door and knocked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia was not surprised to see her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was wondering when you would figure it out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia turned, walking back into the house, not waiting for Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was right on her heels.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So you just expected me to figure it out on my own? KNEW I would come over?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I read people, Rio. It’s how I’m so good at my job. Tea?” Lilia offered, walking to the kitchen like she had invited Rio over, not like it was possibly her last few minutes on earth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What? No! I’m pissed and homicidal, Lilia!” Rio was still following her, hands flailing. She couldn’t stay still. Lilia walked back to the living room with a cup of tea and sat down on a grey, overstuffed couch while Rio began her habit of covering every inch of floor space.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know you’re going to walk around while you rant, but feel free to sit when you need to. You know how Agatha reads people? I taught her that,” Lilia said, sipping the hot liquid, and the subtle reminder of Lilia’s influence over Agatha enraged Rio more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Right, because you taught her everything! Which brings us to my first thing. Lilia, you were her teacher. How could you?” Rio’s words were laced with venom as she aimed them at Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I will stop you right there, Rio Vidal.” Lilia’s words came out harsh for the first time. “NOTHING ever happened when Agatha was underage. EVER. I didn’t ever think of her like that, and I never would.” Lilia sighed deeply as the pain of the past overtook her features. “Do you want the whole story, or do you just want to pace around and yell?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What I WANT is to cause some damage,” Rio said seriously, wishing she had the dagger she used to carry on her for SF-like emergencies.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lorna wanted to murder me, too. I’m honestly shocked she never did.” She looked at Rio, watching the gears turn in the woman’s mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Talk,” Rio said with all the restraint she could muster, “ but then I get to ask questions, and you will answer honestly. Without being cryptic.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia sat her tea down and looked past Rio, seeing the women of the past parade past her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I met Agatha when she was fourteen and I was twenty-eight. Her mother had been abusing her for years, and Agatha would do whatever she could to ruffle Evanora’s feathers.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia told her about young Agatha, the mischievous child star that terrorized anyone and everyone she could if she didn’t try to seduce them first. A menace first and Hollywood starlet second. Lilia had an encyclopedia of stories from the mundane to the absolutely absurd, and they were all very Agatha, from the hilarious to the horrifying. Lilia also explained Lorna’s plan to get her away from Evanora and where she came into it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Evanora did it for us, though. Lorna and I, that is. When she caught Agatha with another girl, she lost it with her righteous bullshit. I’ll never get over the irony of holier-than-thou Evanora Harkness turning Agatha into Lesbian Jesus. Regardless, she shot at Agatha in public, thankfully, she missed. The woman couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn if it were lit up like a Christmas tree. I happened to know a powerful attorney, and you know the rest, Agatha gained her freedom. Lorna was like a mother to her, and I was, eh,” Lilia hesitated, “an older figure.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia still felt guilty all these decades later. She had helped shape this woman, took all of Agatha’s love and trust, and thrown it away and destroyed it. Destroyed Agatha. Lorna had once called her Lilia ‘The destroyer of all that is well and good in this world’ Calderu during an argument. Lilia turned around and called her Lorna ‘Mother to all but her own child’ Wu. It was one of their nastier fights near the end of their friendship.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lorna was a mother to Agatha, but not Alice,” Rio said slowly, trying to make it make sense. Alice had yearned for more of a relationship with her mother, but understood, at least when older, that her time with Norma had been better for her. Alice was so well-adjusted and had a happy, loving childhood,  raised by Gran. Alice and Agatha were pretty close these days, and Alice was so happy for Rio. Alice had even encouraged Rio’s relationship with Agatha. Did she know the dynamics of Agatha and Lorna’s relationship? How much of any of this did Alice know? Had ALICE, her chosen sister, been lying to her? Rio pushed that thought aside, one potential traitor at a time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lorna had chosen a different life for Alice after seeing how growing up here had affected Agatha. She knew that her hopes for Alice’s life and future were incompatible with the celebrity lives they led; sex, drugs, and alcohol.  As she must have told you, Agatha was an alcoholic before she was in double digits, as were most Hollywood kids back then. And, Lorna, well, you know her story.” Lilia waved her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha was an alcoholic? I knew she partied. I didn’t know she was an alcoholic. She still drinks now, should she not?” Rio was mildly irritated that her concern for Agatha was eroding at the anger that was fueling her conversation. Lilia nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “From the time she was a kid until she was thirty-two. She quit when she started her fertility journey. I didn’t know immediately, having pushed her away as much as I could, showing her a colder vision of myself. Let’s go back…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The truth hurts, Lilia reminded herself, even to the person saying it. Yet, this was a necessary hurt today. Rio’s main concern was evident. She needed honesty after months of being lied to. Anything less would remove any chance Lilia had of staying in Rio’s good graces. And, if Lilia had any chance of returning to Agatha’s life, she had to be honest with Rio. Lilia had to overcome the survival instinct to battle what she imagined was Agatha’s narrative of the story, that of Lilia the cold-hearted villain. If Lilia wanted to manipulate this to her advantage at all, this would be the way, by not omitting anything or attempting to portray herself in a positive light.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia let the story escape, a torrent held by an age-old dam. Nothing was held back anymore. She told Rio everything, how Agatha had kissed her on her eighteenth birthday, the conversation about Agatha’s feelings, and how they decided to be casual. She told Rio about how she separated herself into two personas to keep Agatha at arm’s length. Lilia added Lorna’s take on it too, her insistence that Lilia was in the wrong and the fights it caused between the best friends.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Unable to stop the truth, Lilia talked about how the dynamic shifted after Nicky was born. Although it had been clear that there were no second chances, she continued the cruel demeanor to focus Agatha away from her. After all, she was, wasn’t she?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And that’s where we are today,” Lilia finished, eyes puffy from crying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio ran a hand over her face. Thoughts fluttered around her brain, making it difficult to pin one down for long. But her emotions stayed strong. Rio was livid and conflicted. Her heart ached for Agatha and Lilia in completely different ways. It made her want to stay and comfort or run far away.  These situations were just so fucking convoluted. One thing was clear to her. She couldn’t imagine losing Alice because one of them had made such a stupid life choice. To endure this crazy life and do so alone and without forgiveness and closure from your best friend. It was heartbreaking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This whole thing was messy. It was complicated. It was a psychological drama Rio wasn’t sure she wanted to play a part in anymore. Still, Rio was never one to stand down when justice needed to be done.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What the fuck, Lilia? There is so much to unpack here. I don’t know where to start.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Give it a shot,” Lilia said with tired cynicism, “I’ve heard or thought it all.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha trusted you! You were supposed to be a safe person for her! You were one of two people that she had in this world and you didn’t just fuck her over, you actually fucked her. You KNEW better, Lilia! So WHAT if she was a consenting adult, or mature? She was still a kid compared to you, Lilia. One of your two best friends! Lorna was a much better woman than I am.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio paced the room, fists clenched. Yes, it took two people to get into the situation, but Agatha had been young, and it had been Lilia’s job, no, her duty, to shut the whole thing down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lorna was a better woman than all of us,” Lilia corrected. “I regret what I did to Agatha and how. I took a moment of weakness and stretched it for a decade. I destroyed myself, Agatha, and the family we built in the process. Each one of us had a vice, and somehow, mine turned out to be the most damaging. I suspected from the beginning I wasn’t the person for Agatha, but I selfishly thought maybe it could work out. I deluded myself that I was balancing it well, jumping between two personalities with her, warmly loving and coldly distant.  It didn’t work as well as I had thought, and Agatha had cried, god, I don’t know how many times to Lorna, who affectionately called me a ‘bipolar bitch.’ It wasn’t just a bad situation, it was a disaster, and I was too blind to see it or what it did to me. I completely lost sight of who I was, and every word said under that other version of me made me hate myself, too. I’ve never been able to forgive myself.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia looked down at the floor, her eyes following patterns in the wood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What about Nicky? You didn’t want him, so why bother treating him with such favoritism?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had stopped pacing for a moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He’s a part of Agatha, and that makes him special. Just as Agatha will always be special to me, I will always love her, Rio. Not the way you do, no, but the way I have always loved her,”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio jumped in, “The way you always loved her? Like you still want to sleep with her?” Rio’s face was one of utter disgust.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia’s face did not change. “No, Rio, I do not want to sleep with Agatha, that is not a part of it. As I was saying, I also care about all our students. But I will go further to protect Nicky and the twins out of loyalty to Agatha, Wanda, and, most importantly, Lorna.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “WANDA!” Rio remembered the good-hearted redhead with an inability to keep secrets, realization dawning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She must not know any of this! Does she even know what truly happened to Lorna?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I doubt it. One great thing Agatha picked up from Lorna is a protective streak. With that, and Agatha’s maturity beyond her years, she sheltered Wanda from all that she could.  Agatha swooped in and has always tried to take away Wanda’s pain from the atrocities of genocidal war and then an exploitative family member. Agatha immediately got Wanda into therapy once she got Wanda away from her aunt. If Wanda will ever tell you about those first few weeks at Agatha’s, let her. It will give you more insight into Wanda and why she has let Agatha lead and guide her for so long. But I digress.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia finished the now cold tea as she tried to remember where she was going with that last story and looked at Rio. “You’re conflicted.” She stated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No shit,” Rio replied. “On the one hand, the ex Agatha told me about is this awful, terrible, cold, and unfeeling woman…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She was,” Lilia confirmed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s face twisted as she looked at Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But, you’re not. You’re Lilia. You care about these kids, especially the boys. You hate injustice, you get nervous over a teacher going into labor, and you worry about students getting glitter in their eyes. You want what’s best for former friends, you give women second chances, and you watch over your former best friend's daughter. Alice told me about the advice you gave her about Jen. You warned me about keeping Wanda’s secrets. The Lilia Calderu I know, cryptic and shady though she may be, is not the woman of Agatha’s past.” Rio didn’t know what to do or really what to think, about anyone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There’s a lot of shady characters around here, my dear.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You and Agatha, primarily,” Rio said, looking at the floor as she had a thought. “Lilia, why did you bring me here? Don’t give me the bullshit about teaching or because of Alice, why did you really bring me here?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew the answer but needed to hear it straight from the source.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do not discount my support for Alice and her moment of need. But, yes, I also saw two broken women who could support each other. With what I knew of that little wild coven, it would be inevitable if you came back with us.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia waited for Rio’s reaction, knowing it could go a myriad of ways, really hoping anger wasn’t the one Rio chose, but knowing too well that her cards were upside down at this point.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chose anger.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “WHAT?! You tried to set us up?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No. Words have meaning, my dear. I said you could support each other. I didn’t expect all of this to happen, though part of me always hopes for the best for Agatha, in love as well. I only want her to be happy and for Nicky to be surrounded by love. Everything else? All of that was more than I could hope for, but I would do it over and over if I knew the results would be the same.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      All Rio heard was how Lilia had set them up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You KNEW I had a stalker, and you put them in harm's way to make up for the pain you caused her? That’s selfish, Lilia!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was moving faster now, careful not to trip over her own two feet as she wore a path in the wooden flooring. Lilia’s eyes followed Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, a stalker. Not a crazy, psychopath who would follow you across the state! I didn’t know Lou would completely lose it, and neither did you. I certainly didn’t know she’d go after Nicky. I would have never let it get that far.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You weren’t at the hospital when he got injured,” Rio spat out the accusation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not that you were aware of, sure. I told Wanda not to wake either of you or tell you I was there. Anytime Nicky or the twins hurt themselves, I am in the shadows. Don’t underestimate me, Vidal. You’re losing focus.” Lilia reminded her with a slight smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This is too much,” Rio shook her head. “You were a monster and shattered her. Now,  you’re what, trying to redeem yourself? You bring me here, effectively putting her in danger, Agatha and I fall in love, what do you get? Absolution of your sins?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s mind was reeling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My sins are my own, and I have to live with those, with what I did and what my actions caused. I lost my family because of what I did, Rio. All the money and notoriety in the world can’t replace that, and it was a hard lesson to learn. I went from being a planet in someone’s solar system to a monster lurking in the shadows.” Lilia was willing Rio to understand, without a side of anger.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had stopped making her laps in Lilia’s front room. It was late, and her energy was fading. “So this was your idea to what, to return to dwarf planet status, Pluto?” Rio had her hands on her hips, her hard expression returning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Something like that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia finally stood, walking back to the kitchen to put away the now empty teacup—more to keep herself busy than anything else. Rio was shaking, though she wasn’t sure whether it was from convoluted emotions, adrenaline, or shock.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is this your entire redemption arc, Lilia? Restore love to Agatha’s life and maybe, just maybe, find your way back in, because I may not allow that to happen, purely out of protection. What if I don’t trust you anymore?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia scoffed, rinsing the cup and placing it on the drainboard, turning to face Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You don’t have a malicious bone in your body. Norma raised you better. It’s why Lou is still breathing and why I’m still standing. If Agatha didn’t want me here, I wouldn’t be, and you won’t go against Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You also won’t hurt Alice, and
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       she
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      still sees the good in me. Alice is the one who called me to you, in case you’ve forgotten. She is the one that gave me the idea to bring you here, and it’s already crossed your mind how much she’s withheld.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio quickly looked away. Lilia was, after all, the master at reading people.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did my career amount to anything in your principal Calderu eyes? Or was it merely my trauma and relationship with Alice?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was floundering.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course it did. I wasn’t letting an unqualified teacher around my kids. I may be kooky, Rio, but I’m not certifiable. I do have some standards.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For the first time during their conversation, Lilia felt slightly offended. Rio shook her head, walking back through the living room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This conversation isn’t over, Lilia. I don’t know what to think. I don’t know who you are anymore. I’m confused about my feelings. I have no idea what’s real and what was manipulated. I need the week, Lilia, I won’t be in.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio headed for the door as Lilia caught her arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, wait, just hang on for a minute.” Lilia dropped her hand and went to where keys were hanging by the door, taking one on a triple moon keyring and writing down an address in the Sierra Nevada region.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Go home, get some sleep, drive up in the morning. It’s a good place to do some thinking. Lorna and Agatha did a lot of…retreats there. I know things aren’t okay, and I know they aren’t okay with us. I’ll take care of work, and you go clear your head. As for Agatha, a couple of things. Her drinking is under control, and she has a small Army of friends to pull her away from most bad situations. But, lastly, and most importantly, I can bring people together Rio, but I can’t make them fall in love. You have every right to be mad at me, and if you burn down the cabin, I deserve it. But don’t take it out on Agatha, don’t shut her out, and don’t cause her pain like I did.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For the first time, Lilia actually looked her age, and older.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No one is even slightly capable of doing what you did, Swords,” Rio retorted as she took the key and address and closed the door firmly behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had gone in, guns a-blazin’, and came out surrounded by ghosts. Calling Lilia Swords was what Rio had needed to remind her that this woman had hurt Agatha all those years ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia could only smirk at the nickname as she watched Rio through the glass in the door. Confirming the rumor of the tattoo and recalling something Lorna had once said before
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Witches’ Road
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      had even been written.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You’re not taking a knife to her heart, Lilia, you’re taking a sword to it.”

     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was after midnight when Rio entered her apartment and turned on the light. Her eyes automatically landed on the flowers on the coffee table and the opened spiral. She picked it up and sat on the couch, reading the note from Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       My Love,

</p>
<p>

<span>
       Yes, Lilia is my ex. Please give me a chance to explain after you hear her side of the story. I love you so much, and I do not want to lose you.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had even left her boutonniere from the reception lying next to the letter. Rio put her head in her hands and sobbed. When she finally stopped, she dragged herself to the shower, sitting on the floor as the hot water washed away her tears and thinking about her next move. She had a lot to process, and thanks to Lilia, the root cause of most of this, she had a fortress of solitude awaiting her escape. Still, her thoughts scattered like the water around her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She needed Alice, but she couldn’t ruin this time for her and Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice might also have been keeping secrets all these years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hadn’t felt this alone since before she had crossed foot into Norma Wu’s house. Even on her own in San Francisco, she could call Alice and talk to her. Meet up on the weekends.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Oh, Wanda. Poor Wanda, too. Someone else who would just be crushed. She would have to wait for Wanda to reach out to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio lay in her bed, having transitioned from her shower to the comfort of her blankets, and emotional support Raven curled on her stomach as she let out a harsh laugh. This damn situation was so convoluted because Agatha was at the center of this little lesbian universe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, she would do as Lilia had instructed, wouldn’t she? Get some sleep, because deep down, Rio knew it was the best thing to do. Not because Lilia had suggested it but because it was the smart thing to do.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She would pack, leave a note for Alice to take Raven to Nicky, and flee to the cabin in the mountains.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maybe she would burn it down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After all, she did feel like causing some damage.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lilia. It was Lilia?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s face drained of color, a feat for the already fair-skinned redhead. Then, it contorted to hurt as the realization of the past nearly thirty years crept in. Lilia and Lorna had been such a force, their friendship stood solid through everything, and they had been there through everything. Lilia had always been there for them, and then suddenly, she hadn’t been there as much. Then, she had more to do with Wanda, and by extension, Nat. Not as much with Agatha. Wanda hadn’t known what had happened. All she remembered from those years was the inherent sadness that never left Lorna’s eyes and how her emotions flared and tears flowed if anyone even mentioned Lilia.  Her heart ached for their friendship, derailed by horrid decisions and poor life choices. Wanda couldn’t imagine losing Agatha’s presence like that, and the mere thought made her eyes well up with tears once more. Lilia had brought Wanda so much hope when she came to visit the hospital on the day of Nicky’s birth, thinking things would be all right again, but nothing came of it. Which again sent a wave of sadness over her now as it had years ago. Wanda knew Lilia would have been over the moon for Lorna’s sobriety had she been made aware.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had all been so proud of Lorna.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then she and Agatha did that movie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lorna relapsed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lorna died.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The memory of the days surrounding her death made her eyes sting again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They all moved on, honoring Lorna with the best lives they could lead and raising their sons in a happy and stable home. Then, it came time to send the boys to school, and Agatha insisted on SHIELD. Wanda was elated to have Lilia back, if even on the periphery of their small family. That’s when she could see Agatha and Lilia's relationship begin to thaw slowly.  It was one of the reasons Wanda was so insistent on becoming the ultimate school moms. The parties, the functions, everything. She so badly wanted to rebuild their group’s old dynamic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn’t just for Agatha, who would never admit to needing Lilia around. Wanda had needed Lilia back in almost the same way that Lilia needed them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda turned to Nat, not quite looking at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’ve kept secrets for Agatha, did you know?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat shook her head. “No, this is one she didn’t let me in on either.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked up at Agatha, eyes searching.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They were our friends too. Missed holidays, birthdays, and milestones. It was our family. Agatha, you had no right to decide for us.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded, something darker rolling across her face and into her tremulous voice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I get wanting to have secrets, but why didn’t you tell me? Me, Aggie. I told you everything, every time. I thought it was mutual. You’re my sister, for god's sake! You know what I mean. And it isn’t just one secret now like you always said. Not just the identity of your ex. But, also the two biggest losses and moments in your life before Nicky and I never knew a thing. I didn’t even suspect something was wrong. Why didn’t you trust me with these and let me be there for you? Pregnancy, miscarriage, stood up at the altar… what the hell, Aggie!” The words tumbled out of her. Wanda felt as though she had been stabbed in the back repeatedly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at Wanda with the same sisterly look as always, “You were filming overseas, I wasn’t going to burden you, I -”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “NO!” Wanda shouted and jumped up, startling both of the other women. “NO! You don’t get to do that. I wasn’t a little girl, Agatha! I wasn’t then, and I’m not now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But, Agatha, I so badly wanted and still want to be there for you, for everything. I was honored to be in that delivery room the day Nicky was born. I gladly would have let you break my hand that day. Every scandal when I got to be there by your side and handle something the way you taught me to was when I finally got to be the person that Agatha Harkness was for me. Now, I find out that you kept two of your darkest moments from me? So I was not able to be there as I should have been and so wished to be. Aggie, I am just devastated.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tears were dripping from Wanda’s chin and jaw. Nat sat beside her on the couch, also crying, but holding Wanda’s hand. She looked up at Wanda, nodding in agreement and resisting the urge to put her arms around Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wiped her face with the sleeve of her shirt, which was covered in tears and snot, despite having changed just a little while earlier.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t want to cloud your judgment now by telling you who, and back then, I didn’t want to bother you with everything you had -”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This time, it was Nat who interrupted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We aren’t an excuse to use, Agatha. We all knew what we were doing, and Wanda did a damn good job at balancing us with everything else.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I would’ve been back here immediately. Lilia being your ex doesn’t cloud my judgment now, and it wouldn’t have then. This was something you did for you, not us. I am capable of talking to someone and separating their past indiscretions. You wanted to maintain control and the facade of your life. We can call it a lesson you picked up in your youth. But, that control would have cracked had you tried to reconcile the truth with the facade you presented. Yes, it was complicated, but Lilia was a big part of all our lives. And whether you want to admit it or not, you needed her back in your life when Lorna died. You chose to go through so much on your own when you had me, us, and probably her too.” Wanda gestured. “All you had to do was tell us.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took a moment to breathe. Her words marinated in Agatha’s head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio is good for you, the best really. But, it’s not all about having a perfect partner.” Wanda looked at her hand in Nat’s before reaching out with the other to Agatha. “You also need the old Lilia to fill a different role. Stop thinking of her as your ex. That woman is long gone, and you know deep down that she is.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha did not reach for Wanda’s outstretched hand, unconsciously taking a step back instead and causing another wave of sorrow to hit Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, God! I’m so over the manipulations and the betrayal! Nearly THIRTY years of it. How can I trust you, that this is all of it, that you’re not holding back anything else important?” Wanda looked away from Agatha, her bottom lip quivering.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was never supposed to be the one being betrayed, Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned forward, her head dropping. She knew that the hardest challenge still lay ahead, and she dreaded having to add salt to Wanda’s emotional wounds tonight. She hated the feeling of causing pain to the person she swore to protect.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Yet, Agatha still had to tell her how Lorna died. Not the fabricated story that she had reiterated so many times over the years it almost felt like a truth of its own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was also the letter Lorna had written for Wanda, too. Agatha had never given it to her, not because she didn’t want to, but because it had specific instructions:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       When Wanda and Nat get married.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Or 15 years from now (2/27/26),
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       whichever comes first.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
      She assumed that Lorna had written it in that letter. Lorna had a flair for the dramatic, but no, she needed to tell Wanda now, before she did any more damage.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re right, Wanda. There’s more I need to tell you. But this one was not exactly my secret.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She raised her eyes to meet Wanda’s scrutinizing gaze, knowing this was going to deal a harsh blow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You might want to sit down.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda didn’t sit down. Instead, she remained standing, knowing she might end up bolting out of the door and sprinting across the compound. Nat stood, taking up a protective stance next to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha blinked back tears and drew a shaky breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please know that Lorna didn’t want anyone to know, but she never relapsed. She remained sober.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The confusion instantly hit both redheads.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then what happened? Agatha, we know what substance abuse looks like. Lorna looked so bad at the end. She looked…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It clicked for both of them at that moment as she looked at Nat. Where Nat accepted it with a silent nod, Wanda let out an ear-splitting scream.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “NO! She was clean, she was sober, she was vibrant! WHY?! Why did this happen to her? Why didn’t you tell us?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda wasn’t really standing as much as Nat was holding her up as she relived that night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lorna didn’t want anyone to pity her, didn’t want to become some sob story or martyr. She was down to the last few weeks, days really. And, went out on her own terms at that party we were all at, and you know the rest.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had relived the memory so many times over the years. It was a piece of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda clung to Nat as she let the initial shock subside and stood straight. There was time for rehashed grief later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “In hiding all of this, you did more damage than good. Once more your secrets and manipulations hurt us all. We deserved to be there for Lorna and for you. We deserved to mourn and honor her.  Lilia isn’t the only one that’s been playing two different people, Agatha. She may have started the demolition, but you kept it going.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She motioned to Nat for them to go as she looked back at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have to think some things over. You know we’ll be okay in a few days because that’s what family does, Agatha. They forgive each other, no matter the transgressions or duration. Ironically, it was you and Lorna who taught me that. Just give me some space to process this.” She paused a moment. “I just hope Rio can forgive you. If Alice knew ANY of this and didn’t tell Rio, then may God have mercy on her soul.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Hand-in-hand, Nat and Wanda walked out of Agatha’s house. Wanda would absolutely forgive Agatha in a few days. She wouldn’t let this come between them. There would be scars, but she saw how haunted Lilia still was to this day, and she would not make those same mistakes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the hurt redheads returned to their house, Wanda turned to Nat as they buried themselves in each other’s arms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How do you manage to remain so stoic and not completely lose it?” Wanda sniffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Some training never leaves you, but also, I had a hand in Lorna’s death,” Nat whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda pulled back and looked up at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What? But she chose that herself, you had nothing to do with that unless you gave her the…” Wanda looked at her in horror and stepped back. Nat ran a hand through her hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t give her anything! She came to me asking about certain pills and medications. I assumed it was for a role, and I answered her. Just like I would you. I gave her the names of some people from whom she could get more information. She asked me if I used to carry things on me, and I told her I still did for…trickier situations I occasionally find myself in involving you two. Stalkers, if anyone is ever kidnapped, any possible revenge; you know, the shadier side.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha Harkness was not your normal, run-of-the-mill celebrity.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded, not liking where this was going. Nat crossed her arms, tears gathering at the rims of her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I did not tell her where I kept anything; she was clever,” Nat smiled. “ It was Lorna, she had known me for fourteen years and had a hand in forming me. She knew how to get into my house. She knew all my secret hiding places, the secret panels. A few days after she died, I had a suspicion, and I checked. It was all missing, with a note that said, ‘I’m so sorry, you’ll learn why one day. I love you, Nat. Take good care of them, especially Wanda.’”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The tears had spilled over as she looked at Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am so sorry, Wanda.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The sleeves of Wanda’s shirt were permanently tear-stained, she was sure. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat couldn’t meet her eyes. “To protect you,” she whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was done.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am NOT a child that needs protecting! I wasn’t then, and I’m not now! You’re sleeping on the couch.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned on her heel and stomped up the stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had just stood and stared after Wanda and Nat. Her hands had dropped to her sides, and she truly did not know what to do with herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was losing people quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her phone dinged, Nat had installed the tracking app for the necklace. Rio had just left Lilia’s. Agatha huffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Alright, you old bat, time for us to do this,” she said aloud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She swore she heard Lorna’s laughter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sailed into Lilia’s house as though she belonged there, locking the door behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I see you were expecting me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha noticed a mug of black coffee on the coffee table as she settled in the old armchair beside it, the one that had always been her favorite. It was still just as comfortable.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You should keep the door locked. You never know what shady characters will come in, present company excluded, of course.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked down at the wooden floor and noticed a burn mark, a memory of a time she had missed the ashtray. Lilia walked in from the kitchen with a new cup of tea.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s two in the morning, and you’re the second dark-haired lesbian in my house tonight. I think I’ll take my chances.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I take it things didn’t go well,” Agatha concluded, pushing away the memories of her time spent here. In the past, the two women had at least kept their activities relegated to different spaces. This house held the better memories - the memories of family. There were arguments, especially near the end, sure. However, this house mostly reminded Agatha of who and what she lost and she realized she was losing her anger quickly, even though she was trying to hold on to it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m alive, so it could have been much worse. Have you heard from her?” Lilia quirked a brow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, and I don’t think I will for at least a day or so. She lied to me about coming here. She told me she was at her apartment while I was physically standing there, so that’s where we are with that. Did you orchestrate this? Don’t tell me you didn’t. You know better than to meddle in the affairs of a Harkness.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could have sworn she saw ghosts of their younger selves everywhere. Agatha had crossed her legs at the knees and held her mug at her lips. Lilia sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You and I both know that I am not the woman I was all those years before.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia’s eyes met Agatha’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Maybe not completely, but there’s still that Calderu manipulation there. That was always a staple. Half-truths, cryptic advice, the ultimate mastermind.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took a sip of her coffee, her gaze steady.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, and you are my protege, don’t forget that,” Lilia reminded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked away at that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The question still stands,” Agatha replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I brought her here because she would be a great fit at SHIELD, Alice needed her, and she would also fill gaping wounds.” Lilia studied Agatha’s reaction carefully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fifty-one, and you’re still trying to control my life,” Agatha barked, though they both knew there was no real bite to it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I just want what’s best for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The anger in Agatha attempted to shove forward with that admission. “What’s best for me? WHAT’S BEST FOR ME?! Was staring at me for three hours after I told you I miscarried, what was best for me? Was leaving me at the altar what was best for me? Was using me for ten years? Don’t tell me what’s best for me, Lilia. Actually, it’s about time we have this heart-to-heart, isn’t it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia settled into the sofa, her face soft after the wave of verbal blows from Agatha. Agatha paused, chest heaving after her release.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I couldn’t process it, Agatha.” Lilia began. “There was so much going on with me and in my head. I had lost my ability to have children and had barely worked through that. I was so concerned and worried for you and your future. I knew you needed comfort, and at the same time, not from me. Yet, I mourned for you inwardly. As cold as I was to you, I felt it all rage within me. I had compartmentalized completely until I disassociated from everything and everyone. The two people I had become warred with one another, as was so frequent for me then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My first instinct was to hold you, Agatha. It always was. The night you told me you were in love with me? I wanted to console you, kiss you, hold you. All of the times that widened the gap between us? I never wanted to cause the divide to begin with, but I knew I wasn’t that person for you either, Agatha. I could have tried, but it would have ended with even less chance of any reconciliation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I couldn’t let you end your career, Agatha. Not when you sacrificed so much and worked so hard, look at all the good you’ve done! We both know that neither of us would have been happy, and I never meant to use you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had expected a verbal fistfight. She didn’t expect Lilia to roll over this easily, and she certainly didn’t expect the venom to be drained from her own proverbial fangs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked at Lilia, skeptically. This had to be a ruse of some type. A power play or manipulation. This was not the ruthless Don Calderu she had known. Yet, the realization of the truth also stung.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Your first instinctual reaction to me confessing my love for you was to console me?” Agatha shook her head, scoffing aloud. “I guess I never really understood our dynamic and you are one fucked up lady.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The shock on Lilia’s face and the reversal of the conversation energized Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, what then? Why are you confessing everything now? Not even arguing or defending yourself? This is not like you.” Agatha’s arms were crossed tightly against her chest as she scrutinized Lilia’s every movement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia placed her tea on the table next to a scratch caused by a glass pipe long ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lorna was my friend too,” She said softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt as though Lilia had screamed it. Again, she felt that age-old hurt of coming second to Lorna in Lilia’s eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lorna told me for ten years to end it, that I was breaking you, little by little, yet I kept on. Kept convincing myself that you were an adult, kept trying to prove to her that I wasn’t wrong. I was technically correct, but I still should have ended it or never let it begin in the first place. You were my vice, and I became the worst of the three of us. You and Lorna stayed true to who you were. In the end, I left you, unrecognizable, and I lost my best friends and my family, in the process.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia’s face showed the worry of someone who had experienced great loss. Not the carefully constructed mask she had worn for so long.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I should have been there with you, Aggi...Agatha.” She stopped herself from using the nickname Lorna had given Agatha all those lifetimes ago. “I should have been there the whole time, the treatments, the appointments, at the end. Supporting you. I know you didn’t tell Wanda, she and Nat were one of the worst-kept secrets in Hollywood, and she wouldn’t have been able to keep Lorna’s secret. You did it all alone, and you shouldn’t have had to.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had moved to be closer to Agatha and tentatively put a hand on Agatha’s knee. Agatha stared at Lilia’s hand, which she had known so well, that had brought her comfort and pleasure and was now offering comfort again. It was also offering a bridge back to something more familiar.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha covered Lilia’s hand with hers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I told Wanda everything tonight.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She spoke around the lump in her throat. She had wanted to say other things, lash out at Lilia for not being there, and continue to shift the blame. She couldn’t do it anymore. Lilia’s honesty had disarmed her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Manipulative bitch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, Agatha, how did she take it?” Lilia asked. Her voice was that of the caring, loving Lilia from long ago. The Lilia that Agatha had so desperately needed since Lorna died.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not well,” Agatha sniffed. “She said that I also turned into two people, and she’s right. I betrayed the person I swore to protect,” Realization dawned on Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh my gods, Lilia. I didn't screw her, but I sure as hell screwed her over…fuck,” Agatha was going over everything in her mind. She
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       was
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      two different people, and in some of the same ways, she had done to Wanda what Lilia had done to her. “I kept telling myself that it wasn’t my secret to tell. Lorna left a letter for her to open when she and Nat either got married or fifteen years later. I told myself I was protecting her.” Agatha looked at Lilia with tired, watery eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ah yes, Lorna’s letters. I received an envelope of them in the mail the day after she died. I told myself I was trying to protect you and keep our friendship intact. As you can see, it did not work. As for Wanda, she isn’t that scared little girl anymore.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s exactly what she said, and then I covered a secret for Nat, so that’s going to make things worse, and there’s still Rio. She hates me, doesn’t she? I’ve lost my sister, two of them really, and the love of my life because I don’t know how to tell the truth, and I wish I could blame you, but I can’t.” Agatha saw Lilia in a different light.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      If Agatha keeping secrets from Wanda did major damage, wouldn’t she do whatever it took to stay in Wanda’s life? To repair things between Wanda and Nat? The things Nat had were for one specific purpose and didn’t count as drugs in her eyes. Nat had zero ill intentions and never suspected that Lorna would do what she did. She had come to Agatha as soon as she had discovered them missing, and Agatha had been the one to tell her not to tell Wanda. She would shoulder all the blame for it if she needed to. They had finally gotten engaged. They were finally getting married. Agatha wouldn’t let anything come in between that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Isn’t that what Lorna and Lilia had always done?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia would always be there for the boys, Agatha, Wanda, and Nat, if they ever needed her. And Agatha had been playing the Lilia card all year to get Rio, and occasionally Alice, out of work, hadn’t she?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had shed the Swords persona long ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had developed one of her own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Now, Agatha was paying for it, and she had blamed Lilia for it this whole time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have to talk to Rio.” Agatha stood up abruptly and lost her balance. Lilia pulled her back down to sit before she fell over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No. I gave her the key to the cabin so I could keep an eye on her and know where to send you. She’s going to find out that Alice knew, and her heart will absolutely shatter. I also knew you would come clean with Wanda soon, and she would turn to Rio. Wanda will probably go with her if she catches her early enough. You and Nat can head up in a day or so. I’ll give Alice time off when she needs it. You should probably make sure Jen and Vision are ready to be on kid duty.” Lilia laid it all out, the mastermind at work.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Our family has everything, doesn’t it? Drama, generational trauma, so many lesbians…” Agatha was trying to make jokes like she always did, but her heart wasn’t in it. “Am I going to lose her?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia thought about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not if you’re honest, and I do mean completely. If I can learn how to tell the truth, you can too.” Lilia leaned in and patted her shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled and gave a small laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know that’s a manipulation technique, Lils. I am, after all, the Luke to your Yoda.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia’s heart stopped at the old nickname as she stared at Agatha, who had looked away when she realized what she had said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t make a big deal out of it, okay?” She scoffed, looking back at the other woman.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Says the woman who expressly put nicknames off limits.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you blame me? I was still hurt, and I still am, but things have been somewhat repaired, and Rio has been integral to that. I cannot lose her, Lilia,” she reiterated. “I know that now. How long do I give it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re looking at me now? For relationship advice?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I mean, you’ve done pretty well so far…” Agatha smiled at the absurdity of it all.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’ll know. Don’t make the same mistakes I did, okay, kid?” Lilia squeezed Agatha’s hand. Both of them had done entirely too much crying tonight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before Agatha could overthink it, she moved from the armchair to Lilia’s side, wrapping her arms around her, and cried on her shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were sixteen and thirty again, the self-inflicted orphan and the gay aunt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had memorized the letters Lorna had written to her. She hadn’t opened them all, as some had explicit instructions. But the one she had opened on her fifty-first birthday nearly a year ago when she turned the same age Lorna had been when she had died was explicit:
     </span>

       I know you’re freaking out this year because it’s the age I died at. If you have yet  to forgive Lilia, it’s time. You know you need her.

</p>

      Wanda hadn’t slept well. How could she? She knew Nat had left, either to the Clubhouse, Agatha’s, The Beachhouse, hell, maybe even Tahoe. At that moment, she didn’t care that much. She had never been this upset with Natasha. To sit on a secret for thirteen years, and one this big? How dare she! Nat had never kept something like this from her, and she certainly had never told anything more than a white lie to Wanda. Something like ‘of course it tastes fine burnt, sunshine.’ Wanda couldn’t imagine staying there right now, and she knew one person she could talk to about all of this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had also been hurt, albeit much worse, by Agatha. Wanda still didn’t know how much Alice knew and preemptively hurt for Rio in that regard. She needed to talk to Rio, and going to her apartment sounded like a good idea.

<p>
<span>
      to come?

</p>
<p>
<span>
      We can be miserable together?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thought it would be nice to have another person with her, someone to talk everything out with. Someone Agatha had also betrayed. She couldn’t imagine how Wanda felt. Probably the same way she was going to feel once she talked to Alice and confirmed her suspicions.
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      quite some time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I’ll take you up on that.

<span>
      Yes. Meet at your place at ten
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      this morning?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda glanced at the clock. It was seven, and they had plenty of time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded silently to herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Rio:

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sounds great.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      See you then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I’ll bring the wine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda quickly sent Vision a message asking if he could take the boys for a few days, and he agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Instead of leaving a note for Nicky on Alice’s door, Rio texted him about Raven, and he was excited, although a little confused about why he needed to take care of Raven. He would pick her up later that day, probably after Rio and Wanda left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hugged Wanda when she arrived before loading her luggage into the car.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You don’t exactly pack lightly, Maximoff,” she joked as Wanda smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Have you talked to Alice?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s mouth was a thin line as she shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m afraid to. What if she did know?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda put a hand on her friend’s shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then we face it together, and I’m here to get you through it. Let’s go cry, drink, and potentially cause trouble in the mountains.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was grateful for the other woman in the car. Already her heart felt lighter. Even in what felt like her darkest moments of this year, she had never been alone. The hurt was still there, but the love that surrounded her, here, and she knew, in Agatha’s heart too, comforted her nonetheless.

      It was Wanda’s turn to drive as they talked about the revelations of the past eighteen hours and how they were feeling about everything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I feel so stupid, believing I was exempt from Agatha’s betrayal,” Wanda began. “I mean, small lies and omissions, sure. Not big things like this, though. Then Nat kept something from me on top of all of it? Nat has NEVER lied to me apart from things like ‘no sunshine, I’m not getting you anything for your birthday’, or ‘no honey, I didn’t eat the last of the ice cream, it was Tommy’. Tommy doesn’t even like pistachio ricotta cheesecake ice cream!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was waving wildly with one hand and barely keeping her other on the steering wheel as they headed north.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, welcome to this side of your sister. Sorry, it’s your first time.” Rio deadpanned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She felt terrible that Wanda was having to experience it, yet in the short time she had known Agatha, and the even shorter time she had been with her, this seemed to be a reoccurring event, and she hated it. Yes, Rio had kept things from Agatha, but she had made a concerted effort not to do that any longer after the Lou fiasco.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Yes, Rio had slept with a sociopathic jewel thief, thought for a millisecond she was still in love with her, and briefly considered going back before she realized the manipulation techniques’ effects. However, she had made it very clear to both Agatha and Lou that she no longer wanted anything to do with Lou Falco. She very much wanted to see her dead, and Lilia was right when she said Norma had raised her better than that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then there was Agatha. Agatha had slept with Rio’s boss for a whole decade. Rio didn’t know her back then, but it still felt strange, especially knowing that Lilia had acted as a puppet master to some extent. To her, it was very much like a sapphic Lifetime movie. She still needed to process and maybe even talk to Lilia more. She especially wanted to hear stories of a young Agatha. If they ever got to a comfortable sharing point, that is.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sorry she’s been doing it to you this whole time,” Wanda was saying as she looked between the road and Rio. “How long are you going to hold it against her?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Wanda. “How long are you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky had Agatha’s key to Rio’s apartment and was opening the door to get Raven as Alice and Jen were leaving theirs. They had another week until they moved onto the compound and were in full-on packing mode. Alice was confused upon seeing Nicky, as he usually didn’t come over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, what are you doing over here?” She asked with a friendly smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hi Alice, hi Jen.” Nicky smiled back. “I’m keeping Raven this week. Rio’s going out of town, I think, though I’m not sure why.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Confusion crossed his face as he hoped these two women would give him answers, though they seemed just as confused as he was. The newlyweds looked at each other, an unasked question passing between them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t know she was going anywhere,” Alice answered, unsure why Rio hadn’t asked her to keep the centuries-old feline.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha and Wanda have to work this week, and you guys return to school. I don’t know what’s going on.” Jen added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky raised his eyebrows in growing concern. “Billy and Tommy are with Uncle Vision this week. Aunt Wanda went with Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What about your mom and Aunt Nat?” Jen asked, trying to decipher just how difficult her job was about to become.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky shook his head. “Aunt Nat left the compound last night. Billy and Tommy think their moms got into an argument, and then mom didn’t come home until this morning. I think Mom did something stupid again, but my aunts never argue, so it must be really bad, and clearly, they have forgotten their communication techniques.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky bent down to pick up Raven, who had come into the hall to investigate and rubbed her in between the ears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio does stupid things too, Nicky,” Alice said in defense of Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky put Raven’s head to his chest and tried to cover both of her ears. “Don’t talk about her mother like that in front of her,” he gasped.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen tried to hide her smile. For a kid who wanted nothing to do with acting, he had his mother’s natural talent.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m going to call Rio and find out what’s going on. You take good care of the cat-god there.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice turned on her heel and went back into the apartment, already calling Rio. Jen shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have a feeling my blood pressure is going to be very high this week.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She waved to Nicky and followed her wife back inside. Nicky looked down at Raven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Let’s get your stuff packed up, and then you can tell me everything you goddess, you,” he scratched between her ears as he walked into the house, Raven meowing the whole time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice knew something was horribly wrong. Rio hadn’t stayed late at the reception yesterday, she hadn’t even given Alice a goodbye hug or an ‘I love you’—something they always did. Yes, Alice and Jen were celebrating their marriage, but Alice would always make time for Rio, no matter what.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She thought Rio felt the same way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That old familiar pang of jealousy slowly crept up on Alice, and she had to bat it away mentally. It was something she had dealt with after her mother had died and the real reason she couldn’t move out to Los Angeles immediately. She had to work through a lot in therapy before she could be within striking distance of Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Now, as she waited for Rio to pick up, she was reminded that the feeling was reappearing, and once again, Agatha Harkness was responsible. It went to voicemail, and Alice hung up, not leaving one. She looked up at Jen, worried. “Maybe there’s no service where they’re at right now?” Alice looked to Jen for reassurance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course, love, I’m sure everything is fine.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen took Alice into her arms and held her against her. She didn’t know what was going on, but her senses told her nothing good. The only person who ever saw this soft side of Jen was Alice, and she would deny she even had one until the day she died.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked at Rio as Rio stared at her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You have to call her back. You know she’s going to worry, and she doesn’t even know what’s going on. Put it on the Bluetooth.” The redhead instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio bit the inside of her bottom lip before replying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What if I’m right? What if she did know?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then you have to talk through it, Rio. You can’t just let it fester.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda spoke from recent experience. Rio sighed and called back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice jumped as her phone rang, and she removed herself from her wife’s arms, answering and putting the call on speaker. She heard the undeniable sounds that signaled car Bluetooth. Wanda was listening.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey,” Alice answered, not sure what she should ask first.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked nervously at Wanda. “Hey, sorry, you popped up as a missed call. I guess we were going through a dead spot.” It was all she could say.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked at Jen, clearly confused. This was not like Rio. Alice decided to get straight to the point and sat down, Jen taking her place by her side, running her hand through Alice’s hair, calming her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We saw Nicky getting Raven. He said you and Wanda are headed up to the mountains. What’s going on, Ri?” Alice asked, her voice shaky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio inhaled deeply through her nose and exhaled through her mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda and I are heading to a cabin in the mountains so we can do some thinking,” She said slowly, not sure how much she should say.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice was even more confused. “What happened?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Last night at the reception, I heard a conversation someone was having and started looking for them. I found out who Agatha’s ex is, and it’s Lilia.” Rio waited for Alice’s reaction and reply. Just
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       how much had Alice actually known?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice’s and Jen’s eyes went wide as they looked at each other. They had their suspicions, but to have it confirmed was something different entirely.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lilia!? Jesus! Well, that at least makes sense now that I think about it. Have you talked to Agatha? Is that why you two are headed to the mountains?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice was starting to get a clearer picture, and she needed to know just how much Rio knew.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda did. I talked to Lilia. Alice, I need you to answer me honestly. Me. The person that may have withheld some things from you, but never lied. You always told me that Lorna had relapsed and overdosed. What really happened?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was blinking back tears as Wanda reached over and put a hand on her knee. They would be at the cabin soon and could debrief then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen moved closer to Alice and wrapped an arm around her. She knew that Alice had known quite a bit about Lorna. She also knew that Alice had grown close with Lilia over the past ten years and had flown under the radar. It’s why they had their suspicions that something had happened between Agatha and Lilia. Alice had shown Jen the letter that Lorna had left her. Alice confided in Jen in a way that she couldn’t in Rio because Jen had signed the same NDAs, and Alice, the law-abiding citizen that she was, wouldn’t break that NDA. While Alice could have told Rio about Lorna, she didn’t want Rio to worry, especially with Alice working at SHIELD.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Now, it was coming back to bite her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Just as Lilia had warned Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice’s heart squeezed as a tear slid down her cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It sounds like you already know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio choked back a sob. “How long have you been keeping it from me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice leaned into Jen, needing the support. “Mom left me a letter and that envelope we kept in your safe. Agatha gave it to me at the funeral, along with Lilia’s information. I never did open the larger envelope, but I read the letter and called Agatha a few days after the funeral and talked to her. Mom put everything in that letter.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You knew for thirteen, no, fourteen, years, and never told me. Three of those years, you were still in San Francisco, and we taught at the same school Alice. I’m not having the rest of this conversation over the phone. It’s not fair to either of us. I love you, but we are not okay.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio waited before she hung up. They had agreed a long time ago to never hang up on each other, especially when upset.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love you too, and that’s fair. I’ll be up there in a few days. Be careful.” With that, they hung up, and Alice slumped into Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What did I do?” Alice whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smoothed her hair and rubbed her back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What you thought was best, and you stuck to the law, no matter how many times Lilia told you to tell Rio everything anyway vaguely.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice sat up to look at her wife.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What do I do now?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What you always do. Seek Lilia’s guidance and then head up to face the music while I face whatever fresh hell is about to break out here.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen knew that nothing good was about to come from whatever part Nat had played and just where Rio’s mind had gone when she found out about Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How are you feeling?” Wanda asked Rio after the connection ended.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was looking out of the windshield at the scenery, trying to process it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fourteen years,” it was all she could say.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know how you feel,” Wanda said in solidarity.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We should go snowboarding while we’re up here, or snowmobiling, definitely to a bar.” Rio was compartmentalizing but also trying to find something to distract both of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We have no security detail, recognizable faces, and it’s a peak time of year.” Wanda grinned mischievously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Look up stuff for us to do. We’re going to have fun, and for once, I’ll be the one causing Jen’s blood pressure to rise.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio set her green suitcase on the floor of what Lilia had called a cabin. Rio was expecting a log cabin with a fireplace, maybe two bedrooms, and a bathroom. This was more like a mountain retreat, complete with a hot tub and a game room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wow, you guys call this a cabin?” Rio let out a low whistle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She’d been a part of this bitch pack for seven months now and she still hadn’t gotten used to the magnitude of it all. Wanda smiled as she searched for something.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It has wooden features, doesn’t it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She took a picture frame off the wall and opened a panel behind it, revealing a switchboard of some kind, and flipped several off. Rio’s eyes followed the woman as she closed the panel, replaced the picture, and continued on her search.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What are you doing?” Rio finally asked as she watched Wanda find a screwdriver and head upstairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Disabling the inside cameras. Of course, there aren’t any in private areas, and I’ll keep the outside ones enabled, but the inside ones go to an app on Lilia’s phone. We don’t need anyone to know what we’re up to. That’s exactly why she sent you, us, here. So she could keep her eyes and ears on us both. She forgets who raised me. I WIN LILIA!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda finished before heading up the stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, go claim a room. Lilia has maintained this place and recently renovated it, but knowing her, the room I usually stayed in is still mine, and Agatha’s is still hers, up here, hall on the right, room on the left.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio picked her suitcase back up and headed up the stairs behind Wanda. She might as well stay in Agatha’s room. She knew what was going to happen. She and Wanda would talk things through with each other, Agatha and Nat, maybe even Alice, would come up, and everyone would talk, and she would fall back into Agatha’s arms. That was the habit they were building, wasn’t it?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hadn’t done anything other than withholding information, which Rio had admittedly also done. It was just that Agatha kept doing it, and this was important for Rio to know. Especially since it affected her relationship with her best friend. Not to mention there were a lot of holes to fill in with the past now. She remembered every detail of those run-ins with Agatha all those years ago and the following mornings. What was the real story as to why she was there?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They could talk through that later. As for now, she walked into the room that Wanda had labeled as Agatha’s, and Rio agreed. It had been updated, but Lilia had kept the touches of Agatha here. Not as a shrine, but as a reminder of the times spent here, the times Rio assumed Agatha had spent here with Lorna trying to detox. Wanda had talked about their trips here, all those years ago. Of a time Agatha had broken her leg trying to show off for a hot ski instructor, Lorna bringing back a souvenir. The souvenir was a 6’3 blonde man who was visiting from Texas, and they dated for four months.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked around the room with its purple accents. A stuffed moose that looked old enough to have chronic back pain sat in the middle of the bed on the pillows. There was a picture on the nightstand of an extremely young Agatha - not more than twenty, with Lorna and Lilia on either side of her, leaning against a pool table. Agatha had a devilish smirk on her face as if she knew she had each woman wrapped around her little finger. Lorna had an arm wrapped around Agatha, with Lilia’s hand in hers. The way these women held themselves was as if they knew that their mere presence could cast a spell on someone, and they would immediately be at their service.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Looking around the room, Rio could see how much hope Lilia had that everything would eventually be reconciled, whether Rio was in the picture or not. She ran a hand through her hair and huffed. Rio knew how important found and chosen family was and how much she would put into reconciling with Alice, no matter how betrayed she felt at the moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s a lot to take in, and the feelings are all over the place. I get it.” Wanda was leaning against the door frame. “So, snowmobiles? Bars? Tattoos? What reckless decisions should we make?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes.” Rio turned to her suitcase. “Let me find something more weather-appropriate. Have you told Nat where you are?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No. She can track me if she’s so concerned,” Wanda said curtly as she pushed off the doorframe and went back to her room to change.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re not wearing your necklace!” Rio called after her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s a big girl, she can figure it out,” Wanda called back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was late afternoon when they arrived at the snowmobile rental place. Wanda looked over at Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Have you ever driven one of these?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, but Taylor and Harry did it. How hard can it be?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They also got into an accident and almost died.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda hadn’t done this in years, and the last time she had, she very narrowly missed a tree.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, let’s not do that.” Rio looked at her as if it was a simple task.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, if we die, Jen can’t be mad, right?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Exactly,” Rio confirmed with a nod.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While they had attempted to disguise themselves, they had done so poorly as people near them were starting to whisper and take pictures. Wanda looked delighted. “You wanted this to happen, didn’t you?” Rio whispered out of the side of her mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded enthusiastically as they signed papers and took the keys from a starstruck kid who was not so subtly taking pictures.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They walked outside to find their vehicles and hopefully not end up wrapped around a tree. Rio noticed that her notifications for various apps were already increasing by the second.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, Red, looks like we’ve been sighted together.” Rio zipped her phone into her snow pants and climbed on the black snowmobile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was tucking her hair into her helmet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is that so? What else are the citizens of the internet saying?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put on her own helmet and started the snowmobile engine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That we were standing very closely together,” Rio yelled over the noise of the engines as she started to pull slowly out of the lot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What a scandal!” Wanda yelled as she followed her. They both picked up speed as they hit the open snow.
     </span>

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Much earlier that morning
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat couldn’t sleep and, knowing Agatha had gone straight to Lilia’s, decided to join both of them. Nat had done what she could to keep Lilia in her life, even if at the edges. Lilia and Lorna had done so much for her all of those years ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Wanda met Vision and subsequently fell in love, Nat stayed strong for Wanda but died on the inside. She went straight to the two people who had more experience with relationships. Lorna changed relationships more than some people changed their sheets, and Lilia was polyamorous before there was even a mainstream term for it Nat knew making Vision disappear, while the easiest solution was not the best solution. The two wise aunts of her youth, however, helped both of them navigate the rocky terrain of their relationship with Wanda and each other. It hadn’t been easy, but Nat and Vision made it work, and all three of them were stronger for it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda never knew just how integral Lorna and Lilia had been to her happiness or just how close she had been to losing both Nat and Vision. However, that’s a story for another time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat smiled wryly at the memories and advice from the older women, two of three members of the original coven, as she walked up the few steps to Lilia’s and used the key she had made years ago to let herself in. When Lorna died, Nat had taken her protection charge from Lorna to include Lilia, and she unofficially watched out for her, too. Nat suspected Lilia knew and never said anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia looked up from where she and Agatha were talking and did a once-over of the newcomer, completely unfazed by her unlocking the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You look like shit, kid,” Lilia said as she finished her assessment and Agatha agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Neither of you looks any better,” Nat retorted, walking to the kitchen and pouring herself a glass of water. After a moment of consideration, she also opened the freezer and took out a bottle of vodka. She walked back into the living room and sat next to Lilia on the couch. Agatha had moved back to the chair, legs thrown over one of the arms. Nat raised the bottle to Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You still keep the emergency vodka, I see.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I never know when you’ll need it.” She smiled warmly and patted Nat on the leg. “What happened?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat shot Agatha a dirty look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Someone told me to keep a secret from Wanda of all people for years, and it blew up in my face tonight. Spectacularly,” Nat’s bottom lip began to quiver. “She’s so upset with me, and I know she’s not mad about what happened. She’s mad that I never told her and that I should have. We’ve never fought like that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat leaned into Lilia and sobbed in a way that Agatha wasn’t sure she had ever seen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat was the most steadfast and strongest of them all. Yes, she had shed a few tears here and there, she had cried at Lorna’s funeral, cried tears of joy in delivery rooms, and cried at Jen and Alice’s wedding. Agatha had seen Nat cry. She had never seen Nat sob and openly weep like this. She wasn’t entirely sure what was happening as she watched Lilia soothe Nat. This was not the sadness associated with hurting someone. There was something else there, something Agatha hadn’t seen in Nat. It was a fear and sorrow combined. But, what was different this time?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, Agatha understood that in the past, Nat had cried over what she could not have. Now, she cried at ruining what she finally had, and it was all Agatha’s fault.

<span>
       Three Days After Lorna’s Death
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha had been packing to leave for San Francisco the next day. She had stopped and sat on the edge of her bed to catch her breath. She felt like she was drowning again, and she couldn’t get enough air into her lungs. She clutched the locket in her hand as she felt the familiar sting at the back of her eyes, though she knew the tears wouldn’t come right now. She couldn’t remember the last time she had anything to drink, and she knew she was dehydrated.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       That’s when she heard the door downstairs fly open, and Nat’s voice quickly followed it, “AGATHA! I need you! AGATHA! Something’s not right!” Natasha’s voice was full of alarm and uncertainty, and Nat was never either of those things.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha didn’t remember running down the stairs, too afraid something happened to Wanda, and knowing that her heart wouldn’t be able to handle it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Nat? Is it Wanda? What happened? Is she okay?” Agatha knew her eyes were swollen and red and that she was an absolute mess as she gripped Nat’s shoulders. She was not yet thirty-eight and had just lost the closest thing to a mother she had. Not everyone was given a replacement mother, and she had been, only to lose her entirely too soon.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Nat looked like she had seen a ghost, and Agatha quickly pushed her pain and grief aside for a few moments as she saw the fear, worry, and confusion in the younger woman’s eyes.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Natasha, what happened?” Agatha asked again.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “A few days ago, Lorna asked me about certain,” Nat tilted her head back and forth as if looking for a way to phrase it, “‘medications,’ and I thought she was researching a role or something.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Nat was staring into Agatha’s very being, willing her to understand, not wanting to say the words. Agatha had seen the reports. She knew exactly what had happened. She had read that first letter. Lorna didn’t say where she had gotten her means to an end, just that she had. Everything clicked, and she knew.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Nat removed one of Agatha’s hands from her shoulder and thrust a piece of paper into it. Agatha read Lorna’s words, and her head dropped.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Damnit Lorna, why?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She whispered before looking back at Nat, and dropping the other hand, giving her the note back.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I can’t tell you why; she just knew what she was doing,” Agatha explained while Nat nodded, accepting it. “You can’t tell Wanda.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I tell Wanda everything. There are no secrets between us, Agatha.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Lorna didn’t want anyone to know for very specific reasons, and I have to honor that. Please?” It was more of a plea than anything.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Nat was struggling internally. How was she supposed to keep this from the woman she loved more than anything? Yes, Agatha had a sworn loyalty to Lorna, and they both knew that Wanda was terrible at keeping secrets. It was a miracle their…situation hadn’t been splashed everywhere by now. She assumed that was Agatha’s doing. Nat gave a resigned sigh.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “What happens when she eventually finds out, Agatha? What then?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I deal with it then. Trust me, Nat, it will be fine.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha tried to smile, but she didn’t have it in her right now. She knew what would happen. She would take every ounce of blame for Nat. She would never come in between two of her favorite people. She was still living for the hope of Wanda and Nat getting their happily ever after. She had already come in between one extremely strong friendship. She wouldn’t come in between a relationship. Nat still looked conflicted as Agatha wrapped her arms around her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I love you both so much, and I will do anything to protect both of you. This is for your protection too, you know. I will do whatever I need to do if she finds out, okay? I am so sorry you were dragged into this, and I know if Lorna had another option, she never would have involved you.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha kissed her on the top of the head and leaned back to look at her, using the pad of her thumb to wipe the one lone tear from Nat’s cheek.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Careful, Romanov, someone will think you’ve gone soft,” Agatha teased.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Shut up,” Nat mumbled. “I know Lorna must have had her reasons. I won’t say anything, but if and when she finds out, I trust you to fix it, Agatha,” Nat’s blue-green eyes were stormy blue, severe, and serious. Nat looked like the eighteen-year-old assassin Agatha first knew, not the twenty-seven-year-old woman who stood before her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I promise, kid. Now, go pack and provide the type of comfort only you can provide, Wanda. Vision has all the boys at the clubhouse right now, and she needs her North Star.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Nat smiled at the nickname Wanda had given her years ago. “How do you know about that?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Wanda can’t keep a secret.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You promised me, Agatha,” Nat said between sobs as she glared at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was staring at her blankly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What?” She blinked, coming out of her memories.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You promised you’d fix it,” Nat repeated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her with warmth and false confidence.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Am I trying to convince Nat or myself of this?
      </span>
</em>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And I will, once she’s ready to talk to us, once they’re both ready. You know as well as I do that they both need time.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia chuckled, “Right, and who told you to wait before going to talk to Rio?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can it, Calderu.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes. She turned back to Natasha, who seemed to be slowing a bit with her sobs. Agatha’s first reaction had been to go to her, but it seemed as though Natasha had needed Lilia more. Agatha thought that she had just removed Lilia from her life, and Lorna’s by extension. However, Lilia had stayed away from all of them. She was slowly learning that they all retained relationships with Lilia but not in the same capacity and intensity. Nat had been right to say that it wasn’t Agatha’s decision. She remembered back to when Wanda first met Vision and how Nat had been a bit guarded when Wanda and Vision had first started dating. Nat had spent a lot of time doing extra weapons training those first few weeks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at Lilia. Nat was now quieter, the vodka had calmed her and brought her back to the intense Slavic introspective state. She drank water instead of vodka as she leaned against Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It was you, and I’m sure Lorna,” Agatha pointed a finger in Lilia’s direction accusingly. “When Wanda and Vision started dating, worlds began to collide. Nat went to the two of you. You two are the reason they get along so well. Nat didn’t just roll over, she was pissed and ready to put up a fight. Vision is a golden retriever, she’s a black cat, and you two somehow got them to work it all out.” Agatha realized that she had two Ms. Miyagi’s and she was the grasshopper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked at her. “Some of the best advice either of us got.” She looked back at Lilia. “Sounds like you both should have taken your own advice.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia sighed. “Sometimes the burden of being wise is knowing what advice to give to others and not knowing what advice to keep for yourself.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat gave a short laugh and looked back at Agatha. “You must have learned that from them, too.” She then looked between both of them. “I’m glad you’re repairing things. You two need each other.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha crossed her arms over her chest like a petulant teen. “I do not need anyone,” She lied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, shut up,” Lilia and Nat said in unison.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia regarded Nat carefully as if to make sure she wasn’t at risk of breaking apart again. “Are you okay? I haven’t seen you like that since you came to us worried you would lose Wanda.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat let out a shaky breath. “I think so? As long as I don’t lose her. It takes a lot to break me, but hurting or losing her? Russian assassin training didn’t prepare for that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia gave her a look of warmth and put a comforting hand on her knee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There are some things in life that we cannot prepare or train for,” Lilia turned and looked at Agatha as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt that in her soul.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well damn, we’re just all getting insight tonight, aren’t we?” Agatha ran her hand through her tangled mess of hair. “So do we wait for Alice to join team ‘win Rio and Wanda back’ or go up ourselves?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat slumped back onto the couch. “She knew, didn’t she?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Lilia both nodded. “Alice has been keeping a lot of cards close to her chest, right Lils?” Agatha shot her a look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I told her to tell Rio everything, law be damned,” Lilia replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh fuck. She might be in deeper shit than we are,” Nat took a swig of emergency vodka out of solidarity for Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Either way, the next few days are going to be interesting for you three,” Lilia gestured.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Us? You’re not getting out of this unscathed.” Agatha said, sitting up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, but I’ve been preparing for this and wasn’t blindsided.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I need to get better at telling the truth,” Agatha admitted, surprising even herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No shit, can we get a recording of that?” Nat pulled out her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s a hard lesson to learn,” Lilia spoke from experience.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had always learned her lessons the hard way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had returned to the compound around nine Sunday morning. She knew she had to wait before rushing up to the Mammoth Lakes area where Lilia’s cabin was, roughly three hours south of the Tahoe cabin. She would shower, pack preemptively, and bide her time. Nat had stayed back at Lilia’s for a bit to let the vodka wear off before driving, and they all agreed it was best to wait until Wanda left before she went back to the house. Vision had texted Nat to ask what was up since he was keeping the twins, and she told him everything. Agatha had always been amazed at how quickly they had formed a bond all those years ago, and it really didn’t surprise her that Lilia and Lorna had a hand in that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had played puppetmaster more than she knew.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha showered and thought of Rio. Lilia had told her about the conversation, so she knew that it was the omissions and the lies that bothered Rio the most. Not to mention the
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       who
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      of it all. Agatha had slept with the majority of the women at SHIELD, which didn’t bother Rio, but Rio had developed a working friendship with Lilia, more than that, Rio trusted Lilia. Lilia had given Rio advice, pushed them together, and had a hand in bringing her out here.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then there was just Lilia, as part of Agatha. Lilia wasn’t just another notch in the mountain of invisible lipstick cases either. Lilia was the only other relationship that Agatha had ever been in, as contorted as it was. Rio also hadn’t known just how big of a part Lorna and Lilia had played in Agatha’s past, it wasn’t something they talked about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Maybe it’s time to write a book about the first part of my life,” she said to the empty bathroom as she turned the water off and stepped out of the shower to dry off and put on comfortable clothes. She planned on taking a nap and texting Rio later. She wanted to give her some space right now and let her spend time with Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The contrast of where she was yesterday evening and now stood out to her. Yesterday, they were celebrating Alice and Jen, and she was picturing her future with Rio. Now, she was preparing to fight for that future. She would be fifty-two soon, and she was done letting the trauma of the past hold her back. She and Rio needed to communicate and, for the love of all things holy and unholy, be honest with each other. Discuss what they wanted, talk through where they stood, and discuss a way forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had to stop, separate her personas and truths, merging them into one person, for Rio at least. She would always put on a different mask for public consumption, but for her loved ones, she had to remove this mask she had been wearing. She had to let down the walls she had constructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She also had to fix things with Wanda, she and Lilia were mending their relationship, and she had to speak with Alice before she spoke with Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen was going to be working overtime this week when Agatha and Wanda weren’t where they were supposed to be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned as she rolled over to try to take a nap.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Something warm was on Agatha’s chest. Something warm and loud. She cracked her eyes open and looked down to see two green eyes staring at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Raven? How did you get here?” She asked, fully expecting a spoken response. Instead, the cat just looked at her, as if expecting the human to read her mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, memories of the last twenty-four hours rushed back. She remembered that Rio had headed north with Wanda and suspected that Alice had been lying to her for over a decade. This would make sense as to why Raven would be here since Rio fully trusted Nicky to take care of the person that Rio might love most in this world. Her cat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicky has you for a few days, doesn’t he? Well, welcome back, Your Highness,” Agatha said as she gently lifted Raven off of her chest and placed her on a pillow. Raven rewarded her with a low growl. “Well, I love you too.” Agatha got up and went to find Nicky to see what he knew.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was mid-afternoon, and she found him downstairs sitting on one of the couches, scrolling on his phone. He raised his head when he heard her come down the stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There you are, Mom. Come sit down, we need to talk.” His voice was serious, and so was his facial expression.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was slightly taken aback as she had a seat and looked at her son.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Geeze Dad, what did I do? I promise it was Johnny who caused me to stay out past curfew!” She played innocent, trying to make him laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It didn’t work.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Cut the theatrics, Mom, this is serious. Tommy and Billy are at Uncle Vision’s house. Aunt Nat didn’t get home until after Aunt Wanda left. Rio and Aunt Wanda disappeared to the mountains, and they didn’t go to the cabin in Tahoe. Alice didn’t know anything and was worried when she called Rio. You left late last night and didn’t get home until this morning. I’m taking care of Raven instead of Alice.” He threw a hand into the air. “What is going on?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her son, realization hitting her like a blow from an MMA fighter. Nicky was like her in so many ways, and she and Wanda, along with Vision and Nat, had worked so hard to raise these boys in a happy and healthy home with many adults who loved them. They had vowed to let them be kids and give them every opportunity they could. They made sure to take care of their social-emotional and psychological needs as well as their physical and educational needs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Yet here Nicky was, still wise beyond his years. It wasn’t a bad thing, but Agatha wondered just how much of his youth she may have stolen from him. How much he had been forced to grow up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Like she had been.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      How many times had he parented her? Like he was doing now. She had always treated him like an actual human being. She had never talked down to him or treated him like a second or third-class citizen like some people did with children.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Here he was, demanding answers for what should be adult problems, yet he cared because it did involve him. This was his family, and she didn’t want him to worry.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt as though she was waking up from a nearly twenty-year dark night and realizing there had been quite a few casualties along the way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Before I answer any of your questions, Nicholas, do I allow you to be a kid?” She asked softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      His shocked expression as he thought about how to answer told Agatha that this was not the conversation he had been expecting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes. You give me a lot of independence, and I honestly think I’m better for it. Billy and Tommy, too. You, Aunt Wanda, Aunt Nat, and Uncle Vision, you’re all as involved as you possibly can be, and unlike our friends with famous parents, we weren’t constantly left with nannies or other people. I love that we have a compound of people and our private little woods to explore. I wouldn’t change the way I grew up and am still growing up for anything, Mom. I wish I didn’t see details about my mom’s other activities everywhere though, and I have seen some pictures of you, and Aunt Wanda, by accident that I did not want to see.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky’s face was one of pure teenage disgust. Agatha remembered that day. He had been very curious as to why there were certain movies of theirs he couldn’t watch. Just like his mother, he found out the hard way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He never questioned either of them again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know I’m wiser than my peers, don’t look so shocked that I’m self-aware, Mom. I hear it from my teachers. I think that comes from being a Harkness and all the social-emotional workshops and different things we were put in as kids. My childhood has been different, but you still let me be a kid. You allowed me to make mistakes, but I still had and have consequences, I played more than my share of pranks. You didn’t take my childhood from me, Mom. It’s been different, but all three of us are still getting to be kids. We just have to reverse roles sometimes because our three moms didn’t get to be kids. You may think you’ve buried the past, but there are some very dedicated fan accounts out there.” He took a drink of the soda he had. “There are also some very interesting pictures that I’m sure you didn’t know existed.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t think I want to know how much you know.” Agatha hated how dedicated some of her fans were. She was flattered, yes, but also, she didn’t need that complication.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank you for being honest, Nicky, and please remember to be a kid. No one is pushing or forcing you to grow up, okay? Enjoy this time while you can.” She moved to sit next to him. “You’re such a great kid.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have some pretty awesome parents, but most of all, Agatha Harkness is a kick-ass mom.” Raven jumped over the back of the couch and positioned herself in between them. “Right, the actual reason for all this. Mom? What is going on?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked down at the purring traitor and scratched her under the chin. “Where to begin? Okay, I told you I was in a relationship once, right?” She couldn’t remember who knew what.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, before I was born. No, I don’t know who that was, and I do not need to know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky tried to keep his mother’s indiscretions separate. Rio was one thing, he didn’t need to know about any others. They weren’t important.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Right, well Rio figured out who it was yesterday at the reception and didn’t exactly take it well. That set off a series of events which led to several difficult conversations. Nat revealed something she was keeping from Wanda…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky’s jaw dropped. “Aunt Nat kept something from Aunt Wanda? I didn’t think that was possible for them to do.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky knew that his aunts were always honest with each other, no matter what.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, so Wanda is hurt, as you can imagine, and Rio is mad at me because, yet again, I didn’t tell her the complete story. So the two of them went to Lilia's cabin, where Lorna and I spent a lot of time when I was much younger. Rio then found out Alice and I were closer than Alice let on, and that’s it in a nutshell.” She explained quickly, hoping he didn’t connect the dots.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky pretended he did not connect the dots and pushed the unwanted information to the dredges of his mind. He could work through that in another ten to fifteen years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So go after her. All three of you, go after them.” He looked at her like she was an idiot for staying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She shook her head. “I can’t yet. They need some time to talk about things and process, and then we’ll go up there and get everything worked out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky gave his mom a sad look. “This is what I was worried about.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, Nicholas.” She patted his knee. “This is what I tried to prevent, and I did a terrible job of it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It wouldn’t kill you to just stick to the truth, Mom.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not sure if I know what it is anymore. Not completely.” She frowned down at the floor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mom, I suggest you journal. It’s a very healthy coping mechanism.” Journaling! He should be having fun, not getting on to his mother.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Go back to being a kid. Have a pasture party, throw a house party in the clubhouse, do something.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Before I throw a party so epic the cops get called and I begin my criminal record, you better get her back, Mom. Yes, you both have your baggage, but she’s good for you. Your son cannot have a more stable relationship than you do, and I like seeing you happy. You’re not the only one that will lose.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She nodded and patted his shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, kiddo. I love you and thank you for parenting me sometimes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He scoffed. “Yeah, well, you need it. I’ve seen your criminal record.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Those records are sealed, sir.” She held her hand to her chest in shock.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So you do have a criminal record!” He affirmed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What? You tricked me!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I learned from the best. I love you too, Mom. Make sure you get my future stepmom back, and I am absolutely having that party next week.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The wind whipped past Rio’s face, filling her with a rare exhilaration as they zipped through the trees in the growing darkness. She knew they should head back, but they had headlights, and these things were easy to maneuver. She was probably going entirely too fast, and neither of them were in their twenties anymore. If they wiped out, they could seriously injure themselves.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked over her shoulder at Wanda to motion to her to turn around, to see Wanda pointing frantically and slowing down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned around too late and hit the snowbank going extremely too fast. The vehicle went airborne as Rio went over the handlebars and landed in the snow, everything going black.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio! Rio! Oh God, if you die, Agatha is going to kill me.” Wanda had gently taken Rio’s helmet off and was looking down at her, worried and blinking back tears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Laughter floated to Rio’s ears, and she was immediately angry. Who would laugh at this situation? She could be seriously injured.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, she realized she was the one laughing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda, I’m fine!” She sat up and groaned. She would absolutely feel this in the morning. “I’m going to be bruised in the morning, and my head hurts, but I’m fine.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We need to get you to a medic or something. you could have a concussion.” Wanda’s eyes were wide as she looked around to see if there was anyone around that she could flag down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A medic? What is this, war? Don’t worry, battle buddy, I’ll be fine. Help me up. Let’s return these and go find a bar or something. Nothing a few shots won’t cure.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio carefully stood with Wanda’s assistance and waited a moment to make sure she was balanced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, I’m good,” Rio said, taking a few steps and almost falling down. Wanda caught her by the waist. “That was a trust fall,” Rio said as Wanda side-eyed her. “No, really, I’m fine,” Rio let Wanda help her over to the overturned snowmobile. It was a little dented but turned on and seemed to still run.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you sure you can drive?” Wanda asked skeptically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, we’ll just go slower, and I’ll make sure to stay near you.” Her head was pounding. “Do you know if there’s a first aid station anywhere? It probably wouldn’t hurt to get checked out, just in case,” Rio said as she touched her head and winced at how tender it was. No blood, so the helmet did its job, but it didn’t feel great.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’re surrounded by chaos. I think I saw one between here and the rental place. Come on, don’t get hurt anymore. Remember, we only have our phones for Nat to track us if they figure out we left the necklaces at the cabin, and service isn’t that reliable out here.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda mounted the snowmobile and watched Rio as she got on hers. The first aid station was right next to their destination. The women returned their rentals first, thankful they had gone with the insurance to cover any damages. Rio seemed to be doing better after the initial shock to her system, though Wanda still insisted she get checked out. Rio’s phone had survived the impact, for which she was immensely grateful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They stepped into the small building that was equipped to handle basic emergencies until other arrangements could be made. The nurse’s eyes widened once she realized who had just walked through the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re Wanda Maximoff!” She exclaimed, blinking rapidly like she was trying to clear her vision. She was a short woman with pale skin and short blonde hair cut in a bob. She had blue eyes and, if Rio had to guess, was in her late fifties. The woman looked at Rio, still stunned. “And you look like you’ve had better days. Rio, right?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She asked as she pointed to a table and turned to get gloves, the shock wearing off as she set to her task.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m Sharon, Wanda dear, have a seat. I’m a big fan of yours and Agatha’s. I thought I heard whispers that you were here again.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon went over Rio, checking her eyes with a flashlight, lightly pressing her neck, and checking her scalp for any contusions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re going to have some nasty bruises tomorrow, but that helmet did its job. You took a nasty tumble. Did you hit a snowbank?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. This woman was good.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Going about seventy, flew over the handlebars?” Sharon continued. “I’ve seen this same scenario hundreds of times.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s exactly what happened. It was terrifying.” Wanda said from behind them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Most people walk away with just bruises. You were still lucky. That could have been much worse. Now, you need to be very careful with that head injury. You do have a mild concussion, and you need to keep an eye on it. No strenuous activity for the next couple of days, definitely no more snow sports.” Sharon looked at Wanda. “Don’t let her do anything stupid, please.” Sharon unlocked a cabinet and grabbed a bottle of prescription-strength Tylenol. “Here, this will help. I trust you both to take these responsibly.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They nodded, feeling as though they were being scolded and threatened at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Now that we’ve got the head and neck out of the way, how does the rest of your body feel?” Sharon asked, looking her over with well-trained and knowledgeable eyes. She had done this for so long and had listened to her breathing, watched her walk, how she talked, and how she sat. She knew nothing was majorly broken, and there wasn’t any internal bleeding. Rio might not actually have a concussion, but Sharon firmly believed in being cautious with heads and brains.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sore, but I’ve had broken bones before, and nothing feels broken,” Rio thought back to a year ago when she was in the hospital, and while she hurt, it was not like that. The snow was much softer than the pavement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good. If you feel worse, go to the hospital. You’re too far from LA to go to your regular doctor.” Sharon looked from Rio to Wanda. “So, why are you two up here with seemingly no security detail, girlfriend, fiancèe, ex-husband, kids, or entourage?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shifted in her chair while Wanda looked away. They both seemed like teenagers who had gotten caught sneaking out in the middle of the night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t worry, I’m not telling anyone I saw either of you, laws and all, but I do keep up with celebrity news, and Rio, I know you’re a teacher and tomorrow is Monday.” Sharon had seen many things in her decades as a nurse. “This isn’t the first time celebrities or people dating them have come through trying to escape something. I do still get starstruck because it’s just so exciting, but you still have to face your problems eventually. Watch your head, blow off some steam, and then face it head-on. Not literally. Whatever it is you two need a break from, you can absolutely handle it, especially since you have each other. Now, I need to close down the clinic, and I have a feeling you are not going to take it easy. I have a few suggestions of places to go to if you want them.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn’t sure what it was about this woman that seemed familiar, but it did. Sharon wrote down a few different places for them, restaurants that would be more discreet, a karaoke bar, and even tattoo artists she recommended. Rio exchanged numbers with the nurse. She had a feeling they were going to see Sharon Davis-Hart again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they walked back to the car, Rio took two Tylenol and chased them with water that Sharon had given her. She screwed the lid back on and climbed into the passenger seat. “Why did she seem so familiar?” Rio asked, buckling her seatbelt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You got that feeling, too? I’m glad it wasn’t just me. Maybe she’s just one of those people?” Wanda shrugged. “Anyway, dinner? We can change out of snow clothes when we get there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then, concussion be damned, drunken karaoke!” Rio pumped her fist in the air. It was going to be a fun night.
     </span>

      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By Sunday evening, Agatha was at Lilia’s again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is this becoming a habit?” Lilia asked as Agatha walked in. “Do I need to install a revolving door? I see you still have your key.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had also noticed the skull and crossbones keychain attached to said key.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not a sword for the keychain?” Lilia asked, continuing her task in the kitchen as Agatha sat at the table and watched her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I couldn’t find one.” She took a sip of her water from her giant tumbler. She was trying to drink mainly water for her next role. “Wait, how did you know?” Agatha said, choking on her water.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia smirked as she stirred a pot of her vodka sauce.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There were rumors of a certain tattoo on a certain lesbian sweetheart's hip going around SHIELD last year. It was some sort of rite-of-passage confirmation that people had slept with you. For a little while, they called themselves the fencing club.”
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
      She laughed as she dropped handmade gnocchi into another pot and watched it closely.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then Rio called me swords last night, and I knew.” She moved the gnocchi around a bit, ensuring they were cooking evenly before removing them from the boiling water. “Lorna always said I was taking a sword to your heart, not a knife. So, it’s appropriate.” She portioned the potato pasta into two bowls and put the rest into a third for later. Lilia then spooned vodka sauce into the bowls, picked up forks, and carried them to the table. She placed a bowl in front of Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, you’re preparing for a role. Eat,” Lilia instructed as Agatha opened her mouth to protest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave a small smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I took the nickname from my character’s tarot card.” Agatha knew she didn’t have to name the movie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know. That card was fitting for you as well.” Lilia took a bite of the gnocchi and looked at Agatha. She looked tired, stressed, and oh so worried. “Still haven’t heard from them?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stabbed a perfectly shaped potato dumpling. “No,” she said tersely, not making eye contact. “I don’t want to push it, but I’m worried. Nat hasn’t heard anything either, but we’ve seen things on social media. Apparently, they went snowmobiling. Why haven’t they called? Texted? Smoke signals? All day, I have realized just how much I’ve manipulated everyone over the years. Just like…” Agatha looked away, not wanting to admit it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, we did what we thought was best, and that’s what you were doing. In protecting everyone, we ended up manipulating situations. You never had a childhood, granted. Your generation didn’t have a childhood, but you especially. You’ve been an adult since your first role. When Lorna met you, she immediately tried to protect you, and then she brought me into it. We did everything we could, and then, well…I very much got sidetracked, and I am so sorry, and I take the blame for teaching you how to split yourself into two people, Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia just wanted to hug her—the years of hurt, the years of good intentions leading to hell. Agatha looked up at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve done a lot of thinking this morning, talking to Nicky. I know I’m going to have even more conversations. Lilia, it’s not all your fault. Especially as I got older, I knew we were doomed, but I got to a point where I thought that was the only way to keep you in my life, and it wasn’t. I needed to communicate, we both did. I think that’s why I’m so nervous about not talking to Rio right now. I know communication needs to happen, and she’s not communicating.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had always acted older than her years, but for the first time, she looked it. Lilia reached across the table and put her hand on Agatha’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Aggie, everything will be okay and work out, okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded, softening at Lilia's familiar nickname for her. She needed this, Lilia. The Lilia that always had something cooking, the one that had comforted her when she lost out on roles or awards or put ice packs on bruises that Evanora had inflicted on her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Remember when you taught me how to make alfredo sauce from scratch?” Agatha asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia laughed. “Yes! Lorna and I lived together. You were sixteen, and we decided it was time for you to learn how to make healthy food.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because your Alfredo sauce is healthy?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sicilian calories don’t count, kid. Anyway, Lorna kept laughing because of how big of a mess you were making, even though she had burned the fettuccine noodles.” Lilia laughed at the memory.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Which I made fun of her for, only then I scorched the cream for the sauce and she wouldn’t let me live it down,” Agatha snorted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This was what Agatha had missed and needed back in her life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stood to clear the table when the door flew open, and Alice stormed in with Jen behind her. Jen closed the door softly, eyes narrowing as they landed on Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lilia, Rio knows I’ve been lying to her, not telling her everything, whatever the fuck it is I’ve been doing,” Alice said as she stormed straight into the kitchen and into Lilia’s waiting arms. Lilia had stood just in time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha put the now clean dishes on the drainboard and leaned against the counter with her arms crossed over her chest and her legs crossed at the ankles. “You’ve been what now?” Agatha said, now ready to fight someone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, like you haven't been doing that to absolutely everyone you’ve ever met,” Jen said as she walked into the kitchen and fixed a bowl of gnocchi.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia released Alice. “What did I tell you, Alice?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “To tell her everything, law be damned.” Alice looked down at her shoes, knowing that past Alice was yelling at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wait, just how close are you two?” Agatha asked, trying to put things together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Pretty damn close,” Jen answered, taking a bite of her food. “Lilia, can our next cooking lesson be this sauce?” Jen asked, trying to goad Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course,” Lilia turned back to Alice. “I’m the one that told her. I don’t apologize for that. She needed to know. I didn’t tell her that you and I have developed a friendship or anything. That was something you needed to do, and you’ve had a year.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know it was. I just, I didn’t know how, and then she and Agatha became friends, and I barely saw her…” Alice walked into the living room and sat on the couch, the other three women followed behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re jealous of me again,” Agatha said knowingly as she sat in her chair. “You blamed me for taking Lorna away from you, and then you got jealous when Rio and I grew close, even if you were in the same room.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “DO YOU BLAME ME?!” Alice shouted, standing up. “Lorna was never my mother. She didn’t even try until she started dying, and that was from guilt. She did more parenting through letters after she died than she did when she was alive because of you, Agatha. It took me the three years between when she and Gran died to work through that in therapy before I could take the job at SHIELD because I couldn’t stand to be anywhere near you. To be reminded of what I lost. Gran tried to make sure that Rio and I weren’t home if Mom was going to be so that we wouldn’t see whatever state she was in because everyone was trying to protect me. Even Rio tried to protect me from it because of what she saw during her first twelve years of life!” Alice was breathing heavily while Agatha looked at her lovingly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had zero negative feelings toward Alice, and it only fueled Alice’s anger.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia touched Jen’s arm and made her go to the backyard with her, saying she needed help in the garden.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “THEN, because Mom had specific instructions on some of her letters, there was one I was supposed to open when Gran died. Do you know what THAT letter said? That sixteen-year-old Agatha Harkness and Lilia were the two people who convinced her to keep me. The person she chose to raise over me was the person who had said, ‘Lorna, you’ll be a great mom. Keep your kid.’ She also went on to say how much you wanted her to move Gran and me to LA. How many times you told her that she did a great job with you and would do a great job with me, too. How could I be mad at that? As an adult, I came to terms with it, and I was fine, but then Rio moved out here, and I felt it bubble up again. I want Rio to be happy. I encouraged this, and I still do because I know how much she loves you and Agatha, you love her so much. But fuck, I was transported back to that kid that always saw Lorna Wu on red carpets next to Agatha Harkness on TV. Or Lorna Wu talk about Agatha Harkness in interviews, and now my sister is being talked about by Agatha Harkness. So yes, I did get jealous because it’s deja vu for me, okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice’s chest was rising and falling rapidly, her anger still on display. Agatha’s face had not changed. She knew this day was coming.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then, when I came out here, I knew that Mom and Lilia had been close. Mom told me so in a letter. So yes, Lilia and I developed a friendship, and then Jen and I developed a friendship, and I made the biggest mistake of my life by not telling Rio, and when Rio told me you had been in a relationship forever ago, Jen and I guessed it was Lilia. You and Lilia kept each other at arm’s length, which we thought was odd considering how close she and Mom used to be, how close you and Mom were, and the stories we’ve heard. Then I lied to my best friend and sister, and based on Wanda going with Rio, it sounds like you did the same thing. I’m you.” Alice finally lost steam and plopped down on the couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re not me, Alice. You weren’t lying or withholding for selfish reasons. I have tried to apologize and make things up to you since you moved out here, before, really. I love and care for you so much and have since the day you were born, and you refuse to see it or let me get too close. I cut your umbilical cord. Well, Lilia, your mother and I, we all did it together. Your mother did such a fantastic job that day. I was exhausted. She was a superhero.” Agatha smiled at the memory. “Yes, I was still a baby myself when you were born, kiddo, and when your mother decided I was a great candidate to leave you with if something were to happen. Please know that I have been trying to do whatever I could to make up for you not being raised by Lorna. I still feel guilty about it, and it’s still a thing I discuss with my therapist. It’s also one of the reasons I am so involved with Nicky, put him in different programs, raised him the way I did, built the compound with Wanda, and am bringing you into the compound because of what your mother taught me about chosen family and parenting. If I need to push Rio to spend more one-on-one time with you, I will. I understand needing that time and I am so thankful that Vis and Nat have always understood that about Wanda and me.
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I never meant to take Lorna from you, and that was her decision. I will never take Rio from you. You do have a lot to explain to her, though, just as I have a few more tough conversations to have myself.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha moved next to Alice and wrapped her arms around her like she would with Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “One of the things your mother wrote to me in one of her letters was to make sure you knew how much she loved you, and Alice, she really did. It’s why she did what she did, leaving you with Norma.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha squeezed her. Alice nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know that now, and I know you aren’t awful. I should have been honest with Rio and you, too.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It sounds like a lot of us should have been. Now, just how close have you and Lilia been this whole time?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice laughed.

<p>
<span>
      Jen sat in a chair on the back porch, staring at Lilia, straining to hear the conversation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She couldn’t hear anything other than an occasional murmur and looked nervously at Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Everything will be okay, right?” She asked the wise-to-her woman in front of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia patted Jen’s shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course, Jen. This truth that is coming out about everyone changes dynamics a smidge, and everyone will have to adjust to that. There are growing pains in the process. Secrets hurt people. I know that more than anyone.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen and Alice had talked about the possibility of Agatha and Lilia being exes, but now that it had been confirmed, Jen was a bit weirded out by it all. It was a lot to take in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia seemed to be reading Jen’s mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I shouldn’t have let it happen, but people do stupid things. I, unfortunately, let it continue for entirely too long.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s why you kept telling Alice to talk to Rio for so long.” Jen studied Lilia, trying to read her the way Lilia read others.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes. I told Lorna. I told her everything, and I encouraged Alice to do the same. She never did, and now we’re here.” Lilia looked at the door as she heard laughter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s good, right?” Jen looked at the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia nodded. “I think that’s our cue. Jen, just keep loving and supporting Alice no matter what.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course.” Jen rose, reaching for the door, Lilia next to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This could be a very rough week, Jen,” Lilia reiterated as they reentered the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My clients are Agatha Harkness and Wanda Maximoff. I’ve been on blood pressure medication since I was thirty-one.”

      WandRio, as they were now calling themselves, had found a restaurant that Sharon had recommended on the main strip in town where all the storefronts were designed to look like one large ski resort. In their planning, they had found the karaoke bar and a tattoo parlor, which was no longer a joke and very much a reality as they booked appointments for the next afternoon, knowing they couldn’t get them after drinking. They had found a place to change and were doing a terrible job at hiding who they were as they sat in a back corner of the rustic dining establishment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How are you feeling about everything?” Rio asked as she drank her second margarita, having finished her meal at record speed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just conflicted. I really need to talk to Nat and Agatha. We’ve been this family for so long, and I was able to keep some contact with Lilia, but not like I wanted to. Lilia, Lorna, and Agatha raised me, and they raised Nat, too. Nat, like Agatha, was always more mature, as you can imagine. I was so naive, and my parents had tried extremely hard to shelter me from what they could, even growing up in a war zone.” Wanda popped one of the last few fries in her mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m familiar with some of your backstory, what you’ve shared in interviews, and the little bits and pieces I’ve picked up from the past few months. I’m so sorry for what you went through, Wanda.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was sincere. She remembered seeing footage of that particular Eastern European conflict on the news when she was very young and then learning about it in high school. By then, Wanda was a movie star and was always mentioned as a survivor of the war.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda hated it and yet, just shrugged. It was a habit she developed as a means to avoid the topic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We all have a past, and some are worse than others. Yours isn’t very pretty, either. Did you know that Norma sent pictures to Lorna of Alice, and we would occasionally see ones with you in them too?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nearly choked on her glorified alcohol slush.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “WHAT? No, I certainly did not know that.” Agatha had seen pictures of her as an awkward teenager? Oh God. How were they dating? She and Agatha had also met a few times, but they had both just laughed those off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You and Alice were so gorgeous at prom when you went together.” Wanda teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I hate you.” Rio glared as Wanda laughed, causing a few people to look at them and snap pictures.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Anyway, you didn’t have a great past, either. Norma didn’t tell us the whole story of course, just that you had shitty parents and she had decided you were hers and Alice’s after a few months. Agatha did fill me in after you told her the rest, though.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda ate her last french fry and pushed the plate away from her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I went from a loving, caring family to not that. I met Agatha almost immediately. I was obsessed with sitcoms, and she had been in some of my favorites when she was a child and teenager, and then I was cast in a show with her due to nepotism. She noticed the signs of mistreatment almost immediately, as did Lorna and Lilia, having been through it before with Agatha. It didn’t take them long to basically get custody of me. My aunt got fired, and who knows what happened to her. I honestly don’t know, actually.” Wanda shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Anyway, Lorna and Lilia were quirky, but they loved us. They didn’t bat an eye when Nat joined the picture. Agatha became the big sister I had always wanted and needed. She got the lawyers for me, an agent, a therapist, and moved me in with her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda stopped when a waitress came by to see if they needed anything else, and they went ahead and requested the check. Wanda continued her story while they waited.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My aunt had been giving me some pretty strong sleep medications because I had such terrible nightmares, and she didn’t want to deal with them. When I moved in with Aggie and started therapy, I stopped taking things to help with sleep, though the nightmares still came.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know what that woman did? She realized I had them at the same time every night and made sure she was home at those times so she could fucking spoon me and help me through the nightmares so I wouldn’t develop any sort of dependence on the meds because that’s who the true Agatha Harkness is.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We then built a house, a life, a family together. She took her would-be Russian assassin and gave her a home. She shared her family with me. She gave me so many acting tips and helped me build my career. I can never repay her for everything she’s done for me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They left the restaurant, entered the karaoke bar, and were finding a table when Wanda looked at Rio. Her eyes looked like they were holding back a river of tears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then I find out she’s been holding all these things back?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hugged her. “Oh, Wanda. I am so sorry.” Rio knew how it felt. Her chosen sister had been hiding things from her, too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know she was doing what she thought was best, but it still hurts. And Nat?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think Nat probably went to Agatha, don’t you think?” Rio reasoned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda thought about it for a few minutes. “That makes sense, but I’m still mad. I’m going to get drinks. You can sign us up for some amazing songs.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A smile spread across Rio’s face as she slid off the stool and walked up to the sign-up sheet.

      Lilia looked around her house at the four women that had gathered. Nat joined them and sat on the floor, absentmindedly flipping a pocket knife. Jen was worriedly scrolling through her phone and scowling, using one hand to smooth Alice’s hair while Alice slept in her lap. Agatha was curled in that ancient armchair Lilia had reupholstered and returned to its rightful place, smirking as she scrolled through social media and looked up at Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Penny for your thoughts.” Agatha tilted her head. There was a time she could almost read Lilia’s mind, but that time was long past.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s getting late,” Lilia said, pushing away from the doorframe of the kitchen where she had taken up residence.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you kicking me out?” Agatha said, feigning shock.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A soft smile crossed her face as she walked to where Alice was sleeping and put a hand on her arm. “Not you,” she said to Agatha and then turned to Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sorry, Jen, I need someone at school tomorrow.” Lilia looked down at Alice, “Alice, honey, you need to go get some sleep. Teenagers in the morning.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice grumbled as she rubbed her eyes with the heels of her hands. “Any word?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, babe, just social media,” Jen wiggled the phone at Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How bad?” Nat asked, not taking her eyes off the knife.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They’re pretty fucking drunk for eleven on a Sunday night, singing karaoke, cover blown, at a fairly reputable place,” Jen sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They’re having a great time and drawing a large crowd,” Agatha added, watching another video.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Which means this could go on for another day or two,” Jen groaned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia shook her head. “I don’t think it will. Maybe a day. I think they’ll call the three of you tomorrow.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia knew something. Agatha was sure of it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What songs have they done so far?” Alice sat up and put her feet on the floor to slide her Vans on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Man I Feel Like A Woman, Out of the Woods, No Body, No Crime,

<span>
      and
     </span>
<em>

      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha rattled off. “I’m keeping all of these videos. Rio singing
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Father Figure
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      is something I need to see live. Am I still upset? Yes. Am I highly amused? Also, yes.” Agatha was still upset with herself, but the videos of her best friend and girlfriend doing drunken karaoke together were highly entertaining.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s still super drunk and pissed. It’ll come. Okay, babe, take me home and to bed.” Alice yawned and stretched, not realizing what she had said, as the other three women turned to look in their direction. Jen flushed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What? We’re married, you heathens.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They said their goodbyes and left. Lilia promised to update Alice in the morning.
     </span>

      Agatha turned back to Lilia as the Sicilian sat on the couch, and Nat joined her. “Out with it, Calderu.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s just nice to have a semi-full house again, is all. Yes, Alice has been coming over a fair amount over the years, and Jen. Though it started for the worst reasons, tonight has been nice.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked away, afraid of showing too much emotion. It had been an emotionally loaded weekend.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Things are changing for the better, Lilia,” Agatha said softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat put the pocket knife away. “The band’s getting back together,” Nat added. “As soon as we finish our forgiveness tour.”

      WandRio was having a blast and enjoying themselves. Rio’s phone alerted her that they were trending, and she did not want to see the proof. They went to sit at their table as one of the bartenders came over with several shots.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hello, you two. How’s your head, Rio?” Sharon asked, lining shots up in front of both of them from the bartender’s tray.

      Wanda and Rio looked at each other and laughed.

      “Damn, well, we love it,” Rio told her taking another shot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good. I wanted to be able to keep an eye on you two tonight. I had a suspicion there’d be heavy drinking.” She looked at the now-empty shot glasses.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Guilty.” They both said at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m glad you two are having fun, but seriously, watch the head.” She gave Rio a long look before returning to the bar.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She still seems very familiar,” Rio noted as Wanda nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned back to Wanda. “Okay, what song next?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda grinned. “Silver Springs, Fleetwood Mac. Let’s get some angst out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They wrote it down and waited for their turn once more. The bar had filled up once people had heard who was inside, and everyone was more than happy to let the two women have the stage.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn’t an actress, but she could bring the drama too as the song started and the song started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha, Lilia, and Nat were seated on the couch, holding Agatha’s phone and watching a live video of the performance as Rio and Wanda belted out
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Silver Springs.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Time casts its spell on you, but you won’t forget me. I know I could have loved you, but you would not let me…” Wanda and Rio were somehow standing upright and knew the words, though it was obvious how drunk they were as they sang, looking into each other’s eyes. The crowd loved it. You could hear it through the phone. The three women on the couch, however, were not. Lilia looked at Agatha, and Agatha looked away. Nat bit her nails.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They know what they’re doing,” Lilia said cautiously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s working,” Agatha said quietly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can we go up there yet?” Nat asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda and Rio were having fun, and Sharon’s night was going well as her staff continued to fill orders, wash out glasses, and take pictures for social media. She kept a close eye on the two women on stage, diligently staying on task.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was extremely excited about their next song and had told Wanda why. As the music started, Wanda started grinning. She tossed back a shot that one of the employees had handed her, and Rio downed hers as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They looked at each other and started to sing once more, “Do you believe in life after love, after love, after love…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned and tossed her head back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I fucking hate you, Lilia.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The lyrics are supposed to be from your point of view. It’s not ABOUT you. It was FOR you,” Lilia explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat was confused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “What am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you?”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Came through the speakers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyebrows were high on her head as she looked at Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So you helped Cher write a song that was from her and my point of view? Not yours?” Agatha said in disbelief. “After our first major fight?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes. I knew then we should have ended things, and then, well…” Lilia trailed off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha softened again. “We made more stupid decisions.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Right,” Lilia agreed as she turned to see the song ending.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat got up from the couch. “This calls for the emergency vodka solely to cleanse images from my brain.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda and Rio knew Jen was back in LA, not sleeping and having heart palpitations if her texts were anything to go by. There were pictures and videos of them everywhere, and they had lost count of how many songs they had sung. They were slurring, and they had just sung all seven-plus minutes of Céline Dion’s
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Because You Love Me
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      with everyone left in the bar, which, for four a.m., was still a considerable amount of people. Sharon had been making sure they both had been eating with their alcohol and had given them something for nausea. She finally had to call it a night and close the bar down, kicking everyone out except for Wanda and Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Another!” Rio held a shot glass up from her spot laying on the bar on her stomach.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon poured water that she kept in an old vodka bottle into Rio’s glass and left it for her. “Here you go, hun, on the house,” she winked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda sat on a stool and laid her head on Rio’s back, studying Sharon. “You know us, not just from movies and stuff, but know us,” she slurred, attempting to watch Sharon closely but just seeing double.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon shook her head. “You’re both just very drunk,” she reassured as she closed out the registers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shook her head. “No, though you don’t know Rio.” She jabbed a finger into Rio’s ribcage. “But you know the rest of us.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was adamant. Her accent was thick, the way it was only when she was drunk, and she spoke in cursive.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wait!” Wanda sat up and almost fell over. Rio tried to reach out to catch her and almost fell off the bar herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You own the coffee and games place we used to go to, too! You’ve just always been here and around. You know Lilia! You’re a plant!” Wanda threw out the accusation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Three ferns in a trenchcoat!” Rio added, sitting up and lowering herself to a stool, almost falling to the floor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon laughed. “You caught me, yes. Lilia asked me to keep an eye on you two. Make sure you’re safe. Rio, keep drinking that vodka, Wanda, you too, " she instructed. Neither of them questioned her as they passed the bottle back and forth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda narrowed her eyes or tried to. They were already half closed from being heavily intoxicated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So this was all another set-up,” she gestured around, “another manipulation.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon shrugged, “Would you rather that or get completely wasted somewhere with zero security detail with no one looking out for you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was drunk. She hated feeling like an overprotected child, but she was also reasonable. She knew what could have happened to her and Rio because of their recklessness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She also knew exactly what Lilia had been doing, so she wasn’t too angry. It was not so much manipulating as protecting, even if just from the sidelines. Just like Agatha did because she had learned from Lilia and Lorna.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, she wasn’t a child who needed protecting, but she tended to make chaotic decisions. She was entirely too drunk to think logically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, if she had consumed the amount of alcohol she thought she had, she would be dead. She looked back at Sharon, realizing that yes, she spoke with an accent and that she spoke in italics, but it wasn’t as bad as she had thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How much alcohol did we actually have?” Wanda asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon smiled genuinely.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’ve probably had half of what you think you did, and I gave you something to make sure you wouldn’t have a nasty hangover tomorrow. Rio had a fourth of what she thought she did. She doesn’t have your Eastern European tolerance. I’ve also been watching her concussion. Neither of you is driving, though. I can drive you to the cabin and have one of my staff drive me back, or I can call you an Uber.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Leave it to Lilia. I still had a lot of fun. Thank you, Sharon. What about you, Ri?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned to Rio, who was lying across the bar, asleep.

      Wanda woke up to the early afternoon sun streaming in through the blinds. Whatever Sharon had given her, she felt fine. She was thankful she had showered before she fell into bed earlier and lay there remembering the events of the past few days. She was still hurt, yet was forming a better understanding, especially when looking at things from her mama bear point of view. An arm flopped across her stomach, and she froze. She didn’t remember going to sleep with anyone. She was both married and engaged. She did not need any more complications. Her eyes followed the arm up to find Rio’s face, and she relaxed. She then panicked again until she checked to see if they were both wearing pajamas. She reached over and shook Rio’s shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, Rio, wake up. We’re getting tattooed in a few hours, and we should probably at least text the womenfolk.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio yawned. “What happened last night? Why are we in bed together?” She eyed Wanda suspiciously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because clearly, you came to your senses and chose the better one. Duh.” She exaggerated her facial expressions and grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nope. Your future wife terrifies me. Hard pass.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled and got out of the bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think I came in here to talk, and we both fell asleep?” That was as much as she could remember, and Wanda agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s stomach growled. “Dress, eat, tattoo, then maybe we call them?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “Yes, it’s time we talk to those idiots.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We didn’t exactly handle things well, but ink therapy first,” Wanda confirmed, looking through her suitcase for something to wear.

      It was Monday afternoon and Agatha was dying on the set. She still hadn’t talked to Wanda or Rio and didn’t know when they would be ready to do so. She had seen all the speculation online about the shenanigans of the night before and she and Nat were packed and ready to go at any moment. They had been texting Alice at school and she was also panicking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had been their voice of reason, reminding the three anxiety-riddled women to wait for Wanda and Rio to summon them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It had been a long time since Lilia had been Agatha’s voice of reason, and it was jarring.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Nat’s phones dinged at the same time, finally. Nat grabbed them and read them both while she waited for Agatha to finish her scene.

      Nat handed Agatha her phone with the Taylor Swift lyrics. She then showed her The Killers lyrics that Wanda had sent her. Agatha gave her a sweet smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The song you two got caught kissing to, that’s romantic. Wonder what Alice got?”
     </span>

      As if on cue, Alice sent the screenshot of her text.

      Wanda handed over the chaos sigil she had doodled over to the tattoo artist. In her research, she learned that drawing your own chaos symbols held more meaning and power. Wanda had drawn inspiration from the chaos magick of their newest Marvel show and the brilliant costume designers, and how they infused symbology everywhere. Wanda looked back on her life and could see the chaos threads woven in, so why not create her own sigil powered with her intentions?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had drawn an angular letter W with an N overlaid. Each leg transformed into the arrows leading to the cardinal directions and imposing order onto the chaos. It was going on her ankle, and she liked it, love emerging from the chaos for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was far calmer than she would have expected at the tattoo parlor. Though she had considered a tattoo for years, she could not commit to anything that meant enough, or she didn’t think she would regret later. The moments from the last 30 years of death, destruction, and sadness that had fueled her previous tattoo designs that never materialized flashed through her mind. She took a pencil to paper and began to draw. “From death, comes life. And life, to death.” She muttered to herself as she erased a small portion.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put the pencil down. This was precisely what she wanted, meaning, design, and all. On the paper was the Egyptian eye of Horus, except where the pupil was supposed to be, was an ankh. It would be a small but powerful reminder on the inside of her wrist, right over her pulse point, that her life continued despite the death that surrounded her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They sent their messages, knowing it would take at least six hours for the other three women to join them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you ready for this?” Wanda was trying to hold her ankle still.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t think either of us has a choice now.” Rio could only use one hand to talk and didn’t like it. “Honestly though, I’m more ready to talk to Alice than Agatha. She still hasn’t looked at the contents of that big envelope and I think she’s waiting to do it together, knowing her as well as I do.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And, as much as I love Agatha and truly want a life with her, I could live without her in my life if I had to, she’s only been in it for a short time. I do not want to do that, though. Alice? She is a permanent fixture, and it would kill me. I don’t see how Agatha did that as close as you say she and Lilia were. So I know things will be much easier with Alice. This was a big thing, but I know she had her reasons, and we’ll be okay.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Everyone in the shop had been made to sign NDAs, brought over by Sharon with a quick smile and mouthing “Lilia” to the women. At least Wanda and Rio weren’t worried about any secrets being leaked, though they still spoke vaguely. Wanda frowned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I completely understand that for you. I can’t lose either Nat or Agatha. I just got Nat back, and I’m not losing her again. I do think Agatha will be the hardest one for me as well. I do not see how L did this all those years ago when she lost Lilia, though. It would absolutely wreck me to lose Agatha, but Nat? It’s an impossible choice, but I know which one I would make, and that hurts.” Wanda had a pained expression as she looked past Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s not a choice you will ever have to make. You know you two will be okay, even if it’s a hard conversation. She’s the sister who raised you, loves you no matter what, and would sacrifice herself if it meant saving you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew that was all true. It’s what she would do for Alice. She and Alice had always said their partners would have to understand that it was a package deal.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I would do the same for her and Alice for you,” Wanda said softly as her artist, a young guy named Spin, wiped away a tear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you going to forgive Agatha?” Wanda asked, making eye contact.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a heavy sigh, she was bruised and sore from yesterday’s incident and didn’t notice the supposed pain from the tattoo needles.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I just need her to be honest, but, Wanda? I have never loved someone the way I love Agatha Harkness. Romantically. No, it hasn’t been very long, but she’s my person. So, yes, I’ll forgive her. I’m not perfect either, but we need to get on the same page in every aspect.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stood up as Ghost, her artist, had finished. Wanda’s ink was complete as well. They completed their business and stepped back into the daylight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ready to go wait for those three?” Wanda asked, gnawing at a fingernail.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Might as well,” Rio said, resigned to their fates.

      Nat attempted to obey the speed limit as they headed to the cabin. Jen was not happy having to tell two different directors that their stars needed time. She also wasn’t excited about being put on teenage boy duty with Vision.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had a few upset teachers with Rio and Alice missing and handled them easily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gazed into the rearview mirror, which revealed the back of the vehicle. “When did you start a friendship with Lilia?” she asked Alice nonchalantly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “About two or three years in, I think? Once I tested the waters and knew I could trust her. We had been work friends, but that’s when we really started to become closer. You had already taken me in, but I had learned a bit through Mom’s letters and decided it was time. Don’t worry, I never gave her too much information about you, and she didn’t ask.” Alice did not feel like this line of teenage girl conversation was useful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, I just wondered is all. I’m glad Lilia has had you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What’s the deal with the chair?” Alice asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What do you mean?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lilia’s always had a different chair in that corner. Then I walked in yesterday, and that purple, wingbacked armchair is there with you sprawled in it like the useless lesbian that you are, and you can just feel that it was specifically for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice held Agatha’s gaze in the mirror.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t think I’ve heard this story. I know it’s your chair, but I haven’t heard the story behind it. When you and Lilia had what we called your friendship breakup, it was replaced. I was surprised to see it back out.” Nat threw in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hadn’t been inside Lilia’s house in nearly two decades and had no idea it had been removed. However, it didn’t surprise her. She smiled as she thought of the sixteen-year-old Agatha and her two much older guardians.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was sixteen and had won my court case. I sold my house and just about everything in it. Lorna bounced between men and either lived with them or Lilia so that she didn’t have to worry about losing a house and some of her hard-earned estate. I bought a condo and brand new everything. Lilia was keeping the house and would buy her current house a few years later, and Lorna decided to buy the condo next to mine. Anyway, Lilia needed a new chair for her house, and we stumbled into a cute little antique shop and came across that one. I fell in love with it but didn’t have a place to put it, and Lorna thought it was terrible. So Lilia bought it, saying it had an ' Old Crone’ vibe. It quickly became my chair. I don’t know how much alcohol I spilled or how many burn marks I put on that thing. I carved our initials in the bottom when I was seventeen and bored,” She laughed. What she had actually carved was:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maiden Agatha
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Mother Lorna
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Crone Lilia
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She did know I was coming,” Agatha added, looking at both women.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Damnit, Agatha, you better not make her put that chair back up,” Nat warned.
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      Nat pulled up and parked next to Rio’s SUV. The three of them sat there, gathering themselves for a moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Let’s do this,” Agatha said resolutely as they unloaded themselves from the car, ready to face the consequences of their actions. As they trudged up the short walkway, the cabin door swung open, and Rio flew out. Agatha immediately stopped and opened her arms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My love, I’m...” Her words died as Rio went past her, and she wrapped her arms around Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am so sorry! I should have told you.” Alice’s voice hit Agatha’s ears once she recovered from the snub.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat clapped her hand on Agatha’s shoulder. “Well, we know where you stand,” Nat whispered with a mixed expression.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just smiled and nodded. “I wonder if this is what Lilia felt like when Lorna and I put each other before her,” she whispered sadly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat turned Agatha back to the door and walked toward Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Worse, I’m sure. Lilia and Lorna knew each other before you.” Nat shrugged and dropped her hand, walking into Wanda’s arms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha froze.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For the first time, she realized how much pain she must have caused Lorna.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had forced Lorna to choose between Lilia and herself. And Lorna had chosen Agatha, abandoning what was arguably the most important relationship in her life in her friendship with Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lorna had never mentioned it. Not while she was alive.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Not in her letters.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Never.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat had said something to Wanda, causing her to look at Agatha like an injured puppy. Agatha began to cry with her new revelation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There were few people in this world that she had tried to never bring pain to and Lorna Wu was one of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She couldn’t even apologize.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s arms were around her in seconds.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice and Rio were sitting at the kitchen table across from one another. Rio had been crying as she put the last of the letters down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I can’t believe she wrote you ten letters and pre-dated them,” Rio said, wiping tears from her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There are more. She wrote like she was running out of time, and she was. She must have started writing months before she died.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice ran her fingers over the first envelope.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s a lot of feelings, Alice. Why didn’t you tell me? And why haven’t you read that journal? She obviously wanted you to! She’s mentioned it in every letter, she knew you still wouldn’t have looked in it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew it would be hard to do, but it was something Alice was going to have to do eventually.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll do it with you when you're ready,” Rio said quietly, looking up through her lashes as she picked at her nailbeds. Alice looked at her, her face full of regret.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am so sorry. I should have told you, shown you these, something. You never grieved when your parents died, and I felt bad if I grieved in front of you, and then I felt so alone.” Alice looked away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thought back to all those years ago. She had lived with Alice and Gran since she was fourteen, for the most part. Her mom and stepdad never really noticed she was gone unless they needed her for something, and that was the only time she went back to their apartment. At one point, they had moved and hadn’t told her where they had gone. She found their new place three months later. When she did go back to them, she returned to Norma’s a few hours later, in terrible condition. She wasn’t sure how many times Norma had threatened them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So when they died, Rio didn’t feel anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The police officers had come to Norma’s house and asked for Rio. It was ruled a murder-suicide. She was seventeen. She had just looked at the officers and said, “Thank you, is that all?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Norma disappeared to make a phone call, and Rio asked Alice if she wanted to go back to studying for their first test of senior year.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned back to Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I grieved Norma. I was devastated when she died and you disappeared. I didn’t grieve my mother because she hadn’t been my mother since I was six. Gran was my mother. I don’t even remember the guy she was married to. Alice, you met them, they were horrible. I grieved the loss of my mother once she lost herself in her addiction. Lorna never lost herself, and she beat it.”
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
      She shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t want to fight or argue with you. It was hard enough being mad at you. I finally joined you out here after ten years, and I am so thankful I did. I understand I wasn’t here to share everything with, but I still shared every single damn thing with you.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I understand you signed pieces of paper. I get it. But Alice, so did I, and I still told you about that blonde bitch. I even told her I was going to. I know you’re a rule follower, but it’s me. You know I wasn’t going to say anything to anyone other than Raven, and she doesn’t count.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wrapped her arms around herself. Wincing as she grazed a bruise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, and every time I said something about it, Lilia would just remind me that she and Lorna never let NDAs stand in the way of telling each other everything. Then it just got to where I felt it was too late. Right before you moved out here, she told me she would give me the school year to tell you and that if I didn’t, she would.” Alice stared down at the table as she pulled at the hem of her sleeve.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wait, what? Why would she tell me?” Rio was confused. Why did Lilia feel like she needed to give Alice an ultimatum? Alice sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She said sisters shouldn’t separate themselves and lead double lives, that someone hurts the other.” Alice popped her head up and looked across the table. “Mother fucker!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, but we can come back to that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, she was warning me about becoming her! The way she hurt my mom and Agatha!” Alice was tired of having life-changing revelations, but she was also understanding a lot more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Damnit Rio. That’s what I was doing. I was closer to Lilia than I let on, closer to Agatha and everyone, and had Jen and confided in her. I was living this whole other life and justifying it with the law when I should have roped you in.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, you admit that you were wrong, you’re going to be honest with me, we’ll read the journal, and we’re okay?” Rio summed everything up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There’s something else…” Alice continued.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio slouched and sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was jealous of Agatha. Yes, I wanted, and I want, you to be happy. Yet the jealousy I had when I found out how close Agatha was to Mom? It returned when you started spending so much time with Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled. “Then why didn’t you tell me, idiot? I will always make time for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice’s cheeks turned pink. “Because I was spending a lot of time with Jen in an official dating capacity.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio found that she really couldn’t be mad at Alice, and she never could be. Had it hurt that Alice had kept something so major and important from her? Yes. She understood why Alice had done it, though, and she wouldn’t hold it against her. Alice wasn’t just her best friend. She was the sister the universe had given to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put her elbow on the table between them and stuck her pinky out like she had done so many times since they had become friends when they were twelve.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Promise me that we will never keep secrets from each other again, no matter what we have signed. We will always be open about our emotions and feelings, and we’ll tackle the envelope when you’re ready.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio said, staring Alice down. Alice joined her pinky with Rio’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “On the graves of Lorna and Norma Wu, I pinky swear.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They squeezed each other’s pinkies before letting loose a fit of giggles.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If you children are done, then come in here,” Nat called from the other room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice tried to look at Rio seriously. “Time for the boss fight.” They both started giggling again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Alice had walked off into the kitchen for their chat while Wanda, Nat, and Agatha remained in the living room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had been nervous the entire drive and wanted to make sure everything was right between Wanda and Nat before anything else. Nerves pushed her to speak quickly, uncertain of how long they had before Rio and Alice returned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Angel, don’t be mad at Natasha, please. It was my fault. When she came and told me what she found that day, I immediately told her not to tell you. I didn’t tell her exactly why, just to trust me. That if you ever found out, I would take care of it. None of this is on her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was sitting cross-legged on the couch, arms wrapped around her stomach as if she were trying to hold herself together. She was trying to keep herself and her world from falling apart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was tired of crying, and she knew everyone else in this house was too. Yet, she felt the all-too-familiar sting at the edges of her eyes creeping up on her. She knew Agatha was trying to protect them, she always was, but she needed confirmation of something.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, why didn’t you want to tell me?” Wanda barely spoke above a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew she had to be honest, and she hated it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda, everyone knows you can’t keep a secret.” Agatha looked at her as if saying the words caused her pain. Wanda recoiled as if Agatha had slapped her. She closed her eyes as a tear slid out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha,” Wanda’s voice wavered. “When have I EVER let one of YOUR secrets slip to anyone that wasn’t Nat?” Wanda’s voice trembled as she blinked her eyes open, trying to fight back the tears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha furrowed her brows as she thought about it before it hit her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Never.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was not the best at keeping secrets, but when it came to Agatha? She only told Nat. Wanda had once told Agatha that she could trust her with anything. She had meant it with her entire being.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not. Once.” Wanda replied, voice hardening.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned her head sharply, looking at Nat. “You knew that! Just like with you! I tell the two of you everything, yes, so I can get it out, but that’s it. All other secrets are fair game. The two of you? Absolutely not.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, you are my best friend, my big sister, the person who will and has done anything and everything for me. I share almost everything with you. I would never do anything to hurt you, and then you betrayed me. I know it’s how we grew up and how we were raised, but it’s up to us to change that. To stop it. It’s not going to be easy, Agatha, but how many more of us do you have to hurt to realize what you’re doing?” Wanda was pleading for Agatha to hear her. Agatha had her hand to her mouth, genuinely listening to what Wanda was saying. Wanda had never spilled one of Agatha’s secrets, yet she had been adamant about not sharing with her. She had betrayed and hurt Wanda. Keeping things from her and causing herself to deal with so much pain on her own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was so goodhearted. So many bad things had happened to her, yet she still saw and found the good in life and people. Still defended Agatha no matter what she did. Bad ‘boy’ Agatha Harkness and girl-next-door Wanda Maximoff. Sure, Hollywood had played off of their dynamic for decades, and it was a classic buddy comedy trope, but it worked for them. She knew that the past really would have been different if she had taken the kid gloves off earlier and shared more with her earlier.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up and locked eyes with Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re right.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked shocked. “Someone record this.” She said, genuinely surprised at the omission.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I mean it, Wanda. I did become two separate people, and I hate it. I have been doing a lot of thinking. I do need Lilia back, we all do, and she and I have done a lot of talking already.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She brought the chair back out,” Nat interrupted. She had moved to Wanda’s side and was holding her hand. Wanda had allowed it and smiled. They would be perfectly okay.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t know she had put it up, obviously. It was there when I went over late Saturday Night, early Sunday Morning. Anyway, I don’t want to be that person anymore, and I’m working on it. You all deserve better. Our sons deserve better. Alice deserves better, Rio, that beautiful woman who has somehow not run away screaming, my future if she’ll still have me? Deserves the world. I’m lucky enough to have people around me who care and will call me on my shit, I fucking love you, Wanda. I am so sorry for being overprotective, and I will step back. I can’t promise to never be a little too overprotective, but I’ll work on it. I’m also working on the whole secrecy thing. I know sorry isn’t enough, but I am so sorry, kid.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had stood at some point to walk and gesture while she talked. She had come to a stop, hands stopped mid-gesture.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh! And please forgive Nat. She wanted to tell you she loves you more than anything, and I saw her full-body sob, and it was absolutely heartbreaking and terrifying, frankly.” Agatha added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda turned her head to look at Nat, “You full-body sobbed? Why, my love?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat brushed Wanda’s hair behind her ear and locked eyes with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re the sunshine in my day, Wanda. Do you know what happens to Russian assassins when they fail a mission and are compromised? They’re permanently retired. I saw you and immediately risked it all. The shady bitch over there pulled some major strings for everything to work out the way it did because she saw something spark between us. I’ve loved you since we were eighteen in a back alley, Wanda, as sappy and awful as that sounds. To lose you a second time after finally being able to have you fully? I couldn’t handle it. So yes, for the second time in my life, I was full-body sobbing on Lilia Calderu’s couch as Lilia held me. Before you ask, the first time was in the same spot, with the same woman, plus Lorna, because I thought I was losing you the first time.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat was caressing Wanda’s cheek. She had never told Wanda that she had struggled with the thought of losing her when Wanda fell for Vision. Agatha stood there listening to Nat, wiping tears away from the corners of her eyes. She would never forget that night. She knew exactly what would happen to Nat after Agatha escaped their encounter unscathed. Thankfully, Agatha knew a guy, or, well, Lilia knew a guy. That was also how the deal was made involving Agatha’s mother, and they had themselves a Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was fully crying as she leaned forward and kissed her fiancée.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It took me two years to figure out how I felt about you. I had you for five years before I married Vision, and then I was at arm’s length for twenty. We are getting married in a few months, Natasha. I am not losing you over a secret my stupid sister made you keep, okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded, sniffling slightly. “Okay. Te iubesc.” Nat leaned forward and kissed her again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda grinned. “Ya tebya lyublyu.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wiped away more tears. When had she become so sentimental?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hi, stupid sister here. Am I forgiven?” she asked, knowing she probably was, but asking anyway.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Get over here,” Wanda waved her arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sat next to Wanda and hugged her. “I’m so sorry, honey. I didn’t even realize what I’d been doing.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda tucked Agatha’s head under her chin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Aggie, I fucking love you too. Stop lying to your therapist and authentically work on the things you need to work on. That woman in there wants you to be her future, and I want that for both of you. I also want a niece, and you’re getting old.” Wanda smiled as Agatha pulled back to glare. “You have to start being honest with us and stop telling half-truths. I’m not saying she’s perfect. She’s not, but she’s perfect for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They turned toward the kitchen as the sound of giggling floated in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Looks like you’re up, slugger,” Wanda said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If you children are done, then come in here,” Nat called.
     </span>

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Alice walked in, leaning against each other and laughing over something. Rio’s laughter immediately died upon seeing Agatha. She hadn’t stopped because she was still angry, she was fighting her instincts to run to her and tell her all was forgiven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, they needed to genuinely talk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pulled away from Wanda as Wanda and Nat stood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Alice, come with us, we’re going to play pool.” Wanda gave Alice a look that told her she didn’t have a choice, so they left the room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Agatha, hugging herself, the look of hurt she had worn so many times over the last forty-eight hours returning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stood up, walking to Rio. She reached out and lightly placed her hands on her arms, waiting for resistance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was none.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stepped into Agatha, letting Agatha wrap her arms around her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I understand you’re angry,” Agatha started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not angry,” Rio murmured. “I’m hurt, Agatha.” She stepped out of the embrace and took a seat, still hugging herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I accepted that your ex was someone you occasionally worked with, someone I might meet in passing, someone in your orbit. But finding out it’s Lilia? That’s really something I needed to know. I know you didn’t want to change how I saw her, but Agatha. Don’t you think I would have found out eventually? What was going to happen the longer this went on? It would have been even worse. The lies, the omissions, they have to stop.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then, I need you to start telling me more about the past. I had no idea just how involved Lorna and Lilia were in your life. I just read ten letters to Alice from Lorna. Lorna telling Alice to give you a chance, to form a relationship with Lilia. Aside from Alice and Norma, you and Lilia were the best parts of her life, and you and Lilia convinced her to keep Alice. Thank you for that, by the way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>

      “It was just so much. I know I don’t need to know everything, but it also explains a lot about why you and Nicky get away with murder. Plus, she’s my boss, and I trusted her. I was forming a friendship with her. I respected her, Agatha!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s thoughts were everywhere, and the more she looked at Agatha, the more she wanted to kiss her and have Agatha tell her everything was okay. Agatha sat beside her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re right, and yes, I’ll record it for you if you want me to. Wanda and Nat gave me that same look. You have every reason to be hurt and I should have told you who it was, as it does have a major effect on our lives. You can still have a friendship with her and respect her, Rio. I understand the emotions are very conflicting right now, but you’ve read the letters and know how big a part of my life she played, other than that. I’ve spent a lot of time over there the past forty-eight hours, and fences are being mended. If you’re not okay with that, then I’ll stay at arm’s length.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This isn’t about that right now. This is about us. Rio, I want there to be an us. For a very long time, and for that to work, we have to be open and honest with each other, I agree. Wanda says I have to stop lying to my therapist and start working on some other things.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda’s right,” Rio interjected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She has an uncanny ability for that.” Agatha smiled. “Rio, I don’t want to fight, and I don’t want to argue. Over the past few days, I realized that I also became two separate people, like Lilia did. I know I need to work on myself, and I plan on doing that. I also know we need to work on our communication. I don’t want to watch Heartbreak Karaoke featuring you and Wanda on a grainy live stream every time we don’t communicate. However, it was highly entertaining, and now I do want to go to karaoke with you.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I digress. I want you to read the letters I have from Lorna. I want to be more open with you, and I want you to be more open with me. I love you, and I want this to work, whatever it takes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had never been much of a crier off-screen, yet these past few months had been brutal, and she blamed menopause. Rio huffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How do you do that? Completely disarm me to where I can’t be mad at you if I wanted to be? I’m still slightly wounded, but not nearly as much as I should be.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked. “I came by it honestly.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had done the same thing to Rio that Lilia had done to her. She hadn’t meant to, it just happened. Now that she thought about it, Lorna had the same ability.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have a feeling you learned it from the women who raised you.” Rio’s eyes narrowed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I learned a lot from them. They raised me. Back to us, I know we still have some things to work out and work through, as well as relationship dynamics to navigate. Are we okay for now while we build this to what we want it to be?” Agatha cupped Rio’s cheek and caressed it with her thumb.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha Harkness, where is this coming from all of a sudden?” Rio was slightly taken aback at the sudden relationship skills her girlfriend had.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Would you believe me if I said my son?” Agatha winced slightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, actually.” Rio was not surprised in the slightest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He recommended a podcast. The advice was not from him,” Agatha clarified.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m slightly disappointed in our son now,” Rio smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled at hearing Rio saying ‘our son’ again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “In case you hadn’t gathered, we’re okay for now. I love you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned in and kissed her, running a hand through Agatha’s hair. She could work with this. They could work through these things and navigate whatever came at them. Agatha placed her hand on the back of Rio’s head, only for Rio to hiss in pain and pull back. Her head was still tender, and the Tylenol from earlier was wearing off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her, worried. Why was she hurt?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, what’s wrong?” Her eyes scanned over Rio, noticing a few light bruises.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I flew off of a snowmobile yesterday,” Rio admitted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What? Why didn’t you tell me? Wait, why were you drinking last night? We need to get you checked out, baby. I am so sorry. Does anything feel broken?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s mind was racing. Rio had gotten injured almost a year after the last time she had been seriously injured. Rio started to laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Aggie, I’m fine. I have a mild concussion, and I’m banged up. We went to the first aid station. Very nice woman.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was still looking at her in horror. “I saw you on live streams! You were completely plastered! That’s not good!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda walked back in upon hearing Agatha panicking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We were at Sharon Davis-Hart’s bar, Agatha. Remember her? Anyway, she did a good job of making us think we were drunker than we were. She kept an eye on Rio and made sure she was fine.” Wanda sat on a couch catty-corner to the one Agatha and Rio were on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lilia,” Agatha stated. “Of course, she called Sharon. Well, still, that means it’s time for you to go to bed and rest your head.” Agatha was still concerned. She had read several studies and articles from medical journals about concussions when Nicky started playing football and did not play around with head injuries. Agatha helped Rio up, and they said their goodnights, walking up to Agatha’s old room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat and Alice had taken their bags up to their rooms. Agatha stepped into the room and passed echoes of herself through the ages. Teenage Agatha getting ready to go skiing, teenage Agatha making out with someone, teenage Agatha dancing around with Lorna and Lilia, young adult Agatha with a broken leg, laughing with Wanda, young adult Agatha dancing around and drinking with Wanda, Nat, Lilia, and Lorna.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had seen these memories playing out like old film reels downstairs, but she hadn’t expected it as much here. They all faded away when she realized Rio was in front of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, are you okay?” Rio asked, wrapping her arms around Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, just remembering the times I spent here is all. And, at least the room’s decor has been updated. I was serious about sleep and no strenuous activities.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio pouted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha got right next to Rio’s ear, her breath hot. “Once you’re cleared, we can be as
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       strenuous
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      as you want,” she purred before stepping back to change for bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tuesday morning had begun with Jen calling Agatha to get all of them to the nearest TV in the next fifteen minutes. She woke Rio and pounded on two bedroom doors. Ten minutes later, they were waiting for the news as Jen had instructed. Coffee was brewing in the background and they would eat after they watched whatever it was they were supposed to watch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Breaking news music played, and the graphic flashed across the screen as the announcer came on the screen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<em>
       “Lou Falco, famed supermodel and ex-wife of former NFL quarterback Shane Falco was found deceased at the infamous Island psychiatric prison complex early this morning…”
      </em>
</b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She didn’t know if someone had muted the TV, but Rio didn’t hear another word, and her body numbed at the words. She wasn’t sure how to feel. She didn’t want to be happy that someone was dead, but she was relieved to know she was finally safe, and that slightly concerned her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was how she felt when her parents died. However, back then, she was very young. That she didn’t find it concerning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The touch of Wanda’s hand brought Rio out of her spiraling thoughts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It doesn’t make you an awful person to feel safe,” Wanda said, leaning over the couch and rubbing Rio’s arms. “It makes you human, and that’s okay.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I just... three kids lost their mother,” Rio said, voice barely above a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice reached out and put her hand on Rio’s knee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ri, those babies haven’t had a mother in years. You even told me that when the oldest left for college, she went no contact and only talked to you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded as Agatha sat beside her and wrapped her arms around her, kissing her cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love you. You’re one of the strongest women I know, and I am here for whatever you need.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew she was surrounded by love, and yet again, it was comforting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was definitely time to get back to therapy, though.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was projecting all the warmth she could onto Rio. Inside, she had chilled to the core. Jen had known, what else had been set into motion? Agatha thought of the Russian assassin. She wasn’t sure how or when Nat had done it, possibly pulling some strings and making some calls. She never questioned Nat’s methods in all of these years, she was just glad everyone was safe. But, the ruthlessness and reach sometimes surprised her, and Agatha worked to keep it all to herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat continued to read the words that were scrolling across the screen. She had sent a few details here and there, but just like always, she hadn’t done the dirty work. Not enough to get into any serious legal trouble.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She hadn’t gotten her hands bloody in that way since Agatha had made her a part of their ragtag family twenty-seven years ago. Fights, framing, blackmail, and threats to make people disappear. Yet, she was never the one who followed through on that, and the women always dismissed her denials as necessary theater and plausible deniability. But Nat knew that was untrue.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Someone else just always got there first.

      Hours after the news broke, Rio sat on the couch, scrolling through social media. The internet was buzzing with news that Agatha and Wanda were not at their respective sets, videos of drunken, angry karaoke, pictures of someone that looked like Rio coming out of the small clinic on the mountain, and just pictures of WandRio in general.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were sticking with the nickname to everyone's annoyance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice had been texting back and forth with Jen all Tuesday morning, especially after the news of Lou’s demise had broken. Jen was trying to make sure no connections were made. She had already intercepted a picture of Rio from the previous school, coaching one of Lou’s daughters, hoping nothing else leaked. Combined with speculation from the internet, Jen was trying to put out fires everywhere and was drafting a statement to put out just in case.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The news had said that the supermodel succumbed to natural causes, and an autopsy would be performed. The woman had only been fifty-five, and Rio wondered what natural causes people would believe. She tried to focus on her mindless scrolling and read various things about her and her friends.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I hope Rio is okay after whatever happened while they were snowmobiling!

       Of course, these are the songs they’re singing.

<span>
      Rio made a mental note to check just how much information was on the internet and out there for the public. Maybe she could talk to Jen about that. She looked at what was currently trending, and her stomach flipped.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>

</p>
<p>

      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>

</p>

      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I feel so badly for her kids! They already had to see her go through that awful witchhunt of a trial, and then she was murdered!

</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She wasn’t murdered! She died of natural causes.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Please! At that place? At 55? She was murdered!
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Oh please. I doubt it. Don’t be disrespectful with your conspiracy theories!
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio paused. It’s what she had been worried about. There were always conspiracy theories when these things happened, especially when high-profile people died while incarcerated in any type of way. This was not good, and while their relationship had been buried and those directly around the woman had signed NDAs, the school itself had not required them as SHIELD did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This did not bode well for anyone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why do people keep saying nice things about this horrid woman?” Nat spat, tossing down her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can you wipe it all?” Wanda looked up at her from where she was lying in her lap. The two had been even more tactile than usual since apologizing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat smiled down at her future wife, “No, iubirea mea, that would look highly suspicious. Plus, that would be more of a Darcy-level task.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So? I’m sure everyone would blame the ex-husband.” Wanda’s gaze traveled to Rio. “How are you doing?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Trying not to vomit. I’m going to stay off social media for a few days. I can’t handle all of this, and my head still hurts. I wonder if Sharon will write a note so I can say this was mandated time off.” Rio wondered out loud, her head still throbbing, though she didn’t like to admit it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She already did, though Lilia had no problem with you taking time in the first place.” Agatha walked into the room and took a seat next to Rio. Agatha handed her the next dose of pain meds, and Rio took them gratefully, curling into Agatha after swallowing them with water.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice had been on the other side of Rio and sighed. “It’s not for Lilia. It’s so the Fencing Club doesn’t bully her about being the principal’s pet because she’s sleeping with you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha, Wanda, and Nat all turned to look at Alice with shocked expressions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was the first to speak. “What? How do you know about the fencing club?”
     </span>

      “Because I work there and have ears, Agatha. It’s not all of them, obviously, but it’s led by one or two of the more jealous types. Then the sorry bitches who just tag along to be cool and enjoy the commiseration of being among the many rejected by THE Agatha Harkness. Lilia can’t just fire them, though she wants to. Several teachers, other than myself, have come to her defense, notably Rogers and Carter.” Alice’s frown deepened. “Lilia won’t let me punch the smirks off their faces.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you in high school or teaching high school?” Nat’s eyebrows formed a question mark.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed dryly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s the same thing. English departments are the absolute worst, though. High School teachers are just as clique-ish as the kids.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So all of the women you slept with at SHIELD call themselves the fencing club after your tattoo?” Wanda asked incredulously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s high school for you,” Agatha confirmed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am so glad that part of your life is over. One less thing for Jen to worry about.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda had repositioned herself and was now leaning her head against Nat’s shoulder, her legs draped over Nat’s lap, with Nat absentmindedly running her hand up and down Wanda’s back, looking at Wanda like she was the only woman that existed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Seeing the two of them in this state, Agatha would never know that Nat had been somehow responsible for handing out consequences to some very terrible people over the years. It still blew Agatha’s mind how Nat could compartmentalize so well and easily slip back into that role.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat’s insistence that she hadn’t been the cause of all those unfortunate events was starting to wear at Agatha’s assurance that it was Nat. Something had started to poke at her mind and memories, and it was something she would have to explore later. Right now, Agatha was focused on her happiness for Wanda and relief that Wanda had been more upset than angry.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Speaking of my…our incredible fixer,” Agatha started and winced. The words ‘future sister-in-law’ had threatened to spill out, but she had thankfully been able to stop them. Seeing the smirk on Wanda’s face, however, told her that someone had noticed. Had she really begun to think of Alice as her sister by proxy of Rio?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Jen has had to handle several things already. It doesn’t look good when you leave a set and don’t come back or don’t show up to one.” Agatha cut her eyes to Wanda. “There’s also the speculation about the weekend shenanigans, my son’s posts about catsitting Raven, as the cat has a cult following, Vision was pictured on a date with Herb, and then she’s having to closely monitor any leaks about any connection to the wicked witch. It’s too late in the afternoon to drive back today, but we have to head back tomorrow and get back to everything. Alice just got married. We can’t make her a widow already because Jen had a heart attack.” Agatha smiled over Rio’s head at Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just make sure Jen gets a decent Christmas bonus,” Alice responded, shaking her head as she texted calming affirmations to her wife, who was currently ranting about the disease that was social media.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Consider your house paid for,” Agatha countered, nonverbally discussing it with Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was joking.” Alice rolled her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’re not,” Wanda added. “We haven’t put her through this much in a while, and if anyone does make the Rio/Super Psycho connection, it’s going to get worse.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had dozed off, leaning against Agatha. She knew that some of this was her fault. She hadn’t communicated, hadn’t talked rationally about anything, just grabbed Wanda and ran away. She was also the reason for the SF complication. Well, that was partly Lilia, wasn’t it? She had brought her out here after all. Hadn’t she?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her head was swimming, and she was tired. It was mid-afternoon. They could go back now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat up and yawned. “We could go back now,” She said groggily, stretching her arms above her head. It was Nat who spoke first.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, the damage has been done, and while it’s not that late, it will look better if we stay a bit longer in case the connection is made. It would be good for us to be seen around town this evening.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat spoke from experience, and while people wouldn’t necessarily suspect Agatha or any of their family if any of the stalking or connections came to light, it would still be better to establish alibis. As it was, Nat wouldn’t be surprised if they were questioned depending on the autopsy reports. Nat hadn’t spoken with Shane and didn’t know who had pulled off the hit. The restraining order and court appearance were enough that if Nat were a detective on the case, she would come sniffing around asking questions of the coven at least. Nat began to wonder if there was something or someone else at play. This wasn’t the first time that Nat had this nagging suspicion. To this day, she hadn’t figured out what befell the stalker who came after Wanda and the boys all those years ago. While Nat had let almost everyone assume it had been her doing, she had been clear with Wanda that that wasn’t a Nat operation. Still, no one asked questions and the event just faded into the background.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I agree with redheaded demon number two,” Agatha was saying. “How are you feeling?” Agatha looked at Rio, worried.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’d like to take an actual nap if that’s okay. Sorry.” Rio yawned. Although her head hurt, this did not feel at all like the concussion from last year. Rio reluctantly agreed with Agatha and conceded to a nap.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “As long as most of us are seen, it should be okay.” Agatha nodded, forehead wrinkled with worry. She looked over at Alice. “Are you coming, Mrs. Wu? Or is it Mrs. Kale?” She asked with a smile. Lorna would have been so happy for all of them, and Agatha had to swallow the lump in her throat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No one had called her Mrs. yet, let alone asked which last name she was taking. Alice felt her cheeks redden as she sunk into the couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We haven’t settled on last names yet and may just keep ours. We thought of hyphenating, but both Wu-Kale and Kale-Wu sounded off to us, and I really want to keep Wu. I’ll drop Gulliver, but I’m not losing Wu,” Alice and Jen had done this back and forth for almost three months now. Jen didn’t want to lose Kale for business reasons, and Alice had finally started feeling a connection to what her last name truly meant. They had their disagreements, but this had been the longest-running one.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please go with Wu-Kale and adopt a few dogs so I can call them the Wu-Kale clan,” Rio looked at her with pleading eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice failed to suppress her laugh. “Absolutely not, Method Man, go to bed.” She looked at Agatha. “As for the original question, I think I’ll stay here and keep an eye on this one.” She pointed at Rio, who was standing to go upstairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good,” Rio grabbed Alice’s hand and tugged. “Come tell me about the decade of your life I wasn’t here for,’’ Rio bent back down to give Agatha a quick kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please be very careful. You don’t have a full security detail. Don’t do anything Wanda and I would do. Te amo.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned quickly and disappeared upstairs with Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha watched her go and groaned. “That woman is going to be the death of me.”
     </span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen swore out loud as she hung up the phone and put her head in her hands, leaning back in her office chair. They were a few days away from the big move and her office provided the calm she needed, whereas the apartment was a mess of boxes and bubble wrap.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had completed damage control with two separate directors. One for Agatha’s TV show, and the other for Wanda’s movie. They had both continued filming scenes that didn’t include the two stars, and as long as they were at their respective studios on Thursday morning, everything would be fine. Wanda’s director, Maxwell, understood immediately and was very understanding. Wanda didn’t disappear or pull stunts. That was always Agatha’s department. Agatha’s director, Dottie, had been miffed, but once Jen explained that it was a matter of love, she softened.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen knew everyone’s weaknesses.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, it was not the directors that had Jen exasperated and anxious. It was Disney and Marvel. Fittings and table reads were scheduled to start soon, and they were not happy with two of their stars splashed all over the internet. Especially when their very wholesome star was now very suggestively participating in drunken karaoke.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, this was not good, and Jen had to do some serious explaining. Thankfully, just mentioning a particular lawyer’s name was enough, but Jen certainly did not want to call him. Team Wagatha had a team of lawyers. There were the lawyers for the more mundane things like Wanda’s divorce, contract negotiations, real estate, and NDAs. Then, they had their very special lawyer. Jen was certain the man was ageless. He kept everyone out of prison, dealt with anything that could go awry, such as breach of contracts, and expedited citizenships. He was the kind of lawyer that people were afraid of because he wasn’t crooked. He was just that good and terrifying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The minute Jen said, “I can always send their contracts over to their legal team. I’m sure the head of their team, Mr. Fury, would be happy to speak to you,” The executive on the other end of the line had gone silent. Breathing was the only thing Jen heard. “Oh? So you have heard of him? I can have,”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The executive cut her off. “No, Mrs. Kale, that won’t be necessary. Just make sure your clients are where they need to be when they need to be there.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The line had gone dead immediately.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Now, Jen had to let Fury know, and she did not want to contact him. Contacting him about these types of things showed weakness, and she hated that. She reached for her phone and opted to text.
     </span>

<span>
      Jen inhaled sharply. She hadn’t seen him at the reception though that didn’t mean he hadn’t been there. He was friends with Tony, another client. Tony had probably told him as he was one of the few people who knew of her connection with the powerful attorney.

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen made a mental note to put her walls back in place and interrogate Alice. Love had made her too soft. She was finished with this conversation, and she knew the longer she stayed here, the likelier it was for him to track her location and show up. Just because they had set boundaries didn’t mean he wouldn’t cross them. She slipped her laptop into her bag, turned off the lights, and locked up. Once in her car, she rechecked her phone just to see if Fury had gotten the hint that she was finished talking with him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He had not.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Man:

</p>
<p>
<span>
      She’s a great girl, Jennifer.

      I knew her mother.

      It’s part of why I
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      have this job.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha told her otherwise constantly, though Jen knew that in the beginning, his connection to this particular trio was precisely what landed her the job. Hollywood was filled with nepotism in all industries, and she hated being one of them, even if only a small number of people knew. She knew that Agatha wouldn’t take just anyone to be her sole representation for everything, but she still did everything she could and worked as hard as she could to prove to Agatha that she was more than her genetic makeup.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was also why she had been so insistent on not dating Alice. She didn’t want Fury to take credit for everything she had in her life. She tossed her phone into the passenger seat and drove back to the apartment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He’d probably take credit for the house on the compound, too.
     </span>

<span>
      Jen sat on the couch in the apartment, surrounded by boxes. She couldn’t wait to get everything into the new house on Saturday. The last message had irritated her. Where was that the last forty years? No. She didn’t have time for this. She was done with this conversation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She pulled out her laptop and began working on a statement for People.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sat in a booth at Sharon’s bar, drinking water, knowing that this wasn’t the time for alcohol, reaffirmed by the all-knowing look from Wanda as the thought crossed Agath’as mind. They had eaten dinner, wandered the area, and been highly visible. The way her notifications were going off told her it was working.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Have you two set a date?” Agatha asked, trying to be happy for them but completely focused on her relationship.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not yet. The divorce isn’t finalized until June twenty-sixth,” Nat answered, drinking some type of stout.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The wedding is June twenty-eighth,” Wanda said decidedly. “It’s the last Saturday of Pride. We can make sure to be home from filming for a few days. I’ve already checked the filming schedules and with the director. We’ll have a small wedding. I was thinking of either the beach house or the compound.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For once, Nat had nothing to say. She just sat there slack-jawed and stunned. This was a side of Wanda she hadn’t seen. Her first wedding to Vis had been a production, and Wanda had been indecisive about every little detail, down to her shoes. Nat looked at Agatha, who seemed more attentive now, before turning to her equal half and putting her hand on Wanda’s knee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why the rush?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked down at her hands where she was picking at her cuticles, an old habit she occasionally reverted to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “With the recent revelations and my self-reflections, I don’t want to spend any more time as anything but your wife, Nat. Girlfriend, partner, fiancée, that’s not what I want to be. I’m more sure about this than I was about having kids. There are still days I’m not so sure about them.” She turned and smirked at Nat. “Besides, what better way to end Pride month than with a lesbian wedding?” Wanda leaned over and quickly pressed her lips against Nat’s in a chaste kiss. “Please?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat pressed her forehead against Wanda’s. “I will never tire of hearing you refer to yourself as my wife, and we’re not even married yet. Yes, June twenty-eighth, whenever and wherever you want.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat kissed Wanda again, sliding her hand into Wanda’s hair to deepen the kiss. Agatha loudly cleared her throat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey kids, this is a very public bar, and your pictures and videos are already being posted on the internet. I already have two texts from Jen that say, “Oh God, make it stop,’ and ‘kill them now’”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda finally pulled back, laughing. “Tell Jen it’s my turn to be a menace.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pressed stop and sent the video. “You told her yourself.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stuck her tongue out and did a little dance on her side of the booth as if bragging. Wanda just shook her head. She was glad that they were acting like them again. She took a drink of the fruity concoction the bartender had made for her before looking back at her sister.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So when are you proposing?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha choked on air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Excuse me? It hasn’t even been a year!” Agatha exclaimed after she recovered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shrugged. “Okay, and? Get it together, Harkness.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not happening. I am, however, officially asking her to move in. We have discussed that at least, so I’m going to make it official.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was proud of herself. It was Wanda’s turn to choke on something., “What? When?” She spluttered as Nat just smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you really surprised? They’re always over at each other’s places anyway, and with Alice moving to the compound this weekend, they can still carpool.” Nat commented.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes at Nat before answering Wanda. “It would be in June, so, you know, all the gayness during Pride. I want to ask her on my birthday.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s on Friday. That’s THIS Friday!” If Wanda hadn’t been in a booth, she would have fallen off her chair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know when my birthday is.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicky’s going to be so excited. He loves that cat,” Nat smiled, leaving the unspoken “and Rio” in the air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve never lived with a partner before,” Agatha realized out loud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had always shot that request down, no matter how many times Agatha brought it up. Agatha had lived with Wanda and Nat, and Lorna had lived with her a few times in between men before she stopped marrying them and finally bought her own place and just dated. She had shared places with other actresses while filming, but this would be a first for her. Agatha started laughing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am nearly fifty-two and have done things in the strangest order my whole life. I
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       divorced
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      my mother and struck out on my own at 16. I technically adopted a teenager at twenty-two,”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Excuse you, a sibling,” Wanda interjected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She did raise you,” Nat pointed out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shut up,” Wanda retorted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was in the world’s most messed up relationship for ten years, had a kid on my own, my real mother was only thirteen years older than me and had a child that I took in later, I adopted the person hired to kill me, and now she’s marrying the other woman I raised, I fell in love with the best friend of another child I took in…” Agatha stopped as she snorted. “Oh my God, it’s this entire universe. I should chart it. I’m like the sun.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda just shook her head. “It’s like you’re drunk on your own absurdity. We’re taking you home.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha raised her head and looked around. “Wait, where’s Sharon?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As if summoned, the woman appeared beside their table.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m just dropping by for a second. I was told you were here and wanted to check-in. Is everything okay?” Sharon was eyeing Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. “We were just about to leave and get back to Rio and Alice.” Wanda and Nat slipped from the booth and hugged the older woman, sensing that Agatha and Sharon needed to talk for a few minutes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Everything okay with you and Rio?” Sharon asked as Agatha stood, and the two whispered together conspiratorially.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It will be,” she stopped next to the door and turned to face Sharon, looking down at the shorter woman. “Thank you for watching over them and taking care of her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’ll always be that sixteen-year-old kid causing trouble, Aggie. Global award-winning star or not, and Lilia asked me to keep an eye out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s smile softened. “How are things going between you two?” she gave Sharon a knowing look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon gave a sly smile. “How did you know?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A hunch, and I know Lilia,”
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Well, I did.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s casual, has been for a few years. We spend time together when she’s here, or I’m in LA. We have a good time together, and that’s it. See other people, that kind of thing.” Sharon’s face said it was moving past casual for her, and Agatha knew she was going to be poking and prodding at Lilia soon.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Maybe she’ll retire soon and move up here,” Agatha tried to be hopeful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The older woman just scoffed. “She’ll never leave that haunted house of hers.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “At least the ghosts are friendly.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon locked eyes with Agatha, her voice tinged with sadness, “The ghosts of the living are never friendly, Agatha.”

      Rio had fallen asleep while talking to Alice, during which time she had learned more about Alice’s ten years in the city before Rio’s arrival. When Agatha introduced Jen and Alice, they quickly became friends. Then, when Alice found she had no one to talk to about everyday life at SHIELD, she had Jen, who often had dealings with the school and had signed the very same NDAs. They grew closer, and Alice woke up one day and realized she was in love with Jen. By then, she valued her ever-growing relationship but didn’t want to ruin anything. Alice hadn’t dared to do anything until Rio came back into her daily life and gave her that push.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice recounted how she decided she needed to build a relationship with Lilia to learn more about Lorna and that she had built a closeness with Agatha but still kept her at a slight distance. Rio had fallen asleep as Alice’s little spoon while clutching the geriatric moose while Alice was telling her about different pranks the boys had played. Rio usually did not sleep like the dead. That was Agatha’s job. She hadn’t noticed when Alice left, tucking a blanket around her before she went.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and the redheaded wonders returned to see Alice watching crime documentaries.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is Rio still asleep?” Agatha asked, already on her way up the stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, do not wake her up, Agatha Fucking Harkness!” Alice yelled as Agatha vanished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda and Nat joined Alice as the expert on the television was explaining how the murder was committed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat scoffed. “He’s giving the wrong directions.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Babe, they’re not directions,” Wanda looked at her in amusement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They’re still wrong.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha quietly slipped into the bedroom and stood at the side of the bed, watching Rio as she slept, curled up with the ancient moose, before she joined Rio on the bed and pressed herself against Rio’s back. She carefully draped her arm over Rio’s torso and covered the younger woman’s hand with her own, placing a kiss on the back of Rio’s neck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha thought about her little family and how she had watched Wanda and Nat while they were out, as well as the look on Alice’s face when she texted Jen. The way she oversaw and, at times, facilitated those journeys over the years, the people she loved and cared for the most had all found love.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was no reason why this couldn’t finally work out for her, and she was fully committed to it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love you,” she whispered into Rio’s ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Love, too,” Rio mumbled, rolling over and nuzzling into Agatha’s chest, moose in between them, like an anchor to reality.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How’s your head, my love?” Agatha ran her hand up and down Rio’s back and kissed her forehead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Better, hurts less.” Rio forced her eyes open as she brought herself out of her slumber to look at her girlfriend. Agatha’s beauty disarmed her momentarily. She was so in love with this woman. Then thoughts and questions from the past several days flooded her mind and out of her mouth as though she hadn’t just woken up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The two times we ran into each other at Norma’s, why were you really there? I remember running into you and then pretending like we hadn’t bumped into each other the night before when Norma introduced us or reintroduced us. What was that about?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha ran a hand through Rio’s hair, not showing sadness at a ruined moment but committed to telling the truth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, the first time was to bring Lorna back to LA but also to tell her I was pregnant. She was so excited. I just panicked the next morning, not wanting anyone to think I was creeping around the night before. The second time, she had run after finding out she was sick, and I came to bring her back and tell her we were fighting it together. It was another panic moment. You were also of age then, and I did not need an interrogation from Norma. She knew about the relationship with Lilia and kept telling me I was going to rob a cradle one day. She’s laughing from beyond the grave, I’m sure of it.” Agatha smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I remember every detail of both times. I couldn’t share either time with Alice. I knew she’d make fun of me forever. As it was, she teased me over how much I blushed the times we officially met. There are only a handful of things I’ve kept from Alice, those being two of them.” Rio fought the urge not to bury her face in her hands. “Did I ever tell you that you were my gay awakening?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha snorted. “I have heard that millions of times, but to hear it from you is a completely different feeling,”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio could feel her cheeks reddening. “I was young, maybe seven or eight? It was a high school slasher flick you were in, and you had on this purple bikini, coming out of the water, and it was that moment when I felt something and thought, ‘I like girls.’ As I got older, it never went away, and I never felt the same way about boys. So, I can honestly say I fell in love with the woman that made me realize I was gay.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled. Something about knowing she was the person who first made Rio realize she liked girls made her heart stutter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Full circle, huh?” While Agatha’s words were teasing, her eyes were not. “That was a terrible movie. You were way too young to watch it, and I was in an awful headspace. I am glad you watched it, though, and that seeing me on a screen helped you realize your attraction to the fairer sex.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked down at the comforter in thought for a moment before looking back at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It wasn’t just your looks, Agatha. It was the way your personality shone through. I went to the library after that and looked up every interview you had done, anything I could find on you—newspaper articles about your court case, any newsreel. Even though I was young, I had this thirst for knowledge and a slightly obsessive nature. I had been forced to grow up already, and I connected with something in you. I needed to know more, and I found all of that out. You immediately became my favorite actress. While other little girls in 1997 were obsessed with boy bands, I was obsessed with learning about how you had advanced queer rights, changed laws, and continued to be yourself and not shy away from it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Meeting Alice and being taken in by her and Gran was one thing. I was starstruck the first time I met Lorna, but Norma tried to make sure we weren’t there when Lorna was detoxing. Your presence nearly killed my baby gay self.” Rio laughed and then changed the subject quickly to cover up her awkwardness. “Who gave you this senior citizen?” Rio motioned with the moose she held, assuming there was a story.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let Rio get away with the topic switch and looked down at the moose, a hint of sadness in her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was sixteen, Evanora was in prison, and it was technically my first Christmas on my own, even though I wasn’t. Lorna and Lilia brought me up here and we spent Christmas up here. I saw a moose in the wild for the first time. It was huge and scared the life out of me. I was skiing and almost went into a snowbank. So they presented me with the moose here. They thought they were hilarious.” She smiled at the memory.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Does he have a name?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was sixteen…” Was the only answer Agatha gave, her face flushing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn’t help but laugh. “You named him horny, didn’t you? Those are antlers, Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was sixteen!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s laughter died out as she cupped Agatha’s chin and made Agatha look at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I want to hear about them and the past, Agatha. I want to hear more stories about Nicky as a kid and what playing Elphaba was like. Reliving the past can hurt, I know, but that’s how we keep those memories alive,” Rio placed her thumb in the middle of Agatha’s cleft chin. “I love you, Agatha, and if I have to tell you that every hour of every day for you to get it through your thick skull just how much I mean it, I will. The good, the bad, the ugly, I’m here for it all, Agatha Fucking Harkness.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s hand slid from Agatha’s chin to her chin and around to the back of her head as she moved to press herself against Agatha, who moved the Moose.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lorna,” Agatha replied. “I actually changed my middle name to Lorna.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She clarified as she pulled Rio closer and drew her in for a kiss.
     </span>

<span>
      The five women had returned to their homes in the city on Wednesday to prepare for their return to their various places of employment on Thursday. Rio, however, was not allowed to return until Monday due to her recovery. Sharon and Lilia’s orders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had put out a statement in People that had gone over well, and the celebrity-obsessed internet was making video edits of either one deceased supermodel or two women singing drunk karaoke. With everyone returning to their normal lives, Wanda had one issue that needed resolution.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda hadn’t technically asked Lilia if they could meet. Instead, she texted the older woman and declared when she would be at her house and that Lilia needed to be there. Wanda, being more polite than her counterparts, though, at least announced her arrival as she crossed the threshold into the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lilia, just what the hell were you thinking!” Wanda yelled as she stormed in, volume and anger surprising even herself. Her plan to walk in calmly and talk this out flying right out the window. This was Lilia, Wanda reminded herself. They needed her, and she was family. And family wrongs must be addressed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was more than just her best friend. She was her sister.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had been there through everything. Agatha had taken her in and taught her almost everything she knew. Agatha held her through nightmares through heartbreak and had been there when the boys were born. Agatha was one of the most important people in her life, and to know she had been hurt so deeply by Lilia, of all people, and under Wanda’s nose activated every protective instinct in Wanda she possessed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was furious.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia sat at the kitchen table, legs crossed at the knees, drinking her tea, a stack of papers set to the side. A cup of tea sat across from her next to a plate of homemade pizzicati.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was not surprised to get your text, Wanda. I just didn’t know
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       when
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      I would get it, ceai?” Lilia gestured toward the seat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda stood and glared at Lilia, awaiting an answer. Lilia exhaled sharply through her nose.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve been asked that question a few times the past few days, and I honestly don’t think I was. Not clearly, anyway.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, that’s fucking obvious!” Wanda spat, full accent on display.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s accent came out on three occasions. When she used it with Nat on purpose, when she was drunk, and when she was furious.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her accent had not come out with Agatha or Nat the other night. She had been upset with them, but not to this level.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had only seen Wanda like this once before, and she remembered that day with clarity.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       When Wanda was stalked, the stalker went further than any of them thought he would.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       He threatened the boys. Agatha had been out of town when the threat to the boys had been made, and Wanda immediately appeared at school. She walked a path across Lilia’s office, speaking three different languages, like a caged tiger.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       The body washed up on the beach a week later.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Right now, Wanda stood, eyes attempting to set Lilia on fire.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “In my country, you would be food for pigs. I hear it’s the same in most of the American South.” Wanda continued. Her arms were crossed, and she was tapping her foot. She looked every bit the disappointed mother but much more frightening, especially with the Romanian accent.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How could you do that to her? You left her when she needed you! You helped raise her! You had a relationship with her?! I’m still both shocked and disturbed by that. If the two of you had just communicated at all, none of this would have happened!” Wanda threw her hands in the air with a cry of exasperation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia opened her mouth to speak, but the words died before leaving her mouth when Wanda held up her hand to silence her, and the younger woman continued.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s what everything boils down to, isn’t it? No one knows how to talk to each other?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I-” Lilia started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s glare just intensified as she continued talking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You can speak when I’m done,” Wanda said sharply. “Look at what you did to yourself, Lilia! Was it worth it? Was playing this game and losing Lorna worth it? I saw how it broke Lorna those last few years. Every time Nicky did something for the first time, she and Agatha both wished you were there to witness it, Lilia. The looks they gave each other and the sadness they communicated. I knew, maybe no one else did, but I understood that you were missing. I never knew what happened until this past weekend, and no one would tell me, but damnit Lilia. I can’t imagine how I would have felt if Agatha hadn’t been there for those moments. Or at least watch videos of them. I missed you being there with the twins’ milestones, too, but I knew I could still bring them over here occasionally until they learned to talk and rat me out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda still spoke from a place of anger but softened when she talked about the boys. It hardened again when she jumped to the next topic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was so hopeful when you were at the hospital when Nicky was born! Lorna was sober, and I know you would have been happy for her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia spoke up then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lorna told me when she sent the two of you back up with Agatha. I was so proud of her. I texted her later, telling her as much. She never responded. I knew she was sick at the end. She came to my house a few months before it happened. She wanted to apologize for the things she did. I said something stupid, and instead of being us again for the last few months of her life, that was the last time I saw her. I’m sorry Agatha didn’t tell you what happened.” Lilia blinked the tears back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s face hardened. “I’ve forgiven her because that’s what family does, Lilia. You and Lorna let your pride get in the way. For the two women who taught Agatha and me how to be a family, you two didn’t listen to yourselves.” She moved to drink her ceai. Her voice was hoarse from talking so much.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I also haven’t told you it’s your turn yet.” She replaced the cup on the table. “How could you destroy her like that? I have watched her for eighteen years continue to give her body to near strangers night after night because she wouldn’t form a connection with anyone. Only sex. She would constantly tell Nat and me that sex was all she could do. I watched her scream along to angst-filled songs that ripped at her heart and cry over old pictures when she didn’t think anyone was watching. I watched her live with that pain, Lilia.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      How Wanda was still in control of herself, she wasn’t sure.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda, I,” Lilia tried again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nope. When Lorna died, she needed YOU, Lilia. Not me. YOU. I’m a big enough person that I can admit that. Hell, we all needed you, but Agatha especially. She still wears that locket to everything, and even when you can’t see it, she has it on her. Yes, she told me what it means. I asked her once when I was younger. She may have removed your hair from it, but she still has it.” Wanda had walked the length of the kitchen twice and was boring a hole into Lilia’s soul.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had known that Agatha had removed her lock of hair. Lorna had told her. Lilia did not, however, know she had kept it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s anger was beginning to wane somewhat, but only because she was so tired of all of this. “You didn’t just hurt Agatha. Your actions hurt all of us. She trusted you, and yes, she is beautiful and alluring, but damnit Lilia. You two couldn’t have kept it in your pants?” She spat, her face had lost the scarlet it had held while she was angry, and she had lost much of her steam. “You may speak now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia looked up at her with pride. The one they had always protected had become a protector.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You have grown into an incredibly strong woman, Wanda. I am so proud of you. You’re one of the few people who Agatha will let fight for her because she fully trusts you. I know you are outraged with me, and I would be too. I am, still. You watched Agatha and Lorna go through it, not understanding what happened, and now that you know that I caused it. The one person who was never supposed to cause any of them, or you, harm, you’re angry. You’re also sad.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t think you can Calderu your way out of this, Lilia.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia scoffed. “Oh, I know I can’t. You’re going to keep a very watchful eye on me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Absolutely.” Wanda’s accent was dissipating, but she was still weary of Lilia. She loved the woman, but Lilia was right. Wanda would be watching her. Wanda slid into the kitchen chair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I never meant to hurt anyone, and as they say, hindsight is 20/20. If I could undo it all, I would. However, I did, and I have to own up to that. I did hurt everyone I love and I can never fix things with Lorna, which is why I want to at least try and repair things now. I am so sorry for what I did to all of you. I needed all of you in my life, and I’m glad I had you in the small capacity I did. I’m sorry she kept it from you, but that’s my fault. Lorna and I taught her to keep things close to the vest, and she did.” Lilia left out the hair tidbit and watched as Wanda thought everything over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And Rio?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia smiled warmly. “I did not plan on them falling in love. That’s a little too manipulative, even for me. For example, when I scheduled Morgan and Nicky to be in the same classes since pre-k, I was trying to mend the relationship between Tony and Agatha. Certainly not matchmake children. They’re children.” Lilia hated that someone had even suggested it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took a bite of one of the jam-filled cookies before her. “What is the story between Tony and Agatha? She’s never told me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A memory flashed across Lilia’s face as she shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ask again. I’m sure she’ll tell you now. Back to the topic at hand, I’m glad you and Agatha can move past things and that you and Rio get along so well. You also didn’t find all of my hiding places in the cabin.” She smirked, referencing the mics, “Hopefully, you and Nat can set a better example of healthy relationship dynamics. Wanda, it’s my fault she never told you about us. I insisted that we not tell anyone. I’m the one who told Lorna, and even then, Lorna acted like she figured it out. When in reality, I told Lorna because while I told myself she’d be happy for us, I knew she’d be upset, and God was she. I destroyed our relationship over it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      What I learned, Wanda, is that if the person you have been closest to for the majority of your life tells you that something is a terrible idea, you should listen. Chances are, they know you better than you know yourself. Lorna was right, and she kept telling me I was ripping Agatha and myself apart. Unfortunately, we’re all stubborn and hard-headed here.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m truly happy for Agatha and Rio if that’s what you're truly worried about. I have no romantic feelings for Agatha anymore. Like I told Rio, and she, I’m sure, told you, I love Agatha very much, but it’s the way I always loved her. Not the infatuated love I had for her once. I care for her, for all of you. I love all of you. Being in Agatha’s life in a larger capacity doesn’t just depend on Rio, and I know that” Lilia eyed Wanda, measuring just where she was now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked at the now empty plate. Damn Lilia and her culinary skills. “Lilia, I love you, and we need you in our lives and our family,” Wanda’s eyes turned dark, “But if you cause any more harm to my sister or anyone in this family, it won’t be Nat that you’ll have to worry about.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had never been afraid of Wanda. The woman was kind and gentle. She once squashed a spider and cried.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      At this very moment, the sweet redhead terrified her.

<span>
      Agatha had decided long ago to only have large celebrations for her birthday every five years. She had told Rio no gifts, though Agatha had a feeling she wouldn’t listen. No one ever did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had arrived home late from filming that Friday evening and had told her family that if they insisted on celebrating, then cake only. Maybe dinner. Rio was still restricted from too much activity until Sunday, which, while disappointing, just meant they’d have a bit of a busy week.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was slightly shocked that only Rio’s car sat in front of her house, though she knew better.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She walked into her house, the distinct smell of Lilia Calderu’s cooking in the air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia was in her house, on her birthday.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Most likely making Pasta Alla Norma.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It’s what she made Agatha every year for her birthday. Starting when she turned fifteen, Evanora had always spent Agatha’s birthday at church. Praying it would be Agatha’s last. Lorna and Lilia snuck Agatha out of her house and threw her a birthday party.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her very first one.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha walked into the kitchen to see her family, original members, and new additions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I said no celebrations unless it was cake.” Agatha tried to act annoyed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You said dinner was a maybe, so we took that as a yes,” Rio kissed her on the cheek. “Happy birthday.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      In all actuality, Agatha loved it. She had missed celebrating with Lilia. It just felt right. There was still work to be done, but things were improving. The kids didn’t even ask about her presence. They were smart. They could figure it out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Herb had fit right in, and the boys seemed to like him. Vision was taking things slowly with him, and Jen had handled their date expertly in the People article.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Vision has always remained faithful to Wanda, though now that they are separated, he is free to date whoever he likes and has his family’s full support.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The three additional teens were a stable fixture. No one knew where Cassie and Tommy would end up, but they made great friends either way. Wanda had a betting pool going.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The house was filled with noise, celebration, and love. There was cake and Lilia’s cannoli, another birthday staple. Rio somehow managed to get icing on her nose, and Agatha kissed it off. Morgan told them to get a room. Nicky shouted that those were his mothers she was talking about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After dinner, entirely too much sugar and the presents which slightly annoyed Agatha, the teens made off to the clubhouse, and the men departed. The kitchen had been cleaned when Agatha wasn’t paying attention and suspected that was Wanda and Lilia’s doing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia took Agatha’s arm. “Walk me to the door,” she instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Where’s your car?” Agatha asked the question that hadn’t been answered yet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We parked at Wanda’s, and the kids started bringing our cars over when they left a few minutes ago,” She winked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s dark outside. The twins are still fourteen!” Yes, the four freshmen were being taught by Vision, as he was the village driving instructor, and Cassie and Eddie had turned fifteen and had learner's permits, but that didn’t make it safe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, they don’t have to leave the compound. It’s not far, they’ll be fine. How old were you when you learned to drive?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Different times,” Agatha conceded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They stood on the front porch when Cassie and Tommy drove up in Lilia’s black BMW. “I remember a time when you tried to pretend you only made a principal’s salary,”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I invested very well in the nineties and sold when Apple hit its peak.” Lilia lied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sure you did.” Agatha turned and hugged the shorter woman. “Thank you. For everything. We’re not…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But, one day.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “One day.” Lilia gave her a tight squeeze, waved to the kids, and left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky walked up to her and looked at her closely. He suspected that he had connected the right dots, and he did not like the picture they made. “Scandalous, Mom. I need brain bleach.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, go have the party I’m pretending I don’t know about. No driving, take everyone’s keys, and for the love of God, don’t let anyone post on social media. Turn off all the routers, confiscate and lock up cell phones.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Already the plan, love you.” he kissed her on the cheek and turned to where Morgan was waiting for him. The others had already left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What’s the rule?” she called after them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Misdemeanors, not felonies!” They called back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha walked back into the house as Alice and Jen were leaving.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Happy birthday, you old hag,” Jen said as she hugged her. “Don’t forget, you promised to help tomorrow.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know I did. You overgrown prune,” Agatha released her and hugged Alice, “Thank you both. I love you, mainly you, Alice. We’ll see you tomorrow.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She walked into the living room, where Rio and Nat looked at Agatha as if she were in trouble, and Wanda looked like a disappointed mom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did you tell our boys that they could have a party?” Wanda asked, her voice strained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked shocked. “Why, absolutely not!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then why did Kamala Khan’s mom just email me a signed NDA and consent form?” Wanda held up her phone. Agatha did not have an answer to that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What? I don’t know anything about that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It appears that because the children are under eighteen and therefore cannot sign legal documents themselves, the people attending the party were given NDAs and consent forms to have signed by their parents. So that there is legal documentation that they were allowed to be there no matter what occurred and that they would not talk about it or post about it on social media.” Wanda explained, still trying to process.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “At least they’re smart,” Agatha offered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha!” Wanda reprimanded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, come on, Wanda, let them be kids. It seems like they only invited their close friends, friends with parents we know. They’re all smart kids.” Agatha reasoned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve already tapped into the mics and cameras in the house,” Nat was looking at her phone. “So far, so good.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda dropped her shoulders in defeat. “I’m still worried.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat stood, taking Wanda’s hand. “Then let’s go home and de-stress,” She grinned, whispering into Wanda’s ear and leading her towards the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Goodnight, you two. Love you both. Happy birthday, old lady.” Nat waved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Rio both smiled as Agatha held out her hand to Rio and led her up the stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why so many cameras in all the houses?” Rio wondered out loud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Liability, protection, several reasons other than basic security and just keeping an eye on things. People love to make things up, especially when they think money or fifteen minutes of fame may be involved. So, we get ahead of it and make sure they can’t.” Agatha shrugged. “I’m so used to being in front of cameras and having my whole life scrutinized that I forget they’re there. It’s an encrypted closed-circuit system, so only certain people have access. With the clubhouse, it’s like baby monitors for teenagers.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had changed into sleep shorts and a tank top and slipped under the covers into bed. Rio joined her, clad in a Stevie Nicks shirt and Snoopy boyshorts. She looked at Agatha, startled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are there cameras in this house?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, we don’t invite people we don’t trust into our private residences, and if it’s questionable, we have them sign an NDA.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wanted at least one place where she wasn’t in front of a camera, and home was it. The Clubhouse hadn’t been outfitted with cameras until the boys started hanging out there in middle school.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thought back to the very first night she had spent with Agatha. She had never signed anything. “Agatha, you never made me sign an NDA,” Rio watched her expression carefully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha drew Rio into her lap and regarded her lovingly. “I must have had a good feeling about you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned in and pressed a kiss to Rio’s lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio kissed her back, parting her lips as the kiss intensified. Agatha’s tongue licked the roof of Rio’s mouth, and the backs of her teeth, and rolled against her tongue. Rio moaned at the sensations and readjusted to where she straddled Agatha’s thighs, slightly breaking their kiss so they could breathe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took the opportunity to pull back, her hand firmly planted on the small of Rio’s back, holding her steady.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not cleared until Sunday.” She reminded them both, her voice husky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha, I haven’t had to take anything in twenty-four hours. I’m fine.” Rio whined, fingertips gliding across the expanse of Agatha’s stomach under her tank top. “Besides, there are ways we could do this that aren’t too strenuous…” Rio let her unspoken plea linger in the air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shuddered at the light touch, running her free hand through Rio’s hair and lightly gripping the back of her neck. If they were doing this, it would be on Agatha’s terms. She brought their lips together again in a slow kiss, savoring the feeling of Rio’s lips against hers. She moved her hands to the hem of Rio’s shirt, removing it and tossing it into the darkened room. Agatha looked up at Rio, running her fingers from Rio’s temple to her jaw.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You will tell me if it’s too much or if you start to get sore, a headache, anything, understand?” Agatha leaned forward, planting open-mouthed kisses across Rio’s chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio moaned and rolled her hips against Agatha’s thighs. “Yes, baby,” she gasped when Agatha bit down on a hardened nipple.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Already so needy, I can feel you against my thigh.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha flicked her tongue across Rio’s nipple. In response, Rio wrapped her hands in Agatha’s hair, holding her closer, focusing on the sensations from Agatha’s mouth and hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I missed you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nipped right above Rio’s right breast, causing her to gasp. Agatha felt the familiar sensation of want and need growing low in her belly. Agatha knew she would tease Rio for a little longer before she gave them what they both so desperately needed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was trying to find any possible friction she could and not getting what she needed. Rio removed Agatha’s top and pinched and rolled Agatha’s nipples, eliciting sounds of her own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha.” Rio grabbed a fistful of hair and pulled her head back to make eye contact. “Please,” she begged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha cupped the back of Rio’s head and kissed her slowly and passionately. Agatha tugged at the boyshorts. Rio broke the kiss and quickly shifted to remove them and took a moment to free Agatha of the rest of her clothing. Rio returned to her rightful place atop Agatha and resumed the kiss, grinding against her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha cupped Rio’s right buttcheek and ran her other hand up her inner thigh and along the crease of where it met her torso.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s breath caught, and she whimpered. “Agatha,” she pleaded again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What is it, baby?” Agatha asked innocently, her own need hidden by her clenched thighs, though she felt it throughout her entire body.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned in next to her ear. “Make love to me,” she purred before kissing Agatha under her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha moaned and slid a finger through Rio’s folds. Rio made a keening sound and pushed her back against the headboard, kissing her as though her lips were made of nectar.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha circled Rio’s clit and applied just enough pressure that Rio bucked and moaned into her mouth, continuing the cycle until Rio was panting into her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio kept clenching around nothing and dropped her mouth to Agatha’s shoulder, biting hard enough to leave a mark. “I need you, now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Impatient,” Agatha smirked, not changing positions, causing Rio to pout.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha brought her other hand up to cup the back of Rio’s head and twisted her hand, inserting two fingers into Rio and feeling the muscles constrict immediately.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That was fast,” she said before dropping a line of kisses down Rio’s neck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s reply was lost in a chain of satisfied sounds as she rocked her hips to meet Agatha’s rhythm as her fingers pumped into Rio. Agatha increased her speed and moved to kiss Rio, who slowed her bucking so that she could move to where she only straddled one of Agatha’s thighs. Before Agatha could ask why, Rio’s thumb was on her clit, rubbing slightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s hips rolled at the touch. “Not too strenuous,” Agatha warned against Rio’s mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Never.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio flipped her wrist around and slid two fingers into Agatha’s entrance. They brought their bodies together, legs entangled, and matched the other’s pace.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was sweet, it was slow, it was gentle. Third fingers were added, pressures were increased, and climaxes were reached. They held each other that way, chins resting on each other’s shoulders before finally detangling from each other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had her head on Agatha’s shoulder as they lay in bed, tracing shapes on the other’s skin and enjoying their post-coital bliss. Rio propped her head to look at the beautiful woman who loved her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How’s it feel to be fifty-two? Any different?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned to look at the last woman she would ever love, the woman that would be her future. “Yes, actually. I was so scared when I turned fifty-one. It’s how old Lorna was when she lost the fight. She left me a letter, of course. You’ll have to read them one day.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I do want to, but I think I’m still processing the ones I’ve read from Alice, so give me some time.” Rio interrupted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fair enough.” Agatha resumed her musings. “Like always, she knew just what to say. Told me to fix things with Lilia if I hadn’t yet, hoped I had found love, not to freak out over turning fifty-one, and that I had nothing to worry about. After her diagnosis, I made sure to take control of my health. Every screening and annual appointment, I do them all, and she knew it. She reminded me that every day is a step closer to death, whether I like it or not, and I have to choose what to do with that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She knew that I love my family very much, but she also told me to remember to prioritize my happiness, too. Not just theirs. It’s like she knew I would still be single. All-knowing, even in death.” Agatha ran her finger in random lines and squiggles on Rio’s upper arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you happy?” Rio focused on a freckle on Agatha’s chest, afraid of the answer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha placed the tip of her finger under Rio’s chin and tipped it up so their eyes met.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, my love. I am happier than I have been in a very long time. You play a large part in that.” Upon seeing the grin appear on Rio’s lips, Agatha decided now was the time to ask her question. “I have two questions for you. First, are you happy?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. “Very.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The next question is a bit bigger. I know we’ve talked about it, but didn’t make it official. Don’t look so panicked, will you move in with me? In June? After school is out?” Agatha was trying to sound confident, but her voice was shaking and this time, she was the one rubbing her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned in and kissed her, swiping her tongue over Agatha’s bottom lip, not quite deepening the kiss, but a promise of things to come. She pulled back, her eyes a promise of the future.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, Agatha. I would love to move in with you, and Nicky has basically catnapped Raven, so she’s good with it, too.” Rio laughed as she kissed Agatha again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed contentedly. “Good, I can’t wait.” She pulled her close and wrapped her arms around her. In a few more months, this would no longer just be her and Nicky’s home.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It would be Rio’s, too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was pretty sure anywhere Raven was, was her kingdom.

      The rest of the weekend went by quickly. They gathered at Alice and Jen’s house Saturday morning, and their six teens appeared, along with Vision, Herb, and Lilia. Furniture was moved, boxes unpacked, pictures and art hung. Alice and Jen’s house was officially theirs, and they were officially moved onto the compound. Everyone had turned to Rio, who informed them she’d be moving in in June.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tuesday was April Fool’s Day. Traditionally, Nicky’s favorite day, although he knew he couldn’t do anything too risky. This year, he asked Lilia’s permission for this particular prank, and after a sigh of defeat, she agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So on April first, all of the fountains at SHIELD turned into bubble fountains dyed in different colors of the rainbow flag, courtesy of Nicky and crew. Rio took pictures and sent them to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As for Rio, Alice had informed her that the fencing club was planning on wearing shirts to try and get under Rio’s skin. Another jab at who they saw as Agatha’s latest fling. Their shirts, according to Alice, were black with purple lettering that held the various “class years” to which each woman belonged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This time, there was no anger or emotional outbreak from Rio. Instead, she had Wanda help her make one of her own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her shirt was a light green with purple letters that read:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>

<span>
      On the back, Vidal was written across the top.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She could not wait to see the looks on those petty bitches’s faces later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took a picture and sent it to Agatha. She was finally taking ownership of her relationship with Agatha, and they were working on their communication and making it what they needed it to be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was something she had never had before and something she truly looked forward to doing.

      Part of Rio had been worried that Alice was playing her own April Fool’s Day prank. However, walking into the teacher’s lounge and seeing the looks on a few faces of women in their black Fencing Club shirts reassured Rio that her ride and/or die had indeed been telling her the truth. Alice had gone with her and made sure to immortalize the looks of absolute horror and disgust and sent them to the rest of the coven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was a good day with zero harmful pranks, and the students just thought their teachers were referencing an after-school Happy Hour. These kids were not phased by many things and at this crucial time of the year, they had bigger things to worry about than what manner of questionable things their teachers were doing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The shirt became one of Agatha’s favorites, judging by the way she greeted Rio at the door and ravaged her on the couch, unable to make it to the bedroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The school year always moved faster towards the end of the year with testing, ceremonies, performances, and all of the major projects due. With Agatha and Wanda so busy during the week, Rio felt like minutes flew by, but days slowed down. Football was in spring training, track was in full swing, and she found herself looking forward to the weekends more than usual or doing test prep with upperclassmen for college entrance exams. There were also AP tests and Dual Credit tests for those trying to get college credits.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had Coachella, the Beach Music Festival, the Prom, and the SHIELD end-of-the-year showcase to look forward to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While not all students at SHIELD were into fine arts, several still wanted to show off their talents and they prepared all year for this week. The last week of school was filled with showcase scrimmages, one-act plays, art displays, and recitals, with everyone showing off their skills. Their lives were packed for most of April and May, leading up to Memorial Day weekend at the beach house to kick off the summer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The powers that be for SHIELD had deemed the next two Fridays and Mondays ‘virtual instruction’ days since a large portion of students would be either attending one of the two weekends of Coachella or going with their parents to the area but not to the festival itself, much like they did for days after award ceremonies. Most students had already completed the work as teachers had released it early, and Rio had already graded everything that had been turned in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio closed the door to her classroom at the end of the day Thursday and turned to leave, running into Lilia instead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Where did you even come from?” Rio put a hand to her chest in surprise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Depends on who you ask, my office, New York,” she leaned her head to the side, “hell.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The side of Rio’s mouth ticked up, and she had a feeling of who had said the last one.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lorna or Agatha?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Neither.” Something dark flickered across Lilia’s face before her normal cheerful expression returned. “I wanted to ask if you planned on returning next year and if you would want to accept the head basketball coaching position officially. While Peggy is staying, she is resigning from coaching. It comes with a small pay bump.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why wouldn’t I stay?” Rio asked, taken aback by the question.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “To travel with Agatha and be able to spend more time with her,” Lilia answered as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio mulled it over. It was something Agatha had been worried about, the traveling and distance taking a toll. They had handled it well so far, and this summer would be a much further and longer time apart. However, they were working on their communication skills and building a very strong and solid relationship. Even when apart, there were ways to remain connected in all aspects, and they trusted each other. Why would she give up her career? Agatha would support her if Rio wanted to, but Rio wasn’t that person.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m staying, and I’d love to take the position officially.” Rio finally said firmly. “Walk with me.” She instructed Lilia. The rest of the coven and the confidence they exuded was wearing off on her, and Lilia followed. “I know it’s going to be difficult, Lilia, but what relationship isn’t? I’m done bolting every time things get hard. I can visit if and when I can when she’s gone for months at a time. I love her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They exited the building and walked toward Rio’s car. She and Alice hadn’t carpooled, as Rio had been at her apartment and not at the compound. She put her backpack in the passenger seat and turned to look questioningly at Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why? What concerns do you have? I’m still trying to separate the evil ex and the caring aunt, and while part of me screams ‘choke a bitch,’ I see you here, and you genuinely care for her. You want her to be happy, and I truly believe you want us to work. I see how she looks at you now, and she adores you. It’s so confusing.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia looked down and crossed her arms, letting the unprofessional admission slide. It was after hours.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know it is, and your feelings are completely valid. I always thought she needed someone who could travel with her. However, with technology the way it is, she just needs that connection. I have no hard feelings or ill will, no jealousy. Agatha and I  agree that we’re better off with our original dynamic, and somewhere, things went off course for too long. We learned from our mistakes, and we grew from them. It made us who we are today, for better or worse. I do want what’s best for everyone, Rio.” Lilia looked up, locking eyes with Rio. “That includes you, and you can come to me anytime, about anything, when you feel comfortable.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll keep that in mind, Lilia. Thank you. I mean that. I know you’ve been protecting me all year, for Agatha’s sake, and I appreciate it.” Rio did mean it, but she was no longer shying away from certain petty women. “I think I have control now, though. I’ll let you know If I need backup.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia gave her a genuine smile, “Oh, I know you will. You did well last week. It wasn’t all for Agatha, though.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyebrows formed a question mark. Lilia shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did I ever tell you that Lorna and I grew up together in New York? The City, specifically? Our parents were friends, and I, like you, spent a lot of time in Norma Wu’s house. My parents were Italian. Very stereotypical Bronx Italian, the way movies depict us. Very connected, I kept some of those connections. Norma was more concerned about you than you’ll ever know. Called me a few times about you and your situation with your parents.” Lilia glanced at her smartwatch. “Well, look at the time. I need to get to Palm Springs to pick up Sharon. I’m sure I’ll see you at the festival.” She gave Rio a quick hug and hurried off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched her go. What the hell had she meant about Norma?
     </span>

<span>
      They had made it to the extremely exclusive club resort near the Coachella grounds late that night. Agatha tried not to fly short distances, especially if they were in-state, so the whole crew drove southeast. They had an entire wing for their clan and security detail. Rio lay in their bed in her Bulbasaur boxers and a green tank top, thinking about Lilia’s childhood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned her head as she caught sight of Agatha walking in from the bathroom in one of Rio’s Phoenix Mercury shirts and purple hipsters that she knew had Naughty written across the back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hi, gorgeous.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio reached toward Agatha and motioned for her to join her in the bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pulled back the covers and joined Rio, lying on her side to face her, kissing her slowly, and drinking her in. Agatha slipped one hand between Rio’s pillow and her cheek, tracing her jawline with her thumb. The other arm she draped over Rio and pulled her closer to Agatha, sliding her knee in between Rio’s. Rio’s arms mirrored hers, and they lay there, entangled and kissing, until one of them decided they needed more air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tilted her head back slightly and sighed contently, her eyes half closed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why do long drives make us so tired?” She asked rhetorically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The scientist in Rio could not resist. “Our bodies are technically at rest. However, they are being hurtled at unnatural speeds, which can raise our adrenaline levels, and then they drop quickly. There’s also poor air quality and overstimulation from constant input, which leads to mental exhaustion and possible dehydration since you’re generally not drinking as much. That depends on how long the drive is, though. Also, the vibrations from the car can just give you that rocking-a-baby-to-sleep reaction, and then sitting too long has its effects on the body.” Rio was deep in teacher mode, and it was very cute.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank you, Ms. Vidal, that was very informative. It was a rhetorical question, but you’re so cute when you get all educational.” Agatha leaned forward and kissed her again quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled into it. She had told Agatha about some of the discussion she had had with Lilia that afternoon and had questions, that, like always, gnawed at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha,” she started. “Is Lilia in the mafia?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha clicked her tongue. Well, this wasn’t going to go in the direction she somewhat hoped it would go, though she was absolutely exhausted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We do not break the spaghetti, and we do not talk about the mafia.” Was the answer Agatha gave Rio. However, Agatha was confused by the random question. “Why?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chewed on the inside of her lip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lilia told me today that she grew up in the type of New York Italian family that movies portrayed. And all I can see now is the Godfather in my head. That Lilia’s family was connected and she kept some of those connections. Then, she said that Norma talked to her a few times about my home situation with my biological mother and her husband. I did a little bit of research. It’s not Little Italy in Manhattan, like where we visited. She’s from the original and old-school families from up on Arthur Avenue ” Rio locked eyes with Agatha again before she could reply. “Remember, no more lies, half-truths, or omissions.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Shit.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She would just spin it differently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She came from that type of family, yes, but Lilia distanced herself, with permission, that is. She still has the connections if she needs them, and yes, Norma called her a few times before our blow-up. I don’t know about after.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded—some secrets Rio would have to accept.

      Coachella weekend was an absolute blast for everyone and packed with new memories. Wanda and Nat were excited to be completely open at a concert and acted like teenagers. They recreated their Lilith Fair days to the Missy Elliot set, and even though they were in the VIP section, pictures were taken and put on the internet, some of them by their own family and friends.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen Kale-Wu, as she and Alice had officially decided to hyphenate their names, was working overtime. There was not an image clause in either star’s contract, but she knew the studios would frown on this. Specifically Wanda. It didn’t matter what year it was or that the president of the United States was a black married lesbian woman with two kids. Some people were still awful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice Wu-Kale took her wife’s phone away from her for the rest of the weekend and probably saved her life by preventing her from having a heart attack.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha loved seeing her other friends and those who were performing, but as always, she enjoyed taking in the scene around her and living in the moment. She and Tony were both equipped with spray bottles for when Nicky and Morgan made out a little
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       too
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      long, though they were quickly confiscated by Pepper and Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky complained that Billy and Eddie didn’t get sprayed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They can’t get pregnant,” Tony and Agatha deadpanned at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan rolled her eyes and said they were definitely not doing that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky muttered something about how, if they were, they would be smart about it and how he had gotten the talk way earlier than most.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen took the squirt bottle from Rio and shot Wanda in the face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey! I can’t get pregnant!” Wanda wiped the water off her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, but you’re going to be the death of me if you don’t calm down,” Jen warned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha loved her growing group of found family.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her eyes scanned the area to see Lilia with Sharon. They were only a few years apart in age, and she made a mental note to find out the official story there. Sharon was singing along, and Lilia had a look on her face that Agatha had never seen before. It wasn’t the one Lilia wore when she told Agatha she loved her or even at the end when they had agreed to get married.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, Lilia looked at Sharon like she was the only person that existed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha flinched, expecting that age-old hurt to reappear, to feel something in her carefully sewn-together heart rip back open, but it didn’t. If anything, it strengthened the seam.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was happy for Lilia, and she suddenly understood why Lilia had meddled. To see Agatha look like that. Happy and in love, to truly bring out the best version of herself. Not that she needed to be in love, but Agatha knew she hadn’t been completely happy, and Lilia hadn’t been either, without her family. Agatha had gone soft, and she didn’t completely hate it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Pocket-lint for your thoughts.” Wanda had come up beside her and was speaking right into her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The expression is ‘penny’. You know that.” Agatha looked at her out of the side of her eye.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A penny is too pricy for your gutter thoughts, Harkness.” Wanda quipped with a grin, bumping their shoulders together. Agatha bumped her back and nodded in Lilia and Sharon’s direction. They were now leaning into each other for a slower song.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Look at them, look at Lilia.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda watched the two women for a moment, her face lighting up. “Aww, so cute.” She pulled out her phone and opened an app, typing something.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed. “You have an app, don’t you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have an app.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What do you do with all your romantic betting pool winnings?” Agatha knew Wanda did these things just for fun. They all did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Donate it usually.” Wanda shrugged. “Although, I think we should look into starting our own foundation, in Lorna’s name.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her, searching for what to say.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, you know one of us would have thought of it eventually,” Wanda added upon seeing Agatha’s shock.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m more shocked that you want to use illegally gotten gains for charity.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s smile widened. “You know she’d be proud.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed. “You know, you’re not wrong.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Somewhere, Lorna was very proud of the girls she raised.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of the music festival weekend continued in much the same way. Agatha sang several songs to Rio, including “Beautiful Things,” Tony made faces, and Pepper smacked him on the shoulder, asking why he didn’t do sweet things like that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sunday night, after Coachella came to an end, Agatha, Rio, Wanda, Nat, Tony, and Pepper sat around a fire pit outside of the resort. The resort was hosting only celebrities and their entourages that weekend, and Agatha had been able to see several of her friends throughout the three days.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio decided it was the best time to ask exactly what their beef was with each other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What’s the deal between you two?” Rio asked, looking between Tony and Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He’s difficult.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s difficult.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They answered at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The other women just looked at each other. No one truly knew what started it. Agatha had been a child star, and Tony had grown up in the world of film, following his father around, learning all there was to know. At first, Howard tried to put Tony in front of the camera, but that wasn’t Tony’s calling. He did better at directing. Pepper had been an assistant, and that’s how they met. Agatha had done several Howard Stark films, and she and Tony had strong personalities that matched each other. That had been the beginning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He’s bossy,” Agatha offered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s very hard-headed and stubborn,” he shot back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He’s a nepo baby, and throws tantrums,” she countered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They’re both children,” Pepper interjected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They used to just bicker and fight like that, but then something else happened when Howard turned everything over to Tony.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyes went dark. “He knows what he did.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony’s eyes went wide. “I don’t! You got incredibly pissed at me and went from your particular brand of slightly toxic bantering to a complete bitch to work with Agatha. We’ve gotten to where we can playfully banter, and our kids can date, but I still don’t know what I did wrong.” Tony looked at Pepper, hoping she knew, but the look on her face said she didn’t.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Let me refresh your mind. You were about to take over all of Howard’s projects and he was trying to make it easy for you. Wanda was in a few of those projects.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha saw Wanda tense, and Nat took her hand. They knew what was coming.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “When all of a sudden pictures of her and Nat making out at a concert were everywhere, and they were outed, studios started getting backlash, and no one liked their straight golden goose having a preference toward girls, which I still do not understand since I haven’t had a huge problem. Word in the back alleys was that it was your doing. You were the one to take and leak the pictures so that you didn’t have a problem taking the keys to Daddy’s kingdom.” Her voice was caustic as the accusation left her lips. Rio stepped back, shocked that her innocent question had opened up such a volatile confession.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You what?” Wanda yelled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They will never find your body. TWENTY YEARS!” Nat said darkly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’re getting a divorce. How could you!” Pepper spat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’re keeping Morgan in the divorce.” Rio put her hand to her chest, appalled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony looked at all five women.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I would deserve all of that if I had done it. But I didn’t. Dad wanted me to, but I refused. Dad wouldn’t ‘allow me’ to marry Pepper because she wasn’t famous, and it caused us a lot of lost time and pain. Do you think I was going to do that to Wanda? Someone I considered a friend? No. Was it my dad? Yes. I had nothing to do with it. That’s when I tried to set out on my own, but his heart got him a few weeks later.” Everyone lowered their hackles, considering Tony’s confession. “The damage had unfortunately been done by then, and I couldn’t undo it. I apologize for that, but it wasn't me. Not even my photos.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was still for a moment before turning to Tony. “Thank you for being honest and not being that person.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re welcome.” Tony raised a glass of water in salute.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, you’re still annoying,” Agatha attempted to double down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So are you.” Tony agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I guess I’m glad I didn’t kill you. Your kid does make mine happy.” Agatha admitted reluctantly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Your kid isn’t so bad. Thanks for not murdering me. You would have gotten away with it and taken my wife.” Tony mused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She would have.” Pepper winked at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat was laughing. “Growing up in this industry absolutely fucked you guys up. And coming from me, that says a lot.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It did.” Tony, Agatha, and Wanda said simultaneously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “In all seriousness though, no. I wanted things to work out for you two, and I’m glad it finally has. Vision’s a great guy, but come on, if I really wanted to out Wanda, I would have taken pictures at one of the many house parties we were at. Besides, you forget. I am a SHIELD alumnus, too, and Lilia would have murdered me. I knew how close she was to Lorna and you two. I’m not that stupid.” He finished his water and stood. “With that, I am going to bed. Are you coming, honey?” He looked at Pepper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll be right there.” She watched him leave, and she turned back to the others.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am so happy for all of you. Howard was an elitist asshole and would do whatever it took to make sure nothing affected the bottom line, even if it meant hurting others. He absolutely hated me, we even had to wait until he died to get married. Anyway, Agatha, speaking of losing time, prom is the second weekend of May, and Nicky hasn’t asked Morgan yet. She’s expecting a Promposal.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s eyes lit up. The prom was only for juniors and seniors, but she had been looking forward to it. “I need to help. This is what I was made for.” Her grip was tight on Nat’s forearm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What the fuck is a promposal?” Nat asked, loosening Wanda’s grip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s like a proposal, but for prom. It’s an elaborate way to ask someone to prom, cheesy but cute.” Rio explained. She was also excited.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was not as excited. This meant acknowledging that her baby boy was getting older. She knew it was happening, but moments like this reinforced it, and she didn’t like it. Agatha blew out a breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What does Morgan absolutely hate, and what might she like?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Returning to school that week included preparing for testing. Most upperclassmen would be testing the following week and tensions were rising. Rio wasn’t worried about the students that she taught. She knew they’d be fine. Her personal juniors, Nicky and Morgan, as she considered Morgan hers by extension now, had several exams they were taking, and she knew they would ace them all. They both studied hard, and with their parents, they learned quickly and were pre-disposed to do well academically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      All grades still had testing in May, even in private schools, although the tests were different from state testing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before all of that started, Nicky had a question to ask Morgan.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He thought about doing it at school but knew she preferred a more private moment this year. She had said she wanted everything their senior year to be big, so this year, he was going small. Though their moms had insisted it be captured on camera. Which was why they were on the basketball court at her house with Pepper filming from a window and Rio taking pictures from behind one of the garages. Morgan was in the zone, though, and didn’t even notice. While Nicky was the taller of the two, Morgan was still the more skillful and was beating him in their one-on-one game. Height did not mean better. He had fouled her, and she moved to the free-throw line. He switched the basketballs out and passed the new one to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Let’s make this one count.” Nicky dropped his eyes to the ball.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan followed his eyes down to the ball where ‘Prom?’ was written in gold paint pen. She looked up at him, just knowing that Nicholas Harkness, son of Agatha, had something to say.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was wearing a SHIELD football shirt and, with all the confidence that only a high school football star could possess, looked at her and asked, as smoothly as he could, “Will you make me the luckiest quarterback and be my MVP at prom?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan couldn’t control her laughter. She clutched the ball and doubled over from laughing so hard.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky put his hands on his hips and looked very unamused, except her laugh was contagious, and he started laughing, too. She sat down on the court, trying to catch her breath, her legs bent at the knees, elbows propped on them, with the basketball in between her feet. Nicky walked over and sat next to her, mirroring her position and facing her, his laughter dying down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Was it that bad?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She nodded, wiping tears from her eyes. “Nicky, we’ve known each other since we were four. The ball was more than enough, this was our moms, all of them, and I know it.” She waved to Rio, who had come out of hiding. “To be clear, I didn’t expect anything more than ‘hey, prom?’ My mother wanted something. You’ve gotta go really big next year, though, Harkness.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky looked at her with the wide eyes of teenage love. “You’re not going to break up with me before then?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you plan on doing something stupid?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Plan on it? No. It might be in my DNA, though.” He was, after all, a Harkness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mine too. Dad has a history, just like Agatha does. I love you, Nicky. We always said, even as kids, that we would go to senior prom together.” She looked at him with questioning eyes, knowing there was more there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I just know that high school sweethearts don’t always stay together. We may go to different colleges, you might find someone way better, you never forget your first love, but that doesn’t mean we’re each other’s last love.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky and Morgan had discussed the possibilities of their futures, especially when the first few recruitment letters had come in. They were realistic kids, and while they did not plan on breaking up, they knew the possibility existed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan put her hand on her cheek and saw the mixture of hope and sadness in his eyes. An emotion that Nicholas Harkness, son of Agatha, rarely ever had. Her own eyes were glassy, and tears threatened at the edges.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So how about this, even if we break up, which would shatter me.” She cleared the lump from her throat and continued her thought. “And as long as we aren’t dating anyone else, we will still go to prom together.” She stuck her pinky out like they had so many times growing up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Absolutely, but we’ll still be together, getting ready to go to college, whatever that looks like.” He hooked his pinky with hers, and they sealed their pact with a kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, is that a yes?” He tilted his head to the side like a puppy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan wiped a tear aside with a finger. “Yes, you goofball.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He hopped to his feet and offered her his hand. “Great, I got you something.” He rushed over to his gym bag and pulled out two stuffed penguins. One wore a football jersey with Harkness on the back and the number 12, Nicky’s number. He handed it to Morgan and kept the other, who wore a basketball jersey with Stark on the back and Morgan’s number, 13, on it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan smiled, huffing a laugh, and looked up at him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You grew up surrounded by women.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pepper had come outside and now stood by Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What happened? I saw them get a little sad there.” Pepper was concerned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had heard some of the conversation and repeated it to Pepper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pepper swore. “They’re growing up and realizing that life isn’t perfect.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “One of the hardest lessons to learn is that life doesn’t go the way we hope, no matter how much we want it to.” Rio agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ⭐⭐⭐
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It had been a long two weeks of testing, and Agatha had been busy with wrapping filming for the TV show, as well as table reads and fittings for her other projects. Rio finally had her back for the weekend and the house to themselves. They hadn’t had much time over the past few weeks to connect, and they needed that time very much.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had always loved to be the dominant one in bed and preferred to top until Agatha came along. Rio would occasionally take control, and there were times when Agatha needed her to, but now was not one of those times.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio lay on what would soon be their bed in their bedroom. Her arms were tied together above her head so Agatha could still turn her over if she wanted to. Her ankles were free, and a silk blindfold was secure over her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay baby, traffic light system, and the safeword is kittens,” Agatha whispered in her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, unconsciously biting her lower lip and rubbing her thighs together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed. “I haven’t even started, and my sweet girl is already needy.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha ran a hand up Rio’s thigh, Rio separating her legs for her. Agatha cupped her before pulling her hand back and giving her cunt a firm smack.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio made a delighted sound. They had been adding spicier elements to their sex life, and impact play was one of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s from when you were teasing me earlier,” Rio defended herself, knowing she didn’t need to, but she liked being vocal.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is my sweet girl being impatient?” Agatha gave Rio another firm smack, earning another pleasurable sound.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s hard to be patient when I know what you can do.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was already wearing her harness, complete with their newest toy that technically didn’t need a harness, but the reinforcement never hurt. It was a purple vibrating double-ended dildo that would also provide clitoral stimulation to Agatha as the wearer. The shaft had seven inches of insertable length and was three fingers in girth. It was going to be a full night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you now?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha asked as she hovered above Rio on all fours and kissed her heatedly. Agatha took the tip of the strap and ran it down Rio’s slit, causing her to gasp and thrust her hips forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nuh-uh,” Agatha said, tapping Rio’s nose with the tip of her index finger. “Not yet,”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio whined, yanking at her restraints.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned down and kissed Rio, knowing the strap was pushing against her, teasing. Every time it pushed against Rio, Agatha felt it and moaned, clenching around the large bulb resting against her G-spot. She so badly wanted to be ramming into Rio right now but knew she had to be patient, too. Agatha swirled her tongue around Rio’s and ran her hands up and down her body while Rio fruitlessly rutted against Agatha in an attempt to get some friction. All it did was make her wetter and more frustrated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It did, however, cause Agatha to thrust forward, moaning from stimulation against her clit and inside of her. If Agatha didn’t move back from Rio, she would come like this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She groaned at the mixed feeling as Agatha pulled back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is my sweet girl frustrated? Trying to make me come so I’ll hurry?” Agatha cocked her head to the side, caressing Rio’s cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio whimpered. “Baby, please.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tsked. “Soon, turn over for me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With Agatha’s help, Rio rolled onto her belly, still unable to see.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha dragged her nails down Rio’s back as she hissed. Agatha gave Rio’s left ass cheek a firm slap and then kissed it before doing the same thing to the other. Rio writhed against the sheets for any relief. Agatha finally slid a hand towards Rio’s pussy from behind and lightly ghosted over her clit, causing Rio to gasp.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is that what you need, baby?” Agatha asked, leaning over her back and whispering next to her ear, causing the toy to nudge against her entrance, and hit Agatha just right.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha used two fingers to draw circles, roll, and flick across Rio’s clit in a pattern she knew would get her close, quickly. Rio had raised her hips off the bed and felt the dam inside her threatening to burst, “Aga…” She started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s hand was gone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Baby!” Rio dropped flat onto her stomach.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You didn’t ask nicely, and you don’t have permission yet,” Agatha purred in her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please, baby?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll think about it,” Agatha ghosted her fingers over Rio again and then circled just one at her entrance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio released an uncontrollable low moan when Agatha pushed three fingers in and started thrusting. Rio swore at being filled so suddenly, meeting her pace and pushing her hips back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha alternated sides of Rio’s ass to occasionally spank her, just hard enough to leave a faint mark, and paid close attention to the woman beneath her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was close, and she needed to come.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Baby, Agatha, please, please, let me come,” Rio babbled between grunts, groans, and gasps.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha considered it. Rio was getting there, but not quite where she wanted her. She slowed her motions and removed her hand slowly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Almost baby, roll back over for me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled onto her back, and Agatha took in her beauty. Rio was an absolute mess, her hair was wild, light bruises and marks across her chest from Agatha marking her earlier, and her pussy was wet and dripping.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned down to kiss her, biting Rio’s lower lip. “You’re stunning.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’d say something back, but I’m blindfolded.” Rio quipped.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked. “I should punish you for that, brat.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’d like it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed her again before moving between Rio’s legs and settling. The strap was growing uncomfortable, and she needed to use it soon. The pressure inside her was building, and she knew she was close.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Just a little longer.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha licked a long line up Rio and swirled around her clit, before dragging her tongue backward. The sounds from Rio were sinful and almost sent Agatha over the edge herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She reinserted her three fingers from before and curled them forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, Agatha, there, please.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thrust her hips as her muscles clenched, and Agatha knew Rio was extremely close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stopped and carefully pulled out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio screamed from frustration at the edging, even though she had consented to it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha reached up and took the blindfold off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know. You hate me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded tears of frustration in her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stroked the purple cock, and Rio looked at it hungrily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you ready?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned back and moved closer to Rio, guiding the tip and watching it slide in easily, enjoying the small gasp that Rio emitted upon being filled. Agatha focused on Rio’s face as she moaned and pulled against her restraints.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wrapped her legs around Agatha’s waist and began to grind against her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grabbed the remote next to her that controlled the vibrations and set it on medium. She gripped Rio’s waist and began to thrust.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had been so close, Agatha knew she was holding back, and with all the movement and Rio’s reactions, she wasn’t far. She reached up and tugged on the ties to undo Rio’s restraints and turned up the speed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Be my good girl and come for me, Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s thrusts were hard, each one applying more pressure to the vibrations on her clit when Rio slammed her pelvis as close to Agatha’s as possible and let out a guttural cry of pleasure along with a string of words and what Agatha thought was her name.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha followed closely behind as the action provided the pressure she needed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They collapsed, and Agatha turned the device off, letting them rest for a moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She rolled them over and looked up at Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Color?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Green as emeralds.” Rio looked down at Agatha, a mischievous smile appearing. Rio leaned back, causing the toy to shift. She placed her hands flat on Agatha’s stomach and began to ride her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gripped Rio’s hips, allowing her to lean back and brace her hands on her ankles. Agatha groped for the remote, turning the vibrations back on. She arched her back as the stimulation reminded her how sensitive she was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sped up, and Agatha compensated, biting her lip while she watched Rio riding the purple cock. From this angle, she could watch as it entered and stretched her each time. Agatha bit her lip as Rio shuddered, and fluid escaped around the purple appendage, though Rio kept going.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was on the edge.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She ran a hand from Rio’s side and thumbed her clit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Jesus, fuck, right there.” Rio increased the speed of her thrusts as Agatha arched her back and turned the vibrations on high.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, I’m…” Agatha wrapped a leg around Rio and used her free arm to pull her close. Agatha’s body trembled as they rode out the storm and she shattered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio followed closely behind her, and it was Rio who scrambled for the remote and turned off the overstimulating vibrations.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They lay like that for a few moments before it became too uncomfortable.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They slowly removed the toy from both of them and set it aside to clean. Rio had rolled onto her side, and Agatha handed Rio her water cup and helped her drink. After she set it back down, she noticed that Rio was staring at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re going to make me get up and pee, and then you’re going to help me clean up and be all sweet, aren’t you?” Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I hear that’s what you do when you care about someone, yes,” Agatha replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I hope you know you’re stuck with me.” Rio smiled, moving to get out of the bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m counting on it. Wanda started a betting pool on when I’ll propose. She won’t let me play. Something about it being unfair.” Agatha walked around to Rio’s side of the bed in case she was unsteady on her feet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We haven’t even talked about marriage,” Rio said shakily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Which is why it goes out five years.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What does she not bet on?” Rio scoffed, trying not to think of herself marrying Agatha, though she very much wanted to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Herself, politics, the weather, and the NFL, everything else, including her children, are fair game.” Agatha walked next to Rio in the bathroom and found the wipes. Rio went to the restroom first.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed. “I love this family.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good, now help me change the sheets. There’s a puddle in the middle of the bed.”

      Rio was happy with how their life was settling. She had begun to pack up the apartment, and Raven could sense a change on the horizon. They had moved enough times that as long as she was with her human, she was fine. This time, they were just moving to her other house. The time-weathered cat had molded herself to fit inside a box and watched as Rio packed a bag for the music festival on the beach that weekend. So much had happened since she bought those tickets for Agatha in February.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re staying with Nicky this weekend. We’re trusting him at the house by himself. Did I just say we? It’s okay, I said we. We’ve been a family for a while, though. Agatha has said she’s fine with this. It’s absolutely fine. It will be Nicky and the boys on the compound. Jen and Alice will be there, too, but they won’t be around much. They’re going to meet a few potential doggy cousins for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was walking between her closet and the suitcase and over to the dresser. Raven’s eyes followed her, inserting meows where appropriate. She hissed when dogs were mentioned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, you’ll be just fine.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put clothes in the suitcase that sat on the bed. It was Thursday evening, and they planned to drive up to the beach house in the morning. The festival wasn’t far from the house, and they preferred to stay in a familiar space. Rio smiled as she thought of the large house overlooking the water. It was there that she and Agatha had decided to be friends, despite every fiber of her being wanting to push Agatha down in the sand and kiss the smirk off her face that very first night at the party.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even if someone had told Rio what they would go through between then and now, she would do it all again to end up here, surrounded by boxes, madly in love with Agatha Harkness, who loved her back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Life is weird.” She said to Raven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Talking to the wise one again?” Agatha asked, having come in undetected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave her a warm smile as Agatha walked over and gave her a quick hug and kiss on the cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “One of these days, I’m going to think you’re an intruder.” Rio turned her head and kissed Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’d let you. It could be fun.” Agatha winked.  She looked down at Rio’s full suitcase. “Love, you do not need this much clothing. It’s just us. You could walk around in just a swimsuit, underwear, or naked. I like the last option the best.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you ever not horny? Don’t answer that. I’ve met your stuffed moose.” Rio rolled her eyes as she headed to the bathroom to gather more things.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s the menopause and my extremely sexy girlfriend.” Agatha sat on the edge of the bed. “Wanda and Nat are safely in Tahoe. Vision and Herb are on call for the boys, and Jen is grumbling about being on a compound with teenagers for the weekend.” She reported.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio walked back into the room laughing. She tossed her toiletries into the bag and zipped up the suitcase.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’ll live. They’re good kids. The one time they threw a party, it was the most responsible teen party in the history of house parties. If they do anything, it will be staying up all night to watch movies and play video games.” She took the handle of the suitcase and gestured toward Raven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Get your stepcat, please, and let's go.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It didn’t take long for Rio to decide that all festivals should be held near one of Agatha’s homes. Or that they should go house shopping near other festivals. It would also give them solid vacation options. Rio lightly scolded herself. They were moving in together in a month. It was too soon to purchase real estate together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Wasn’t it?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was late Friday night, and they were lying in bed as Rio’s thoughts wandered. The first night of the festival was also playing in her head. Singing along to Train and Lenny Kravitz were the highlights.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled over and pulled Rio closer to her. “Do you remember Labor Day weekend?” She asked sleepily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You mean the weekend you climbed into the bed with me, and I almost died? No, not at all.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Smartass.”Agatha placed her head on Rio’s shoulder. “I knew I wanted you as more than just a friend, and I couldn’t admit it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Really? Could have convinced me.” Rio said sarcastically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha scoffed, “The only people we slightly convinced were ourselves.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Aggie, we didn’t convince ourselves. We gaslit ourselves.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up at her, her bright eyes cloudy with sleep. “I’m glad we’re here now. I love you forever.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tucked a piece of Agatha’s unruly hair behind her ear. “I love you, too. Forever. Even though forever isn’t technically classifiable.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nerd.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of the weekend went by smoothly, with Agatha and Rio enjoying each other and listening to great music. They watched the sunsets paint the sky in the background and saw many of Agatha’s friends who were becoming more than just acquaintances to Rio.   This was becoming Rio’s world, too, and she was becoming recognizable even without being on Agatha’s arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys back home were doing well and had not thrown any parties, according to the couple that had stayed on the compound.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      On Sunday night, it was finally time for Alanis to perform. It was Agatha’s favorite set of the entire weekend, and she sang each song as though she personally had written the lyrics. In some cases, she had helped. Agatha and Alanis had connected before the set, and they exchanged many knowing looks during the performance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn’t jealous at all, she kept telling herself, though she did make sure she was glued to Agatha’s side.

<p>
<span>
      Prom was a few days away, and while Nicky was looking forward to it, Morgan’s birthday was the following Tuesday, and he had no idea what to get her. He’d been getting Morgan something every year since they had turned five, but it was always the latest toy, a gift card, a trending item or gadget, something you would get a friend. This year, he wanted to do something meaningful but was unsure of what. He didn’t want to do jewelry. No, they weren’t there yet. He had already given her the promposal stuffed toy penguins. He knew it needed to be something personal, and he knew just the woman to talk to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was sixth period and Rio’s planning time. Nicky easily obtained permission to speak with Ms. Vidal during sixth period, and he took all of his things and left, Morgan watching him suspiciously as he walked out of Mrs. Wu-Kale’s AP History class.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky stuck his head in the open door, looking for the woman whose advice he was seeking, spotting her at her desk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, Ms. Vidal, can I talk to you for a moment?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked up and smiled at the teenage boy with his mop of chestnut curls that reminded her of his mother’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course, honey,” the endearment slipping out. “Are you hungry? I have snacks.” Rio always kept snacks for herself and used them as random incentives or when a kid needed a boost during the day.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, I’m good, thanks.” He placed a stool on the other side of her desk and sat down. “I need some help with something, and I think you’d be a good person to ask.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stopped what she was doing and looked up at him. He looked nervous and was fidgeting in his seat. Nicky was usually confident, like Agatha, and took command in most situations. Also, like Agatha, he didn’t often ask for help.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicholas, what’s wrong?” Rio’s worry emerged and she questioned if she needed to text for reinforcements.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nothing’s wrong, no. Morgan’s birthday is next Tuesday, and I’m clueless. I want to get something that says I love you, but teenage appropriate.” He tapped his foot on the rung of the stool nervously. Rio breathed a sigh of relief.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh! Well, I do know Morgan well, being her coach, but Nicky, you’ve known her most of your life. This isn’t the first birthday or Christmas you’ve exchanged gifts. What have you gotten her so far in your relationship?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn’t sure why Nicky had chosen her, of all people to ask for advice on this. She had difficulty coming up with gifts for Agatha, and it took her some serious contemplation to finally land on the right one. She had never done well in relationships as a teen and young adult, and kids didn’t make mix tapes and CDs anymore. If anything, Wanda or Nat would be great people to ask.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky blew out a breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Umm, Christmas, I got her a gift card for a sports store, and for Valentine’s Day, it was flowers, chocolate, and a giant bear.” He grimaced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio suppressed a smile, even though her eyes brightened. “Oh, Nicholas. I can see now why you’re asking for advice,” She gave him a playful smile and saw him relax. “You don’t always have to give her something tangible. Your mother and I have exchanged material items, yes, but we have also given each other experiences and memories, like concerts and trips.” She clarified upon seeing the scandalized look on his face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky seemed to think it over for a moment before looking back at her, still thinking, “Okay, well, we’re still teenagers, so there’s only so much we can do, and I have to get Pepper and Mr. Stark’s permission to take her anywhere, and your’s and Mom’s of course.” He added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt as though her heart did somersaults when Nicky said he needed both of their permission to do something. While they acknowledged that she was somewhat of a parental figure, she did not have that authority. This would need to be discussed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It depends on what and where it is,” Rio said cautiously. “What does she like?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sports, music, surfing, we like a lot of the same things.” Nicky shrugged, trying to think of something they didn’t do a lot or hadn’t done before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew this needed to be his idea, and didn’t want to just supply the answer for him, but she had an idea.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The WNBA season is starting very soon, maybe look that up.” Rio knew it was starting the Friday after Morgan’s birthday, but she wasn’t telling him that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It does? Does LA have a team?” Nicky asked innocently. He followed college basketball and was getting more into the professional leagues. Morgan had mentioned to Rio that she wanted Nicky to watch more of the women’s league with her this year.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Nicky and shrugged, silently telling him to do this part himself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky understood her nonverbal cues and pulled his phone out of his pocket, tapping the screen quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I found it! I wonder if I can get courtside seats and take her.” Nicky’s eyes lit up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You should give Pepper a call. She’ll talk to Tony, and then we can all talk about it tonight.” Rio thought for a moment. She still wasn’t sure why he had asked her. She looked at the clock, noting they still had a few minutes and everything was ready for her next class. “Hey, why ask me? Surely your mom is way better versed in this type of thing.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky gave her a soft smile as he stood. “Several reasons. You know Morgan and the two of you have some things in common. I know you’re going to be direct with me. Mom would tell me to ask my aunts or you, Aunt Wanda would go with something sappy, and Aunt Nat would go with either a weapon or defer to Aunt Wanda. One year, I did give Morgan a personalized pocket knife. She still has it. Mr. Stark makes her carry it on our dates,” he laughed. “The main reason, though, is you’re my other mom, Rio. Why wouldn’t I ask you?” With that, the bell rang, and he waved and disappeared, leaving her to process that and teach simultaneously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Kids.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pepper agreed to the game, and Tony knew the team's owner, making it easier for Nicky to get tickets. All he needed to do was ask Agatha that night. Rio was also there as they discussed it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s the first game of the season. We’ll be there too.” Rio was saying to Agatha. She knew Agatha didn’t have a problem with it and was just making Nicky sweat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We will?” Agatha threw a look at her girlfriend, who was sitting on the couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, I’ll be there. I’ll take Alice if you don’t want to go.” Rio continued to grade papers, unbothered by the other woman’s question.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, I’ll go.” She turned back to Nicky, who sat, alert, on another couch. “Okay, you can go. Just be very alert sitting courtside, and be a gentleman. It’s a late game, so you’ll have to go with us or a driver.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky frowned. It was the first time Rio had ever seen Nicky upset with a condition that Agatha had set. He looked over at Rio with a hopeful look on his face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I agree. I know your mom has let you drive at night by yourself before, but this is different. It’s late, in a busy area, after a large event, in traffic. Not only is it against the terms of your license, it’s just not safe yet, Nicky. You’ll both be tired, and this way, you can talk or anything else.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had wanted to interject before Rio had responded but was impressed with Rio’s response. Nicky huffed, knowing if he didn’t accept the terms, it wouldn’t happen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay,” he grumbled before adjusting his attitude when he saw the warning looks from each of them. “I’m going upstairs to get all that sorted out like the responsible and respectful young man I am. Thank you for the idea, Ri.” He turned on his heel and retreated upstairs before either mom could change their mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned to Rio and rolled her lips. She wasn’t exactly upset, but Nicky had always come to her with things, and knowing he had gone to someone else had tied her stomach into a small knot. “He asked you for advice?” There was a shadow of hurt in her tone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took Agatha’s hand. “Yes, I should have told you. He came to me today and asked me what he should get for Morgan. I asked him why he had asked me when there were three other women to ask. Agatha, he said I’m his other mom.” Rio’s eyes filled with tears at the words she hadn’t quite processed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled genuinely, though she was just as conflicted as she had been a few months ago. “I know he’s made references to it a few times, I’m just still getting used to sharing him with someone I’m romantically involved with. Decisions, what little discipline he requires, advice, and whatever else is needed. I know I’ve shared these things with the others, but this is different.” Agatha’s thumb drew circles on the back of Rio’s hand. “I’m going to be out of the country for over half of the summer and away from both of you. I know he has several invitations to schools for visits and a few football camps.” Agatha paused, gathering the words. She knew she would be asking a lot of Rio. “You can say no, but since you’ll be living here, and he considers you a parent, would you go on his visits with him and share everything with me? It’s ultimately his decision, but I’d still like to know information about the programs, how the trips were, and both of your thoughts. I want to know that he is with someone I trust to guide him. I know you have the best intentions in mind for him, like I do.” Agatha looked hopeful as she looked into Rio’s eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn’t sure how to respond. Agatha wanted her to go through this crucial milestone with Nicky? “Of course. Your summer is busy enough. I do have his best intentions at heart, and yours.” She leaned forward and kissed Agatha slowly, placing her palm over Agatha’s heart. “I love you both, very much,” Rio whispered when she drew back and dropped her forehead to Agatha’s shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We love you too.” The knot in Agatha’s stomach had dissipated, and she knew that this was right. Rio was the person with whom she wanted to co-parent Nicky or any future children.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Prom night, like all high school milestones, was a ritual Morgan had been looking forward to. Her dress was a one-shoulder, gold-sequined, floor-length gown with three straps across the back for extra support so she wasn’t tugging it up all night. Her hair was in an up-do and her dad wanted her to wear a scarf because of it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky wore a tux with a gold vest and bowtie. Both sequined, he was committed to matching. His moms had insisted on tagging along to the Starks so they could take pictures. It meant as much to Nicky that Rio was there for this, too, like a second primary mother. She loved him, and even if neither woman wanted to admit it, he knew Agatha and Rio would get married eventually. He saw how worried she had been when he got in that fight, and when he had gotten in that car accident. That wasn’t the look of a concerned teacher or family friend. That was the look of a worried parent. Right now both of them were beaming at him as they took pictures of the young couple dressed in their sparkly prom attire.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The parents finally let them go on their way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked over at Agatha and Tony. “Did either of you tell them Chappell was performing?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Now, why would we ruin that surprise?” Agatha took Rio’s hand to lead her to the car.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I promised her I wouldn’t let anyone know she was here.” Tony and Agatha had both pulled the strings for their special guest, Tony had kept her under the radar.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pepper pat him on the back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You did a great job, honey.” She looked at the two women as she guided Tony toward the house. “I had to take his phone away so he didn’t tell everyone.”

      The last week of school was showcase week and to Rio, each day brought with it a fresh new hell. Thankfully, the last day of school was Thursday, and Friday they were all going to the beach house for Memorial Day weekend.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Alice had already taken care of their end-of-the-year duties and would be able to leave as soon as the bell rang on Thursday. First, they had to get through four days of student exhibits and showcases.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky, Tommy, and Eddie were playing in a football scrimmage -Tommy and Eddie would be playing on varsity the next year. For the football events, Agatha and Rio wore matching “Football Mom” shirts that both read Harkness on the back with Nicky’s number. Nat’s shirt had Maximoff on the back with Tommy’s number, and Herb wore a “Football Dad” shirt, but whose back matched Nat’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy wore his Football Boyfriend shirt with pride.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Academic and fine arts projects were on display, and both Rio and Alice were very proud of their student's hard work throughout the year, specifically the students of the coven. Tommy’s grades had improved immensely and his projects demonstrated it. Cassie had a lot to do with that, she encouraged Tommy to study and she found ways to make it fun for him. Wanda didn’t ask questions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The basketball team also had a scrimmage and a teachers vs. students game. Agatha wore her Vidal jersey and cheered extra loudly when she watched Rio play. Rio was not nice to the girls at all, and the teachers won easily. Morgan grumbled the whole time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia laughed as she watched, she knew Rio had won a National Championship in college. The girls didn't.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy showed off his talent by doing a one-act play and a choir concert where he had a lead part and a solo. Wanda and Agatha were so proud. Jen already had a few people in mind to call about the kid.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was finally Thursday and as Rio locked her classroom door, ending her first year at SHIELD, she looked forward to the future. This weekend was going to be all about beach time. Then she would move in with Agatha the following week.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>

      Rio walked to her car, confidently optimistic for the future.

      Agatha watched her family from the balcony of the beach house during the first weekend of summer. It was the calm before the whirlwind of summer filming, and they had all gathered to kick it off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The teens were in the ocean and the boys were attempting to show off their surfing skills and doing terribly. She couldn’t make out expressions from where she stood, but she could tell that Morgan and Cassie were laughing as Tommy wiped out. Billy had snuck up behind Eddie and dunked him. The kids were being kids, and it warmed her heart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Directly below her by the pool; Vision, Alice, Nat, and Herb were drinking, grilling, and laughing while Wanda, Jen, and Rio were planning the Maximoff-Romanov wedding that was only a few weeks away now. Agatha was ecstatic that the wedding, which had been twenty-five years in the making, would finally be happening. Wanda looked on the edge of joyful tears as she continuously looked at Nat and Vision. The two people who had come together and supported her throughout everything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And Herb. Herb who had been Vision’s friend for as long as any of them had known Vision. Wanda’s worries about someone coming into Vision’s life and not understanding the relationship between them completely dissipated once Herb entered the picture. This teddy bear of a man didn’t mind the pecks on the cheek and forehead the exes gave each other or the pet names. They were close friends, and co-parents that still loved each other. Wanda and Vision didn’t divorce because they didn’t love each other, they divorced each other because they did, and Herb understood that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The man, like Nat, was a national treasure.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had come into this life, born to a woman who did not want her. She became famous at an extremely young age based entirely on luck and was still convinced that her fame was the only reason Evanora had not killed her when she was a young child. She had met Lorna Wu as a pre-teen, and the woman took pity on her, hatching a plan to save her from her circumstances, and she had.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lorna Wu had taught Agatha what family was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It had gone off track a time or two, and she had lost people along the way and gained so many. Nearly forty years later, and here she was, Lorna gone, but her legacy lived on. Agatha and Lilia were restoring their relationship, and Lilia, her rightful place in the family.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Alice had grown closer and had a deeper understanding of each other, as well as Lorna. Agatha looked on and caught Jen watching Alice with pure love in her eyes. Agatha knew Jen had her own skeletons and only let certain people in. She had been so hesitant about taking the leap with Alice, even though they could all see the love between them. Now, here they were, married, living on the compound, about to adopt a dog. Alice turned to see Jen watching her and walked over to join the planning group, bending down to kiss her wife.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was filled with a comfortable warmth watching all of them and the familiar pang of Lorna’s absence. It didn’t hurt like it had in the past, it was just the awareness that she wasn’t physically there. Having Lilia back had eased the pain. Having two-thirds of the original trio back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had been in a staggering amount of movies, TV shows, commercials, plays, and musicals. She was no stranger to various genres of entertainment. She knew that life imitated art, and if you asked her which genre was her favorite, she would tell you it was life. After all, her life had everything. Romance, mystery, intrigue, murder, angst, anything you wanted, and a lot of things she hadn’t but was better for. Rio looked up and raised her water bottle toward her in a small toast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha raised hers back and smiled lovingly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned her head as Lilia walked up behind her as if Lilia had been summoned by her thoughts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, you and Sharon?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia chuckled. “I was wondering when you were going to ask.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That woman is in love with you.” Agatha leaned forward and rested her forearms on the railing in front of her. “And you’re in love with her, or as close as Lilia Calderu has ever come to it. I’ve seen how you look at her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia hummed. “I remember someone telling me that once before, about a woman being in love with me. I lost my two best friends because of it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stood to her full height and put a comforting hand on Lilia’s shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “ That was then, this is now, and you’re not that person anymore. You’re older and wiser. I know you’re only dating women now, and I know she’s the only one, you’re also the only person she’s seeing.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia smirked and raised an eyebrow. “Well, look who took a page from Wanda’s playbook.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am not meddling. Call it a welfare check if you must.” Agatha dropped her hand from Lilia’s shoulder, taking Lilia’s hand instead. “Lils, I’m not saying shack up and get married, I’m saying give her a chance and let her in. She’s a great woman. She put up with a very angry me when I broke my leg, remember? She also put up with me multiple times trying to detox with Lorna. She can handle your not-so-law-abiding self.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia but the inside of her lip. “She’s a tough woman, I know she can. But monogamy? Neither of us has been monogamous since the seventies, Agatha.” Lilia looked as though Agatha had asked her to impale herself with swords.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed at the thought of either woman in a completely traditional relationship. “No, I would never suggest either of you do that. I’m saying make each other a primary relationship, the majority of your love lives. Whatever that looks like for you two. More than just a few weekends a year, Lilia.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll think about it. Neither one of us has said the L word, and we’ve been, having our fun, for years now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha squeezed Lilia’s hand before letting it go. “Good, I just want what’s best for you,” she parroted Lilia’s words back to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, kid. I know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned back on the railing, something about the tone around the familiar phrase Lilia loved to use nagging at the back of her mind. She had to ask Lilia, who also leaned on the railing beside her. Agatha looked at her, considering everything she knew about her old mentor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It was you, wasn’t it? Not Nat. Every single time something needed to be handled?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia gave a wry smile. “Never send a Russian to do an Italian job.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head as she left Lilia at the railing, smiling the whole time, knowing that Lilia had still always been there throughout the years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She joined everyone by the pool and seated herself behind Rio, letting the gorgeous woman lean back into her chest as she would a chair. Wrapping her arms around Rio, Agatha gave her a chaste kiss and looked at her family around her. She knew that this was exactly where Lorna had wanted them to be, and that warmed her heart all the more.

     Hello lovely readers!
     <br/>
     While posting, I kept saying I was going to update the first few chapters.
     <br/>
     Well, I did that. Today (May 6th, 2025), I updated chapters one through five. They are amazing and added quite a few words...
     <br/>
     I have updates for other chapters too, especially six, but it's not ready to be posted yet. I added the scene of Alice asking Jen out, and it's cute y'all.
    </p>
<p>
     But Ellen (my pen name), what did you change/add/edit?
     <br/>
     Well, I know the first several chapters were without a beta/editor (DaretoDream82). Because of that, they were rushed and I was still very rusty in my return to writing. We have more inner dialogue, more character development, just
     <em>
      more
     </em>
     . The first part feels more like the rest of the fic. I also just working on continuity issues as a whole.
     <br/>
     ALSO, for those that did not follow the series, it IS a series now! I'm working on the next chapters for those right now. Good Luck Babe, the prequel of sorts, and I am Your Summer, the short mini-fic before the full-blown sequel.
     <br/>
     I was hoping to post for Agatha All Along week, but I may just keep on with what I'm doing, we'll see what happens.
     <br/>
     I will post updates as I update more chapters!
     <br/>
     PLEASE ENJOY THE NEWLY IMPROVED 1-5!
