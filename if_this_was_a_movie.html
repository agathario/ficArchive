     Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Agatha is THE Hollywood star, America's Sweetheart, and absolute Hollywood royalty. She is a single mom to 16-year-old Nicholas Harkness,  a student at SHIELD High School.
      <br/>
      Rio is the new, science teacher at the Hollywood elite school and holds a strict no dating parents policy.
     </p>
<p>
      When Agatha‚Äôs famous chaotic reverie meets Rio‚Äôs down-to-earth simplicity, the attraction should be undeniable. But, the winds of fate have more in store for these two and their coven of friends as they come to terms with their love and desire.

<p>
     ‚ÄúThere! It‚Äôs perfect!‚Äù Rio Vidal exclaimed as she placed the last plant on a bookshelf. Her new Los Angeles apartment was now completely unpacked and decorated. It felt like home.
    </p>
<p>
     She took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of the orchids and azaleas placed around the apartment. They weren‚Äôt the easiest plants to grow in planters and keep inside, but she had learned from the best. The bamboo plant was tucked into the corner of the dining room, which she took meticulous care of, and the succulents, which she carefully trimmed. They were probably her most prized possessions, something she had control over in a life in which she felt she had such little control.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou and your plants. You put more care into them than your actual lesson plans.‚Äù Alice Wu-Gulliver said from her spot on the couch with a teasing smile and changed the music playing on the Bluetooth speaker to a girl in red song.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio returned the smile as she looked over at her childhood best friend and pseudo-sister, and sat on the plush, forest-green couch beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúPlants need love and care, you know that. Lesson plans are automatic at this point and follow a pattern and set of rules. I can write them in my sleep by now, and so can you."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had taught science for thirteen years and loved it. She took care when she planned her lessons. She just knew the material well, especially biology, botany, and chemistry. Her three major loves growing up in San Francisco were animals, plants, and blowing things up.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo phoning it in at SHIELD, Ri. Calderu knows everything, and we have to keep the parents happy‚Äîor nannies, au pairs, whoever it is,‚Äù Alice said, leaning her head to the side. She began recounting the different families and broke down who did what roles in each.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio knew how high-stakes her new position at SHIELD was. The acronym stood for The School for Hollywood's Innovative Education and Leadership Development - a pretentious name for a place where Hollywood‚Äôs elite sent their children. Hardly anyone knew what it actually stood for anymore; it was simply SHIELD.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had first met the principal, Lilia Calderu, the previous spring when she had interviewed for the position from Rio‚Äôs hospital bed. She was an older, petite woman. Rio recalled how Alice had told her that Lilia had taught at SHIELD since she came to LA and had ingrained herself amongst the Hollywood elite, learning secrets and becoming someone they confided in. Now, she knew everything and was well-respected in the community. Her New York upbringing and Sicilian ancestry added to her persona, and when Rio first met her, she automatically understood.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice had taught in the history department at SHIELD since 2014 and helped Rio get an interview with Lilia once Rio told Alice she was leaving the school in San Francisco. The elite school in Los Angeles generally ran on a who-you-knew hiring system due to the unique demographics of the student body.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled. ‚ÄúRelax. I've got this, and you‚Äôre the reason I have this job. I‚Äôm not going to make you look bad. I‚Äôve taught the children of the rich and powerful before. My old school catered to the upper class, too. This won‚Äôt be too different from that, from the sounds of it. Signing non-disclosure agreements as a career requirement is a little odd, and having seen some of the parents naked in movies, or having crushes on them, might be awkward at first, but I‚Äôll adjust.‚Äù Seeing Alice‚Äôs face scrunch at that, Rio got serious and held up her hand. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I learned my lesson about dating parents, especially famous ones, okay? That‚Äôs the entire reason I left and moved here, remember?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had made the mistake of dating a parent once, almost ruining her career. It had turned into a stalker situation when the woman could not let go, and after a series of unfortunate events, Rio had escaped for LA as soon as possible.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice smirked. ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs not dating I‚Äôm worried about.‚Äù Alice lifted an eyebrow suggestively.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed and smacked her with a decorative pillow that said ‚ÄúLive Laugh Lesbian‚Äù on it, a housewarming gift from Alice one year. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs allowed!‚Äù She said, still laughing. Fraternization had been expressly forbidden at her previous school, which had complicated matters.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the reasons we sign NDAs!‚Äù Alice exclaimed back, holding her arms up to block the pillow.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stopped her barrage, tossed the pillow onto a forest green armchair to her right that matched the couch, and grabbed her beer from the coffee table.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSeriously, though, Alice, thank you so much for helping with everything. The job, finding the apartment, and being by my side. I am actually looking forward to professional development and in-service tomorrow for once, and not dreading it. I‚Äôm very curious to see who my students are, and more importantly, who their parents are.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a swig of her beer and reminisced on her previous years of teaching. Tomorrow would begin her fourteenth time preparing for a new school year, and it had long since lost its excitement. However, teaching in the same school as Alice for the first time in a decade and at this specific school was the beginning of a new adventure, and it reminded her of their first year of teaching.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice took a drink from her beer as well. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad you‚Äôre finally here, and I can finally share everything with you again. The apartment was perfect timing since my neighbor moved out.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Alice and Rio had lived together before and were roommates in college and young adulthood when they taught together. Now, at thirty-five, they needed their own space but wanted to remain close. If the apartment next to Alice hadn‚Äôt come available, then they had both planned on hunting for the perfect place with two units together, or a duplex. They hadn‚Äôt been as close the past ten years due to distance and legalities. It had taken a toll on both of them, and it was time to put an end to that.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre the only one excited about starting in-service at seven AM on a Monday at the end of July. Class lists are fun, especially at the high school level when we know most of them so well and what to expect. We can also just email or text the parents, personal assistants, or PR people in some cases now, depending on the type of relationship you have with that family, of course.¬† Some of the parents are pretty hands-on, which is unexpected for the higher-level celebrities, but nice, especially when it is the megastars.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took another pull of her beer and put it back on a plant-shaped coaster before settling back into the couch. ‚ÄúWhich parents are super involved?‚Äù She held up a hand before Alice could object. ‚ÄúI have already signed my stack of NDAs and can know, so tell me.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice grumbled, though she had been dying to tell her best friend, her sister, really, about everything that happened at SHIELD and in LA in general. She wanted to tell her all about the families and her close friendships with some of the parents. She couldn‚Äôt wait for Rio to start joining her in spending time with her and her friends. Alice was so glad to have Rio back in her life for more than just holidays and breaks, and was ready to pick up where they had left off.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWell, for starters, Agatha Harkness and Wanda Maximoff are supermoms, believe it or not,‚Äù Alice responded, gesturing with her hands.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Wanda were both award-winning and globally beloved actresses. Given Agatha Harkness‚Äôs ‚Äòbad boy‚Äô persona, she knew that would surprise Rio. The media always portrayed them as doting moms with very busy schedules. There were also conflicting rumors that Agatha and Wanda were dating.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, meeting Alice‚Äôs expectations, was shocked. ‚ÄúAgatha Harkness? THE Agatha Harkness? America‚Äôs Lesbian Badass Sweetheart and everyone‚Äôs favorite Mother? That Agatha Harkness? HER SON GOES TO SHIELD?!‚Äù She shrieked the last part. Rio had been a fan of Agatha‚Äôs since before she could remember.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness was a trailblazer for LGBTQ equality, especially in Hollywood. She was a single mom, championing fertility procedures and putting a spotlight on reproductive methods, all families, and being a single mother by choice. She was also absolutely stunning, a global megastar and one of the greatest stars of their time. At fifty-one, Agatha was on her way to a triple EGOT ‚Äî meaning she had won all four major awards, an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony, had been the youngest EGOT winner, the youngest Oscar nominee, the youngest Oscar winner, and just all around glass ceiling breaker. She was also known for her multitude of relationships, if you could call them that. It was part of what made Agatha, well, Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had very publicly cut ties with her mother at sixteen, and the entire country had rallied behind their teenage sweetheart, supporting her and embracing her identity. Everyone loved a juicy story, and Agatha had one. Rio had idolized her, and still did, though she had toned it down a lot since her youth. That woman had been her gay awakening. If she were to encounter her now, she might die.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The moment the realization dawned on her, her naturally tanned skin went pale, and she looked at Alice, mouth agape. Agatha‚Äôs son, Nicholas, was a teenager. Not that Rio followed Agatha on social media or anything, or that she knew he had just had a birthday in June.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAgatha‚Äôs son, Nicky, he‚Äôs going to be a sophomore or a junior this year, yeah?‚Äù Rio asked, attempting to sound casual.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice laughed. The last ten years of non-disclosure agreements had bound Alice from discussing anything school-related with Rio. Unfortunately, since her friends and chosen family were also the parents of her students, this included much of her life. She had been dying to share all of this with her, and she knew that this specific information would absolutely break Rio‚Äôs brain and send her spinning.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to be a junior, you creepy lurker. He‚Äôs the quarterback of the football team,‚Äù Alice said, smirking.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still getting used to there being sports and it being just like any other all-American high school and not like the one in ‚ÄòFame‚Äô.‚Äù Rio interrupted. Alice rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRemember, it‚Äôs more than just the children of movie stars. It‚Äôs child actors, the children of star athletes, musicians, billionaires, the one percent, the elite, and even a few rocket scientists. Anyway, he has no interest in acting or stardom, is incredibly smart like his mother, and can be a troublemaker. He‚Äôs respectful, but if there are any pranks or general shenanigans, he‚Äôs historically been behind them. Agatha knows he‚Äôs not perfect, and she does hold him accountable. She‚Äôs a great mom. The Maximoff boys will be freshmen this year, and while Billy is a pure theatre kid, Tommy idolizes Nicky and will follow where Nicky leads, historically.‚Äù She finished and looked at Rio to make sure she was still breathing. She was, but still had surprise and a bit of panic in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDid you just call her Agatha and a great mom?‚Äù Rio‚Äôs eyes were glued to Alice as she drained her beer. ‚ÄúGod, Alice. I have got to get a grip before we have Meet the Teacher night next week and school starts in two weeks.‚Äù Rio rubbed the left side of her chest to soothe herself from all the new information. A habit she had picked up from her childhood. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the real story with Agatha and Wanda? Are the rumors true, or are they just really close like we are?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had always wondered about that relationship and Wanda Maximoff herself. The two stars had been fixtures in each other‚Äôs lives for nearly 30 years, were often each other‚Äôs ‚Äòdate‚Äô to awards shows, starred together often, and were frequently pictured together. Yes, Wanda was married to Vision, and they had twins, but it was still very suspicious. Wanda never looked entirely comfortable when she was with Vision, always looking at something or someone, off to the side. There was an entire corner of the internet dedicated to the theory.

<p>
     Alice had gone into the kitchen and grabbed water, yogurts from the fridge, and a bag of pretzels. She walked back in, handing one of each to Rio and putting the bag of pretzels between them.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMost parents prefer first names, less formal, especially since their kids have been there since pre-K.‚Äù She sat back down, curling her legs under her. She chewed her lip in thought. Rio could tell Alice was debating whether or not she should add something to that. ‚ÄúAs for Agatha and Wanda, they‚Äôre more sisters than anything. Agatha took her under her wing on the first show they did together, shortly after Wanda moved here when she was still a teenager. They had similar stories, you know that. They‚Äôre the emergency contacts for the boys. If one is out of town, the other picks up the slack. If they‚Äôre both gone, Vision is on kid duty. It‚Äôs a very cohesive family unit. Wanda is ‚ÄòAunt Wanda‚Äô and Agatha is ‚ÄòAunt Aggie‚Äô.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had known Alice since they were twelve and had been taken in by Alice and her Gran. Rio knew Alice was holding back.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAlice, stop holding back. You obviously know a lot. How?‚Äù Rio raised an eyebrow in question.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice sighed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAgatha and Wanda are some of my closest friends. They‚Äôre more like my family. When I moved out here, Agatha insisted that they help me get acclimated. Something my mother and Gran would have wanted.‚Äù She shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, hurt that Alice hadn‚Äôt told her, but Rio knew that technically, due to Agatha and Wanda being connected with the school, that was part of the NDAs.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice‚Äôs mother, Lorna Wu, had been an actress as well. A friend of Agatha‚Äôs and the reason Alice had been raised by Gran, Lorna‚Äôs mother. Lorna wanted to keep Alice as far away from Hollywood life as possible and had rarely been in Alice‚Äôs life. Rio had met Lorna several times and thought she would have been a great mom.
    </p>
<p>
     Lorna thought otherwise. Rio was also hurt that Alice had called these women her family. Rio was happy that Alice had found a family in LA, but Rio had been so alone in their hometown once Alice left. Alice was her family.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice continued, bringing Rio back from her thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúKnowing them for so long, it weirds me out when I hear gossip about the two of them being an item because they are more like sisters than anything else. Agatha practically helped raise Wanda,‚Äù Alice had finished her yogurt at that point and was using her spoon as emphasis. ‚ÄúImagine if we were to date,‚Äù she added, grimacing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gasped, not as insulted as she probably should be.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHEY! I am a catch! You would be lucky to date me!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     She laughed, knowing Alice was right. They had known each other for twenty-three years, and even though they had been each other‚Äôs first kiss ‚Äòfor practice‚Äô, could be tactile with each other without issue, and could hold the other through heartbreak, actually dating or anything else would just feel wrong. Rio got up to throw away their empty yogurt cups and put away the spoons.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI get it, though. We would co-parent with each other if we were to have kids. That‚Äôs never going to happen, though. I much prefer cats and plants, and you are a dog person. I still can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm going to teach Agatha Fucking Harknesses‚Äôs son.‚Äù Rio walked back to the living room and leaned against the doorway. Alice turned to look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRemember, you said you weren‚Äôt going to mix with your students‚Äô parents romantically.‚Äù Alice teased, a knowing gleam in her eye.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, please, she‚Äôs fifty-one. I am way too young for her. Just because she was once my dream woman,‚Äù
     <em>
      And I damn near died the few times she was at Gran‚Äôs when we were growing up,
     </em>
     she thought to herself. ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt mean a thing. I am a professional, and I will stick to my personal rules and boundaries. If these women are your friend group, I assume you‚Äôre going to drag me into it. Dating your friends typically doesn‚Äôt go well for me either. I can look and admire, though. ‚Äù Rio shrugged, pushing off from the doorway to sit back on the couch, picking up the bag of pretzel sticks and opening it. ‚ÄúBesides, my last girlfriend was much older, started as a friend, had kids, and look how that turned out.‚Äù She took a bite of a pretzel. ‚ÄúSo, tell me about the parents that are not your friends.‚Äù Rio pulled her knees under her and munched on the pretzels as Alice launched into stories about the Starks, Langs, Sam Wilson, and other famous parents.
    </p>
<p>
     They finally called it a night around ten as they had to be at work early to start preparing for the semester. Alice stretched as she unfolded herself and got up, almost falling over as she stood, and shook out her legs and feet to regain circulation in them.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou probably should‚Äôve tested that out first,‚Äù Rio laughed, putting her feet on the ground first before standing. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt sit folded in on ourselves for that long and just pop up like daisies without consequence anymore. Lock the door behind you, please!‚Äù Rio stood once the tingling in her own legs had faded and turned toward her bedroom. The two had keys to each other‚Äôs places, partially for this reason.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWill do, love you!‚Äù Alice called over her shoulder as she left.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúLove you too,‚Äù Rio shouted back. It was a habit they had. Something they had learned firsthand to do. Always tell the people around you that you loved them every time you departed, no matter where they were going or how long they would be gone. She heard the door close and lock. She would go back and lock the deadbolt before bed. Right now, she needed a shower after all the moving and unpacking from the day. She turned on music for the shower speaker, background noise so she didn‚Äôt feel alone, and headed for the en-suite, glancing at a tortoiseshell-colored lump in the middle of her bed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThere you are, Raven! I see you‚Äôre making yourself at home.‚Äù Raven was her seventeen-year-old cat. Rio had adopted her when she and Alice had their first place fifteen years ago, and Rio had retained custody ever since.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Once under the shower‚Äôs hot water, enveloped in steam with Taylor Swift playing in the background, Rio massaged the shampoo onto her scalp and thought about the upcoming school year and what lay ahead. She would meet some huge celebrities from sports, film, music, and even politics. She was excited and nervous about this journey, and hoped her past didn‚Äôt follow her here. Shampoo was washed out and switched to conditioner as she remained lost in her thoughts, thinking about the colleagues she had already met, the insane security detail, and the security measures. When you had that many famous children altogether, you had to have heightened security, extra legal measures, and state-of-the-art everything. She couldn‚Äôt imagine the pressure put on the administration or the board of trustees.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was excited about the budget, though, and the opportunities it provided. The tuition, donations from parents, and unnecessary fundraisers throughout the year, though half of it went to charity, would provide ample funding for teachers to do anything they wanted for their students.
    </p>
<p>
     She scrubbed the sweat and grime from unpacking off her skin as she thought back on her conversations with Alice and what that meant for the future. Exactly how much had gone unsaid for the past ten years? Rio had still told Alice everything in the past decade. Her dating life, career woes, dating woes, and the stalker issue. Alice had come and bailed her out in the spring when she had hit her version of rock bottom.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hadn‚Äôt known much about Alice‚Äôs life in LA. She knew about a few people she had dated and knew she had made friends, but nothing beyond that. They still spent holidays and birthdays together, but even then, a lot of things had been vague. Alice had always been Rio‚Äôs protector, they joked about Alice being her Knight of Wands. A callback to a movie Alice‚Äôs mother, Lorna, had been in with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She turned off the water and dried herself off. She was hoping that she and Alice could become as close as they once were, now that Rio had signed the same paperwork that Alice had. This whole weekend, and tonight especially, had been a good start. They so easily fell back into their old habits.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was also somewhat worried about how well she would teach this demographic of children. Yes, she had taught kids with famous parents before, but not at this high of a caliber. Not children who were potentially not impressed by anything, and had access to all types of educational resources if they wanted to utilize them. How was she supposed to keep them engaged in learning? Maybe she wasn‚Äôt cut out to teach the children of the Hollywood elite, and elite in general. She sighed. Clearly, this was just impostor syndrome. Everything would be fine. Lilia wouldn‚Äôt have offered her the position if she didn‚Äôt think she was more than capable. SHIELD paid ridiculously well and did not hire just anyone. You had to be overly qualified and know someone.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She climbed into bed, exhausted, and Raven snuggled up to her, knowing she was stressed. Rio set her alarm and switched to her bedtime playlist. The very first song was from a movie Agatha had starred in with Lorna Wu called ‚ÄúThe Witches Road‚Äù. Agatha had sung the theme song for the movie, winning her a Grammy and an Oscar for the song and best actress. It was one of Rio‚Äôs favorites, and she drifted off to sleep with Agatha‚Äôs voice in her ear as she had so many times before.

<p>

      ‚ÄúPlease welcome my next guest, the double EGOT winner, multiple everything winner, America‚Äôs Sweetheart, activist, just all-around amazing person, and one of my personal close friends, Agatha Harkness!‚Äù
     </em>
     Drew Barrymore announced to a round of applause and cheers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha walked out and danced to Demi Lovato‚Äôs ‚ÄòConfident‚Äô, meeting Drew halfway. Agatha had originally suggested ‚ÄòWomanizer‚Äô, but Drew reminded her that she had already done that once. It had been during a time when Agatha had been pictured out with multiple women each night. Agatha had been having a great time, and so had the media. ‚ÄòConfident‚Äô was more fitting this time.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wore a black halter jumpsuit with purple stilettos, her signature color and shoe style. Her long chestnut hair was pulled up, and her iconic three-goddesses locket was perfectly attached at the collar. Agatha was just the appropriate amount of professionalism and attractiveness for daytime TV, a balance she had perfected decades ago. Drew looked extremely adorable as always in a white long-sleeve shirt, dark grey pants with a matching vest, a purple tie that matched Agatha‚Äôs shoes, and purple ballet flats. They had coordinated previously on colors, and Drew looked very
     <em>

     </em>
     . She was only two years Agatha‚Äôs junior but exuded a youthful energy. Agatha and Drew had been in an exclusive circle of child actors who had known each other since they were in diapers and had very easy chemistry as they were friends outside of acting. Drew pulled Agatha into a giant hug as the excitement from the audience died down.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDrew! It‚Äôs so good to be here again!‚Äù She said as she settled into her place on the guest couch and crossed her legs at the knee. ‚ÄúThe girls aren‚Äôt too sunburned from this weekend, are they?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Drew waved off the question. ‚ÄúNot anything a little aloe vera couldn‚Äôt soothe. We had such a great time hanging out with you guys this weekend! We even have some pictures!‚Äù As Drew said it, pictures popped up on the screen positioned between them. One of Drew, Agatha, and Wanda around Agatha‚Äôs pool in swimsuits, a second of Wanda‚Äôs twin boys, Agatha‚Äôs son, and Drew‚Äôs two daughters, and the final was a picture of Nicky pushing Agatha into the pool. The audience laughed, and Agatha pretended to be shocked. Drew smiled and continued.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAs everyone knows by now, we‚Äôve known each other most of our lives, and you‚Äôre one of my most popular guests.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOf course I am,‚Äù Agatha smirked, drawing reactions from the audience.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAlways so humble,‚Äù Drew quipped. ‚ÄúBefore we start, I wanted to give you something to put with all of those awards you have.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed in response. It was the natural chemistry she and Drew had that kept the producers, and Drew, insisting on her coming back.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúCan I guess what it is first?‚Äù Agatha asked, raising her eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOf course, I wasn‚Äôt going to make it easy, you get three guesses.‚Äù Drew was aglow with excitement.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was in full character, the persona she put on for the cameras, and she knew Drew was prepared to match this side of her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obviously an award, so, hottest guest of all time?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Drew rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúNice try, no.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOkay, then simply Mother Harkness or Most Likely to Lead an Army of Sapphics.‚Äù She winked toward the audience, where she swore half of them swooned. People often asked Agatha why she didn‚Äôt date, and why would she? Why use just one crayon when there were so many different colors to choose from?
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI should have gone with the biggest ego, no. Most Reoccurring Guest. This is the first week of our fifth season and your eighth time here.‚Äù Drew handed Agatha a plaque.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAnytime, Drew.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Drew switched gears back to the previous weekend. ‚ÄúSo, back to the pictures and the weekend, I keep having Agatha come back because she constantly has new projects going on, but also we‚Äôre friends, as you can see in the pictures.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. ‚ÄúWanda Maximoff lives next door,‚Äù Agatha heard snickers from a few people in the audience whom she was addressing. She would never beat those allegations. ‚ÄúSo any party or gathering at my house usually involves her and her family as well. Our three boys are in high school and get along so well with Drew‚Äôs daughters, though they‚Äôre in middle school. We‚Äôre soaking up the last few weeks of summer and had a little impromptu pool party.‚Äù She turned back to Drew to let her continue leading the conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYour son, Nicky, just turned sixteen. How‚Äôs driving going?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     The audience groaned in sympathy.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. ‚ÄúYes, thank you. I thought him playing football was nerve-racking! I‚Äôm just glad I‚Äôm not in charge of the driving. Vision, Wanda‚Äôs husband for those of you who don‚Äôt know, has been in charge of that, so I don‚Äôt wind up in the news. He‚Äôs extremely patient, whereas I am not, and Wanda is too nervous, and Nat, our head of security.‚Äù There were a few claps and cheers from the audience at the mention of Nat. She had a small cult following. Agatha flashed a slightly evil grin. ‚ÄúLadies, she is single.‚Äù Drew threw her a dark look before Agatha continued. ‚ÄúAnyway, she is not the one you want teaching your sixteen-year-old to drive. We‚Äôve decided that Vision is in charge of teaching all the kids to drive, including Drew‚Äôs girls.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Drew nodded before pivoting.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSpeaking of Wanda and her family, your new movie,
     <em>
      Death‚Äôs Beloved,
     </em>
     premieres in October, and there‚Äôs already a lot of buzz around it. The two of you star opposite each other yet again, in a romantic role?‚Äù Drew‚Äôs right eyebrow quirked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed sarcastically and shook her head as the audience cheered. People were obsessed with the thought of her and Wanda being an item. They couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôre married. I‚Äôm a detective chasing a serial killer, and Wanda is my wife. In the movie. We have a few scenes, and they are very well done. I‚Äôm so glad she‚Äôs the person I got to do it with. We have such great chemistry, and given that I consider her to be my sister.‚Äù She sent a look toward the audience. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt seem awkward or anything. Our intimacy coordinator was amazing.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWow,‚Äù Drew‚Äôs bright eyes sparkled. ‚ÄúI cannot wait. We‚Äôve all heard the song already, and it‚Äôs gorgeous. Do you think this will be your third Best Actress Oscar win and third Grammy win? Completing that third EGOT?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only August, and we‚Äôre still months away from nominations. I have no idea if the song or I will be nominated, and we know that doesn‚Äôt guarantee a win. If anything, Wanda deserves a nomination and a win for her work in the movie. Working opposite of her as another lead was amazing, and I hope we‚Äôre both nominated as leads since that‚Äôs truly what we are. There wasn‚Äôt a leading man, and I hope that is acknowledged.‚Äù She stated firmly. ‚ÄúLike you said, it‚Äôs not even out until October, and so much can happen between now and then.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Drew nodded seriously. ‚ÄúI agree with you, and we‚Äôve discussed that it‚Äôs time for the awards committees to recognize that the leads do not have to be different genders and we need a broader range of categories.‚Äù A cheer of agreement went up in the audience. They chatted a bit more about the movie, Agatha sang the song ‚ÄúMy Beloved‚Äù, and they wrapped the show.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     While resetting to begin taping the next episode, Drew gave Agatha a quick hug goodbye and thanked her for doing the show again.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDid you see the picture of the new high school science teacher? Rio Vidal?‚Äù Drew asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. She hadn‚Äôt checked her email yet, though she was usually very eager to read about any new teachers joining the faculty for personal reasons. ‚ÄúNo, why?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gorgeous. Maybe you should read up on your science, given your history with teachers at SHIELD, this may be one you don‚Äôt want to miss out on.‚Äù Drew teased as she waggled her eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. ‚ÄúDrew, please. I have stopped sleeping with the teachers, starting this year. Calderu is getting too old to deal with all that drama. Plus, she‚Äôs probably extremely young ‚Äî ‚Äú
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs 35.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúExactly. I have an entire kid as old as that age gap. Thank you for trying, but you know me, Drew.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Drew and Wanda had been trying to get her to settle down for years, the hopeless romantics that they were. It wasn‚Äôt Agatha‚Äôs nature, she‚Äôd rather find ‚Äòem, fuck ‚Äòem, and free ‚Äòem. The three F‚Äôs. Agatha did not do romantic relationships, but she appreciated how much her friends cared.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Drew shook her head as she went back to the stage. ‚ÄúOne day, Aggie. One day, you‚Äôll find love!‚Äù Drew put her hand on her heart and exaggerated her gesture. ‚ÄúOh, and uh, Nat‚Äôs behind you, she looks pissed about your comment.‚Äù Drew turned and walked off briskly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha blew out a breath and turned to see her and Wanda‚Äôs main bodyguard. She was a petite redhead and a former Russian assassin. ‚ÄúIt was a joke, Nat.‚Äù Agatha quickly defended. She had known Nat almost as long as she had known Wanda, and had only been teasing.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou know I don‚Äôt date.‚Äù The younger woman said through clenched teeth, handing Agatha her bag and phone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. ‚ÄúNat, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNyet.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned. ‚ÄúYou need to get laid.‚Äù Agatha followed Nat out to the car waiting for them. It was mid-morning, and they were headed back to Agatha‚Äôs house before going up to Nicky‚Äôs school later in the afternoon. Agatha and Wanda both needed to speak to his football coach.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhat I need and what I want are two entirely different things,‚Äù Nat replied in Russian, careful others might overhear.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI got a few numbers of some very attractive women for you,‚Äù Agatha offered.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúKeep them, I did get the number of the woman with the blue and purple hair you kept looking at.‚Äù Nat handed it to her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the best wing-woman, Natasha.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>

    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked around her classroom and smiled. She had gotten everything set up the way she wanted it. The assignment turn-in stations, absent work, grouped seats, expectations, the lab, and all the equipment. Not bad for two days of work. She had also met with the other science teachers and had her two weeks of professional development, meetings, lesson planning, and other before-school starting activities scheduled. Meet the teacher night was exactly a week from today, and her butterflies about it were settling.
    </p>
<p>
     Ms. Calderu had already talked with the three new-to-campus teachers about what to expect, and Rio had Alice to advise her. Alice had been right when she said that teachers didn‚Äôt leave SHIELD until they retired or died. The rest of the faculty had been here for years, and Rio took comfort in that. It meant Rio had a lot of people she could go to if she had any questions. She checked her watch, it was three, and Rio and Alice planned to go down to the football field at 3:30. The team would be in the weight room, but Alice was going to point out Nicky and Tommy to Rio so she could familiarize herself with them. There were a few other students Alice wanted to introduce her to as well, if there was time, and Rio hoped there would be a few parents milling about‚Äînamely, Agatha and Wanda. Rio had just zipped up her green teacher bag when Alice came in, loaded down with her own teacher bag and work to take home.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI thought we could drop our stuff off at my car before we went down to the fieldhouse,‚Äù Alice said as she walked into the room and looked around at the transformed space. ‚ÄúWow, you wasted no time getting settled. It took me years to get my room the way I like it.‚Äù She added.
    </p>
<p>
     The two women had decided to carpool most days since they were coming from the same place. It made the most sense.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSure, let me just grab everything.‚Äù Rio gathered her own take-home work and looked down at her outfit. She wore a Phoenix Mercury shirt, her favorite WNBA team, denim shorts, and green Nikes. Her shoulder-length, dark brown hair was pulled back in a messy bun. She was a hot mess and looked like she had been working in her room all day, which she had been. ‚ÄúIs this appropriate attire to potentially meet parents or students in?‚Äù She gave Alice a skeptical look.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice scoffed. Her black and red hair was thrown up in a ponytail, and she wore an old Led Zeppelin shirt, basketball shorts, and Converse. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. Trust me, no one is dressed up around here until school starts. Everyone around here, students and parents, are still humans. Even Calderu had on joggers when I saw her earlier. It‚Äôs fine.‚Äù Alice reassured her as they walked out to her car. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure I saw part of Wagatha‚Äôs security detail though, if you need to freshen up or something,‚Äù Alice teased.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDid you just call them by their ship name?‚Äù Rio gasped. Alice had insisted the two weren‚Äôt together, yet here she was, using the ship name people who were convinced they were dating would use for them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice laughed. ‚ÄúEven
     <em>
      they

     agree it‚Äôs easier and use it for themselves. It‚Äôs a big joke to them.‚Äù Alice unlocked her Jeep as they dropped their stuff in the backseat, closed the doors, and relocked it. She joined arms with Rio and led her down to the field house. ‚ÄúBesides, it‚Äôs just Wanda Maximoff and Agatha Harkness. No big deal.‚Äù She added with a shit-eating grin.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her incredulously. ‚ÄúOkay, Ms. ‚ÄòMy Mom Was A Hollywood Star‚Äô and these are my friends. This isn‚Äôt exactly a normal Tuesday activity for me. Meeting your mom was one thing, and the few celebrities who dropped by, but this is completely different.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     The pair slowed as they approached the fieldhouse, which looked like it belonged to a college campus. A woman with dark red hair pulled back in a French braid that stopped between her shoulder blades, wearing a blue tank top and black shorts, stood beside the door, scrolling on her phone, but very alert.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHey, Alice! We‚Äôve missed you.‚Äù She said, not even looking up.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice waved. ‚ÄúHey, Nat. This is Rio Vidal, the sister I‚Äôve told you guys about and SHIELD‚Äôs new high school science teacher. Rio, this is Natasha Romanov. She‚Äôs on Wagatha‚Äôs security team, and yes, they share the team.‚Äù Natasha‚Äôs eyebrow rose slightly at that. Alice turned back to the redhead. ‚ÄúSo I assume they‚Äôre in there.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Natasha glanced over Rio for a bit longer than necessary before offering a hand in greeting. ‚ÄúNice to meet you, Ms. Vidal.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio blushed and returned the greeting. ‚ÄúPlease, call me Rio.‚Äù Was LA just crawling with attractive women? Had she died and gone to lesbian heaven?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRio, it is then. Call me Nat.‚Äù Nat looked back at Alice. ‚ÄúYes, they‚Äôre going over schedules with Coach Rogers.‚Äù She turned back to Rio. ‚ÄúTrying to work past the Agatha Harkness nerves before you‚Äôre surrounded next week?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio blushed. ‚ÄúIs it that obvious?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Nat gave her a sweet smile. ‚ÄúTrust me, you‚Äôre not the first one. She‚Äôs a big deal. I‚Äôve known her, both of them, forever. Don‚Äôt let her name or smile go to your‚Ä¶‚Äù She paused and looked her up and down. A gesture that the younger woman felt everywhere. ‚Äú...head.‚Äù She finished. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre both very devoted parents, and when they‚Äôre on this side of the country, they‚Äôre present at everything. Also, so you‚Äôre prepared, Agatha has on a low-cut shirt and Bermuda shorts that show off every muscle with random tennis shoes. Wanda is wearing a very cute and appropriate sleeveless, black sundress with sandals.‚Äù She said with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice laughed as she saw the shock on Rio‚Äôs face. She knew that Nat was teasing and playing with Rio. She had told her friends about Rio and how she hoped to pull her into the ‚Äòcoven‚Äô as they called themselves. This was Nat‚Äôs way of preparing Rio for the force that was Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúTrust us, Rio, it helps when you go in prepared. Now come on.‚Äù Alice grabbed her hand and swiped her badge for the door to open. Alice leaned in and whispered into Rio‚Äôs ear. ‚ÄúEspecially since she was your gay awakening.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs cheeks immediately went bright red.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They walked through the door, and Rio could hear the sounds of weights clinking against each other and boys purposefully grunting too hard. The air was also a mix of teenage boy sweat and various scents of Axe. She wanted to gag. They walked down the hall, and there in the main workroom were roughly forty boys on various machines. A tall boy of roughly sixteen who was running on a treadmill saw Alice, and his face lit up. He jammed his fingers against the buttons and hopped off, smacking the arm of the boy next to him. The boy who got off first had messy brown hair and blue eyes. He looked exactly like Agatha Harkness. The other boy was slightly shorter and thinner, not having as much muscle as the other, with straight brown hair and green eyes. He looked just like Wanda. They both came up to them grinning.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHey Ali-Ms.Wu!‚Äù Nicky said, as he turned to Rio. ‚ÄúYou must be Ms. Vidal. I‚Äôm Nicky Harkness, this is my cousin Tommy.‚Äù They both extended their hands, and she returned their greetings. They were very polite young men, but she wasn‚Äôt easily fooled. Rio was well-versed in teenage boys and had been warned by multiple faculty members about their true personas and the pranks they had pulled in the past.¬† Nicky turned back to look at Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMom and Aunt Wanda are talking to Coach Rogers in the office. I assume that‚Äôs why you came down here.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Alice raised an eyebrow in warning. ‚ÄúNo first names at school, Nicky. You know that,‚Äù she reminded him. Rio was starting to see what Alice had meant about her being close with Wagatha and their family.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Nicky and Tommy both nodded as they mumbled a ‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam,‚Äù and went back to their workouts. Alice turned and headed to the offices, not making it far as the women they were looking for had apparently completed their meeting and were heading back.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAlice!‚Äù Wanda exclaimed, a wide smile lighting up her face. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve missed you so much! You‚Äôve been so busy this summer, and we‚Äôve been wrapping projects.‚Äù She pulled the woman in for a hug. Agatha had been looking down at her phone, popped her head up upon hearing Alice‚Äôs name, and smiled brightly at her. She also pulled Alice in for a tight hug, greeting her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hung back, taking in the exchange. Realizing just how much of Alice‚Äôs life she had missed out on over the past decade. This looked like a small reunion, not reconnecting with the parents of students.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs train of self-pity derailed as Wanda‚Äôs bright green eyes landed on her. ‚ÄúYou must be Rio! Alice has told us about you.‚Äù Wanda pulled Rio into a hug, too, surprising Rio as she awkwardly hugged her back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Wanda, welcome to SHIELD.‚Äù Wanda released Rio, who turned, right toward Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had grown up with Alice Wu, the daughter of the legendary Lorna Wu. She had met Lorna several times. Rio had even met a few other celebrities as she revolved around the Lorna Wu star, but Agatha Harkness was always the star to beat. She was the Hollywood celebrity and ‚Äúit‚Äù woman of Rio‚Äôs most formative years. Now, here Rio was, about to meet her face-to-face as an adult. How she managed to have words or move was beyond her. She smiled and extended her hand. ‚ÄúHi, Ms. Harkness, I‚Äôm Rio, Nicky‚Äôs new science teacher.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her hand with a laugh. ‚ÄúOh, please, call me Agatha.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could‚Äôve sworn she saw something flicker across those ocean-blue eyes and that her smile wavered, but Rio wasn‚Äôt sure why and shrugged it off, chalking it up to her imagination. Rio was internally screaming and trying so hard to remain calm. Agatha‚Äôs smile was electric. She was pretty sure that if the school lost power, Agatha‚Äôs smile alone could light the entire campus.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to meet you, Agatha. I‚Äôm a huge fan.‚Äù She cringed internally‚Äîstupid thing to say. Agatha laughed again, her blue eyes sparkling.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWell, you know what they say, never meet your idols. Hopefully, I won‚Äôt disappoint you.‚Äù Agatha smiled genuinely, trying to keep her embarrassment from creeping across her face.
     <em>
      What the hell, Harkness? And stop laughing!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Eyebrow raised, Wanda glanced over at her best friend and took her cue. ‚ÄúWell, it smells like a teenage boy in here, and the mix of gym socks, Axe, and blue Gatorade is giving me a headache. Let‚Äôs continue this outside, shall we?‚Äù Wanda cleared her throat and slid her eyes down to where Agatha and Rio were still clasping hands. Agatha immediately dropped the younger woman‚Äôs hand and smoothed out her shorts absentmindedly.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYes, right, outside.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice looked over at Rio, who was pretending to be very interested in something on the floor as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The four women headed outside into the late July air. An awkward silence between them, with Wanda and Alice exchanging knowing looks. Once they were outside, Nat fell into step behind them as they headed to the car that Wanda and Agatha were in. The boys still had another hour to practice.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThere was a write-up about each teacher in the newsletter, but it didn‚Äôt say what brought you to LA, Rio. Any reason in particular?‚Äù Wanda asked, looking over at Rio. Ideas were formulating in her head. She knew Agatha better than anyone, and that woman had never ONCE reacted that way when meeting someone. Agatha always controlled the situation, flirted, and decided what type of encounter to have, and that was that. Alice had already prepared Agatha that Rio was her sister and not to make things awkward. Alice wanted Rio to find a place within their little family, not become another one of Agatha‚Äôs conquests.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda, seeing how Agatha had reacted and reading her the way Agatha Harkness herself had taught her to, was pretty sure Agatha didn‚Äôt want that either.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had practiced answering this question to ensure it sounded real. She would not be telling people that there had been a dating/break-up/stalker situation that ended in heartbreak and disaster.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThe school I was at had minimal growth potential, and I decided I needed a change. Alice and I have been friends, sisters, since we were twelve, so I came out here.‚Äù She gave a friendly smile in her reply.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda nodded and smiled back. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exciting! I‚Äôm so glad to have you join us here and look forward to getting to know you better. I wish we could chat more, but Agatha and I have a meeting to get to. We‚Äôll see you around this week, I‚Äôm sure, and for sure next week.‚Äù Wanda knew Rio‚Äôs answer was bullshit as she remembered Alice running off to San Francisco unexpectedly last spring, and Lilia following shortly after. Still, she wasn‚Äôt going to call her out, yet. She looked over at Agatha, who still had a stupid smile plastered on her face. They were at their car when Nat opened the door, trying to usher them inside. They waved and asked the two teachers to email the class syllabi over to them. They already had Alice‚Äôs, but they asked anyway.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Once Wanda was sure the other two women were on the way to their car, she smacked Agatha‚Äôs arm hard. ‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT HARKNESS?!
    </p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
     Rio slid into the seat and put her hands over her face. ‚ÄúFuck! I am so glad that the first meeting is over. I behaved like a tongue-tied fangirl. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a big fan, ‚Äô who admits that? She‚Äôs just so pretty, and confident, and involved, and‚Ä¶‚Äù She stared out the window as her words trailed off.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice was shaking her head as she pulled out of the parking lot. ‚ÄúAnd, she‚Äôs into you.‚Äù She said, ending her friend‚Äôs sentence, very matter-of-factly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio cackled. ‚ÄúShe absolutely is not. She was busy messaging or whatever, and I interrupted her.‚Äù Rio used her hand to emphasize her point. There was not a world in which Agatha Harkness, goddess, was interested in her: Rio Vidal, teacher, and regular person.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúOkay, sure. That‚Äôs what that was.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúExactly. Do you want me to make dinner tonight?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRemember, Ri. I‚Äôm friends with them. We hang out regularly. They‚Äôre family.‚Äù Alice said calmly, though Rio‚Äôs scream of excitement was deafening.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAgatha? Agatha? AGATHA!‚Äù Wanda had been trying to get Agatha‚Äôs attention since they had gotten in the car to no avail. Agatha could get so buried in her thoughts that she could block everything and everyone else out. Wanda waved her hand in front of her face, ‚ÄúYo, ground control to Major Tom!‚Äù Finally, the older woman snapped out of it and looked around the large SUV. First at Wanda and then at Nat.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Agatha finally replied, startled.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhat happened back there?‚Äù Wanda asked again.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha thought back on the last few minutes. She had raised her eyes and saw Rio. Her heart had quite possibly stopped when those brown eyes looked into her soul. Agatha had a body count a few miles long and she was no stranger to beautiful women, but this was different. She had also made an absolute fool of herself. She, who was always quick-witted and sure of herself, had said something stupid. Shook a hand for far too long. Needed Wanda to come to her rescue. Never in history had that happened before. Wanda was notoriously useless around women. She turned her eyes to Wanda and Nat.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI have no fucking idea.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda‚Äôs grin illuminated her whole face. ‚ÄúOh my God! You just fell hard for her! You like her!‚Äù She grabbed Agatha‚Äôs arm and shook her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow and looked at her best friend. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not. I‚Äôm just dehydrated or something.‚Äù Echoing a young woman she once knew. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs 16 years younger than me, a teacher at the school our children go to, and I do not fall for people. People fall for me and then get their hearts broken.‚Äù She replied.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs romantic.‚Äù Nat chimed in.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very upfront about it first,‚Äù Agatha added.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúBecause that makes it better,‚Äù Wanda added.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. ‚ÄúAnyway, everything is fine. It was a fluke.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned her head to look out the window. Every time she closed her eyes, she thought of Rio‚Äôs smile.
    </p>
<p>
     She remembered the phone number in her bag and knew she‚Äôd be tearing it up and throwing it away when they got home.
    </p>
<p>
     No reason.

       Late July
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda was buzzing with energy, which had nothing to do with the wine she had been drinking. Her best friend in the entire world finally liked someone, and she, Wanda Maximoff, had witnessed the meet-cute.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They sat in Agatha‚Äôs living room, music playing lightly in the background. Wanda was snuggled in the corner of the plush black couch, legs crossed in front of her, body turned so she could see Agatha on the opposite end of the couch, and Jennifer Kale on the couch perpendicular to them. Jen was their right-hand girl. Manager, agent, public relations, friend, and all-around go-to woman for whatever they needed. Nat sat beside Jen, nursing a drink and reading something on her tablet.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSo, let me get this right. Agatha Harkness, our Aggie, actually acted like a tongue-tied teenager in front of a beautiful woman who happens to be Alice‚Äôs best friend?‚Äù Jennifer asked, her brown eyes wide, mouth open in shock.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, shut up. Even on my worst days, I‚Äôm still as smooth as that head of yours.‚Äù Agatha shot back, referencing Jen‚Äôs most recent haircut, as she had chosen a very short fade that made her appear bald. She was gorgeous, though Agatha would never admit it, and Jen exuded confidence with it.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda knew that this was how Jen and Agatha communicated; the two of them needed each other to remain employed and on top of their respective careers.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen, not missing a beat, quirked an eyebrow. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than that rat‚Äôs nest you call hair.‚Äù She shot back.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúStop it, you two, or I‚Äôm taking away the wine,‚Äù Nat said sternly, but with a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     They both mumbled, ‚Äúshe started it,‚Äù but stopped bickering for the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAnyway,‚Äù Wanda continued, ‚Äúshe
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     Alice‚Äôs best friend, Agatha. You probably met her once or twice before Lorna died, since they‚Äôve been friends for so long. I vaguely remember seeing her at Lorna‚Äôs funeral,‚Äù she recalled.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha thought about it for a moment and turned to Jen.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe saw Alice a few times when she was young, for holidays and stuff. You know, Lorna kept her personal life and her Hollywood life divided, and Alice lived with Norma, Lorna‚Äôs mom. Alice was in college when Lorna died, and we were all disguised at the funeral since it was closed to celebrities and kept small considering everything. We were surprised Alice took the position at SHIELD as quickly as she did after Norma died. I‚Äôm sure I did meet Rio when she was a kid, the way those two were inseparable, but I don‚Äôt quite remember,‚Äù Agatha lied, the explanation was for Jen‚Äôs benefit as Nat and Wanda had been there at the time. Lorna had been a mentor and confidant for Agatha and was in their inner circle at the time.¬† Agatha would never forget the look on Rio‚Äôs face those two times they had accidentally run into each other two decades ago, but no one needed to know that. It had been entertaining, but she hadn‚Äôt been able to find much amusement in it for long. Agatha had been there out of concern for Lorna and her own need to speak to her urgently. ‚ÄúObviously, I wasn‚Äôt paying attention. That would be weird.‚Äù She replied.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice had been twenty-two when her mother died from an overdose at an Oscars after-party. Norma died three years later.
    </p>
<p>
     When Alice started teaching at SHIELD, everyone was surprised she wanted anything to do with Hollywood, especially given how insistent Lorna had been on keeping Alice away from it and then what had happened.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda shrugged. ‚ÄúStill, you need to talk to her more, get to know her, ask her out‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚Äú...Date her, get married, have babies.‚Äù Nat finished with a sly smile.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, not you too!‚Äù Agatha gave an exasperated sigh. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing! I was just, caught off-guard! That‚Äôs all! I need harder liquor for this.‚Äù She said as she got up and marched to the bar area beside the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúJust keep it out of the tabloids and away from the paparazzi, will you? I‚Äôm trying to generate award buzz for you two and am in negotiations for your next roles. I don‚Äôt need to be cleaning up after you screwing your son‚Äôs science teacher after last year's debacle.‚Äù Jen said, scrolling socials and media websites to make sure current chatter was all positive.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha decided it was better to get water instead of continuing to drink as she returned to the living room and sat on the couch, leaning against Wanda. ‚ÄúThe only people I‚Äôm screwing are random models and people I meet that sign an NDA.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda and Nat both rolled their eyes and sighed as Jen smirked and raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my hoe,‚Äù Jen grunted as Nat elbowed her hard in the side. Agatha chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúBesides, Alice is family, and it‚Äôs just a matter of time before Rio starts spending time with us. I‚Äôm not going to sleep with a member of our little coven. No one else is pulling that trigger.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     All eyes landed on Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhoa, why is everyone looking at me?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs been ten years and neither of you have made a move,‚Äù Wanda sighed.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen shook her head. ‚ÄúWe are not talking about me right now, this is about Agatha. Let‚Äôs go back to making fun of her, please.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     In all honesty, Agatha knew that she would find an excuse to run into Rio the next time she was up at SHIELD. She suddenly was only interested in Nicky‚Äôs science class for the upcoming year.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat on her couch, eating the stir-fry she had made for both of them, as Alice turned off the episode of
     <em>
      The Drew Barrymore Show
     </em>
     they had recorded. ‚ÄúThey are both going to be nominated for that Oscar, I bet Agatha wins it,‚Äù Rio said as she turned the music on for background noise, Freddie Mercury‚Äôs voice filling the air. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt even seen the movie, but judging by the song and everything that‚Äôs been said about it, I‚Äôm just going with it.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOoh, maybe she‚Äôll take you to the Oscars as her date!‚Äù Alice grinned ear-to-ear.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smacked her arm. ‚ÄúStop it. She and Wanda will probably go together since they‚Äôll both be nominated.‚Äù Rio ate the last bite of her dinner and took both of their bowls to the kitchen to put in the dishwasher and clean up. Rio typically inhaled her food and would wait until Alice was mostly done with hers before she started eating. ‚ÄúPlus, she is not into me. I‚Äôm sixteen years younger than she is, remember? Her son fits in that age gap. I‚Äôve almost had Raven as long as that age gap. I have pants as old as that age gap.‚Äù She just shook her head as she put leftovers in a container for lunch the next day.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice rolled her eyes as her best friend returned and settled opposite her on the couch. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre smitten. You‚Äôve been obsessed with her forever. The few times she was at Gran‚Äôs growing up, you nearly combusted.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a difference between being obsessed with a celebrity and meeting them as a normal parent of one of your students. Besides, that was almost twenty years ago, I was a child, and it happened twice at Gran‚Äôs when we were teenagers. I thought Agatha was sleeping with your mom.‚Äù Rio recalled.
    </p>
<p>
     Lorna rarely came to Gran‚Äôs, trying her best to keep Alice away from Hollywood. She didn‚Äôt want Alice to fall into the life that had consumed her. Every time Lorna came home, it was in an attempt to get clean. Every time, she eventually relapsed, but she would try. Agatha came to visit her twice. They were on a TV show together then.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThen there was the funeral, when she and Wanda were disguised, and Agatha pulled you aside,‚Äù Rio added solemnly.¬† When Lorna died, it was right after she had won an Oscar with Agatha for the song from The Witches Road, as well as Best Supporting Actress, and Best Feature Film. She had won three Oscars that night, and hours later, she overdosed and died.
    </p>
<p>
     Lorna had co-starred with Agatha in
     <em>
      The Witches Road,
     </em>
     and the movie had consumed her. It was an instant classic, shooting to the top ten of all the best movie lists. However, it was a dark movie and it had been said that Lorna couldn‚Äôt handle the subject matter.
    </p>
<p>
     Gran had been furious and held a very small funeral, keeping it closed to celebrities and anyone else from Hollywood.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda, Agatha, Nat, and a few other co-stars from that movie had snuck in. Agatha had pulled Alice aside and talked to her, slipping her information for a therapist, lawyers in case she needed them, and Lilia Calderu‚Äôs information for after graduation.
    </p>
<p>
     Lorna had always bragged about how Alice was going to be a teacher and influence the lives of children and have a lasting impact.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice had been bitter, but when Gran died, she finally called Lilia Calderu and applied to SHIELD.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice‚Äôs voice broke through the memories. ‚ÄúI remember!‚Äù She laughed. ‚ÄúI had to remind you how straight my mother was.‚Äù Which was true. She was a huge ally, but Lorna had been married multiple times to famous men. One marriage lasted only 28 hours, and she had zero romantic interest in women-something Lorna once called a tragedy.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head and smiled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still weird knowing that you‚Äôre technically Hollywood royalty, but I get surprised when I see you call these people by their first names or act so friendly with them. I‚Äôm still shocked that you‚Äôre friends with Agatha and Wanda.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The other woman shrugged. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt grow up in it. We usually weren't whenever Mom and her famous friends were at home. The few times we were, it was just as shocking to me as it was to you. I wasn‚Äôt close to these people. I know them now, and you will too. With this particular group of women, they‚Äôre my family, I was just bound by NDAs and couldn't say anything.‚Äù Alice looked at Rio before her eyes lit up. ‚ÄúHopefully you‚Äôll get really close to Agatha,‚Äù she added as she put her arms up to shield her face in case Rio smacked her with a pillow or anything else. They had had their share of pillow fights, and stuffed animal fights, Rio had used the occasional chancla, whatever was handy, growing up. They were millennials. It‚Äôs how they showed affection.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio just groaned. ‚ÄúNo. Could you imagine? I‚Äôd have her fans try to murder me, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù She thought about what Alice had said about being kept out of the spotlight, and she was right. She spent more time at Alice‚Äôs than at her own home as a kid and had her own room there by the time she was fourteen. It was a haven for her. Her parents hadn‚Äôt been great, and they never noticed when she wasn‚Äôt home either. When they died, she was a senior in high school, and Gran legally became her guardian, even though she technically already had been. Alice truly was the only family she had. Gran would usually send the girls away when Lorna would come home, not wanting them to see the detox process. She had been such a good mother to the girls. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not into me, and I don‚Äôt date parents of students,‚Äù Rio added.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice just shrugged. ‚ÄúWhatever you say, Captain Oblivious.‚Äù
    </p>

<em>
<span>
       Early August
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     It was Friday, and there was still another week before school started. Rio had been trying to put that meeting in the back of her memories, but it kept replaying in her thoughts. She was sitting at her desk, working on her About Me and Meet the Teacher slideshow with Fletcher playing in the background. Rio was absolutely NOT picturing Agatha Harkness‚Äôs smile when there was a knock on her open classroom door. She looked up, expecting to see a coworker. Instead, standing in front of her was Agatha Harkness, as if Rio had summoned the global megastar with her mind. Agatha‚Äôs hair was down in soft waves down to her elbows. She wore a purple, sleeveless, button-up blouse, with high-waisted black shorts. Black sandals completed the outfit. She looked amazing and had that dazzling smile. Rio could‚Äôve sworn she was dreaming and subtly pinched her leg under her desk. It hurt. Not dreaming.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHi Rio, am I catching you at a bad time?‚Äù Agatha asked, having stepped slightly into the brightly lit classroom.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared for a moment before she remembered how to blink. Where was Alice? Wanda? Nat? A fucking mouse? Literally, anyone or anything would be helpful right now.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, no, just preparing some things for next week. How can I help you, Ms. Ha..‚Äù She faltered for a moment, ‚ÄúAgatha?‚Äù She smiled as she stood up and walked around her desk to meet in the middle, sitting on top of one of the student desks, painfully aware of the black basketball shorts and Pink Pony Club tank top she was wearing with a sports bra. Her hair was up in another messy bun, escaped strands falling around her face, and she had ditched her shoes an hour or so ago. Parents weren‚Äôt supposed to be in the building today, but Alice had warned her that Agatha was allowed to do basically whatever she wanted.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sat on a desk close to Rio, and they turned to face each other, an empty desk between them.
     <em>
      Great Agatha, now you have to come up with a reason as to why you‚Äôre here.
     </em>
     ‚ÄúNicky has football practice,‚Äù
     <em>
      Okay, not a lie,
     </em>
     ‚Äúso I thought I‚Äôd see which teachers were here to go ahead and see who would be signing up to do concession stand duty at games and maybe get supply lists. Everything I‚Äôve been working on is currently in post, and all of my press and such is around here, so I have some time on my hands to be pretty involved, which is what I prefer.‚Äù
     <em>
      Okay, that sounded somewhat believable.
     </em>
     She thought to herself.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou go school shopping with Nicky?‚Äù She asked. Did mega-celebrities actually do that? She wondered.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDepending on my schedule at this point of the year, yes. I really try to be as hands-on as I possibly can.‚Äù Agatha reiterated. ‚ÄúSame with working concessions at football games and track meets. I‚Äôve seen firsthand what happens when people get caught up more in fame and leave their children to be raised by others. I swore I wouldn't do that when I had Nicky, and Wanda did the same with the boys. So here we are, our little chosen family, doing what we can to give them as much of a normal life as possible.‚Äù She explained. Why was she explaining this all to a stranger? She didn‚Äôt know. There was just something about Rio that made her want to tell her everything. She was so easy to talk to, and that was dangerous.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. Alice was somewhat a product of what Agatha was talking about, and Rio wondered if she was one of the children she was talking about, but she let it slide. ‚ÄúAll of that information will be readily available on Tuesday at Open House.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      What the fuck Vidal?
     </em>
     She immediately thought to herself.
     <em>
      That is Agatha Fucking Harkness and you‚Äôre thinking about rules? Give her the goddamn list! You already emailed her the syllabus! Hell, give her the answers to the first test if she asks!
     </em>
     She shook the thoughts from her head.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI mean, I‚Äôm sure you want to get a head start this weekend. Let me print out a copy of what Nicky needs specifically for class.‚Äù She replied, trying to breathe normally, walking back to her desk.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha‚Äôs smile brightened if that was even possible.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThank you. He‚Äôs still at the age where it‚Äôs fun to drag him out and embarrass him.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio noticed that Agatha had followed her to her desk and was leaning against it, very close to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm sure it is. Alice and I embarrassed ourselves plenty. We didn‚Äôt need adults around to help.‚Äù She smiled up at Agatha, clicking around the desktop for the files she needed and tapping her foot slightly to the beat of the current song, trying to act natural when she realized her music had changed to a very not safe for work playlist.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs face went bright red as the lyrics rang out, ‚ÄúGet into my bed, girls just want to have sex.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scrambled to find the music player and turn it off. ‚ÄúLike right now,‚Äù she mumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. ‚ÄúI love that playlist, though I‚Äôm partial to ‚ÄòShe Calls Me Daddy‚Äô and ‚ÄòMommy Issues.‚Äô‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio choked on her saliva.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. Where was everyone now? She still had it. She was smooth, no tripping up for this dyke. The other day was a total fluke. Except Rio was still coughing and turning blue. Agatha looked around for the required teacher tumbler and grabbed the green metal water cup with random stickers.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knelt down and put the straw to Rio‚Äôs lips. Rio sucked down water and Agatha looked down at the tile floor. Agatha proving to herself that she could flirt harmlessly had made Rio choke.
    </p>
<p>
     That was not the kind of choking Agatha enjoyed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs coughing subsided, her eyes watery. ‚ÄúThank you, I don‚Äôt know what happened.‚Äù She laughed nervously.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSomeone made inappropriate jokes, and you choked. I think I saw them run out of the door.‚Äù Agatha pointed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio poked her tongue in her cheek, realizing how close they had come to each other. She backed up and stood, pressing the print button. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get you those documents, shall we?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda had lost Agatha, at SHIELD of all places.
    </p>
<p>
     They were on a specific mission to get the finalized new parent list from the front office. Wanda had stepped into the principal‚Äôs office, while the other three women waited for the list.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI just need to ask Lilia a quick question about this weekend is all,‚Äù Wanda had said, before slipping into the office. She knew Agatha wouldn‚Äôt follow. Agatha spent enough time in Lilia‚Äôs office, with as much as Nicky and Tommy got into trouble during the year, always the one to smooth things over. She didn‚Äôt want to spend more time there than she had to.
    </p>
<p>
     So technically, Wanda didn‚Äôt lose Agatha, Nat, and Jen did.
    </p>
<p>
     How had three women, lost ONE award-winning actress?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda had replayed the events of the past few days for Lilia Calderu and made sure to emphasize Agatha‚Äôs insistence that she was not attracted to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia emitted a throaty laugh, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time Agatha finds someone who can truly understand her and meet her where she‚Äôs at.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Wanda tilted her head in question.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRio has a past too, they would be good for each other,‚Äù Lilia shrugged. Wanda had known Lilia since she had landed in Los Angeles all those years before and Lilia still baffled her.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia turned her eyes to the door, a gleam in her eye and a knowing smile playing at the corners of her lips. ‚ÄúYou better go find Agatha.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs right outside the door with Jen and Nat.‚Äù Wanda furrowed her eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Lilia was a fixture at SHIELD, with many joking that she came with the building. She had secured a position right out of college and had risen to principal. She knew everything about everyone and was incredibly insightful. Many alumni, or just those who knew her, were convinced she could tell the future.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIs she?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Nat and Jen rushed through the door.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe lost Agatha,‚Äù Nat said first.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhich normally wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Jen trailed off.
    </p>
<p>
     The three women turned their heads to Lilia as she huffed a laugh and waved a hand, dismissing them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They left the office, Wanda in the lead. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go to Alice‚Äôs classroom first, see if she‚Äôs seen her. Then we‚Äôll head to Rio‚Äôs,‚Äù she instructed.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda would normally not be concerned. However, Agatha had been right that this was Alice‚Äôs best friend and someone who would inevitably spend more time with all of them.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda had a plan, and she was not going to let Agatha‚Äôs abnormally high sex drive mess it up.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen snickered. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt one or both of you make a cheesy high school movie like this? You know, back when Agatha was young?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not old now, and those were generally slasher flicks with a killer chasing us.‚Äù They turned down a hall as she looked at Nat. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you supposed to know where we are,
     <em>
      body
     </em>
     guard?‚Äù A sly smile tugged at Wanda‚Äôs lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat glanced at Wanda as they arrived at¬† Alice‚Äôs classroom. ‚ÄúPhone tracking says she‚Äôs in the building. The building with more security than Fort Knox, I think she‚Äôll be okay.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They walked into the familiar classroom decorated with an assortment of history, motivational, and pop-culture posters. Bookshelves around the room held the expected books and supplies as well an array of student projects from over the years, gifts from previous students, and various personal touches. Stevie Nicks came through the overhead speaker, and standing precariously on a chair, placed on top of a table, was Alice, attempting to put shades over the fluorescent lights to make the lighting less harsh.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAlice,‚Äù Wanda said as she walked in, scanning the room, ‚Äúhave you seen Agatha?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Alice turned quickly as if she had forgotten her current situation. The chair toppled, and Alice came tumbling from her makeshift tower. Nat and Jen rushed forward to keep her from being seriously injured. Jen, having the longer stride as the taller of the two, caught Alice around the waist.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Alice said, blushing, as Jen helped her to the ground the rest of the way. They quickly parted as Jen mumbled that it was nothing and looked at the ground. Nat and Wanda exchanged understanding and knowing looks.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúUh, yeah, she stopped by to ask where Rio‚Äôs room is,‚Äù Alice fidgeted with her clothing ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt really touched base with any of you. Is Agatha into Rio?‚Äù She would add that moment with Jen to the pile of other moments with Jen. They had collected a decade of them and hadn‚Äôt done anything about it yet. What was another few decades?
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda turned, gesturing for Alice to lead the way as they headed to Rio‚Äôs room. Being in charge was something Wanda was trying to do more often, and she found it thrilling.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúShe lies and says she‚Äôs not, that Rio‚Äôs too young and she doesn‚Äôt want a repeat of what happened before.‚Äù She explained to the younger woman as they walked down the hall.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice sighed. ‚ÄúRio has a rule about not dating her students‚Äô parents, but I know her.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen let out a sigh of relief, ‚ÄúGreat, so we leave them alone, let them live their lives, and my job is easier.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The other women stopped right at Rio‚Äôs door and looked back at Jen as they whispered, ‚ÄúNot a chance.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs skin had just returned to its natural olive state and had just handed Agatha the supply list, her school contact information, and a hard copy of the syllabus when everyone else walked in.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThere you are, Aggie!‚Äù Wanda said with a radiant smile. It looked mischievous to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Alice with a raised eyebrow but didn‚Äôt say anything. Agatha turned toward the four intruders. ‚ÄúI had just come down here to get more information about Nicky‚Äôs science class,‚Äù she explained.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jennifer raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúOf course you did.‚Äù She turned towards Rio and extended her hand. ‚ÄúJennifer Kale, I keep these two employed and in line. I also clean up after their son‚Äôs shenanigans. You can call me Jen.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio shook her hand and returned her smile. ‚ÄúRio Vidal. Science. I will try to keep an eye on Nicky and Tommy. I hear Billy stays out of trouble.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen nodded. ‚ÄúYes, that one took after Vision and the young Wanda. Not the two standing before you, thankfully.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda rolled her eyes and looked back at Rio. ‚ÄúDid Agatha tell you about tomorrow?‚Äù She asked, feigning innocence.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow in question. ‚ÄúWhat about tomorrow?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you, Aggie!‚Äù Wanda smiled warmly. ‚ÄúEvery year, we host a huge party for the teachers and parents at our beach house. We have a pool and a private beach area. We have a lot of fun, and it‚Äôs a casual way to meet the parents, with no students present, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about being in a swimsuit or drinking with kids around.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe can be pretty laid back here, it‚Äôs just the general nature of the school and environment. We try to host things when we can, volunteer, chaperone, those kinds of things,‚Äù Wanda gestured with her hand as if to indicate other events. ‚ÄúTony Stark tends to host several things for the larger Hollywood community, often involving the kids, and we do things for the teachers and the school.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAll the teachers are there, and Calderu comes. I‚Äôm surprised Alice hasn‚Äôt mentioned it yet. Anyway, it starts around seven, and Alice knows where the house is. We‚Äôd love to have you.‚Äù At some point in her very excited explanation, Wanda had put her hand on Rio‚Äôs arm, and Agatha had turned bright red with a murderous expression.
    </p>
<p>
     The other three women had moved off to the back of the room and were talking in hushed, suspicious tones.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúPlease come,‚Äù Wanda added, looking at Rio with big green eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn‚Äôt possibly tell this woman no. She glanced back at Alice, who had suddenly appeared back at her side. ‚ÄúIf Alice usually goes, then I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be there. That sounds like a great way to meet people in a less stressful environment.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Alice nodded, and for some reason, there were butterflies in Rio‚Äôs stomach at the thought of being at a party at Agatha‚Äôs beach house in swimwear. Rio glanced at Agatha and caught her eye. Agatha smiled slightly at Rio before turning away and returning to her more nonchalant expression.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda beamed. ‚ÄúGreat! We‚Äôll see you tomorrow! We‚Äôve got to go get the boys from practice.‚Äù Wanda grabbed Agatha‚Äôs arm, and they left with their small entourage following behind them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWell, that was‚Ä¶something,‚Äù Rio said after a moment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to go home. Are you ready to go home? Let‚Äôs go home.‚Äù Without waiting for Alice, Rio started gathering her things and turned off the computer. ‚ÄúWait, where‚Äôs my phone?‚Äù She asked, looking around the room.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Alice held it up. ‚ÄúFound it! It was on a desk.‚Äù In reality, Alice had grabbed it while Rio had been distracted by Wanda so that she, Jennifer, and Nat could program everyone‚Äôs numbers into it. Nat had pick-pocketed Agatha‚Äôs phone and programmed Rio‚Äôs number into it.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAnd yes, I‚Äôm ready to go home. I can‚Äôt believe I forgot to tell you about the party.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha found herself, once again, sitting in her living room, wine in hand, talking about Rio Vidal, the woman who was becoming a recurring theme in her thoughts and topic of conversation.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you didn‚Äôt tell her about the party tomorrow!‚Äù Wanda exclaimed from her usual seat in the corner of the couch.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha just rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúAlice always comes, I just assumed Rio would come with her.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Nat laughed. ‚ÄúSure you did, or you were afraid to invite the pretty girl to your party and see her in a swimsuit.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha took a drink and swallowed before replying. ‚ÄúI am a grown woman. We had a nice conversation today, and for the last time, I am not attracted to her.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda just smirked and said, ‚ÄúWell, I for one think the blue shirt she wore today really brought out the green of her eyes.‚Äù She glanced at Nat and Jen to make sure they were listening for Agatha‚Äôs response.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Automatically, Agatha replied, ‚ÄúHer eyes are a beautiful light brown, amber if they catch the light just right, and she was wearing a black Pink Pony Club tank top since school hasn‚Äôt started.‚Äù After it was out of her mouth, she realized what had happened as her friends laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just very observant, okay?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make my job harder,‚Äù Jen groaned.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned back into the couch. Rio was enchanting, and Agatha believed there was nothing wrong with innocent flirting. She would not, however, go beyond that.
    </p>
<p>
     No more sleeping with teachers.

<p>
     Rio was going to a party at Agatha Harkness‚Äôs beach house.
    </p>
<p>
     Yes, it was for all of the faculty, staff, and parents at SHIELD, but the fact remained that Rio would be at a star-studded party at a beach house owned by Agatha Fucking Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     After leaving school on Friday, Rio had decided she needed a new swimsuit specifically for the occasion. Alice, unsurprisingly, had jumped at the idea. Saturday morning was spent getting pedicures, something they hadn‚Äôt done together in years. While Rio hadn‚Äôt lost touch with Alice, they had grown apart, not being able to discuss much with Alice‚Äôs position being what it was. Rio felt as if she was getting to know a new version of Alice, really getting to know her. Whenever they got together for holidays or breaks, they mainly discussed Rio and her drama. Rio‚Äôs school hadn‚Äôt required NDAs, although she had a few semi-famous friends who personally required them.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio still told Alice everything, NDA or not.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice however, refused to break laws. She was far more of a stickler in that regard.
    </p>
<p>
     They were very different in that way, and Rio respected that, though she didn‚Äôt like the secrets and lies. Still, it was Alice, and Rio respected her deeply held beliefs of her universally distributed sister. They both had trauma and it manifested in different ways and came with it‚Äôs own responses. Rio didn‚Äôt like lies and secrets due to her previous relationship, and Alice was very adverse to breaking contracts, laws, and unspoken agreements, due to her mother breaking the unspoken bond and agreement of motherhood.
    </p>
<p>
     It was something Alice and Rio had discussed at length.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio brought herself back to the moment, checking over herself for what must have been the fiftieth time in the floor-length mirror. The royal blue bikini she had chosen complemented her tan skin and made the gold flecks in her brown eyes stand out just right. She pulled on denim cutoffs and a black tank top, letting her collarbone-length dark hair stay down for now. She had packed a bag in order to be proactive. Alice had informed that it wasn‚Äôt unusual for people to stay at the house for the night, though Agatha and Wanda would usually have their drivers take them home. Wagatha believed in safety and was adamant that people stay if needed. Rio planned for them to come home or get an Uber, but generally kept a go-bag in her car as a habit from childhood and just freshened it up for the night. Like the scouts, Rio was always prepared.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhy do I feel like a teenager going to her first major party, Raven?‚Äù Rio asked her cat, who was observing her from her spot on the bed. Raven let out a meow in reply.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, not you too. I think the two of us could be good friends, and that‚Äôs it.‚Äù She looked at the green-eyed cat that was giving her a look. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at me like that. Maybe you‚Äôll meet her one day‚Äîjust friends. Stop judging me like that. Besides, it‚Äôs just you and me. Well, and Alice. The last time I tried to date turned out disastrous. You never liked her, I should‚Äôve listened.‚Äù She shook her head as she heard Alice come in.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAre you ready? Are you having deep conversations with Raven?‚Äù She asked as she walked into the bedroom and scratched the cat under the chin. ‚ÄúI swear this cat is going to live forever.‚Äù She turned and looked at Raven. ‚ÄúYou better, at least.‚Äù She looked back at Rio, ‚ÄúYou look amazing! Agatha is going to die.‚Äù She added as Raven added a meow of agreement.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúAgain, no. I bought this for me, no matter what you say. You look amazing, that orange was a good choice.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Alice wore an orange bikini, black board shorts, and a blue tank top. Her black and red hair was pulled back in a ponytail and flip-flops adorned her feet. ‚ÄúLet me just grab my bag, and I‚Äôll be ready to go. Raven‚Äôs been fed.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Ten minutes later, they were on their way to the beach, bags safely in the back, and the lyrics of ‚ÄòFeminomenon‚Äô filling the car. Rio wasn‚Äôt entirely sure why she was so nervous. It was just a massive party at Agatha Harkness and Wanda Maximoff‚Äôs beach house.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThey do this every year?‚Äù Rio asked, turning to Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYes, like Wanda said, they do all the things if they can. They are the super moms. Drew loves to do things at the elementary and middle school levels, and Tony Stark loves a good party. It just depends on the occasion. SHIELD does quite a few of events, but independent activities like this? Wagatha is usually behind it if their schedule allows.‚Äù Alice answered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head in disbelief, ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs amazing, but wow. That‚Äôs a lot.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThey love it. Especially Wanda. Agatha just goes along with it.‚Äù Alice added.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI would not do those things for you.‚Äù Rio laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, you would absolutely throw random parties for me, just not school parties.‚Äù Alice agreed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked out the windshield as they headed towards Malibu. ‚ÄúWhy, though? They‚Äôre these huge megastars. Yes, back-to-school parties happen, but why would they do something like this, especially just for the teachers and other parents and then go over the top for other things?‚Äù She looked at Alice who was focused on the road.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice thought about it for a moment. ‚ÄúYou know the basic Agatha Harkness back story.‚Äù She stated.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOkay, recap it.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Alice out of the side of her eyes but did as requested. ‚ÄúAgatha‚Äôs mom put her in a beauty pageant when Agatha was a baby in October 1973 at six months old, and she instantly went into commercials and then was cast in a TV show at the age of one. Boom, instant child star.‚Äù Rio started to recap. ‚ÄúShe was cast in movies at five, and her super crazy religious mother tried to control her, no freedoms, private tutors, etc., despite the fact that she was the one who had introduced her child to Hollywood.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHer mom kept her as sheltered as she could, and Agatha rebelled and was friends with all the other child stars of the time.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHer mom, Evanora, was very abusive and caught Agatha making out with another star of the time, and outed her, thinking it would ruin Agatha, and it didn‚Äôt.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThe crazy bitch then tried to shoot her in public in the eighties and missed. Agatha filed to be emancipated from her mother at sixteen and won, becoming America‚Äôs lesbian sweetheart in 1989. She went on to get her high school degree that year and graduated from college, but never had an actual school, childhood, or parental experience.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThen, Wanda was dumped in Hollywood in 1994 after her family was killed in the war in Sokovia, and Agatha took her under her wing. Something about Wanda‚Äôs aunt was a producer on Agatha's new show, and they cast Wanda as the younger sister.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSo far, yes. It was Sisters, by the way. I love that show.‚Äù Alice chimed in.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe can quote that show,‚Äù Rio replied. They still watched it, even if it was nearly 30 years old. Rio and Alice watched it as a comfort show, even though it had ended in 2001.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSo Agatha took Wanda under her wing, and in 1995, things with the aunt went south, and Agatha basically took her in like a sister, and we see where that ended up,‚Äù Rio concluded.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice nodded her head. Those were all the basics Rio needed to know for now. Alice knew a few additional details more, but Agatha always seemed to provide more details when Alice thought she had known all there was to know. And Lilia mainly told Alice things about Alice‚Äôs mother.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could fill in any more nitty-gritty details from there when she was ready. That could be part of their bonding and eventual love story. Alice knew Rio had her own nitty-gritty back story to share with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRight. They met Nat in 1997, that‚Äôs not my story to share, though. They, like us, are a found family with many traditions. We‚Äôre all phoenixes. Jen and Lilia even fit into the puzzle along the way, and so did I. We were all covenless witches at one point, and Agatha refers to the group as the coven, we all do.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAgatha and Wanda wanted to make sure their kids had great memories and wanted to give back to the places they found homes in.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio took in her friend's words and looked at her for a long moment. ‚ÄúYou really have kept so much from me,‚Äù she stated, pieces of a puzzle falling into place. Alice shrugged ‚ÄúI signed several NDAs, and they were covered under that umbrella, Rio. My hands were tied.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked down at her lap. This was Alice, the only family she had left. She couldn‚Äôt be mad at her. Not really. She understood, it just hurt. She had told Alice everything about her friends in San Francisco and Rio had also signed an NDA.
    </p>
<p>
     She pushed that all aside, determined not to ruin the night.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúTell me about Jen,‚Äù Rio changed the subject with a knowing smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice‚Äôs cheeks pinkened as she seemed to focus even more on the road, if it was even possible. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? She‚Äôs a friend.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI saw how you looked at her yesterday.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Alice shook her head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing, we‚Äôre just friends. We both moved out here about the same time, and I wouldn‚Äôt want to lose that friendship.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. ‚ÄúOh good, because she‚Äôs really cute and I was thinking I would ‚Äî‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say you could make a move.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought.‚Äù Rio picked a new song to play, and they drove the last few minutes in a comfortable silence.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
     Everything was perfectly set up: the food, the bar, and the music. Agatha was wearing a simple black high-waisted two-piece with a white open-front cover-up monogrammed with a purple monogrammed A.H.. Wanda stood beside her in a black and white one-piece and a matching cover-up with a scarlet monogrammed W.M.
    </p>
<p>
     They were never beating those couple of allegations.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRelax, Alice texted me. They‚Äôre on their way.‚Äù Wanda put a comforting hand on Agatha‚Äôs arm, noticing how tense her best friend was.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you mean,‚Äù Agatha replied, her shoulders automatically relaxing.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSure you don‚Äôt.‚Äù Wanda teased.
    </p>
<p>
     Natasha stepped up next to them wearing a black tank top and shorts with a red one-piece underneath. She was on duty, as evidenced by her earpiece, but the swimsuit made sense. ‚ÄúMaking a move tonight, Aggie?‚Äù She said with a slight smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all terrible friends,‚Äù Agatha pouted as Jen joined the group in her pink swim shorts and halter top.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThis event is too public for you to do anything anyway.‚Äù Jen nodded in agreement.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda‚Äôs shoulders sagged. ‚ÄúMust you take the fun out of everything, Jen?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs eyes widened as they drove through the gate and up to the Malibu beach house. Alice ignored the man who directed her where to park and chose a place of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúJust leave your bag here and bring your phone for now,‚Äù Alice instructed with a smile as she climbed down from her Jeep.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked up at the massive beach house that was more like a beach mansion.
    </p>
<p>
     She followed Alice up the few steps to the double doors, and they walked straight into the open-concept house, seeing straight to the back of the house, which was entirely glass.
    </p>
<p>
     The back doors were open, leading out to where the pool was, and beyond that, a path led to the beach. Rio‚Äôs eyes landed automatically on Agatha, who was talking to Coach Rogers. She was headed towards her when someone grabbed her arm and spun her around. Rio found herself face to face with her boss, Lilia Calderu, wearing a classy one-piece with a wrap-around skirt.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRio, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here. This is the perfect time to get to know the parents, especially some of the very well-known, award-winning ones. Have a lovely time.‚Äù Lilia smiled at her warmly and slipped back into the growing crowd. Rio stared at the spot where she had been with a baffled look on her face as Alice took her arm.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRemember, the woman knows more than we do and speaks in riddles.‚Äù Alice handed her a drink. ‚ÄúHere, now go talk.‚Äù Rio nodded and turned to where Agatha had been prior. She wasn‚Äôt sure why that was the first person she wanted to talk to, Rio just felt drawn to the older woman. Instead, she found herself in conversation with Pepper Potts-Stark and Drew Barrymore.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you came, I was telling Agatha about you when we were filming the other day,‚Äù Drew had a hand on Rio‚Äôs arm, drawing circles on it with her thumb.
    </p>
<p>
     Pepper had an eyebrow raised and a smirk on her face. As a waiter walked by, she took Rio‚Äôs empty drink from her and replaced it with a full one.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at the older blonde woman thankfully. She had a feeling that she and Pepper would be good friends.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh? About what exactly?‚Äù Rio managed to get out. Why was Drew Barrymore having a conversation about her?
    </p>
<p>
     Drew smiled widely. ‚ÄúI had read about you in the welcome back email and told our dear Aggie that she needed to brush up on her science is all,‚Äù she said with a wink.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was going to melt. Drew Barrymore was trying to set her up with Agatha Harkness. LA truly was lesbian heaven.
    </p>
<p>
     Pepper put a hand on Drew‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúDrew, you‚Äôre going to cause her to short-circuit.‚Äù Pepper laughed and changed the subject. ‚ÄúAlice has told us great things about you. I‚Äôm sure Morgan will love your class.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     They chatted a little longer before Rio stepped away, their numbers added to her phone. She didn‚Äôt need Drew‚Äôs number necessarily, however, Drew insisted.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio smiled and blew air out of her nose with a small smile upon seeing Agatha‚Äôs number with a purple heart next to it.
     <em>
      Devils,
     </em>
     she thought.
    </p>
<p>
     The inside of the house was becoming rather crowded, and the sun was beginning to set outside. Rio took that as a sign and excused herself from the group of English teachers she was speaking to. Rio found English teachers to be the most dramatic group on any campus, and this group was already living up to that reputation. Rio slipped out the back door, picked up her third drink of the night, walked past the pool, and down the stairs and the short path to the private beach, surprised that it was empty.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat in one of the beach chairs in the sand and took in the relative quiet, the muted sounds of the party behind her and the waves in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio removed her sandals, set them to the side, and let her toes dig into the sand. She leaned back and took in the pink and orange hues of the sunset, the light breeze slipped over her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a beautiful view and something she hoped she would get to do again.
     <em>
      Maybe next year,
     </em>
     she thought.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been another beach house once, but it hadn‚Äôt been nearly as peaceful. This was peaceful, and comforting, a place that spoke of family and memories.
    </p>
<p>
     She was lost in her thoughts and the scenery when she heard the unmistakable and familiar voice of Agatha Harkness behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always said the sunset is the universe‚Äôs way of celebrating lesbianism,‚Äù Agatha said as she sat down in the chair next to Rio, drink in hand. ‚ÄúIs it okay if I join you? I can leave if you want to continue enjoying the peace and Mother Nature‚Äôs lesbianism. I know the party gets pretty crowded and overwhelming.‚Äù She added.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your house, pretty sure you‚Äôre allowed to sit where you want. Thank you for asking and not assuming though. Very polite of you.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI have been told I‚Äôm rather polite for Hollywood elite.‚Äù She retorted.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get ahead of yourself there, Harkness. Don‚Äôt want to inflate your ego too much.‚Äù Rio was shocked at herself. Apparently, all it took was three incredibly strong drinks and she could banter back and forth with Agatha Fucking Harkness.
     <em>
      Wonder if I can drink at work,
     </em>
     she considered.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI think the awards have already done that job.‚Äù She laughed and snorted, causing her to turn bright red.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled reflexively upon hearing Agatha‚Äôs snort. It was something that she had always found charming about the actress in interviews and her acting. It was something that seemed genuine. ‚ÄúI love your laugh. That snort is adorable.‚Äù
     <em>
      Fuck, Vidal,
     </em>
     she thought as a blush spread across her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     The two women sat there in embarrassed silence without looking at each other.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was the first to break the silence between them. ‚ÄúDo you spend time here often? The sunset is beautiful here. Everything is really.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a drink and nodded. ‚ÄúIt depends on our schedules and life. We begin and end our summer here and try to spend time here during the summer. Girls‚Äô weekends when we can, it‚Äôs a nice little getaway. We also have Wanda‚Äôs cabin in Lake Tahoe, and our apartment in New York. The New York apartment doubles for work, of course.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs taking U-Hauling to a new level.‚Äù Rio immediately slapped a hand over her mouth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go drown myself in the ocean.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed and snorted again, before groaning. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll join you.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not completely wrong, though. It does look like that. Wanda is my family. When we found each other, it became an older-younger sibling situation. It made sense to buy property together and share it that way. We didn‚Äôt both need our own. Our houses are even on a compound of sorts. I‚Äôm sure Alice told you.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Agatha, mouth slightly agape. Agatha and Wanda lived on the same piece of land, too? ‚ÄúShe most certainly did not! I just found out she knew you both this week.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. ‚ÄúRight, NDAs.‚Äù Agatha ran her hand through her elbow-length hair. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs public knowledge that we‚Äôre neighbors. What‚Äôs not as commonly known is that it‚Äôs actually a very large enclosed piece of land. Her house is on one side, mine is on the other, and the original house is in the middle. The boys now hang out in that middle house, we call it the Clubhouse. We have driveways that connect them. There are what goes for woods in LA, towards the back, and space to build more houses if we wanted to. I bought the land when I turned eighteen, back when there was still a lot of land on what was the outskirts of LA at the time. Now there‚Äôs a housing development across the street.‚Äù She laughed before continuing, ‚ÄúNat lives next to us, even though she could live on the property if she weren‚Äôt so hardheaded.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWith us being so close, Wanda and I are somewhat codependent, and we realize that. It‚Äôs not in a toxic way, more in the way that we‚Äôve experienced trauma, and we‚Äôre each other‚Äôs security blankets. Obviously, we can go places without each other. We‚Äôre not that bad. But knowing that your sister is right there unless she‚Äôs off filming somewhere? It‚Äôs priceless. I imagine it‚Äôs the same for you and Alice from what she has said?‚Äù Agatha was looking directly at Rio, waiting for her response.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. She had never expected to have such an easy conversation with this woman. ‚ÄúYes. She‚Äôs all I have, family-wise. We‚Äôve lived together before, and we used to be extremely close. Being in different cities for so long was excruciating, and with the confidentiality, we didn‚Äôt know everything about each other anymore. So being neighbors and working together again has already been amazing.‚Äù Rio enjoyed talking to Agatha. It was as if this weren‚Äôt their third actual conversation, ever.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha‚Äôs smile softened. ‚ÄúI know keeping things from those you love can be extremely difficult. We share so much, especially since we are very much one big family. We share the private jets. We got to a point where we couldn‚Äôt fly commercially a long time ago. The security team, styling team, domestic teams, and a few vehicles- that‚Äôs all shared. Except favorite cars, those are personally owned, Vision is absolutely hers, my flings are mine, for a few hours at least, and the boys, well, we all have a hand in raising them.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMaybe one day we‚Äôll split things, maybe one day we‚Äôll split the compound, maybe we won‚Äôt. If people want to think we‚Äôre a couple or think we have a polyamorous thing going on, it‚Äôs fine. This family works for us, and I love it.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio exhaled in wonder. ‚ÄúThat all sounds amazing. Raising your kids together, and being right there when you need each other?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt is pretty great.‚Äù Agatha agreed.
    </p>
<p>
     The Agatha image that the media portrayed was not the side of Agatha that Rio was seeing now. Yes, she could be flirty like that public persona, Rio had seen that firsthand. However, she was attentive and caring. The media made it seem as though she were all sarcasm, wit, and sexuality unless it came to parenting or her activism. However, Agatha was very focused on her inner circle, which included more than just Nicky. She had built a chosen family, was kind, offered women water when they were choking, and enjoyed watching sunsets. Agatha Harkness even had awkward moments and slipped up. Rio was looking forward to getting to know more about this woman.
    </p>
<p>
     As they talked after the sun went down and the moon had come up, Wanda and Alice looked on from the balcony of the beach house.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúFriends to idiots to lovers?‚Äù Alice asked, watching as Rio laughed at something that Agatha said and put a hand on Agatha‚Äôs bare arm.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYep,‚Äù Wanda said, popping the p.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen stepped up next to Alice, careful not to brush up against her, but giving her a warm smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat sidled up next to Wanda, quickly taking her hand and squeezing it, before letting it go as if nothing had happened.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen and Nat‚Äôs eyes automatically caught what the other two had been looking at.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen sighed. Apparently, she was now an accomplice to this. ‚ÄúSlow burn?‚Äù She added.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúUnfortunately.‚Äù Alice and Wanda said in unison.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAngst and drama because they‚Äôre afraid of their feelings and being hurt in the process,‚Äù Lilia added, stepping forth from the shadows. The four younger women just nodded. Completely unsurprised by her appearance.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚Äú...and we will be here to push all the way,‚Äù Nat added, looking at Wanda expectantly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda nodded and turned to Jen, ready to begin her plan. ‚ÄúAt ten, you and Alice will leave in Alice‚Äôs Jeep, which is why I made you ride with us. I don‚Äôt care where you go.‚Äù In her head, she was screaming ‚Äòone of your places, idiots‚Äô, but she didn‚Äôt voice it. If she could successfully matchmake two couples, she‚Äôd be thrilled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll leave Rio‚Äôs bag here. I‚Äôll text Agatha saying you both left. Knowing Agatha, she‚Äôll offer to either take Rio home or back to the compound to continue their conversation. Since Nat came in a different vehicle tonight, I‚Äôll have Nat take me home.‚Äù Wanda grinned. She loved when her plans came together.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen huffed a laugh and looked at Wanda fondly. ‚ÄúGot it, boss.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Jen and Alice went back to the party, and Nat returned to do her job, fingertips lightly brushing Wanda‚Äôs arm as she departed.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda‚Äôs eyes trailed after the other redhead, Lilia carefully watching both of them.
    </p>
<p>
     The older woman turned toward Wanda. ‚ÄúSometimes we do what we think is right, even though it is not what we want. You might be hurting someone by doing the ‚Äòright‚Äô thing. Times have changed.‚Äù She left before Wanda could respond. Wanda shook her head.
     <em>
      She‚Äôs right and you know it, Maximoff.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
     The stars twinkled in the sky and the sounds of the party filtered out of the house behind them. Agatha found it odd that no one else had wandered down to the beach and she had a feeling that was the doing of one Natasha Romanov and would have to thank her for it later. She enjoyed having this time to talk, uninterrupted, with Rio. The younger woman made Agatha really laugh, something few were able to do, and was easy to talk to.
    </p>
<p>
     The two women had abandoned their chairs and were sitting on a beach blanket, sides pressed together so they could hear each other over the sounds of the ocean and the party.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a natural lull in the conversation, and Agatha‚Äôs eyes had locked on Rio‚Äôs, when they dropped to Rio‚Äôs plump pink lips.
    </p>
<p>
     The tip of Agatha‚Äôs tongue swept over her own lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn‚Äôt sure if it was the alcohol, the ocean, the moon, or that shooting star, but she was extremely tempted to lean forward and find out if Rio‚Äôs lips were as soft as they looked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cleared her throat, and Agatha‚Äôs eyes darted back up to meet hers.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAgatha?‚Äù Rio said, voice wavering.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio looked into Agatha‚Äôs sapphire blue eyes that reflected the stars. Agatha had been staring at her, and Rio had thought about kissing her.
    </p>
<p>
     No, that was not something Rio could do. Agatha was a parent, and that was a boundary Rio had drawn. It was a mixture of the alcohol, the setting, and her silly childhood crush.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI can be your friend.‚Äù She said.
     <em>
      Idiot. You‚Äôre an idiot.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha‚Äôs smile reached her eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like that.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Something in Rio was relieved. She was worried she would cause offense or that Agatha would laugh and tell her that she was only here to add Rio to her CVS receipt length list of women.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs smile was bright. She did her best to mimic a teenage girl, ‚ÄúOMG! Wait until I tell my friends that I‚Äôm friends with Agatha Harkness!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smacked her on the arm, mood ruined. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a child.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded enthusiastically. ‚ÄúYou were almost an EGOT winner when I was born.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. Picking up her phone as it vibrated, notifying her of a text. ‚ÄúOh wow, we‚Äôve been down here awhile.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm amazing company.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pretended to ignore her as she suppressed a smile and read the text from Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

    </p>
<p>
     She left Rio‚Äôs bag though. MAKE A MOVE.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs phone went off next, to a text from Alice.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

<p>
     her house.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio and Agatha looked back up at each other. Rio spoke first. ‚ÄúDid you know that Jen and Alice were into each other?‚Äù She asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha just looked at her. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even know Jen existed until this week, NDAs, remember?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put a comforting hand on Rio‚Äôs knee, their sides still touching. They had decided to be friends, hadn‚Äôt kissed, yet hadn‚Äôt parted either.
    </p>
<p>
     This was not lost on Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha flashed an Oscar-winning smile. ‚ÄúWould you like to go back to my place? As friends, of course.‚Äù

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stood up from the sand in one fluid motion, without using her hands, in only a way Agatha Fucking Harkness could, and held out a hand to help Rio, which she gladly took.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mind leaving your party early?‚Äù Rio asked, noting that it was far from dying down.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, gods no. I usually leave before midnight anyway. It‚Äôs not about me and I prefer smaller affairs anyway, I‚Äôm getting too old for these big to-dos. I only stay out late for the awards after parties because it‚Äôs almost required.‚Äù Agatha tugged Rio to her feet and picked up their empty glasses. Agatha led them up the beach to the side of the house where a car was waiting, handed the glasses to one of the security guys, and nodded. ‚ÄúPizza and movies?‚Äù Agatha asked, gesturing for Rio to get into the large black SUV first.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. ‚ÄúI said let‚Äôs be friends and you‚Äôre asking me to Netflix and chill? Isn‚Äôt that a little outdated Harkness?‚Äù She asked with a bemused smile. Noting that her bag was in the car, surely Wanda‚Äôs doing.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes as the door closed behind them. ‚ÄúTrust me, if I was you up for nefarious reasons, you would know. I‚Äôm serious. And, as you don‚Äôt sleep with parents, I don‚Äôt sleep with my son‚Äôs teachers,‚Äù she thought for a moment. ‚Äúanymore.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. ‚ÄúAh, one of Hollywood‚Äôs bad boys cleaning up her act? For moi?‚Äù She replied, batting her eyelashes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSure, that‚Äôs why.‚Äù In reality, no one else interested her, but she wasn‚Äôt telling Rio that. ‚ÄúWhat kind of pizza do you want? I‚Äôm ordering now so it should be there when we arrive.‚Äù She asked, changing the subject. If they were doing this whole friend thing, she needed to shelve this line of talk.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúVeggie please, if that‚Äôs okay. Is Nicky home?‚Äù Rio asked. She hadn‚Äôt seen him much and wondered if he was doing something with his de facto cousins. She hadn‚Äôt even met Vision yet. She didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd meet him now, but was starting to wonder if he existed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúVeggie it is, and all three boys are with Vision having a horror movie marathon at the Clubhouse I was telling you about. The boys could stay by themselves, but they‚Äôre getting to the age where we wouldn‚Äôt put it past them to throw their own party, and we‚Äôre not quite ready for that. So, adult supervision it is. Billy wouldn‚Äôt, but the other two absolutely would.‚Äù She smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked out the window, watching the ocean pass them as they headed back towards the city. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it like? Knowing everyone knows so much about you?‚Äù She asked without thinking, automatically realizing how invasive the question was. ‚ÄúOh no! Don‚Äôt answer that.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha regarded her for a second, thinking about her response.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs okay, no one outside of an interview has ever asked me that before, and interviewers never want the real answer, a completely honest answer. It seems like the entire world knows everything about me, but it‚Äôs only what I want them to know.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhen my mother outed me in 1989, stripping my life bare for all to see and in turn exposing herself for who she really was, I was taught to curate a certain image.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYes, the public sees the dedicated mom, activist, trailblazer, ‚Äòbad boy‚Äô persona‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs what I want them to see. Just like I only show the parts of my personal life that I want to show.‚Äù Agatha chose her words carefully. She felt like she could tell Rio a lot, but she didn‚Äôt want to give just anything away. Agatha had layers and she never just stripped herself raw. She had done that once before and refused to do it again.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúInformation leaks, it always does. That‚Äôs why I have Jen and Nat. It‚Äôs why I send Nicky to a school with ironclad NDAs run by a woman I have known forever and trust. As a testament to how well it all works, Alice is a close friend of mine and has been a decade, and you had no idea.‚Äù Agatha watched Rio process and mull over everything she had just said before plowing on.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIf you know what you‚Äôre doing, know the right people, and play your cards right, then Hollywood can be both very public and extremely private at the same time. We have learned to control the narrative, and while our lives are on display, it‚Äôs the show we want people to see, and we take comfort in that.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúPeople will believe what they want to believe, but we can steer them in the direction of what we want them to believe. Few people know what really goes on behind these walls and that‚Äôs why I bought this land and enclosed it. So my family, chosen and otherwise, had an escape. A place we could be our authentic selves.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll start to learn that there are things about me you don‚Äôt know and you can decide for yourself if that‚Äôs a good or a bad thing.‚Äù Agatha kept her eyes locked on Rio. This was not a speech she often gave to people, it was not something she really ever told anyone. The last time she had broken down how curated her life was, was to Alice. That had been out of necessity, and she felt like this was too.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew that Rio was important to Alice, and Alice was important to Agatha, whether Alice believed it or not. Alice was Lorna‚Äôs daughter, and Agatha had made a promise to Lorna.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Rio took everything in and processed it. She wasn‚Äôt completely surprised that there was a hidden side to Agatha and that she carefully revealed what people knew about her. Rio had read about what had happened to her when she was outed and could see why Agatha had been advised to live the way she did.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio remembered Alice‚Äôs mother, Lorna, being an open book to the public, but keeping Alice hidden from view and out of the public eye. Rio knew double lives were possible, though Lorna didn‚Äôt really have a double life in as much as she had a mother who was willing to raise the daughter she rarely saw.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio realized that the more she learned about Agatha Harkness, the more of a mystery she became.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
     The large vehicle drove through the automatic gate and to the left, snaking around a driveway and coming to a stop in front of a large house that Rio assumed belonged to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped out first, offering her hand to Rio, who stepped out, slung her bag over her shoulder, and stopped abruptly when she saw the house before her.
    </p>
<p>
     For the second time that night, Rio was amazed by the beauty and architecture of a house.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The house was composed of glass and stone. A mix of modern and a hidden witch‚Äôs cottage. Rio chuckled. ‚ÄúNever beating those witch allegations Harkness.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     They walked through the covered porch and in the double doors, the smell of pizza in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. ‚ÄúMaybe I don‚Äôt want to. I like my vampire glass witch cottage thank you,‚Äù Agatha glanced over her shoulder to see if Rio caught the reference.
    </p>
<p>
     The younger woman laughed. ‚ÄúSurrounded by the trees, it does look like that. When did you have it built?‚Äù Rio followed Agatha through the foyer and into the living room. Three plush black couches surrounded a large dark wooden coffee table. A large TV was mounted on a wall surrounded by built-in shelves with pictures, books, and various decor items. The back wall was completely glass with a door that led out to a pool, which was lit and had various lights hanging in the patio area. The kitchen was open concept like the beach house, and was Rio‚Äôs dream kitchen. There was a bar directly behind the center couch. Someone could cook, fetch something, whatever was needed, and still be a part of whatever was happening in the main room. There were stairs back in the foyer, and she thought they had passed a bathroom. She was just realizing she was still in her bikini and shorts.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had gone to the kitchen and was getting something out of the fridge. Also still in her bikini and monogrammed cover-up. ‚ÄúLet me think, I bought the land in ‚Äò91, and Wanda and I built the clubhouse in ‚Äò97. She built her house in 2005 when she and Vision got married, and I started building mine around the time I decided to have Nicky and it was completed in ‚Äò08.‚Äù She walked into the living room carrying the pizza box, a bottle of wine, and two glasses.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúImpressive. That‚Äôs quite a history lesson. Before we eat, where‚Äôs the bathroom? I should change out of this swimsuit.‚Äù She asked.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha looked down at herself and laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI completely forgot. When you‚Äôre so used to wearing whatever people tell you to, you just go with it.‚Äù In reality, Agatha had been admiring Rio‚Äôs current attire. Friends could appreciate the scenery. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs back down the hall, on the left. I should probably change too.‚Äù Agatha set everything down and followed Rio, before disappearing up the stairs.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It wasn‚Äôt long before they were seated on the couch, Rio in forest green shorts and a Stanford Basketball tank top, Agatha in black yoga pants, and a purple SHIELD football mom shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had turned the music on for background noise, a nineties playlist Wanda had made. Agatha knew it had to be safe if Wanda had made it.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you cute in your mom shirt?‚Äù Rio smirked, finishing her second slice of pizza in about as many minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHas anyone told you that you eat like a teenage boy?‚Äù Agatha responded, still eating her first slice.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOnly everyone I‚Äôve ever met.‚Äù Rio sipped her wine. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a habit left over from how I grew up.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúSounds like there‚Äôs a story there. How did you meet Alice? You know a lot about my background, what‚Äôs the Rio Vidal story?‚Äù Agatha asked, taking another slice of pizza. Agatha knew some of Rio‚Äôs story, but wanted to hear it from the source.
    </p>
<p>
     They sat on the center couch, the same way she and Wanda often did. Her tucked in one corner, Rio tucked in the other, facing each other. It felt natural, even if they were new friends.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Rio started, biting her lip, thinking about how much she wanted to divulge, and then sighing. Might as well go all in, no telling what Alice had already shared. ‚ÄúMy parents moved to San Francisco when I was 12. We moved around a lot and didn‚Äôt live in the best places. They weren‚Äôt the best people. It was my biological mom, she was great until my first stepdad left when I was about five. That‚Äôs when she started dating the wrong people. I never knew my dad. Anyway, she and my then stepdad, number six I think?‚Äù She scoffed. ‚ÄúI started at a new middle school, an extremely awkward age to start over with no friends and very little anything. I met Alice on the first day I was there. She was standing off to the side judging people like you do at that age, and I awkwardly stood next to her and made a comment about the group she was watching. Our preteen surliness was a match made in melodramatic heaven.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe had several advanced classes together and we would work together on our projects. After a few weeks, I missed the bus home one afternoon. When I told her the neighborhood I lived in, she insisted that she walk me home. When we reached the door, we heard gunshots in my apartment. She dragged me back to her Gran‚Äôs house and refused to let me go back to my apartment. She and Gran insisted I stay the night, especially since my mom didn‚Äôt pick up the phone when I called.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhen I finally got through to my mom, they were both fine. They had made someone upset and what we had heard were warning shots.‚Äù Rio smiled slightly at the memory and looked up at Agatha. ‚ÄúYou were friends with Lorna, right? So you knew her mom, Norma?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded and Rio continued, ‚ÄúWell, imagine how pissed Norma Wu was when she found out about my home life. From then on, I spent most of my time there, and by the time I was fourteen, I had my own room and lived there ninety-five percent of the time. It got to where she was the one school called, she was my emergency contact. Gran finished raising me. I was shocked when I saw a picture one day and realized that Lorna Wu was Alice‚Äôs mom.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAnytime I did go home, it wasn‚Äôt a good time. My parents basically forgot I existed unless they needed my help with something illegal, and as much as Gran tried to fight them, they had legal rights. When I went back to Gran‚Äôs, it was with marks, bruises, burns, and so much trauma.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThey really didn‚Äôt care where I was, as long as I was there whenever they needed me for whatever illegal activity or scheme required a pretty young girl. They finally died at the beginning of my senior year of high school. I had recently returned from a short stint with them, things had gone terribly south, there was a lot of yelling when I was finally able to sneak out and run back home.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt there long when the police showed up and told me they had died. I stayed with Gran and Alice, and as terrible as it sounds, a weight was lifted. Gran seemed a lot less worried after that too.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe both went to Stanford, something we worked so hard for. While teaching is not the most glorious thing we could do with our lives, it was something that allowed us to give back. Alice wanted to do something, not simple, but normal. Civilian, as she called it, and I think Lorna put it into her head when she was young. I‚Äôve just always loved learning and sharing knowledge. So that‚Äôs what we did. We also wanted to make Gran proud of us, and we did.‚Äù Rio looked back at Agatha, whose eyes were red and watery. ‚ÄúAgatha, please don‚Äôt cry, we all have our past.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha knew how much the past affected Alice,¬† and how much Rio meant to her. Agatha also knew details that Rio would never be privy to.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to wrap her arms around Rio and hold her, to try and take the pain away. She wanted to cradle this woman‚Äôs head to her chest and hold her there.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she put a hand on Rio‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúI am so sorry you had such a rough start and had to go through all that.‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs eyes took in the lines and light wrinkles in Rio‚Äôs face. Memorizing every detail. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe parents would do things like that to their children. I mean, my mother did, but she was a very special case. I am so glad Norma was there for you.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs breath caught at the way Agatha‚Äôs eyes were taking her in. ‚ÄúAgatha, it‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôve done a lot of therapy since then.‚Äù Rio looked away and tucked her hair behind her ear. ‚ÄúThank you though. Norma Wu was an amazing woman and I loved her like she was my Mom.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dropped her hand from Rio‚Äôs shoulder, letting her fingertips trail down Rio‚Äôs arm, and moved back slightly. ‚ÄúThat makes sense as to why you were there those times I came to see Lorna, and at the funeral.‚Äù Agatha also remembered seeing an ‚ÄòR‚Äô on the door of the room next to Alice‚Äôs door with the ‚ÄòA‚Äô on it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nearly choked, something Agatha was becoming good at making her do. ‚ÄúYou remember that.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou looked like you were going to kill me. Yes, I remember. If anyone asks, I do not remember, as I very pointedly told everyone I did not, did you ever tell Alice what happened?‚Äù Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhich time?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúEither one.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. ‚ÄúThat I caught you sneaking out of her mother‚Äôs room? No. I did tell her I thought the two of you were a thing and she assured me you weren‚Äôt. I believe her now.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. ‚ÄúWe very much were not. I was just there to get her to come back and finish shooting, then I got her into rehab.‚Äù It was the lie that Agatha always told.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúShe never did outrun her demons. Alice doesn‚Äôt blame you though, and neither do I.‚Äù Rio added.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha‚Äôs heart clenched. Rio still didn‚Äôt know, and it wasn‚Äôt Agatha‚Äôs place to tell her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, I know,‚Äù Agatha assured her. ‚ÄúCome with me, I want to show you something.‚Äù She said, standing and picking up the now-empty pizza box and the empty bottle of wine.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio rose up to follow her as Agatha led through the kitchen first, disposing of the empty containers, and then back to the front of the house into what Rio assumed was an office.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThis is my Harkness brag room,‚Äù Agatha turned on the light.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHow humble of you,‚Äù Rio smirked, noting that she was wrong about the office. Her breath caught as she took in the cases full of different awards, the memorabilia from different shows and movies Agatha had been in, pictures of her with other celebrities, trophies, and medals Nicky had won, various pictures of him, her, Wanda, and Nat. There were so many memories captured around the giant room.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn‚Äôt about bragging per se, it was about preserving precious memories, like a living time capsule. Rio walked around various set pieces, even costumes encased in glass. ‚ÄúThis is amazing. I can‚Äôt believe they let you keep some of this stuff.‚Äù She came to one piece in particular and squealed. ‚ÄúTHE COAT! From Witches Road! I thought it was destroyed!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo, that was a backup. This one is the original, with all of the details and everything. I even have Lorna‚Äôs jacket from the movie.‚Äù She nodded to another case.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou two were close.‚Äù The younger woman stated, looking at a picture from that night at The Oscars.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúShe was one of my mentors.‚Äù Agatha lowered her voice, measuring her words carefully. ‚ÄúOf course, we were. I was in the ambulance that night, I held her hand as she‚Ä¶I promised I would watch over Alice.‚Äù She looked away as a tear fell.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, it was Rio‚Äôs turn to be the comforter.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo, you didn‚Äôt. Lorna knew what she was doing. That movie consumed her, it happens to some of the best actors and you did everything you could.‚Äù Rio stepped back as Agatha gave her a watery smile.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhy are you so easy to bare my soul too?‚Äù Agatha asked, wiping a tear away with her thumb.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm secretly a soul-stealing witch,‚Äù Rio replied with a tooth-baring smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha huffed a laugh and pointed out a few more set pieces and several pictures.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio took in the many pictures from various decades. She noted that Lorna was in many of them, and of course, Agatha and Wanda were constantly paired together. The room was a large, living, breathing time capsule, and Rio was fascinated.
    </p>
<p>
     Pictures from the opening nights of Rent and Wicked, the premier of Frozen and Frozen II, Agatha having played Elsa.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúCan you tell me anything about Frozen III?‚Äù Rio quirked a brow.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ran tongue along the inside of her bottom lip. ‚ÄúI cannot.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio huffed. ‚ÄúFine, want to play a game to Frozen?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The morning sun was warm on Rio‚Äôs face as she rubbed her eyes. She blinked multiple times, trying to get her bearings. Rio had suggested a drinking game to Frozen, as you do at thirty-five and fifty-one.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had learned that Agatha Harkness did not back down from a challenge.
    </p>
<p>
     The game was simple. Drink every time there was queer subtext.
    </p>
<p>
     They had to switch to water rather quickly and then continued talking through Frozen II.
    </p>
<p>
     Watching Agatha Harkness movies with Agatha Harkness was enlightening, especially when Wanda was in them. Wanda played Anna in the movie, given their connection, and Agatha told multiple stories about the recording and artistry.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio looked around her as she gathered her thoughts. She was lying on the couch opposite the glass wall. Agatha was still asleep on the center couch, face buried in her arms. Rio grabbed her phone, noticing that it was seven and past her cat‚Äôs scheduled breakfast time. Rio was many things and a crazy cat lady was one of them. Not wanting to wake Agatha and having received zero texts from Alice, she thought about who else she could text for a ride home. Rio didn‚Äôt know many people here yet. She had however gotten the impression that she was being welcomed into this group of women, and of that group, Nat was the most likely to be awake. Considering meddling had happened to get Agatha‚Äôs number into her phone, she probably had everyone‚Äôs number. Rio opened a new message and typed in a few letters when the contact appeared.
     <em>
      Thank you, meddling bitches.

<p>
     Rio let out a sigh and found her bag. She went to the bathroom, to freshen up and slip her shoes on. Nat had disarmed the alarm remotely and Rio stepped out of the house right as the petite bodyguard pulled up in a red SUV. The younger woman put her bag in the backseat and climbed in the front. Nat handed her Tylenol and pointed to the coffee.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThought you would need these.‚Äù She smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Rio grumbled as she took the Tylenol and chased it with the coffee. ‚ÄúAny word from Alice and Jen?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Nat shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôve been waiting for them to pull that trigger for years now. At least they actually stayed the night though.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just chuckled. ‚ÄúCreeper.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt is my job to know where everyone is,‚Äù she replied.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhich is why I didn‚Äôt bother giving you my address.‚Äù She looked over at the redhead.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou live in the same building as Alice, so I don‚Äôt need it anyway, but you‚Äôre right. I assume you talked, drank, and that‚Äôs it?‚Äù Nat asked, keeping her eyes on the road, although there was no traffic to speak of early on a Sunday morning.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúExactly. You can report that back to the Meddling Bitches group chat.‚Äù Rio took another sip of her coffee.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good name for it, actually. You know Agatha will report everything to Wanda anyway.‚Äù.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, I know she will.‚Äù Rio had gathered that Agatha told Wanda everything. ‚ÄúHow did you join up with Wanda and Agatha? I know the ‚Äòmet at a club in New York‚Äô story, but I have a feeling there‚Äôs more to it. I know you‚Äôve been with them almost as long as they‚Äôve known each other.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Nat raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúFast learner. Well, you know I‚Äôm from Russia, that‚Äôs not hard to gather, the Romanov is a dead giveaway, and I still have the slightest accent on certain words. Would you believe me if I told you I was a very young assassin?‚Äù Nat looked at Rio from the corner of her eye to gauge Rio‚Äôs response.
    </p>
<p>
     The response was laughter as Rio looked at her. ‚ÄúOh please, I mean, I had heard the rumors, but‚Ä¶‚Äù She noticed that Nat was not laughing. ‚ÄúWait, it‚Äôs true? You actually were sent by Agatha‚Äôs mom to kill her before she died in prison?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSure was.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúBut how?‚Äù She was flabbergasted at this point. What the hell kind of people had she become friends with?
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúTurns out Agatha Harkness and Wanda Maximoff are not the type of people you want to meet in a dark alley. Assassin or not. It‚Äôs a longer story, but basically, Agatha punched me in the face, Wanda stepped on my throat, which was surprisingly pleasant...but anyway, Agatha made me an offer to be on her security team, some legal stuff happened, and the rest is history.‚Äù She shrugged as they pulled up to Rio‚Äôs building.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat back, ‚ÄúSo Agatha just collects people like Infinity Stones?‚Äù She asked.
    </p>
<p>
     The other woman nodded. ‚ÄúWomen that need a family, yes.‚Äù Don‚Äôt forget to text Agatha so she doesn‚Äôt wake up and freak out that you‚Äôre gone.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio walked into her apartment to one very angry cat.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOkay, okay, I‚Äôm sorry. Let me put my bag down.‚Äù It took her longer than usual to feed Raven due to the self-appointed queen getting under her feet, jumping on the counter, and yelling at her in her way. ‚ÄúYou better hope I never start dating anyone and sleep over at their house you freeloader.‚Äù She said as she put her bowl down. She pulled out her phone and texted Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Me
     </b>
</p>
<p>
     Sorry for leaving without a word
    </p>
<p>
     this morning. Had to get home to
    </p>
<p>
     feed the cat. Nat gave me a ride.
    </p>
<p>
     She was hired to kill you?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio assumed she‚Äôd hear from her later and knew Alice would just come over. She had a lot to process but needed to shower first.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had woken up, read Rio‚Äôs text, and taken a shower. It was too early to formulate words. What ungodly hour had that woman gotten up at? The time stamp said eight, who did those things on a weekend? In Agatha‚Äôs mind, that constituted as a red flag.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned against the counter, coffee mug raised to her lips, as she ran through what to text back.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSorry for crying on you? No. Desperate.‚Äù Agatha sipped on her coffee but didn‚Äôt put it down as she stared at the phone, thumb hovering over the letters of the touchscreen.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúGlad we got drunk together? Yeah, absolutely not, Harkness, this is not the early aughts.‚Äù She took a long drink of her coffee and sat the mug on the counter, holding the phone with two hands now.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was in her fifties, she knew how to communicate with women.
    </p>
<p>
     It was literally part of what gave her her reputation.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

      Me:

     to get home and feed her. Glad

<p>
     we got to hang out!
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Okay, that wasn‚Äôt too bad, maybe a little overly enthusiastic. Agatha found that she wasn‚Äôt completely in control of herself around Rio. A fluke, really.

<p>
     Thanks, I enjoyed it. Can‚Äôt wait to do it again.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had noticed the green heart those wenches she called friends had put next to Rio's name and decided to leave it. At least she hadn‚Äôt scared Rio off, yet. So far, the friends thing was going well and she knew it was just a matter of time before Wanda ran in to demand to hear everything unless she had already talked to Natasha. Wanda would still want to hear everything directly from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     As if summoned by her thoughts, Wanda ran through the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn‚Äôt bothered resetting the alarm, which would have been useless, as Wanda could deactivate it from her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúGet in here and tell me everything,‚Äù Wanda demanded, launching herself on the couch as though she weren‚Äôt forty-five, and assuming her normal position.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned and moved to join her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚Äú...and that‚Äôs all. Nothing happened. Friendly touches, tears, pizza, a drinking game, and we passed out.‚Äù She summarized after droning on for the past hour.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it? You acted like you were twenty-two, were moderately drunk, and you didn‚Äôt even make out? You make out with everyone when you‚Äôre drunk, we‚Äôve done it a time or two.‚Äù Wanda admonished.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNot everyone, only women, and we haven‚Äôt done that in a while, I remember being threatened. I also don‚Äôt drink to get drunk and have things under control.‚Äù She pointed out. ‚ÄúBesides, Rio and I are friends. ONLY FRIENDS.‚Äù Agatha gave Wanda a pointed look.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù Wanda pouted. ‚ÄúI happen to think with the similar backgrounds, similar interests, etc., it would go well.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head, holding her hands out in front of her. ‚ÄúWhatever you say, but it‚Äôs not happening.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
     After leaving Jen‚Äôs house, Alice went straight to Rio‚Äôs apartment instead of her own. Alice walked in, using her key, and handed Rio a container of vegetable fried rice. ‚ÄúIt tastes almost like Gran‚Äôs.‚Äù She sat the rest of the containers on the coffee table and sat on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThe fried rice I make tastes just like Gran‚Äôs, because she taught me how to make it.‚Äù Rio looked at Alice suspiciously. Chinese take-out meant one thing.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time. I‚Äôm panicking in a lesbian way.‚Äù Alice whined.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThere it is, water? Soda? Tea?‚Äù Rio listed off beverages and headed toward the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWater, I need to hydrate.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI bet you do!‚Äù Rio chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice pouted, ‚ÄúUnfortunately, not like that.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio came back and handed Alice her water before settling into the couch with her fried rice, Alice already cradling wonton soup close to her chest. ‚ÄúWe went back to Jen‚Äôs place and had a movie night.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhat movies?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúBound and I Can‚Äôt Think Straight. Movies we have both seen. Multiple times. With each other.‚Äù Alice lamented.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúShit, Alice, what happened?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúStraight up gay panic of the middle age variety. We cuddled, Ri. We fell asleep like that, and then I snuck out and didn‚Äôt even say goodbye. We have been decently close friends since I moved out here. Ten years, Rio. Ten.‚Äù Alice took a bite of a dumpling, shaking her head at her own idiocy.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSo let me get this sapphic, the two of you have been circling each other for years now, dropping hints like carabiners at Lilith Fair, and still nothing?‚Äù Rio asked, disbelief written all over her face.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOur inaction is physically painful at this point,‚Äù Alice winced.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you waiting for? Her to invite you to a Melissa Etheridge concert?‚Äù Rio had finished eating and was gesturing with hands.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMuna or Xana might be more her speed, but no. It‚Äôs just, that she‚Äôs so serious and aggressive with everything and I‚Äôm way more laid back. Plus she‚Äôs always busy.‚Äù Alice explained.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed heavily. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a teacher, there are months where no one even sees us. Her clients are your family, and she spends time with them too, right? You would balance each other out well.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIf this were a book or a movie, I would yell at the characters right now.‚Äù Alice groaned. ‚ÄúEnough about me. You and Agatha, stepping into friendship, that‚Äôs awesome.‚Äù She gave her a double thumbs up and a sarcastic wink.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh go to hell, Wu,‚Äù Rio replied. Rio had filled Alice in on everything that had happened the previous night and Rio was very glad she had made the decision to join SHIELD and that Alice could talk to her more freely now. There was so much Rio hadn‚Äôt known about Alice the past ten years.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the last week before school starts. Open House and Meet-the-Teacher is on Tuesday, and we have planning and all of the things that come with it for the rest of the week. Anything next weekend?‚Äù Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice shook her head. ‚ÄúNothing that I can think of. Sports haven‚Äôt started yet, and I can‚Äôt think of any parties or anything.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù Rio wanted time to prepare to be in this new world of celebrity parents, celebrity children, dealing with public relations reps, possible paparazzi, and the other things that might pop up. It was going to be a wild ride and she needed to be prepared.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Tuesday arrived and Rio was dressed in the required jeans and SHIELD t-shirt for the night. The faculty were lined up on stage behind Lilia Calderu as she addressed the parents, guardians, and adults responsible for the various students of SHIELD before setting everyone free for the event. Calderu would dismiss the teachers to their classrooms first. She would then address the families separately before allowing them to roam the campus grounds.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAs a reminder, everyone has signed a set of iron-clad NDAs that covers everything that could possibly come up. These NDAs apply for students, all reps, agents, etc. We take privacy very seriously here at SHIELD and it‚Äôs one of the reasons we are the elite educational institution for the best and brightest in Hollywood and the upper class. While our teachers get to their classrooms‚Ä¶‚Äù That was their cue and the faculty turned and exited the stage.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had spotted Agatha and Wanda as they entered earlier, and a few other now familiar faces. She waved to Alice as they split to go to their separate rooms. Rio left her door open, double checked that the slideshow was scrolling automatically and that the handouts were neatly organized. She took a deep breath and took her position at the front of the room to meet parents and students, just like she had every year at her previous school. With six different periods, she would be meeting a lot of students and parents over the next hour and a half.
    </p>
<p>
     The secretary‚Äôs voice came over the loudspeaker to announce that parents and students were being released to make their way around their respective buildings.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHere we go‚Äù Rio whispered to herself as the first few parents started to filter in.
    </p>
<p>
     She shook hands, handed out information, made small talk, told students what they would need, and smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     Her smile widened when Wanda, Agatha, boys, and a man she assumed was Vision walked in.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRio Vidal, this is my husband, Dr. Vision Maximoff. He‚Äôs a professor at UCLA.‚Äù Wanda smiled brightly, though it did not reach her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so nice to meet you Dr. Maximoff, I‚Äôve heard a lot about you.‚Äù Rio lied. Wanda‚Äôs smile melted into one of sincere appreciation that Vision didn‚Äôt see.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúPlease, call me Vision. I‚Äôve heard a lot about you from all the ladies in my life, and have a feeling you‚Äôll soon be a fixture at the compound,‚Äù Vision replied with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     The boys just groaned and Rio gave a polite chuckle. It seemed as though Wanda made sure to keep the little coven around at all times.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNicky and Tommy, it‚Äôs nice to see you both again. You must be Billy.‚Äù Rio shook each of their hands.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYes, hi Ms. Vidal.‚Äù He replied shyly. He was the kid who took after Vision. They spoke for a second before Vision and the boys moved to the next class. Wanda put her arm on Rio‚Äôs bicep and spoke softly.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre meeting up with Jen, Nat, and Alice after this for a late dinner, you‚Äôre coming.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn‚Äôt a request.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced at Agatha who was talking to Pepper Potts-Stark, who had a hand on Agatha‚Äôs arm. What was that story? Rio wondered.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI rode with Alice and it sounds like I don‚Äôt have a choice.‚Äù She blew air out of her nose in amusement.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda‚Äôs smile widened. ‚ÄúGlad we‚Äôre on the same page, see you later!‚Äù She turned and grabbed Agatha‚Äôs arm as she said goodbye to Pepper, and they moved to the next classroom.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at the clock, noticing there was still another half hour to go.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the night was uneventful as Rio collected her belongings and walked out the door, hearing it click shut behind her as Alice walked toward her from down the hall.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHey, Wanda told me about dinner,‚Äù Rio said as her friend came up beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄòOh, yeah, it‚Äôs tradition. I was going to tell you when we were done.‚Äù Alice chewed nervously on her pinky nail. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to go if you don‚Äôt want to though. It‚Äôs late and we have work. Plus Raven needs to be fed,‚Äù Alice blurted out quickly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned her head and looked at Alice suspiciously as they walked out of the building.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou let me take your car before anyone arrived so I could go feed her highness early, and it‚Äôs only 8:00. We‚Äôll get home later than normal, but we have a late report time in the morning. Since when do you not‚Ä¶‚Äù Rio stopped as realization hit.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOhhhh! You haven‚Äôt talked to one Ms. Kale since you ghosted her Sunday morning! How many texts has she sent you? Calls? Voicemails? No. She‚Äôs not that type.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Alice was at the car, glaring back at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio jogged the rest of the way and got in the vehicle. ‚ÄúOh, Wanda is going to make the two of you sit next to each other!‚Äù She cackled as they got in the car.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWell, we know where you‚Äôre sitting!‚Äù Alice shot back.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, I would sit in Agatha‚Äôs lap if it meant having a front-row seat to whatever this is about to be.‚Äù She replied, laughing harder.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When they arrived, just as expected, the only two seats that were left were one next to Jen and one next to Agatha, with Wanda directing each of them as to where to sit. It was an old-style diner, a burgers, and milkshakes type of place. Everyone placed their orders before delving into the conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a round table so that everyone could see and speak to each other. Rio and Alice sat next to each other and could have switched places, but Wanda‚Äôs look said that they would not be doing that.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda sat on the other side of Agatha, with Nat next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice immediately dug her nails into Rio‚Äôs thigh and turned to talk to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen ignored Alice and spoke with Nat.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAlice,‚Äù Rio whispered. ‚ÄúShe is not happy with the way you left things. Talk to her, now.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Jen looked across the table at Agatha, ‚ÄúI know you have a lot of press to run, a few projects in post, but I have a few ‚Äî ‚Äú
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put up a hand to stop her. ‚ÄúNo shop talk right now, and I‚Äôm with Rio.‚Äù She pointed at Alice. ‚ÄúTalk.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Alice had turned to Nat and Wanda who had done the same thing and told her to talk to Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     The two women turned to each other with four sets of eyes on them. When Jen turned to look at everyone else, the other four started talking to each other. Jen turned back to Alice.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice took a deep breath, she had no idea what she was going to do or say. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry for how I left Sunday morning. I don‚Äôt know what got into me.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      I‚Äôm tired of running and I wanted to kiss you because I want more and I‚Äôm tired of pretending I‚Äôm okay with just being friends.
     </em>
     She left that unspoken, not for here.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen almost always knew what she wanted out of her life. It‚Äôs not that she didn‚Äôt know what she wanted, it‚Äôs that she knew Alice was one of her closest friends. She cherished the times they had together. She was already worried she would lose Alice now that Rio was in town, she couldn‚Äôt risk dating her and them breaking up.
    </p>
<p>
     The fact remained that Jen wanted nothing more than to actually be with Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     She took a sip of her drink, her throat suddenly dry.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI understand. And, about that, it was nice, but you know I‚Äôm not looking for anything serious right now.‚Äù Jen‚Äôs heart ached as she spoke the words, her eyes searching Alice‚Äôs to see how she took it. Maybe, just maybe, Alice would read Jen‚Äôs mind.
     <em>
      You, I want you.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice looked down, not wanting Jen to see into her shattered soul. ‚ÄúOh, right, I know, and you know I‚Äôm not either. How often have we had those talks with each other, right?‚Äù Alice tried to give a small laugh, but it fell flat.
     <em>
      This bitch.
     </em>
     ‚ÄúJust friends and occasional movie cuddle buddies?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Something had flashed across Alice‚Äôs face, but it happened so quickly that Jennifer couldn‚Äôt quite tell what it was as she was clouded by her own hurt. ‚ÄúOf course, always.‚Äù She smiled and turned back to the group. ‚ÄúYes, can we help you bunch of Nosey Nellie‚Äôs?‚Äù Jen asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put a comforting hand on Alice‚Äôs leg.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, just a natural lull in conversation is all,‚Äù Agatha mused.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúFor the duration of ours?‚Äù Jen asked dryly.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúCoincidence.‚Äù Agatha looked across at Nat and asked a random question, getting everyone to start talking again.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda wanted to scream. Why would these idiots not let her push them together? Jen and Alice were the perfect balance for each other, and they may not see it, but Wanda knew there was love there.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio were basically soulmates.
    </p>
<p>
     Idiots.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda Maximoff was surrounded by relationship-impaired idiots, why wouldn‚Äôt they listen to her when she obviously had all the answers?
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Nat bit back a laugh. She could tell Wanda was about to implode and it was adorable. She shook her head slightly, trying to shake the thought out of her head. Nat knew Wanda wanted everyone else to be happy in love, to live their happy ending, when Wanda herself was very much not.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat quickly squeezed Wanda‚Äôs thigh and watched the other redhead visibly relax.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Alice and Jen.
     <em>
      Maybe they should focus on themselves instead of meddling with others.
     </em>
     She glanced at Agatha. She couldn‚Äôt believe she was friends with this group of women, let alone Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at each woman one by one. Maybe if they would stop meddling and focus on themselves, they would figure out what they wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     Their food came and they chatted over current events and other celebrities while they ate. She and Rio had a private conversation about a television series that only they watched, agreeing that the background sapphic romance needed to take more screen time. Season three was set to premiere the following spring and they made plans to watch it together.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was planning to watch a show with someone months in advance.
     <em>
      Like a friend
     </em>
     . She told herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda kept looking at her throughout their meal, the two stars had a way of speaking by just looking at each other.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda darted her eyes at Rio.
     <em>
      Take the leap, ask her out.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes.
     <em>
      Take your own advice.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda glared.
     <em>
      It‚Äôs complicated and you know that.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed.
     <em>
      We‚Äôre a mess, angel.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda shrugged and nodded.
     <em>
      At least we‚Äôll always have each other Aggie.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded and winked.
     <em>
      I love you.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda smiled and looked down.
     <em>
      I love you too.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Once in the car, Rio smacked Alice‚Äôs arm.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an idiot! Gran would smack you so hard your ancestors would have felt it!‚Äù Rio exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOw! Good thing I hadn‚Äôt started driving yet!‚Äù Alice exclaimed as she started to drive.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou like that beautiful woman and you two decided to just be friends. What is this? High school!? If it doesn‚Äôt work out, then it doesn‚Äôt work out and you act like adults. When we get home, you will be calling her and asking her out on a date. Do I need to be there to witness it? Because I will. Ten years, you useless lesbians.‚Äù She sighed and sunk back into her seat after her rant.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice stared out of the windshield, a sly smile on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice was overjoyed to have her sister back in her life.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen was grateful to be in her car.¬† She made a quick escape, waving goodbye to her friends with a tight-lipped smile and practically running to the car before Wanda could get on to her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Once in the car and on the road, she turned on the music and did something that Jennifer Kale did not do.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She cried.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio showered, and settled in bed with her bedtime playlist on. Raven curled up next to her when her phone dinged.

<p>
     Well, at least Wanda is currently

<p>

    </p>
<p>
     She truly likes Jen. Maybe more?
    </p>
<p>
     She‚Äôs just worried they‚Äôll lose the
    </p>
<p>
     friendship. I understand, but they‚Äôre
    </p>
<p>
     grown women. They‚Äôll figure it

<p>
     Because Alice Wu-(Gulliver)
    </p>

     doesn‚Äôt run when shit gets hard.
    </p>
<p>
     She also is as hard-headed
    </p>
<p>
     as Kale is. If anyone can handle

     She spends way more time

     But you can‚Äôt just ask her either.

     She has to tell you in her time.

<p>
     You have to be patient.

     So there is something there.
    </p>

     I didn‚Äôt say that. However,

     most.

     Anyway, on Labor Day weekend, we usually
    </p>
<p>
     hang out at the beach house. I‚Äôm assuming
    </p>
<p>
     Alice hasn‚Äôt told you yet. It‚Äôs the group, the
    </p>
<p>
     boys, and Vision. Though the menfolk
    </p>
<p>
     generally go fishing during the day. Want
    </p>
<p>
     to join us?
    </p>
<p>

      Me:

<p>
     I mean, Alice and I are as
    </p>
<p>
     attached as you and Wanda
    </p>
<p>
     are to each other, so yes.
    </p>
<p>

<p>
     Good, you aren‚Äôt supposed to be.

      Agatha üíú

</p>
<p>
     It‚Äôs getting late and you have work

<p>
     Tomorrow. Go to sleep. Goodnight, Rio.

      Me:

<p>
     Goodnight, Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio put her phone aside and smiled. She would tell Alice all about it in the morning. A weekend at Agatha‚Äôs beach house sounded like a lot of fun, even with three students. With this new group of friends, she had a feeling everything was going to be a lot different from now on.

      Jennifer Kale had cried for exactly two minutes. It had quite possibly been the most she had cried in ten years over something personal. She walked into her townhouse, locked her door, and began to go through her nighttime routine. She had a meticulous skincare regimen she followed. Alice constantly told her that she didn‚Äôt need it and that Jen‚Äôs skin was naturally perfect, but she wasn‚Äôt taking any chances.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Alice.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen huffed and stamped her foot in the empty bedroom, now wearing silk pajamas.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      How dare Alice sneak out of here like a coward Sunday morning and then tell her they should just be friends? They had cuddled on that very couch multiple times and fallen asleep. Didn‚Äôt ALL sapphics with crushes on each other do that? Wasn‚Äôt that some unwritten law somewhere?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Didn‚Äôt Alice know she was supposed to stop Jen and say, ‚ÄúNo. We will not be doing the just friends thing. We should be together.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen should have known that Alice wasn‚Äôt going to do that. Alice was a protector, she defended. She didn‚Äôt charge in blindly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Neither of them did. It‚Äôs why they had been in this predicament forever.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had hoped that Rio's moving here would spur Alice to make a move. Alice talked about Rio constantly, about how Rio always gave her the courage to do things.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So much for that plan.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen rinsed and washed her face before rubbing in moisturizer when her phone rang. It was the distinct ringtone she had given to Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She patted her face dry while reaching for the device.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A video call.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFine, Alice, I‚Äôll play.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She answered and immediately smiled upon seeing Alice wearing Jen‚Äôs University of Oregon shirt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGo on a date with me.‚Äù Alice blurted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen couldn‚Äôt hide her shock as her mouth hung open. ‚ÄúW-what did you just say to me?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI like you, Jen, and I have for years. I know we don‚Äôt want to risk our friendship, but I can‚Äôt pretend anymore, okay? Go out with me. Saturday. There‚Äôs ‚Äî‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes. Saturday.‚Äù Jen cut her off with a wide smile, her eyes sparkling. She didn‚Äôt care where they went. She just knew it was about time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>

      The rest of the week flew by as Rio and Alice prepared for the first day of school on the upcoming Monday. Alice had asked Jen out, and they were scheduled to go out the upcoming Saturday. On a real date. Their friends were possibly more excited than they were. The Friday before, Agatha and Wanda met with Jen about offers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen walked into Agatha‚Äôs house, where they often met. Her office was more for her to have phone calls and handle meetings with heads of studios and the like. When she dealt with her ‚Äòtalent‚Äô, which was only Agatha and Wanda, she did so at their houses, usually Agatha‚Äôs, and killed two birds with one stone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned on her laptop and laid her folders down.‚ÄúFirst, I would like to thank you both for recently making the PR side of my job easy. Agatha, you‚Äôve been lying relatively low. A certain brunette keeping you from hoeing about?‚Äù She jabbed, ‚ÄúWanda, you always do great.‚Äù She smiled at both of them, sincerely at Wanda, who smiled back from her normal spot as Agatha flipped her off from hers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jennifer rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúReal mature, Harkness. Anyway, you both have the press for your upcoming releases, various things in post, multiple commercial campaigns running, and awards season coming up. Also, Wanda, you, and Nat are leaving this afternoon for some things in New York this weekend. And... I have offers for you both.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Marvel is offering you roles, but as you know, Marvel comes with massive secrecy. You won‚Äôt even know what those roles are until after you talk with them and accept them. Disney, knowing how well you work together, also has opposite roles for both of you. Then there‚Äôs a TV show, Agatha, a comedy, something you‚Äôd be great at. Wanda, a movie for Netflix, definitely would be an award-winner. What do you think?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They looked at each other and back at Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù They said in unison.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNeither of you even knows the location, dates, anything.‚Äù She responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt provide any of that information, meaning you don‚Äôt have it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen sighed. ‚ÄúCaught me. We know Marvel doesn‚Äôt have it yet. Disney will work around Marvel, and we have to know those two to know about the third roles for each of you. We‚Äôre looking at the next few years being taken up by Marvel and Disney, with some smaller projects in between. I will get back to everyone, and we‚Äôll start the processes.‚Äù She shot off the emails she had already drafted, put everything back in her bag, and looked at them. ‚ÄúNow, on to more important things. I have a date with Alice tomorrow, and I don‚Äôt know what to wear, and, oddly,¬† I‚Äôm nervous.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was idly scrolling through her phone. ‚ÄúJust go back to her place, strip, and get it all out of both of your systems. You‚Äôve been circling each other like horny lesbian sharks for years.‚Äù She responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda‚Äôs jaw dropped. ‚ÄúAGATHA!‚Äù She gasped. ‚ÄúThese are our friends, and we want them to be happy!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up. ‚ÄúGetting laid makes me happy.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda smacked her on the leg and looked at Jen, who had an exasperated look on her face. ‚ÄúIgnoring this one, wear something comfortable. Where are you going?‚Äù She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThank you, Wanda,‚Äù Jen said, shooting Agatha an exasperated look. ‚ÄúAnd thank you for absolutely nothing, Agatha.‚Äù Agatha shrugged. She was not the person to go to for dating advice. Sex advice, absolutely. Dating, absolutely not. Jen continued, ‚ÄúLunch and a multi-cultural festival I wanted to go to that I mentioned a month or so back.‚Äù She responded with a slight smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda squealed, ‚ÄúShe listened and remembered! Okay, so comfortable shoes for walking, obviously, and then something comfortable for being outside in the heat. A sundress! Go with a sundress. Pink is your color, do that!‚Äù She was giddy and in her element. As much as she didn‚Äôt want her sons to grow up, she couldn‚Äôt wait to help them out with dates either.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget a hat so you don‚Äôt blind her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDid you even brush your hair today? The iconic hair that you‚Äôre supposed to take meticulous care of?‚Äù Jen responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDid you polish your head?‚Äù Agatha shot back. ‚ÄúAnd I do take care of my hair when necessary, thank you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWill you two stop it? Agatha, you're just jealous because there are so many rules and stipulations with your hair and how iconic it is. The times you have been able to do anything with it, even that was meticulously curated and written into contracts and insurance policies.‚Äù Wanda turned to Jen, ‚ÄúShe was in her late twenties and had to shave it for a role when she found out how terrible she looked bald. It took months just to greenlight the haircut and the movie. They almost had to get a body double just because it was taking so long.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am not jealous,‚Äù Agatha mumbled. Much like other celebrities had iconic features, hers had been her hair since she was a kid, to the point where, like Taylor Swift‚Äôs legs, Mariah Carey‚Äôs vocal cords, and America Ferrera‚Äôs smile were insured, so had been her hair. It hadn‚Äôt been her idea, and it still wasn‚Äôt her favorite thing in the world. However, it made sense business-wise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre also jealous because I have a date, and you don‚Äôt,‚Äù Jen added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, please. I could have any date I wanted.‚Äù She huffed, hating that they were teaming up against her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúStop it. Both of you.‚Äù Wanda warned, using her mom voice and glare. The other two women muttered as they changed the topic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       was
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      slightly annoyed that Alice and Jennifer had figured it out right after deciding to remain friends. What was worse was that she knew Rio had been the one to make the final push. She had reminded herself that she and Rio had just met. Agatha Harkness possessed many things. However, patience was not one of them. She didn‚Äôt want to screw things up, and Rio was extremely young. Agatha was not entirely sure where this was coming from, and knew that remaining friends was the best course of action. Clearly, she was letting Wanda and her other friends get to her, and she needed to focus on her career. She needed to devote her time to preparing for her commitments and promoting her upcoming projects.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew she was bored and that was all.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚Äú...football starts up in September, so we have that, and then the premiere for
     </span>
<em>
<span>

<span>
      in October.‚Äù Wanda looked over at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen perked up. ‚ÄúThis one has been promoted for months. There‚Äôs already award talk, as you both know. The theme song has been everywhere already.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda turned to Agatha with a wide grin, and Agatha could already see the wheels turning in her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou should take Rio,‚Äù Wanda said excitedly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, I know this is not one for Nicky to attend, but I thought we‚Äôd go together since we played opposite each other.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen held up a hand, eyes lighting up. ‚ÄúNo, Wanda‚Äôs on to something. Wanda, people have been wondering about you and Vision.‚Äù She gave her a pointed look as Wanda looked away. ‚ÄúSo you should probably walk the carpet with your husband. Unless you planned on walking it with someone else, that‚Äôs not Agatha?‚Äù Wanda shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRight. So, go with your husband, and Agatha, take Rio. We‚Äôre not doing fake dating or any publicity stunts like that, so no one goes down that road, but it will be nice for people to see that you have other friends. I‚Äôve been trying to get Alice to walk the carpet for years as the daughter of Lorna Wu, but she won‚Äôt touch it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha glared at both of them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it, and we‚Äôll circle back. How‚Äôs that?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it. Now, Jen, about your date tomorrow.‚Äù She wanted to change the subject as quickly as possible before this could turn back to her at all, just glad Nat wasn‚Äôt here.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice was nervous. It was Saturday, and she was finally going on a date with Jen. The events from the previous Tuesday continued to play in Alice‚Äôs head. She and Jen agreeing to be just friends, and Rio pushing Alice to call Jen an hour later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice had been so afraid Jen would say no, but instead, she said yes before Alice even finished speaking. Apparently, Jen‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking for anything serious‚Äù was more of a defense mechanism than anything. So here Alice was, in her closet, with Rio sitting on her bed, telling her what to wear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSeriously, Alice, she‚Äôs going to think you‚Äôre beautiful no matter what you wear. She‚Äôs absolutely into you.‚Äù She said, popping a chip into her mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt even know we liked each other,‚Äù Alice replied, holding a black shirt up to herself before making a face and replacing it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay, true, but I just met everyone, and anytime I see the two of you together, Agatha is there. You try paying attention to anyone else when Agatha Harkness is standing RIGHT THERE.‚Äù She gestured with her hand to make the point.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice pulled on a pair of black shorts, moving so that Rio could see how they looked. ‚ÄúI do it all the time. Almost a decade, Ri.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded her approval of the shorts as the other woman disappeared back into the closet. ‚ÄúI applaud your strength. Yes, the orange halter. It honestly is your color. She was also apparently very close with your mother, found that out last weekend, and I‚Äôm new to the friend group. The Converse, the plain black ones. I‚Äôm surprised you didn‚Äôt see her more when you were younger. ‚Äù She added. The more Rio was learning, the more hurt she was becoming. How much longer could she tell herself that Alice was just doing what was best? ‚ÄúWear your hair down, it‚Äôs so pretty like that. I‚Äôm so glad you didn‚Äôt do it all red.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice had never made dating a major priority in her life, and Rio wanted the best for her. The more Alice shared about Jen, the more it seemed like Jen would be a good fit for her. It helped that they had known each other for so long, and they already knew each other‚Äôs quirks and habits. Alice had been cautious of LA, anything to do with Hollywood, dating, and even drinking for a very long time. Rio had been the bad influence of the two. Anything that could take her down the path of Lorna Wu, she kept at arm‚Äôs length. Alice knew she had the same addictive personality as her mother did. She had to take things slowly and in moderation, integrating into the world of Hollywood, and wine nights, she was still careful with any type of medication, and with that, came dating.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy for you, Alice. It‚Äôs going to go great. If you need any help with dating advice, well, there‚Äôs maybe Wanda? She seems to have good luck in that department, just not in the decision-making aspect of it. If you want to find yourself in a horrible situation though, I‚Äôm your girl.‚Äù Rio gave her the thumbs up as Alice came out and closed the door, showing off the completed look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat was not your fault. You had no idea ANY of that was going to happen. Now, wish me luck, and text Agatha to see what she‚Äôs doing tonight.‚Äù Alice winked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed and hugged her tightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to work out. She‚Äôs already wrapped around you like that finger trap that got stuck on your finger when we were fifteen and drunk.‚Äù Rio whispered before she let Alice go and left to go back to her own apartment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt was Lunar New Year, we had too much sake, and it was made for toddlers!‚Äù Alice said after her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen drink some sake!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stared at her phone as she thought about texting Agatha. ‚ÄúFriends hang out with each other. If Alice wasn‚Äôt going out with Jen, we would do something tonight.‚Äù She said, looking over at the cat, who had jumped up on the couch with her.
     </span>

      She hesitated before sending it and looked over at Raven. ‚ÄúAlice won‚Äôt come back and want to go over everything, right? Surely they‚Äôll hang out all night, right?‚Äù Raven gave a soft meow before climbing into her lap. ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù She pressed send and automatically saw that Agatha was typing a response.

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked down at the phone. She hadn‚Äôt changed Agatha‚Äôs contact from what Alice and crew had entered, so the purple heart had stayed. She wondered what they had put in Agatha‚Äôs phone. She thought for a moment and looked down at Raven. ‚ÄúYou might meet a new friend today, old woman. Hopefully, you like her.‚Äù

      Rio placed her phone on the coffee table and stood up to make sure her apartment was tidied up. Rio kept it clean but didn‚Äôt want any dishes in the sink or accidental underwear on the floor. She scooped out the cat box, took out the trash, double-checked that the bathroom was clean, and all the usual ‚Äòsomeone other than my sister is coming over‚Äô chores were done. She looked in the fridge to see what she had on hand and decided on a chicken and bacon pasta from scratch. It was simple but with a homemade sauce, so somewhat impressive. She was wearing normal lazy Saturday clothes: black sweats and a green tank, with hair clipped up, and barefoot. She wasn‚Äôt going to bother changing as she saw no need. It wasn‚Äôt like she was trying to impress Agatha. She wasn‚Äôt. She fed Raven in hopes that she‚Äôd leave them alone while they ate, knowing full well that she wouldn‚Äôt. She already had music playing as she couldn‚Äôt stand silence and always had something playing. Currently, it was some random Spotify mix. She looked at her phone as it dinged, seeing a text from Alice.

      Agatha had packed a bag, not because she thought anything would happen, but because she wanted to be comfortable at Rio‚Äôs house. She was used to having to look a certain way when she was out during the day, which was why she wore jeans and a simple black top. Nice enough to be photographed if she were seen between the vehicle and Rio‚Äôs building. She had packed sweats and a UCLA shirt to change into later. She was glad Rio had texted her, although honestly, Agatha had been about ten minutes away from texting her new friend herself. It was the weekend before school started, and she wanted to spend time together before she was buried in work this week.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had sent her the address, though she already knew where she lived, having been to Alice‚Äôs plenty of times over the years. Her thoughts wandered to her friends in New York, wanting to check on them, but knowing it was best to leave them alone when they were on their own. Agatha sighed at the thought of Wanda and that whole‚Ä¶thing. She knew Wanda would always do what Wanda felt was best for the boys, and that she and Vision loved each other in their way. It was a messy situation, and she needed Wanda to hurry the hell up and fill Rio in so she had someone to talk to about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook the thoughts away as the elevator doors opened on Rio‚Äôs floor and walked to the door. She had been let into the building easily. The doormen were all the same and knew her, even if they hadn‚Äôt, no one told Agatha Harkness no. She was one of the most recognizable people in the world. She knocked and wasn‚Äôt surprised when the door opened almost immediately.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Rio said, standing aside to let her in. ‚ÄúMake yourself at home, put your bag wherever. What do you want to drink?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù She replied, not setting her bag down yet. Eyes landing on what looked like something fruity. ‚ÄúWhatever you‚Äôre drinking is fine, and where‚Äôs your bathroom? I want to change. I hate having to look put together all the time.‚Äù She grimaced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed. ‚ÄúI have a rum and pineapple, and there‚Äôs one down the hall on the right. I completely get it. I‚Äôm not ready to wear teacher clothes every day. I‚Äôll grab our food. We‚Äôre even eating at the table. Like adults!‚Äù She responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh goody!‚Äù She said sarcastically as she headed down the hall.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When she returned a few minutes later, she set her bag behind the couch and joined Rio at the table. ‚ÄúYou cook?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAlice and I both do. Gran made sure of it. I had taught myself growing up anyway, but Gran honed my skill.‚Äù She answered as they both started eating.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hummed in satisfaction, ‚ÄúYou did a great job. I do okay, but this is amazing. If that whole teaching thing doesn‚Äôt pan out, you‚Äôve got a backup skill to fall back on.‚Äù Agatha downplayed her own skills. She had been taught to cook by two women who believed that she should know how to cook for herself. One of those people had learned from the same person Rio had.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs cheeks tinged a light pink. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the first one to say that.‚Äù Her eyes darted to Agatha‚Äôs feet. ‚ÄúI apologize if Raven tries to steal your food.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúThe cat? I haven‚Äôt even‚Ä¶‚Äù She was cut off by a feline intruder jumping into her lap. ‚Äú...and you must be Raven. Sorry, but I am not sharing with you.‚Äù She said as she put her fork down and removed the cat from her lap, only for Raven to jump into the other empty lap and be dismissed for a second time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. ‚ÄúI promise I feed her, do not listen to her lies.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen a cat beg for human food before,‚Äù Agatha remarked, watching as the cat sat between the two chairs, green eyes watching them both.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs not a cat, as I said before, that is an immortal familiar.‚Äù Rio finished her food, putting her fork down, watching Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her and down at her plate. ‚ÄúDo you even taste your food? We‚Äôve been sitting for five minutes.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat was me tasting my food and eating slowly.‚Äù She replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head and gestured ahead with her fork. ‚ÄúWell, do continue about Raven.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAlice and I adopted her when we got our first place in college. Alice is more of a dog person, but she humored me. We were at the shelter, about to adopt another cat, when a kitten was meowing incessantly. Suddenly, this mostly black paw shot out of the adjacent kennel, attempting to smack the kitten to get it to stop, and all we saw were these shiny green eyes. I swear to this day that cat was not there. The shelter didn‚Äôt even have the paperwork for her and made up some random name, and I‚Äôm pretty sure falsified information when we decided that we obviously had to have the magical mystery cat. That was nearly sixteen years ago. They guessed she was around two, though not a single vet has been able to age her properly. On paper, she‚Äôs eighteen, but in reality? No idea. In my heart? At least a thousand.‚Äù Rio smiled affectionately at the aged feline, now more brown and orange than black as she once had been. She turned her attention back to Agatha, passion in her voice as she continued speaking about her cat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShortly after Norma died, when Alice moved out here and I moved to a different place of my own for the first time, Raven disappeared for six weeks. I thought she was gone, that I had lost her, too.‚Äù Rio‚Äôs smile faltered, something dark sliding over her eyes before it left just as quickly as it had appeared. ‚ÄúThankfully, she returned without a scratch, no parasites, nothing. A little thin and in need of a bath, which she hated. The vet was mystified. I‚Äôve also seen her chase off predators, hunt things much bigger than her, all kinds of unusual things. She‚Äôs basically a friend-shaped Eldritch creature.‚Äù Raven now perched in Rio‚Äôs lap, eyeing Agatha, as Rio absentmindedly scratched her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at the animal, having finished her dinner, and now leaned forward with her chin propped on her fist. ‚ÄúYou are one interesting cat.‚Äù She noted, as the cat in question judged her. She turned back to Rio. ‚ÄúWhy do I feel like she‚Äôs staring into my soul?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBecause she is. Seconds?‚Äù Rio stood and took their plates.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, thank you. That was great. Let me help.‚Äù Agatha stood, collected their empty glasses, and followed Rio into the kitchen. As she helped clean up, she noticed how intently Raven watched her. Agatha had never felt judged by a cat before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI feel like she‚Äôs sizing me up.‚Äù Agatha finally said as they finished cleaning up, putting leftovers away, and refreshing their drinks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe does that.‚Äù Was all Rio said as she walked back to the living room, and they both sat on the couch. ‚ÄúHave you told anyone that I‚Äôm going to the beach house yet?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, have you?‚Äù Agatha turned toward Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo. No particular reason. I just haven‚Äôt shared it with Alice yet. She‚Äôs been so excited about this date, and I keep forgetting.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, Jen has been, too, and Wanda, of course.‚Äù Agatha shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMovie?‚Äù Rio asked, changing the subject before asking questions she knew Agatha would not give her the answers to. She tried to think of a movie that wasn‚Äôt an Agatha or Wanda film, she was in the mood to watch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes. Want to watch one we‚Äôve probably both seen a million times and make commentary?‚Äù Agatha asked with a sly grin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of my favorite things to do.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIf we can find one, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve seen that many black and white movies.‚Äù Rio joked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hit her with a pillow, smirking at the ‚ÄòLive Laugh Lesbian‚Äô saying. ‚ÄúWe can watch another Disney or PG one, child.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked to the ceiling and poked her tongue into the side of her cheek. ‚ÄúOkay, point taken. What about the lesbian classic D.E.B.S?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe extremely cheesy spy thriller with a killer 80s soundtrack?‚Äù Agatha asked with a knowing smirk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe one and only,‚Äù Rio answered, already searching through her various subscription services for the movie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, absolutely, but only if we turn it into a sing-along.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They shared sarcastic comments and sang along with exaggerated movements, noting the various tropes of the movie. Agatha pointed out different people she knew, including those she
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       knew.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow do you even keep track, or remember?‚Äù Rio shook her head, laughing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúA gentle sapphic never forgets, lest she repeats.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio scoffed. ‚ÄúHow many little black books do you have?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúA small library full,‚Äù Agatha winked at Rio scandalously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes and shook her head again, saying nothing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs face softened as the credits began to roll. ‚ÄúDoes it bother you?‚Äù Her voice was softer now, quieter. Agatha was not ashamed of her decades of conquests and dalliances. It was part of who she was, and it was widely known. Yet she found herself somewhat self-conscious of it for the first time since she was thirteen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tilted her head to the side and thought about it. This was Agatha Harkness. Quite possibly the most respectful ‚Äòplayboy‚Äô to roam the Earth. She knew women who had
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       encountered
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      her. You couldn‚Äôt live in the state of California and not know at least one. Agatha was legendary in terms of respect, boundaries, and aftercare. She wasn‚Äôt going to call you back, and lightning never struck twice, but for someone with her reputation, it was a respectful one.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo. It would if you were arrogant in the way men are, or if there were rumors of you treating women horribly, but no. Besides, everyone has hobbies.‚Äù Rio gestured around her apartment at her plants.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For some reason, Rio Vidal‚Äôs approval was the validation that Agatha needed at that moment. Not that it mattered, it‚Äôs not like they would ever be doing anything. Rio was a friend, not food.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had only really sought the validation of five people in her life, not counting the public as a whole. Two of those people were dead, one was no longer in her life, one was a middle-aged redhead, and the other was a teenage boy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      None of them were Rio Vidal, yet here she was, overcome with warmth from knowing that the beautiful,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       friend
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , woman next to her, did not see her as less than, or a horrible person for her choice of extracurricular activities.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The next movie started automatically while they talked and laughed late into the night. Rio looked over at Agatha when the older woman‚Äôs voice cut off mid-sentence to see that she had fallen asleep. Rio looked at her for a moment, taking in Agatha‚Äôs sleeping form, now in sweats and an oversized UCLA t-shirt. It was a deep-set couch, one that Rio had spent many nights on when her bed felt too big and empty. She glanced toward her room and back to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had a decision to make. She groaned as she stood and stretched. She glanced down at Agatha and again in the direction of her room as she tidied the living room and turned off any remaining lights.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio went to her bathroom and brushed her teeth, trying not to think about Agatha sound asleep on her couch. The couch that could, in theory, safely fit both of them. Innocently, as friends. She walked back through her room and picked up a blanket to drape over her sleeping friend as she cast a cynical look at her bed. ‚ÄúOh, what, like you have any room to judge. You‚Äôre not comforting.‚Äù She scoffed at the offending piece of furniture as she went back to the couch, having decided on her fate.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio curled up in a ball opposite Agatha and draped the blanket over them. They weren‚Äôt cuddling, they weren‚Äôt even touching‚Äîjust two friends who had fallen asleep on the same piece of furniture together. Rio had a feeling this was a normal occurrence in this co-dependent coven. She settled in, whispered goodnight, and went to sleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Raven hopped up on the couch and weighed her options before climbing on top of Agatha and falling asleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For the second Sunday morning in a row, the early morning sunlight filtered in and gently cast its light across Rio and Agatha, this time asleep on the same couch, legs intertwined.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice burst through the door barefoot, hair askew,¬† wearing nothing but an orange sports bra and Garfield boxers. She pounced on Rio and planted a giant kiss on her cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI love you and am forever indebted to you. Good morning, Aggie.‚Äù Alice grinned, quickly disappearing. ‚ÄúEnjoy your morning!‚Äù She called as the door shut behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was still half asleep, but mumbled. ‚ÄúWas that her thanking you because they fucked?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sleepily shook her head. ‚ÄúNo. Knowing my sister, they decided to date, finally kissed, Jen spent the night, and they woke up holding each other. Lesbians. It was her thank you for that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù Agatha clicked her tongue, eyes still closed. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to text their group chat about this, isn‚Äôt she?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYep,‚Äù Rio popped the p, shifting under the covers. ‚ÄúWanda will be insufferable this week.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going back to sleep.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn‚Äôt until after Agatha had left and Alice had come over to tell Rio about her date that Rio finally let herself process last night‚Äôs sleeping situation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOur legs were all wrapped together, Alice!‚Äù Rio exclaimed, making some complicated motions using both arms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôve slept like that, no big deal,‚Äù Alice shrugged as she put the final touches on a seating chart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, but you‚Äôre my sister, and while gorgeous, you‚Äôre not Mother Harkness,‚Äù Rio referred to Agatha by her Instagram handle and what she was commonly referred to by the lesbian community.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice didn‚Äôt take offense as she knew exactly what Rio meant. ‚ÄúKnew you still had that crush, Ms. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre just friends‚Äô. Besides, you‚Äôre the one who made the very conscious decision to sleep on the couch.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe are just friends, which might complicate things. I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have told you I chose to sleep on the couch.‚Äù She grimaced. ‚ÄúNo, she‚Äôs the parent of a student.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre both tactile and you like to cuddle. It‚Äôs cute, even if you don‚Äôt end up together. You have another platonic cuddle buddy.‚Äù Alice tried to spin it in a positive light.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just sighed. ‚ÄúMeanwhile, you‚Äôve found yourself a whole-ass wife,‚Äù she grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo one said anything about any of that.‚Äù Alice glared back. ‚ÄúWe are taking things slow, still painfully so. We are officially dating though, and it‚Äôs about fucking time.‚Äù Their whole relationship had been based on caution, why not remain at that speed? Alice sighed. At this rate, Agatha and Rio would be grandparents, and Wanda would figure out her life by the time she and Jen even moved in together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had been waiting for Wanda to return from her trip. Agatha had told Wanda that she was to come to Agatha‚Äôs immediately.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had just finished her fourth set of Pilates when the non-lethal redhead finally came in the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI had Nat take my stuff to the house. What‚Äôs wrong? You wouldn‚Äôt tell me, is everything okay?‚Äù Wanda asked, eyes searching the older woman‚Äôs face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe fell asleep on the couch, our legs were all,‚Äù she gestured with her arms to mimic their legs, ‚Äúwhen we woke up, and it just felt natural. I don‚Äôt cuddle with just anyone.‚Äù Agatha plopped on the couch, running out of energy, as the words flowed forth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda tried to control her excitement and not overreact. Agatha was right. She didn‚Äôt spend the night with people. She was tactile with very few, the core group being it, and even then, mainly Wanda. ‚ÄúHow did Rio react?‚Äù She asked cautiously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shrugged. ‚ÄúWe both acted like nothing happened.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda mimicked Agatha‚Äôs plop and looked over at her. ‚ÄúA bunch of useless lesbians, I swear.‚Äù She sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe worst.‚Äù Agatha agreed. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fun, attractive, smart, I can tell her anything.‚Äù She shook her head. ‚ÄúBut, no. I will not be dating my son‚Äôs teachers...anymore.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat a great time to up your standards,‚Äù Wanda remarked. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       date
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      them in the first place, nor do you date. You won‚Äôt even mention how you‚Äôre feeling about the intimacy of it all.‚Äù She studied Agatha‚Äôs face for any signs of how she felt, and while she saw a few twitches, Agatha‚Äôs multitudes of awards weren‚Äôt for nothing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Where Wanda had to put forth the effort to keep her emotions from being written all over her face, Agatha had been born with a resting bitch face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI will not be doing that at this moment. We are friends and nothing more.‚Äù Agatha replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shook her head. After nearly three decades with Agatha, this didn‚Äôt surprise her. ‚ÄúDo you need a shovel to bury those feelings?‚Äù She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha scoffed. ‚ÄúCan I borrow yours?‚Äù She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI hate you.‚Äù Wanda smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou love me,‚Äù Agatha responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>

<p>
<span>
      The first day of school started with a school-wide meeting before students arrived. Lilia looked at the faculty and staff and reminded everyone, once again, of the NDAs that had been signed, their unusual student body and parents, the school‚Äôs mission, and so forth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was beginning to detest the term.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIn conclusion,‚Äù Lilia had said, ‚Äúwe are not just working with parents, but nannies, managers, agents, PR, etc. You will develop all types of
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       relationships.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      We are all adults here, and we sign NDAs for a reason. I have eyes and ears everywhere. I know what goes on. Act like adults and keep things out of the public eye, or at least let the reps handle it how they need to. Think logically and do not involve students in their parents‚Äô affairs. While a few relationships have worked out successfully in the past, many have not. Be mindful of that.‚Äù She dismissed them all to get ready for the students to show up. It was the same speech every year, though it hit harder this year for a large population of the faculty.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia pulled Alice aside with a knowing smile. ‚ÄúRemember what I‚Äôve told you, while Jen‚Äôs not a parent, it could still affect things. I‚Äôm happy for you, but you are both hard-headed and stubborn.‚Äù She squeezed Alice‚Äôs arm and walked toward where Rio spoke with another science teacher.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia pulled Rio aside, a hand on her shoulder, ‚ÄúMay and December are not that much different,‚Äù then the older woman walked away without another word.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat the fuck does that mean?‚Äù Rio asked as Alice came up beside her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand half of what that woman says, and I‚Äôve been here for ten years,‚Äù Alice replied. ‚ÄúOh well, off to start the day.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh! Alice, I forgot to tell you. I‚Äôm going with you to the beach weekend! Happy first day of school!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was easily the most excited about Rio joining them for the upcoming holiday weekend. However, she was also perplexed as she sat in her living room the last week of August with Jen and Nat. Alice and Rio were teaching, and Agatha was at a press interview.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSix bedrooms at the beach house. The boys will have the bunkroom, which isn‚Äôt a bunkroom anymore, but they‚Äôll want to all stay together. Vision and I.‚Äù Her eyes darted down as she said it, hands fidgeting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had been looking at her phone, but Nat caught her look and lightly brushed her fingertips down her arm in comfort, eliciting a tense smile from Wanda before she continued her bedroom planning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNat, you have your room. Jen, do you and Alice want to share a room?‚Äù She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen‚Äôs eyes shot up. ‚ÄúUmm, we‚Äôre not..but yes.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda‚Äôs smile widened slightly, happy someone had figured it out at least. ‚ÄúFinally. That leaves Agatha in her room and‚Ä¶damn, that‚Äôs just enough rooms with no way to force her and Rio to share a room.‚Äù Wanda had been hoping to force Rio and Agatha to room together, but unfortunately, she and Agatha had bought a large house all those years ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen shrugged. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve had four movie nights, we‚Äôve been present at two of them, and they usually end up falling asleep in the same room or on each other anyway. They‚Äôre comfortable together and have barely known each other for a month.‚Äù She reminded her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs like a year in lesbian time!‚Äù Wanda whined.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat fully put her hand on Wanda‚Äôs arm, looking at her softly. That look conveyed more than Nat‚Äôs words did. ‚ÄúI know you want Aggie to find someone, but give it a bit more time, okay?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. Jen looked from Nat to Wanda and back. ‚ÄúIf you try to force Agatha too much, she‚Äôll rebel,‚Äù Jen added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI agree with Jen,‚Äù Nat stared at Wanda. ‚ÄúYou know she‚Äôs right.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. ‚ÄúFine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll stop nudging.‚Äù She chewed on her lip and looked at Nat. ‚ÄúI want her to have‚Ä¶to be‚Ä¶‚Äù She whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen watched the interaction between Wanda and Nat carefully. Wanda was quickly spiraling, and Jen knew it was only a matter of time. She jotted down a few notes and sighed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to head to the office. I have a few contract negotiations to handle. Have a good afternoon.‚Äù She waved and left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Upon hearing the door click behind Jen, Nat pulled Wanda into her, an arm around her waist. Wanda laid her head on Nat‚Äôs shoulder, eyes darting to the clock to gauge how much time they had. Nat pressed her lips to Wanda‚Äôs temple.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTalk to me dragostea mea, my love,‚Äù Nat whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda relaxed into Nat, careful to watch the time. Always aware of the time. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this, Natasha. Something has to change, and I still don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù Her fingers drew circles on Nat‚Äôs arm as she tried to keep her breathing steady. This was not a new conversation for them, and it was becoming more frequent.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat caressed Wanda‚Äôs cheek, her brows furrowed. Nat would always respect Wanda‚Äôs decisions, even if they did rip at her heart. ‚ÄúHave you talked to Agatha? Told her where you‚Äôre at?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shook her head. ‚ÄúYou know what she would say, and my therapist isn‚Äôt helpful, and no, I haven‚Äôt talked to anyone else. Everyone‚Äôs too close to us, Nat. They will all say the same thing.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat knew they would. She was selfishly counting on it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat curled her index finger under Wanda‚Äôs chin and tilted it up, their eyes meeting. ‚ÄúSunshine, I‚Ä¶‚Äù She was cut off when they heard the front door open, and they flew apart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAfternoon, Darling!‚Äù Vision called, ruining the moment.
     </span>

      The first few weeks of school had gone well. Rio was getting to know her students well and building relationships with them and the other parents. So far, no shenanigans had been started by Nicky or Tommy, and Billy was a great kid. Labor Day weekend had finally arrived, and she was excited to go on this little trip with her friends, something she hadn‚Äôt had with any of her friends in San Francisco. She enjoyed their weekend movie nights, no matter who joined, dinners with Alice during the week, and Jennifer, who was starting to dine with them too. Rio knew that this weekend at the Wagatha beach house was going to be both memorable and fun. They were all headed up to Malibu that evening and would return Monday afternoon.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the final bell rang, Rio grabbed her things and met Alice in the hall as they walked towards her car, as it had been Rio‚Äôs week to drive.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you excited to stay in the massive beach house all weekend?‚Äù Alice asked, knocking her shoulder into Rio‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm excited about. I‚Äôm excited to spend time with this forged family you‚Äôve roped me into.‚Äù Rio responded with a grin. It was true. That‚Äôs what this felt like.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She and Alice had always been family, but she was happy it had expanded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice smiled back. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always a fun weekend. You‚Äôre going to love it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They stopped by the apartment to change and load the car. Rio set everything out for Raven, who was being taken care of by Morgan Stark, Pepper, and Tony‚Äôs daughter. Though she didn‚Äôt know Morgan all that well yet, Agatha had said that she was very trustworthy, even if Tony was her father. There was apparently history there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio trusted Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRaven, be good for Morgan, okay?‚Äù Raven yawned in return.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they drove toward Malibu, Rio scrolled through socials and noticed several posts on Agatha‚Äôs subreddit mentioning how no one had seen her out. She closed out of Reddit and opened her music app.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIs it weird that Agatha hasn‚Äôt been out and about? She hasn‚Äôt gone out partying, hasn‚Äôt been seen making poor decisions, none of the normal Agatha Harkness behavior.‚Äù Rio asked casually as she scrolled through the ‚ÄòBeach Weekend‚Äô playlist she had made.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shrugged. ‚ÄúShe goes through periods, especially as Nicky gets older. Maybe she‚Äôs deciding to tone it down, finally. Or she‚Äôs just gone through all of Hollywood and doesn‚Äôt want to corrupt all of the newer talent.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I know it hasn‚Äôt been that long, but Reddit is noticing, and it won‚Äôt be long before the rest of social media and the media in general start picking up on it soon.‚Äù Rio mused. No, it wasn‚Äôt odd for people to change, but Agatha had been the same for decades.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      However, the more Rio learned about Agatha over the past few weeks, the more she saw her for who she was. This would be a major public persona change, and people would notice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While it didn‚Äôt bother Rio, she noticed the change.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice was quick to change the subject. ‚ÄúJen and I are sharing a room.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course you are. I‚Äôd be more surprised if you weren‚Äôt.‚Äù Rio responded with a smile. ‚ÄúJust, don‚Äôt be too loud.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPlease. We are not there yet.‚Äù Not that she didn‚Äôt want to be, but they weren‚Äôt rushing anything, especially not at beach weekend. It was like having sex while on vacation with your parents.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhatever you say. You‚Äôre already going painfully slow for lesbians.‚Äù Rio reminded her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre not? At this point, Jen and I should have kids, you and Agatha should have U-Hauled, and Nat and Wanda...well. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAm I the ONLY PERSON that doesn‚Äôt know that story?‚Äù She asked, frustrated. ‚ÄúI mean, obviously, something is going on. I am a lesbian with eyes.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNat, Wanda, and Agatha are the only ones who know everything,‚Äù Alice looked over at Rio for a moment as she continued down the highway. ‚ÄúThe boys have no idea, I don‚Äôt think. I‚Äôm not sure how much Vision really knows. If it‚Äôs just that his wife isn‚Äôt completely honest with him, or if there‚Äôs an unspoken agreement. Jen and I don‚Äôt know everything, just what we‚Äôve seen. There‚Äôs something there, though. I think the whole Wagatha thing is to keep the public from figuring out what‚Äôs truly going on.‚Äù Alice shook her head, a slightly sad expression on her face. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll share when they‚Äôre ready if they ever are. For now, Nat protects both of them, and they all have a dynamic that works,‚Äù she finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio pouted a bit before letting out a resigned sigh. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs starting to make sense why Wanda is so invested in wanting everyone else around her to be happy when she clearly isn‚Äôt.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Dinner had been eaten, rooms sorted, and luggage settled. They were on the beach around a bonfire. Tommy and Nicky were throwing a football around; Vision, Billy, Nat, and Wanda were pointing out stars and constellations to each other; Alice and Jen were catching each other up on the week, and Rio was taking it all in. Agatha came up next to her and handed her a bottle of some mixed alcohol, and sat next to her. Agatha wore shorts over a swimsuit with her hair down. Rio, dressed similarly, nodded her thanks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Without thinking, Rio automatically remarked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed your weekends haven‚Äôt exactly been your usual style recently.‚Äù She flinched as she said it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just gave a wry smile. ‚ÄúEven Hollywood bad boys are allowed to take a break. Besides, Jen needed a break. She was about to have a stroke spinning everything and cleaning up my messes.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚ÄúI can only imagine. The woman could be a fixer for the mafia at this point.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that bad,‚Äù Agatha responded with a huff.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDepending on which website you read.‚Äù Rio smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhich ones are you reading?‚Äù Agatha asked, meeting Rio‚Äôs eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Brown eyes met blue, really seeing Agatha. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe everything I read.‚Äù She replied softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh? And what do you believe?‚Äù Agatha asked, the noise around her fading. All she was focused on was Rio‚Äôs answer. Sometime in the last month, this woman‚Äôs opinion had become almost as important to her as Wanda‚Äôs. It was something she couldn‚Äôt quite put into words yet, but the gravity of it was not lost on her. She had stopped truly caring about what the public thought of her personal life, relationship-wise, years ago. Yet here she was staring into the eyes of this younger woman who had captivated her since the moment they‚Äôd been re-introduced, hanging on her every word, finding that the next few minutes were either going to destroy her or give her a hope that she hadn‚Äôt had in decades.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI see you, Agatha,‚Äù Rio responded and was about to continue when a shout interrupted the moment as a redhead crashed into them, catching a rogue football.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha swore. She could murder her son.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSorry, Mom! Sorry, Rio!‚Äù Nicky shouted. They had all agreed that the boys could call Rio by her first name when they weren‚Äôt at school, just like they did with Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat rolled off both of them. ‚ÄúSorry. I didn‚Äôt think either of you wanted a black eye.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThere are worse ways to go than death by redhead, Natasha. It‚Äôs fine.‚Äù Rio replied, standing up, her drink spilled all over her, and the moment was lost. ‚ÄúThank you for the save.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had fixed the expression on her face and mumbled her thanks as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to go shower and head to bed,‚Äù Agatha said, standing and heading off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Several others also took that moment to excuse themselves and call it a night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what she had been about to say, but she had done a lot of thinking about this
     </span>
<span>
      developing friendship and Agatha herself
     </span>
<span>
      in the past few weeks, telling herself that Agatha‚Äôs behavioral changes had absolutely nothing to do with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Returning to her assigned guest room, Rio readied herself for bed. She showered and lay down in the luxuriously comfortable bed, alone.¬† It shouldn‚Äôt have bothered her, but she knew what the odd energetic feeling in her chest was.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       It‚Äôs just a crush,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      she told herself.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Nothing to get that worked up over, and nothing to be done about.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I don‚Äôt date parents,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      her thoughts continued as she let sleep overcome her,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       even if they‚Äôre her‚Ä¶

      This thing is evolving, a lot, thanks brain! While Agatha and Rio remain the main relationship, the Wandanat of it all is going to be explored more as well.

       Labor Day Weekend
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was early. The sun had yet to rise, and the two redheads were only up because they had gone for a run on the beach,
     </span>
<span>
      their daily runs something they had established when they were eighteen
     </span>
<span>
      . They sat on one of the back decks looking out over the ocean, drinking coffee and enjoying the cool morning breeze. Wanda enjoyed these mornings with Natasha when they could be alone. Their chairs were pushed together, and they knew no one else would be up for at least another hour. They still wouldn‚Äôt risk it and would part ways to shower shortly after finishing their coffee, but they enjoyed the fleeting moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda held Nat‚Äôs hand and ran her thumb over her knuckles. She was careful, knowing that her husband and sons were in the house behind them.
     </span>
<span>
      She wasn‚Äôt worried so much about Vision. It was the boys.
     </span>
<span>
      She sighed as she dropped the other woman‚Äôs hand and wrapped it around her coffee mug. ‚ÄúJen and Alice have gotten their shit together, it seems.‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      Wanda let her native accent slip through.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded. ‚ÄúThanks to Rio for giving the final push. That only took
     </span>
<span>
      ten
     </span>
<span>
      years.‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      She set her empty mug down and placed her hand on Wanda‚Äôs thigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded, ‚ÄúNow for the other two. What else can we do? How can we get them into a one-bed situation? Stranded? Forced proximity? Jen already nixed fake dating.‚Äù She rattled off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we just give it time, sunshine? They‚Äôre just getting to know each other and are already draw
     </span>
<span>
      n to each other. It‚Äôs going to work out.‚Äù Nat replied. She felt bad for breaking up their moment last night, and at least wanted to back off for the weekend.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIf I can‚Äôt be completely happy, everyone else is going to be, fuck.‚Äù Wanda bit back, bitterly, fire in her eyes. The more time passed, the worse things got for her situation, it seemed. No amount of stardom, therapy, or money could fix that. She had traded her soul and happiness for this life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Nat knew Wanda
     </span>
<span>
      was unraveling, and until Wanda made a decision, it was better to validate and change the subject.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou fixed the football schedule to where they‚Äôre working the concession stand together for a quarter of each home game, Jen will make it so Rio goes to the premiere as her date, we
     </span>
<span>
      won‚Äôt always be at movie nights
     </span>
<span>
      , you‚Äôre going to plant it in Agatha‚Äôs head to take Rio to SNL when she hosts, AND the Halloween party. That‚Äôs a lot of forced proximity.‚Äù She pointed out, her own accent rather prominent. Dropping their American accents around each other was something they had been doing
     </span>
<span>
      since they were teenagers
     </span>
<span>
      , another layer of intimacy between them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Their accents would slip through occasionally with the others, but not like this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. ‚ÄúI know. I‚Äôm just worried that we‚Äôre going to be traveling a lot soon, and they won‚Äôt be together as much.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A grin formed on the former assassin's lips as she turned to look at Wanda. ‚ÄúThen you either get Agatha to send her flowers, or you do it. Or plants, we know Rio has a green thumb. Talk to Alice. You also make sure she‚Äôs calling, texting, whatever, daily. Since Rio is here now, that means we have Alice and Rio join us for the holidays, and if, for some idiot reason, they STILL aren‚Äôt together by winter, we send them up to the cabin together, and all make excuses as to why the rest of us can‚Äôt go. Manifest a blizzard. Oh! Rio loves music! Get Agatha to take her to some concerts, pull some strings. You‚Äôre crafty, Wanda.
     </span>
<span>
      We‚Äôll figure it out, together, like we always do.
     </span>
<span>
      I‚Äôm going to shower
     </span>
<span>
      before everyone wakes up.‚Äù Nat stood and kissed Wanda on the crown of her head, deliberately ignoring the cameras on the perimeter of the house, before walking inside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda closed her eyes and sighed as she went to take their cups inside and get ready for the day herself, focusing on the plan she had previously come up with.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As everyone else woke up for the day, they gathered in the kitchen, various adults making breakfast. Vision and the boys would be taking the boat out to go fishing, Wanda decided that she, Nat, Jen, and Alice would go into town, and she suggested that Rio and Agatha remain at the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy, exactly, should we stay at the house?‚Äù Agatha asked, eyebrows high on her forehead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSomeone needs to stay here in case something happens to us on the boat. Someone always stays back.‚Äù Vision piped up as he loaded a cooler. He knew his wife well and
     </span>
<span>
      knew when she was meddling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha glanced over at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you have someone going with you, we have a guy at the house, and what the actual Coast Guard is for.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI would prefer to stay at the house, but you don‚Äôt have to stay with me. I have been told that I‚Äôm an adult.‚Äù Rio said, poking her tongue in her cheek absentmindedly as she leaned against the kitchen island, drinking her coffee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha almost immediately changed her mind, but she didn‚Äôt want to give Wanda the satisfaction. ‚ÄúI guess I can stay, but only because I don‚Äôt want to be on the pier on the last weekend of summer,‚Äù Agatha huffed and rolled her eyes, acting annoyed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs settled then!‚Äù Wanda clapped her hands together. ‚ÄúEveryone disperse!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision and the boys left shortly after, and the four women headed into Malibu. Rio and Agatha changed into swimwear. Then, Rio grabbed her beach bag, waving at Agatha as she went down to the private beach.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had a decision to make. Stay poolside or go down to the beach with Rio, and one sounded much more inviting than the other, which is how she found herself moments later sitting under the large beach umbrella where they had sat that first night at the party roughly a month ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled as she turned a page of the book she was reading. ‚ÄúCareful, Agatha, Wanda might think her meddling is working.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWanda needs to worry about her own shit. She won‚Äôt, but she needs to,‚Äù Agatha said as she situated herself and looked over at her companion for the day. They both had on sunglasses.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Probably for the best.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She smirked to herself. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you reading?‚Äù Agatha asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLesbian smut,‚Äù Rio responded, face deadpan, her eyes cutting to the side to see Agatha‚Äôs reaction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sucked in a breath. ‚ÄúGood smut, I hope.‚Äù She replied, side-eyeing her friend as well.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Fuck Harkness. FRIENDS. Stop trying to get in her bikini bottoms, s
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      he thought to herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know what I‚Äôll be doing later.‚Äù Rio teased.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Fuck, Vidal. You‚Äôre just FRIENDS. Stop flirting. You know where this leads.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Her inner alarm went off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Thankfully, Agatha barely caught herself before making any slightly embarrassing sounds and quickly changed the subject. ‚ÄúSO, the first football game is coming up‚Ä¶‚Äù She said, face red.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took the cue as they went back to safer territory. ‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôre working concessions together on Friday. Wanda‚Äôs doing, I‚Äôm sure. We‚Äôre working all the home games together.‚Äù She knew that was all Wanda and Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew it, too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe means well,‚Äù Agatha replied. ‚ÄúShe wants to see me, and everyone around her, happy. She throws herself into her work, her kids, her friends, and the school. Anything and everything she can.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúEveryone except herself? She does realize that you, her best friend and sister, are gay and living your best life, right?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAm I?‚Äù Agatha asked. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs still worried about how it would affect everything she‚Äôs built. Once I hit 16, I built my career on being America‚Äôs Lesbian Sweetheart. She was America‚Äôs
     </span>
<span>
      Imported
     </span>
<span>
      Straight Sweetheart.
     </span>
<span>
      The girl-next-door,
     </span>
<span>
      ‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha sighed
     </span>
<span>
      . ‚ÄúNope. Not my story to tell,
     </span>
<span>
      even though I was there
     </span>
<span>
      . Wanda wants the best for me, and by extension, you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled. ‚ÄúWell, so far, I have gained what feels like an entire family, and I don‚Äôt feel weird and starstruck around the two of you anymore. It does suck that Nat‚Äôs off-limits though. She‚Äôs hot.‚Äù She shot Agatha a devilish grin as Agatha rolled her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not off limits, but she refuses to date. Wanda would
     </span>
<span>
      make sure we never found your body, though.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded solemnly, ‚ÄúI believe
     </span>
<span>
      it.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed. ‚ÄúThat woman is feisty, and we have had a lot of training over the years.‚Äù She looked out at the ocean and back at Rio. ‚ÄúGoing back to concession duty for football games. How do you feel about having to serve hot dogs?‚Äù She asked, already plotting something.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wrinkled her nose. ‚ÄúEww. I‚Äôd rather not.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha jumped to her feet and shed her shorts and sunglasses. ‚ÄúThe last one waist-deep in the ocean, is on hot dog duty.‚Äù As she darted off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNOT FAIR HARKNESS!‚Äù Rio shouted as she scrambled to her feet and chased after her, taking her shorts and glasses off as she ran.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hit the water first and turned around to watch Rio, feeling the refreshingly cold water hit her skin as she slowly walked backward to let the younger woman catch up a bit. Agatha could admit she had played dirty, but that‚Äôs how she liked it. ‚ÄúCome on, kid! You can do better than that!‚Äù She shouted over the waves, turning back around. She was only knee-deep, and Rio was catching up. The water was up to her thighs when Rio jumped on her back, and they both went down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha yelped as she hit her knees and got a mouthful of saltwater. Rio was still wrapped around her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI AM VICTORIOUS!‚Äù Rio cried as Agatha spat out the ocean water.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned back laughing, dunking Rio in the ocean. Rio tightened her grip around her neck and took Agatha down with her as they both went under the water and rolled over. Rio finally unwrapped herself from Agatha, and they came back up, sputtering and laughing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTechnically, I hit the water first. I win,‚Äù Agatha said, continuing to cough up water and laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOnly because you cheated, bitch.‚Äù Rio responded, splashing water up at the other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, is that how we‚Äôre playing this now?‚Äù Agatha teased as she splashed back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The two women splashed and chased each other, reliving a childhood neither really had. They were closer to the shore when Agatha pounced on Rio. This time, it was Rio who yelped in surprise and went down. They rolled in the water for the second time, coming to a stop with Rio on top of Agatha. Rio was straddling her hips, hands on either side of her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTruce?‚Äù Rio asked, keeping her pinned down, grinning madly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTruce!‚Äù Agatha laughed. The water was shallow enough that it wasn‚Äôt going over her face, but her hair floated a bit around her. ‚ÄúWe'll make whoever is working with us do hot dogs.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù Rio replied softly. It was then that Rio realized their positioning but didn‚Äôt immediately move. She studied Agatha‚Äôs face, and her gaze fell to her lips.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       This would be the perfect moment. Nope. Parent. Danger Will Robinson. Abort. Remove self. Rise. Move.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She didn‚Äôt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up, searching Rio‚Äôs eyes and seeing the conflict happening. She knew she should make some snide remark and push Rio off her. Splash her. Ruin the moment. SOMETHING. This was dangerous. But instead, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre perfect,‚Äù escaped in a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was a long moment before Rio‚Äôs body finally responded to her brain. She stood up, shattering the moment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry. Are you hungry? We should eat something.‚Äù The whisper still echoing in her ears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha closed her mouth, still ajar in shock at her own declaration, and sat up, shaking her head to clear it. ‚ÄúYes, good idea. I also need to wash the sand and ocean out of my hair.
     </span>
<span>
      Have to take care of it or Jen will kill me.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio held out her hand to help her up. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs true then, and not just made up? Your hair really is insured?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the real amount? I‚Äôve seen everything from one million to one billion,‚Äù Rio inquired out of curiosity as Agatha took her hand and stood, the two immediately putting a few feet in between themselves.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTwenty million with various stipulations for maintenance, coloring, that kind of thing. I cut it on a whim without permission when I was sixteen, the smallest piece. Thankfully, it was 1989, and not everything was so monitored. I was due for maintenance anyway,‚Äù Agatha shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAnd the locket?‚Äù Rio asked. ‚ÄúI heard that was insured too, which makes sense, but wasn‚Äôt it just a random thrift store find?‚Äù Rio had read about it in a few interviews. Agatha always said it was something she had found while out with friends, and it was one of the bigger mysteries surrounding her persona. They walked back to their spot under the umbrella.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, but I‚Äôve grown attached. It now has a GPS chip on it, so I never lose it. It‚Äôs truly irreplaceable and priceless. Yes, it‚Äôs insured, though I don‚Äôt tell anyone how much.‚Äù Agatha didn‚Äôt currently have it on, it was in a safe within a safe, inside a wall safe in the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúUnderstandable.‚Äù Rio nodded. She could tell from the tone of Agatha‚Äôs voice not to ask any more questions about it. She had seen it on Agatha on multiple occasions, and it was even more beautiful and detailed up close. Rio did not ask her what was in it, and no one knew.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The early afternoon sun shone brightly as they gathered their things and headed back up to the house. Wanda had texted that the Malibu group wouldn‚Äôt be getting back until dinner time, and they knew the fishing group wouldn‚Äôt get home until later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs for lunch, chef?‚Äù Agatha asked as they walked into the kitchen, setting her things on the breakfast table. They would shower after eating, and frolicking in the ocean had left her hungry in more ways than one, but Agatha could only do so much.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio followed suit and looked in the fridge. ‚ÄúSpaghetti leftovers from last night, Your Highness.‚Äù She replied, taking out containers. ‚ÄúGrab plates, will you?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha feigned shock, placing her open hand in the middle of her chest. ‚ÄúPar-don?‚Äù She emphasized the word. ‚ÄúMoi? What if I break a nail?‚Äù She asked, dramatically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed and rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúOh, please, you keep your nails short for other activities, and you just spent the morning playing in the Pacific.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled a genuine smile that reached her eyes. The smile that Rio had been seeing a lot lately, whenever they bantered like this. Agatha turned and got the plates.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha couldn‚Äôt remember the last time something had come this easily to her, this back and forth, this closeness. Not since Wanda, and that had been more of a trauma bond, and immediately developed into a protective feeling. Even with the other women she was close to, it had taken her longer to develop this close of a relationship. There was her original coven,
     </span>
<span>
      but that didn‚Äôt exist anymore.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The first night she and Rio had really talked, she had wanted to bare her soul to her. A little over a month, and they had already developed an easy back and forth. Yes, there was some flirting, but they would eventually tamp that down. Agatha was just naturally flirty, after all. It was harmless.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They ate, cleaned up, and went to shower separately. When Agatha came back down, she wore an oversized purple Malibu t-shirt and black lounge shorts. Long, dark brown, damp hair pulled back in a ponytail. Rio was already on the couch with her book. Her hair was pulled up, and her dark green tank top showed that her skin had darkened a bit in the sun. She wore black bike shorts that had some type of leaf pattern on them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your smut?‚Äù Agatha asked as she sat down on the other end of the couch with her Kindle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHot. I miss sex.‚Äù Rio responded automatically.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Drown yourself in the ocean, Vidal.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She groaned inwardly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chuckled. ‚ÄúSame.‚Äù
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Play in traffic, Harkness,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      she thought. ‚ÄúI can leave you alone to read if you prefer.‚Äù She added, face red.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, I prefer your company."
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Do they make something for verbal diarrhea?
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny, as a teenager, growing up with Lorna Wu's daughter, I would have killed to be close friends with huge megastars. Now that I am, I forget you guys are even famous. You‚Äôre just normal people,‚Äù She looked up at Agatha, adding, ‚ÄúWith more money than God.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha couldn‚Äôt help but give a small laugh, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a downtime for us. There are times when there are paparazzi and cameras everywhere, names splashed all over the media, and then there are the quiet times like right now. I‚Äôm sure pictures will show up tomorrow of Wanda around Malibu, but nothing huge. Just ‚ÄòWanda Maximoff enjoying a weekend with friends‚Äô, hopefully. A few of the lesbian Twitter accounts will probably say something about Nat being there and not Vision. Jen will have it scrubbed. Then, a few of the accounts that are obsessed with Jen will say something about Jen and Alice, but that‚Äôs it. Someone will mention my absence, and we‚Äôll continue like normal. We both try to act as down-to-earth as possible because we are. We still have our diva moments and definitely did when we were younger, but we have an example to set.‚Äù She explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took it all in. She chewed on her lip for a minute and took a deep breath before finally asking the question that had been on her mind for, years, now that she thought about it. ‚ÄúAgatha, why, exactly, don‚Äôt you date seriously?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPass,‚Äù Agatha replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, come on. We‚Äôve shared a lot of things.‚Äù Rio huffed, trying to see past the neutral facade that Agatha was now wearing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt you date parents?‚Äù Agatha countered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPoint taken.‚Äù Rio was about to ask Agatha about
     </span>
<span>
      the faint scars she had noticed on her leg and back earlier
     </span>
<span>
      when the front door opened and their friends walked in. Rio hadn‚Äôt realized that it was already evening, meaning the fishing group would be back soon as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The Malibu group had brought pizza, and the fishing group returned with nothing except sunburns and fish tales. They were around the fire again, talking and roasting marshmallows, when Wanda decided it was time to interfere.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAs we all know, our movie premieres mid-October,‚Äù Wanda said, silencing everyone, garnering a few looks. ‚ÄúAgatha, you should bring Rio.‚Äù She added, before taking a drink of whatever concoction she had.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      All eyes turned to the two women who had previously been discussing musical interests. Rio choked on her water.
     </span>
<span>
      Maybe she needed to just stop drinking anything around this group when they were speaking.
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha glared at her best friend. If looks could kill, Wanda would have burst into flames.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still two months‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSix weeks,‚Äù Nat clarified.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that a school night?‚Äù Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on fall break then,‚Äù Alice informed her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow convenient,‚Äù Agatha and Rio muttered simultaneously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe twins and I can‚Äôt go see the movie. Our moms get naked,‚Äù Nicky supplied, matter-of-factly, as he popped a marshmallow in his mouth before either Rio or Agatha said anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMom is taking Dad,‚Äù the twins added as they each set a marshmallow on fire.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI prefer to stay out of the spotlight, but occasionally I am forced into it.‚Äù Vision‚Äôs expression was dour, a rarity for him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an introvert at heart,‚Äù he added quickly, his normal, easy smile returning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe need to go ahead and set it now to coordinate what you‚Äôre wearing,‚Äù Jen finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda watched Agatha and Rio carefully. Wanda knew what every look, glance, twitch, and eye sparkle from Agatha meant. They could quite literally have entire conversations without saying a word.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She watched Agatha look at Rio, the question in her eyes. Do you want to come with me?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was an easy one, surely Rio could catch that one, thought Wanda. She looked towards Rio, watching the young teacher tilt her head as if responding to Agatha's unspoken question. Both broke out in a subtle smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was delighted to see this silent exchange. It had taken Agatha and Wanda years to develop their connection. It had taken Agatha and Rio a month.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Soulmates!
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had called it. She couldn‚Äôt wait to send a text later..
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to go. I think it will be fun to tag along as your plus one.‚Äù Rio finally said aloud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù Said Wanda, ignoring the added comment. She turned to look at the boys, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting late. Go shower and head off to bed. We‚Äôre just going to talk shop for a bit.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They groaned but knew she meant to just go inside and play video games or something. ‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù They replied. Vision took that as his cue as well. ‚ÄúI will make sure they don‚Äôt burn the house down, Darling. He kissed Wanda‚Äôs forehead and stood. The boys hugged their moms and aunts, said goodnight to the others, and went inside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay, schedules for the next few months.‚Äù Wanda started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Agatha exchanged looks before Rio turned to Wanda. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt involve Alice or me‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda cut her off, ‚ÄúYes, it does, stay.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio remained where she sat and pulled out her phone, opening the Calendar app. She had a feeling it was about to fill up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIn addition to school happenings, what else do we have, Jen?‚Äù Wanda started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jennifer cleared her throat. They had planned all of this out on their trip. Go over their schedules for the next few months and push Agatha into inviting Rio at least to the premiere, New York for SNL, and the Halloween party. That would at least get them to November. Maybe by then, they‚Äôd know each other well enough to at least kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou two have talk shows around LA, and a few NY appearances, especially the closer we get to October. Wanda, your SNL episode is at the end of September, and Nat will go with you. Agatha, yours is the weekend after the premiere.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Agatha. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs your musical guest?‚Äù Rio asked quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled, mischief in her eyes. She already knew the reaction she was about to get. ‚ÄúChap‚Ä¶‚Äù She didn‚Äôt get to finish before Rio squealed. ‚ÄúWant to come?‚Äù She asked when Rio stopped. She shrieked a yes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen nodded and put it down. Wanda smirked, she knew what that response was going to be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen there‚Äôs the annual Halloween party. Wanda, costumes?‚Äù Jen asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI think Billy is going with his ‚Äòfriend‚Äô Eddie
     </span>
<span>
      Wilson, Sam Wilson‚Äôs son
     </span>
<span>
      . Tommy and Nicky will probably go as zombies, right, Aggie?‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      Wanda
     </span>
<span>
      asked, as Agatha nodded. That was their current thing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúVision and I are doing Glinda and Fiyero from Wicked.‚Äù Wanda finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha snorted, laughing as Wanda gave her a sharp look. Agatha mumbled something about Rio saying something funny, and Rio nodded conspiratorially.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAlice and I are going as Xena and Gabby,‚Äù Jen said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you need‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha started before a graham cracker connected with the side of her head. She turned to see Wanda looking around innocently. Instead, she muttered something about them making such a gay choice
     </span>
<span>
      and picking graham cracker out of her hair.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jennifer smirked and looked at Nat. ‚ÄúWhat about you? Are you and Agatha doing something?
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha letting you borrow the Elphaba costume, perhaps?
     </span>
<span>
      ‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat shook her head. ‚ÄúNo. I decided to be on duty that night and not dress up.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha automatically threw her hands up. ‚ÄúShe volunteered, I swear.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded. ‚ÄúI want to have eyes on all the camera screens
     </span>
<span>
      in The Tower
     </span>
<span>
      make sure all your drunk asses are safe,‚Äù she said with a smile that didn‚Äôt reach her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen nodded with a glance at Wanda, who was suddenly very interested in picking at her shorts. She looked back at Agatha. ‚ÄúAlright, Agatha?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up and then over at Rio. ‚ÄúWant to go to the Halloween party and wear some ridiculous coordinated costume with me?‚Äù She asked, keeping her face neutral.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, stilling her face as well. ‚ÄúYes, want to do Wheel of Time?‚Äù It was a series they both loved that only they watched.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Agatha replied. She thought about it for a second. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be Moirane‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio finished quickly, not wanting to be cast as the love interest, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be Lanfear.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded, somewhat disappointed that Rio would go as her nemesis.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       For the best, though, she‚Äôll be hit on all night.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She thought, but what did it matter to her?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen just nodded, inputting it all into her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI shared the calendar with everyone. Just to make life easier. In reality, Jen knew it would put everyone‚Äôs mind at peace if they knew where everyone was. The collective amount of trauma, trust, and abandonment issues in this group was staggering.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That night, Rio lay in the guest bed, unable to sleep. It was extremely comfortable, and her sleep playlist was on, but she just couldn‚Äôt get her mind to turn off. The conversation around the fire replayed in her mind. Everything had happened so fast. She knew she couldn‚Äôt talk to Alice about it right now, which also ruled out Jen. Wanda was stuck in her own personal ‚ÄòGood Luck, Babe‚Äô, and had orchestrated everything,
     </span>
<span>
      most likely to distract herself
     </span>
<span>
      . Nat was probably conversing with the security that Rio knew were crawling around the property, plus she would do whatever Wanda wanted. She sighed. The person Rio needed to talk to was the one she wanted to talk to the most.¬† She just had to trust herself and not throw herself at Agatha. There was just something about Agatha Harkness that she could get lost in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio
     </span>
<span>
      looked at her phone, one in the morning. ‚ÄúWorth a shot,‚Äù she breathed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Me:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Hey, are you awake?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She waited to see if the three dots showed up. A few minutes went by, and nothing. Rio sighed, resigning herself to a sleepless night when her door opened and closed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes. I am.‚Äù A familiar voice said as the bed shifted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúVery presumptuous of you to just crawl into bed with me,‚Äù Rio said with a nervous smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPlease, we snuggle on the couch most movie nights,‚Äù Agatha responded, making herself comfortable.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was right, and Rio didn‚Äôt mind. She felt like they had known each other for longer than they had, and Rio had grown accustomed to falling asleep
     </span>
<span>
      near
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha every Saturday night,
     </span>
<span>
      which was four, but who was counting?
     </span>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sleep.‚Äù She whined.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes, knowing Rio couldn‚Äôt see it in the dark. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all the smut you‚Äôve been reading.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt is not,‚Äù Rio sighed, ‚ÄúI keep thinking about what happened earlier and how you were kind of forced to invite me to everything. You don‚Äôt have to, you know.‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      Rio offered Agatha an out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat if I want to? What if I don‚Äôt want to take someone else to a premiere? Or to New York? As a friend, of course. No one else will do Wheel of Time with me for Halloween, and you will have women all over you in whatever Lanfear costume we come up with.‚Äù Agatha replied sincerely. She could handle whatever happened at the Halloween party just fine.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       You‚Äôre lying to yourself.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be your wingwoman,‚Äù She added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled, her nerves dying down, knowing that Agatha hadn‚Äôt felt obligated. ‚ÄúOkay, as long as you didn‚Äôt feel forced.‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      She didn‚Äôt comment on the wing-woman remark. While Rio knew that was the better option, she also already knew it wasn‚Äôt what she really wanted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPlease, kid, no one forces me to do anything.‚Äù Agatha scoffed. She was thankful for the darkness of the room, as she knew her eyes had drifted to Rio‚Äôs mouth.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Just friends who had spent the past month of Saturday nights together. You have shared a bed with Wanda a million times. You aren‚Äôt attracted to Wanda, but it‚Äôs fine. You have slept on the same couch with this woman multiple times. You‚Äôve platonically cuddled. A bed is no different, Harkness. Get it together. She rolled over and created a bit more space between them.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched as Agatha rolled over, and she copied the movement, so that their backs were towards each other, with several feet in between them.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       This is a bad idea. This has to be a bad idea.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She thought. The problem was that while she was hyperaware of the other woman in the bed with her, she already felt her eyelids getting heavier. Yes, the temptation was there, but so was the comfort and the ease of their relationship. She could easily fall asleep with Agatha Harkness every night.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Preferably in more of a relationship context.
      </span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
       Nicky graduates in two years.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She sighed and froze when she realized how loud it had been.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù Agatha asked sleepily. She had still been battling with herself, but she was an actress for a reason.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       How the fuck was she almost asleep?
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She thought. Though, her body was nodding off. ‚ÄúJust thinking.‚Äù Rio yawned, surprising herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI can go‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt,‚Äù Rio said immediately.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       What the fuck? The woman is pure temptation.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI really am used to falling asleep near you on Saturdays. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve done for a few weeks now.‚Äù She added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded, ‚ÄúSo am I. It‚Äôs just a different environment. Who are you hoping to see at the movie premiere?‚Äù They were still turned away from each other, but naming off celebrities became like counting sheep, as they drifted off to sleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sunday morning was a repeat of Saturday as Wanda and Nat sat at the table again after their run, drinking coffee
     </span>
<span>
      close together with careful touches and native accents.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha spent the night in Rio‚Äôs room.‚Äù Nat shared. She had been checking security footage, and a hallway camera had caught Agatha entering Rio‚Äôs room. There weren‚Äôt any cameras in private spaces, but with as many parties as they held here, they had been installed in all public spaces.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda thought about it momentarily before responding, ‚ÄúNothing happened. If they had even kissed, she would have already told me.‚Äù She still smiled.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Doesn‚Äôt date teachers, indeed. We‚Äôll see about that.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat knew Wanda was right. The two found sisters could practically read each other‚Äôs minds. It was why Agatha was the only other person who knew everything about Nat and Wanda, other than because she had been there right from the start. ‚ÄúThings are moving in the right direction for them if they‚Äôll let it continue.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded as she blew out a breath, stood, and walked back into the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The Russian knew that there was no use in going after her, that Wanda was lost in her thoughts and needed a moment. Nat gathered both of their mugs and took them to the kitchen. The boys were staying at the house today, and she knew that while Wanda loved her family, she wasn‚Äôt happy about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Breakfast was the same as the day before. Everyone gathered in the kitchen, doing different things. It had been decided that everyone was spending the day at the house, out by the pool. Everyone changed into pool wear after eating and reconvened.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys goofed off and near heart attacks were had as Tommy and Nicky did flips into the pool, nearly hitting their heads multiple times.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned to Agatha, who had taken a chair next to her, ‚ÄúHow many ER trips have those two had?‚Äù She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSurprisingly less than either of us thought they would. People know who we are regardless, however, when people know your security team and the nannies, you know it‚Äôs an issue.‚Äù Agatha recalled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio
     </span>
<span>
      blew air out of her nose.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚ÄùThat was still less than you thought?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBilly only had to go once or twice because he did something they told him to do,‚Äù Wanda said, as she pulled a chair up by their loungers. ‚ÄúThe other two, though. Stitches, broken bones, and a few false alarms. They‚Äôve calmed down a lot, but still, they think they‚Äôre invincible.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhich is why I have to do PR clean up for them too,‚Äù Jen added in, as she and Alice joined the group, Nat, behind them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhich is also why Vision is teaching them all to drive, he‚Äôs the safest and most patient of everyone,‚Äù Nat said as she sat in a chair beside Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As it was, Vision was having a discussion with Billy while yelling something about angles and rotations at Tommy and Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed, ‚ÄúHe tries, but those two are not applying physics to their recklessness right now.‚Äù Wanda nodded as she looked affectionately at Vision, and then over at Nat, who was in deep conversation with Alice and Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stood and sat on the edge of the pool with her legs
     </span>
<span>
      in the water
     </span>
<span>
      . Billy had gone off to take turns jumping in with the other boys. Vision stood next to Rio and started a conversation, and she took the opportunity to get to know more about him. He was an astrophysicist at UCLA and had met Wanda on a set when he was consulting. They had fallen in love and gotten married, according to him. Rio did see the love there and didn‚Äôt doubt that at all, though she still wondered about the full story.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shared about her love of plants and all things science, loudly mentioning the upcoming quiz on Tuesday.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving a quiz on Tuesday, too.‚Äù Vision laughed. ‚ÄúEvil teachers unite.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHere, here!‚Äù Alice said from where she sat, overhearing the conversation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all so mean!‚Äù Wanda shouted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been studying for Alice and Rio‚Äôs classes while we‚Äôve been here,‚Äù Billy said, before jumping in the pool.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôll probably fail,‚Äù Tommy said, shrugging.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to wing it, but I paid attention,‚Äù Nicky said before he pushed Tommy in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had snuck up behind Nicky, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a brat.‚Äù She said before pushing him in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey! That‚Äôs my son!‚Äù Agatha said, having snuck up behind Jen and pushing her in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn‚Äôt remember the last time she felt like this. Happy, surrounded by people she cared about. She stood up to get a drink when Agatha tried to push her in, too, but she grabbed on to her and pulled her in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you learn your lesson yesterday, Harkness? If I‚Äôm going down, so are you.‚Äù She laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda almost gave herself whiplash. ‚ÄúWhat happened yesterday?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just grinned. ‚ÄúOcean shenanigans.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen sighed loudly, ‚ÄúKeep it out of the media.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky groaned. ‚ÄúMom.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head. ‚ÄúNothing happened, and you all
     </span>
<span>
      need to get your minds out of the gutter
     </span>
<span>
      .‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat bit her tongue, so tempted to add that someone slept in someone else‚Äôs bed last night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys went in after lunch to play video games, and Vision joined them. He had been around this group to know they enjoyed their time together, and he did not enjoy the girl talk.
     </span>
<span>
      He also had a book to read, essays to grade, football to watch, and his own friend to talk to while he did all of that.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April and Jen went upstairs, muttering about a nap
     </span>
<span>
      while the other four women remained poolside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat finally let
     </span>
<span>
      her secret out
     </span>
<span>
      . ‚ÄúSo, sleeping together now?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFucking cameras.‚Äù Agatha scowled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Rio looked shocked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda suppressed a laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha
     </span>
<span>
      turned her head to look at
     </span>
<span>
      Rio. ‚ÄúThere are cameras in the public areas of the house since we have so many events here,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúMs. Head of Security, here, must have been checking them.‚Äù She added, eyes darting over at Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNothing happened. I couldn‚Äôt sleep because I felt like SOMEONE,‚Äù Rio cut her eyes at Wanda, ‚Äúhad pressured Agatha into inviting me to things, so I texted to see if she was awake. She came to my room instead of texting, we talked and fell asleep. That‚Äôs it.‚Äù she explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou do not have to explain anything to these two busybodies. We are grown adults and friends. Close friends and nothing more.‚Äù Agatha glared at Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda put her hands up
     </span>
<span>
      in defense
     </span>
<span>
      . ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say a single thing. It was the other redheaded demon this time.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat
     </span>
<span>
      grinned wildly
     </span>
<span>
      . ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm allowed to create trouble now and then. We‚Äôll see how long the two of you remain friends. I‚Äôm going to check cameras and do my job.‚Äù She said as she got up, eyes lingering on Wanda before she left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio scoffed. ‚ÄúYou two aren‚Äôt very subtle.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNeither are the two of you.‚Äù She shot back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio bit her tongue before she said anything else. She didn‚Äôt have anything against Wanda and didn‚Äôt want to hurt her. She could tell that whatever the situation was, it was painful and tearing her apart. Instead, she reached over and put a hand on her shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIf you ever need to talk to someone other than Agatha, or if Agatha isn‚Äôt available, I‚Äôm here. I know a few things about extremely difficult situationships.‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs voice was soft, and she
     </span>
<span>
      gave her a meaningful look
     </span>
<span>
      when she
     </span>
<span>
      saw the tears Wanda was trying to hold back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Wanda whispered,
     </span>
<span>
      standing to leave
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
<span>
      As she left, she gave Agatha a pointed look, bent over, and whispered, ‚ÄúI give you both until the new year.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head, earning a sigh from Wanda as her sister muttered something in Romanian and went inside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned to Rio.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWant to play a game?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat kind of game?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGet your ass in the pool and find out.‚Äù She replied as she got in herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Curious, Rio followed her. ‚ÄúOkay, what‚Äôs this game?‚Äù She asked as they were both treading water in the deep end.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚Äú
     </span>
<span>
      A little game of ‚Äòask me anything‚Äô.
     </span>
<span>
      We‚Äôre going to race to the opposite side and back. Whoever wins gets to ask the other a question, and they have to answer it. The questions we refused to answer yesterday are off limits, and we can‚Äôt ask about‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio cut her off, knowing what she was about to say, ‚ÄúOther people‚Äôs stuff. I wouldn‚Äôt. Not our stories to tell.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. ‚ÄúRight. Up for it?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚Äú
     </span>
<span>
      This is a trap, but
     </span>
<span>
      prepare to bare your soul, Harkness!‚Äù She exclaimed as she set up to push herself off the wall.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhatever, kid. Ready, set, go.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They pushed off, both gliding underwater most of the way to the other side, they each got a few strokes in before flipping and pushing off the other side. Rio was only an inch taller than the older woman, so speed mattered. She touched the starting side right before Agatha did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHa! I win!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBarely!‚Äù Agatha shouted, but fine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start easy, favorite color?‚Äù Rio already knew it, but she didn‚Äôt want to start with soul-baring questions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, come on. Purple, yours is green.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled. ‚ÄúOkay, then you can skip that one.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio barely won the next round. ‚ÄúFavorite food?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha made an annoyed face. ‚ÄúRio. We each know that about each other, too. Yours is cereal, and mine is Italian, and anything you make.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smirked. She was just trying to annoy Agatha at the moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed, continuing, ‚ÄúWe know all the basics about each other.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Our
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      favorite movie?
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The Witches Road
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . Which you don‚Äôt think is conceited on my part, because it‚Äôs a fucking good movie.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Our
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      favorite TV show?
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Sisters
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . Yours to watch, mine for memories and milestones in my career. We both prefer the mountains and almost always have some type of background noise. My first pet was a rabbit named Se√±or Scratchy. Raven is yours. We‚Äôll be here forever if I start on music and books, so I think we can skip the easy questions and go a bit deeper.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs face was soft during her monologue, neither angry nor upset. She wanted,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       needed
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , Rio to understand that she had heard her and appreciated Rio, for Rio-as is.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWow, and we just met.‚Äù Rio joked, trying to lighten the moment, though the look in her eyes matched the seriousness in Agatha‚Äôs.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFine. What are those scars on your back and your leg? They‚Äôre very faint, so I‚Äôm sure you have them edited out of pictures and covered with makeup, especially the one on your leg.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded, ‚ÄúGood job, detective. They‚Äôre souvenirs of when Nat tried to take me out that one time. Knife down the back, bullet grazed my leg. It was all very dramatic.‚Äù She would not be telling Rio about the other scar from that night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha reached forward and used her fingertip to gently close Rio‚Äôs mouth, which had come open from shock. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived an interesting life.
     </span>
<span>
      Let‚Äôs go again, Vidal.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This time, Agatha won. ‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs see. Most embarrassing high school moment.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs brutal and not fair because you didn‚Äôt go to high school!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI also don‚Äôt have to answer.‚Äù She laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thought about it. ‚ÄúI had a crush on a girl and tried to let her cheat on my test in science class. Not only did I get caught, but our tests were different, so she would‚Äôve failed anyway.‚Äù She responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSmooth.‚Äù Agatha laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was absolutely not.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio won the next round.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWorst person to work with?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTony Stark. Completely full of himself. Pepper is great, love her. Tony is just all ego,
     </span>
<span>
      even if he is a great dad and a decent husband. Don‚Äôt ever tell him I said those things
     </span>
<span>
      .‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      Their rivalry was well known, though as an award-winning director, they did work together frequently.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚ÄúI get that vibe. Morgan is a sweetheart of a kid, though.
     </span>
<span>
      I took your recommendation and she‚Äôs cat-sitting for me this weekend.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled fondly at the mention of Morgan, ‚ÄúShe and Nicky have known each other since birth, really, but have been friends since pre-k. Again, great kid.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio won again. ‚ÄúIf you hadn‚Äôt been forced into acting, what would you have wanted to do?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha
     </span>
<span>
      bit her lip, deep in thought, and mulled over the question for a moment, putting one hand on her hip and lightly gripping the lip of the pool with the other, while treading water. She finally looked back at Rio, an eyebrow raised
     </span>
<span>
      . ‚ÄúYou know, I have never thought about it. Hollywood has been my entire life. Even if I were to retire, I‚Äôm set and could just do charity work, some business, whatever I wanted. I never had that childhood ‚Äòwhen I grow up‚Äô dream.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked somewhat lost, and Rio felt for her. Neither of them had a
     </span>
<span>
      traditional
     </span>
<span>
      childhood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI never had unrealistic career goals.‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs fingertips barely gripped the edge of the pool. ‚Äú
     </span>
<span>
      I never dreamed of being a rocket scientist or an astronaut. It was always a teacher, something that was practical and doable.
     </span>
<span>
      Something that even someone from the neighborhoods I lived in could get a scholarship and do.
     </span>
<span>
      I was good at science, and while there were other things I could do with that, teaching was the most achievable.
     </span>
<span>
      Even though I grew up an unofficial Wu, it still made the most sense. Again, it's not glorious, absolutely not the best or easiest career choice, but not the worst. Solid. Achievable. Practical.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚Äù Rio explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was then that Rio realized that despite the age gap and the different worlds they were from, they were extremely similar, and it was why they got along so well and why they felt so seen by each other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTell me you have trauma without telling me you have trauma.‚Äù Agatha smiled sarcastically.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOne more?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, sensing some trick hidden under Agatha‚Äôs bikini strap, and she was right. As Rio closed in on her win, Agatha shoved her shoulder, pushed her back, and touched the wall before Rio could.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI win!‚Äù Agatha said, grinning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awful,‚Äù Rio said, splashing Agatha in the face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou love it.‚Äù She replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I could.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She thought. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the question?‚Äù She asked instead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt thought that far ahead.‚Äù Agatha thought for a moment. ‚ÄúDo you, or did you, ever want kids?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy, Agatha Harkness, are you asking me to be your baby daddy?‚Äù she asked before breaking out into giggles. Rio Vidal did not giggle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was the sweetest sound Agatha had ever heard, and she vowed to make her do it again as much as she could. She couldn‚Äôt help but laugh, which caused her to snort. ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúIt was an honest question, you brat!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù She said after regaining some semblance of composure, ‚ÄúIf I were to be with or marry someone with a child or children, then yes. It was always a hard ‚Äúno‚Äù to that question
     </span>
<span>
      growing up, due to my fears of falling in my mother‚Äôs footsteps
     </span>
<span>
      . However, it depends on who I‚Äôm with and if that happens sooner rather than later. I‚Äôm not getting any younger.
     </span>
<span>
      I‚Äôm not opposed.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      There was a time in the not-so-distant past when she thought she would become a stepmother to three blonde teenagers of whom she had been very fond, and possibly have a child. It was not something she wanted to dwell on right now as she pushed the old ache away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wasn't entirely sure why that answer was so important to her, but she had found herself invested in
     </span>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs response
     </span>
<span>
      . She had Nicky, and anyone close to her had to understand that he was number one in her life, even if he was older. She certainly wasn't having any more children,
     </span>
<span>
      though the thought of being with a younger woman, or adopting, hadn‚Äôt completely been ruled out for her
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha saw a flash of something across Rio‚Äôs face with her answer, but didn‚Äôt want to pry.
     </span>
<span>
      Something to unpack during a sleepless night, she thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They climbed out of the pool, went inside to shower, and changed to reconvene with the whole house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The four women had been watching from an overlooking balcony. Wanda couldn‚Äôt have done much better if she had been in their minds herself. She knew Agatha and knew she wasn‚Äôt going to move faster than Rio was comfortable with.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt they just kiss already!‚Äù Jen said, exasperated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDo you know how long we said that about the two of you?‚Äù Nat asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTouch√©,‚Äù Alice said, raising her wine glass.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda pinched the bridge of her nose. ‚ÄúThis is painful.‚Äù She sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked over at her, knowing it wasn‚Äôt just the scene below them that she was referring to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen leaned forward. ‚ÄúBetween the football games, the entire month of October, and whatever we need to do after that, they should figure it out.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Rio has a damn good reason as to why she doesn‚Äôt date parents.‚Äù As three sets of eyes looked at her, she shook her head, ‚ÄúOh no, not my story to tell. That‚Äôs all her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda just nodded. ‚ÄúAgatha is many things, but if she really likes Rio, and I can guarantee she does, then she‚Äôs not going to do anything to go against that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They spent their last night around the poolside fire pit. Rio and Alice kept throwing out random questions for the boys to help them study. Tommy was trying, desperately.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, can you give me extra points because you‚Äôre into my aunt?‚Äù He teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs eyes went wide, and her face was one of shock, strictly from the audacity.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The looks on every face varied from shock to trying not to laugh. Agatha was biting back a laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was not amused. ‚ÄúDude! That‚Äôs my mom!‚Äù He turned to Rio. ‚ÄúThat is my mom, though, so do I just get an automatic A, or‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNicholas Scratch Harkness!‚Äù Agatha yelled, trying so hard not to laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am not into Agatha!‚Äù Rio cried, face bright red.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe blushing says otherwise,‚Äù Alice goaded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAunt Aggie has the hots for you, too,‚Äù Billy said, grinning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou are no longer my favorite!‚Äù Agatha shouted, her own face turning red.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda owed the boys for this one. She had a shit-eating grin on her face and pointed at Agatha, who rolled her eyes at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision was laughing at the boys. ‚ÄúNow, boys, stop teasing. They‚Äôre just friends.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what Alice and Jen said for years,‚Äù Tommy replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice blushed. As Jen looked at Tommy. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it past your bedtime, rugrat?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He stuck his tongue out at her. Wanda just nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúActually, boys, it is time for you three to head upstairs. Go.‚Äù She directed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They nodded, gave their goodnights, and left, teasing as they went. Vision also made his departure, once again kissing Wanda on the forehead as he left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked pointedly at Rio,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat? Your son needs to study. He‚Äôs not getting extra points!‚Äù Rio replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt was worth a shot.‚Äù Wanda laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The women discussed upcoming football games and gossiped about which parents would be sneaking alcohol into the game, and what kids would be sneaking underneath the bleachers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The night grew late, and everyone departed to their rooms, the beach weekend coming to a close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had changed into her pajamas, having showered after swimming earlier, when she heard her door open and close softly. She let out a breath she didn‚Äôt know she was holding as she turned around. She knew it was Agatha and found that she had hoped she would come.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded as Agatha looked at her with the question in her eyes before settling into what was now her side of the bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot a Saturday. So, when we‚Äôre in the same place overnight, we share a bed?‚Äù Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLike friends,‚Äù Agatha stated, nodding.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAbsolutely,‚Äù Rio replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even in their sleep, the two gravitated towards one another. The large California king mattress was no match for their attraction. ONLY FRIENDS, Rio reiterated to herself. Disentangling herself from Agatha's warm arms, which had wrapped around her in deep sleep. Still, it felt like the most normal thing in the world.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When they headed back the next day, she knew she had grown closer to everyone over the weekend, especially Agatha. She had to pull Jen and Alice apart, reminding them that they would see each other in less than twenty-four hours, and reminded the boys about their quizzes the next day.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      If her friendship with Agatha was this strong after a month, where would it be by the time they went to New York?

<em>
<span>
       Early September
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio never expected anything from her friends except for the ease of being around them. She never expected to be friends with superstars or get invited to movie premieres, Saturday Night Live, parties, or any of the things she was suddenly preparing to attend next month. It was overwhelming, but she felt like she was just doing things with her friends. Some of those things just happened to be red carpet and star-studded events, no big deal.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before any of that, there was her actual job and the
     </span>
<span>
      events and responsibilities that came with it.
     </span>
<span>
      She had
     </span>
<span>
      administered
     </span>
<span>
      the first quiz of the semester
     </span>
<span>
      the week after Labor Day and their amazing beach weekend.
     </span>
<span>
      While most of her students had
     </span>
<span>
      hit it out of the park
     </span>
<span>
      , a
     </span>
<span>
      select few had not, kicking off after-school tutoring and make-up testing
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs Thursday tutoring session had just wrapped up, and she was about to leave herself when Lilia Calderu, principal of SHIELD, walked into the large science classroom and closed the door behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúVidal,
     </span>
<span>
      have a seat, I need to speak with you for a moment,‚Äù the esteemed principal directed
     </span>
<span>
      as
     </span>
<span>
      she perched on top of a desk like it was the most natural thing in the world for her. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt take long,‚Äù she assured, noting the young teacher‚Äôs hesitation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam. Let me text Alice and tell her it will be a minute.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù The older woman waited
     </span>
<span>
      , looking around at the way Rio had set up the classroom, while
     </span>
<span>
      Rio sent off the text and looked back up, meeting her boss‚Äôs eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know that you have joined a certain inner circle, and I must remind you that it is imperative to stick to NDAs
     </span>
<span>
      and make certain you guard any secrets that may be shared with you by certain parents
     </span>
<span>
      ,‚Äù Lilia said seriously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia regarded her for a moment.
     </span>
<span>
      Lilia read people and she did it well. She wouldn‚Äôt be the woman she was or in the positions she was in if she didn‚Äôt. She had trusted Alice last spring and could tell that Rio was someone who was honest and genuine. Lilia Calderu also had her sources.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had a sworn duty to protect the people around her, and that included the secrets that those people held.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia‚Äôs face softened, having found that Rio was worthy. ‚ÄúYou can trust Agatha, you know. It was I that made her bring Nicky here, connected the two of them to this place. Made sure she had the lawyer she had as a child.
     </span>
<span>
      You do not know any of this, by the way,‚Äù She paused to make sure the teacher understood what she was conveying. Seeing Rio nod, she continued
     </span>
<span>
      ,¬† ‚ÄúWhen you run a specific institution, you know a lot of things about a lot of people. You would do well to remember that.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚Äù Lilia stood and looked back at a large planter in the corner of the room. ‚ÄúPilea Peperomiodes, not an easy plant to grow inside Ms. Vidal. I‚Äôve only known one other person to successfully do so, and yours is quite possibly healthier than hers. That‚Äôs quite the green thumb.‚Äù She turned back to her.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh! And, parents like you so far, keep it up! Looking forward to the game tomorrow! Go Superstars!‚Äù She finished and left before Rio could reply, leaving the door open as Alice walked in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou ready to go?‚Äù Alice asked. ‚ÄúI knew Lilia wouldn‚Äôt stay very long.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI never know what the fuck Lilia means. It takes me a good two business weeks to figure it out.‚Äù Rio
     </span>
<span>
      continued to stare
     </span>
<span>
      out the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a decade and I‚Äôm still learning.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tilted her head as she slung her backpack over her shoulder, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been here for a while and know everyone well, was Lilia the reason Agatha brought Nicky here?‚Äù Rio asked as she turned off the lights and they walked out of the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice made sure she chose her words carefully. She wasn‚Äôt prepared to share everything with Rio yet. It wasn‚Äôt lying, really. She was just telling her half-truths. ‚ÄúLilia was one of Agatha‚Äôs tutors when she was young, and so when Nicky was old enough to go to school, she found out Lilia was the principal, and she trusted Lilia, so yeah.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Okay, that‚Äôs close to the truth.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Alice thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they drove home, Rio couldn‚Äôt help but think about how normal everything felt so far. Football games, her best friend dating
     </span>
<span>
      someone that seemed perfect for her
     </span>
<span>
      , concerned parents, parents, and teachers still volunteering to help out at the concession stand. So there were bodyguards and heightened security everywhere, state-of-the-art facilities, a sniper‚Äôs nest at a high school football game‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt completely normal, but it was done in a way that it was very concealed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOther than the football game, what are your plans for the weekend?‚Äù Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúJen and I are going out Saturday night,‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      they were actually having dinner with Lilia, but Rio didn‚Äôt need to know that. ‚Äú
     </span>
<span>
      So we‚Äôll miss movie night, nothing Sunday, you?‚Äù Alice looked over at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMovie night Saturday, and it looks like everyone except you and I are headed out Sunday for promo events in New York for a few days, then they‚Äôll be back here.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shrugged. ‚ÄúGet used to a lot of texting.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you mean. Just a normal amount of texting a friend of mine is all,‚Äù Rio shrugged back,
     </span>
<span>
      slightly mockingly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve taken bets on how long it takes. Do you want in?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSure, put me down for fuck you guys.‚Äù Rio groaned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only a matter of time. You‚Äôve already shared a bed.‚Äù Alice grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was spilling my very complicated feelings to you and you‚Äôre using that against me right now! I am hurt!‚Äù Rio joked, knowing that Alice didn‚Äôt mean any true harm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am your sister from an unknown mister, and it is my duty.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After her usual bedtime routine, switching her playlist, and getting comfortable with Raven purring next to her, Rio grabbed her phone to text Agatha, as had also become routine.
     </span>

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Absolutely not.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was holding on to the fact that she didn‚Äôt date Nicky‚Äôs teachers,
     </span>
<span>
      or anyone, for that matter. She had her heart utterly annihilated once and would not go down that road again.
     </span>
<span>
      She also didn‚Äôt want to lose Rio‚Äôs friendship if things went poorly. Lines were being blurred, but they could handle that like the grown adults they were.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>

      Agatha üíú

      Apparently ‚Äòfuck you guys‚Äô wasn‚Äôt

<p>
<span>
      an option.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      If the last time Rio had dated a parent had ended terribly, this was bound to end even worse, and that was definitely not an option.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The only way this could end worse
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , she thought to herself,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       is if you actually died this time.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Okay, so not worse, but losing Agatha‚Äôs friendship would break her in a much different way.
     </span>

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha found herself almost adding kissing emojis like a teenage girl. She groaned. This was not normal for her. Agatha Harkness did not pine. She did not yearn. Women came to her. Women threw themselves at her. What was happening? She was fifty-one years old, damnit, not fifteen. She screamed into her pillow before rolling over and trying to go to sleep, only to dream of Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Of course, a school for the children of Hollywood stars would have ‚Äòsuperstars‚Äô as its mascot. Rio had rolled her eyes when she had first heard it and still thought it was too on the nose even now. She thought cougars would have been appropriate and funny, but she hadn‚Äôt been in charge of choosing the mascot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked around the gym as students gathered for the pep rally.
     </span>
<span>
      As she mentally went over the students‚Äô names, she was reminded that it
     </span>
<span>
      wasn‚Äôt just the Hollywood elite that sent their children to SHIELD, it was athletes, CEOs, billionaires, tech bros, politicians, and people up in that range.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stood with the other teachers and cheered as the football players came out, cheering for Nicky. She waved to Billy in the stands and cheered for other students. Rio had always enjoyed supporting students
     </span>
<span>
      for all activities, not just sports.
     </span>
<span>
      Football days were also fun days for most or make-up days for students to bring up grades. She enjoyed it, and the chance to get to know her students better.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By the time the last bell rang, she was anxious for the football game. She didn‚Äôt care if they won or not. She was just ready to see a certain megastar. She told herself it was because they had gotten so close, and she would be excited to see Alice and the others as well. She was lying to herself, but
     </span>
<span>
      it made her feel more like an adult and less like one of her students with a fleeting crush of the week.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even if there was nothing fleeting about this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By the time she got to the concession stand to report for her shift, she was vibrating with excitement. She knew they were also working with several other parents, including Carol Danvers. She and her wife, Maria, had a daughter Nicky‚Äôs age who was in Rio‚Äôs advanced class. Carol was another award-winning actress, and Maria was a literal rocket scientist.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio walked into the building to see Agatha setting up with other parents and teachers. Agatha smiled when she saw her, excusing herself and making her way to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey! You‚Äôve got popcorn, I‚Äôve got candy.‚Äù She said as she hugged Rio
     </span>
<span>
      in greeting
     </span>
<span>
      , a hug that was over too quickly for Rio‚Äôs liking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was slightly surprised by the friendly greeting in such a public place, cut considering people were taking bets on them getting together, and they had shared a bed, she‚Äôd take it.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey just happen to be right next to each other,‚Äù Danvers said as she walked over to the hot dogs
     </span>
<span>
      with a smirk
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on hot dog duty?‚Äù Rio asked innocently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, which works for me.‚Äù Danvers shrugged with a wink.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned over and whispered, ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs was Danvers‚Äô pick in the betting pool, and thought I‚Äôd like to be next to you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stifled a laugh, remembering their ocean battle from last weekend and the bet they had made.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNicky going to lead us to state this year, Agatha?‚Äù Another parent asked, interrupting their conspiring.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched as Agatha turned into Agatha Harkness, football mom, superstar, and America‚Äôs Sweetheart. ‚ÄúHopefully! As long as your son can protect him long enough.‚Äù There was laughter before someone opened the windows to the stand, and their work began.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Shifts were only a quarter, and thankfully, the time went by quickly.
     </span>
<span>
      Working in such a
     </span>
<span>
      confined
     </span>
<span>
      space,
     </span>
<span>
      Rio and Agatha
     </span>
<span>
      had bumped into each other constantly, mostly by accident, but neither woman minded. When their time was up, the
     </span>
<span>
      next shift took over,
     </span>
<span>
      and as they left the building, Agatha grabbed Rio by the arm and led her away before she could get caught up in any conversations with parents who wanted to know how their student was doing in her class.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey!
     </span>
<span>
      Mrs. Chavez needs to speak with me
     </span>
<span>
      .‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      Rio laughed as Agatha pulled her away
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head. ‚Äú
     </span>
<span>
      I can assure you that she is not interested in the science you teach, and we have a game to catch and a quarterback to cheer for.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚Äú
     </span>
<span>
      Oh, right! Nicky. I haven‚Äôt seen him play yet.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They reached their group in the stands. Tommy was on the junior varsity team and wasn‚Äôt playing
     </span>
<span>
      as their game had been the previous night. He was still paying very close attention to the plays and all the action on the field below.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚Äú
     </span>
<span>
      How‚Äôs he doing
     </span>
<span>
      ?‚Äù Agatha asked as they
     </span>
<span>
      scooted into the bleachers
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOne
     </span>
<span>
      passing
     </span>
<span>
      touchdown so far,
     </span>
<span>
      and twenty yards from
     </span>
<span>
      second. Tied game. Defenses are doing well
     </span>
<span>
      and stopping everything on both sides
     </span>
<span>
      .‚Äù Tommy
     </span>
<span>
      rattled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked out at the field where Nicky was lining up. They were at the 20-yard line
     </span>
<span>
      a pass he should easily be able to convert for a touchdown
     </span>
<span>
      . He saw
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha
     </span>
<span>
      right before the snap, and that was the good luck he needed.
     </span>
<span>
      Nicky couldn‚Äôt find an open receiver, scrambled, and ran it in for a touchdown
     </span>
<span>
      . The stands erupted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      His ability to think quickly on his feet was what had secured him the starting quarterback position the previous year.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The game had been close
     </span>
<span>
      , and the Superstars barely won 28-27.
     </span>
<span>
      Nicky, a perfectionist like his mother, knew he needed to improve and discussed strategies with Vision and Tommy after the game.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know there are a lot of great high schools around here, Nicky, but have you thought of watching tapes from schools in other great football states? To get plays and tips from those?‚Äù Rio asked as they all walked to the parking lot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He shook his head, droplets of water from his quick shower flying off. ‚ÄúNo. I hadn‚Äôt thought about that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled at him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll text Rogers and give him some names of schools. I have a friend who coached basketball, and she did that, helped the team a lot.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThanks Rio! So you like football?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Nicky continued their conversation back to the vehicles and at their after-game victory dinner. A tradition Agatha had started with Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda leaned over and whispered into Agatha‚Äôs ear. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre already bonding.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. ‚ÄúYes, like you do with your friend‚Äôs kids.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a little more‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShut up and eat your fries before I steal them.‚Äù
     </span>

<span>
      September continued, filled with football games for two out of the three boys, and Billy started rehearsals for the fall musical. The coven continued with their movie nights, and everyone had work, whether it was celebrity or teaching-related.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Agatha continued to build a closer rapport, Alice and Jen were disgustingly adorable, and something was happening in the Maximoff household.
     </span>
<span>
      Wanda was growing more and more restless, and it was affecting Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the month crawled along Agatha started table reads for her new TV show, as well as costume fittings, and promotional events were picking up for both stars. It was a Thursday evening later in the month as Wanda sat in the living room helping Billy run lines for his role in the fall musical. They were doing Beetlejuice, and he was the lead. Vision was on the floor at the coffee table, helping Tommy with his math. Tommy was failing and hadn‚Äôt been able to play in the junior varsity game that night. Coach Rogers wouldn‚Äôt even let him sit on the bench until he passed, and he was surly about it, but trying his hardest to truly understand the material. Nicky was listening to music on the opposite couch, typing a history essay for Alice‚Äôs class. He was staying over while Agatha was in New York for a few days. Wanda smiled as she surveyed the scene of happiness before her, then looked over at Nat, the beautiful redhead she had‚Ä¶ until reality hit her, as it always did. Nat‚Äôs face quickly dissipated into Vision‚Äôs, her husband. The man that she had married when she was twenty-six and had been married to for almost twenty years, and would be with for so much longer‚Ä¶
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMom? Mom?‚Äù Billy‚Äôs voice cut through her thoughts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She startled and looked at him, ‚ÄúOh, sweetie, I‚Äôm sorry. I just thought of something. Give me a quick minute.‚Äù She got up, grabbed her phone, and tried to walk as normally as possible to her bedroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay, Wanda, hold it together.‚Äù She whispered to herself, voice shaking. She did her breathing exercises to calm herself down so she could get through her mom and wife duties for another hour.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Think.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha and Nat were in New York, so that was out. She couldn‚Äôt talk to Jen, who would just go into PR mode instead of friend mode, which also ruled out Alice since they were attached at the hip. Wanda opened her texts without thinking. If Agatha trusted Rio, she could too,
     </span>
<span>
      remembering Rio‚Äôs offer from Labor Day weekend.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Me:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I know it‚Äôs a school night, but it‚Äôs an
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      emergency. Can I come over in about
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      an hour and a half?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She sent the text and then realized how the ‚Äòemergency‚Äô part might be taken.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Me:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It‚Äôs not about Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Rio:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Of course.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Are you okay?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Me:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I‚Äôll bring the wine.

</p>
<p>
<span>
      DO NOT TELL AGATHA.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Rio:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I have the emotional support cat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Shit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda smiled before blowing out a breath. She just needed to get through the evening, and then she‚Äôd drive over to Rio‚Äôs and just let everything out. She knew she could trust Ri,o and she had a feeling that the younger woman,
     </span>
<span>
      like so many of the women that surrounded her,
     </span>
<span>
      was wise beyond her years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She
     </span>
<span>
      returned
     </span>
<span>
      to the living room, resuming her position next to Billy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision looked up at her with a questioning look. ‚ÄúIs everything okay, darling?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, though, is it okay if I head to Rio‚Äôs in a bit? She‚Äôs having a bit of an emergency.‚Äù She replied in her best concerned friend voice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy raised an eyebrow as Tommy smirked. Nicky, thankfully, couldn‚Äôt hear due to his headphones.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision ignored his sons,
     </span>
<span>
      seeing through his wife‚Äôs white lie.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course, dear. I can take over running lines with Billy if you want to leave now,‚Äù he offered.
     </span>
<span>
      Vision had noticed changes in Wanda‚Äôs behavior over the last few months. It put him on edge. He didn‚Äôt know what could be brewing next.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy‚Äôs head popped up as he gave his mom a pleading look. His dad was not good at acting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda just smiled. ‚ÄúNo, it can wait. Boys first.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This was one of the reasons she had fallen in love with Vision, and she really had loved him. She still did, but it wasn‚Äôt a romantic love anymore
     </span>
<span>
      if it ever had been in the first place
     </span>
<span>
      . He was sweet and selfless, always putting his family first. He hadn‚Äôt had to think before offering to take over for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Forty-five minutes later, homework was finished. Wanda gave Vision a quick peck on the cheek goodbye, said goodnight to the boys, grabbed two bottles of wine, and headed to Rio‚Äôs. She was going to drive herself, but Vision had insisted on having someone drive her since she had planned on drinking. Not her having a caring and thoughtful husband while she weighed her options of leaving him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had been on edge since she got the text from Wanda. What could possibly be going on that she was coming to her for? She could only think of one topic that Wanda would come to her for right now, and not Jen or Alice, and that was a certain Russian. Agatha‚Äôs ‚Äòwait for her to come to you‚Äô when she had asked had apparently been more prophetic than anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Knowing they‚Äôd be up late, she was already in PJs and mostly ready for bed, her work bag ready for tomorrow and next to the door. She had chilled wine glasses and random snacks out, an appropriate playlist on, and a fresh box of tissues ready to go. She was ready to be a supportive friend.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took a deep breath as she stood in front of Rio‚Äôs door. She had been here before, normally one door down at Alice‚Äôs, and now about to share parts of the last twenty-seven years of her life, of which only
     </span>
<span>
      a few
     </span>
<span>
      other people knew every part. She clutched the tote bag that held the wine bottles and knocked, knowing that if Agatha was going to eventually be with Rio, then Wanda had to tell her at some point. Might as well be now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio opened the door and let Wanda in. She closed the door and had barely turned around when Wanda broke into a sob and melted against her. Rio suspected it was bad if that‚Äôs all it took. She wrapped her arms around Wanda, and they stood there for a moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôre going to talk through it. You don‚Äôt have to keep it in, you can talk to me, okay?‚Äù She soothed. She knew how it felt to have your
     </span>
<strike>
<span>
       best friend
      </span>
</strike>
<span>
      sister in another city and no one to talk to. It‚Äôs how she had felt for the past few years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Wanda‚Äôs initial sobs died away, she stepped back, wiping her eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôve just been holding that back for longer than I thought,‚Äù she said with a watery laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs eyes were soft as she gave a small smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôve got Kleenex and everything ready to go, come on. Tell me everything.‚Äù She gestured to the living room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They settled in on the couch, turning to face each other. Rio opened the wine and poured them both a full glass. She felt they were going to go through both bottles rather quickly. Raven had already found a home on Wanda‚Äôs lap, for which Wanda looked grateful. She needed to do something with both hands. Petting a cat with one hand and holding a wine glass in the other worked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took a sip of her wine and looked at Rio, trying to decipher how to start the conversation, and she wasn‚Äôt sure how. She looked at Rio with big green eyes, ‚ÄúI don't know where to start‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked back at Wanda, raising an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWherever you feel comfortable. Agatha hasn‚Äôt told me
     </span>
<span>
      much of anything, really.
     </span>
<span>
      She would never betray your trust, so everything I‚Äôm about to say is what I have picked up over the past nearly two months.‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      Rio
     </span>
<span>
      took a sip of her wine as Wanda nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat I know is that you and Nat met when you were both 18. She was hired to kill Agatha, and from what I saw when Nat told me that story, she was not planning on you being there, or just you in general. Agatha struck a deal with her, and she joined the merry band of misfits. You married Vision, I assume, because you decided
     </span>
<span>
      it was easier to fit into the mold created for you
     </span>
<span>
      , and now you‚Äôre realizing that it wasn‚Äôt necessarily a mistake, but it‚Äôs not the life you wanted
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou and Nat are obviously in love, and you both have been doing a terrible job at hiding it around us,
     </span>
<span>
      or at all,
     </span>
<span>
      lately. I don‚Äôt know how deep it goes, I don‚Äôt know the whole backstory, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve gathered.‚Äù Rio finished her summary, watching for Wanda‚Äôs reaction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda sighed heavily, finishing her wine and pouring another. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt wrong. That‚Äôs an oversimplification, but you aren‚Äôt wrong.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched Wanda pour her second glass and realized just how much of a toll this had taken. Yes, Wanda drank, they all did, but usually not this quickly.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou can share as much or as little as you want. There is no judgment here, Wanda. I am here for support, and insight if you want it, friendship, and the occasional snide remark.‚Äù She said sincerely. These women meant so much to Rio, and she truly wanted to be someone they could come to about anything and everything. She also wanted every single one of them to be happy and live their best life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was quiet for a moment, still trying to decide where to begin, before taking a deep breath and letting it out. ‚ÄúNat once told me that she saw me and knew she couldn‚Äôt kill someone that immediately took her breath away, and that‚Äôs the only reason we got the upper hand.‚Äù She laughed. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that for a line?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMan, oldest line in the assassin handbook, I‚Äôm sure,‚Äù Rio interjected, refilling her now-empty glass.
     </span>
<span>
      She silently reminded herself that she had to work tomorrow and needed to slow down. She did not have to keep up with the Eastern European who could probably drink two bottles of wine and act out one of her earlier movies from memory.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda laughed, ‚ÄúI was eighteen and Agatha was...twenty-four? When Nat tried to murder her that night. Good thing I looked cute. Agatha wanted to keep it out of the media, so she pulled some legal strings and found out who had sent Nat.‚Äù Wanda stopped, waiting for Rio to put a few pieces together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned her head slightly. ‚ÄúWhat year was that?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNinety-Seven.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio remembered dates and years, especially major headlines, even if she had only been eight that year. Her eyes widened. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that the year Agatha‚Äôs mom died in prison?‚Äù She asked cautiously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shrugged. ‚ÄúThe Russians really hate it when you promise them something you can‚Äôt give them, and they lose one of their best assassins. They also love legal favors.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knocked back her wine and poured them a third glass, emptying the bottle. ‚ÄúFuck,
     </span>
<span>
      that‚Äôs information I didn‚Äôt need
     </span>
<span>
      . I‚Äôm going to pretend I didn‚Äôt hear that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I do,
     </span>
<span>
      with a lot of things
     </span>
<span>
      .‚Äù Wanda continued. ‚ÄúAnyway, we were our little trio, Agatha
     </span>
<span>
      sleeping with
     </span>
<span>
      every woman with a pulse. I was, somewhat interested in guys, but not very. I had my relationships, all PR.
     </span>
<span>
      I was not out, and I didn‚Äôt even know I was gay. I was an absolute mess for two years, though. I had very conflicting feelings for Nat. She was my best friend, but more than that, and Nat? She dated other women during those two years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚Äú
     </span>
<span>
      One night in 1999,
     </span>
<span>
      I found myself asking Agatha Harkness,
     </span>
<span>
      this
     </span>
<span>
      lesbian icon and bad boy, how to know if I was into women and, subsequently, if they were into me. That
     </span>
<span>
      lovable
     </span>
<span>
      bitch straight-up laughed at me. I was twenty,
     </span>
<span>
      still so innocent,
     </span>
<span>
      and extremely vulnerable, and the bitch laughed at me.‚Äù Wanda laughed at the memory.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio could imagine a young Agatha, fully knowing what baby gay Wanda was asking, laughing in her face. ‚ÄúSounds like Agatha. Did she tell you to ‚ÄòJust go kiss her, Maximoff‚Äô.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt say kiss, but yes!‚Äù Wanda exclaimed brightly, her native accent was starting to bleed through because of the alcohol. ‚ÄúYou know her so well. Anyway, so I did. I went
     </span>
<span>
      directly to her room. We
     </span>
<span>
      were all living together
     </span>
<span>
      in the original house up on the hill. Her bedroom was right next to mine,
     </span>
<span>
      and much like you and Agatha, we had already been lying to ourselves.‚Äù Wanda gave Rio a knowing look while Rio downed her wine,
     </span>
<span>
      throwing caution to the wind,
     </span>
<span>
      and
     </span>
<span>
      uncorked the second
     </span>
<span>
      bottle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow in question to Wanda, and she nodded, a silent agreement to ditch the glasses.
     </span>
<span>
      Tomorrow was Friday, she could teach with a hangover if she had to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda continued with the story.
     </span>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI crawled into bed with her, something I had done hundreds of times before. It wasn‚Äôt unusual for us to cuddle,
     </span>
<span>
      finding comfort in each other.
     </span>
<span>
      She gave Rio another pointed
     </span>
<span>
      look,
     </span>
<span>
      causing Rio to roll her eyes, huff, and take a drink from the bottle
     </span>
<span>
      . ‚ÄúAnd I cupped her face and kissed her.‚Äù Wanda finished her glass and set it down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat happened next?‚Äù Rio breathed, handing Wanda the bottle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took a drink before responding. ‚ÄúShe kissed me back, and then I cried. I was so afraid to come out. I wasn‚Äôt as established as Agatha, I was already seen as this wholesome girl-next-door, date-the-boy type of star. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. We agreed to just keep it a secret and see what happened.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou were already in love,‚Äù Rio stated, trying to remain serious, though her words were beginning to slur.
     </span>
<span>
      How strong was this wine?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded as a tear fell down her cheek. She wiped it away and continued. ‚ÄúWe kept it hidden for years, Agatha kept telling me there was room in the world for more than one lesbian superstar, but I wouldn‚Äôt listen. I wanted kids, I wanted to live an open life, and so did Natasha. Anytime I brought up coming out, our PR shut it down. That was way before Jen. There were so many arguments and fights. We were madly in love, but I couldn‚Äôt hurt my career. It was all I had
     </span>
<span>
      , or so I thought
     </span>
<span>
      . I kept having
     </span>
<span>
      these bearded and PR relationships, though I didn‚Äôt need them. They really were just to keep the rumors at bay.
     </span>
<span>
      They were all with
     </span>
<span>
      famous men who had gay rumors. After the last one, I had decided I was done, I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore.‚Äù She took the bottle back from Rio, accent
     </span>
<span>
      coming out even more
     </span>
<span>
      . ‚ÄúWe
     </span>
<span>
      might
     </span>
<span>
      need more alcohol. Shit‚Äôs about to get fucking shittastic.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOn it. Eat a snack.‚Äù Rio gestured towards the table in front of them as she gathered the
     </span>
<span>
      empty bottles and glasses, left the half bottle,
     </span>
<span>
      and went to the kitchen. ‚ÄúHow old were you at this point?‚Äù Rio called, words slurring, as she looked in the refrigerator, chose
     </span>
<span>
      two ciders, and fixed two large tumblers of ice water with electrolyte packets
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTwenty-free, I mean, three.‚Äù She called back, giggling at her misspeak, opened a bag of popcorn, and grabbed a handful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed while she opened the wine and came back to the couch, resuming her position. She had done the math and looked at Wanda, understanding why she had been sent to get more
     </span>
<span>
      alcohol even though they had half a bottle left
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou met Vision and things got complicated.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded as she took another drink. ‚ÄúI met Vision. He was consulting on a movie, and for the first time, I actually felt something deep for a man,
     </span>
<span>
      or so I thought
     </span>
<span>
      . Color me startled.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat color is startled?‚Äù Rio took the bottle back and a handful of popcorn herself. She was completely captured by Wanda‚Äôs story and was understanding everyone even more with every word.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúScarlet, I think.‚Äù Wanda resituated her legs before continuing. ‚ÄúNat and I had kept things so under wraps, Vis had no idea I liked women. He was so sweet and caring. Leave it to me to fall for the two most amazing, understanding, selfless people in the world at the same damn time.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat did you tell Aga‚Ä¶Nat?‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs
     </span>
<span>
      sapphics were running together with her increased blood alcohol content.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have to. She came to me. She wasn‚Äôt mad, she wasn‚Äôt jealous. She just took me in her arms and asked me what I wanted. I was falling in love with someone else,
     </span>
<span>
      again, or so I thought at the time,
     </span>
<span>
      and the woman I also loved, who was madly in love with me, asked me what I wanted. She asked me what would make me happy. I was twenty-four, I didn‚Äôt know, and I told her that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI told her that I was in love with both of them, but that wasn‚Äôt fair to either of them. That beautiful woman looked at me and said that she would always be with me, even if it wasn‚Äôt the way that she wanted to be. That she would always be mine, even if I wasn‚Äôt completely hers. My heart shattered that night.‚Äù Wanda grabbed another tissue,
     </span>
<span>
      a pile of them already
     </span>
<span>
      in her lap. Raven had jumped down when she had shifted positions earlier.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat did Vision say?‚Äù Rio asked, a tissue in her hand as well.
     </span>
<span>
      The second bottle was now gone, and they had moved on to their ciders, an unspoken agreement that they were done after that.
     </span>
<span>
      They were slurring words,
     </span>
<span>
      and Rio
     </span>
<span>
      was proud she could understand Wanda through
     </span>
<span>
      her now
     </span>
<span>
      heavy accent, and tears were flowing
     </span>
<span>
      from both.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat he understood. Can you believe
     </span>
<span>
      that asshole
     </span>
<span>
      ? So I went to Agatha. She knew everything,
     </span>
<span>
      of course
     </span>
<span>
      , she had been the support for Nat and me both, but never caught in the middle. She, of course, had her own brand of dry humor, and we listened to a lot of Melissa Etheridge and Indigo Girls. She told me that I had to do what I felt was right for me and what I could live with. I had to decide if I could live with potentially losing my fans. She had built her career on being gay. I hadn‚Äôt. However, fuck the people I lost because my happiness was worth everything.‚Äù Wanda‚Äôs eyes were watery.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew what happened next. She remembered the grainy pictures. She and Alice had been teenagers and were shocked when they saw the headlines in their favorite tabloids of the time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen the pictures broke,‚Äù Rio said softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was twenty-four? Twenty-five? Vis and I were officially dating. Nat remained on security, of course, when that grainy picture of Nat and I making out at a concert was splashed everywhere.‚Äù Wanda sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYour engagement was announced soon after,‚Äù Rio whispered, remembering.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. ‚ÄúPR‚Äôs idea. Vis said we could call the whole idea off. He wasn‚Äôt even mad.
     </span>
<span>
      Nat and I were still dating, we just kept it a secret like we had been.
     </span>
<span>
      It was a moment of weakness, we were at The Killers concert and got caught up in the moment.
     </span>
<span>
      Nat and I always do at concerts, music is important to us.
     </span>
<span>
      However, studios had already started calling
     </span>
<span>
      with questions, worried about their bottom line and how this would affect it and current projects.
     </span>
<span>
      It was a nightmare. I had to make a statement that it wasn‚Äôt a kiss, it was an entire thing. Anyway, we were married in
     </span>
<span>
      early
     </span>
<span>
      2005,
     </span>
<span>
      shortly after I turned twenty-six
     </span>
<span>
      .‚Äù Wanda blew her nose and placed the empty popcorn bag on the table.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow did Nat take it?‚Äù Rio couldn‚Äôt imagine watching the person she was in love with marry someone else.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHard. She understood, but she hated it. She stayed by my side though, always mine, never hers.‚Äù Wanda swallowed a sob. ‚ÄúSo we went through the first few years. I really
     </span>
<span>
      thought I
     </span>
<span>
      was in love with Vision then. My star rose, I won awards, and the public forgot about my ‚Äòlesbian scare‚Äô. Agatha had Nicky, and Vis could tell I was less than happy. So we started trying for a baby and had the twins. I remember wishing that they had been Nat‚Äôs
     </span>
<span>
      , though she had been there for everything
     </span>
<span>
      . She would have been such a great mother.‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      Wanda knew that Nat couldn‚Äôt have children, not something she would be telling Rio. The closest Nat would come to having kids was the boys, but Wanda so badly wished at that moment that it had been different
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAs it was, Vis knew
     </span>
<span>
      the role Nat played
     </span>
<span>
      . He always knew, it‚Äôs like they had some unspoken agreement. I had three people doting on me while I was pregnant.
     </span>
<span>
      As I‚Äôm sure you can guess, Agatha was the third
     </span>
<span>
      .‚Äù Wanda
     </span>
<span>
      smiled
     </span>
<span>
      at the memories, a small mountain of crumbled tissues in her lap.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNatasha Romanov is a great father, I mean mother,‚Äù Rio told her. ‚ÄúThose boys have three moms and a dad, and they,
     </span>
<span>
      and all adults,
     </span>
<span>
      know it. She would move planets for those boys, you, and even for Vision if she thought it would make you happy.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda gave a watery smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, and she has. She
     </span>
<span>
      also
     </span>
<span>
      refuses to date
     </span>
<span>
      anyone else
     </span>
<span>
      , no matter how much I tell her to.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou would hate it if she did.‚Äù They were well past drinking now, trying to sober up a little, still slurring words here and there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. ‚ÄúIt would kill me. Just as I know it kills her to see me
     </span>
<span>
      live the life we dreamed of, but with someone else
     </span>
<span>
      .‚Äù She took another breath. ‚ÄúAround the time the boys turned one, and I‚Äôd been married for six years,
     </span>
<span>
      I started to get restless
     </span>
<span>
      .‚Äù Wanda saw the look on Rio‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúI know, it‚Äôs been thirteen years since then, yes. Vis knows
     </span>
<span>
      how I feel
     </span>
<span>
      , but he‚Äôs never said anything. He gives me my girl time
     </span>
<span>
      and my Nat time
     </span>
<span>
      . He‚Äôs an amazing husband and father.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚Äú
     </span>
<span>
      We have an agreement. Kisses, chaste touches. I think Vis would be okay if Nat and I were fully together, but that‚Äôs not fair to him, and I can‚Äôt be dishonest. I can‚Äôt break our vows. They mean something to me. I also can‚Äôt risk that leaking. I‚Äôm walking a tight line as it is.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHe deserves to be happy. I‚Äôm just so afraid of hurting the boys, and at this point, I‚Äôve sacrificed so much for this life, for my career. I hurt two people that I love, albeit in different ways, and I don‚Äôt want to do it again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hurt him, and at the same time, I‚Äôm not in love with him anymore,
     </span>
<span>
      if I ever really was
     </span>
<span>
      . I am still madly in love with her, just as much as I was when we were 20. I‚Äôve been in love with her for 25 years, Rio, and all I have to show for that is a few years where we were truly together, and decades of stolen moments. I want her. I want her to be the one doing homework time with me, her to be the one helping me in the kitchen, walking red carpets, and hugging me when I win awards. I want to stand up at that podium holding an Oscar and say ‚Äòthank you to my wife for always believing in me‚Äô, not just knowing I mean her when I mention my friends and family.‚Äù Wanda‚Äôs tears were flowing freely again, as were Rio‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI also feel like I stole twenty years of their lives, Rio. That‚Äôs twenty years neither of them can get back.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned forward and hugged her, Wanda hugging her back, burying her face into Rio‚Äôs shoulder. They stayed that way for a few minutes before Rio drew back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda wiped her face and looked at Rio through bloodshot eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs too late?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at her with disbelief. ‚ÄúHave you seen the way she looks at you? Nat is as madly in love with you as you are with her. The decision you have to make is, are you willing to do this?
     </span>
<span>
      I mean, really do this.
     </span>
<span>
      Live your truth? There‚Äôs no keeping this secret. Not with two teenage boys and as famous as you are, social media, everything. You obviously have to talk with your husband, but Wanda. You‚Äôve been living your own personal ‚ÄòGood Luck, Babe‚Äô your entire adult life. You deserve good things, and you deserve happiness. How do you expect to set that example for your boys if you don‚Äôt do it for yourself? Billy is gay if you haven‚Äôt noticed. How do you think he‚Äôd react if you kept this hidden for another 30 years? A good half of the public already thinks you're fucking Agatha, there‚Äôs a subsection that already ships you and Nat. All of THAT aside, you have to live for YOU, Wanda. We can all see that you‚Äôre driving yourself insane.
     </span>
<span>
      You‚Äôve been spiraling the entire time I‚Äôve known you, and you two aren‚Äôt subtle.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou have not stolen time from either of them. Vision will always support you, and Natasha? Wanda, honey, the moment you are able to, we aren‚Äôt going to hear from either of you for at least a week. She only has eyes for you.
     </span>
<span>
      Talk to your husband, get your woman. As you said, she will always be yours, go be hers.‚Äù Rio finished and handed Wanda a new Kleenex.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked at the pile of tissues in her lap. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, you know.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI usually am.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhen will you follow your own advice and go after your happiness?‚Äù Wanda asked, not completely innocently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here about me right now. I have my own tragic story, but tonight isn‚Äôt that night.‚Äù Rio said, putting a hand on Wanda‚Äôs knee and squeezing. Wanda
     </span>
<span>
      returned a slight nod
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have some things to do as it is. Like, get home and talk to my husband
     </span>
<span>
      for starters
     </span>
<span>
      .‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
      Wanda exhaled a shaky breath and texted her driver.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave Wanda a long hug goodbye and wished her luck, telling her to update her as soon as she had one. Wanda promised she would and thanked her before
     </span>
<span>
      walking to the car, only stumbling twice.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio cleaned up, turning off lights throughout the apartment as she stumbled to her room herself. Once she had finished the bedtime routine and gotten situated, making sure to take Tylenol to head off any ill effects in the morning, she realized it was 2 am in New York, and she hadn‚Äôt texted Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tonight with Wanda had been an eye-opener. She knew that something was going on between the two redheads, but a 25-year-long affair of sorts? That she hadn‚Äôt expected. She thought about her feelings towards Agatha. Was she living her truth? Was she being honest with herself?
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      That was believable. She had promised Wanda she wouldn‚Äôt tell Agatha about tonight until Wanda was ready for her to know. Rio and Wanda were even closer now, and considering how much Wanda meant to Agatha, Rio would keep her promises. This family Rio had been

      If Agatha said it first, then she could say it back, and they were absolutely close enough that it was time to use her nickname. This was a start.

      Agatha ran into Nat‚Äôs room
     </span>

      at the Manhattan apartment that she and Wanda owned, jumping
     </span>
<span>
      on her bed

     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe said she missed me too and called me Aggie!‚Äù Agatha said uncharacteristically. She was well past buzzed.

      ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt date teachers,

      Nat grinned as her phone dinged, and she picked it up to check

      When Wanda returned home that night, Vision had been waiting for her in their bedroom, reading a book, knowing what was coming. He had anticipated this moment for the past twenty years of their lives and had noticed Wanda‚Äôs increasing distance, her frequent absences if the boys weren‚Äôt around, and the increased girl time. He gave her the space and time she needed. He would always love her, but he also knew what this had been and he had been grateful for it, but if she hadn‚Äôt come forward soon, he was going to. He deserved true happiness as much as she did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There had been tears and conversation, but absolutely zero hard feelings on his side. They agreed to wait until after the holidays to tell the boys, and Wanda needed to talk to Jen about how they would approach the media. They would work out co-parenting and divorce details later. Neither planned on being nasty about it and they had been more like roommates than anything for a long time. Vision had joked about giving Nat the same shovel talk she had given him once, except she actually could make him disappear without a trace. Wanda had just smiled. She had sent that text to Nat before talking to Vision, knowing Nat wouldn‚Äôt respond. Nat would want to have that conversation in person. She also knew what Agatha would do.

</p>
<p>

      Wanda laughed and rolled her eyes. Of course, they both read in between the lines.

      Nat had barely made it into Agatha‚Äôs house before Wanda had jumped in her arms, legs around her waist. She hugged her before kissing her deeply, sliding her hand to cup Nat‚Äôs jaw. Nat lowered Wanda slowly to her feet, careful not to break the kiss, running her tongue across her bottom lip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha cleared her throat, causing the two women to break their kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked into Wanda‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúYes, you can be mine.‚Äù She answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda just nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha clapped her hands together, walking past them. ‚ÄúGreat, now that that‚Äôs cleared up. Jen will be here in an hour, football game this evening, and kid?‚Äù She turned to Wanda, ‚ÄúI am so proud of you.‚Äù She winked before ascending the stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWHAT?!‚Äù Jen exclaimed out of excitement, surprise, and confusion. There were a lot of emotions, and she said as much. ‚ÄúWanda, I am so glad you are finally clearing up your decades-long situationship, I am. But right now? Right before awards season? You just signed with Marvel!‚Äù Jen wasn‚Äôt sure how she was going to spin this, package it, anything. Wanda and Vision had been one of Hollywood‚Äôs very few long-lasting couples.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúJen. Look, Wanda coming out of the closet will not surprise many. Marvel is going the way of queer anyway, so is Disney. We spin it positively. I‚Äôm gay and not at all monogamous, and they signed me. Everything will be fine. Our new movie? Wanda and I literally play lovers and have very convincing sex in it. Calm your tits Kale, or let Alice do it for you.‚Äù She smirked, eliciting a blush and an eye-roll. ‚ÄúBesides, America‚Äôs Stepford Couple will not announce it to the kids, let alone the rest of the world, until after the holidays. Nat and Wanda will just be more open and cuddly around us, but still play it cool everywhere else. Don‚Äôt expect them to go gaying it up everywhere else yet, okay? That‚Äôs my job.‚Äù Agatha explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked a lot calmer. ‚ÄúOkay, that makes me feel‚Ä¶oddly better.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The couple in question was sitting together looking like two teenagers who had just told their parents that the condom had failed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at them both. ‚ÄúI am very happy for both of you. Truly.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda beamed. ‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù She turned to Nat and kissed her cheek. ‚ÄúAre you okay with this?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat turned and looked at her. ‚ÄúI finally get you, Wanda -body, soul, home, and publically? Yes. I‚Äôm okay with it.‚Äù She gave her a chaste kiss as Agatha groaned again, smiling this time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNow there‚Äôs two lovesick couples? Gross.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen waved her hands out in front of her. ‚ÄúNo one said anything about love. Alice and I are taking it slow. It‚Äôs a very strong like.‚Äù She denied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDebatable,‚Äù Wanda teased. ‚ÄúTo be fair, I‚Äôve loved Nat for 25 years.‚Äù Nat just nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, but now you guys will be all open about it.‚Äù Agatha grimaced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRight, and you and Rio don‚Äôt look at each other like middle schoolers discovering their first crush,‚Äù Nat said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was proud of Wanda for finally coming to this decision. She knew it was one Wanda would make eventually, but was surprised Wanda hadn‚Äôt talked to her about it first. She had been just as shocked as Nat was when she received that text last night. She would either ask Wanda about it or Wanda would come to her, however, she suspected Wanda had talked to a certain brunette, and that made her heart soar that her sister was confiding in her new‚Ä¶close friend.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Friend.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe need to make sure that your girlfriends are on the same page,‚Äù Wanda said, seeing if Agatha caught what she said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôll text Alice now,‚Äù Jen said, side-eyeing Agatha, waiting for the response.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôll text Ri,‚Äù Agatha said automatically. Her eyes suddenly went wide as it hit her. ‚ÄúSHE IS NOT MY GIRLFRIEND!‚Äù She yelled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat fell into Wanda‚Äôs lap from laughing so hard.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOnly ALICE calls her RI!‚Äù Wanda shouted back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen texted every word to Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Across town, Alice broke out into laughter while half her class did makeup work, and the other half debated the believability of various movies their parents starred in.

      September ended and bled into October, Homecoming Week at SHIELD. For some reason, the powers that be, one Coach Rogers, thought that it would be a good idea to play their rivals for the big game. Bayside High. The schools had exchanged pranks and taunts for decades, and this year was no different. SHIELD may have been a K-12 school with a unique student body, but it still had a high school with teenagers with a penchant for bad decision-making. Nicky Harkness and Tommy Maximoff had surprisingly stayed out of trouble so far this year, surprising everyone. They had also met two girls from Bayside and asked them to the Homecoming dance that upcoming weekend after finding out that the guys they usually hung out with were pretty douchey.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was how Nicky and Tommy ended up on A.C. Slater and Zack Morris‚Äôs radar. It didn‚Äôt help that Slater was also Bayside‚Äôs star quarterback and Morris was their star running back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tensions that week had been running high. Teachers were on alert, security teams were on alert, and even parents were on alert. Dressup days were decades-themed, and there were different events held every day. While Rio always enjoyed themed weeks and homecoming in general, she was not looking forward to quarterly exams the following week. However, it was a necessary evil to get to the fall break, which kicked off her series of events with Agatha. The premiere, NYC weekend with SNL, and then Halloween.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had been looking forward to the second half of October since it had been decided over Labor Day weekend, and she found herself daydreaming about it. She was also anxious about spending a weekend, just the two of them, in New York. They would be staying at Agatha‚Äôs place, and while she could stay in the guest room, she knew where she would actually sleep. Her feelings for Agatha kept growing and becoming harder to ignore. Every touch, every lingering glance, every time she was so close to Agatha that she could hear her breathing and smell the scent of her skin. She needed to at least share with Agatha why she had her rule in place. She just worried that once that was all out in the open, Agatha would see her differently. That scared her almost as much as losing her did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Thankfully, other than some trash-talking online and at the game, everything had gone smoothly between the two schools. While there had been several almost fights among players, students, and parents, nothing had happened at the game. The players were at a celebratory after-game party, and the six women were at Agatha‚Äôs. Agatha was still on high alert, however, just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI just feel like something‚Äôs going to happen,‚Äù Agatha said for the fourth or fifth time since they had been at her house. Each pair of women had a designated couch now. Agatha and Rio had the middle couch, Nat and Wanda to their left, and Alice and Jen on their right. They had gotten pizza, and their various drinks were scattered around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAggie,‚Äù Nat started ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs security with the boys, and they‚Äôre fine.‚Äù She reassured her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo they‚Äôre going to a high school dance with girls from a rival school who are technically dating football players from the other team. What‚Äôs the worst that could happen?‚Äù Jen teased. ‚ÄúDid they learn that from you, Harkness?‚Äù She added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMother, son, and nephew bonding?‚Äù Rio asked before looking over at Wanda. ‚ÄúYou need better role models for your sons, Maximoff.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúEt, tu, Brute?‚Äù Agatha looked at Rio, feigning shock and hurt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice laughed. ‚ÄúAt least they know how to fight.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúReal reassuring everyone,‚Äù Agatha said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúUsually, I‚Äôm the one that worries, and I‚Äôm not worried,‚Äù Wanda said nonchalantly, snuggling up against Nat with a yawn.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAs long as I can focus on positive PR, I‚Äôm good,‚Äù Jen added, her arm around Alice, smiling at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all disgusting,‚Äù Agatha murmured. Rio was pressed against her side, and if anyone who didn‚Äôt know their status saw them, they would assume they too, were dating. The painful truth tore at Agatha. She was getting close to wanting to ditch her rule of not dating parents. There weren‚Äôt many rules Agatha was afraid of breaking or bending. She had done a lot of things to survive and get where she was today. This, however, was more for her son. The no relationships period rule was for her. She had had one relationship in her life, and it had gone poorly. No one knew about it, and only Wanda knew snippets. Hell, Wanda didn‚Äôt even know who the woman was. It would always be Agatha‚Äôs secret.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had to get to a point where she could share that with Rio, and she didn‚Äôt know if she could.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys and their dates were taking pictures around the compound and looked adorable. Tommy, Nicky, Billy, and Billy‚Äôs ‚Äòfriend‚Äô, Eddie, were wearing matching suits. Tommy‚Äôs date, a girl named Kelly from Bayside, was wearing a silver spaghetti strap dress with a sweetheart neckline and a flared skirt that came to her knees. She had matching silver heels, and her hair was pulled up. Tommy had a matching silver vest and bowtie with his suit to match. Jessie‚Äôs dress was a strapless purple number that managed to be fitted but appropriate for a sixteen-year-old. She had black heels, and her hair reminded Agatha of her own, long, wild curls with a mind of their own. Nicky‚Äôs vest and bowtie were purple to match Jessie‚Äôs dress, and Agatha teared up at how he looked simultaneously grown up and like he was still her little boy. Then there was Billy and Eddie. Billy had a blue vest and red bow tie, and Eddie with a blue bow tie and red vest. The six of them all looked amazing. The three women who had known Nicky and the twins since birth had tears in their eyes. Even Rio was tearing up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took pictures and sent them to Alice, even though she and Jen were out on their own date.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After the pictures, the teenagers left for dinner and the dance. Everything had gone fine the night before after the game, and Agatha was still oddly anxious waiting for something bad to happen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The last pictures they had taken were taken on a balcony at Agatha‚Äôs house, and they had all come back through the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting a drink,‚Äù Agatha announced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe are going to Nat‚Äôs place for date night since we can do that,‚Äù Wanda stated, grabbing Nat‚Äôs hand and leading her towards the door. ‚ÄúLove you both, have fun, confess your feelings, bye!‚Äù She said, closing the door behind them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a bitch, and there‚Äôs nothing to confess!‚Äù Agatha yelled before the door closed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was leaning against the bar with her face buried in her hands, ears pink. ‚ÄúWhy do they keep doing this shit?‚Äù She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAt this point, it‚Äôs just poking the bear,‚Äù Agatha said, pouring whiskey into her coke, handing one to Rio. ‚ÄúCheers to shitty friends that mean well.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She lifted her head, taking the glass with one hand and putting the other on the cool marble of the bar. ‚ÄúCheers,‚Äù Rio said, lifting her glass as she clinked it against Agatha‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They turned and assumed their usual positions on the couch, their sides pressed against each other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio poked her tongue in her cheek, trying to decide if she wanted to stay in safe waters or go deeper. She had so many things she wanted to ask, but she wasn‚Äôt sure if she was ready to cross into those territories quite yet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha decided for both of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat are you wearing to the premiere?‚Äù Agatha asked, trying to sound innocent.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at her, pretend shock on her face. ‚ÄúYou know good and well that I have been sworn to secrecy, and no one is allowed to say anything!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had given them all very specific instructions not to tell each other what they were wearing. They were all getting ready together, and they would see then, but for some reason, it was very hush-hush until then. Agatha didn‚Äôt understand it either, and she had been doing this her whole life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe are riding together. We are getting ready together with the same make-up and hair team, at my house. I do not understand why we can‚Äôt tell each other. Yet, just to prepare you, it‚Äôs this way for every red-carpet event. Whether it‚Äôs a premiere or an awards show.‚Äù Agatha looked over at her to gauge her reaction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio met her gaze, trying to read the look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy would you need to prepare me?‚Äù Rio asked, searching her eyes. She needed Agatha to confirm it,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Agatha was trying to put it in just the right words. ‚ÄúFor any future awards shows or premieres, I was hoping you would go with me. As my new standing red carpet buddy. Wanda will probably start showing off her not exactly new girlfriend, and Nicky is getting too cool to go with his mom‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off, she hadn‚Äôt broken eye contact with Rio, and while she was trying to play it off, her eyes were soft and drew her in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew this was Agatha‚Äôs way of asking her to stay in her life, a commitment of sorts. Rio nodded, her own eyes were a reflection of Agatha‚Äôs. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù She whispered. She didn‚Äôt know when they had leaned into one another or how they had, once again, gotten this dangerously close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could feel Rio‚Äôs breath on her face and her body was buzzing everywhere it connected with Rio‚Äôs. She so badly wanted to cross that line, but if they were going to do that, some things needed to be said first, and that wasn‚Äôt happening tonight. She quickly turned and stood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI need another drink? Do you?‚Äù She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, clearing her head. ‚ÄúJust water.‚Äù Water was much safer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had fallen asleep watching The Craft, Rio tucked against Agatha, her arms around her, when Agatha‚Äôs phone rang. She jolted awake and looked at the time. It was only 10:30 and she hadn‚Äôt heard Nicky come in, she grabbed the phone and saw Lilia Calderu‚Äôs name on the screen, which shocked her into alertness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLilia? What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had woken up when Agatha‚Äôs phone went off. When she heard the panic in her voice and the name, she grabbed her shoes and phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be right there.‚Äù Agatha hung up and went to call Wanda, only to see that Rio was hanging up her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWanda and Nat are on the way here, and we‚Äôll go to the school together. Wanda‚Äôs calling Vis.‚Äù She said, grabbing their purses.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Agatha asked as they headed to the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYour voice, the look on your face, and I could hear everything Lilia said through the phone.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo you know the Bayside football players showed up, and there was a fight?‚Äù Agatha relayed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes. She didn‚Äôt say how serious it was. Shouldn‚Äôt be too bad, though.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When the four women reached the school, Jen was already there in full PR mode, as were a few other PR reps for some other families. As it turned out, it was worse than they thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

      Nicky, Tommy, and a few other football players from both the varsity and junior varsity teams had decided to stop by Bayside on the way to the dance. The victory the night before had been solid, 28 -7, and they had learned about some rather degrading treatment of the girls on campus by boys across the school in general. The SHIELD team took it upon themselves to cross out ‚ÄòTigers‚Äô on the field, replaced it with ‚Äòpussycats‚Äô, and stole the head of their mascot‚Äôs costume, flying it up the flagpole on the SHIELD campus. They had used paint that would wash off the field easily and planned to return the head on Monday. No major damage and it was all pretty harmless. The problem came when the Bayside football team crashed the dance as students were departing, and a fight broke out in the parking lot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was more worried about legal ramifications and the physical well-being of the kids than anything else, which was what Wanda and most parents were also worried about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNicholas, are you okay?‚Äù She asked, rushing to where he was sitting in the clinic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, Mom. Slater won‚Äôt be able to open his left eye for a while though,‚Äù he said with a small smile and winced when she hugged him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNicky? What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù She asked, alarm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt block correctly and took a blow to the ribcage,‚Äù Nat said, storming in. ‚ÄúI checked the cameras, and have already had a word with security.‚Äù Her accent was thick as she joined Wanda and Vision with the twins.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head. ‚ÄúWill you and Tommy please not start shit?‚Äù She asked, checking him over for any other damages.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky just scoffed as he looked down. Rio had sidled up next to Agatha and had a comforting hand on her lower back, helping to ease her anxiety. It had worked, as Agatha wasn‚Äôt shaking as she had been before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put her hand on Nicky‚Äôs shoulder and squeezed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad you and your cousins didn‚Äôt get seriously hurt.‚Äù She smiled at him, and he returned it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew how they looked right now, and she didn‚Äôt care. Let people talk. Jen could spin it to be like another Wagatha situation. Why that stung her, she wasn‚Äôt sure.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       You know why.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Her inner voice said. She ignored it as she put her arm around Rio‚Äôs waist and gave her a quick side hug.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No one was pressing charges, though there had been a heated debate over who had been in the wrong and what the appropriate consequences were. Security footage proved that Bayside had attacked first and SHIELD students had defended. Tommy had a few scrapes and bruises but was fine. Billy had stayed out of it. A few other students were a little scuffed up. Students were picked up, and the excitement died down. Agatha had left the clinic and joined Lilia in dealing with the few police officers who had shown up. Wanda and Vision gathered the twins to go home, letting Rio know, while Nat figured out exactly why security had been nowhere to be found during the scuffle. Jen and a few other reps were scrubbing pictures off of social media, Alice was talking with the teachers who had chaperoned the event, and Rio was sitting with Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYour mother was worried.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúWhat
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       actually
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      happened?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou know what I mean.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThose guys are real jerks. It‚Äôs funny how people think we‚Äôre these elitist snobs, or completely out of touch, but we‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre the ones who don‚Äôt know how to treat people.‚Äù He said, looking at the ground. They were sitting in the office lobby now, an ice pack on his rib cage. ‚ÄúThe girls over there aren‚Äôt treated nicely by the guys and they say mean things to the LGBTQ+ kids‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like a stereotypical high school you see on TV, Rio.‚Äù He looked like a lost puppy, hurt to discover the world's injustices.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know, kid. I‚Äôll make sure to tell Lilia, and maybe she can talk to the principal. What could you do about it? How could you spread awareness about how not to be a teenage douchecanoe? You‚Äôre the child of one of the most famous people in the world. You have a platform.‚Äù She knew he wanted to make a difference and knew that he could if he wanted to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDo you honestly believe that? That I could inspire others?‚Äù He asked, looking hopeful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYour mom is Agatha Fucking Harkness, kid. Which makes you Nicholas Fucking Harkness. You are unstoppable.‚Äù She grinned and ruffled his hair. ‚ÄúYou can do anything.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had watched the exchange, and while she wasn‚Äôt sure what was said, she could see it had been a heartfelt conversation that ended in grins and her son being comforted by the woman she was falling for.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe is just as scared, hurt, and cautious as you are. If you would just open up and take a chance, you might find love again.‚Äù Lilia said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha jumped. She had no idea when the woman had drawn up beside her, but here she was in all of her wisdom. Agatha looked around, noticing that everyone had left or was in the process of doing so.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat are the consequences?‚Äù Completely ignoring what the principal had said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFor the boys? They‚Äôll clean up Bayside‚Äôs field tomorrow and do whatever exercises Rogers has for them. However, I believe Nicky has something to tell me, and an investigation into student conduct will be open at Bayside. He‚Äôs a good kid with a good heart. Like his mother, despite her rough exterior,‚Äù she looked over at Agatha. ‚ÄúFor you? Well, if you don‚Äôt finally open up, then you lose that amazing woman in there, and you go back to your old ways, and you‚Äôre as miserable as you ever were. If you do open up and get rid of that stupid rule? Well, hopefully, she follows suit and everything works out.‚Äù Lilia looked back at Rio, who was looking at things on her phone with Nicky and pointing at something on the screen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not talking in riddles right now. Why?‚Äù She looked over questioningly. Lilia was rarely this candid.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou know why. Now take those two and go home, Agatha.‚Äù With that, Lilia turned and left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just shook her head and walked through the doors into the office. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, you two. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù She smiled and led the way out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they rode back to the compound, Agatha thought about the night's events. Rio had stayed. She had called Wanda automatically without hesitating, hadn‚Äôt once complained, had swooped in, comforted Nicky, sat with him, and waited with him. Even now, Nicky had fallen asleep leaning on Rio. This woman, who had only been in their lives for two months, had stepped up, been a calming presence, and shown up for both of them without being asked.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Like a partner would.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was two a.m. by the time they got home. Nicky hugged Rio and thanked her, before hugging Agatha and whispering ‚ÄòI like her‚Äô in his mom‚Äôs ear. He waved and went upstairs to bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio yawned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to head out myself.‚Äù She grabbed her bag and turned before Agatha caught her arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long night and a rough one at that. Will you‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha hated being vulnerable, and she had never actually asked Rio to stay before. It just had worked out that way. Rio turned, looking at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew that they were in deep at this point. Very deep. To the point that they would soon need oxygen masks. The normally collected woman before her was anything but. While the night's events had turned out to be a minor innocent, Rio had seen the panic and fear on Agatha‚Äôs face and heard it in her voice. She could see the adrenaline wearing off and knew that she was still in need of comfort. The great Agatha Harkness, as rough around the edges as she could be, just needed someone to hold her and tell her everything was going to be okay. At that moment, Rio desperately wanted to be that person for her. She would take away all of her pain, trauma, and fear if she could.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Forever and Always.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She just nodded before responding. ‚ÄúOkay, Agatha.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew that it would have been so easy to close the gap between them right now. To cup Agatha‚Äôs face before sliding her hands into her hair as she kissed her, and damn. She wanted to. She wanted to feel her lips against her, wanted to explore her mouth with her tongue, bite her lip, swallow her moans...
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       No. You can‚Äôt risk it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha thought for a moment and knew she had to think quickly. She was vulnerable, what Lilia had said was still fresh in her mind, and yet, she didn‚Äôt want to fuck anything up. If she and Rio went upstairs, she wouldn‚Äôt be able to trust herself not to do something stupid. The couch was the safer option of the two. Letting Rio go home had been the better option, but she needed her. Honestly, she and Rio needed to be on different continents to be safest, yet here they were.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She led Rio to the couch and they positioned themselves in a way that Agatha had her back leaning against Rio‚Äôs chest, Rio‚Äôs legs on either side of Agatha, Rio‚Äôs back against the arm of the couch. Rio played with Agatha‚Äôs hair as they turned on a random TV show.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat were you and Nicky talking about?‚Äù Agatha asked, remembering how intently they had been speaking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh! Something is happening at Bayside. We need to talk to Calderu. Nicky said that it‚Äôs a very typical high school like you would see on TV; bullying, homophobia, misogyny. He wants to do something about it, and we talked about how he can use his proximity to fame to rally other teens to use their collective voices and be a force for change. He‚Äôs such a great kid. You should be so proud of yourself, Aggie,‚Äù Rio‚Äôs voice was full of admiration and awe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs heart swelled, not only because of Nicky but because of how Rio had talked about him. ‚ÄúThank you for being there for him. That meant a lot to me. Just the way that you jumped in and took control of everything.‚Äù She was thankful that Rio couldn't see her face as she bit back tears. ‚ÄúNot many people would have done that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI care about you both, you‚Äôre‚Ä¶important to me, Agatha. With that comes Nicky. I‚Äôm fond of the kid, whether I‚Äôm his teacher or not. He‚Äôs an extension of you. I‚Äôm going to treat him like he‚Äôs mine.‚Äù She smoothed the ends of Agatha‚Äôs hair.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       You might as well tattoo ‚ÄòJust Friends‚Äô on your foreheads at this point to remind yourselves.‚Äô
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      It was one of the many reasons this couldn‚Äôt go any further. She couldn‚Äôt hurt Nicky like that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The words ‚Äòlike he‚Äôs mine‚Äô stayed with Agatha and landed, like so many other things with Rio, in her heart. It‚Äôs what she had wanted, wasn‚Äôt it? Someone who truly cared about them both? Someone who wasn‚Äôt there to try and be a second parent necessarily but wasn‚Äôt afraid to love and guide him either?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maybe they could just wait until Nicky graduated Agatha thought. Jen and Alice had waited years to finally get together, and Nat waited twenty years to fully get Wanda back. It was less than two years, and as smart as Nicky was, he could probably graduate earlier. Then she would just need to find a way to open up about why she had shied away from relationships. No, they wouldn‚Äôt make it that long, either. They were doing a bad job at making the two-month mark.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Useless lesbians.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Despite her inner turmoil, the adrenaline had worn off and Agatha couldn‚Äôt resist sleep anymore, not while Rio absentmindedly played with her hair, the smell of Rio‚Äôs eucalyptus shampoo filling her nostrils.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt Agatha‚Äôs body become heavier against hers, knowing she had succumbed to sleep. She knew Agatha needed it and was glad she had finally let herself find it. Meanwhile, Rio was mid-crisis. She was attempting to suppress feelings and recreate boundaries, but those lines were all but erased at this point. She managed to sleep for a few hours, but only due to her personal Agatha-shaped weighted blanket.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She remembered they had shifted in their sleep and was not entirely surprised to wake up sandwiched between the back of the couch and Agatha. Agatha‚Äôs back was flush against Rio‚Äôs front, Rio‚Äôs arm over her middle, Agatha holding her hand. She breathed in the familiar lavender scent that she now associated with the woman in her arms and let herself to just be. It was moments like this when Rio didn't have to be scared of Agatha, the possibility of them together, and all the ways it could go horribly wrong. Rio relaxed, imagining all the good without the risk of the bad.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before she fell asleep again, Rio wiggled away, grateful that Agatha was such a heavy sleeper. Rio quietly gathered her things and left. She needed to prepare for the final week before break and had things to think about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As she glanced back at Agatha, sleeping peacefully, she tried to crystalize the scene and how happy she felt right now in her heart and mind.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I can't lose her
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , she thought.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       No matter what I am feeling, I have to turn it off. It can't turn out that way again
      </span>

      Rio found herself storming into Alice‚Äôs apartment Sunday evening after a day of preparing for mid-terms and quarterly finals. She had also been reflecting on her feelings all day. She was happy being Agatha‚Äôs friend, she really was. There were also feelings there, and she needed to get them out and talk to the one person she could always count on to help her keep a level head. The one person who knew everything. She sent Alice a quick text to let her know she was coming over in case Jen had been there. Rio was agitated and had to get out her frustrations. It was impossible to turn these feelings off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen was sitting cross-legged in an armchair, typing statements from last night's teenage shenanigans. Alice was on the couch and offered Rio a cider, which she declined.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôve had enough alcohol the past two months. Maybe I need to stop drinking. Maybe I need to keep a clear head.‚Äù She said, agitated, as she gestured wildly while pacing around the living room. She had sat much of the day while preparing for the week and now Rio needed to move.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at Alice and raised an eyebrow. Alice shook her head once. She knew Rio and knew she needed to let everything out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt date parents. I don‚Äôt. We both know there‚Äôs a fucking good reason for that. That two-year affair in San Francisco nearly KILLED me, Alice, you saw me. You came to the hospital and saw me.‚Äù She realized that Jen was present and quickly turned to look at her. ‚ÄúSay a damn word of any of this to anyone, and I‚Äôll make a phone call to Nat. She owes me a favor,‚Äù She said, pointing a finger in Jen‚Äôs direction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at Rio with confusion for a moment. ‚ÄúWhy would Nat‚Ä¶‚Äù the pieces clicked for her. ‚ÄúOH! You‚Äôre the one, got it,‚Äù Jen nodded, waving her hand for her to continue.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNothing leaves this apartment,‚Äù Rio added, watching as the other two women nodded their agreement. She continued her movements around the room. ‚ÄúYes, I know this is different, but I almost lost my career. I don‚Äôt want another relationship to almost cost me everything again. I don‚Äôt want a breakup to cause me to lose a friend, which is the most important part of this dilemma. She means so much to me. I can tell her almost anything. I can‚Äôt lose that! I can‚Äôt lose this coven of lovable bitches either.‚Äù Her gestures were wild, and she roamed every space in the main area of the apartment. This was not a new experience for Alice as her eyes tracked Rio around the room. Jen, however, was amused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Do you know what she asked me last night? She asked me to be her consistent date for red carpet events. Agatha. Agatha Fucking Harkness, who always takes Wanda ‚ÄòIn Love With the Deadliest Woman Alive‚Äô Maximoff or her own son, wants me to be her forever red-carpet buddy. You know, as FRIENDS. I can count on one hand the number of times she has taken someone that wasn‚Äôt one of those two since I‚Äôve been ALIVE.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Jen interjected, shocked. ‚ÄúI have been with Agatha for ten years, and she has NEVER wanted anyone other than Wanda or Nicky on a red carpet more than once or twice. It‚Äôs because of all the pictures that are taken. She doesn‚Äôt want to look back and be filled with sadness repeatedly because of what she‚Äôs lost. She knows Wanda and Nicky are constants, and she‚Äôll always be filled with happiness and joy when she sees those pictures, no matter what.‚Äù Jen looked at her. ‚ÄúRio, that‚Äôs huge.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned against the wall, feeling as if all the air had been sucked from her lungs. Agatha knew that she would always associate good things with Rio. AFTER TWO MONTHS? What kind of witchcraft was happening? Agatha wanted her to be a constant in her life, and Rio so badly wanted that, too, which was what had brought forth this crisis.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHang on, then why were you all so insistent on FORCING her to take me to the premiere? Knowing it was such a big deal to her?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen waved her hand. ‚ÄúAgatha isn‚Äôt forced to do anything. If she didn‚Äôt want to take you, she wouldn‚Äôt, and again, more than once or twice. One premiere, okay. Wanting you to be her constant? Rio. She‚Äôs planning on you being beside her, in some capacity.‚Äù Jen internally screamed. Everyone had gotten on to her and Alice for taking so damn long to get it together, Wanda and Nat took a quarter of a fucking century, and now Rio and Agatha were alternating between going too fast and slamming on the brakes. Maybe she should have set up a fake dating ploy. Those situations seemed to move more quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded slowly. ‚ÄúSo she wants me in her life forever but isn‚Äôt sure about the capacity. Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt date parents.‚Äù Alice reminded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúEXACTLY! And why don‚Äôt I date parents? Because of the bitch back in San Francisco! I fell in love once, ONCE! Everything was going great, but then I found out she was NOT separated from her husband. That she was not going to get a divorce, and I broke it off, because OBVIOUSLY. She didn‚Äôt get the hint. Suddenly, she‚Äôs EVERYWHERE. Do you know how odd it is for a teacher to have to get a restraining order against a parent of a student?‚Äù She was power-walking all over Alice‚Äôs apartment at this point.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at Alice. ‚ÄúIs she just monologuing?‚Äù She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked back, ‚ÄúShe does this. I just go with it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio kept going like the Energizer bunny, not even hearing them, ‚ÄúLong story very short, Jen, I survived but ended up in the hospital with sustained injuries from the fucking husband! Swore off parents after that. Calderu knows, yet even SHE seems to want this. I also don‚Äôt trust that bitch not to show back up solely because she‚Äôs the jealous type, and I have to keep everyone safe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And then, THEN, there‚Äôs the NICKY of it all. I fucking love that kid! I‚Äôve known that damn kid for TWO MINUTES, and I would do anything for him. He‚Äôs so much like her, the mischievous little shit. If anyone had said it was his fault last night, I would‚Äôve caused some damage of my own. Do you know why he and Tommy wanted to take those girls out? Because the Bayside dickheads are misogynistic assholes, and our boys wanted to learn more to know what THEY could do to raise awareness about douchey behavior in high schools. Who does that sound like? His activist mother. That‚Äôs who. He is an amazing kid and I would be so proud to be a part of his life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I shared what he told me with Agatha and I‚Äôm sure she let Lilia know since Lilia listens to her for some unknown reason. The kid is 16 and has more empathy in his pinky than some grown-ass adults because the people that raised him, I know it wasn‚Äôt ALL Agatha, are just that fucking good. Another reason I can‚Äôt risk any of this is because this family that I have been accepted into is so amazing. Alice, it‚Äôs always just been you and me, and now, I have this whole family, and I can‚Äôt lose that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, we have an ENTIRE WEEKEND in New York, BY OURSELVES. I‚Äôm not canceling whatsoever. Of course, we‚Äôll be sharing a fucking bed because we can‚Äôt spend the night under the same roof and sleep separately. We‚Äôre so fucking gay for each other, but I can‚Äôt lose this, and I can‚Äôt lose her, and I can‚Äôt risk anything, but sleeping next to her is the most natural thing in the world. I didn‚Äôt even feel that way with the stalker chick. Sharing a bed with you, Alice is like sleeping next to my sister because you are. This? This is something entirely different, and I can‚Äôt put it into words yet. Anytime we spend the night in the same house, I want us to wake up in each other‚Äôs arms because I feel like that‚Äôs where we belong, and it scares the hell out of me.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Yet I can‚Äôt get over my OWN issues long enough to even tell her what MY fucking bullshit is, and I don‚Äôt want to hurt either of them. So here I am ranting to you two lovesick idiots, don‚Äôt deny it, while she probably is just enjoying her wine night with those other lesbians finally living their truth.‚Äù Her eyes were wild, cheeks flushed from the constant movement. She gulped down her water while she tried to slow her breathing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked at her calmly. ‚ÄúRio. As you said, it‚Äôs been two months. The San Francisco thing was bad, I know. I saw you in the hospital. I almost killed that bitch myself. It won‚Äôt happen again, and you need to tell Agatha everything. You both need to lay all your cards on the table and decide, like the adults you both claim you are, if it‚Äôs worth it. However, it has only been two months.‚Äù She knew Rio was worried, and her feelings were valid, but Rio was in deep and needed to talk to Agatha sooner rather than later. Alice wanted to see her truly happy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smiled at Rio, ‚ÄúI can tell you that you can tell Agatha anything, and it won‚Äôt change how she sees you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio huffed. ‚ÄúRight. Two months,‚Äù She chewed on the inside of her cheek as she thought about everything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give yourself an aneurysm,‚Äù Jen remarked, seeing the gears turning in Rio‚Äôs mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou have time to work everything out, Ri. Neither of you is going anywhere. Agatha is beginning to film, which means less time together and not as much texting. That‚Äôs a good thing. Keep it friendly in New York, have fun at the Halloween party, and then we‚Äôll make it through the holidays. After the first of the year, she‚Äôll be on location for filming, and the distance will be good for both of you.‚Äù Alice offered. ‚ÄúJust keep building on this.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚ÄúOkay. Yes. Less time together could be good,‚Äù She had started moving again, refilling her water.¬† ‚ÄúI need to suppress these feelings, ignore them, and they will eventually go away. Maybe I‚Äôll go on a few dates, maybe I‚Äôll read more, actually tend to my plants more, and pick up some other hobbies. YES. Will I ever lay my soul bare for her? Maybe. Right now, I‚Äôm going to go home to my cat.‚Äù With that, she walked out of the door. Alice buried her head in her hands as Jen looked at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy is she an idiot?‚Äù Jen asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked up at her. ‚ÄúI blame her parents. My mother had an influence too. Gran tried so hard with both of us. She really did.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen shook her head, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not going to suppress a damn thing, is she?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice stood and stretched, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll try, I give it until Halloween. I don‚Äôt see her going on a date.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smiled. ‚ÄúImagine. If she even mentioned it, they would mysteriously cancel. Wanda would make sure of it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Rio tried to settle herself for the night, she kept thinking about the monologue and conversation at Alice‚Äôs.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       If I‚Äôm ready to tell her about why I have my rule, then am I ready to hear why she has hers, and be rejected?
      </span>

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had woken up alone, a blanket tucked around her, and a text from Rio explaining she had to get home and would talk to her later. It was probably for the best since Nicky was home. He didn‚Äôt need to see them spooning on the couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was in the kitchen fixing her coffee and making pancakes when her son walked in, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Rio?‚Äù He asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was thankful for all the years of acting experience as she kept her face blank and put pancakes on a plate for him. ‚ÄúShe went home last night.‚Äù She handed him his plate and turned back to the stove to finish breakfast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was not stupid. ‚ÄúMom. She spends the night every Saturday when you guys have movie night. You cuddle. The twins and I know everything. We‚Äôre even in the betting pool.‚Äù He said with a smirk. He was her son. Agatha didn‚Äôt know why she underestimated him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She flipped the pancakes and turned to look at him, shock on her face. ‚ÄúExcuse me, young man?‚Äù His admission had taken her by surprise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
      <em>
       your
      </em>
      son and, therefore, the second smartest person in the room, Mom. Anyone with eyes can see you two are attracted to each other. Like I said last night. I like her.‚Äù He carefully watched her reaction to make sure he hadn‚Äôt overstepped.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She finished the pancakes, plated them, and turned off the stove. ‚ÄúYou have a field to clean up today,‚Äù She said, taking her own breakfast to the table as she thought about what he had said. ‚ÄúHave I told you what a great kid you are?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI had some pretty decent role models. By that, I mean Uncle Vision and Aunt Nat,‚Äù He grinned as she playfully smacked his arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSmartass.‚Äù She laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLearned from the best.‚Äù He smiled at her as he took a seat at the table. ‚ÄúI love you, Mom,‚Äù he gave her an honest look before nearly inhaling his breakfast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI love you too, kid,‚Äù She smiled back before laughing. ‚ÄúYou eat like Rio does.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He gave her a mischievous look before putting down his fork. ‚ÄúSee, already picking up habits from my future stepmother.‚Äù He bolted upstairs to get ready before she could process what he said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her jaw dropped before she just groaned. ‚ÄúAssholes. I‚Äôm surrounded by assholes.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By Sunday evening, while Rio was going on her diatribe, Agatha was going on one of her own. She was lesbian spreading on her couch while Wanda and Nat were being disgustingly cute on what was now their couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou two are disgusting,‚Äù Agatha said, rolling her eyes, drinking water of all things. She needed to be sober. She had told them about the conversation with Nicky this morning and Wanda had excitedly told her that had meant she could drop her rule. Agatha, however, was too hard-headed for that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPlease, we‚Äôve always been like this when it‚Äôs just the three of us,‚Äù Wanda responded. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just sensitive.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am not,‚Äù Agatha argued. ‚ÄúAnyway, back to me. Even if I did drop the no-teacher rule, I still don‚Äôt have relationships and can‚Äôt risk losing Rio. That‚Äôs what the whole thing boils down to. I have to tell her why I refuse to have a relationship, but what if it‚Äôs something she can‚Äôt handle? What if it changes the way she looks at me? I fell in love once, and it went badly. I refuse even to tell the two of you everything.‚Äù Agatha shook her head as if to shake the memories away. ‚ÄúI know I was much younger, and so much has changed since then. I know what it‚Äôs like to be the younger person in a relationship, and it‚Äôs hard. I think she could handle it a lot better than I did though.‚Äù She smiled sadly as she continued. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how she would handle the fame and pressure, though. It‚Äôs a lot, and it‚Äôs a big conversation to be had if we even got to that point. As for the teacher thing, as long as Nicky understood that this did not change anything and that he would not get any special treatment, then that could be changed. That‚Äôs a newer rule, anyway. It‚Äôs the no relationship rule that I‚Äôm more inclined to stick with.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda stared at her. ‚ÄúFor the smartest person I know, you‚Äôre an idiot. Nothing you say is going to change the way she feels about you. She also has Vision and Nat for support on dating a megastar. I know you still outshine me. You always will. Don‚Äôt look at me like that. In my eyes, you will always be THE Agatha Harkness, and I will ALWAYS be in your shadow. ALWAYS. Your last relationship was decades ago. I still don‚Äôt even know who it was, and only Nat and I even know you had a relationship. Rio will want to be public with you. You just have to talk to her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded, placing a kiss on Wanda‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúRed‚Äôs right. We tease, and we push, but Agatha, in the 27 years I‚Äôve known you, not once have I seen you look at someone the way I‚Äôve seen you look at Rio Vidal. It‚Äôs been a little over two months, and if I didn‚Äôt know the circumstances, I would think you two had been together for years.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda turned and kissed Nat on the cheek before turning back to Agatha. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to stop meddling either because Rio looks at you like you‚Äôre the only person in the room. Yes, it‚Äôs only been two months, yet you‚Äôve even said yourself that it feels incredibly natural and like you‚Äôve known each other for years. So why does actual time matter? I don‚Äôt think the age gap even matters to you anymore, even if it scared you at first and now I know why. This is Hollywood! Age gaps are everywhere! Sixteen years is NOTHING here. Sarah is a dear friend of yours, and Holland is thirty-four years older than she is. That‚Äôs almost as long as Rio has been alive, and that‚Äôs not even the largest. Get over yourself, Harkness.‚Äù Wanda loved Agatha and wanted what was best for her. If she needed to be both the voice of reason and the person pushing her off the cliff, she would be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was processing everything. It was a lot to take in. ‚ÄúFilming is about to pick up a lot, and I‚Äôll be in New York for SNL rehearsals, then back here for the premiere, then back in New York for our weekend together where I am set on nothing happening.‚Äù She ignored the clearly disappointed looks on her friends' faces. ‚ÄúBack here for more filming, and then Halloween.‚Äù She looked down at her lap, knowing she needed to tell Wanda what she had asked Rio. ‚ÄúI asked Rio to be my companion for premieres and award shows‚Ä¶‚Äù She barely got it out before Wanda sat up and squealed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you lead with that?‚Äù Wanda asked with excitement in her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want you to get too excited. I know you‚Äôll want to start going with Nat, and Nicky is getting too old to join Mom.‚Äù She waved it off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, whatever. Justify it all you want but Agatha Harkness does not ask someone to be her recurring date for major events if she doesn‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be a permanent fixture in her life. You want to slow down, yet you‚Äôre speeding up, too. You‚Äôre an idiot.‚Äù Wanda shook her head as she reassumed her position against Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLook who‚Äôs talking.‚Äù Agatha shot back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGo to hell,‚Äù Wanda replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs already in one of her own making,‚Äù Nat said knowingly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just grimaced. If anyone knew how she was feeling, it was those two. She couldn‚Äôt help but think to herself that maybe she was ready for something more with Rio.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       You absolutely can‚Äôt stand to be away from her, and when you are with her you can‚Äôt help but touch her. You imagine kissing her or other things.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Now, how could she get her to open up about Rio‚Äôs no-parents‚Äô rule?
     </span>
</p>
<p>

      Midterm week went by both slowly and too quickly. Rio was looking forward to the next week‚Äôs events, however, she had a lot to wrap up and a very short amount of time. She somehow managed to complete everything by the final bell on Friday, and thankfully, there were no football games for the next two weeks. Her exhaustion was apparent as she just dropped her bag by the entryway as she walked into her apartment. The first nine weeks had been completed, and she was thankful for the week off. She barely got to the couch before collapsing, kicking her shoes off, when her phone dinged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Agatha üíú

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Hey, filming for the day will run
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      later than I thought. Want to
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      grab a late dinner?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio read the message and thought about it. They hadn‚Äôt seen each other all week, and she missed Agatha. She was also tired and knew if Agatha came over, she would fall asleep on her, Agatha would stay, and they would end up spending most of the weekend together. The following weekend would be New York weekend, and Rio was supposed to be backing off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Me:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I am exhausted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Probably will turn in
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      early. Sorry!
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She refused to focus on the pain in her chest when she hit send. Of course, she wanted to grab a late dinner. She wanted to order something, have Agatha come over, and then go to bed together. Instead, she ignored Agatha‚Äôs reply, put her phone down, and let the exhaustion overtake her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha responded with a quick ‚Äúokay.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt expect a reply. Agatha wanted this after all, she had wanted to back off, right? This would be fine. They would have movie night this weekend, and everything would be back to normal. The premiere was Wednesday, and New York was next weekend. Everything would be fine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could have murdered their friends. All six of them were gathered for movie night, and Wanda had shirts made for the four meddling bitches. They all said Team Get Together All Ready, causing Rio and Agatha to blush. Wanda thought it was hilarious and Rio had rolled her eyes while blushing. While Wanda had said she would continue meddling, Agatha preferred when it was more subtle. She had already made a concerted effort to sit in a way where Rio would not cuddle up next to her, and it felt like Wanda was rubbing salt in the wound. It felt wrong not to have Rio right next to her. This was going to be painful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had taken that opportunity to address the upcoming premiere on Wednesday. Agatha would spend much of the week in New York, and Jen wanted to take advantage of everyone in one place.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay, we know the media will jump on why you didn‚Äôt go with each other since you're co-starring, and historically, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôve done before anytime you‚Äôve done projects together or been nominated together. So what do you want your statements to be?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was still taking Vision, as nothing on that front would change until after the holidays. ‚ÄúWhile Agatha and I are co-stars, Vision has been another constant support in my life, and with the importance of this movie, it felt right for him to be here.‚Äù She stated, staring at Nat the entire time. Nat would be there in the wings like she always was. Wanda was hopeful that Nat would be her date at the Golden Globes. She would let Jen handle the PR shit show.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen wrote it down, knowing it would be picked apart in a few months. She looked at the two women, desperately trying to distance themselves from each other. ‚ÄúAgatha?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha thought about it, knowing no matter what she said, it would be spun however the media or fans wanted to spin it. No comment would almost be worse. ‚ÄúRio is a close friend of mine, and her support means a lot to me.‚Äù She said as she made eye contact with Rio. It was a simple statement that held a lot of weight to it. Rio nodded her agreement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked around before landing on Alice. ‚ÄúSomeone is going to see you and know who you are.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shrugged. ‚ÄúFuck ‚Äòem. I‚Äôll stay as hidden as I can and handle it if I need to.‚Äù Alice generally didn‚Äôt attend anything but wanted to start supporting her friends, especially with Rio entering this world now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked back at the two movie stars. ‚ÄúYou know there‚Äôs going to be a lot of questions, and Nat will step in if she needs to. I know you can handle it, but this is very out of character for you both.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt will be fine,‚Äù Agatha reassured her before looking over at Rio, who was looking at Agatha intently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have you next to me. I can handle anything,‚Äù Rio said, forgetting the four other women in the room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúJUST KISS ALREADY!‚Äù Jen cried, breaking the tension, as Agatha glared at her and Rio stared at the floor uncomfortably.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen regained her composure, ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre good,‚Äù she said, normally, putting away her notebook and nodding at Alice to start the move, trying to suppress her laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned back to Rio, speaking quietly. ‚ÄúWhat did that mean?‚Äù She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just shrugged, trying to play it off. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Agatha Fucking Harkness. Who is going to come after me when you‚Äôre by my side..‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTrue‚Ä¶.‚Äù Agatha gave her a small smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned her attention to the movie. Here she was trying to distance herself, and yet she was running straight towards Agatha again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the movie went on, every shared whisper and comment brought the two women closer together, inch by inch. Soon, Agatha found that they were just about in their familiar cuddling position.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Well, that lasted.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She thought but sighed, relieved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had flown back from New York Wednesday morning. Now, here she was with her and Wanda‚Äôs team prepping them and Rio, for the night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy am I nervous? We‚Äôve done this most of our lives.‚Äù Agatha asked Wanda as she checked her final look in the full-length mirror in her bathroom. She wore a fitted black suit with a lace bra underneath instead of a shirt. Her hair was parted to the side in loose waves, signature locket on a chain around her neck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBecause there‚Äôs so much pressure on this movie to be amazing, and the woman you refuse to date is getting ready across the hall,‚Äù Wanda replied. Her auburn hair was done in an updo to show off ruby drop earrings. Her black sequin halter dress had a deep v-neck just below her sternum and came to her knee before opening in a split and showing off her red-bottom black heels. If anyone asked her though, her favorite part was that it had pockets.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just shook her head. ‚ÄúI am not
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       refusing
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      to date her. It hasn‚Äôt even come up. We‚Äôve agreed just to be friends.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda clicked her tongue. ‚ÄúHow long are you going to lie to yourself?‚Äù She asked sincerely.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn‚Äôt answer, she looked herself over one more time in the mirror before walking out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was waiting downstairs with Vision and the other three women. Vision appeared every inch the doting, supportive husband in a dapper black suit. He was in conversation with Nat, who looked every part the bodyguard in her suit. Rio admired them both for how much they had done for Wanda and how they had stood by her all this time. Jen wore a pink and black ombre suit and Alice had chosen a simple black dress, hoping to blend into the background. Rio however, couldn‚Äôt blend in if she tried. Jen, Agatha‚Äôs stylist, with help from Wanda, Rio presumed, had worked together to choose her outfit. It was a strapless cream dress that came to her mid-thigh with a black lace floor-length overlay. Her hair was half up, half down, and for some reason, she was eager to see Agatha‚Äôs reaction to the look. Rio also couldn‚Äôt wait to see Agatha‚Äôs, for that matter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThere are the stars of the evening.‚Äù Vision announced as Wanda and Agatha entered the room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned around and forgot how to breathe. Agatha a natural beauty, looked even more stunning than usual. As she approached Rio, Rio regained her ability to function like a normal human.¬† Agatha smiled, tucking her hair behind her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou look amazing.‚Äù They said simultaneously and laughed nervously, quietly routinely admiring each other‚Äôs outfits.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like teenagers on prom night,‚Äù Wanda said to the others with a smirk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pretended not to hear her, nor did she really care. Before her, Rio was gorgeous, and for once, she, Agatha Fucking Harkness, was nearly speechless. ‚ÄúYou, just, wow.‚Äù Agatha breathed, blushing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had also turned red, ‚ÄúYou too.‚Äù She replied, before adding. ‚ÄúAs a friend, of course.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Agatha said, feeling like she had just taken a punch to the gut.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLiars,‚Äù Wanda said to them as she walked past, leading everyone to the two SUV‚Äôs that were waiting for them outside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWill one of you keep her in line?‚Äù Agatha asked, speaking to Nat and Vision.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision laughed. ‚ÄúNeither of us is capable of that, and you know it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they arrived at the theatre where the premiere was, Rio was nervous. She knew there would be questions, cameras, and lights. It was all overwhelming. She felt Agatha‚Äôs hand on her thigh, and she stopped shaking her leg. She hadn‚Äôt even noticed she was doing it until she felt Agatha‚Äôs hand, and the accompanying jolt of electricity from the touch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Agatha said quietly, getting her attention. ‚ÄúIf you get nervous, just look at me, okay?‚Äù She gave Rio that genuine smile that was reserved for just a few people, as her blue eyes looked deeply into Rio‚Äôs. ‚ÄúEverything will be fine. It‚Äôs a few minutes outside, and there are a few interviews that I‚Äôll handle. Then we go inside and watch the movie. Afterward, more pictures, a few more interviews, and back to my house so you can go home. Sound like a plan?‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs voice was calming, her eyes were soft, and in that moment, Rio would have followed her anywhere with the way she was speaking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yeah, I can do this. Don't walk too far off and abandon me to the wolves, Harkness."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Never," Agatha replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen cleared her throat. ‚ÄúI hate to break up whatever that moment is, but it‚Äôs time to exit the vehicle.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha broke the eye contact as she scooted to the door. ‚ÄúRight, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Other movie stars were already there, posing for pictures and speaking with the media. Wanda and Agatha, as the two movie leads, were at the very end of the line. Wanda and Vision went first, though the four posed together, and Agatha and Wanda took several pictures with castmates. Nat and three other bodyguards walked with them, followed by Jen. Alice had gone to blend with the crowd.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Cameras were flashing, and questions were being asked from all directions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you come as each other's date like you have in the past?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, who‚Äôs your date?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúVision, what do you think about UCLA‚Äôs current odds of making a bowl game?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, is this your girlfriend or just your current
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       girl
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, why haven‚Äôt you been seen out lately?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWanda, why haven‚Äôt we seen you and Vision together lately?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While they had been making the press circuit, neither star had been seen in public recently, other than school functions, and rumors had been flying. They gave their rehearsed answers and statements and spoke about the movie, before moving into the theatre. As they sat, Rio‚Äôs eyes went wide as she turned to Agatha. ‚ÄúIs it always like that?‚Äù She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed. ‚ÄúNot always, but I had someone new with me. So, new questions. Now, watch the movie and enjoy seeing me naked.‚Äù She winked as Rio blushed. She completely forgot about those scenes. Yes, she had seen Agatha in sex scenes before, but this was different. Completely different.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda leaned over to Rio. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt kill me. While we do kiss, and I am touching her, I‚Äôm not actually having sex with your woman.‚Äù She whispered conspiratoriously and flashed Rio a shit-eating grin before sitting back in her seat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just groaned. This was going to be a long movie.

<p>
     Rio was captivated by what was unfolding on the screen before her. There was such amazing chemistry between Agatha and Wanda, even she believed they were passionately in love. The beautiful love scene at the end of the movie was the perfect end to this dramatic psychological thriller. Agatha played an FBI agent, married to Wanda, when they began tracking a major serial killer that consumed Agatha‚Äôs character. Wanda‚Äôs character struggled with nearly losing her wife so many times and trying to be supportive. The emotional roller coaster ending in this physical and naked scene was almost too much for Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had seen Agatha naked in movies plenty of times. However, that was before they were close friends or sitting right next to her. She certainly had never felt awkward during any of Agatha‚Äôs intimate scenes, but now? She knew it was fake, yet here she was, not just feeling a little awkward, but bubbling jealousy over Wanda? It was Wanda Maximoff of all people. Wanda, who was madly in love with Nat. Oh yes, calm and collected, Nat. Nat who had years of experience watching these scenes, of watching Wanda film these scenes over and over, and never being able to react publically. Rio couldn‚Äôt imagine. She would have incurred assault charges at this point. Where were these thoughts and feelings coming from? She had zero claim to Agatha and no right to be jealous. Agatha could do whatever she wanted with whoever she wanted, couldn‚Äôt she?
     <em>
      You want her to be yours
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she just watched the scene before her. Rio‚Äôs mind began to wander as she pictured herself with Agatha instead of Wanda. It wasn‚Äôt the first time since they became friends that she fantasized about Agatha, putting her various toys to good use. But, this was different. She hadn‚Äôt had the imagery and audio to go with it. As the movie played, so did the one in her imagination, which was much better, if you asked her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Rio pressed their mouths together in a needy kiss. Her wife had almost died, and she needed to show her just how much she loved and needed her. Maybe Agatha would stop this futile pursuit before it actually did kill her. She backed her into the wall, deepening the kiss as she slid her tongue across Agatha‚Äôs bottom lip before biting it, eliciting a gasp. Rio had one arm around Agatha‚Äôs waist and the other hand twisted in her hair. Agatha held Rio securely against her, hands fisted in the back of Rio‚Äôs sweater.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Rio slid her tongue against Agatha‚Äôs, exploring her mouth, as she spun her and moved her to the bed, clothes shedding as they went.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She lowered Agatha to the bed. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt lose you,‚Äù Rio whispered, echoing the line from the actresses and breaking the kiss.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Rio leaned in and kissed Agatha again before trailing kisses down her neck and to her chest, taking Agatha‚Äôs right breast in her hand and running her thumb over her hardened nipple. Rio‚Äôs imagination now diverging from the movie and in control of the fantasy.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She wrapped her lips around the other nipple and sucked, mimicking the rolling and pulling that she was doing with her fingers. She was rewarded with several gasps and moans. Agatha grabbed her chin and yanked, pulling her up to kiss her again and take control.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha rolled over on top of her, their bodies pressed together everywhere. Rio tried not to shiver visibly, as her body manifested the fantasy. Agatha still had a hold on her jaw and gripped it as she kissed her like she needed all of the oxygen from Rio‚Äôs lungs to survive.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      God, why was this also making her cry? Agatha Harkness was on a giant screen, naked, she was fantasizing about her, and she was still captivated by her acting. The build-up was fantastic.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha kissed her again, slower, more deliberately this time, like she was trying to map the layout of her mouth, and Rio responded the same way, tracing Agatha‚Äôs tongue, the shape of her lips, the roof of her mouth, everything. Her hands explored Agatha‚Äôs back, arms, neck, fingers tracing every muscle.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Her fingers twitched, bringing her back to the moment. She itched to reach out to the woman next to her.
     <em>
      Keep it in your head, Vidal.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha‚Äôs hands were on the move, she was straddling Rio, one hand next to Rio‚Äôs head for support and the other running down the length of her body, sending sparks of electricity everywhere she touched her skin. She finally reached where Rio wanted her most and shifted to spread Rio‚Äôs legs further apart.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The camera was more focused on faces and glimpses of skin, it was all very tasteful, but Rio could take it from here.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha dragged her nails up Rio‚Äôs thigh as she gasped from the sensation, gripping Agatha‚Äôs shoulders and kissing her harder. Agatha smiled into the kiss before lightly ghosting her fingers over Rio‚Äôs core and feeling how wet she was. Rio was filled with heat and want. She needed Agatha to touch her, to make her come. Agatha lightly brushed over Rio‚Äôs clit, causing her to whimper. Agatha kissed down Rio‚Äôs jaw and down her neck, before licking her pulse point and focusing there. She pressed down on Rio‚Äôs hardened clit before making circles around it, causing her hips to buck. As Rio got closer, Agatha stopped, only to push two fingers into Rio‚Äôs entrance as she bit down on her neck. Rio cried out as she dug her nails into Agatha‚Äôs back and her hips came up to meet Agatha‚Äôs thrusts. Agatha pumped in and out, Rio was so close. She slung a leg around Agatha‚Äôs waist to allow her to hit a different angle. Agatha pressed her thumb back on Rio‚Äôs clit at the same time as she curled her fingers forward and she came hard with a scream.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio broke from her thoughts when she heard Agatha‚Äôs moans in real life. Rio had gotten so caught up in her thoughts that she had missed Agatha‚Äôs climax scene.
    </p>
<p>
     She squeezed her eyes shut, breathing deeply, and trying to clear her mind and make the heat between her legs go away when Agatha put her hand on hers, leaning over.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you to a G-rated movie next time,‚Äù She whispered playfully.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      If you only knew,
     </em>
     she thought, as the touch from Agatha sent sparks all over her body and made the flame in her core grow brighter.
     <em>
      Great
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     Rio focused back in on the movie, the sex scene finally over. Agatha‚Äôs character came face to face with Agatha‚Äôs wife revealed as the killer. The scene had brought Rio to tears. The heartfelt words, the admissions, Agatha knowing it was Wanda but not wanting to admit it to herself. The FBI closed in as Agatha had to decide between letting Wanda‚Äôs character go or capturing her as they stood on a pier. Gunshots rang. Wanda had shot Agatha, and Agatha had shot her back. Agatha woke up in the hospital to be told that Wanda‚Äôs body hadn‚Äôt been found, but by the amount of blood, she had to be dead.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio realized she was holding Agatha‚Äôs hand. Agatha had never moved it from earlier, and now their fingers were intertwined, still in Rio‚Äôs lap, dangerously close to where she needed it after the earlier fantasy. She let it be for the last few minutes of the movie. No sense in moving it now.
    </p>
<p>
     In the final scene, Agatha returns to the place where their characters first met, only to find Wanda there. They kiss. The title song, sung by Agatha, plays, and the credits roll.
    </p>
<p>
     A psychological thriller about Agatha hunting Wanda, her fucking serial killer wife, had Rio both in tears and ready to throw caution to the wind.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let go of Agatha‚Äôs hand abruptly and immediately missed the connection. She stood and hugged her as the theater erupted in applause. As she stepped back, she looked at Agatha in awe.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou are amazing,‚Äù Rio said, regarding her in all of her award-winning megastar glory.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had received the highest praise from some of Hollywood‚Äôs most legendary icons. Yet it all paled in comparison to the look in Rio‚Äôs eyes right now. The sheer appreciation and admiration she saw. All she could do was smile back, anything else, and she might cry, or kiss her. Agatha had no idea why three simple words, a hug, and a look from one woman meant everything to her, but they did. If she never received another award, another positive word from the media or a movie critic, it wouldn‚Äôt matter. As long as Rio thought she was amazing, that‚Äôs all she needed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou two will absolutely get nominated!‚Äù Alice‚Äôs voice broke through the moment as she scooted down the row they were in to hug Agatha and Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda laughed. ‚ÄúFor best kiss at the MTV Movie Awards, at least.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt be the first time.‚Äù Agatha agreed.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     After more interviews and mingling, they finally climbed back into their vehicles to return to the compound.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat was fun and exhausting at the same time.‚Äù Rio sighed, leaning against Agatha. She was tired and thrilled she had nowhere to be the next day.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt usually is,‚Äù Agatha agreed as she instinctively put her arm around Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice looked over at Jen, raising an eyebrow and cutting her eyes to the two women. Jen silently took a picture and sent it to Wanda in the other car.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda checked her texts and almost screamed, solely from how Agatha looked at Rio. Nat just shook her head. ‚ÄúThese lesbians are going to be the death of you.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Vision smiled. ‚ÄúFunny, I‚Äôve said that for twenty years.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Nat and Wanda nearly choked.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had changed out of her dress and ridden back home with Alice, thankful for the decision to ride together. She was exhausted and knew she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to drive herself. She kept thinking about her feelings as she watched the movie. If she were to ever actually date Agatha, would she be able to get over the nudity in movies? Agatha kissing other people?
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAlice, am I a jealous person?‚Äù She asked honestly.
    </p>
<p>
     The laughter from Alice lasted a bit too long.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Alice calmed the laughter. ‚ÄúFeeling jealous?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blushed in stubborn silence.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAre you JEALOUS that other people see Agatha naked? Or are you jealous of Wanda?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúA bit of both?‚Äù Rio spilled her thoughts, which had bothered her for hours.¬† ‚ÄúIn the last relationship I was in, she was a model, and I wasn‚Äôt jealous. I wasn‚Äôt jealous when I found out she was still married, either. I was never jealous of people who had better lives or were famous or prettier. Yet, other people looking at Agatha? I know that‚Äôs not the first time she‚Äôs had a nude or sexual scene, and it‚Äôs not the last‚Ä¶And Wanda kissing and TOUCHING Agatha? I have zero claim to her, so why did I feel like this?‚Äù She asked Alice earnestly.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice pulled into her parking spot and turned off the car before regarding Rio. ‚ÄúYou know the answer just as well as I do, but you continue to lie to yourself. I know you‚Äôre afraid, and rightly so. That bitch back in San Francisco screwed you up. But, If you ever do decide to date Agatha though, you‚Äôre going to have to deal with these feelings and more movies and scenes like what you witnessed tonight. You have to ask yourself if you can handle it, and if it‚Äôs worth it.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     With that, Alice got out of the vehicle, and Rio followed. They went up to their apartments quietly, Rio lost in her thoughts. Could she handle more of this? She honestly wasn‚Äôt sure. She had been so caught up in her rule, that she hadn‚Äôt thought of what dating THE Agatha Fucking Harkness would entail.
    </p>
<p>
     She hugged Alice before entering her apartment and being greeted by one pissed-off Raven.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRight, I was gone all day, and for some reason, you require food,‚Äù She said as she walked to the kitchen. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know how to do this yourself by now?‚Äù She looked at Raven, who waited rather impatiently. ‚ÄúYou know, you‚Äôre lucky. You have me and whoever I bring home. You don‚Äôt have to worry about the complexity of relationships or work. You don‚Äôt have to worry about getting jealous about your close friend, who you might be extremely attracted to, having fake sex with your other close friend, who also happens to be gay, but not gay for your crush.‚Äù She set Raven‚Äôs food down and cleaned up a few things around the kitchen, watering plants before bed. ‚ÄúYou also don‚Äôt have to worry about what would happen if you ever DID date her. How would you handle dating said friend?‚Äù She finished her chores, turned off lights, and took care of a few things as she walked towards her room. Raven trailed behind her. ‚ÄúDo I want people to know who I am? Just being on Agatha‚Äôs arm tonight was anxiety-inducing. I‚Äôm afraid to look at my phone right now. Who knows what pictures have been posted and what‚Äôs been said?‚Äù She changed into her pajamas as Raven curled up on her side of the bed. ‚ÄúNot to mention, what would you do? You would lose your side of the bed.‚Äù Raven looked at Rio and meowed at that. Raven did not share well and whenever someone was in bed with Rio, Raven took personal offense.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just sighed. ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself. It will never happen, only in my dreams and fantasies.‚Äù She climbed into bed, finally looking at her phone, which was full of notifications. ‚ÄúSee, Raven. I told you, might as well take a look.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She tapped on some of the stories to see the pictures and headlines.
    </p>
<p>
<em>

<em>

     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The first several headlines were movie-focused and she was relieved. Then she saw the tweets, skeets, and pictures that focused on the two leading ladies themselves.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúBreaking tradition, the two leading ladies co-starred but brought separate dates instead of going together.‚Äù
    </p>

    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The comments continued, and some of them were just downright mean, especially about Rio being there with Agatha. Her reading was interrupted.

     It was a lie, but she wouldn‚Äôt tell Rio that she monitored what was said, mainly to have certain things scrubbed.

     Rio just grinned at the Mother comment. She knew it had multiple meanings, and she meant it in a few ways. She sighed as she set her music up, saved some of the pictures she had seen posted, and settled in. Some of the comments stuck with her though.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat woman is definitely not with Agatha. Agatha is out of her league.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     That was true. Rio wasn‚Äôt even in the same stratosphere as Agatha. As it was, she had zero idea what to pack this weekend. She had never considered what to wear around Agatha in the real world. Rio was always herself, but now she was very aware that she would be in public around her. Very public.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAgatha doesn‚Äôt do relationships. Whoever she is, she isn‚Äôt permanent.‚Äù Another comment, another trueism. Agatha didn‚Äôt do permanent. How long would Rio be around if they did date? It was better to remain friends.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Yet, there was another post that really stuck with her. It was a picture of them looking at each other. Rio remembered the moment: Agatha had answered something, and their eyes caught one another‚Äôs, and they both just softened. Rio had saved the picture because of the way they were looking at each other, and someone else had noticed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a fan of Agatha Harkness since she was a kid,‚Äù the post said ‚Äúand I‚Äôve never seen her look at anyone like that.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     It actually scared Rio a bit, but she saved it too. She couldn‚Äôt quite put her finger on it, but something was there. They looked at each other as if no one else in the world mattered. It was as if, at that moment, time had stopped, and a declaration was being made that had knocked the wind from both of them. Rio had to think. What question had Agatha been asked? Something about the theme, maybe? The meaning? What her character was thinking? Then Rio remembered.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, your character is faced with this decision. What was going through her, and your, head to really show the love she had for her wife?‚Äù
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha smiled. ‚ÄúWithout giving too much away, these two have this history and are just so good for each other.‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs eyes met Rio‚Äôs, as if speaking directly to her.¬† So, no matter what happens or what deep dark secrets they harbor, my character, Ann, knows that her wife will always be the person she wants. That there is nothing that will stand in the way of that.‚Äù
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio let out a breath she hadn‚Äôt known she was holding. Okay, so that was certainly a declaration. Was Agatha actually speaking to her, though? They hadn‚Äôt known each other when she had filmed that scene, so surely it was just a coincidence. Rio needed to go to sleep. She was reading too far into things. She was not Megastar girlfriend material. She was best friend material.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Rio woke up to Wanda Maximoff throwing clothes on her bed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs past noon, and we have to get you packed. Wake up, sleepyhead.‚Äù She said as she found Rio‚Äôs half-packed suitcase.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled over, pulling the blankets over her head. She was having extremely pleasant dreams about a certain blue-eyed actress. ‚ÄúHow the hell did you get in here?‚Äù she grumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSorry, Ri. I let her in.‚Äù Alice apologized from the other room. ‚ÄúI also fed Raven. She was starving.‚Äù She added.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt believe her lies. She woke me up at five and made me feed her.‚Äù Rio got out of bed, made it, and got dressed in her bathroom. ‚ÄúWhat is all this anyway?‚Äù She called as she pulled her shirt over her head.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou leave for New York tomorrow, well, tonight really, and Jen sent me to make sure you are dressed appropriately,‚Äù Wanda called back as she rifled through Rio‚Äôs suitcase. Alice just watched with amusement.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI know how to pack for colder weather, Wanda,‚Äù Rio emerged from the bathroom in yoga pants and a t-shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo, I mean that,‚Äù She waved her hand at Rio‚Äôs current outfit. ‚ÄúThe two of you will be alone, but in public a lot. Security will be around but at a distance. Wear something else when you‚Äôre around her. Plus, you‚Äôll be going out Friday night, so bring something other than jeans and a T-shirt, Rio! You are gorgeous! Show it off! You can wear a coat when you‚Äôre outside.‚Äù Wanda was smiling, wickedly.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the clothes are for? To make sure I‚Äôm wearing coven-approved clothing that puts a spin on things?‚Äù Rio asked skeptically.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda nodded after removing most things from Rio‚Äôs suitcase. At least her lacy, coordinating underwear had made the cut. Rio had that going for her. ‚ÄúWhy couldn‚Äôt we just go shopping?‚Äù Rio looked at the large stack of clothing and several shopping bags.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda shook her head, ‚ÄúNo time, I sent Alice and Jen to do it.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a weekend, Wanda, not a month. This is entirely too much,‚Äù Rio was getting overwhelmed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI agree,‚Äù Wanda had started holding clothes up to Rio, Alice trying hard not to laugh from her spot on the bed. ‚ÄúIf I had my way, you‚Äôd spend the majority of the weekend wearing mostly nothing, but both of you are idiots and won‚Äôt make a move.‚Äù She sighed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThank you for your concern about my love and sex life,‚Äù Rio grabbed a short red dress from Wanda, if you could call it that, and went to try it on.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe just want the best for both of you,‚Äù Alice called out behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda nodded as they waited for Rio to come out. ‚ÄúYou treat her like a regular person, and that is so important. You went from starstruck to ‚Äòthis is just Agatha‚Äô in record time. You could handle the fame. You meet her at her most sarcastic. Alice and I are so protective of the two of you, and we agree that we would allow this.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI still get starstruck,‚Äù Rio replied.¬† Last night was the first time I truly saw her in her element. Thanks for the blessing to date your daughter there Mr. Harkness.‚Äù She smirked as she came out of the bathroom. Wanda and Alice just stared.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel herself blushing. ‚ÄúWhat? Does it look bad?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     The dress was bold. It was short. It was revealing. And Rio was proud of herself for getting into it without help. It was classic apple red, one strap holding it up on her right shoulder that went diagonally across her chest. While the dress completely covered her left side, on the right side, her breast was covered, but there was a cutout that went up to the bottom of her sternum, showing off most of her ribcage. Much of her back was exposed, except where the fabric from the right went around as if it was a strapless bra and connected to the left, where the shoulder strap also came down, diagonally, and connected. It was mid-thigh length, hugged every curve just right, and showed off every muscle. Rio liked to stay in shape, and in this dress, it showed.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda shook her head vigorously.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHoly shit. You‚Äôre fucking hot, Rio. Wear that Friday night. You might have a hard time dancing, nope, that‚Äôs perfect for dancing.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Alice nodded. ‚ÄúAgatha will love it.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hadn‚Äôt even really looked at herself. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre both exaggerating,‚Äù She went back to the bathroom to look at herself. ‚ÄúFuck. I‚Äôd fuck me in a heartbeat.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda threw herself back on the bed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the point!!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was suddenly more excited than she had been before.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had finished her packing, knowing they would be seen around the city. They had spent most of their friendship in private places or school functions, and now they would be in public spaces. Pictures were bound to be taken, there would be speculation, and Jen would be working her ass off from LA. Jen was the Tree to her Taylor, and Agatha would forever be in her debt.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Her suitcase was ready by the door since they were leaving the house around one a.m. and would meet the private jet on the tarmac. It was roughly a six-and-a-half-hour flight to New York and a three-hour time difference. They would get there by early afternoon, she would run through a few things at the studio, and they would go to dinner and then out. Wanda had gone through Agatha‚Äôs suitcase and approved what she had packed, as well as added a few things. She replaced some old pajamas with much shorter ones, though. Agatha allowed it. She had older ones in the Manhattan apartment. She‚Äôd wear them and send Wanda a picture.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had seen the comments and pictures posted online, and Jen had already posted statements and scrubbed a few unsavory things for both of the starlets. Things that speculated about Wanda and Vision, information that had leaked about Rio, the standard fare. She would never trade this life, but there were parts of it that she could do without. For one, the hateful articles about the movie were a part she hated. She loved some of the comments from her fans, though.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt is 2024, another year of our Lord and Savior Agatha Harkness, and there is STILL homophobia? HOW?!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThe entire country rallied around this woman in 1989. She propelled the entire community, yet there are still pockets of these people? It‚Äôs been 35 years!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThis just in: the movie is amazing, and no one cares about your hate.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThe true tragedy is how she‚Äôs clearly in love with that woman. Is Agatha about to be off the market for good? I mean, My chances weren‚Äôt AMAZING, but now they‚Äôre zero.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did a double take. She was absolutely NOT in love. At all. Strong like, maybe. Definitely lust. So much lust. She loved Rio like a friend, but she was not
     <em>
      in
     </em>
     love with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She clicked on her hashtag to read more comments, just for fun.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat poor woman doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIS WAGATHA OVER? I AM A CHILD OF DIVORCE!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHOW DO YOU GET AN INVITE FROM AGATHA?!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúCould you imagine having to handle all of the fame that goes with just DATING Agatha?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRIP WAGATHA!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSo, Mother broke up with Wanda and went and found a child to date?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúImagine going to a movie premiere with Agatha and then watching her have sex with Wanda Maximoff.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI know her, she‚Äôs a teacher!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNot Agatha being hot for teacher.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúLORNA WU‚ÄôS DAUGHTER IS THERE!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha would have to make sure Jen kept an eye out for information about Rio leaking. She would also need to talk to Rio and ask her what she wanted Agatha to post on her official social media pages.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked up from her phone as Wanda walked in. They had apps on their phones to disarm the alarm systems, as well as keys, to each other‚Äôs houses. Jen and Alice also had that power, and recently, she‚Äôd given Rio that access. She trusted her. It‚Äôs what friends did.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIs Rio coming here tonight, or are you picking her up?‚Äù Wanda asked as she went straight to the kitchen to refill her water cup.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúPicking her up.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúChange it. Have her come here. It‚Äôll be easier.‚Äù Wanda walked into the living room and flopped down next to Wanda, traces of cat hair on her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed, noticing the feline evidence, ‚ÄúYou just packed for her and want to make sure she doesn‚Äôt unpack everything,‚Äù she stated with a knowing look.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDamn that amazing cat and her hair.‚Äù Wanda looked down at herself, knowing she‚Äôd been caught red-handed because of Raven.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI would rather have her over anyway,‚Äù Agatha muttered, seeing Wanda‚Äôs sly grin. ‚ÄúWhatever, where‚Äôs your wife?‚Äù Agatha continued.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shot Rio a text asking her if she wanted to come over, eat dinner, and leave from there instead. Rio replied instantly with yes and that she‚Äôd be there at seven. It was currently five-thirty.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe are not married. We‚Äôre not even technically dating,‚Äù Wanda rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThe boys wanted to go to some college sports thing this afternoon with Vision, and she went with them as extra security. Did you not know? Your OWN SON went.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI knew he was going. I just didn‚Äôt know Nat was going with them instead of spending the time with you. She usually spends all possible moments with you. Trouble in paradise?‚Äù Agatha asked, looking at Wanda seriously.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda just smiled. ‚ÄúNo. Truthfully? I asked her to go. After seeing some‚Ä¶comments, online today, she needed to be seen protecting someone that wasn‚Äôt me.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a warm look. ‚ÄúOh honey, I‚Äôm sorry you saw those. I‚Äôm trying to get all the nastiness taken down,‚Äù Wanda nodded as tears started to form. Agatha held her arms open, and Wanda buried them into her like she had done hundreds of times over the years. Agatha soothed her, smoothing her hair down, ever the protective big sister. ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs just speculation right now. Almost all of the comments were positive. We still have so much time to prepare for everything, okay? We‚Äôre able to get ahead, and we‚Äôre going to tackle it all head-on. All of us, okay? This family that you and I built, starting with you seducing Nat out of killing us, we‚Äôre going to do everything we can, and we‚Äôll protect each other.‚Äù She kissed Wanda on top of her head in comfort.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda shifted so her head was leaning on Agatha‚Äôs shoulder, legs over her lap, arms wrapped around her waist. Agatha had her feet propped on the table in front of them, and both arms around Wanda‚Äôs shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI know we will. I‚Äôm just worried about the boys and what people will say at school, or what if Nat decides she doesn‚Äôt want this?‚Äù Wanda‚Äôs lip quivered as she worried out loud.
    </p>
<p>
     If not for the seriousness of Wanda‚Äôs tone, Agatha would have laughed. ‚ÄúNatasha Romanov has been in love with you for 25 years. She has handled every single thing that has come your way with poise, grace, and, at times, violence if needed. You two found ways to be together in your own way, and now you truly get to be together again. I have never seen a love as pure as the one between you. That woman would marry you the second the divorce was finalized, and Vision would hand you the rings. You think he didn‚Äôt know? He absolutely did. As for the boys? No one will say a thing, and if they did? Between Lilia, Rio, Alice, and Nicky? They‚Äôll be fine. Don‚Äôt let other people get into your head and try to ruin your happiness, angel. I will always defend you, and you know it. I will burn my whole life down to protect our family, and don‚Äôt you forget it.‚Äù Agatha squeezed Wanda‚Äôs shoulders as a few tears of her own fell. She had always been protective of Wanda and tried to shield her from all negativity, speculation, and anything she could. Wanda had had enough trauma in her life before she had even come to America, she didn‚Äôt need more of it, and Agatha had spent nearly 30 years trying to keep it that way.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda nodded and pulled away so she could look at Agatha. ‚ÄúI went to Rio that night. The night you and Nat were in New York? You trust her so much, so I knew I could too. We, Vision and I, were helping the boys with homework, and for a moment, I, I don‚Äôt know, hallucinated?. That Vision was actually Nat. I nearly lost it. So I texted Rio, and when homework was over, I went to her place. We got drunk, and I told her everything. She was the one that gave me the final push I needed. I told her not to tell you, to let me be the one to tell you that I went to her instead of you.‚Äù Wanda confessed, chewing on her lip.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled softly. ‚ÄúI knew. She didn‚Äôt tell me. I just knew. I also noticed the two of you have been closer since then, and it means a lot to me. I‚Äôm glad it was her, and I‚Äôm just happy you finally did it. Now, stop worrying. Nat will be home soon, and the two of you can go spend the night together. Forget the speculation from a tiny, tiny portion of fans. The majority still think Vision just doesn‚Äôt like the spotlight or that you and I are dating. Though now a lot think we might have broken up.‚Äù Agatha looked up as she heard the door open.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio walked in and saw tears drying. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù She asked, concern in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, nothing, sweetie. Wanda just had a moment, everything got sentimental, and emotions happened.‚Äù Agatha answered, not noticing the nickname she had used.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda‚Äôs eyebrows shot up as she looked between the two of them. Rio also raised an eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWell, okay,
     <em>
      darling
     </em>
     . Glad that happened before we left. I put my suitcase next to yours.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     She sat down next to Agatha as Wanda moved over. ‚ÄúI hate the people of the internet, by the way.‚Äù She was completely ignoring the ‚Äòsweetie‚Äô of it all.
    </p>
<p>
     The other women just nodded. Wanda grinned broadly, while Agatha ignored the ‚Äòdarling‚Äô of it all.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had flown before, but never on a private jet. Let alone a movie star‚Äôs private jet. Alice was taking care of Raven for the weekend, Rio had everything prepared to go back to school for the next week, and she had made sure that the only thing she had to focus on this weekend was New York and Agatha. She still wasn‚Äôt exactly sure how she had gotten here, but she was here. Agatha was now one of her closest friends, even if they were attracted to each other. They were clinging to stupid rules for reasons that held merit, apparently. Despite that, all the lines were blurred, and all the streams were crossed.
    </p>
<p>
     She was both confused and thinking clearly.
    </p>
<p>
     When she got to Agatha‚Äôs, the plan had been to get a few hours of sleep. Instead, the three of them talked until Nat got back, and Wanda attacked Nat with kisses. Absolutely planned by Wanda, Rio was sure of it. Once red-headed demons one and two had left, Rio and Agatha continued talking about New York until they headed to the airport, which was an experience just to be driven up to the plane.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, Rio sat in what felt more like an actual recliner on the plane that turned into more of a bed. Thankfully, this one was a double seat, and the arm came up.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúCan I sit next to you?‚Äù Agatha asked once they were in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOf course, I was slightly offended when you didn‚Äôt.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha got up and moved over, sitting next to Rio, not bothering to separate them with the armrest. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt laugh,‚Äù She paused, waiting for Rio‚Äôs response.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAfter all these years of flying all over the world, I still get airsick. I get seasick, too. I‚Äôm surprised I don‚Äôt get carsick. So I sit by myself on take-off and landing just in case. Usually, it‚Äôs just the feeling, nothing else. I just don‚Äôt trust it.‚Äù She searched Rio‚Äôs face for any judgment, laughter, any negativity at all. She knew it was slightly ridiculous as she had been flying almost her entire life.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just looked back with empathy. ‚ÄúIn middle school, I got sick on the bus on a field trip. It was awful. I absolutely get it.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúTHAT wasn‚Äôt your most embarrassing moment?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou asked about high school, not middle school. Once in college, I got so drunk at a party and threw up all over this girl I was dating. She completely freaked out and broke up with me, said she couldn‚Äôt handle anyone that vomited,‚Äù Rio laughed at the memory. ‚ÄúTurns out I had been sick. She didn‚Äôt care. Puking was a red flag, apparently.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head as she laughed. ‚ÄúIf someone I cared about got sick, no matter what the cause, I would just take care of them because that‚Äôs what you do when you care about someone.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAgatha Harkness, award-winning megastar, one of the most famous women in the world, the best mother ever, Hollywood‚Äôs bad-boy and womanizer, which I have found not to be true, activist, looks great in everything, the best friend anyone could have, protector of all, also has a heart of gold and cleans up puke. Who would have thought?‚Äù She was looking at Agatha with awe by the time she was done with her list. For years, she had idolized and fantasized about this woman, and now, Agatha was one of her best friends. She was Nicky‚Äôs teacher, and she so badly wished Nicky could transfer to another teacher, but no one else taught her subjects.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew she needed to confide in Rio. She still didn‚Äôt know when the perfect time would be. Here she was, staring into those beautiful brown eyes that she could get lost in, breathing in the eucalyptus scent, wanting so badly to close the distance between them. However, she knew they had to lay everything out before that happened.
     <em>
      Coward.
     </em>
     Instead, she just sighed. ‚ÄúWe should probably try and get some sleep. Want to sleep with me on an airplane?‚Äù She gave Rio a comically exaggerated wink.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio giggled in the way only Agatha could make her do, which elicited a snort of laughter from Agatha. She was exhausted, and they had another four hours to go. They both needed some semblance of sleep as she yawned after her giggle fit and nodded. She reclined her seat as Agatha did the same while handing her a blanket. Rio wasn‚Äôt ready to tell Agatha everything, but she was done pretending like she didn‚Äôt want to melt into her when they slept, and the crew and security aboard the plane had all signed ironclad NDAs and most likely been threatened by Nat. She lay on her side, curled up against Agatha, head on her shoulder, arm over her stomach, leg over hers. Rio positioned herself before she could overthink it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stiffened at first when Rio had assumed her position and then relaxed once she settled. No wonder their friends were teasing them so much lately. She wrapped her arms around Rio and scooted a bit closer. Agatha knew that in their sleep they tended to end up intertwined, but deliberately falling asleep like this? She could get used to it. She wanted to get used to it.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha‚Äôs alarm went off a few hours later. They were roughly an hour away from landing. It was about eight-thirty California time but eleven-thirty New York time. She knew Rio‚Äôs body was going to be thrown off. Agatha was used to this.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised her head, ‚ÄúAre we there yet?‚Äù She looked around, blinking.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNot yet, kid. We have about an hour,‚Äù She raised their seats. ‚ÄúAre you hungry?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio yawned and stretched as she was forced into a seated position. ‚ÄúMaybe a granola bar? Something light. I‚Äôm going to change first, though,‚Äù She got up and grabbed the backpack she had brought on board, her suitcase in the cargo area, and walked to the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched her go. The longer they were friends, the more she noticed, and the harder it was to hide her feelings. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an actress, Harkness, fake it,‚Äù she muttered to herself.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha loved New York, and she was excited to have Rio by her side. She had to run by the studio first, though it wouldn‚Äôt take long, and Rio had insisted on going with her. Rio felt weird going to Agatha‚Äôs apartment without her and didn‚Äôt mind spending time around actors she admired.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They walked onto the set, and Agatha hugged some of her friends and people they knew, introducing Rio to everyone. Rio smiled as several people gave Agatha knowing smiles as she had talked about Rio just a bit earlier in the week. A few former castmates were guest-starring this week as well, Kate McKinnon being one of Rio‚Äôs favorites.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat in a room backstage, scrolling on her phone as Agatha quickly ran through a few skits. Rehearsal would last most of the day tomorrow, but some things had changed, and they wanted to go over some things a few extra times today. Rio heard footsteps and looked up to see two of the cast members, Heidi and Chloe, coming towards her. Riosmiled before greeting them. ‚ÄúI hate to sound like a total fangirl, but Heidi, I love you in What We Do in the Shadows, and your annoying coworker Crystal‚Äôs character is spot on. Chloe, your impressions are fantastic, and the skit with Wanda a few weeks ago where the two of you made fun of the whole Wagatha thing was hilarious. I can‚Äôt believe you didn‚Äôt break.‚Äù She said, her eyes going between both of them.
    </p>
<p>
     They both smiled and thanked her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAnd you must be Rio. Agatha talks a lot about you,‚Äù Chloe looked at her, ‚Äúare you two dating?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head and did her best to laugh. ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre close friends. We‚Äôre not dating.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Heidi nodded and glanced at Chloe knowingly. ‚ÄúAgatha mentioned she was taking you out tonight, and she always goes to the same place, so maybe we‚Äôll see you. Bye!‚Äù She waved as they left. Rio raised an eyebrow as she watched them leave. Agatha came up beside her not a minute later.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAre you ready to go?‚Äù Agatha asked. She had seen and heard the entire exchange.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded as Agatha led the way. Still slightly confused. Where did Agatha always go?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The Manhattan apartment was huge. Wagatha had converted the entire top floor of the building into one large residence.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThis is my room,‚Äù Agatha said, walking into one of the largest master suites Rio had ever seen. There was a black four-post California king bed with purple bedding and more pillows than she could count. All of the furniture was solid black wood, and dark hardwood floors continued through the entire home. Rio noticed a private balcony through sliding glass doors and a huge en-suite. Double doors led to a closet that she was sure was the size of her bedroom at home.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou can share with me or take the room across the hall.‚Äù She added softly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought about it. They had to keep at least a dotted line of a boundary, though. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take the room across the hall, but I‚Äôm still sharing a bed with you, Harkness. You know, tradition at this point.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Agatha said with a smirk, ‚ÄúTradition.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They had both taken to their separate bedrooms to shower and get dressed for the evening. Rio was double-checking everything. She had chosen black high-heeled ankle boots and a black clutch to go with the red dress. Her hair was down in loose waves, with a smokey eye and a dark red lipstick. Small, simple silver hoops completed the look. She took a deep breath and looked at herself in the mirror. ‚ÄúAlright, Rio Fucking Vidal. Go for it.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     She walked into the main room of the home, her heels clacking on the hardwood, and for the second time that week, was blown away by Agatha Harkness. Agatha was wearing a black and white corset top that buttoned in the front with black tapered pants that were perfectly tailored to her, and black heels. Her hair was somehow tamed and pulled back into a low ponytail. Rio wanted to undo each button personally. Her make-up was light, and she just oozed
     <em>
      Agatha Fucking Harkness, Queen of Fucking Everything.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha heard Rio walk in as she texted Nicky to check on him. She raised her eyes and almost dropped her phone. She put it away as she gathered her composure and her ability to function for the second time that week. Rio was gorgeous, but in this outfit, her natural beauty and sexiness were brought out and on display. She exuded confidence, and Agatha wanted to push her up against the wall and test out how kiss-proof the lipstick was. She would have to remember to thank Wanda. She had a feeling this dress was her doing.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve told you this recently, but you are gorgeous,‚Äù Agatha said softly, eyes locked on Rio‚Äôs. Part of her really wanted to say ‚ÄòThat dress looks amazing, it would look even better on the floor of my bedroom‚Äô, but she was trying not to be
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     woman anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blushed but didn‚Äôt break the eye contact. ‚ÄúYou have said something to that effect, but I like hearing it. Especially from you.‚Äù She broke the contact long enough to look her up and down, making it obvious she was checking her out. ‚ÄúYou are beautiful yourself, Harkness,‚Äù She got right next to Agatha and said softly in her ear, ‚ÄúSexiest woman alive.‚Äù Before gently brushing past her and grabbing her black peacoat. ‚ÄúReady to go, m‚Äôlady?‚Äù Rio had a plan. They would go out, come back, and as they lay in bed, Rio would tell her everything. Hopefully, Agatha would share, and they would make their decision. She was tired of going back and forth, tired of walking around it. It was time to lay everything out on the table and decide if they could do this.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha‚Äôs breath had hitched in her throat when Rio called her the sexiest woman alive. It was a title she had received before. Plenty of women had called her sexy. However, hearing it from Rio was different. It held more meaning. She turned and grabbed the jacket for her outfit and her clutch, following Rio. Agatha was hoping that tonight would be the night that they talked, laid it all out, and realized they could do this. She wanted Rio more than she had wanted anyone or anything else in her life. At the premiere on Wednesday, Agatha watched that scene imagining that Wanda was Rio. It had been quite the fantasy, but she wanted the real thing. Not this weekend, necessarily, but soon. She just so desperately wanted to finally kiss Rio and find out if it was all fireworks, stars, kittens, and rainbows like she thought it would be.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha took Rio to one of her favorite places for dinner, ensuring they had a private area. Jen had previously set it up for them, though it was known she was in town since she was hosting SNL this weekend, so paparazzi pictures had been taken. Agatha had taken a moment in between courses to ask Rio what she wanted her to post on the official socials. ‚ÄúSince you went to a premiere with me and you‚Äôre being seen with me here, there‚Äôs going to be speculation. I like to address things on my socials so I can control the narrative. What would you like me to say?‚Äù She asked, trying to pry into Rio‚Äôs thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew what Agatha was doing, and she refused to show her hand. ‚ÄúWe can wait a few days to see if it settles down first? After that, maybe post that we‚Äôre just close friends?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúPerfect.‚Äù
     <em>
      Or we can talk this weekend, and I can tell them we‚Äôre dating.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     They ate while Agatha told Rio about New York and different things about SNL, making Rio laugh with different stories. When they finished, she propped her chin on her hand and looked over at Rio, ‚ÄúWe have two options. We can go back home, or we go to an invite-only lesbian club that‚Äôs owned by a celebrity friend of mine. Your choice,‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought about it for a moment. She was so nervous about talking, and while they had each had a martini with dinner, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to go dancing and drinking to help loosen up their nerves.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúTake me dancing!‚Äù She said with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was a tad disappointed but also excited to take her out. They had all night and tomorrow night, plus the flight back. The night was still young and showing her off would be fun.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The club had a strict ‚Äòno phone, no pictures‚Äô rule, which had probably saved Agatha a lot of bad publicity over the years. The music was loud, and there were many high-profile women. Rio took it all in while she could before Agatha was swarmed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had forgotten exactly why she was so popular here.
    </p>
<p>
     Because up until Agatha met Rio, Agatha fucked. A lot.
     <em>
      Shit.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio just watched as women were all over Agatha. Famous women, high profile women, random women.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe told you she comes to the same place.‚Äù A familiar voice said in Rio‚Äôs ear as another woman handed Rio a shot. She looked over to see Chloe and Heidi. Rio nodded. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what you meant at the time. Cheers,‚Äù she said, raising the shot and then downing it.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe need more of these,‚Äù Chloe said as she disappeared.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was trying to escape the attention while being polite. Three shots later and a drink in hand, she got to Rio. ‚ÄúI am so sorry!‚Äù She said joining Rio and her two companions.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio masked her jealousy well, smiling at Agatha.¬† ‚ÄúNo problem! I‚Äôve been drinking a bit,‚Äù She gestured to a table holding a few shot glasses, drink in hand. ‚ÄúLooks like people missed you. Who‚Äôs the drink from?‚Äù She asked, feigning innocence.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. ‚ÄúA singer.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     They were interrupted by someone asking Agatha to dance. Some actress from a TV show that Rio didn‚Äôt really watch. Agatha turned towards Rio to say something.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn‚Äôt believe that Agatha was going to ask her for permission to dance with someone else when Rio was so close to finally confessing her feelings to Agatha. She just nodded and waved her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was shocked Rio was telling her to go off with someone else! She was about to tell this woman that she couldn‚Äôt dance with her, and Rio was drinking and acting like it was no big deal. Two could play this game. She pointed to a VIP booth to the side to let Rio know she‚Äôd meet her there, downed her drink and set it on the table, grabbed the other actress's hand, and stormed off.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had other plans. She told Heidi to get more shots and showed her where to take them, took Chloe by the wrist, and led her out to where they were close enough to Agatha and whoever the fuck, to clearly be seen by her. Chloe laughed and leaned close to Rio‚Äôs ear so she could be heard, ‚ÄúAre we playing the ‚Äòmake my just-a-friend‚Äô jealous game?‚Äù she asked. Rio made a guilty face, and Chloe nodded with a grin. ‚ÄúPermission to play along?‚Äù Rio nodded. Maybe it was the alcohol, but she automatically trusted her and knew that if anyone could make this look semi-believable, it was Chloe.
    </p>
<p>
     Chloe leaned in close to her ear. ‚ÄúThat dress looks amazing on you and Agatha is extremely lucky.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blushed and lightly smacked her arm, ‚ÄúChloe! Stop! You‚Äôre making me blush!‚Äù She laughed, Chloe was quickly becoming a friend, and she recognized the flirting was deliberate and innocent.
    </p>
<p>
     Chloe quickly glanced at Agatha, who was shooting daggers at her before dancing even closer to Rio and leaning in again, ‚ÄúWe have her attention. Try to keep eye contact with her, glare, give her fuck-me eyes, whatever. Just make sure she knows that you wanted me to be here later so she doesn‚Äôt murder me, okay?‚Äù Chloe instructed before she spun Rio around by the hips, pressed their bodies together, and guided their dancing. Rio followed and let her lead. She found Agatha, who was running her hands through her hair and glaring at Rio as she was doing some type of hip thrust against a supermodel half her age. Rio was young, but not that young. Agatha looked directly at Rio, fire in her eyes, and bit her lip. Rio saw that Agatha was also here to play, and Rio was finding that a jealous Agatha was doing things to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did not get jealous. She had everything she wanted in life. Until now. Now, there was one untouchable person because neither of them could use their words like adults. Instead, here they were, grinding on other women like teenagers, giving each other bedroom eyes across a crowded dance floor to highly suggestive music. She hoped Chloe was acting right now because her hands on Rio‚Äôs bare skin went past friendly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ran her tongue over her bottom lip as she put her hand on top of Chloe‚Äôs and guided it down her thigh, eyes screaming, ‚Äòthis should be you.‚Äô
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could feel the heat low in her abdomen, but she could also feel the tightening in her chest. She had no right to Rio. They weren‚Äôt dating. They hadn‚Äôt even confessed feelings for each other. Yet at this moment, Agatha wanted to part the sea of bodies, rip her out of Chloe‚Äôs arms, pull Rio against her, and kiss her in a way that made it very clear to everyone that Rio was off limits. Agatha was not territorial or possessive, but Rio just brought out something primal in her. Agatha was also too competitive for this.¬† She was going to double down. She could own Rio from afar. It was then that Andie, her friend and club owner, walked by. She caught her arm and slid behind her. She leaned in and spoke in her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMaking someone jealous, play along.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Andie understood the assignment as she turned around and pressed herself against Agatha. What Rio couldn‚Äôt see was that Andie was laughing the entire time.
    </p>
<p>
     Who is that, now? Rio thought. Agatha hadn‚Äôt had to do much but whisper in someone‚Äôs ear, and now another gorgeous celebrity was already rubbing herself against Agatha. Rio gave up, she couldn‚Äôt outact an Oscar winner or apparently, out seduce her. Plus,¬† the longer she saw Agatha grind on that blonde in a way that was borderline sex, she wanted to scream. Rio tapped Chloe‚Äôs wrist as she turned around. ‚ÄúDrinks,‚Äù she demanded as she led her towards the table. Heidi raised an eyebrow, seeing them return.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúTrying to make Agatha jealous?‚Äù She asked, drinking water.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took two shots. ‚ÄúHow did you know?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Heidi looked at Chloe and then back to Rio. ‚ÄúThe way she‚Äôs talked about you this week, and the way you two look at each other. You like her and she likes you. I‚Äôm surprised she brought you here. What a bad idea for someone she genuinely likes. Maybe this is her trying?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Chloe nodded. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know her super well, and the woman has a reputation. We see her here a lot.‚Äù She added that last bit in a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was already well into drunken territory, and her common sense failed her as she took two more shots. This wasn‚Äôt what she had wanted from the night, and she doubted her ability to handle any of this. Rio was racing towards blackout drunk when Agatha joined them.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHaving fun?‚Äù Agatha asked as Rio stumbled into her. ‚ÄúHow much have you had to drink?‚Äù She looked at her, startled concern etched into her face.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNot sure,‚Äù Rio replied, straightening up. Everything she had eaten at dinner was alcohol-soaked, and she felt like the excess was going straight to her head.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn‚Äôt sober, far from it, but she was nowhere near where Rio now. Agatha had been drinking since she was a child and could drink just about anyone under the table. She took one of the remaining shots from the table before turning to Rio. ‚ÄúAre you too drunk to dance?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs heart raced and she went pale as she shook her head so hard she almost fell over. Agatha put her hand on Rio‚Äôs waist to steady her. This was what Rio had been waiting for, and she was drunk.
     <em>
      Good job.
     </em>
     She downed another drink, for courage, and let Agatha lead her back to the floor just as a remix of
     <em>
      ‚ÄúRed Wine Supernova‚Äù
     </em>
     came on. Rio smiled and looked down, her face already flushed from the alcohol, still gained an added blush.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Agatha asked in her ear as they moved to the music.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúJust, this fucking song.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúFitting?‚Äù Agatha asked with her signature smirk. Fuck being subtle. It‚Äôs not like they were good at it anymore and the alcohol was not helping.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúPerfectly,‚Äù Rio replied with a smirk of her own as she tried to give Agatha a smoldering look, but realized she was extremely drunk as she rolled her hips into Agatha‚Äôs at the ‚Äúwant me to fuck you?‚Äù line.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha‚Äôs eyes went dark with need. They needed to have that talk, and now. Not in some club, not in the car with people listening, but at home. She gripped Rio‚Äôs wrist and pulled her towards the door. She caught Heidi‚Äôs gaze and waved. Agatha knew her tab would be automatically closed, and she‚Äôd shoot a text to Andie later.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let Agatha lead her out of the club. Hell, she‚Äôd let Agatha lead her into the woods and drain her of her life force. She didn‚Äôt care. Rio was drunk and she needed Agatha in more ways than one. They needed to get back to the apartment and talk. Rio couldn‚Äôt remember the words which she had practiced in her head so many times,¬† but knew it would come to her. As the car door shut behind them, Agatha handed Rio a bottle of water. ‚ÄúI need you to dilute some of that alcohol. I‚Äôm drunk, but you‚Äôre blitzed.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio downed the water, knowing whatever it was they were about to do required more than half of a functioning brain cell. She stared at Agatha. She was so pretty, and famous, and perfect. How had Rio gotten to this point in her life? She was about to do something, she wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what, with Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha drank her water slowly. She was careful not to move Rio too roughly or push her too hard. She was worried about her. How many drinks did Rio have when I wasn‚Äôt looking?¬† Her answer was apparent as Rio looked a little green around the edges. Agatha needed her to hold out till they could at least talk. Maybe just finally kiss? She wanted so much more, but¬† Agatha never took advantage of those situations. They made it home and up to the apartment, Rio leaning heavily against Agatha as they hung up their coats, tossing aside Rio‚Äôs heels that had come off in the car. Agatha sighed in relief. She hated wearing heels but liked the extra height. She turned Rio toward her, hands lightly on her waist. Rio brought her hands up and placed them on Agatha‚Äôs shoulders, looking at her, Rio‚Äôs brown eyes were bloodshot but full of emotions that Agatha couldn‚Äôt quite place.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha brought her hand up, tucking Rio‚Äôs hair behind her ear as Rio leaned into the touch, sighing as she stepped closer. Agatha leaned their foreheads together, it was intimate and they were so close,
     <em>
      not yet,
     </em>
     she told herself. ‚ÄúWe need to talk,‚Äù she whispered, her lips almost touching Rio‚Äôs.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAgatha, I‚Ä¶‚Äù Rio started. Suddenly, she pushed Agatha back, eyes full of alarm as she ran towards the nearest bathroom. Agatha sighed heavily as she followed her, hearing the undeniable sounds of too much partying coming back up.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha, true to what she had said no less than twenty-four hours earlier, pulled Rio‚Äôs hair back in a loose ponytail and placed a cool washcloth on her neck as she rubbed her back. Rio had definitely tried to hang with the professionals.
    </p>
<p>
     While Rio brushed her teeth in Agatha‚Äôs bathroom and cleaned up a bit, Agatha pulled out pajamas for her. A green tank top and short set with lace down the sides that she knew was Wanda‚Äôs doing. Rio came out of the bathroom with wobbly legs and looked at Agatha with big brown eyes. ‚ÄúWill you help me?‚Äù She asked in the most vulnerable tone Agatha had ever heard come from Rio‚Äôs lips. The dress was complicated and she couldn‚Äôt work it in her state.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded as she found the zipper on the side with the most fabric. She carefully unzipped it, still facing Rio. She was trying her best not to touch Rio‚Äôs skin. Rio wasn‚Äôt wearing a bra, and Agatha was painfully aware of that fact as she quickly turned around and faced away from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAgatha,‚Äù Rio‚Äôs voice trembled as Agatha heard the sound of fabric hitting the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù Agatha tried to keep her own voice steady and normal, though it came out a bit breathy.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou can look. We‚Äôre grown adults,‚Äù Rio said, placing a hand on her shoulder, partly to stabilize herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was still facing the other direction. ‚ÄúRio, you‚Äôre drunk. I‚Äôm not going to take advantage of you. Contrary to popular belief, I am not that kind of girl.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio removed her hand and sat on the bed so she wouldn‚Äôt fall over while she put her clothes on. Agatha was right. Rio was drunk, and she had lost her chance. ‚ÄúAnd they say chivalry is dead.‚Äù Rio joked, trying to mask her disappointment. Her head started to swim again. She really needed to stop drinking around Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the gays keeping it alive. I‚Äôm going to change. Get in bed,‚Äù she ordered as she grabbed a pile of clothes and walked to the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOoh. Yes, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Rio tried to say seductively, but she was slurring her words again.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha just sighed. ‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt hurt yourself,‚Äù she added.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was thankful for the pajamas she had in her dresser. The ones in her suitcase were the same as Rio‚Äôs, except purple. She had rolled her eyes and smiled at Wanda‚Äôs cheekiness when she pulled them out. Tonight was not the night for those, though. She knew the lace would show off sideboob, and drunk McGee in there didn‚Äôt need that temptation. Instead, it was plaid flannel pajama pants and an old promo shirt from The Witches‚Äô Road. She had also decided a bra was necessary.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo temptations.‚Äù She told herself in the mirror, for me or her.
    </p>
<p>
     When she joined Rio in bed, her very inebriated companion was half asleep. Agatha lay on her side facing her, ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù She asked.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThe room is spinning, and I think I might fall off the planet,‚Äù Rio said sleepily, eyes half open.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew now was not the time for sharing their deep, dark secrets. She didn‚Äôt blame Rio for what transpired tonight. It wasn‚Äôt her fault. They had engaged in a power struggle and completely lost the plot. Agatha knew she was afraid of opening up to Rio. She wanted to, but what if Rio wasn‚Äôt willing to accept the part of Agatha that didn‚Äôt know how to be loved and accepted for who she was? She had been rejected for being famous and kept a secret. So what if that was decades ago, even before she had Nicky. It had still turned her off from the whole serious relationship thing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was struggling to stay awake. She wanted to tell Agatha about San Francisco, about what‚Äôs her name, but she couldn‚Äôt form words. It probably wouldn‚Äôt have made sense anyway. She felt awful for drinking so much, but had she really been ready to open up? To be rejected? Would Agatha date her, knowing she potentially still had a crazed stalker out there somewhere? It was too much. Her eyelids were heavy, her brain hurt, and she needed to sleep. She slung her arm over Agatha‚Äôs middle and clumsily scooted closer to her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNight Aggie. I‚Äôm sorry I fucked up,‚Äù she mumbled. Her eyes had closed, and her words were barely audible.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou have nothing to apologize for. Good night, Ri,‚Äù Agatha didn‚Äôt always call her Ri, only sparingly since it felt so intimate. They were going on three months of friendship, and she realized they were more than friends at this point. Rio began to snore a few minutes later as only the drunkest do, and Agatha chuckled. She twisted a little to look at Rio‚Äôs face. She kissed her on the forehead and whispered, ‚Äúyou might be worth the risk.‚Äù She went to sleep as she thought about all of the pros and cons.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Things were strangely awkward on Saturday. Neither woman acknowledged anything from the night before. Rio was clearly hungover and felt awful about how things had unfolded, choosing silence over apologies. Agatha was acting normal for the most part but acting like they hadn‚Äôt shared any intimate moments. The women had gotten dressed and had a quiet breakfast, making small talk about the day ahead of them before going to the SNL studio. There, Agatha rehearsed and got ready while Rio hung out with Chappell Roan‚Äôs girlfriend, of all people. It was quite the experience, and they got along swimmingly, helping the day fly by without forcing Rio to think about last night or confront it with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     It was roughly half an hour until show time, and Agatha hadn‚Äôt spoken to Rio most of the day. The show was about to begin, and she had no idea where Rio even was. Things had been awkward all day, and she hated it. Rio had barely said anything to her since breakfast. They had been so close last night, but she wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what had happened. Wanda had checked in earlier, and Agatha just told her they drank too much. She‚Äôd fill her in later.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was avoiding Agatha. That hadn‚Äôt been her intention when she woke up that morning, but it was now her tool of choice. She knew she‚Äôd have to face her after the show, but that was future Rio‚Äôs problem. Rio did want to wish Agatha luck though, and that was her current conflict. The good friend in her won, as she walked up to Agatha, who wore a flattering white suit for her monologue.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHey, break a leg tonight. You‚Äôre going to be amazing. You always are.‚Äù She said, walking up behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned around and smiled. NOW Rio was talking to her, and she didn‚Äôt sound mad or upset. A wave of relief washed over Agatha.¬† No matter what happened or was going on in that head of hers, Rio was still there to support her. Agatha hadn‚Äôt realized that it would mean so much to her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she responded.¬† What‚Äôd you do today? I didn‚Äôt see you around much.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio noticed the sadness in Agatha‚Äôs eyes as she said it, and she felt the pain in her own chest, knowing she had caused it.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI hung out with Chappell Roan and her girlfriend, talked to Chloe and Heidi when they weren‚Äôt busy, met Kate McKinnon and fan girl‚Äôd there, talked to Keenan, oh, and met Colin and Michael.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you had a good day. The show‚Äôs about to start. See you in a bit.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rushed off with a sweet smile on her face. Now that she had confirmation Rio was done avoiding her, she wanted to get back in the right headspace to host a live show.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha‚Äôs face told Rio everything she needed. Not only had Rio ruined last night, but she hurt the one woman she truly cared about today. I need to fix it when we get back to Agatha‚Äôs later, she thought. For now, she took her reserved spot in the audience and got ready to watch the great Agatha Harkness dazzle everyone. Rio had watched Agatha countless times on screens, but seeing her live was an altogether different experience. It almost canceled out her awkward and negative feelings from the night before. Before she knew it, the show was over and Rio was determined to make up for last night.
    </p>
<p>
     The show ended, and Agatha found Rio quickly. She needed to know why she had been avoiding her all day, but not here. But, just in case, Agatha was going to give her an out: ‚ÄúSome people are going to go‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cut her off. ‚ÄúNo. We‚Äôre going to your place.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded, relieved that Rio had chosen to return with her instead.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They had changed into pajamas and were sitting in the bed facing each other. Agatha had opened her mouth to start talking when Rio held her hand up.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWait. I need to say something first. I am so sorry about last night and today. I spent today avoiding you because of everything that happened last night and how awkward I made things. I came here with a plan, but it didn‚Äôt go the way I thought it would. I think part of my drinking was needing courage, but I know that if I needed to drink to have the courage to talk, then Agatha, I‚Äôm not ready.‚Äù The look on her face was earnest, and there was regret and pain in her eyes. She hated herself for not being ready.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. If she were being honest with herself, she wasn‚Äôt quite there either. She nodded, her own blue eyes meeting Rio‚Äôs, filled with the same pain and sadness. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, and we can‚Äôt force it. No matter how tempting it may be.,‚Äù Agatha said softly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed heavily. ‚ÄúI doubt either of us will go to sleep quickly.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Agatha laid on her back and put her arm out. ‚ÄúCome here.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio assumed her position against Agatha, head on her shoulder, arm and leg over her. ‚ÄúWhy is this so natural?‚Äù Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a very comforting presence.‚Äù Agatha smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. ‚ÄúYou must be. Confession. Ever since the Ballad of the Witches‚Äô Road came out, it‚Äôs been on my sleep playlist. All iterations of it. Several of your songs have been from over the years. Your voice has always calmed me and helped me go to sleep. When we met that day at SHIELD? I even fell asleep to The Ballad that night,‚Äù Rio knew her face was bright pink from her confession, but she didn‚Äôt care. It was important to share something personal, even if minor compared to the confession still locked up within.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked down at Rio, the small divulgence rolling around in her mind. She had comforted this woman for years and hadn‚Äôt even known it. Sure, she heard things like this all the time, but coming from Rio was, as always, different and felt special. ‚ÄúYou can tell me that, but‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different, Harkness.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThank you for sharing that with me. It makes me feel very special, and now I know how to get you to sleep.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou are special, and having Agatha Harkness sing me a lullaby? Dream come true.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWell, then prepare yourself,‚Äù She smiled into Rio‚Äôs hair as she began to sing,
     <em>
      ‚ÄúDown, down, down the road‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     If you had told 22-year-old Rio that Agatha Fucking Harkness would one day be one of her best friends and hold Rio in her arms while singing The Ballad to help her get to sleep, Rio would ask you to share whatever drugs you were on. Yet here she was, living that exact scenario, with zero drugs involved.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt Rio succumb to sleep as she sang and softly ran her fingers through Rio‚Äôs hair. Agatha thought it was one of the sweetest and most intimate things she had ever experienced. She didn‚Äôt understand how she could have these extremely intimate moments with Rio, yet to profess that which rattled about her core and begged for release scared the hell out of her.
     <em>
      Because you‚Äôre afraid she‚Äôll reject you, and you can‚Äôt handle losing her.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The return flight was rather uneventful, and they both knew they wouldn‚Äôt be able to see each other much the next few weeks. Agatha shared everything with Wanda Sunday evening. Wanda seriously considered slightly maiming her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI told you that taking her to ‚ÄòThe Hex‚Äô was a bad idea!‚Äù Wanda practically shouted.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat was at football practice with Nicky. The last game of the season was Friday, and they were playing Bayside again before playoffs began. SHIELD was undefeated and had already secured their spot. Bayside had to win on Friday to earn theirs.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI thought it would be fun! And it was fun but also a bad idea. It turned out, though, that neither of us was ready to have that discussion. And we‚Äôve agreed to hold off that conversation until we are both ready. Not to force or rush it.‚Äù Agatha looked at her, knowing she would understand.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda deflated. ‚ÄúI know, I just was hoping for a summer wedding,‚Äù she teased.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha froze. She was trying to get the courage to date someone, which was already a leap from her fuck and forget days. She was NOT in love and nowhere near marriage. And here was Wanda talking about weddings.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, what? Absolutely not. That is, just. No. Your wedding, maybe.‚Äù Agatha was short-circuiting.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda laughed. ‚ÄúWHOA! Okay, I struck a nerve there. Also, no, we haven‚Äôt talked about it either, though I do want to marry Nat. I‚Äôd marry her yesterday if I could.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI know you would,‚Äù Agatha said, putting a hand on Wanda‚Äôs. ‚ÄúBack to me, though. What do I do now?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou have an extremely busy schedule leading up to Halloween. You focus on that. Go cheer Nicky at the football game, and go nerd out together at the party. You‚Äôre there together anyway.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised. That was a very mature answer.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt choose any days in the betting pool for the next two weeks.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI hate you.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou fucking love me.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice and Rio's conversations were mirror images of the ones that Wanda and Agatha had, as if in parallel universes. Ultimately, Alice conceded that she was proud of Rio for not forcing the issue no matter how much she had hoped otherwise.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The next two weeks had gone by quickly. Rio fell back into the school routine, and that Friday, Bayside beat SHIELD. Both teams would be in the playoffs the day after Halloween. Agatha was engrossed in filming, and while it was in LA, it often ran late. They texted, but many nights, it was just to say good night. They watched Halloween movies on their Saturday night, and they ended up falling asleep halfway through Hocus Pocus.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Finally, Halloween arrived, and with it the annual party. They were at some venue owned by Tony Stark. He held the party for the older kids and adults, around 10, and it transitioned to an adults-only event. Stark could be a pretentious asshole, but he liked parties and tried to do right by his daughter.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had on THE Moiraine traveling costume, a blue shirt and pants, boots, and a long blue coat with leather on the shoulders. Her long brown hair loose about her shoulders.¬† She loved the way she could use the coat as a cape and be dramatic with it. Rio was dressed as Moiraine‚Äôs nemesis, Lanfear. She had forgone the headpiece, but the black leather dress looked amazing on her. The right sleeve was long, and the shoulder was puffy. There were straps around the neck, and criss-cross straps on the left shoulder, otherwise that side was sleeveless. The neckline went straight across her chest with a studded belt right below her breasts. There was a piece in the middle of the dress that came down to the top of her knee that was separate from the sides of her dress, that split on both sides at the top of her thighs, giving a cape-like effect that went to her ankles. She had on wedge platform boots that laced up to mid-thigh and three black leather cuffs on her left wrist. She looked every bit the part of the evil lover of the devil she was portraying.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice and Jen were dressed in the classic Xena and Gabrielle costumes from the 90‚Äôs TV show, and Wanda still did the Fiyero and Glinda bit with Vision. It was even funnier knowing that Wanda was in love with Nat, dressed in a green and black suit, giving subtle Elphaba vibes. They were all team Gelphie, themselves. Tommy and Nicky were running around as zombies, and Billy and Eddie were Wiccan and Hulkling from The Young Avengers comics.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHave they confirmed they‚Äôre dating yet?‚Äù Rio asked Wanda, nodding at the boys.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo, but look at them. I wish he would just tell me.‚Äù She gestured at the two teenagers leaning into each other and acting like they were the only two people who existed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre adorable.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre more put together than you and Agatha,‚Äù Wanda looked at her knowingly.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, so you heard about New York?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYes, I did. And, close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThank you for comparing my dating life to yard games and weapons.‚Äù Rio scoffed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhy are we talking about violence?‚Äù Agatha asked, walking up to them.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThe Xena and Gabby costumes.‚Äù Rio lied before Wanda could say anything.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go find my husband,‚Äù she looked at the ceiling before whispering, ‚Äúor my girlfriend,‚Äù and giggled. She had been drinking, and while she was keeping everything quiet until after the holidays, she was getting very impatient.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to get too bold, and someone‚Äôs going to find out.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúProbably,‚Äù Rio nodded. ‚ÄúAfter 25 years of hiding, can you blame her?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head, ‚ÄúNot at all. I‚Äôm so proud of her.‚Äù They were in a quiet area upstairs. ‚ÄúShe told me that you were the one she talked to who gave her the push.‚Äù Rio and Agatha were facing each other, bodies only a few feet apart.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAlice and Jen, Wanda and Nat.‚Äù Agatha smiled. They had both decided not to drink and were completely sober.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just your regular lesbian matchmaker. Maybe I can find someone for Vision after the divorce.‚Äù They both laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHonestly, you came into our group like a force of nature. It felt like you had always been one of us and truly belonged with us. With me. I can‚Äôt imagine our lives, my life, without you in it.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Eyes locked, they had moved closer together, separated by only inches.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a life without you in it, Agatha.‚Äù Rio‚Äôs eyes dropped to Agatha‚Äôs mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     Caught up in the moment, Agatha closed the space between them and wrapped her arms around Rio‚Äôs waist, pulling her flush against her, and pressed their lips together. Rio‚Äôs arms immediately went up and around Agatha‚Äôs shoulders as she pressed herself against Agatha, parting her lips to meet Agatha‚Äôs movements.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised her hand to cup Rio‚Äôs jaw as she slid her tongue against hers, deepening their kiss.
     <em>
      Finally,
     </em>
     Agatha thought. It was everything she had hoped and dreamed for months. They could go back to her place and talk. She was prepared. She was just so happy to finally kiss this amazing, beautiful woman.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs hand had slid into Agatha‚Äôs hair as she used her tongue to explore Agatha‚Äôs mouth. She withdrew momentarily to bite Agatha‚Äôs bottom lip and then swallowed the whimper that followed. She scratched lightly at Agatha‚Äôs scalp as they battled each other for control of the kiss. Rio wondered if they could go back to Agatha‚Äôs since they didn‚Äôt have school tomorrow. Then it hit her. This was Agatha Harkness. Mother of one of her students. They still hadn‚Äôt talked, and that needed to happen before this could continue.
     <em>
      Fuck.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio froze, eyes flying open as she released her grip on Agatha and stepped back and out of her embrace.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha‚Äôs eyes opened at the sudden loss. ‚ÄúRio?‚Äù She saw the panic in Rio‚Äôs eyes and realized what had happened. ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs okay, let‚Äôs talk.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs eyes were wide as she shook her head. ‚ÄúAgatha, I‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     She turned and bolted.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an idiot, Harkness,‚Äù Agatha pinched her nose before turning on her heel and going after her. She reached the top of the stairs before she felt a hand on her arm. She turned her head to see Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSometimes, you have to give people processing time before they‚Äôre ready to talk to you.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had run. They had known they needed to figure things out before jumping in, and yet, they hadn‚Äôt. Everything could be ruined, and Rio‚Äôs emotions and thoughts were too unstable to figure it out here. She had pulled her phone out of a hidden pocket and texted Alice to meet her in the front and that they were leaving. Adding SOS next to it. She was crying as she, Jen, and Alice left.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha found Wanda and Nat staring in confusion as they watched Alice‚Äôs ride leave with the three women inside. Agatha silently cried as she watched the car disappear.
    </p>
<p>
</p>

     Worst Halloween ever.

<span>
      Agatha Fucking Harkness had kissed her like a soldier returning from war, and now Rio was curled up on her couch, head in Alice‚Äôs lap, hugging Raven, sobbing like she‚Äôd been dumped on prom night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nothing made sense anymore.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio. It‚Äôs okay. Why can‚Äôt you just talk to Agatha about it now?‚Äù Alice asked, rubbing her back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm a coward, and what if she can‚Äôt accept it? What if it‚Äôs too much? We can‚Äôt go back. She‚Äôs one of my best friends, and now I know what it‚Äôs like to kiss her, and I will always want that,‚Äù She explained as the tears continued to fall.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice acted hurt, trying to lighten the mood, ‚ÄúWait a minute! We‚Äôve kissed!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen gasped from her spot in the armchair, ‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave a small smile as Alice laughed. ‚ÄúWe practiced kissing each other when we were in middle school,‚Äù Rio supplied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked relieved, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I was expecting, but that makes a lot of sense,‚Äù She regarded Rio for a moment. ‚ÄúAgatha won‚Äôt push you away, you know. She has an entire security team, everything will work out.‚Äù She paused momentarily, ‚ÄúHell, Nat would probably go after the ex personally, and no one gets past Nat.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice nodded. ‚ÄúRio, Agatha likes you, not just as a best friend, either.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged. ‚ÄúI just, I don‚Äôt know. There are a lot of other things too. The whole, she‚Äôs Agatha Fucking Harkness thing, for one.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen just groaned and looked at Alice. Alice looked at her de facto sister. ‚ÄúIf she wasn‚Äôt one of the most famous people in the world and a parent of one of your students, and you just met, what would you do?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI assume in this hypothetical, all the feelings are still there? I would ask her out,‚Äù Rio replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen respond to one of the ungodly number of texts she‚Äôs sent you in the past two hours since we‚Äôve left!‚Äù Jen nearly yelled, her tone bordering on frustration. It was only a matter of time before grainy photos leaked, and she still had a job to do.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio bit her lip. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt, okay! I can‚Äôt bring potential harm to their doorstep.‚Äù Fresh tears streaming down her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice squeezed her shoulder. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe here, and that bitch isn‚Äôt going to do anything.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled onto her back, looking up at Alice, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt trust it, and pictures are all over the internet now from the premiere and a few from New York. You know that demon has seen them, and she knows, and she is definitely the jealous type.‚Äù Rio knew for a fact that she had seen them, but she wasn‚Äôt telling anyone that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen moved over to the couch, putting Rio‚Äôs legs over hers, ‚ÄúYou two have never once told me this bitch‚Äôs name. Why?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like summoning Beetlejuice,‚Äù Alice scoffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not wrong. Also, when I say she‚Äôs a model, I mean somewhat well-known, and her husband IS well-known,‚Äù Rio added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYet, you‚Äôre worried about Agatha‚Äôs fame?‚Äù Jen shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI knew San Francisco was never going to make me public. Ever,‚Äù Rio shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen was filled with sadness for her friend. ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt a red flag for you?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked down at Rio. ‚ÄúThis one was collecting red flags like they were Pokemon. It‚Äôs why all of Agatha‚Äôs green ones scare her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha has her red flags, but they‚Äôre more from trauma,‚Äù Rio said, ignoring Alice‚Äôs very correct assessment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre more yellow, maybe orange,‚Äù Jen suggested. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt call them red.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat up, causing Raven to finally jump down. Rio crossed her legs and leaned back against the couch. ‚ÄúAgatha being more than willing to break the law, and breaking the law, might be a red flag‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúEh, depends on the reason,‚Äù Alice said, waving Rio off. ‚ÄúAnyway, back to the matter at hand. What are you going to do? You can‚Äôt just ignore her. It‚Äôs currently,‚Äù She checked her phone, ‚Äútwo in the morning, and there‚Äôs a football playoff game at six-ish tonight. You know you have to be there.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio groaned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, I can‚Äôt skip it. I have to support Nicky, and the rest of the team. With injuries, Tommy is playing in it. I‚Äôll figure it out.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt will just be awkward.‚Äù Jen mused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know what to do. We need to talk, but I don‚Äôt know how to start that conversation now. ‚ÄòThanks for kissing me in a way that might screw me up forever if it never happens again, but let me tell you about the time I was almost murdered and how I have a crazy ex-girlfriend who is also a stalker. Oh, and there‚Äôs a restraining order. A TEMPORARY restraining order because the judge is a fan of hers and her husband.‚Äô That will go over like a pregnant pole-vaulter.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen sighed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be ready for her to call the lawyers, call in favors, pull strings, the things Agatha does.‚Äù She put a comforting hand on Rio‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúEverything will be okay.‚Äù Rio nodded. ‚ÄúIf you guys think so. It‚Äôs just, my ex is a sociopath.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice put an arm across Rio‚Äôs shoulders. ‚ÄúI know she is honey, but we have a‚Ä¶former‚Ä¶assassin, two extremely powerful and connected actresses, a fixer, me - your knight of wands, and you, our mad scientist. It‚Äôs going to be fine. Right now, we need to focus on how you‚Äôre going to handle this.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sniffled. ‚ÄúLike an adult. Hug my cat, ignore the pretty girl, and drink.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Jen and Alice said simultaneously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to respond to her tonight or even talk to her in the next day or so, okay? You can take a break. However, you need to decide what you‚Äôre going to do. Tell her everything or decide you aren‚Äôt ready and take a few steps back?‚Äù Alice laid it out plainly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew she wanted to tell Agatha everything. She also knew that it wasn‚Äôt just dating parents, dating scared her as a whole. She had dated the crazy bitch for two years and been in love with her, and it had ended badly. She wanted Agatha, yes, but they were going to have to take this slowly, and she wasn‚Äôt sure if Agatha would be okay with that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was also what she wasn‚Äôt telling Alice and Jen, and that was that crazy pants had absolutely seen the pictures and had sent Rio a message from a blocked number. Rio had ignored it, hoping there would be zero follow-up, but it still existed.

      Wanda filled Vision in on what had happened, and he took over teenager duty while she and Nat took Agatha back to the compound. The boys were going to a co-ed sleepover, and Vision had volunteered to be one of the parent chaperones. No one had trusted a bunch of hormone-filled teenagers to be left to their own devices. They may be rich and famous, but they weren‚Äôt stupid.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Back at Agatha‚Äôs, free of makeup and in comfortable clothing, Agatha was staring at her phone as if it would do tricks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHoney, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs going to respond,‚Äù Wanda looked at her like she was delivering horrible news.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chewed on her thumb. ‚ÄúI fucked up.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou did,‚Äù Nat agreed. ‚ÄúBut in your defense, something had to give, and no one was talking.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda cut her eyes to Nat and back to Agatha. ‚ÄúNat is‚Ä¶partially right. You two have to talk, and soon, now. You have now pulled back the curtain and know what‚Äôs there.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFireworks,‚Äù Agatha interrupted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll talk about all that in a moment,‚Äù Wanda continued, ‚ÄúNow you two know that for anything to continue, you have to talk. It‚Äôs time. You can‚Äôt go back. You can‚Äôt just push that aside.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know, it‚Äôs just, what if she doesn‚Äôt like what she sees. We can‚Äôt go back, and I can‚Äôt take back that kiss. What do I do then? Say, sorry, I shoved my tongue down your throat? That was the best kiss of my life, and we KNOW what that means, but let‚Äôs just go back to being friends?‚Äù Agatha threw both hands in the air, her fingers spread out towards the ceiling, a questioning look on her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre going back in circles and beating a dead horse. AGATHA! You won‚Äôt know until you talk to her!‚Äù Wanda grabbed her by her shoulders and shook her a little while Nat huffed a laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha dropped her arms. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you two are taking this seriously.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked at her, ‚ÄúAggie, we are. Trust me. You have been there for us for the past 25 years as we‚Äôve navigated our own mess, and we will be here for you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow will I talk to Rio if she won‚Äôt respond?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe football game tomorrow!‚Äù Wanda suddenly remembered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, let me have a heart-to-heart with my son‚Äôs TEACHER at the high school football game,‚Äù Agatha said sarcastically, ‚ÄúI am sure she will be totally comfortable baring her soul in front of the whole school. Afterward, we could all go get ice cream.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôd go get ice cream.‚Äù Nat mocked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, just, please, don‚Äôt fuck it up again. I know you hate talking about your feelings and opening up, but you have to tell her everything. Not the vague story like you told us, everything. You don‚Äôt have to tell her who it was, just lay your heart bare and let her heal it.‚Äù Wanda looked at her pleadingly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was picking at loose threads on her yoga pants and just nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI really thought I‚Äôd be mad at her for running, but I‚Äôm not. I can‚Äôt be. I respect her too much, and, I just, if we end up not working out and remain friends forever, that‚Äôs fine.‚Äù A tear rolled down Agatha‚Äôs cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat just shook her head. ‚ÄúSpoken like a true overdramatic lesbian.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda rolled her eyes, ‚ÄúI know that you‚Äôre worried about losing the friendship aspect of all this, but Agatha, that woman is as down bad for you as you are for her. Neither of you will run.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at them both as she wiped the tears from her eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to tell her why I don‚Äôt date teachers, and why I don‚Äôt do relationships‚Ä¶she doesn‚Äôt need to know I was ever in love. Only three people know about that. The two of you, vaguely, and the woman I loved. She and I can discuss that part later.‚Äù She spoke calmly, mind made up. The truth about her tragic love life was quite awful, and she didn‚Äôt think Rio was ready for that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda put her hand over her eyes and groaned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to blow up in your face later, dumbass.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat put a comforting hand on her unofficial girlfriend‚Äôs back, ‚ÄúIt will, but we‚Äôll be here to help them both because we are gluttons for punishment.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled, ‚ÄúThank you both for your service. In the meantime, why won‚Äôt she answer?‚Äù She pouted, still staring at her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBecause she‚Äôs scared, if it was the best kiss of YOUR life, you whore,‚Äù Wanda said with love, ‚Äúthen it probably was for her too. Was it really fireworks?‚Äù She perked up, wanting details.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes at the name-calling, she had zero shame about her past, ‚ÄúGod, yes. Do you know how terrifying that is?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Nat and Wanda said simultaneously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course you two do, but you ended up together,‚Äù Agatha pointed out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, but I didn‚Äôt always know we would,‚Äù Wanda pointed out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat if we don‚Äôt?‚Äù Agatha frowned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked at her seriously, ‚ÄúHow do you know if you don‚Äôt try?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>

<span>
      SHIELD hadn‚Äôt reached the playoffs in years, and Lilia Calderu was extremely proud of her school full of nepo babies and kids born with silver spoons in their mouths. Her kids worked hard, practiced hard, played hard, and were dedicated.¬† They deserved this just as much as any other school in the Trinity League. Of course, with the NDAs in place and the secrecy that shrouded the school she ran, the media was extremely unhappy as they were only being allowed to cover the very basics of the game. If SHIELD did make the finals, there would be negotiating with lawyers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The coven sat in the bleachers as they always did, cheering on Nicky, and now Tommy and Eddie who had both been moved to the varsity team to cover injuries. Billy still wouldn‚Äôt admit that he and Eddie were dating and just turned red when anyone insinuated as much. While Rio usually sat next to Agatha, she was not sure what to do or say about the kiss the night before. Knowing that a high school football game was not the place for it, Rio did her best to distance herself from Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hadn‚Äôt felt this awkward at a football game since high school when she had been caught making out with Sabrina Spellman, the quarterback‚Äôs girlfriend, underneath the bleachers. Maybe she needed to swear off alcohol AND women.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice leaned into her friend, ‚ÄúMaybe you should talk to her after the game?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, thanks.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was in agony. She was trying to watch her son as he was completing his passes, making touchdowns, running in a touchdown, and generally getting the job done. However, she kept looking at the raven-haired woman a row below her who had constantly been on her mind since they had met at the end of July. Why was this so hard? She turned to Wanda. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going out tonight.‚Äù She said decisively.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a terrible idea,‚Äù Wanda shook her head. Nothing good could come from this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm going, with or without you,‚Äù Agatha tapped Jen‚Äôs shoulder in the row below her. ‚ÄúHey, after the game, we‚Äôre going out. Let Alice and Rio know.‚Äù She straightened back up as the other team scored.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      SHIELD won, advancing to the next round that would take place the following week. The boys were going to a celebratory party, and Vision had volunteered to be one of the parent chaperones. Rio had decided to skip going out with the coven, though everyone else had decided to go, even if just to keep an eye on Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was another exclusive club. Agatha didn‚Äôt like to risk paparazzi and bad publicity, for which Jen was eternally grateful. Wanda was concerned. Agatha normally didn‚Äôt allow herself to get too drunk in public, yet here she was, ten drinks in, no end in sight, and her four babysitters kept losing track of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDo NOT let her make out with or sneak off with anyone!‚Äù Wanda instructed. Nat was on security detail, and she couldn‚Äôt even keep track of Agatha. Alice was looking around the crowded club, eyes wide.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhere did she go?‚Äù She asked Wanda, eyes wide, with panic in her voice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs being stupid and self-destructive,‚Äù Wanda replied knowingly. ‚ÄúIf you see a crowd forming, check it. She‚Äôll most likely be in the middle, controlling all of the women around her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen was worried for other reasons, ‚ÄúIf anyone pulls out a phone that they didn‚Äôt check in, take it. Not everyone follows the rules,‚Äù She instructed, knowing good and well that Agatha was one who did not follow the rules.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had split up to track down the drunken disaster. Agatha, however, was in the middle of the dancefloor having a great time. She was dancing with two women she knew, both actresses' though their faces were blurring together. She had changed before coming out, wearing some black, sleeveless, faux leather number. She was numb from alcohol, having lost count of how much she had had to drink, a feat for her, really, and was ready to revert to her old ways. Agatha had her choice of women and was surveying her choices when a woman she didn‚Äôt know cut in and started to take Agatha‚Äôs attention and took her from everyone else. The woman was gorgeous, with long wavy blonde hair, blue-green eyes, mid-40s if Agatha had to guess. She was dancing suggestively against Agatha, and as far gone as Agatha was, she had lost all control and inhibition. She vaguely remembered being pulled to a dark corner, a mouth pressed to hers, a flash, and something slipped in and out of her pocket, when a familiar redhead pulled them apart ‚ÄúI am so sorry honey, but she is spoken for,‚Äù Wanda told the other woman as she pried Agatha away, ‚Äúyou may have better luck with someone else.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned towards Wanda, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you doing?‚Äù She slurred.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúKeeping you from making a huge mistake. C‚Äômon, my toasted friend. We‚Äôre getting you out of here,‚Äù Wanda put her arm around Agatha‚Äôs waist as Nat joined them. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs gather Alice and Jen.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not done,‚Äù Agatha argued as she stumbled into Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, you are. This will just make things worse, especially if you do anything else.‚Äù Wanda and Nat led Agatha to the car, who, surprisingly, didn‚Äôt put up a fight. Wanda looked at Jen and Alice as they approached.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe two of you are going to Jen‚Äôs place tonight,‚Äù she instructed. ‚ÄúRio isn‚Äôt going to have an out. Yes, that‚Äôs where this one is going,‚Äù Agatha was already in the back of the SUV.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good idea,‚Äù Jen agreed. ‚ÄúTake the highly vulnerable drunk to Rio‚Äôs. Let her sober up there. One of them will confess something.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They went their separate ways as Wanda and Nat headed towards Rio‚Äôs, with Agatha moaning about how much she had messed up. She hadn‚Äôt realized where they were going until they stood at Rio‚Äôs door. Nat had Agatha‚Äôs go bag on one shoulder, and they were both holding her up. Wanda knocked as a courtesy, though she had the spare key Alice had given her just in case.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was not expecting anyone. It was almost midnight, and she and Raven had just finished a bowl of ice cream while they watched Agatha Harkness movies so Rio could torture herself. She was wearing old threadbare pajamas and almost shut the door when she saw a drunk Agatha being supported by the two redheads.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis belongs to you,‚Äù Wanda said, pushing their way in before Rio could slam the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe does not,‚Äù Rio replied, much quieter than she meant. Those were not the words she thought Wanda would say, and she wanted them to be true.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt belong to anybody,‚Äù Agatha proclaimed, stumbling onto the couch, ‚ÄúWell, except the Mouse,‚Äù she added, giggling after remembering the Marvel and Disney contracts she had recently signed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat patted her on the shoulder. ‚ÄúOf course, honey. You‚Äôre going to stay with Rio. Nicky is with Vision, okay?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded as Wanda handed her water.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda turned back to Rio. ‚ÄúLook, she doesn‚Äôt get this drunk, especially in public. Even if you have to wait until morning, just talk, please,‚Äù Wanda hugged her, kissed Agatha on the head, grabbed Nat‚Äôs hand, and left, giving them a meaningful look before closing the door behind them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned back to Agatha, who was eyeing her from the couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey, hot stuff, did I leave the oven on, or is it just you?‚Äù Agatha said playfully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes as she grabbed Agatha‚Äôs bag and found pajamas, ‚ÄúCan you change yourself?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather you strip me down. This dress would look great on your bedroom floor.‚Äù She replied, trying her best to be seductive.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had to bite back a laugh. ‚ÄúJust like you, Harkness, I would not take advantage of you. I am a lady.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tried to be serious, ‚ÄúNo one has ever accused me of being a lady, and you would not be taking advantage, trust me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio blushed, ‚ÄúWhile I am flattered by the drunken admission, you can‚Äôt consent when you‚Äôre drunk. I won‚Äôt accept it. Back to the original question, are you stable enough to change yourself?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even in her hazy state, Agatha knew Rio was right. ‚ÄúCan you unzip me first?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded and unzipped the dress, admiring Agatha‚Äôs toned back as she stumbled off towards the bathroom. Rio had to admit. The dress would have looked great on her floor, flung over a chair, the couch‚Ä¶wherever it had landed. She did follow Agatha at a distance, just in case. Agatha stumbled out of the bathroom a few minutes later. Rio was impressed that her pajamas were on correctly and that she hadn‚Äôt fallen over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAlright Blitzen, let‚Äôs get you to the bed where you‚Äôre safe.‚Äù Rio guided her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had already decided that Agatha was taking the bed and she would take the couch. As much as it pained Rio to sleep in the same place and not sleep next to Agatha, she didn‚Äôt trust either of them. As it was, she wanted to feel Agatha‚Äôs lips on hers again, but this was not the time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOoh, you are taking me to bed!‚Äù Agatha grinned, as Rio tucked her in. ‚ÄúWait, are you not sleeping with me?‚Äù Agatha looked at her, confused and hurt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave her a small smile and sat on the bed facing Agatha,, before caressing her cheek with the back of her hand. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm going to take the couch. I don‚Äôt think this is the best time to sleep next to you. Based on our kiss last night, there‚Äôs something here, and we need to talk before anything else happens.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had wrapped a hand around Rio‚Äôs wrist, holding her hand in place as she leaned into the touch. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk now.‚Äù Her eyelids were heavy, and she looked up at Rio through her eyelashes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at her softly, ‚ÄúWould you remember in the morning? Or stay awake for the entire discussion?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha yawned. ‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWill you stay until I fall asleep?‚Äù Agatha asked. She had let go of Rio‚Äôs wrist and removed Rio‚Äôs hand from her cheek, opting to hold it, intertwining their fingers instead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. Agatha was vulnerable when she was drunk. It was much different than what she was used to. Rio moved to sit next to Agatha, back against the headboard and played with her hair in the way she knew Agatha liked. Agatha sighed with contentment as the alcohol overtook her body.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, why did you decide to go out and drink tonight?‚Äù Rio asked, chewing on her lip. If she was going to get an honest answer, it was now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMad at myself. Thought I‚Äôd lost you,‚Äù Agatha replied, voice laced with sleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew the answer to her next question but needed it confirmed. She knew she was technically taking advantage of Agatha, but also knew that this was the master of deflection, and this was the best time to get around that. ‚ÄúAggie, when was the last time you slept with someone?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nuzzled against Rio‚Äôs thigh. ‚ÄúTwo days before I met you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only one I‚Äôve wanted since the day I met you at SHIELD.‚Äù Her voice had started to trail off as she quickly lost her fight to stay awake.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat there, running her fingers through Agatha‚Äôs hair as she slept. She knew it was time to tell her everything in the morning. If Agatha rejected her because of her past and the danger it posed, then, she rejected her. But she had to come clean finally. Rio leaned over and kissed Agatha on the forehead, second-guessing her decision to sleep on the couch before she reminded herself it was the right thing to do. She grabbed a pillow and a blanket from the closet before deciding to sleep on a makeshift bed on the floor instead, to at least be close to Agatha. Raven, the traitor, slept with Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha woke up in the morning a bit hazy but fine. She rarely got hangovers, a superpower from her years of heavy drinking. She heard purring in her ear and turned to see Raven curled up next to her head. ‚ÄúYou are not the woman of the house I wanted to see first thing this morning,‚Äù She said as she scratched the feline on the head. She looked around to see her bag on top of the dresser and smiled at how thoughtful Rio had been. She followed her normal morning routine, put on sweats and a SHIELD football shirt that had been in her bag, and left her hair down. She wouldn‚Äôt make this morning awkward and barely remembered what she had said to Rio last night. She was determined to have that overdue conversation this morning. She could smell coffee and food and walked towards the kitchen to see Rio putting bacon and eggs on a second plate.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned against the door frame and smiled as she imagined cooking together in her kitchen at the compound. ‚ÄúYou took care of my drunk ass, and now you‚Äôre making me breakfast?‚Äù She had one eyebrow raised and her arms crossed over her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed as she turned around, handing her a plate. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve gotta make sure you're sober before we talk. We‚Äôre eating in the living room. Coffee is already there.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They both sat on the couch, facing each other. Raven jumped up between them as Rio looked at her, ‚ÄúBacon is in your bowl, Your Majesty,‚Äù Raven meowed her thanks and hopped back down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed, ‚ÄúI still think it‚Äôs funny that she eats the way she does.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve tried telling her no before. You know how insistent she is.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had indeed learned how insistent the immortal cat was. She would use her paw and snatch what she wanted. When you were as old as Raven was, you got to do what you wanted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Agatha. ‚ÄúBefore I share anything with you, you have to know that if anything happens between us, Raven comes first. She is my second longest relationship, after Alice,‚Äù she said seriously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. ‚ÄúGot it. I feel Raven could murder me in my sleep, so that‚Äôs fine.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had already finished her breakfast and set her plate down, taking a deep breath. ‚ÄúRemember how I told Wanda I moved out here for a fresh start and to be near Alice or whatever bullshit?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hadn‚Äôt forgotten anything from that day. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, it was partially true. I mainly left San Francisco because of a woman. My main rule for not dating parents is because I did date a parent, and it ended badly.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow badly?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI ended up in the hospital and almost died,‚Äù Rio waited for Agatha‚Äôs reaction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had to make herself breathe normally. She wanted to know who the bitch was and make sure they could never hurt Rio again. ‚ÄúRio, what happened?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took a deep breath, ‚ÄúRoughly three years ago, I had a very sweet student that I noticed right off the bat needed to be in advanced classes. I met her mom at an open house a few weeks after school started. The mom and I hit it off automatically and became friends. We‚Äôre just going to call her SF for San Francisco. She‚Äôs kind of famous. She was having problems in her marriage and opened up to me about it. Hubby is very famous. I‚Äôm not saying what he does. I did sign an NDA. SF had everyone around her sign NDAs, as she‚Äôs very paranoid. Anyway, I was under the impression that hubby was out of the picture and they were getting a divorce, or else we never would have dated, and we dated for twoish years, off and on. I knew that she would never be public with me., She would always be closeted, for her career, and I was okay with that,‚Äù Rio paused and looked at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took Rio‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúI would never want to hide you, Rio. I can‚Äôt imagine how you felt when Wan..‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Rio interrupted, ‚ÄúThat was not the same. I honestly thought the husband was completely out of the picture. Wanda has always been completely honest with Nat. Wanda Maximoff had zero nefarious reasons for what she did. SF is a sociopath. Natasha Romanov is one of the most patient and amazing humans I know who never gave up on the woman she loves. I was an idiot that ignored a lot of red flags.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head, ‚ÄúI was going to say, ‚ÄòWhen Wanda had a similar story that turned out to have a happy ending.‚Äô‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just blushed. ‚ÄúSorry, I jumped to conclusions. Anyway, after two years of on-again, off-again, and hubby coming in and out of the picture, I ended things for good. She started to stalk me, and I had to get a restraining order on a parent. A famous one at that, which was hard to do, and the school tried to fire me. The union had to get involved. It was extremely messy. The order is only temporary because the judge is a fan of theirs. That was last March. Well, when the restraining order was filed and served, the husband found out. I was out for a run one weekend, and I was tackled out of nowhere,‚Äù Rio stopped and looked away. She had started breathing rapidly, the anxiety filling her with a sense of dread. She wasn‚Äôt sure she could handle this. But, she was almost to the finish line, but she wasn‚Äôt sure if she could tell Agatha the rest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha saw that Rio was starting to panic. She took both of Rio‚Äôs hands and pulled her closer to her. ‚ÄúRio,‚Äù she whispered, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to scare me away. You don‚Äôt have to finish the rest if you aren‚Äôt ready, okay, sweetie?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She moved her hands to cradle Rio‚Äôs face, looking into her eyes with concern, care, and something else Rio couldn't quite place.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI understand why dating parents, or anyone, would scare you, but I want you, all of you. I will face anything with you, no matter what it is.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wanted to melt into Agatha right then. Agatha Fucking Harkness wanted her: Rio Vidal, ordinary human, teacher, sixteen years Agatha‚Äôs junior, crazy cat lady, as damaged as she was. This amazing, beautiful goddess of a person that she had somehow automatically befriended three months ago was here, on her couch, willing to take on her darkest secrets because she wanted Rio. Rio searched Agatha‚Äôs eyes, looking for any hint of doubt, anything that meant she might not want to do this, and found none.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù Rio nodded, tears falling down her cheeks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to just show you, though.‚Äù Rio moved back, and Agatha‚Äôs hands fell from Rio‚Äôs face. Rio picked up her phone, opened up her photos, and scrolled back to the spring, before finding the pictures of her in the hospital. She sighed as she handed the device to Agatha, ‚ÄúI wish I could say it looks worse than it was, but‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off as Agatha raised the phone and scrolled through the pictures. Rio watched her reactions closely as Agatha gasped at what she saw. Rio‚Äôs black eye and swollen jaw, throat red from where he had attempted to strangle her. The black, blue, and purple bruises that had blossomed over her left side from shoulder to hip. The stitches over her ribcage from the stab wounds there. Agatha looked up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you in a bikini. Why didn‚Äôt I see the scars?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged, ‚ÄúYou have to look closely. They blend in. They‚Äôve also faded over the months.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked back, scrapes and cuts on her right side from where she had skidded on the pavement. ‚ÄúAny internal injuries?‚Äù She asked quietly, tears falling from her own eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúA few, nothing major. Lost my appendix somehow. Still not sure how that correlated.‚Äù She scoffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why Alice left so abruptly. She said there was an emergency and wouldn‚Äôt let any of us come. Nat asked if it was her type of emergency, but she wouldn‚Äôt say anything.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚ÄúA day later,¬† Lilia showed up at Alice‚Äôs request. It‚Äôs when I got the offer to come here.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course, Alice did, to make sure you‚Äôre safe because you‚Äôre important to Alice.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave her a soft smile as she put down the phone. She reached up and lightly ran her fingertips over Rio‚Äôs face where the bruises had been as if trying to heal the memories themselves. Agatha trailed her fingers down Rio‚Äôs neck and then lightly down the sides of her body over her clothes, careful not to put too much pressure, as if the bruises and cuts were still there. Agatha never broke eye contact as she took Rio in, trying her best to soothe the memories of what had happened all those months ago. She reached Rio‚Äôs knees and ran her hands back up to Rio‚Äôs shoulders slowly. Rio‚Äôs eyes fluttered closed as she gasped lightly from the contact. Agatha ran her hands down Rio‚Äôs side one more time before she rested them on Rio‚Äôs knees. She didn‚Äôt need to explain anything. Rio knew Agatha was trying to replace and erase the memory, as well as make sure she was really here, ‚ÄúI wish I could say I can‚Äôt believe he got away with it, but, well‚Ä¶‚Äù she trailed off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just looked at her breathlessly. Agatha had just barely touched her, and she felt as if her soul had left her body. Agatha had tried to replace her memories in a way only Agatha Harkness could, tears slowly rolling down both of their cheeks as Rio continued their conversation. ‚ÄúYes, well. He did. I finished the school year and moved out here right before school started. I had to wait until I was well enough to move. I had a few cracked ribs that took a little while to heal and a concussion from where my head hit the pavement. They basically bribed me to stay quiet, on top of the NDA,‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was picking at her sweats. Agatha wiped Rio‚Äôs tears away and turned her face to look at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, I understand, and I will never intentionally hurt you. We can go as slowly as you want, but none of that was your fault.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, there‚Äôs something else.‚Äù Rio worried at her lip. Afraid that this would be the thing that drove Agatha away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe, SF, has a history of stalking. She‚Äôs insane. Our photos have been everywhere. She knows‚Ä¶‚Äù Rio rambled, not able to actually tell Agatha that SF had contacted her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. ‚ÄúHoney. I‚Äôve been stalked before. It comes with the territory. I have a security team. I have a Natasha. We will all be okay. WE are safe. YOU are safe. NICKY is safe. I will make sure of it. We all will.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She leaned forward and pressed their foreheads together, reveling in the touch and closeness. They were so close to actually starting something, and Agatha could feel it in her bones.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre okay with all this?‚Äù Rio asked. ‚ÄúCrazy stalker ex and‚Ä¶ me? Rio felt like she was naked before Agatha, all the parts of her exposed and visible. She needed to be sure that Agatha truly understood and was clear that she accepted all of Rio and everything that came with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, Rio.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù This time, it was Rio who kissed Agatha. In it, she conveyed a simple message, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm yours.‚Äù It was lighter and shorter than either of them would have liked, but it was Rio‚Äôs way of ending her side of this conversation. As she pulled away from Agatha, she brushed a strand of Agatha‚Äôs hair behind her ear. ‚ÄúI love your hair and could play with it for hours,‚Äù she mused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed.‚Äù Her eyes looked behind Rio to the green eyes that were glaring at her. ‚ÄúUm, how well does Raven share? I feel like she‚Äôs plotting my demise.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio grinned. ‚ÄúShe does not, and she probably is.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen, before we continue this conversation, it‚Äôs Saturday. Want to go ahead and move this to my house?‚Äù She kept her eyes on the cat that now looked at her like she was telepathically giving her the rules for dating Rio, and they all ended with death.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just laughed, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre afraid of Raven, but yes, let me grab a bag and text Alice to feed her before she comes to the compound.‚Äù She said as she went to her room to grab a few things.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat is not your average housecat, and why don‚Äôt you just leave food down for her?‚Äù Agatha called towards the bedroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow dare you insult her like that! Have you not noticed she eats a very delicate mix of wet and dry food? How dare you not know what my cat eats!‚Äù Rio called back, trying her hardest to sound offended.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha made eye contact with Raven and whispered, ‚ÄúIf I buy you a fancy wet food auto feeder, will you like me and put in a good word to your human for me?‚Äù Raven meowed and stretched before pawing at Agatha‚Äôs nose. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take that as a strong maybe.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio drove them to the compound, holding Agatha‚Äôs hand the entire time. They talked about the next football game and what movies they thought Wanda and Nat would choose to watch that night. Rio felt so much better having her stalker past off her chest, even if she hadn‚Äôt shared the current situation. Agatha was right. SF couldn‚Äôt do anything, not with the whole security team around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they got to the house, Agatha was starting to get nervous. How much did she want to tell Rio? She knew she would eventually share everything, but she should probably do like she told Nat and Wanda and only share part of it. She took both of their duffel bags upstairs and tossed them in her room before coming downstairs. In the span of five minutes, all three boys had appeared and were talking to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey Mom! Rio reminded us we have a test on Monday. Please tell her that we should be exempt because we won a playoff game,‚Äù Nicky teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFor that, she should give you a test and a pop quiz,‚Äù Agatha shot back as she walked to the kitchen to grab something for lunch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAunt Aggie, I heard a rumor‚Ä¶‚Äù Tommy started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFinish that sentence, and I‚Äôll cut out your tongue,‚Äù Agatha said from the kitchen as she put leftover vegetable lo mein Rio had made the other night in the microwave.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSuch violence,‚Äù Rio giggled. ‚ÄúBilly, how‚Äôs Eddie?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy blushed, ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù he mumbled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Tommy and Nicky continued to go back and forth with Agatha, Rio put her hand on Billy‚Äôs arm and spoke quietly. ‚ÄúHey, if you ever want to talk to me, you can, okay? You‚Äôre surrounded by lesbians. You don‚Äôt have to hide anything.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy shrugged. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt I though? Mom and Aunt Nat have hidden for how long now? I know they think we don‚Äôt know, but we do. We‚Äôve known forever. Mom and Dad have pretended to be this perfect couple our whole lives like we don‚Äôt have eyes.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was trying her best to remain neutral. ‚ÄúHow do you feel about that?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He sighed, ‚ÄúTommy and I want all of them to be happy. We wouldn‚Äôt be upset if they divorced. Dad deserves to find someone, and Mom and Aunt Nat deserve to be together. We found some really old pictures of them together. Printed ones from the late 1900‚Äôs!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stifled a laugh. ‚ÄúBilly, I think you and Tommy need to talk with your parents.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He nodded. ‚ÄúThree out of the four. Aunt Aggie can sit this one out. Thank you, Rio. I hope you and Aunt Aggie work out.‚Äù He hugged her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey, Billy, are you done talking to my future stepmom? We‚Äôre going to the clubhouse. Oh, Rio, should I call you bonus mom, or are you more of a stepdad?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNICHOLAS!‚Äù Agatha yelled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBYE!‚Äù All three boys shouted as they ran out of the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had collapsed onto the couch laughing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha brought their lunch and water and set it down, looking at the younger woman. ‚ÄúI apologize for that child of mine.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, ‚ÄòStepdaddy Rio‚Äô has a nice ring to it,‚Äù She teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      On the inside, Agatha was panicking but appeared calm on the exterior as she smiled and kissed Rio on the cheek, close to the corner of her mouth. The mention of anything related to marriage scared her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio ate quickly before filling Agatha in on what Billy said. Agatha nodded. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll let the redheaded wonders know, and they can have that discussion with the twins. This means Nicky knows too, and we‚Äôll talk to Nicky about us once we decide what we are.‚Äù Agatha said, locking eyes with Rio. Rio nodded, taking their empty dishes to the kitchen and loading them in the dishwasher before returning. She sat, turned towards Agatha, and took her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTalk to me, Aggie. I showed you mine. Show me yours.‚Äù She kissed the back of Agatha‚Äôs hand as she gazed into the blue eyes that had begun to feel like home, propped her elbow on the back of the couch, and placed her cheek on her fist.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was Agatha‚Äôs turn to take a deep breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay, first, my no-teacher rule, which is newer. So, it‚Äôs no secret that Lilia lets me do whatever I want. I‚Äôm a big donor to the school, and my son is the star quarterback. Well, with my previous reputation being what it was, I had my fun with every somewhat single sapphic teacher, and some not so single or sapphic for at least a few hours, teachers. It caused a lot of drama.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not surprised,‚Äù Rio said dryly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo one was. Since I was the one that brought Alice out here, and I was a good friend of her mom‚Äôs, that never happened. Just so you know,‚Äù Agatha reassured her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it had,‚Äù Rio had never even questioned it once.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo, I swore off any more people at SHIELD. Lilia was very grateful for that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat up. ‚ÄúLilia is somewhat encouraging of this, though,‚Äù She gestured between them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled, ‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôll encourage something if SHE thinks it‚Äôs right. That‚Äôs Lilia Calderu for you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just shook her head. That sounded like the Lilia she had gotten to know. ‚ÄúOkay, and the Nicky of that equation?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAs long as he doesn‚Äôt try to get special treatment, it‚Äôs fine,‚Äù Agatha assured.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen, the big question, Agatha Harkness, is why don‚Äôt you do relationships?‚Äù Rio looked at her softly, awaiting the answer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay, but remember, you asked,‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs mind raced as she considered exactly how much she would share. Rio had shared so much, but Agatha didn‚Äôt want to put too much on her. ‚ÄúThis life is a lot, and it‚Äôs a lot to ask of anyone to take on. Filming schedules, my traveling. You‚Äôve only gotten a small taste of it. Not to mention constant speculation, harassment online, just everything that goes along with this much fame. It‚Äôs a lot of pressure. It‚Äôs a lot to ask of someone else to endure with me. You‚Äôre used to NDAs at this point, and not being able to share everything, so that‚Äôs helpful. There will be times when we don‚Äôt see each other for months at a time, and every time I am pictured with another woman, rumors will fly.‚Äù She was drawing from experience, from things that had happened the last time she was with someone. The constant arguing, the accusations.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took Agatha‚Äôs hand in hers. ‚ÄúRemember what I told you when we were preparing for the premiere? I can handle anything with you next to me. I meant that, Agatha. We have circled this thing between us for months now, and I know we‚Äôre afraid something will happen and affect our friendship, but I think we need to try.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wanted this, she wasn‚Äôt worried about distance or time spent apart, and she could ignore speculation and the media, couldn‚Äôt she? After all, sometime in the last three months, Agatha had become one of the closest people in her life. The last person she wanted to hear from before she went to sleep at night. The person she looked forward to seeing every weekend, the arms she woke up in most Sunday mornings. This felt right, and she needed to see where it would lead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled. She knew she should tell Rio the rest, but Rio hadn‚Äôt pushed, so she wasn‚Äôt going to say anything either. It‚Äôs not like they were in love, and if those feelings came up, then she would potentially cross that bridge. Agatha wasn‚Äôt even sure if she was capable of that anymore. She knew she cared for Rio in a way that scared her, but she wasn‚Äôt in love with her, right?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI guess now we decide where we want to go from here. I don‚Äôt expect you to jump into anything, and I want to move at a pace you‚Äôre comfortable with.‚Äù Agatha said looking into Rio‚Äôs eyes, and saw the slightest hint of fear and hesitation. She knew Rio was still¬† nervous.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI trust you, Agatha, I do, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have the best track record.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs putting it mildly.‚ÄùRio grimaced. SF wasn‚Äôt the only person she had dated, however, none of her relationships had ended particularly well. ‚ÄúI want you, Agatha, not like a friend either. You‚Äôre right that I don‚Äôt want to jump into anything.‚Äù She had looked away and was rubbing her chest trying to calm herself down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha used two fingers to tip Rio‚Äôs chin and turn it towards her. ‚ÄúCan I take you on an actual date? Next Saturday?‚Äù Agatha asked softly.
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
      Electricity was shooting through Rio, and part of her was ready to say fuck it and beg Agatha to take her to bed, but Rio knew she wasn‚Äôt ready for that, no matter how much she wanted to or had fantasized about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHave you ever been on a date?‚Äù Rio asked as she raised an eyebrow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI might be a bit rusty, but I think I can manage.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll miss movie night‚Ä¶‚Äù Rio stalled with a slight smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWill you please answer me and put me out of my misery?‚Äù Agatha slid her hand around to rest behind Rio‚Äôs neck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Rio brought her hands up and ran them through Agatha‚Äôs hair as Agatha moaned lightly at the touch. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt kiss me right now, I might implode.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha used her grip on the back of Rio‚Äôs neck to pull her towards her as Agatha surged forward to meet Rio‚Äôs lips with her own. Rio sighed into Agatha‚Äôs mouth as their lips met. The kiss was slow, passionate, and exploratory. Hands in hair and light caresses, tongues intertwining.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was relieved to see Rio‚Äôs black Grand Cherokee in front of Agatha‚Äôs house. ‚ÄúOh good, she didn‚Äôt kick Agatha out. She brought her home.‚Äù She said to Nat, as they walked towards the front door, holding hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHopefully, they finally talked and are getting somewhere,‚Äù Nat said as they walked in the door and to the living room where they froze as Agatha and Rio kissed on the couch before them. Wanda‚Äôs hands flew up to her face as she squealed. ‚ÄúThey got somewhere all right,‚Äù Nat smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned bright red as she broke their kiss, looking down. ‚ÄúUmm, hi,‚Äù She said breathlessly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her hair back and turned towards the very unwelcome intruders. ‚ÄúAre we going to have to start putting a sock on the door?‚Äù She asked with a sarcastic smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI recall there‚Äôs an entire scrunchie system,‚Äù Nat offered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this about scrunchies?‚Äù Jen asked as she and Alice came in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThinking about ways to do your hair when it finally grows back,‚Äù Agatha grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked at how Rio and Agatha were still sitting facing each other, Rio with an arm on Agatha‚Äôs shoulder, playing with her hair. Agatha‚Äôs hand on Rio‚Äôs thigh, knees pressed together. Wanda and Nat were facing the couch, and Wanda‚Äôs pupils were dilated like she‚Äôd seen a ghost‚Ä¶ or her sister making out with one of her best friends.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha and Rio were making out!‚Äù Alice suddenly exclaimed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio groaned, ‚ÄúA little louder, Alice. I don‚Äôt think they heard you in Mexico.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda finally regained her ability to function, ‚ÄúSo, is this happening?? Did you talk? Tell us everything!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Everyone took their normal positions and focused on Agatha and Rio. Rio was bright red and nudged Agatha to adjust how they were sitting to face their friends more comfortably. Agatha smiled and got the hint. She knew Rio wanted to lean on Agatha right now, not wanting to be the main focus. She turned, facing forward, propping her legs up on the coffee table. She put her arm around Rio as Rio laid her head on Agatha‚Äôs shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe are going on a date Saturday if you must know. And yes, we‚Äôve talked. You‚Äôre all nosey.‚Äù Agatha recapped.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda narrowed her eyes. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all we‚Äôre getting, Harkness?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFor now, yes, because you and Nat are needed at your house. The twins need to talk with the two of you and your husband,‚Äù Agatha looked at both of them softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The color drained from both redhead‚Äôs faces, as Jen‚Äôs eyes went wide as she looked at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDo I need to prepare a statement now?‚Äù Jen looked between Agatha and Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda just looked at Agatha, waiting for her to continue, but it was Rio that spoke.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI asked Billy why he wouldn‚Äôt tell us about him and Eddie. I told him he didn‚Äôt have to hide. He said that you, Wanda, and Nat have hidden his whole life, so why shouldn‚Äôt he? He and Tommy know. They have known, for as long as either of them can remember, they‚Äôve known. They aren‚Äôt mad at any of you. They want the three of you to be happy, but they want to sit down and talk to ‚Äòthree of their four parents‚Äô.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was Rio‚Äôs turn to look softly at Wanda and Nat, and both women were trying to hold back tears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDamn my sons for being empaths,‚Äù Wanda whispered as Nat squeezed her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at Jen, ‚ÄúAs far as damage control goes, I say we still wait to say anything publicly until after the holidays, calm before the storm and all. Let us all adjust before everyone is calling for interviews and statements. Our family will not be dealing with that over the holidays,‚Äù She stated with finality. Agatha was the matriarch of this coven and found family, and they were thankful for it. She looked over at Wanda and Nat. ‚ÄúNow, go get your asses handed to you by two of our boys.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they left, Jen turned towards her other potential PR nightmare, ‚ÄúAny statements about the two of you?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at Rio, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to you, as fast or slow as you want.‚Äù She said as she squeezed Rio‚Äôs hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled at her before turning to Jen. ‚ÄúNothing yet. We‚Äôre going on a first date next weekend, and if people take pictures and speculate, let them. We‚Äôre not together, officially, so no need to make any statements.‚Äù She felt wrong saying it, but she also knew it was the right approach.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice and Jen both caught the flash of hurt across Agatha‚Äôs face, but didn‚Äôt acknowledge it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was then that Agatha Fucking Harkness vowed to woo over Rio Fucking Vidal if it was the last thing she did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tommy and Billy Maximoff had made their parents, and Aunt Nat sit on the couch as they sat on the one to the side. They looked like two fathers who were very disappointed in their three teenage children. Billy, being the more well-spoken of the two, started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Aunt Aggie and Rio filled you in a bit,‚Äù he started. The three adults nodded as he continued. ‚ÄúWe found some very old photos a year or so ago that only confirmed what we already knew, and have known, for as long as we remember.‚Äù He handed the pictures over to his Mom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took the pictures, and the other two adults leaned over to look. Wanda held a picture of her and Nat. Nat was standing behind a smiling Wanda, arms wrapped around Wanda‚Äôs waist, kissing her on the cheek, ‚ÄúWe were maybe 20 here. This is before I met your father. Your aunt and I had just started dating, and we were at a party that Aunt Aggie was throwing for some show or movie.‚Äù She flipped to the next picture, all three women, Nat and Wanda were looking at each other like they were the only two people in the world who existed, and Agatha was making a gagging motion.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgain, before I met your father, a house party at another actor‚Äôs house,‚Äù Another picture, this one of Wanda and Nat kissing. Both women turned bright red, ‚ÄúSelf-explanatory.‚Äù The next picture was of her and Vision, when they had announced their engagement. They were both smiling, but hers didn‚Äôt quite meet her eyes and she looked like she would cry. She looked at her husband, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision shook his head, ‚ÄúI knew what I was signing up for, darling,‚Äù He said as he squeezed her knee. If a more understanding and patient man existed in the world, Wanda wasn‚Äôt sure how.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There were two pictures left. One was the leaked picture of her and Nat kissing at The Killers concert. The other was one she remembered well. Agatha had taken it. They had lived in the clubhouse at the time, and she and Nat were sitting on the couch, facing each other, fingers locked together, when their eyes met and Nat had told Wanda that she loved her for the first time. A tear ran down Wanda‚Äôs cheek as she looked at the boys, ‚ÄúThis is the first time your Aunt Nat told me she loved me.‚Äù Nat wiped the tear from Wanda‚Äôs cheek as Vision sniffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy and Tommy nodded. ‚ÄúWhy? Why the secrecy and all this?‚Äù Billy asked. ‚ÄúWe looked up some things online. There are a lot of theories, but we think we deserve to know the truth.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. ‚ÄúYou do.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision looked at the two women next to him and then back to the boys. ‚ÄúWhile this is your mother‚Äôs story to tell, I want you both to know that if anyone is the victim here, it‚Äôs your mother and your aunt. The industry was very cruel and hypocritical. It celebrated Agatha because she came out at a younger age and it added to her persona. I knew all along, and your mother made a very difficult decision. We love each other very much, just in a different way, and everything we‚Äôve done has been for the two of you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys both nodded. Wanda squeezed Vision‚Äôs hand. He really was a great husband and father. She looked at the boys and took a deep breath. ‚ÄúI fell in love with Nat years before I met your father‚Ä¶‚Äù She told them a child-friendly version of the story and brought them up to speed, including how they had decided to divorce and were preparing to tell them after the holidays.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo, you and Aunt Nat have been having an affair for 20 years?‚Äù Tommy asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhile you‚Äôre still 14 and it‚Äôs not your business, no, we have not. Vows have not been broken, well, if kissing isn‚Äôt breaking vows,‚Äù Wanda answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI told your mother she could,‚Äù Vision answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have always respected your parents' marriage,‚Äù Nat added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy grimaced, but he did think it was sweet to a degree. ‚ÄúSo you were planning a divorce but were waiting to tell us?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe wanted to wait until after the holidays. We weren‚Äôt sure how you boys would take it,‚Äù Wanda looked at them both with motherly concern.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDad, you‚Äôre okay with all of this?‚Äù Tommy looked at Vision.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhen you truly love someone, you realize that you want them to be happy. Plus, your mother and I have been best friends for much longer than we‚Äôve been anything else.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo, is everyone okay with this? No hard feelings, no custody battles, and we‚Äôre still going to be a cohesive family. Dad might live somewhere else, and Mom will eventually marry Aunt Nat?‚Äù Tommy looked at all three adults.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù All three answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Both twins grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIn that case, Eddie and I are dating. Moms, dad, I‚Äôm gay.‚Äù Billy announced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo shit, son.‚Äù Nat laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<span>
      The week had gone by quickly, and Agatha would be at Rio‚Äôs door in a few minutes to pick her up. Rio was nervous, though she wasn‚Äôt completely sure as to why. It was Agatha, her friend, her‚Ä¶potential girlfriend? Okay, that was a tad scary, and they would probably be all over Page Six by morning, Twitter, BlueSky, Tumblr‚Ä¶she wasn‚Äôt used to that either. This was LA, celebrities were everywhere, but Agatha Harkness was never seen out on an actual date, and Rio hadn‚Äôt gone out in public with the ex. They knew that even if they didn‚Äôt make a verbal or published statement, they would be making a visual one. It was dinner, and then Agatha had some surprise for her. She wasn‚Äôt sure what they would be doing on the second Saturday night of November, but she was up for anything as long as she was doing it with Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She touched up her dark red lipstick and walked through the apartment into the living room. She wore a long-sleeve green v-cut blouse and black pencil skirt with knee-high black boots, with her hair in large curls around her shoulders, ‚ÄúAlright Raven, here goes everything,‚Äù She said to the sleeping cat on the couch, who barely stirred as there was a knock on the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As often as Rio had seen Agatha in a suit, she still never tired of it. The woman looked stunning in them, and she knew it. This particular suit was black and fitted with a purple vest, no shirt, and purple stiletto heels. Agatha Fucking Harkness, indeed. Rio ran her eyes up and down Agatha twice before she even realized she had one foot propped on a box.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù Rio asked, ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs with the stance there, Captain Morgan?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis,‚Äù Agatha picked up the box and walked dramatically past Rio. ‚ÄúIs for the woman of the house. M‚ÄôLady,‚Äù she presented the box to Raven, who woke up and sniffed at it curiously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio walked over to look at the box herself and laughed. ‚ÄúDid you buy her a fancy automatic feeder for wet food?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, I did. I‚Äôm tired of you running off at the unholy hour of seven in the morning on Sundays, and Alice can‚Äôt always pop over here. Besides, she and Jen will eventually move in together,‚Äù Agatha walked off towards the kitchen to figure out the gadget, Raven on her heels.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt took them nearly a decade to start dating. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll U-Haul it anytime soon. And mighty presumptuous of you to think I‚Äôll still stay the night on Saturdays.‚Äù Rio followed them into the kitchen, ready to watch Agatha set up Raven‚Äôs new contraption.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe start dating and you stop spending the night? Isn‚Äôt that backwards?‚Äù She smirked as she opened and immediately discarded the directions on the counter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes, ‚ÄúWhy does it not surprise me that you don‚Äôt read directions?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt make it this far following the rules, sweetcheeks. Hand me your phone.‚Äù Agatha held her hand out for Rio‚Äôs phone as she plugged in the feeder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not unlocking it for you.‚Äù Rio raised an eyebrow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIs this a test?‚Äù Agatha didn‚Äôt take her eyes off Rio as she unlocked Rio‚Äôs phone and downloaded an app, ‚ÄúYou can control this thing from your phone. Will you hand me Her Highness‚Äôs food, please? I know you already have it portioned and ready to go for the morning.‚Äù She looked down at Raven, who was pawing at Agatha‚Äôs hand as she petted her, ‚ÄúI also know you‚Äôve been fed for the night already, but nice try.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was impressed as she handed Raven‚Äôs breakfast to Agatha. The older woman put the food in the tray, closed the lid, and programmed the time in Rio‚Äôs phone before handing it back to her. ‚ÄúYou can put up to six meals in it. It keeps everything cold and fresh, the app controls everything, or you can program it on here.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was impressed. No one had ever used Raven to their advantage before, and Agatha hadn‚Äôt even read the instructions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou watched a video, didn‚Äôt you, Harkness?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI will never reveal my secrets.‚Äù She stood up in one fluid motion and took Rio‚Äôs hand, kissing its back. ‚ÄúNow that I‚Äôve won Raven over, are you ready to go?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou mean you aren‚Äôt just trying to woo the cat?‚Äù Rio looked at her playfully, ‚ÄúYes, let me grab my bag, and we‚Äôll go.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The restaurant had been one of LA‚Äôs celebrity hotspots, though Rio really didn‚Äôt mind. She liked the atmosphere, the food was great, and she was there with Agatha. That was not the important part of this date, nor was it what she had been looking forward to. It was what came afterward, the surprise that Agatha had been hinting at all week. They were back at the car, and Rio was surprised to see that Agatha‚Äôs driver was not there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWait, Agatha, are YOU driving? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever actually seen you drive.‚Äù Rio said with a mixture of shock and hesitation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio. I am 51 years old. I drive. Get in the car.‚Äù She smiled as she got into the driver‚Äôs seat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôm just not used to it. Why are you driving?‚Äù She asked, eyebrow raised with suspicion. ‚ÄúAre we doing something illegal?‚Äù She buckled her seatbelt, still confused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôd like us to be completely alone? Maybe it‚Äôs a secret. Maybe we‚Äôre going on a bank heist.‚Äù Agatha threw out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were driving up the Pacific Coastal Highway, away from the city, and Rio could see more of the sky and the stars than usual. She reached over and ran her fingers through Agatha‚Äôs hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am trying to focus on driving,‚Äù Agatha said as she reached over with her right hand and placed it on Rio‚Äôs thigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBoth hands on the wheel, Harkness,‚Äù Rio instructed, trying not to smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha ignored her, smirking instead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes, ‚ÄúWhere are you taking me?‚Äù They had exited the highway and were on a dirt road.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSecret lair, very secluded. I plan on seducing and torturing you, might murder you, might not. We‚Äôll see what happens,‚Äù Agatha kept a straight face in the way only she could.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis is why you have so many awards. If I didn‚Äôt know better, I would have believed you. Also, I might be game.‚Äù Rio put her hand on Agatha‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWho said I was acting? We will, however, revisit some of what you‚Äôre game for in the future,‚Äù Agatha cleared her throat, as it was suddenly dry, ‚ÄúOh look, we‚Äôre here.‚Äù Agatha had turned into some type of parking lot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù Rio asked, looking around, confused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou tell me, mad scientist.‚Äù Agatha was practically bouncing from excitement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked around and then looked up at where they could see the sky, free from light pollution before looking back at Agatha. ‚ÄúAggie, what‚Äôs in the back of the car?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI thought you‚Äôd never ask,‚Äù Agatha dramatically flounced to the back of the SUV, opening the back as she went, pulling out a telescope with a shit-eating grin on her face. ‚ÄúI heard you like stars and sciencey shit.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou brought me to a national park, away from everything, with a giant ass telescope, by ourselves, on the night of a meteor shower, for our first date?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI did.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAnd you haven‚Äôt been on a proper date in years?‚Äù At this point, Rio didn‚Äôt understand why Agatha was single.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have not.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio could see the delight in Agatha‚Äôs eyes at her amazement and surprise. She had seen everything Agatha had ever been in and couldn‚Äôt recall a scene like this so she knew that either one of their friends had tipped her off or she really was just this thoughtful. If she wasn‚Äôt already under Agatha‚Äôs spell, she was now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha handed Rio the telescope ‚ÄúI believe this is your department,‚Äù before pulling out a blanket and a tote bag. ‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù She strutted across the uneven ground, still in stilettos in only the way Agatha could.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs eyes dropped to appreciate the view of Agatha in front of her, ‚ÄúGladly.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha led them to a small clearing not far from where they had parked, laying out the blanket, and pulling out two thermos‚Äô of cocoa as Rio set up the telescope and dialed it in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDid you bring hot chocolate, you Girl Scout?‚Äù Rio laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI played a Girl Scout as a kid, and yes I did. It‚Äôs chilly and I‚Äôm driving, celebrities and DUI‚Äôs don‚Äôt mix.‚Äù Agatha handed her a thermos as she joined her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha Harkness, an adorable romantic, who knew?‚Äù Rio noted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm full of surprises.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù She peered through the lenses before standing up and motioning for Agatha to look. ‚ÄúSee those two stars by the moon?‚Äù Agatha nodded, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Jupiter and Mars. Now if you look over here,‚Äù Rio shifted the telescope slightly, hand on the small of Agatha‚Äôs back, guiding her, ‚ÄúYou can see the constellation Phoenix. It has the bright star at the bottom, makes the diamond shape to the north and west, and the triangle to the east.‚Äù Rio explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. She knew what a phoenix was, but she could tell that Rio was passionate about the sciences and wanted to listen to her for hours. ‚ÄúTell me about it?‚Äù She stood and looked at her, placing a hand on Rio‚Äôs hip and guiding her to lay down on the plush blanket with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before Agatha could lead them down, however, Rio hooked a thumb through one of the belt loops of Agatha‚Äôs pants and pulled Agatha against her, looping her other arm around Agatha‚Äôs shoulders and slowly slid their lips together, sighing into their kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha parted her lips for Rio immediately, flexing her fingers into her hip, and ran her other thumb along Rio‚Äôs jaw. Agatha needed to feel as much skin as she could, as if she had to ensure Rio was real. She whimpered when Rio broke the kiss to guide them to lay down, Agatha‚Äôs original intention.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong there, slugger?‚Äù Rio had a smug look in her eye as she pulled Agatha down and pushed her on her back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou know, funny thing. I was kissing this beautiful woman, and suddenly I wasn‚Äôt, which is a rare occurrence for me. However, this particular woman has a pattern and it‚Äôs maddening.‚Äù Agatha was smiling, clearly joking, as she stared into Rio‚Äôs eyes and ran one hand up her back, the other twisting in Rio‚Äôs hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou mean there‚Äôs at least one woman on this planet who manages to have some self-control around the great Agatha Harkness?‚Äù Rio teased as she lay halfway on top of Agatha. One arm propped her up as she snaked the other hand inside Agatha‚Äôs jacket and under her vest to rest on the bare skin of her side. When Agatha raised one eyebrow at the touch, Rio had just shrugged, saying her hand was cold.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTell me about the constellations.‚Äù Agatha reminded her as she raised her head and kissed Rio again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know you know about phoenixes,‚Äù she rolled her eyes, as Agatha had been compared to the mythological bird many times, ‚Äúbut, the myth is that when the bird dies, it rises from the ashes and begins anew. An oversimplification, which you know.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hummed her admittance. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a phoenix yourself, kid. Giving this,‚Äù she gestured between them, ‚Äú a shot after what happened. Thank you, for trusting me.‚Äù She traced Rio‚Äôs jawline, meeting her for another kiss, this one longer, deeper, more meaningful. Agatha held Rio by the nape of her neck and waist. As Rio‚Äôs hand on Agatha‚Äôs skin tightened its grip, her other hand instinctively found its way to Agatha‚Äôs hair. Agatha‚Äôs tongue flicked across Rio‚Äôs lip as she nipped it with her teeth before she ran her tongue along Rio‚Äôs own, the roof of her mouth, the back of her teeth, anywhere she could reach. The only time she even slightly broke from Rio was so they could breathe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled so that she was on top of Rio, their bodies pressed together, deepening the kiss. She knew they were the only ones in the park, a perk of being Agatha Fucking Harkness. Rio‚Äôs hands had moved inside Agatha‚Äôs jacket, exploring her back and grateful Agatha had opted against a shirt under the vest, as Agatha moved from Rio‚Äôs mouth, kissing down her jawline and drew her earlobe into her mouth. Rio moaned as Agatha dragged her nails across her collarbone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha.‚Äù Rio breathed. She was flooded with heat and wanted this to continue, but knew it couldn‚Äôt, especially not outside, on the ground, not with Agatha like this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMmm?‚Äù Agatha was kissing down her neck like she was on a mission, and she was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe have to stop.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had withdrawn her hands and put them both on Agatha‚Äôs chest, itching to put them lower, even though that was a bad idea. She looked down at Agatha as the other brunette put an end to her mission and came back up to give Rio a chaste kiss on the lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded and rolled onto her back, pulling Rio back to her side as a star shot across the sky. Yes, Rio was right. They hadn‚Äôt rushed anything else, so why rush this? Agatha could be patient and Rio was worth it, she was worth everything, and she would prove to Rio that no matter what Rio believed, she had been put in a terrible situation by a psychopathic bitch, but that didn‚Äôt mean anything was wrong with Rio, far from it. She had lived a life where things had happened TO her, not BECAUSE of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They lay there as the stars fell around them, Rio educating Agatha about the names of meteor showers, this particular one being the Orionids, their causes, and pointing out more constellations as they kissed during silent pauses, played with each other‚Äôs hair and held hands. Agatha had never had this with anyone and drunk it all in. She felt peaceful, removed from watchful eyes, the weight of fame, knowing that the woman beside her saw her for who she was. Agatha the person, not Agatha the star. She watched Rio talk as she came to a stop and turned towards Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat is it? You‚Äôre looking at me all weird, do I have a big bug on my face?‚Äù She asked, not even moving to swat at the imaginary insect.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head. ‚ÄúI just appreciate you,‚Äù She looked up at the sky, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your ‚Äòwish upon a star‚Äô there, princess?‚Äù Agatha said, deflecting to her sarcastic humor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       That you would finish revealing yourself to me. That I would let myself love you. That you would fall in love with me.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Rio couldn‚Äôt bring herself to say any of that, instead, she went with something safe, ‚ÄúThat you‚Äôd finish out your triple EGOT.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha breathed a laugh, ‚ÄúPlease. Your falling rock wish is not for me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It is, but not to win an award.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt is!‚Äù She argued as Agatha gave her a look. ‚ÄúOkay, fine, for Raven to live forever.‚Äù That was not a lie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat I actually do believe,‚Äù Agatha affirmed. ‚ÄúMine is not to lose the people close to me.‚Äù
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       You, specifically.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She revealed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting colder. Are you ready to go back?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúStay the night with me?‚Äù Agatha asked in a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Saturday, of course,‚Äù Rio whispered back as she kissed Agatha again. She had waited to kiss Agatha for months, and now she got to do it freely. Somewhere, past Rio was deceased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Agatha drove them back to the compound, she considered their sleeping arrangements. They had shared a bed, but never her actual bed at her main residence, not even the previous weekend when they had kissed for the first time, Rio still opting for the couch. Come to think of it, she had never shared that bed with anyone that she didn‚Äôt consider family. It was intimate and a big deal, but she was letting Rio drive this at her speed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhere exactly are we sleeping tonight darling?‚Äù Agatha asked, trying not to sound shady.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYour house.‚Äù Rio gave nothing in her answer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhere in my house?‚Äù Agatha prodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew how to push Agatha‚Äôs buttons and she had fun doing it. ‚ÄúA room, preferably on a horizontal surface.‚Äù She grinned as she placed her hand on Agatha‚Äôs upper thigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSmartass,‚Äù Agatha mumbled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
</span>
</em>
<span>
      Rio turned slightly serious, ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs okay with you, sweetheart, your bed, in your room, in your arms,‚Äù Rio gave Agatha another bright smile, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wearing clothes though. If you‚Äôre good, we can continue that, ehm, conversation we started under the stars.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha loved Rio‚Äôs smile, returning one of her own as she slid her hand up Rio‚Äôs thigh, slightly under the hem of her skirt, ‚ÄúI can be good.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed as her phone dinged.

      Agatha lay in bed staring in amazement at Rio in her arms, breathing peacefully. Normally, Rio would have been gone by now, having gone home to feed the main gal in her life. Agatha needed to find the inventors of that darn auto feeder and hug them. Rio already had a camera that she used to check in on the senior citizen periodically, or else that would have been the next purchase. Agatha had always been tactile with her friends but never with romantic or sexual partners. Her ex hadn‚Äôt liked Agatha being touchy, so she hadn‚Äôt been. Agatha had been kept secret, and so they‚Äôd been secretive. Not Rio. No, they‚Äôd always touched, and now that they were in solid ‚Äòmore than friends‚Äô territory, they were rarely apart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha considered getting up and making breakfast, but she didn‚Äôt want to move Rio, nor did she want to break the contact. Instead, she kissed her forehead, her cheek, her nose, and any place she could with her limited range of motion. She needed to confess everything to Rio, the complete story, before falling even further for her. She pushed that aside for now. She could control that and just would shut that part of her off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stirred, opening her eyes halfway. ‚ÄúMornin‚Äô,‚Äù She said with a yawn before she nuzzled into Agatha‚Äôs shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGood Morning.‚Äù Agatha kissed Rio on the top of the head, bringing her closer. ‚ÄúSleep okay?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sleeping here more from now on. Your bed is more comfortable than mine.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe bed, or me?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBoth.‚Äù Rio rolled away and stretched. ‚ÄúSeriously though, a girl could get used to this, Agatha, better be careful. She winked as she got out of the bed. ‚ÄúNow, come make breakfast with me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While Rio‚Äôs admission scared Agatha, she also found herself wanting Rio to wake up beside her every morning.

      Rio was ignoring the sociopathic elephant on her phone. It was two texts. Nothing was going to happen, so SF knew they had gone stargazing Saturday night. Big deal. She had done this before, pinging her phone for her location in some third-party app, even once having a private inspector follow her. If anything else like that happened, she would wipe her phone and just watch herself better. She had a few more months until the restraining order expired, it would be fine. What Rio was more concerned about was the fact that the cat was out of the bag. Photos from dinner were all over the internet. That, coupled with the premiere and pictures from New York, people were doing the math. Her first name had even been leaked, and they had a hashtag.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha Harkness seen out on the town with new friend, ‚ÄòRio‚Äô‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThird Rio sighting! Is it serious, or are they just friends?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúJust gals being pals!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWith ‚ÄòMy Beloved‚Äô nominated for the Grammy for Movie Theme Song, do you think Agatha will take her?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt last until February.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚Äú#Wagatha or #Agathario?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe have to find out her last name, surely #Agathario is not the best we can do!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis from the people that gave us #WandaNat for Wanda and her bodyguard.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBecause their last names literally form THEIR LAST NAMES.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI ship them now.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs temporary.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI heard Agatha was making out with some woman at a club last week.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúVision, surrounded by lesbians, including his own wife.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚Äú#WandaVision forever!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not even that pretty.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio groaned as she put her phone down, straightened, and got the papers together that she needed for her first class of the day. It was Monday, and there were still two weeks until Thanksgiving break. She didn‚Äôt have Nicky until her fifth period but had Tommy first and Billy third. The bell rang as students filed in, strangely quiet for her class. ‚ÄúGuys?‚Äù She looked at them all. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her room of 15 freshman biology students looked at each other sheepishly before her eyes landed on Tommy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTommy, tell me.‚Äù She instructed as he turned bright red. The team had won on Friday night and would be advancing to the Division Championship game on Friday, so she wasn‚Äôt sure why students were quiet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI told everyone you and Aunt Aggie were seeing each other, but not together‚Ä¶‚Äù He started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She nodded. The collective wanted the gossip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúA teacher‚Äôs private life is not your business.‚Äù She smirked as they groaned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMs. Vidal, our parents are famous. We‚Äôre going to hear about it anyway.‚Äù Monica, Carol Danvers‚Äôs daughter, said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true‚Ä¶‚Äù Rio said as she thought it over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe all know the drama from last year.‚Äù Another student added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSome of us live on the compound,‚Äù Tommy mentioned to laughter from his classmates.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio grinned. ‚ÄúMight as well come from the primary source, then. Tommy is right. Ms. Harkness and I went on a date. We are not together as reported. We have been friends all year, happy?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMs. Jones is going to be upset,‚Äù America Chavez shook her head. Rio had been handing out study materials and stopped, waiting for America to continue, ‚ÄúSurely you know about everything from last year, Ms. Vidal? A lot of the teachers were‚Ä¶involved, with Agatha. Ms. Jones was absolutely in love with her.‚Äù America finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tommy rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúMs. Jones was just another in a long line of hookups, everyone was. Ri‚Ä¶Ms. Vidal is the real deal.‚Äù He defended Rio, and she smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay, well, let‚Äôs look at your study guide for your upcoming unit test, please.‚Äù She redirected, knowing that this set would spread the word.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Teaching at SHIELD was not for the faint of heart, with students who were on top of all the celebrity gossip running around. That was also how she found out that Carol Danvers had won ‚Äòfirst kiss on Halloween‚Äô, Coach Rogers had ‚ÄòVidal freaks out‚Äô, Lilia for their date last Saturday, but not actually dating. Wanda felt like she had an unfair advantage because she knew Rio‚Äôs past. Rio and Nat had been filled in on the previous Stalker situation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio ran into Jessica Jones, a middle school math teacher, in the teacher‚Äôs lounge.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt last, you know.‚Äù Jessica spat, seething. Rio just shrugged, wanting to avoid the confrontation, and went to Alice‚Äôs classroom instead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI did not expect drama,‚Äù Rio said, sitting on top of a table and eating her lunch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked at her. ‚ÄúAgatha has slept with her very unfair share of women, Ri. What did you expect?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but it wasn‚Äôt students prying, other teachers being jealous, the men high-fiving me‚Ä¶Rogers fucking HUGGED me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice started laughing. ‚ÄúYeah, because Peggy has a thing for Agatha, and he‚Äôs glad she‚Äôs off the market.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked skeptical, ‚ÄúPeggy is pregnant.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIf you were pregnant, married to a man, and Agatha Fucking Harkness hit on you, would you turn her down, even if you were, to quote the late, great Lorna Wu, tragically straight?‚Äù Alice gestured to the sky as she mentioned her mother.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio grinned. ‚ÄúOh, absolutely not.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhere is your girlfriend this week?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not my girlfriend. Agatha is filming this week and next/shut down for Thanksgiving, two more weeks in the US. Shut down for Christmas and the New Year, and then Canada in January.‚Äù Rio checked the clock to ensure she had a few minutes before class.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou still knew who I was talking about, though.‚Äù Alice pointed out.
     </span>
</p>

<span>
      ‚ÄúWhatever. Speaking of, any updates on your front?‚Äù

<span>
      Alice looked down, chewing on the inside of her cheek. Rio‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúShit, I was teasing. Has something changed?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúUmm, Jen asked me to move in with her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWHAT? It took you two a fucking decade to make a move, and now you‚Äôre going all in?‚Äù Rio was trying very hard not to shout. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm assuming her house?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shook her head. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thinking of buying a house or even building.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio brought her voice down a notch, ‚ÄúHoly shit, Alice. That‚Äôs a lot. Are you sure.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been ten years. We haven‚Äôt been together until recently, but my feelings were there, and I feel like there‚Äôs lost time. I accidentally blurted out that I loved her last week.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn‚Äôt put her feelings for Agatha into words, and Alice and Jen had gone into hyperdrive. ‚ÄúWhat did she say?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe loves me too,‚Äù Alice smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLesbians,‚Äù Rio smiled and shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYeah, so, catch the fuck up,‚Äù Alice said as the bell rang.
     </span>

      On Wednesday, Rio received flowers at school that Lilia personally brought to Rio‚Äôs classroom at the end of her fifth period, AP Chemistry, which one Nicky Harkness was in. Twelve sets of eyes were on her as she took the beautiful and tasteful bouquet of blue, pink, and purple hydrangeas, blue and pink azaleas, purple violets, and lavender. Her cheeks were tinged with pink as the teenagers‚Äô ‚Äúoohs‚Äù and ‚Äúawws‚Äù filled the room, and a few of them ribbed Nicky about how his mom had game. The bell rang, and the students left the room as Lilia stood there, eyebrows raised at Lilia. With a wink at Rio, Nicky had grabbed a beaker, filled it with water, stole three pink hydrangeas, and jogged out of the room, calling after Morgan Stark. Rio couldn‚Äôt help but smile after the boy she loved like her own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia walked over and shut the door before turning back to Rio. ‚ÄúI know I encouraged this Rio, and I do. I expect the drama to be kept to a minimum. That said, I expect this to end much better than your last relationship. As long as you‚Äôre completely honest and you confront any issues head-on. Have a good week, Ms. Vidal. It‚Äôs almost Thanksgiving!‚Äù She left, and Rio just stood there before reading the card.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know the next few weeks are busy, but I wanted to let you know I miss you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took a picture of her flowers and sent it to the coven before texting Agatha.

      Agatha was in between takes as she sat in a chair with her name on the back. She was filming for her new TV show. She knew the question was silly, but she wanted the confirmation.

<span>
      Agatha didn‚Äôt have the traditional school experience growing up, but she imagined this was what passing the ‚Äòdo you like me‚Äô notes was like. She was blushing and knew she looked like she had a school-girl crush right now. She didn‚Äôt care. She took a screenshot of the conversation and sent it to Wanda, who told her she was a child.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was smiling at the confirmation that Agatha Harkness liked her as if it hadn‚Äôt been blatantly obvious.

<span>
      Agatha put her phone down. She couldn‚Äôt remember a time in her life when she smiled this much. Rio was talking about handling Nicky‚Äôs dating life together, and her heart had soared. She didn‚Äôt want to unpack that right now. At the same time, she felt guilty for not coming clean.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat was helping Wanda run lines when the picture of the flowers showed up in the group chat. Wanda and Nat looked at each other and smiled.. Jen sighed and jotted down notes about future statements while browsing real estate listings. Alice had already known, as some of her sixth-period students had been in Rio‚Äôs fifth period.

      It was another Friday night, and another football game at SHIELD. Lilia ‚ÄòJust Keep the Secrets and Keep the Kids Alive‚Äô Calderu was trying her best to keep the media at bay, the lesbian drama to a minimum, the elementary school holiday pageants were coming up, and the secondary school musical was right after Thanksgiving. Then she had parents gambling on one of her teacher's love lives with Agatha Harkness and the usual teenage hormones to deal with. She deserved a vacation, and if it wasn‚Äôt for her own affinity to once sleep with parents, and now grandparents, of students, she would consider a no fraternizing policy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Agatha were holding hands in public at a high school football game. Elementary parents who didn‚Äôt have high school students involved in the game ran the concessions, so she and the coven were free to watch the whole time. It was half-time, and SHIELD was losing to Bayside of all teams. Rio was walking back from the restroom when Jessica Jones confronted her for the second time that week.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôre just temporary, Vidal.‚Äù She said, looking her up and down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúJessica, I have no issue with you. I‚Äôm sorry things didn‚Äôt work out between the two of you.‚Äù Rio was trying to be cordial. She didn‚Äôt like confrontation or drama.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha came up beside Rio, wrapping a protective arm around her waist. She was wearing a gold and black SHIELD beanie and a letterman jacket with Harkness on the back and looked every bit the proud mom she was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHi, babe.‚Äù She said to Rio, kissing her on the cheek. She was making a very bold statement, and she knew it. ‚ÄúHi Jessica, nice to see you supporting the team.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jessica turned bright red, ‚ÄúHello, Agatha. Nicky‚Äôs been great this year.‚Äù Jessica was somewhere between embarrassed and shocked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha regarded her, eyes narrow, face somewhat severe. Rio loved it. She knew Agatha was sending a clear, nonverbal message, and it sent a chill down her spine. The woman that famously didn‚Äôt date and that left women longing in her wake, was letting someone know that she had chosen Rio and to alert the masses. It was like some type of lesbian standoff, and Jessica was the first to break.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy for both of you,‚Äù Jessica said finally before she nodded at Agatha and stalked off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned and laughed. ‚ÄúHow do you do that? Just mind control women?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgain, not giving away my secret,‚Äù She kissed Rio quickly on the mouth, seeing her surprise. ‚ÄúIs it okay that I kiss you at school? I should‚Äôve asked that first.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, ‚ÄúEveryone else kisses there‚Ä¶whatever.‚Äù Not sure what to call Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù She led Rio back to where they were sitting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda had witnessed everything as she Venmo‚Äôd Pepper for ‚Äòstaking claims at the football game.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had also witnessed everything and just hoped that was the end of the teacher drama.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      SHIELD lost the game, and their playoff run was over. Bayside rubbed it in a bit too much. Nat wanted to punch the principal in the face and rip his toupee off, ever the protective mom she was. While there were tears, the students were also excited that they had made it as far as they had in sports. In a flurry of emotion, Billy had gone up to Eddie and kissed him full on the mouth in front of everyone. Wanda, through tears at seeing the boys lose, took a picture and sent it to Eddie‚Äôs parents. Billy was proud of his boyfriend as he had caught one of Nicky‚Äôs passes for a touchdown. He had also fumbled a ball but wasn‚Äôt focused on that part. Morgan Stark had told Nicky he did a good job and asked if he was busy the next night and if he wanted to come over and watch a movie. Pepper promised Agatha that SHE would be the one to supervise and that she would send Tony over to Coach Rogers's house. Vision gave Tommy a pep talk about how they couldn‚Äôt win them all.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn‚Äôt until they got home that the adults realized how crushed their souls were. Tommy was mad and blaming the refs, as Vision waxed poetic about defeat, and the redheads had to tell him this wasn‚Äôt the best time for philosophy. Meanwhile, Agatha reassured Nicky that he had done the absolute best he could and that it really was not his fault.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIf I had just called better plays, Mom!‚Äù He was full of regret and blamed himself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh honey, even the greatest players don‚Äôt win every game. You are sixteen years old, and you did a great job. I am so proud of you,‚Äù They were sitting on the couch and she ran a hand through his hair. He was six foot tall now to her five foot five. They had to sit so she could reach the top of his head. ‚ÄúI love you so much, Nicholas,‚Äù she wrapped her arms around his shoulders. He would always be her little boy, no matter how old he was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMom?‚Äù He sniffled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, baby?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúCan I ask you something, and you be completely honest with me?‚Äù He knew his mother and knew she spoke in half-truths.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a scary question, but yes. I promise to be completely honest.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDo you love Rio?‚Äù He sounded like a little boy, and she knew why he was asking. He needed to know if Rio was permanent. His mother had never dated anyone during his life, and this was new to him. He had to know if he could be vulnerable with Rio. If he could let her in and get close to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHonest answer, kid? I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù She had feelings for Rio, she knew that much, but she honestly didn‚Äôt know if she was capable of loving someone again. She couldn‚Äôt even bring herself to tell Rio about that part of her life, she was still so damaged, and it had ended eighteen years ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs possible? I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm new to all this. I don‚Äôt want that to change or influence how you treat or act around her, though. Do not keep her at arm's length because I don‚Äôt know how to handle big feelings, okay?‚Äù Nicky was already forming a close bond with Rio, and she didn‚Äôt want to ruin that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky looked at his mom, the emotional idiot that she was. ‚ÄúYou look at her the way Aunt Wanda looks at Aunt Nat, you know,‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She scoffed, ‚ÄúI absolutely do not.‚Äù she lied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He gave her a small smile, ‚ÄúMom, to borrow your favorite f-word, please don‚Äôt fuck this up.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She couldn‚Äôt help but smile at her son, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even mad that you swore.‚Äù

      The next night was movie night, and Agatha and Rio were on their own having a date night at Rio‚Äôs. They were making comments on some cheesy lesbian Christmas movie as Rio lay with her head in Agatha‚Äôs lap when Agatha‚Äôs phone dinged with a text from Jen.

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked down at Rio, grinning from ear to ear, tugging her hair to get her attention.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked up at her with a questioning look. ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôre about to tell me we‚Äôre all mad here.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe are, but no. What are you doing December 8th?‚Äù Agatha asked her, knowing the answer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWatching a grainy livestream of the final Taylor Swift show.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow would you like to be there in a VIP tent, with me and the rest of the coven?‚Äù Agatha tried to remain composed, but she could not.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrieked as she sat up. ‚ÄúWHAT?! Really!? YES!‚Äù She threw her arms around Agatha and kissed her, pulling back as reality hit, ‚ÄúWait, that‚Äôs a school night.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou and Alice will have subs. Just took care of it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrieked again, kissing Agatha. ‚ÄúI promise I like you for you and not just the perks.‚Äù She said after pausing for a breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed, leaning into Rio, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt doubt that for a second.‚Äù Agatha knew Rio never expected anything. She just liked making Rio smile, no matter what it took.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The moment was broken when there was a knock on the door. Agatha raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúExpecting someone?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, you know, just one of my many other megastar suitors,‚Äù Rio joked, opening the door to another bouquet sitting in the otherwise empty hallway. She picked them up and turned around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBabe, more flowers? I‚Äôm going to run out of room.‚Äù She huffed a laugh as she closed the door and turned to kiss Agatha, who had come up behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was not smiling. ‚ÄúRio, those aren‚Äôt from me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stilled as Agatha guided her back to the couch. Rio looked at the flowers, brain quickly working.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAll flowers have multiple meanings, positive and negative,‚Äù She mumbled aloud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. She had looked up every single flower she had sent Rio, since Alice warned her that Rio would dissect it like this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio went on, ‚ÄúCalla lilies, my least favorite, rebirth and union. Marigolds can symbolize jealousy, as can yellow roses, which can also symbolize possession. Red roses stand for love, of course, but these‚Ä¶‚Äù Rio looked at their rich color. ‚ÄúThese mean obsession. The dark orchids for mystery and possession, and white lilies for obsession and mourning.‚Äù Her voice was devoid of all emotion. She hadn‚Äôt even read the card yet they both knew what this meant. Both women just stared at the offending flowers as if they would come alive at any moment and swallow them both whole.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs eyes landed on the card as she reached a shaky hand towards it. Agatha took her hand and met her eyes. ‚ÄúTogether?‚Äù Agatha asked. Rio nodded as they took the card. Rio let out the breath she was holding as they opened it. She froze as she took in the words in the all too familiar handwriting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have movie night every Saturday too, watching the movies we made.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The blood in Rio‚Äôs veins turned to ice and she forgot how to breathe. Agatha threw the card down as if it had burst into flames.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gathering everyone. NOW.‚Äù Agatha said, venom in her voice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, this is my problem. No one else has to get involved.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh yes, the hell we can.‚Äù Agatha was on the move. ‚ÄúThis fucking bitch. Who the fuck does she think she is?‚Äù She stopped when she saw the fear in Rio‚Äôs eyes. Agatha dropped down to her knees in front of Rio. Agatha put one hand on Rio‚Äôs knee and the other on her cheek. ‚ÄúTrust me?‚Äù She asked, eyes pleading. Agatha couldn‚Äôt confront her feelings, nor could she confess everything, but she could do this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, tears filling her eyes. Out of all the people she knew, Agatha was the third person in her life who had seen her cry this much. ‚ÄúI do,‚Äù Rio replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pulled out her phone and sent a text to the group chat. All it said was ‚Äòmy house, 911.‚Äô She pulled Rio into a gentle kiss, wiping away her tears. ‚ÄúPack yours and Raven‚Äôs shit. You both are staying at my house for a few days.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Rio were the last to arrive at the compound, and tensions were high as the other women met them in the driveway. Rio parked so they could help unload.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow much does this cat need?‚Äù Nat asked, grabbing the autofeeder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our niece you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù Wanda tried to lighten the mood. She knew it had to be serious if Agatha had made both of them come.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Ten minutes later, once everyone was settled and Raven was roaming the house, all eyes were on Rio and Agatha as they sat in the living room as if it was any other Saturday night. Agatha was in protective mode with both arms around the younger woman. ‚ÄúFloor‚Äôs all yours. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm with you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio exhaled deeply as she looked at Nat and Wanda. ‚ÄúDid Agatha tell you about the stalker situation?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. ‚ÄúBriefly, yes.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, she reached out today.‚Äù As she pointed at the flowers they had brought with them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat automatically checked them for tracking devices or bugs, finding none.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThere was this too.‚Äù She flinched as she tossed the card on the table for the other four women to read.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned in to whisper in Rio‚Äôs ear, ‚ÄúJen knew before I did?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was ranting to Alice, and it came up, and she was there, so yes.‚Äù Rio looked at Agatha apologetically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wasn‚Äôt completely sure how to feel about Jen knowing about SF first, but it made sense. They turned back towards the others.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo can we assume that these are not family-friendly movies?‚Äù Wanda asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed. She had many regrets, and those videos were among her biggest ones. ‚ÄúShe hated that we couldn‚Äôt be public and that was one of her ways to make it up to me,‚Äù Rio explained, voice small.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt was a manipulation and future blackmail technique,‚Äù Jen gulped straight vodka. She sympathized with her friend, she did, but she also saw the potential scandal.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave her a scathing look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIf anything happens, we‚Äôll deal with it. This isn‚Äôt the time to worry about reputations, Jennifer.‚Äù Agatha said with a biting tone. Jen jumped a little at the use of her given name.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDamn, using your full name,‚Äù Alice remarked as she rubbed her girlfriend's thigh with one hand and put her other hand over Jen‚Äôs mouth, looking around the room. ‚ÄúWhat we need to do right now is worry about how to head this off. I know this bitch. This is a thinly veiled threat.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having my tech girl look into the cameras at Rio and Alice‚Äôs place. Those flowers were hand-delivered.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, SF is good. She is too smart to come herself. She probably paid some rando outside to bring it. No, you wouldn‚Äôt have caught that either. She likely knows where all the cameras are. She may or may not have a past.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha huffed a laugh, ‚ÄúSo, what you‚Äôre saying is, you have a type?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A small smile tugged at Rio‚Äôs lips before disappearing when Nat confirmed what Rio had said about disabling cameras. ‚ÄúDarcy just texted. Even worse, all the cameras in your building went down for a few minutes this evening.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked up at Rio, ‚ÄúYou have to tell us who she is.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked at Rio as Rio shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, some of you have too much to risk. Only the bare minimum people need to know.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded and motioned towards Agatha‚Äôs brag room, ‚ÄúJust me then, come on.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed Rio‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúGo,‚Äù she lightly nudged her off the couch as Rio rose and followed Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Three sets of eyes landed on Alice as she shook her head, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not telling any of you anything.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat directed Rio into the room and closed the door behind them, looking expectantly towards Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wrapped her arms around herself. ‚ÄúWhat do you know about models?‚Äù She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre hot and vapid?‚Äù Nat responded, trying to make Rio laugh, which worked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay, yes. What do you know about Lou Falco?‚Äù Rio asked, looking down at her foot as she flexed her toes nervously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat‚Äôs eyes went wide. ‚ÄúLou Falco, former Victoria‚Äôs Secret model? Married to former football player turned broadcaster/actor Shane Falco? Lesbian rumors for years, Lou Falco? OH GOD, YOU WERE THE RUMORED SECRET GIRLFRIEND?!‚Äù The pieces were falling into place for Nat as her eyes grew wider.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio clapped a hand over Nat‚Äôs mouth. ‚ÄúQuiet down, Sherlock. Yes, I was. But, now, there‚Äôs a restraining order.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat licked her palm and grinned when Rio grimaced and wiped it on her jeans. ‚ÄúGross.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to have high-powered lawyers, but not as high-powered as Wagatha‚Äôs. When does the order expire?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDecember 31st, 11:59 P.M.‚Äù Rio recited.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis is the first time she‚Äôs done anything?‚Äù Nat asked, looking at Rio intently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave a quick nod, not giving anything away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to dust the vase for prints, but she‚Äôs brilliant, went to an Ivy League, and never got caught for her small run of burglaries. I don‚Äôt expect to find even an eyelash.‚Äù Nat thought out loud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow do you know about any of that?‚Äù Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat smirked, ‚ÄúHave you met me?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRight. Spy.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, I‚Äôll take care of it. You‚Äôre safe, okay?‚Äù Nat knew Rio was worried, and this was Nat‚Äôs job. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre staying here for a few days, and I‚Äôll let you know when everything‚Äôs okay.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio threw her arms around the smaller woman, ‚ÄúThank you so much, Natasha.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat hugged her back and smiled. She would always protect these women. It was who she was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They returned to the main room. Rio returned to Agatha‚Äôs side as Nat grabbed the tainted flowers and the card and walked out, Wanda on her heels.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at Agatha, eyebrows raised, ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs the battle plan in case this goes terribly?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned her eyes to Raven as the cat hopped on her lap. ‚ÄúWe go with plan R,‚Äù She was only half joking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat left for a few days, and everyone was on edge, especially Wanda. This is what Natasha did. She took care of the darker parts of fame, but that didn‚Äôt make things easier, especially now that they were on the precipice of finally beginning a proper life together. Vision came gliding through the room and stopped when he saw Wanda, leaning against the kitchen island, staring wistfully at her phone. The boys were at school, and he was on his way out the door to teach a class.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNat will be perfectly fine,‚Äù he had been briefed on the situation and was trying to be every bit the emotional support human that he was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI just worry. She‚Äôs not twenty-five anymore,‚Äù Wanda knew Nat was still in amazing shape, and her lack of height was useful for sneaking around, but without knowing what she was planning, or who the other woman even was, her anxiety was on high alert.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision put a comforting hand on her shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNatasha Romanov can run circles around men half her age. When she‚Äôs eighty, she will still be able to take down CIA agents at the top of their game. She will always come back to you, darling. I have no doubt.‚Äù He kissed the top of her head as he grabbed his bag for school. Wanda sighed as she looked after him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúVis?‚Äù She said tentatively.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, dear?‚Äù he half turned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI really am‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off as he smiled and put up a hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not. Nothing has changed between us when you think about it.‚Äù He waved as he walked out of the door.
     </span>

      I love you too.

<p>
<span>
      I missed you.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

      Hopefully, this meant everything was handled, and they could all move on with their lives.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat burned her disguise underneath an unmarked bridge. She still got a thrill when she got to do the super shady things. They were so rare these days. She had sent quite the message to Lou, all verbal, and had made sure she wasn‚Äôt tracked, no physical evidence. She made sure that Lou knew to back off and leave Rio and Agatha alone, or she‚Äôd be leaking divorce documents, custody orders, things that could ruin her career and reputation. She‚Äôd also visit the ex-husband. She would never see her children again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat had saved the ‚ÄòI will make you disappear, and they will never find the body‚Äô speech. She didn‚Äôt think she needed it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou looked at the window the pretty brute had slipped out of. It hadn‚Äôt been the first time someone had tried to intimidate her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This one made a simple but important miscalculation. It was silly to think Lou cared about her kids more than Rio. Rio was the most important thing in her life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had enjoyed staying with Agatha for the few days it took Nat to take care of the Lou situation. When Nicky had come back to the house from Morgan Stark‚Äôs, he had taken one look at Raven and asked where the cat had come from. Those two were fast friends, and when Rio and Raven returned to Rio‚Äôs apartment Wednesday evening, Rio wasn‚Äôt sure who of the four of them was more upset about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky had Raven in his arms, and the big blue eyes he inherited from his mother were focused on Rio. ‚ÄúDoes she have to go?‚Äù He pleaded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSorry, kid.‚Äù Something Rio was quickly picking up from Agatha, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a package deal. My familiar comes with me.‚Äù Raven meowed in agreement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky looked between the two human women, trying to choose the next words carefully, but decided to just go for it, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lesbians. Shouldn‚Äôt you be moving in by now? Planning a wedding? Working on giving me a sibling?‚Äù He was prepared to run just in case one of them threw hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chose sarcasm. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a single fast-moving woman in this group, son.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBiology doesn‚Äôt work that way, but I can try,‚Äù Rio offered, making eyes at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúScience, and gross.‚Äù Nicky made a gagging sound. He had been prepared for physical swinging, not the verbal kind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúLike I didn‚Äôt catch you with your tongue down Morgan‚Äôs throat this morning.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs eyebrows almost flew off her head. ‚ÄúWear a condom. We are not sharing a grandchild with Tony before the two of you graduate.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned to Agatha, ‚ÄúWe?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou know what I mean.‚Äù She mumbled, blushing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you blushing?‚Äù Rio rarely saw Agatha blush or get flustered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The teenager took that as his cue, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to put things in Rio‚Äôs car.‚Äù He set Raven down and went to load the car.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sharing a hypothetical grandchild now?‚Äù Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, because he‚Äôs going to be smart.‚Äù Agatha regained her composure. ‚ÄúWant to spend Thanksgiving with us?‚Äù She changed the topic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded as Agatha kissed her, taking her mind off Nicky‚Äôs earlier questions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was the week of Thanksgiving and things had been relatively quiet. No texts or deliveries from SF, the public speculation had died down for the moment, and they were on break from school. Alice and Jen had put an offer in on a house they had fallen in love with immediately. The grass was green, the sky was blue, and everyone was gay.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was officially dating Morgan Stark, which Pepper Potts-Stark and Rio were excited about, and Tony Stark and Agatha were not. Billy and Eddie were going strong, and Tommy was more excited about running track next semester.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Alice had always spent the holidays together in San Francisco and were excited to spend them with their chosen family this year. Rio was making pies in her kitchen while Alice ‚Äòhelped‚Äô by watching and not touching anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHave the two of you decided what you are yet?‚Äù Alice asked as she drank tea.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo. We‚Äôre still just dating, but I think I might be ready to take the next step.‚Äù Rio slid a pie in the oven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúActually fuck Agatha Fucking Harkness?‚Äù Alice raised her eyebrows twice suggestively.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, yes, but no. I‚Äôm thinking more like making it official and declare we‚Äôre dating,‚Äù Rio said as she started on a chocolate pie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about damn time. Four months, you‚Äôve spent the last one playing tonsil hockey, and she‚Äôs taking you to Taylor Swift.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs taking all of us,‚Äù Rio interrupted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhatever, it‚Äôs you that counts. She also had Nat get rid of Lou.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNat threatened Lou. Bitch is still alive,‚Äù Rio corrected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúUnfortunately. She moved you into her house for a few days to keep you safe. Which you LOVED,‚Äù Alice reminded her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù Rio blushed. The truth was, she had loved it. Four nights falling asleep in Agatha‚Äôs arms, four mornings waking up in them. When Nicky joked about moving in, she found herself fantasizing about it. It was too soon for that, but she wanted it one day. She wanted the Agatha of it all. She cooked for them each night and helped Nicky with his homework. They had played house for a few days, and she loved it. She shook the memories from her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhether I loved it or not is beside the point. Maybe one day it will happen. When are you asking Jen to marry you?‚Äù She flipped the conversation. At least someone was moving their relationship forward. Wanda had to wait until her divorce, since papers were drawn up but not filed yet, and Rio had just decided to make things official with Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice choked on her drink. ‚ÄúExcuse you?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat? You‚Äôre buying a house. Are you not going to get married? I‚Äôve already appointed myself as Maid of Honor. I‚Äôm trying to decide if I‚Äôll wear a suit or a dress. I assume it won‚Äôt be a giant affair. Neither of you is that type,‚Äù Rio grinned, putting the next pie in the refrigerator.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shook her head, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve spent too much time with Wanda.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Alice had gone home and the pies were ready to go to Agatha‚Äôs, Rio settled in for the night.

      past two years, we went

</p>
<p>

     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Plus her kids.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha read the text multiple times. Rio hadn‚Äôt mentioned that before. Why hadn‚Äôt she told her that? Agatha had to remind herself that there were still things she was hiding as well.

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled at that. It was a mix of sincerity and wanting to take away the painful memories, the protective side of Agatha, and a tinge of jealousy.

<p>
</p>
<p>

<span>
      Rio sighed in contentment. She would have a stress-free day, cook with her friends, and at the end of the day, she would tell Agatha Fucking Harkness that she was ready to be her girlfriend. She giggled to herself at the absurdity of it, like she was about to ask someone out for the first time.

      Are you coming to Thanksgiving
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      tomorrow? You‚Äôre my family
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      and I miss you.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio groaned and rolled over. Surely this bitch was kidding. Rio decided that if she received any texts on Thanksgiving, she‚Äôd let Nat know.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Thanksgiving was perfect. Rio had arrived at Agatha‚Äôs at seven that morning, let herself in after she disarmed the alarm, and placed the pies on the counter. She went upstairs to Agatha‚Äôs bedroom and found Agatha sound asleep in just panties and an oversized T-shirt. Her hair had returned to its factory settings, and messy curls were fanning out around her. She was curled on her side, both arms under her pillow. Rio toed off her shoes and crawled into the bed next to her, knowing that she could have run and jumped on the bed at full speed, and Agatha wouldn‚Äôt have budged. Rio positioned herself under the covers and brushed strands of hair away from the actress's face, scooting closer to her before lightly kissing her forehead, cheek, nose, and then lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled as she slowly opened her eyes, ‚ÄúGood morning, beautiful. Have I ever told you how much I prefer waking up like this?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOnly every time it happens.‚Äù Rio kissed her fully, morning breath and all. She knew it wasn‚Äôt long before the house was full of people, but she had changed her mind about when she wanted to talk to Agatha. Agatha‚Äôs lips parted as Rio moaned and slid her tongue alongside Agatha‚Äôs slowly. Rio trailed her hand from Agatha‚Äôs cheek down her shoulder to her breast, lightly running a thumb over her hardened nipple through the shirt as Rio rolled them so that she was on top, straddling Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha whimpered into Rio‚Äôs mouth, this woman was going to be the death of her. Agatha ran her hands up Rio‚Äôs back, under her shirt, before scratching down her back, eliciting a gasp from Rio. Rio discontinued her ministrations, breaking the kiss and sitting up, still straddling Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a brat, you know that?‚Äù Agatha reached up, lately tracing Rio‚Äôs collarbone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave her a toothy smile and nodded. ‚ÄúI have a question.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou can have whatever you want if we could just go back to what we were doing,‚Äù Agatha would find a way to single-handedly combat climate change if it meant she could continue kissing Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs face went serious as she put her hand on Agatha‚Äôs cheek and scooted back, lightly tugging Agatha so that she was sitting up, eyes locked on each other‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou,‚Äù Rio breathed. ‚ÄúAgatha, I want you, officially. As juvenile as it sounds, be my girlfriend? You can even post a statement, right now,‚Äù She was looking straight into Agatha‚Äôs soul.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      On the inside, Agatha was jumping for joy like a child on Christmas morning. On the outside, she was grinning at her
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       girlfriend.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not juvenile, and yes I will be. I want you as well.‚Äù She kissed Rio in a way that said
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Always.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She leaned back. ‚ÄúCan I post a picture of us later too?‚Äù She updated her socials fairly regularly and wanted to share her happiness with the world. She had promised not to keep Rio a secret, and she meant it. Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio‚Äôs waist and closed the space between their bodies.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNow, I believe you started something,‚Äù she fisted a hand in Rio‚Äôs hair and captured her mouth in a needy kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio cupped one of Agatha‚Äôs lace-clad buttcheeks in one hand and put the other hand on her shoulder. They were fighting for control of the kiss when they heard the door close downstairs and Wanda yell.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNow is when you two decide to do this? Get down here. We have a meal to cook!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They both groaned as they broke the kiss, breathing heavily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm buying a pack of scrunchies,‚Äù Agatha said.

      It was Thanksgiving morning, after all, and everyone was waiting downstairs. Once Agatha was presentable and everyone had busied themselves with meal preparations, Agatha took a picture of her and Rio and made a Jen-approved post on her socials.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHappy Thanksgiving from us to you. Thankful for my girlfriend, son, and amazing family and friends!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She threw in a few hashtags and let it go. Rio made a mental note to check the comments later when her phone dinged.

<span>
      WITH HER?!
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was also a picture attached, except it wasn‚Äôt the one Agatha had just posted. It was worse. It was of Agatha and Rio in Agatha‚Äôs bed, with Rio straddling Agatha and kissing her. It looked like the picture had been taken through the window. Rio was shaking. The phone dinged again. Another picture. This one of her staring at the phone. She looked up, trying to figure out the angle as she stormed out the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha noticed when Rio received the text and alerted Nat. When Rio went outside, everyone followed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs eyes were wide with panic and fear. She was rubbing the left side of her chest as she felt the familiar symptoms of a panic attack seep in. She whipped her head around to search for Lou, looking into the trees, bushes, everywhere. Then, she heard whirring of some kind and saw a flash of red hair leap into the air and take down a low-flying drone, landing in some superhero pose.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They heard a woman‚Äôs laugh, the slam of a car door, and a car speeding off. Nat looked at the drone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThere must have been two. This one is a red herring, but I‚Äôll take it to Darcy,‚Äù She was pissed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking another trip.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shook her head, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not leaving until tomorrow. Please,‚Äù she pled. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting to be ourselves this year.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was ready to commit murder herself as she wrapped her arms around a frozen and sobbing Rio. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, we‚Äôll increase security, it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù She soothed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned towards the group. ‚ÄúEveryone back inside, blinds and shades closed. We‚Äôre not letting her ruin this, okay?‚Äù She corralled everyone inside as Nat made calls and increased security around the compound.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      All eyes turned to Rio‚Äôs phone when it dinged again.

<span>
      Come back to me.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a psychopath,‚Äù Jen exclaimed after she read the text.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at the girlfriend whose hand she still held, ‚ÄúWas that the laugh we heard?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head, ‚ÄúNo. Someone else, a P.I. or someone she hired, most likely. I don‚Äôt trust it, though.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMom, what happened?‚Äù Nicky asked from the table. The three boys had picked up that something was happening but didn‚Äôt know what exactly, as they had been instructed to stay inside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio buried her face in her hands as she turned into Agatha and sobbed. Her world had crashed in as she realized that the boys were potentially in danger now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha held Rio tightly as if she was the only thing holding her together. The four parents exchanged looks, trying to decide how best to handle the conversation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was Alice who spoke instead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know you boys have some experience with this from your mom‚Äôs fame, but Rio has a stalker. A relentless one. It‚Äôs one of the reasons she moved here. We call her SF for San Francisco. If you say her name three times, she‚Äôll appear like Beetlejuice.‚Äù Billy smiled at that one. He was playing Beetlejuice in the school play in just a few days.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWas she hurt?‚Äù Tommy asked. He vaguely remembered someone sending his mom random notes a few years ago, but nothing came from it. He had heard horror stories at school, though.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was still seeking solace in Agatha and thankful that Tommy had gathered that now was not the time to ask Rio any direct questions. These boys were wise beyond their years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice nodded. ‚ÄúShe was. It‚Äôs why I brought her here. I knew she would be safe in our little coven.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky thought everything over carefully. He knew Alice hadn‚Äôt done it intentionally. She hadn‚Äôt known his mom would be taken by Rio, but he would have to thank her one day. Things were a little scary right now, but Rio had been good for every single person on the compound, especially his mom. Agatha had never been unhappy, necessarily, but he had never seen her this happy either. He and the twins had also deduced that Rio had been the one to make the final push for Aunt Wanda to make her decision as well, AND Jen and Alice were together. There was something about Rio that was magic. He also knew his mom and Mr. Stark weren‚Äôt on the best terms, so if Rio could smooth things over in that department, this could work for him, too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He came out of his thoughts as Billy shook him, ‚ÄúHey, space cadet. We‚Äôre going to help Jen monitor the internet for anything shady being posted.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky nodded. ‚ÄúSounds like a plan.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The excitement of the morning had died down, and cooking had resumed. There was still tension, but Nat had worked quickly to call in a few favors and increased security, pulled camera footage, and even called Darcy to see if she could trace the number that had texted Rio that morning. Unfortunately, SF was good and it led to a useless burner phone. That‚Äôs when Nat decided to create a clone of Rio‚Äôs phone on her computer and reverse-stalk Lou. The phone Lou was using was off, so she couldn‚Äôt see her current location. However, a few older texts came up. The texts from this morning were not the first Rio had received. That girl had been hiding this. Nat swore under her breath. Agatha had found someone who also dealt in half-truths. Nat walked into the kitchen, where the other women were cleaning up. ‚ÄúRio, can I borrow you for a minute? Nothing major.‚Äù She knew Rio was on high alert and didn‚Äôt want to cause her anxiety to go any higher.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Rio put a plate in the dishwasher, kissed Agatha on the cheek, and followed Nat. Wanda and Agatha exchanged looks as the other two women walked out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once they were out of earshot, Nat turned and held up Rio‚Äôs phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI cloned your phone so I could keep track of SF,‚Äù Nat said quietly as she handed it back to the wide-eyed woman. Rio hadn‚Äôt even known Nat took it in the first place. ‚ÄúBefore you even say anything, why didn‚Äôt you say anything earlier, before the flowers?‚Äù Nat seemed more concerned than mad.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI thought I could handle it, or that she would just give up,‚Äù Rio said meekly, "I know she‚Äôs not the most stable, but I didn‚Äôt think she would fly off the handle like this.‚Äù Rio‚Äôs voice went even quieter, and Natasha had to lean in so she could hear her. ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd actually hurt me in any way. It was Shane who did that, hurt me, not her. Never Lou.‚Äù When she finished speaking, her voice was barely audible, and a fresh tear slid down her cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù Natasha stood. ‚ÄúYou still love her.‚Äù It was a statement, not a question.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged. ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt know. I am still processing it. It was a large part of my life that just fell apart so quickly.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Natasha nodded. She knew a thing or two about things happening quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTalk to Agatha. If you don‚Äôt tell her, I will. I‚Äôm not going to watch her get hurt‚Ä¶‚Äù Nat had to stop herself from adding ‚Äòagain‚Äô. She knew Agatha hadn‚Äôt told Rio about that, but she was ready to threaten Agatha, too. ‚Äú...and this would crush her if you don‚Äôt tell her now. Anyone in the state of California with eyes can see you two‚Ä¶care‚Ä¶about each other. Communicate. Please.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, gathering her composure. ‚ÄúI will. Tonight.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Everyone had left, and Rio thought about what Nat had said. She needed to come clean, and she knew that she couldn‚Äôt completely be with Agatha in any physical way until she told her about her emotional conflicts. Rio wordlessly took Agatha‚Äôs hand and led her to the couch, guiding her to sit so they could face each other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had noticed that Rio had been rather quiet since speaking with Nat in the hallway an hour ago, and Agatha had been worried. She put down her wine, taking Rio‚Äôs hands in hers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat is it, Rio? What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a shaky breath. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been lying to you, and I need to confess a few things.‚Äù The words tumbled out of her mouth, and they were not the ones she had rehearsed in her brain for the past forty-five minutes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha started replaying every conversation since they first met. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked down at the couch. ‚ÄúToday was not the first time SF texted me. It was actually a few weeks ago‚Ä¶‚Äù She told her about the warning to stay away from Agatha, the text about the stars, and the one from the night prior. ‚ÄúNat knows now and can now see everything that comes into my phone.‚Äù She could tell that Agatha was considering Rio‚Äôs words. She wasn‚Äôt mad but hurt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me?‚Äù Agatha ached at this, but at the same time, wasn‚Äôt she still harboring a giant secret? One that ate at her more and more by the day?¬† Although,¬† this could have caused harm to all of them, and still could. She pushed her hurt aside, knowing it was a small penance for keeping her secrets tight to her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio curled into herself, wrapping her arms around her knees, trying to make herself as small as she felt. She hated having to admit these feelings to Agatha. She didn‚Äôt want to have them for anyone but Agatha. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think she would do anything, Agatha. L‚Ä¶SF had never hurt me, physically. Had never hurt anyone I was close to. I didn‚Äôt think she had completely lost it, didn‚Äôt want to believe it. It was her ex-husband that hurt me. And then, Alice was with me, there was the order, no contact‚Ä¶.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Another tear escaped the war behind her eyes as her voice died out. She couldn‚Äôt bring herself to look at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt like a fist had closed around her heart. She knew what Rio was saying without her actually saying it, and Agatha was trying her best not to crumble. ‚ÄúRio,‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs voice shook, ‚Äúhow do you feel about her?‚Äù Agatha had to know if Rio was still in love with her. She had just finally gotten Rio, that fucking morning. Now, here they were with Rio about to tell her she may still be in love with another woman.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio winced. Agatha‚Äôs voice was too shaky, yet too strong at the same time. ‚ÄúYou have to understand everything that happened,‚Äù Rio started, ‚ÄúI found out on Christmas Day that things were absolutely not over between her and the hubby, and they most likely never would be. I stormed out of the house and out of her life. We had been talking about our future that morning. A secret marriage, leaving the country, her retiring, very Evelyn Hugo, when she got a phone call from him, and you would think I hadn‚Äôt even existed. Like we hadn‚Äôt spent the entire morning making love and talking about our plans, so I made up my mind and left. Alice came to town that day and found me sobbing.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha realized that their pasts weren‚Äôt that dissimilar, this would be the perfect time to divulge her own past, but this moment wasn‚Äôt about her. She waited patiently until Rio inhaled deeply, ready to go on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhen she realized I was serious, the texts, gifts, pictures, the whole stalking thing started. When she broke into my house in February, I had to get a temporary order, and you know the rest. I never got closure, Agatha. We were never able to discuss everything. One minute, we were talking marriage and‚Ä¶well, it doesn‚Äôt matter, but then we were over. She was the first woman I thought I could spend the rest of my life with, and then it was over.‚Äù Rio had stopped crying, and she found that she was angry more than anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hadn‚Äôt answered her question, and Agatha still needed the answer. She untangled Rio‚Äôs hands from her knees, tipped her chin, and locked eyes. She had to be able to see Rio‚Äôs eyes when she finally got her answer. ‚ÄúRio, now that I understand everything. How do you feel?‚Äù She asked again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       in
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      love with her. I don‚Äôt want to
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       be
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      with her. I meant it when I said I want to be with you, Agatha. I care about
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       you
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      deeply. I
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       choose
      </span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
       you,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was the truth. Did part of her love Lou? Yes, but it was more of a mourning of a sudden loss than anything. She was Agatha‚Äôs, and all the crazy in the world wasn‚Äôt going to change that. She grabbed Agatha by the collar of her shirt and brought her in for a searing kiss, a proclamation, and a promise, the taste of salt from tears mixed in with hot breath, moans, and teeth. Agatha shifted and kissed away Rio‚Äôs tears before leaning back slightly. ‚ÄúRio?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù She answered, her lips swollen, trying to chase Agatha‚Äôs mouth to continue what they were doing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, Rio, be serious.‚Äù She said in a slightly more commanding tone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned back and tried to focus.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPlease stop keeping things from me,‚Äù The hypocrisy was not lost on Agatha, but this wasn‚Äôt about her. ‚ÄúYou can tell me anything. If we‚Äôre going to do this, we have to be honest and communicate with each other,‚Äù she realized she wasn‚Äôt applying this same logic to herself. However, she hadn‚Äôt survived this long in the industry by being honest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, ‚ÄúYes. Thank you for being patient with me. I know this is a lot.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed her again, ‚ÄúI will always choose you, too.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat back, wiping at her eyes. ‚ÄúOne minute! If you‚Äôre going to do this, so am I.‚Äù She pulled up her socials, as some people had already found her throughout the day since she had ‚Äòliked‚Äô Agatha‚Äôs posts. ‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù she turned so she was in front of Agatha and took a selfie of them, Rio‚Äôs back pressed against the front of Agatha, Rio kissing Agatha‚Äôs cheek, Agatha looking down at her and smiling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPerfect!‚Äù She posted it with the caption. ‚ÄòSo thankful for the woman I call my girlfriend! Happy Thanksgiving!‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grinned. ‚ÄúI really like the sound of that, by the way,‚Äù as she kissed Rio again, slowly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was then that Natasha barrelled through the door. ‚ÄúAlice‚Äôs, NOW.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou sat in Alice Wu-Gulliver‚Äôs darkened apartment. The restraining order only covered Rio‚Äôs physical location and apartment, not Alice‚Äôs. Surely, Lou could speak to Alice and tell her how she felt about Rio. If anyone could talk sense into her beautiful Rio, it was Alice. Lou couldn‚Äôt believe the pictures the investigator had sent her that morning, and she hadn‚Äôt been able to get to LA quickly enough. Agatha Harkness was obviously bad for Rio. She was a known fuck boi, Lou knew that personally. So what if Agatha was slowing down in her old age? She was using Rio. Probably for better grades for her son or something. Rio was better and out of Agatha‚Äôs league. Rio belonged to Lou and only Lou. She had thought about cat-napping that incessant beast of Rio‚Äôs, but that was the one thing she would never forgive. Crow? Finch? Whatever bird the damn thing was named after meant the world to Rio. Lou hated cats, and the foul thing hated Lou.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maybe, if this didn‚Äôt work out, she could make it look like Agatha poisoned the damned thing. Rio would surely come back to Lou in that scenario. That was a thought. Rio would never love Agatha, then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou snapped out of her thoughts when she heard a key turn. It was about damn time. Why did everyone spend so much time at that damn compound anyway?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt see why you can‚Äôt tell me who the psychotic bitch is, honey,‚Äù Jen said to Alice as they walked in the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs,‚Äù she flipped on the lights, and her eyes automatically landed on the blonde model sitting on her couch. ‚ÄúLou,‚Äù she finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSee,‚Äù Jen laughed, ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt so hard,‚Äù it was then that Jen‚Äôs eyes also landed on the woman, her mouth forming an ‚Äòo‚Äô. ‚ÄúLou Falco? Oh shit. Rio does have a type.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time, Alice,‚Äù Lou said, not bothering to get up. She turned her head to Jen, ‚ÄúYou must be the infamous Jennifer Kale, charmed, I‚Äôm sure,‚Äù she looked back to Alice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here about Rio.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou heartless bitch. Leave her alone. She was healing. She was finally moving on from you.‚Äù Alice was furious as she stalked towards where Lou was on the couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou sighed, ‚ÄúOh Alice, don‚Äôt you see I‚Äôm here because I love her? I need you to see that so you can tell her so and talk sense into her. Agatha doesn‚Äôt love her. Not like I do. Agatha will just fuck and forget her like she does every other woman.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou hid her, Lou. Lied to her. Your husband almost killed her. If he had still been in his prime, he would have. You USED her, Lou. Not Agatha.‚Äù Alice may have been smaller, but she was ready to kill to protect one of her coven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had quietly taken a picture and sent it to Nat, and was now discreetly recording the entire thing. She made sure her phone was on silent so if Nat texted back, Lou wouldn‚Äôt be alerted. Jen wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this lunatic were armed. She stepped forward and put an arm around Alice‚Äôs waist.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know who you are, and I can destroy your entire career.‚Äù Jen spat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúPlease, I‚Äôd give it all up for Rio.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice cackled, ‚ÄúRight. If you were willing to do that, you‚Äôd have done it already. You‚Äôll do what you always do: promise her the world, make her come back, and then crush her heart. You do it every fucking time. If you did love her, you‚Äôd let her go. You‚Äôd let her be happy. AGATHA makes her happy. She was NEVER that happy with you. She‚Äôs always smiling now, Lou. She doesn‚Äôt call me in tears anymore. She doesn‚Äôt call me because she saw Agatha on someone else‚Äôs arm. Do you know why? Because she‚Äôs the one on Agatha‚Äôs arm. Agatha Fucking Harkness, who infamously NEVER takes anyone to anything, has and will take Rio to EVERYTHING, Lou. You were afraid to be seen in public with her. Even as a fucking friend unless it was as a group. Even that only happened a handful of times in TWO YEARS. They‚Äôve been friends for FOUR months.‚Äù Alice was breathing like she‚Äôd been in a boxing match.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou‚Äôs phone went off and when she checked it, her face went pale. Though Rio had blocked her on all of her socials, Lou followed her anyway on burner accounts. The notification was a post from Rio. A declaration and commitment to Agatha. After the lengths Lou had gone through for her today, Rio was making the relationship public now and even posted a picture.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice raised an eyebrow and checked her phone since she received a similar notification. She smiled and handed her phone to Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLooks like she chose Agatha over you,‚Äù Jen smirked, ‚ÄúDo you get it now? She doesn‚Äôt love you, Falco,‚Äù Jen was choosing her words carefully, the phone still inconspicuously filming.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs clearly been brainwashed,‚Äù she scoffed but turned eager once more. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt over. I was hoping you could help me, Alice. You were always the one to help my sweet Rio make decisions when she was confused about her emotions.‚Äù Lou stood and started towards the door, pulling a hood over her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, I usually told her to leave you.‚Äù Alice moved out of the way before Lou could even brush against her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI assume Agatha has at least one goon on the way.‚Äù She eyed Jen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be taking my leave.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen knew Lou‚Äôs reputation and made sure to have a grip on her phone as Lou made to leave when Alice had an idea. It was a bad one, but it was an idea.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio‚Äôs coming with them.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou stopped, ‚ÄúShe is?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen nodded in agreement. ‚ÄúYes, now‚Äôs your chance.‚Äù Natasha had texted back that all four of them were on the way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou looked around. She was cornered here, it wasn‚Äôt a good idea. She could make her escape if she met them outside though. She kept walking and easily slipped by both women and out the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at Alice, ‚ÄúDo we go after her?‚Äù She asked her girlfriend. Alice just nodded. She already had her hand on the doorknob.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice saw the door to the stairs close and nodded to the elevator. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to meet them outside. She‚Äôs done this before. Let Nat know.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The four women had just exited the vehicle in the parking garage as Nat read the text from Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs on her way out here,‚Äù She turned to Agatha and Rio. ‚ÄúAggie, you should get her out of here.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù She gripped Agatha‚Äôs hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was ready to tear this SF bitch limb from limb herself. She knew the threat to her family and her happiness this woman posed and she was ready to do what she needed to do.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou are to stay back,‚Äù Nat said, putting both hands on Wanda‚Äôs shoulders. Wanda opened her mouth to protest as Nat kissed her, just in case something went wrong.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNu. Te iubesc,‚Äù Nat added in Romani, Wanda‚Äôs first language.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       No, I love you.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYA tozhe tebya lyublyu,‚Äù Wanda said in Russian.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I love you too.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They turned their heads as they heard Jen and Alice‚Äôs footsteps hurry towards them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not here yet?‚Äù Alice looked around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI recorded everything,‚Äù Jen told Nat as she turned to Rio. ‚ÄúYou need to hear it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. Everyone stilled when they heard running. Jen turned her phone on to record as Nat motioned for Wanda, Alice, and Jen to get back in between the vehicles.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat, Agatha, and Rio stepped out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou came into view, slowing her steps, taking in the three women. Agatha and the pretty goon weren‚Äôt her concern. It was her beautiful Rio that she had her eyes on. She knew she only had a few minutes. She had told her own personal bodyguard to drive through here like a bat out of hell in five minutes, shooting if need be. Agatha, that cad, had her arms around Rio. Didn‚Äôt that movie star whore know that Rio belonged to Lou?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, love, I came for you.‚Äù Lou smiled as she approached.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tightened her grip on Rio as she got a look at the woman coming close to her. She knew it was Lou Falco, but she looked more familiar than that as if she had seen her recently. Maybe in an ad or a commercial or something? ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs close enough Lou.‚Äù She said firmly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt your business, Harkness.‚Äù Lou barked. ‚ÄúThis is between my fianc√©e and I.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs eyebrows flew up as she loosened her arms and looked at Rio. Nat didn‚Äôt flinch. She knew this was a tactic when she heard Alice hiss at Wanda and Jen that Lou was lying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou never proposed. You just made promises you never planned on keeping,‚Äù Rio said, voice steady. She laced Agatha‚Äôs fingers through her own. ‚ÄúStop pursuing me, Lou.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou grinned threateningly, ‚ÄúBut I love you, and you‚Äôre mine.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs her own person!‚Äù Agatha shouted. She hated when people thought they owned others. Yes, you could ‚Äòbelong‚Äô to someone if you chose to do so, but you were still your own person first.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou was closing in fast and reached towards Rio, who stepped into Agatha at the same time Agatha pulled Rio into her and in between their SUV and another car, knowing Nat was going to take over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Takeover Nat did. She slammed Lou to the ground with the full force of her body as she slammed a fist into her left cheek. She was just getting started when she heard tires screeching. Nat dove away from Lou and heard the slam of car doors and tires screech away. She waited a moment before jumping up and running to Wanda first, helping her up as she ran her hands over her and covered her in kisses. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù Nat asked as she checked for even the smallest scratch while Wanda laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBaby, all I did was watch.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, I was worried.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fine too, by the way,‚Äù Jen said, pulling Alice up and waving her phone slightly. ‚ÄúEverything was recorded.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had gently helped Rio to her feet, lightly caressing her face, arms, and shoulders. If she could have caressed her heart and mind, she would have. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs over,‚Äù Rio whispered as she hugged Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know, sweetheart, I know.‚Äù Agatha held her while looking at the other women. She was ready for the fight of her life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Someone had poked the bear inside of Agatha, and she was ready to maim.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat had left the next morning and gone to Connecticut, straight to Shane Falco, Lou‚Äôs ex-husband. He walked into his office at ESPN to find Nat with an envelope and an offer. He could choose to have full custody of his children and file charges against his wife for child endangerment, forcing a psychological evaluation and hospitalization, or Nat could expose the bribery from Falco over what had happened last spring with Rio. She filled him in on the last twenty-four hours and the actual story of his ex-wife‚Äôs actions. Nat was not one to use someone‚Äôs mental health against them, but this was a different story.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The way Lou spun the ‚Äòsituation‚Äô, as Shane called it, with Rio was much different than what had really happened. Lou had lied about the entire relationship to Shane. He had finally divorced Lou after seeing holes in her story. He feared for their three kids and was generally concerned about Rio‚Äôs safety, as well as apologetic about what he had done.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He wasn‚Äôt a bad guy, Nat thought, but another victim of Lou‚Äôs manipulation. By Monday, he had the kids, and Lou was admitted against her will. That was taken care of, at least temporarily. Rio hadn‚Äôt wanted her name involved or any connection to Agatha, so it was only a matter of time before Lou‚Äôs return.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha still had increased security, warned the school, and had bodyguards assigned to everyone. She didn‚Äôt care where Lou was. If she wasn‚Äôt six feet in the ground or scattered across the earth, she didn‚Äôt trust it.
     </span>

<span>
      The comments about Agatha and Rio being an official couple had been mostly positive. Jen had given an official statement to a few of her magazines of choice over the next few days about how Agatha and Rio were just taking it slowly and seeing where things led. With Rio posting from her personal socials, her last name had leaked, and they now had two hashtags, and the internet had gone wild.

      ‚ÄúI heard a rumor that Jennifer Kale is dating Lorna Wu‚Äôs daughter, Alice.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúCan you imagine Thanksgiving at Agatha‚Äôs?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI wonder what Nicky calls Rio?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha and Rio could cure my mommy issues AND my teacher issues.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was glad the attention was off of Wanda, for now, but didn‚Äôt like the spotlight and pressure being on Rio. She didn‚Äôt mind sharing the spotlight. She just didn‚Äôt want Rio to have any added stress. Rio just shrugged it off. As long as she didn‚Äôt have a crazy stalker, she was fine. Agatha knew they would receive a lot of attention in Vancouver, being in the VIP tent. She would have to talk to Jen about media training for Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      First up, however, was Billy‚Äôs musical at SHIELD. He had been preparing for it all semester, and theater was understandably a big deal at SHIELD. Productions were always a major event and close to Broadway caliber. Billy looked great in his Beetlejuice costume, and the other two boys had quick cameos as dead football players. The adults took their seats, and while Rio knew that Lou couldn‚Äôt hurt her at the moment, she didn‚Äôt completely trust it and kept glancing around. The middle and high schoolers were amazing, and Billy had performed his heart out, proving that he was very much a Maximoff.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was finally Saturday morning and time for Vancouver and the Taylor Swift concert on Sunday. Rio was filled with excitement as she and Agatha got to their hotel suite.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre okay with your son having a room with two other teenage boys?‚Äù Rio raised an eyebrow as she looked at her girlfriend. ‚ÄúThere is a spare room in here he could have.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo one is sharing a room with us.‚Äù Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio as she brought her in for a kiss. ‚ÄúI plan to do a lot of this.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚ÄúI approve of this plan.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs eyes flew open as she remembered something. She walked briskly to her suitcase and fished out a new pack of scrunchies. ‚ÄúLook! No one will bother us!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a cackle. ‚ÄúBrilliant. We can put them on the doorknob just so everyone leaves us alone,‚Äù Rio teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat would allow us to sleep in,‚Äù Agatha wrapped her arms back around Rio‚Äôs waist.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWatch the movies we want to watch.‚Äù Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha‚Äôs shoulders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGet dressed in peace.‚Äù Agatha kissed Rio gently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was a knock on the door, followed by Nicky‚Äôs voice, ‚ÄúMom! Dad! We‚Äôre hungry!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha dropped her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHe has his own fucking credit card. I‚Äôm going to murder him.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stomped to the door like a petulant teen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had all gathered in the main room of Agatha and Rio‚Äôs suite for movie night to watch the Christmas classic, Die Hard. The boys and Vision sprawled on the floor, Nat and Wanda on one end of the couch, Jen and Alice on a loveseat, and Agatha and Rio on the other end of the couch. Agatha and Rio were the last two awake as Hans Gruber fell to his death.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis and The Muppet‚Äôs Christmas Carol are the best Christmas movies,‚Äù Agatha stated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBad Mom‚Äôs Christmas. I love you in that movie,‚Äù Rio added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou would,‚Äù Agatha smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat? Like you said, I have a type.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYeah, famous older women with a penchant for breaking the law,‚Äù Agatha said as she kissed her cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAt least I‚Äôm consistent!‚Äù Rio got up and headed to their bedroom. ‚ÄòTheir bedroom‚Äô. Even if it was just for two nights at a hotel, she could get used to that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha followed her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm consistent! Attractive, breathing, with a pulse. That‚Äôs consistent.‚Äù She teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio settled in the middle of the bed, ‚ÄúYou sure do know how to make a gal feel special.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha settled beside Rio, tipping her face up so their eyes met.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, did I ever date before?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head in reply.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYOU are my type. Intelligent, sassy, kind, caring, beautiful, honest‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha punctuated each adjective with a kiss as Rio smiled. Agatha was being honest, even if she was still holding back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tightened her hold on Agatha as she kissed her back, hands tangled in Agatha‚Äôs hair. Rio knew she had fallen for Agatha but refused to admit it. She was Agatha‚Äôs, and if everyone hadn‚Äôt been asleep one room over like a sleepover, she would show her as much. Instead, she sighed frustratedly as she assumed her now familiar sleep position.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe have got to set firmer boundaries in this family,‚Äù Rio murmured mostly to herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgreed,‚Äù Agatha whispered into her hair as she trailed her fingers up and down Rio‚Äôs back before they fell asleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was Taylor Swift Day, and Rio was floating. She had seen the Eras tour in 2023, but this was different. This was the VERY LAST SHOW and she was with AGATHA FUCKING HARKNESS. Her friends, too, but mainly Agatha. Her girlfriend. Rio still pinched herself on occasion to make sure this was her reality. They were all covered in glitter and dressed in various costumes and outfits. Nicky was dressed as a lime green dog, Tommy as a black one, and Billy wore a shirt that said ‚ÄòWide-Eyed Gays‚Äô.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There were several VIP tents, and they exchanged friendship bracelets with different people and sang along with Gracie Abrams, waiting for Taylor to come on, and screaming when she did, in all of her tangerine body suit glory.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI need those boots!‚Äù Agatha yelled into Rio‚Äôs ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAny and every one of those bodysuits would look amazing on you,‚Äù Rio yelled back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They all sang, yelled, screamed, and danced along for three and a half hours. There were tears and sobbing to Taylor‚Äôs speeches as well. They had all screamed the line ‚Äòshade never made anybody less gay‚Äô during ‚ÄúYou Need To Calm Down‚Äù and Wanda had taken a lot of pictures of everyone. Agatha had told Rio that Wanda and Nat tended to get carried away at concerts and to cover them if it looked like they might. She felt justified when they watched Nat look deeply into Wanda‚Äôs eyes singing the line ‚Äòmarry me Juliet‚Äô, but grateful that Vision and the boys formed a wall around them. Rio and Agatha both sang ‚ÄúWe Are Never Getting Back Together‚Äù at the top of their lungs. When Rio asked Agatha why she was feeling the song so hard, she said she just liked it a lot, with a shrug. Agatha knew it was because that one relationship she had been in had been on and off again for so long, though Agatha wasn‚Äôt going to tell Rio here. It was also why ‚ÄòAll Too Well‚Äô hit so hard, especially the age gap it referenced. Agatha had been the younger woman and it had hurt a lot, being in such different places in their lives.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was during Enchanted, though when Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio, and they sang to each other without even realizing it. Agatha noticed how true the lyrics rang for her. She remembered when she asked Lilia if Rio was single immediately the day they met at the fieldhouse. And how she hadn‚Äôt wanted the night to end the first time Rio had come back to her house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took more pictures with Nat‚Äôs arm around her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sang ‚ÄúLook What You Made Me Do‚Äù with a vengeance and then every Folkmore song with her whole chest. Agatha loved how passionate Rio was about music, and how much she got into it. She could tell how elated Rio was as she leaned in to steal a kiss during ‚ÄúBetty‚Äù.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When ‚ÄúIllicit Affairs‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy Tears Ricochet‚Äù came on, Agatha sang with emotion from deep within. The line ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me kid, don‚Äôt call me baby‚Äù reminded Agatha of how those terms would ring in her ear with a mocking tone, hurting her more and more. Now, every time Rio called Agatha ‚Äòbaby,‚Äô it erased a memory of that, mending the scars with love and care. She was carried on those emotional waves through ‚ÄúMy Tears Ricochet‚Äù, each lyric feeling like she was tossing another shovel full of dirt on the past and screaming for freedom at the sky.¬† At a couple of points, she caught Rio glancing at her with curiosity. She hoped Rio wouldn‚Äôt ask her about them later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The mood shifted when ‚ÄúMarjorie‚Äù started. Agatha knew that Rio and Alice were thinking about Gran, as she saw them sing and sob together. Then, ‚ÄúWillow‚Äù brought out the witch in all of them, and they danced through the 1989 era like they were trying to cast a spell.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The music kept them bouncing and singing. At one point, Rio turned and gestured to Agatha as she sang, ‚ÄòI can make the bad boys good for the weekend,‚Äô and Agatha laughed with pure happiness. Lastly, they all screamed along to Bad Blood, remembering the events of Thanksgiving and how Lou nearly ruined their day.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio squealed with delight at the appearance of the The Tortured Poet‚Äôs Department set. The last Eras Tour show Rio had attended didn‚Äôt have it.¬† Despite being sweaty and exhausted, the euphoria and adrenaline fueled her partying. Billy was also having the time of his life. When his current favorite ‚ÄòBut Daddy I Love Him‚Äô started, he FaceTimed Eddie so they could sing together. The young love made Agatha smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs Afraid of Little Old Me?‚Äô was another group favorite. Agatha felt as if she had grown up in an asylum, it had definitely felt like a circus. She still had a bite left in her bark, though.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It amused Agatha when she and Rio both changed the pronouns of ‚ÄúThe Smallest (wo)Man Who Ever Lived‚Äù.. Agatha felt her eyebrows rise when Rio screamed it. She must have been channeling all of her feelings about a certain blonde and it was healing for her. If she had been honest with herself, Agatha would have admitted it was cathartic for her as well. The song drew on memories of both her mother and her ex. Her mother, who had literally sent someone to kill her. And her ex, who had destroyed her and truly ruined a few sparkling summers. Despite the memories and suppressed heartbreak that tried to bubble up, Agatha made sure her facial expressions didn‚Äôt give anything away. She didn‚Äôt think Rio had noticed anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But then, Taylor started ‚ÄúI Can Do It With A Broken Heart.‚Äù This song reverberated in the depths of her soul, reflecting the most intimate and painful moments from her youth. Not that Rio knew any of that story.¬† The story of when someone had told Agatha they would love her for their whole life, and then they very much did not. She wondered if Rio related to the song as much as she did. Or Wanda, for that matter, who returned to her sight at that moment. Wanda had taken Nat‚Äôs hand as she and Agatha both yelled, ‚ÄòTRY TO COME FOR MY JOB‚Äô at the same time, causing them to giggle afterward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When it was time for the acoustic songs, Taylor had changed into the pink and orange dress they were all hoping she would wear as she spoke about it being the last show before playing A Place In This World mashed with New Romantics. They all cried at the Long Live/New Year‚Äôs Day/The Manuscript mashup, especially when she added the ‚Äòend of an era‚Äô lyric. ‚ÄòI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you‚Äô had a special meaning to all of them, and Agatha leaned into Rio and whispered, ‚ÄòI want your midnights‚Äô in her ear. When Rio looked into Agatha‚Äôs eyes and said, ‚ÄúNever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere,‚Äù Agatha felt the weight of the implied permanence. Permanence she could handle. It was the depth of feeling she didn‚Äôt want to admit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Still, Agatha shook her head and replied, ‚ÄúNever,‚Äù before kissing Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky made a gagging sound behind them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Taylor dove into the stage and swam off, going into ‚ÄòLavender Haze‚Äô. During ‚ÄòVigilante Shit‚Äô the coven exchanged looks and tried not to laugh. ‚ÄòMastermind‚Äô was an Agatha Harkness anthem, if there ever was one, ‚Äúif you fail to plan, you plan to fail‚Äù. Agatha had a carefully constructed plan for nearly everything. She had a Jen, a Natasha, and teams of people. It was something she had learned long ago. She noticed that Rio was analyzing her as they sang. During the final song, ‚ÄòKarma‚Äô, the boys, Vision, Nat, and Rio, all yelled, ‚Äògirl on the screen coming home to me‚Äô. Vision laughed as he and the boys covered Wanda and Nat so they could kiss without being photographed like they were all those years ago. Jen and Alice just enjoyed the fact that they could do what they wanted, and no one paid attention to them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After the show, Agatha led them all backstage, where they met Taylor, who hugged them all! Rio‚Äôs brain buzzed as she looked at the energetic musician, it was completely unfair that someone the same age as her had just done all of that and still looked unphased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou must be Rio! It‚Äôs great to meet you!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Taylor Swift knew who she was!
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      If she didn‚Äôt have plans for the rest of the night, Rio could die happy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me. Great to meet you as well. You were amazing,‚Äù She was used to big stars by now, but to her, this was different.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They chatted for a moment and Rio learned that Agatha and Wanda were friends with Taylor. Alice had been holding out on that information, but that explained the fantastic tickets they had last year and for the Reputation tour when she thought about it. They took pictures on all of their phones and Taylor made Agatha and Wanda both promise to post them on their socials and she would post on hers as well for her wrap-up. Taylor had even exchanged numbers with Rio, asked the boys about school and dating, and was thrilled to hear about the updates with Jen and Alice, as well as Wanda and Nat. Of course, Taylor Fucking Swift knew what was going on with Wanda and Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Definitely one of the best days of her life, she thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had all dozed on their way back to the hotel and departed to their separate rooms upon arrival. Rio was wide awake when they got to the suite, entering after Agatha and closing the door behind her. She had worn high-waisted jeans, a sheer long-sleeved white shirt with a black bra underneath, and now had a Taylor Swift T-shirt on over that. Agatha was wearing a black strapless jumpsuit that Rio had wanted to unzip all night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Their shoes and bags hit the floor as they walked through the suite and into the bedroom. Rio shut that door behind them as well, placing a scrunchie on both handles, unbeknownst to Agatha. She took Agatha‚Äôs hand and pulled Agatha into her. ‚ÄúThank you for tonight.‚Äù she breathed, sliding both hands around her waist and resting them on Agatha‚Äôs firm butt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha put a hand in Rio‚Äôs hair, gripping it lightly, fingernails barely scratching Rio‚Äôs scalp. She placed the other hand on Rio‚Äôs hip, nails slightly pressing through the fabric.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThank YOU for going with me, my beautiful girlfriend.‚Äù She pulled Rio toward her, sliding their lips together as Rio‚Äôs instantly parted for Agatha. Agatha moved her tongue against Rio‚Äôs hungrily, Rio felt all of the emotions from the past week crash into her at once as Agatha pulled Rio flush against her, wrapping an arm around her, the hand in her hair guided Rio‚Äôs head as Agatha kissed her. Rio returned the kiss just as passionately as her hands began to move, exploring the expanse of Agatha‚Äôs back and body. Agatha moved away and trailed kisses along Rio‚Äôs jawline and down her neck, finding her pulse point, and swirled her tongue around it, causing Rio to moan.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha,‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù Agatha asked as she continued kissing and licking her way down Rio‚Äôs neck to her collarbone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTake me to bed,‚Äù Rio commanded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew this was typically the point at which she had been putting a stop to things. Tonight, she had other plans. It wasn‚Äôt about the concert. It was about being ready. Both her heart and her body told her, she was definitely ready. Agatha broke from Rio‚Äôs neck and looked into her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚ÄúYes, Agatha.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs eyes were soft, full of warmth and care, something else that Rio was too afraid to name.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGladly.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed her again as she led Rio to the bed. Agatha took the hem of Rio‚Äôs T-shirt and tugged it over her head and dropped it to the ground. She went to do the same with the sheer shirt when Rio stopped Agatha‚Äôs hands and shook her head with a sly smile. Rio kissed Agatha again before spinning her around, sweeping Agatha‚Äôs long hair over her shoulder, unzipping the jumpsuit, following the zipper with kisses while she went, making quick work of the purple strapless bra, flinging it off to the side.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI thought I was taking YOU to bed,‚Äù Agatha said softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShut up Harkness,‚Äù Rio licked a long line up Agatha‚Äôs spine, as she slid the jumpsuit down and off Agatha. She ran her hands over the smooth planes of Agatha‚Äôs back, kissing the nape of her neck. Rio stepped back and gently hooked her thumbs in the sides of Agatha‚Äôs purple lacey hipsters and tugged them down, guiding her out of them and turning Agatha around so she could see her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio inhaled deeply when she saw Agatha, all of Agatha in front of her. She looked her over from head to toe and back again. She had seen Agatha on screens and in pictures, but never in person, only for her, like this. Unedited and unfiltered, just for Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, you‚Äôre beautiful.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She caressed Agatha‚Äôs cheek before kissing her again, softly, longingly, conveying things she couldn‚Äôt convey in words. A kiss that said
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I see you.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs eyes were closed as Rio kissed her. Agatha reached out again to take the hem of Rio‚Äôs shirt, only to have her hands slapped away. ‚ÄúDamnit Rio,‚Äù she started as she opened her eyes, but her eyes widened as Rio slowly took her shirt off herself, eyes locked with Agatha‚Äôs as if saying
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       let me bare my soul to you
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . She reached back to unhook her bra, drawing the straps down her arms, the bra sliding off and joining the growing pile of clothing on the floor.¬† She stripped away layer by layer, exposing herself to Agatha until nothing remained but Rio in her natural state. Agatha watched her reverently as Rio slowly unbuttoned the three buttons of her jeans before unzipping them. Rio hooked her thumbs in the sides of her jeans and her green boy shorts at the same time as she pulled them down, letting them fall and stepping out of them. As she stood back to her full height Rio was stopped by how Agatha was looking at her. As if she, Rio Vidal, was a goddess of myth standing in front of her and it was Agatha‚Äôs sole goal in life to worship Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre perfect, Rio‚Äù Agatha breathed, echoing an earlier lost moment. She stepped forward, pressing their bodies together, gasping at the feeling of skin against skin, her hands on Rio‚Äôs hips guiding her towards the bed, Agatha‚Äôs mouth working against Rio‚Äôs in a searing kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The back of Rio‚Äôs thighs hit the bed as Agatha lay Rio down and guided her to where she wanted her. Rio‚Äôs body was on fire everywhere Agatha was pressed against it, and her need was already apparent. Rio wanted to take her time, revel in this, and spend the night exploring each other. She was also impatient and they had barely touched each other. Rio‚Äôs hands were in Agatha‚Äôs hair, down her shoulders, tracing the muscles of her back, wherever she could touch. Rio finally had full access to this woman and she didn‚Äôt know where to focus first. Rio tried to roll them over, only for Agatha to press Rio‚Äôs shoulder back into the bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Agatha growled in Rio‚Äôs ear, as she bit the side of Rio‚Äôs neck and then sucked. Rio whined in response, flexing her fingers into Agatha‚Äôs shoulders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha propped herself to hover above Rio, and ran the back of one hand down Rio‚Äôs left side, leaving goosebumps in her wake. She kissed, licked, and nipped down Rio‚Äôs neck and chest to her right breast, dragging the flat of her tongue against the hardened nipple, causing Rio to moan. Agatha ran her left hand to the opposite breast, rolling the nipple between her thumb and forefinger, finding a matching rhythm between her hand and mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio moaned, her need growing. She scratched up and down the parts of Agatha‚Äôs back she could reach. Rio had always been sensitive, however, this was beyond that. Agatha instinctively knew exactly what Rio needed and wanted, the right amount of pressure, when to use her teeth, and when to pinch or pull. Rio rolled her hips, needing friction and finding none.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha,‚Äù Rio breathed, as she fisted a hand in Agatha‚Äôs hair and pulled Agatha‚Äôs head back from where she was creating a bruise in between Rio‚Äôs breasts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up with a wicked smile, ‚ÄúImpatient, beautiful?‚Äù she asked Rio as she moved up and kissed Rio before she could reply.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put a hand against Agatha‚Äôs cheek as she broke the kiss, giving Agatha a wicked smile of her own and said, ‚ÄúAgatha, if you don‚Äôt touch‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The words died on her lips as she saw the same want and need mirrored in Agatha‚Äôs eyes that Rio felt in her soul. It wasn‚Äôt just about sex, it was about the emotions neither of them planned to admit or confront anytime soon, and just seeing it was enough for Rio. She threaded both hands in Agatha‚Äôs hair and kissed her hard, teeth clacking, tongues clashing. Agatha used a knee to nudge Rio‚Äôs legs apart as her hand ghosted down Rio‚Äôs body, between her breasts, over her stomach, around and down her hip, on the outside of her thigh, and finally up the inside of her thigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had moved a hand to palm at one of Agatha‚Äôs full breasts, taking in the sighs and moans she elicited as she manipulated a nipple, appreciating Agatha‚Äôs body as Agatha did hers. Rio was writhing underneath Agatha as her hand got closer to where Rio was waiting for her, dripping as Agatha‚Äôs fingers lightly brushed over her. Rio whimpered, ‚ÄúBaby, please, I need you,‚Äù she pleaded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed down to her ear and whispered, ‚ÄúAnything for you,‚Äù as she slid a finger up her slit before drawing tight circles around Rio‚Äôs already-hardened clit. Rio let out a long, low moan, moving one hand to scratch up and down Agatha‚Äôs back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo wet for me already,‚Äù Agatha flicked her tongue along the shell of Rio‚Äôs ear as she quickened her movements, to Rio‚Äôs delight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio bucked her hips more, feeling her muscles tighten as she dragged her nails up and down Agatha‚Äôs back, focusing on the orgasm that was quickly building in her, Agatha‚Äôs mouth was back on hers as she swallowed every sound that came from Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio whimpered as she was on the brink, Agatha was putting just the right amount of pressure on her clit when Agatha‚Äôs thumb quickly replaced her fingers on Rio‚Äôs clit, and two fingers sank deep inside of her. Rio cried out at the sudden sensation and dug nails into Agatha‚Äôs back as her muscles clenched around Agatha‚Äôs fingers. Agatha thrust hard and fast, curling her fingers forward each time to hit Rio‚Äôs front wall. Rio clung to Agatha as she screamed out Agatha‚Äôs name and came around her hand. Agatha worked Rio through her climax before withdrawing, kissing Rio slowly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took Agatha‚Äôs hand by the wrist, breaking from Agatha‚Äôs kiss. She stared into Agatha's eyes as she licked up her palm, tasting the evidence of herself, before taking Agatha‚Äôs fingers between her lips and licking them clean, a smile on Agatha‚Äôs lips. As she finished her task, Agatha smirked, ‚ÄúGood girl.‚Äù She said as she kissed Rio, fresh evidence of where Rio had licked Agatha‚Äôs fingers still on Rio‚Äôs tongue, and Agatha moaned at the taste.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took the backs of Agatha‚Äôs thighs in her hands and began tugging her upwards. Rio loved the sensation of Agatha on top of her and now she needed her to sit someplace else entirely. Agatha looked at her again, an eyebrow raised in question. Rio darted her tongue across her bottom lip as she nodded. ‚ÄúAgatha, I want to taste you.‚Äù it was almost a whine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBut are you sure you want me to‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha was cut off when Rio crashed their lips together before biting Agatha‚Äôs bottom lip just enough that she winced with pleasure. Rio tugged at the back of¬† Agatha‚Äôs thighs again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúUp here now, Agatha,‚Äù she half commanded, half whined.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha crawled up the bed before she carefully settled a knee on either side of Rio‚Äôs head, slowly lowered herself onto Rio, and gripped the headboard.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio reached for Agatha‚Äôs waist and pulled her down so that mouth met labia, and Agatha sighed in satisfied relief as the tip of Rio‚Äôs tongue drew lines up and down through her slit. Agatha moaned as she matched Rio‚Äôs motions and met the pace, taking control. Rio had always considered herself to be dominant but for Agatha? She was putty in her hands, and she liked it. Rio flattened her tongue, increasing the pressure as Agatha increased her pace. She moved a hand to cup Agatha‚Äôs ass, digging her nails in, leaving half-moons in her pale skin. The other hand spread the lips at Agatha‚Äôs entrance, allowing her to swirl her tongue, teasing around the outside, before dipping it in as far as she could.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gasped at the shallow sensation, bucking against Rio‚Äôs nose.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew what Agatha wanted as she moved her tongue back and licked Agatha‚Äôs clit in one smooth, long, slow motion as Agatha moaned loudly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, Rio, fuck,‚Äù she let out as Rio began to alternate between circling the bundle of nerves and licking it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAs you wish.‚Äù She breathed against Agatha‚Äôs cunt, causing Agatha to grip the headboard even harder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew Agatha was dripping, the evidence on Rio‚Äôs chin. The older woman above her was more than ready when Rio pushed three fingers into her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRIO, GOD!‚Äù She yelled, as she kept one hand on the headboard and gripped the back of Rio‚Äôs head with the other, fucking Rio‚Äôs face and fingers as hard as she could, moans and curses tumbling from her lips. Rio matched her pace, thrusting hard as she wrapped her lips around Agatha‚Äôs clit and sucked. Agatha, came undone around her, her moans and screams quieting as Rio worked her through her climax before carefully removing her fingers and turning her face to kiss Agatha‚Äôs thigh, biting it and sucking a bruise there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked down at her, pupils blown, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio grinned, looking up at her. ‚ÄúSigning my work.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled and shook her head as she moved to lay beside Rio, kissing her and tasting herself on Rio‚Äôs lips. ‚ÄúYou think you did that good of a job, huh?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smirked, ‚ÄúYou were pretty loud, so yes.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGuilty,‚Äù Agatha ran her hand up Rio‚Äôs left side before propping herself up and feeling along her ribcage, finding the slightly puckered skin. She stretched across Rio‚Äôs body and kissed the scars there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs heart was in her throat, and it took her a moment to clear it and find her voice. She had just given herself over to Agatha, mind, body, and soul, and now Agatha was halfway on top of her, kissing the stab wounds from the attack.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAggie, what are you doing?‚Äù She whispered, trying to hold herself together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMaking a promise never to hurt you,‚Äù she said as she rose and looked Rio in the eyes, before softly kissing her. Rio held her as she kissed her back. This was unlike anything she had ever had before, and she knew it. She rolled them over, Agatha allowing her this time, as Rio propped herself up on her side and ran a hand to Agatha‚Äôs right hip, where she had noticed a tattoo on the front of her hipbone earlier. She traced her fingers over the heart with the three swords through it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe three of swords. Grief, heartbreak, sorrow,‚Äù Rio said, quoting
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The Witches‚Äô Road.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you had this, and I‚Äôve uh, seen a lot of things where you‚Äôre naked,‚Äù She blushed, looking at Agatha. They had just had sex, and she was blushing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled sweetly at her, she was being vulnerable with Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always had it covered with makeup or edited out,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been for me and me only, really. A reminder of what I‚Äôve been through in life.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio traced it with her fingers, ‚ÄúGrief and sorrow I get. Heartbreak?‚Äù She raised her eyebrow at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio asking her about heartbreak would have been the perfect time to tell her about that time of her life. Right after having sex, however, was not.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAll of those experiences being the heartbreak. My mother dying the way she did, watching Wanda go through what she has, knowing there was nothing I could do for Lorna, my childhood, everything. There‚Äôs a lot of heartbreak in this career.‚Äù It was another half-truth she could live with.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI never want to cause you any of those things, just be there for you if you have to face them,‚Äù Rio said seriously before kissing her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As tired as they were, they didn‚Äôt get much sleep that night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hadn‚Äôt been asleep for very long when her alarm went off at five that Monday morning following the concert. She and Rio had slept for maybe an hour. Their naked bodies pressed together. Agatha was wrong about wanting to wake up with Rio in her arms every morning. She wanted to wake up naked with Rio every morning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy is your alarm set?‚Äù Rio mumbled, mostly asleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGolden Globe nominations are being announced. Movies up first.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled back to throw something on and brush her teeth before going to the main area of their suite.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio followed her and kissed her with fresh peppermint breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha opened the door and entered the main room. Surprised no one was there, she turned back to Rio when she noticed the scrunchie on the handle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, did you put one of those on the other handle too?‚Äù Agatha asked, going back into the bedroom to retrieve their phones.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she yawned, going ahead and turning on the TV and finding the broadcast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As expected, Agatha had several texts with a picture of the door, asking if it was safe to come in so they could all watch the announcement broadcast together, an annual tradition. She texted the group chat, telling them it was safe to enter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about fucking time!‚Äù Wanda breezed in immediately after receiving the text, carrying several coffees in hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPun intended,‚Äù Nat added smirking, carrying more coffee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúCan we just ignore what happened in here last night?‚Äù Nicky asked as he carried in donuts he and the other two boys had gone and retrieved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPrepare yourselves to post on socials,‚Äù Jen looked at Agatha and Rio, ‚ÄúShower and look less‚Ä¶like that before posting any pictures, though.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The announcements started, and they ate donuts and drank their coffee as announcements were made.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Death‚Äôs Beloved
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Agatha was nominated for Best Lead Actress in a Drama, and was pissed as she turned towards Wanda, ‚ÄúYou deserve to be nominated too. We are BOTH the lead in the movie.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shook her head, ‚ÄúI have a better chance in the supporting actress category where I‚Äôm not up against you. I‚Äôve never won against you Agatha,‚Äù she looked at her best friend in admiration, not jealousy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha crossed her arms. ‚ÄúThat WILL change one day, superstar. You‚Äôre so much better than me.‚Äù Agatha gave her an adoring look. It wasn‚Äôt a competition, but if you asked Agatha, Wanda Maximoff was a thousand times the actress and woman Agatha was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As predicted, Wanda was nominated for supporting actress. Their director, screenplay, and score were all nominated. The song ‚ÄúMy Beloved‚Äù was nominated, ‚ÄúIf you win this, Aunt Aggie, you should win the Grammy,‚Äù Billy said excitedly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The film was also nominated for cinematic and box office achievement for the records they had broken, especially for being such a hit as a sapphic movie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Neither of them had TV shows they would be up for that year, so they turned the TV off, not interested in sitting through the rest of the list. Jen would bring them up to speed later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked around at everyone. ‚ÄúJanuary 5th for the Globes, so everyone begin working on what you‚Äôre wearing and who you‚Äôre walking the red carpet with.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once on the plane and headed back to LA, Agatha and Wanda made their celebratory posts about their nominations. Wanda took another group selfie of everyone and posted it along with:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMy family, related and chosen, are so grateful that all of you support me in what I do! Death‚Äôs Beloved has been one of the most amazing films I‚Äôve ever gotten to work on, and doing it with Agatha was so special! This is such an honor!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had also posted several pictures from the weekend in general. Very cute, very wholesome, very Wanda Maximoff.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha posted pictures from the concert, her and Rio with Taylor, the group with Taylor, just her and Rio, the group on the plane, and her and Rio on the plane.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis has been such a great weekend! Taylor, you were amazing, as always! We love you, and thank you so much for having us and the fam! Thank you to everyone out there for supporting Death‚Äôs Beloved the way you have! We led in nominations, and I am so humbled that I get to do the things I do! I love you all!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The internet had already been abuzz since last night it seemed, and Jen had already fired up her laptop, fingers flying. The boys were digging through everything they could find, and Nat was making sure there was nothing they didn‚Äôt want out there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha and Rio Get Cozy at Last Eras Stop‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWagatha and Friends Are Swifties!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWagatha‚Äôs Boys Are All Grown Up!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The story headlines themselves were fine. There were plenty of pictures of them all, especially shots looking into the tent, though it didn‚Äôt seem any pictures had been taken of Nat and Wanda. For that, they were thankful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio‚Äôs living a damn fairytale, and her Princess Charming is Agatha Harkness.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLook at them singing to each other!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha is in love with that woman.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYeah, and she‚Äôs in love right back.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTHEY‚ÄôRE IN LESBIANS!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúCHAT, my cousin was there, really close to the VIP tent. She said that Wanda and Nat kept being surrounded by Vision and the boys during ‚Äòromantic‚Äô times, and it looked like they were kissing.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Nat?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe main bodyguard!! She‚Äôs the hot redhead always following them!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh please, Wanda Maximoff is the straightest woman in the world.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha cackled from where she had been reading over Rio‚Äôs shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI think they both should have been nominated for lead! Homophobes.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIf we complain enough, we could still influence The Oscars.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The comments and articles went on as Rio put her phone down, leaning into Agatha. They would land soon, and she was exhausted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had been on the phone and turned to Alice crestfallen.¬† She removed the device from her ear and whispered in Alice‚Äôs ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Alice‚Äôs face fell, too, Nat spoke up. ¬† ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù She asked her two covenmates.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe deal on the house fell through,‚Äù Jen said as she took Alice‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been putting deals on houses, but we keep being outbid at ridiculous prices.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The whole mood of the plane had been brought down. Disappointment battled with previous euphoria. Agatha looked at Wanda, shared concern in their eyes. Wanda‚Äôs expression suddenly shifted, and Agatha knew immediately where her best friend‚Äôs mind had gone. Agatha nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Wanda began. ‚Äúwe have an idea.‚Äù
     </span>

      Jen had been looking at houses for the past year, knowing she wanted a bigger place. Something had told her she would eventually need the added space, and finally, dating Alice solidified it. Asking Alice to move in with her felt natural, but she didn‚Äôt think finding something in their flexible price range would be hard. They were being grossly outbid and refused to pay the outrageously inflated prices. Jen was becoming suspicious and didn‚Äôt want to play this game. Getting another phone call that their offer had fallen through didn‚Äôt exactly surprise her, and she was ready to make a voodoo doll of a very specific blonde model.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had always suspected that Wagatha was damn near telepathic, but watching their silent exchanges was still slightly unnerving. Wanda turned to Jen and Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe have an idea.‚Äù She had said, contemplating.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen threw up an eyebrow in question, though she had an idea she already knew.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBuild a house on the compound. There‚Äôs plenty of room.‚Äù Wanda finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWho the fuck are you, and what have you done with Agatha?‚Äù Jen turned to Agatha, eyebrow still raised. She loved Agatha, sure, but they tolerated each other the way you tolerated your older sister, whom you cleaned up after.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked. ‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt live right next door. You could even live further to the back of the property. We‚Äôre already clearing land for another house anyway. Either a guest house or if Vision wants to stay within the castle walls.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision‚Äôs head snapped up from where he had been helping Tommy with schoolwork, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre building a just-in-case house?‚Äù That was a complete surprise to him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Agatha, Wanda, and Nat all replied at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDarling, there‚Äôs a house near the compound I may be interested in, and it‚Äôs close enough for me. I am not a lesbian and do not feel the need to still live within 300 yards of my ex-wife.‚Äù Vision turned to look at Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll discuss it later?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision nodded as the twins looked at each other. Their parents, biological or otherwise, never argued in front of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked at everyone, ‚ÄúSo, one big happy, mostly queer, family compound?‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt going to add the
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       almost
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , though she had thought it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys had it covered, though, ‚ÄúJust missing two people and a cat.‚Äù Nicky mused with a sly grin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs eyes went wide. ‚ÄúUh, that is‚Ä¶not, we‚Äôre not even‚Ä¶‚Äù she stammered. These were inside thoughts for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha did her best to keep a blank face, looking at Rio next to her and then back to everyone else.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not there yet,‚Äù she stated simply.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda scoffed before adding, ‚ÄúOnce the divorce is finalized,‚Äù she looked over at Vision. ‚ÄúSorry, dear.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision just shrugged and waved it off. ‚ÄúNo need to apologize, Darling.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen, Nat will move in.‚Äù Wanda looked over at Nat, smiling brightly. She had waited to live with her again for twenty years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the plane began to descend in LA, the women discussed contractors while the boys continued to check the home network and various devices, employing the background bots and light hacking skills Nat had taught them how to use to monitor for any possible leaks and to delete what they could.

<p>
<span>
      Nat looked into the very suspicious bidding wars once they had returned home. She wasn‚Äôt sure how news was leaking to SF, but it was, and she didn‚Äôt like it. Nat didn‚Äôt like making people completely disappear, but she was beginning to think this was a safety issue, so she made a note to keep track of who actually bought the properties and who, if anyone, moved in. Nat was also closely monitoring the woman, who hadn‚Äôt been released yet, though she knew the model‚Äôs lawyers were working on it, and it was just a matter of time. The head of Wagatha, and coven, security had to make a decision, and quickly as Lou was slowly going after more than just Rio. Nat knew what this woman was doing, and it was psychological warfare.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Two could play that game, Nat thought, as she dialed a number to an old acquaintance. ‚ÄúYa sobirayu eto odolzhenye.‚Äù She spoke quickly in Russian.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I‚Äôm collecting on that favor.

</p>
<p>
<span>
      The fact that Lilia had let Alice and Rio off for two days that week had shocked Rio. How was it that all it took was a mention of Agatha, and the permission was granted? It was finals week, and the winter formal was on Saturday. There had been a few mutterings about favoritism, but they died quickly after Lilia popped into those specific classrooms. What this meant for the teachers of the coven was that they had to hit the ground running Wednesday morning and administer exams Wednesday and Thursday.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This was why, after having spent Monday and Tuesday with Agatha, Rio needed to go home. It was four in the afternoon, and she had to prepare for the next day. She had been home to check on Raven, but she knew her cat and knew she needed actually to be home.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were lying in Agatha‚Äôs bed, facing each other. Rio was twirling strands of Agatha‚Äôs hair around her fingers, and Agatha lightly traced her fingers over Rio‚Äôs scars.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAggie, I really need to head home.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI remember you saying that two hours ago,‚Äù Agatha smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI did, and then a very beautiful cougar of a woman pushed me against a wall, kissed me, and took me to her bed.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha clicked her tongue. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to watch out for those cougars. I hear they‚Äôre bad in these Hollywood hills,‚Äù Agatha moved forward and kissed Rio. ‚ÄúStay the night again?‚Äù She asked as she moved back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave a small smile. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt have everything for tomorrow, and I need to be home for Raven occasionally. Come over tonight? Nicky could stay with Wanda?‚Äù Rio countered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew that Nicky could stay by himself or with Wanda, but it was a school night, he had finals tomorrow, and routine was important. If only she could admit her feelings or be an adult about literally any of this. However, she could not. Instead, she found herself giving Rio a sad smile as she saw the disappointment in Rio‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, babe, it‚Äôs a school night, and I have to keep up the routine while I can. I film the next three days, and then we will film in Canada, starting a few days after the Globes and going for three weeks.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had completely forgotten about Canada. ‚ÄúWill you be in Canada the entire time?‚Äù Rio whispered, feeling preemptively sad. She knew she was being ridiculous.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be home Friday afternoon and leave out on Sunday evening. It‚Äôs just for three weeks. Disney reads start in May. Marvel things start shortly after that, and then they‚Äôll revolve around each other. For the TV show, we‚Äôll see if more episodes are ordered, but it premieres in March as a shortened season. I digress. I‚Äôll have more time off in February, but just a few weeks.‚Äù Agatha explained, steeling herself. They were starting to get to the difficult part of their relationship, Agatha‚Äôs job.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚ÄúWe have Winter and Spring breaks together, though, right?‚Äù she asked hopefully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled, ‚ÄúOf course. Now, before you leave me and I don‚Äôt see you until the weekend, come take a shower with me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once Rio had gotten home that evening, she had quite a bit to do to readjust to being home. She still had to unpack, clean out Raven‚Äôs feeder, and give the feline much-needed attention, chores, and all the things that had been neglected since Saturday. Alice had come over to oversee everything, and Rio had put her to work folding clothes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you and Jen going to go through with it? Build a house on the compound?‚Äù Rio asked from the kitchen as she prepped their lunches for the rest of the week.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe talked about it and decided it‚Äôs the best option. Her townhouse isn‚Äôt big enough for both of us. Hell, her bathroom is barely big enough for her skin routine.‚Äù Alice laughed at her girlfriend‚Äôs preferences. ‚ÄúWanda and Agatha are her only clients, so that makes sense. Then she‚Äôll still have her office for meetings with studio heads or if she needs a quieter space than the compound.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was disappointed that her best friend and sister would be moving out, though it would hopefully be months before it happened. The question she wanted to ask nagged at the back of her mind, and she knew she would find out eventually, so she might as well ask.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDid Nat?‚Äù She looked at Alice, not even finishing the rest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes. Bitch put in bids and drove prices up, but nothing had been finalized. Nothing else from there.‚Äù She kept her expressions neutral and her voice even. She didn‚Äôt want Rio to worry.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put the excess food containers in the refrigerator before turning off the light and joining Alice in the living room to take clothes to her bedroom to put away, Alice following her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThanks for your help, Alice.‚Äù She started, ‚ÄúAs for the problem, how did she know? How is she doing all this?‚Äù SF was still in some facility. It had been in news articles and tabloids that she had lost the kids and been ‚Äòsent to work on herself after a mental breakdown due to stress.‚Äô Different rumors were leaking, and the current plan was to ensure no one connected Rio to the supermodel.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shrugged, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what Jen and Nat are trying to find out.‚Äù Alice stretched out across Rio‚Äôs bed after helping her with all the chores. ‚ÄúRio?‚Äù Her voice had turned serious.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hung up the last piece of clothing and shut the closet door, lying down next to Alice. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù The tone of Rio‚Äôs voice matched Alice‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDo you still have all of Gran‚Äôs jewelry?‚Äù Alice turned her head to face Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was already turned toward Alice, a question on her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, why?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Gran died, Alice and Rio donated or sold almost everything, keeping only that which was sentimental or a family heirloom. Rio, being the more responsible of the two, stalker issue aside, had held on to the jewelry and had it in a safe with important documents.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice was trying to choose words carefully, as she wasn‚Äôt completely sure herself. ‚ÄúJust making sure is all,‚Äù she replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWait! Do you need the rings? Are you going to propose to Jen?‚Äù Rio asked excitedly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice huffed a laugh. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I just wanted to make sure we had them.‚Äù She chewed on the inside of her cheek. ‚ÄúI know I want to spend the rest of my life with her, whether that‚Äôs marriage or not. I often wonder what would have happened if I hadn‚Äôt been an idiot for a decade, where we would be by now. I never wanted kids. I have plenty of those at work, but we could have four dogs by now.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised her eyebrows as her forehead crinkled, ‚ÄúJennifer Kale does not seem like a dog person to me.‚Äù She thought for a moment. ‚ÄúWell, maybe one of those little yappy purse dogs.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice gave a small smile, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be surprised, dogs, cats, she likes to hike, not the primadonna everyone thinks she is. We all have layers, Ri.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know that. Everyone‚Äôs just full of surprises around here. Anyway, if you need Gran‚Äôs rings, I have them. Also, like I said before, let me know if you want me to wear a suit or a dress and if Agatha is the Best Man or not.‚Äù Rio grinned at the woman she considered her sister.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGood thing I love you, you ass. Speaking of love‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio cut her off with a groan. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start. I care about her, okay? Can we leave it at that? It‚Äôs been four and a half months. It‚Äôs too soon.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not, really. When you know, you know. You‚Äôre basing too many things off of she-who-must-not-be-named. Love doesn‚Äôt have an incubation period.‚Äù Alice had been looking at Rio seriously, trying to get the words to seep through her thick skull.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stared up at her ceiling fan and blew out a breath as she ran her hand through her thick hair, deep in thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm not ready?‚Äù she turned her head back to meet Alice‚Äôs eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat is different than saying it‚Äôs too soon or denying it. Everyone around you two sees it. Not being ready to go there is one thing, but at least let yourself feel and accept it. Let her in. Let Agatha Fucking Harkness love you and help heal you. YOU‚ÄôRE not broken, Rio. You never have been. People chose to do terrible things to you, ripped your heart out, and left you to pick up the pieces. You have someone who will gladly help put it back together and make you realize how worthy and deserving of love you are,‚Äù Alice put her hand on Rio‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúLet her. She would do anything for you. Let her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs eyes were glassy when Alice finished. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still not ready to admit anything, but I‚Äôm ready to be more forthcoming and stop keeping secrets. I can start there, at least.‚Äù She covered Alice‚Äôs hand with hers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad our preteen angst matched each other.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice let out a small laugh. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be lost without me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWorse.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio lay in bed, Alice‚Äôs words looped in her head. She would not admit any feelings to Agatha, but she would be more honest. That was a good first step. She petted the cat that slept and purred on her chest, speaking out loud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRaven, you know I love you, but there‚Äôs a woman I‚Äôd like in my bed, and it‚Äôs not you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The immortal cat opened her eyes and emitted a low growl before returning to sleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio picked up her phone, careful not to disturb the queen.

      Rio had sent the text and didn‚Äôt even catch what she had called Nicky before it was too late. She could edit it, but it was already marked as read. It was too late, and sending an ‚ÄúI mean your‚Äù text wouldn‚Äôt change it. She didn‚Äôt realize she was holding her breath as the three dots popped up and disappeared repeatedly until her lungs started to burn from the lack of oxygen, and Raven‚Äôs head popped up with alarm. Rio returned to breathing as Agatha finally landed on a reply.

      Good night, Ri.

      Rio looked at Raven and smirked. She knew she would fit the crazy cat lady stereotype if anyone ever overheard exactly how much she spoke to Raven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt understand how much these parents listen to me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She leaned forward and kissed Raven on the head before rolling onto her side, holding the cat in place so she shifted instead of falling.

<p>
<span>
      Seeing Rio call Nicky ‚Äòour son‚Äô had made Agatha‚Äôs heart leap. Yes, it had happened before, and yes, it was scary, but it also made her feel like maybe she could do this again. She sighed, putting her phone on the nightstand and looking to her left, where Rio had been the previous night. Agatha never imagined she would ever want to consistently share a bed or night with someone again, let alone monogamously. She lay there, staring at the shadows on the ceiling as she was flooded with memories of her ex, her hand unconsciously touching the tattoo of Swords on her hip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúStay the night? Please?‚Äù Agatha had asked. She was twenty-three, and after years of Agatha chasing her, Swords had finally given Agatha a chance.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Swords looked her up and down. She was so much older than Agatha and made Agatha painfully aware of it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt stay the night, kid. I also don‚Äôt do monogamous. So don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to start now.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha was crushed, but she wasn‚Äôt going to cry. Not in front of Swords. She couldn‚Äôt look like a baby in front of her. She just nodded.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúRight. Don‚Äôt stay the night. Don‚Äôt give the paparazzi anything to see.‚Äù Swords was a mentor, after all.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúPrecisely, good job.‚Äù Swords kissed her in a way that left Agatha feeling more owned than loved.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Another memory, 10 years later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúAgatha, I‚Äôm too old to have or raise a child, and with your schedule? I would be a primary parent. People would absolutely know we were together then.‚Äù Swords scoffed after Agatha brought it up yet again.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right about me. I can‚Äôt be a good parent with this life.‚Äù Agatha conceded.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt risk being your mother.‚Äù Swords reminded her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha winced at the blow. Another point Swords had used to talk Agatha out of having kids.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn‚Äôt cry at these memories anymore. The ache remained, but the sting was gone. She had turned them off to keep going on with her life. Instead, she thought about how exactly Rio would pull off getting Tony to agree to Nicky taking Morgan to the dance. Rio. This woman had come into Agatha‚Äôs life and turned it upside down in the best of ways. Yes, she had unknowingly brought a stalker with her, but that they could handle. Agatha‚Äôs heart was healing after eighteen years. She was learning to care deeply about someone who wasn‚Äôt her family again. If she could just share the trauma of her past, she would be ready to admit her actual feelings. First, she needed Rio to stay over more. She pulled out her phone again and ordered what she needed to make her home Raven-friendly.

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio met Tony Stark Wednesday afternoon when he picked Morgan up from basketball practice. He was standing in front of the gym a few minutes before practice was scheduled to let out, and she walked up to him wearing a bright smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey, Tony! Morgan did great on her semester final today. I just finished grading it.‚Äù Rio said, stopping in front of him. It was true Morgan had crushed the paper portion, and Rio expected she would do just as well on the lab portion the following day.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony flashed a smile at Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey Rio, She‚Äôs actually been studying with Nicky,‚Äù he sounded surprised, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs Agatha‚Äôs kid, so of course he‚Äôs smart. I just thought I‚Äôd have to separate them more.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBecause he‚Äôs Agatha‚Äôs son?‚Äù Rio raised an eyebrow questioningly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony suddenly remembered that Rio was dating Agatha but didn‚Äôt let his demeanor change.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs your girlfriend. Tell me I‚Äôm wrong to think that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had hoped he would reply that way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDid Pepper worry that Morgan would run through teenage boys like you ran through women?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Shock crossed Tony‚Äôs face before he was able to control it. He had not been expecting that from her. ‚ÄúOkay, maybe I deserved that‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNicky is a great kid, Tony. I‚Äôm sorry for whatever past transpired with you and Agatha but, it‚Äôs been years. More importantly, it has nothing to do with Nicky. Leave the kid out of it, please..‚Äù She was still smiling, and her tone was still very friendly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony felt zero animosity towards Rio, even though he knew he should.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still teenagers. What about him wanting to drive?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you at that age? Or did you want your dad‚Äôs drivers watching your every move? He just got his license, Tony. It‚Äôs one of the few times he can drive other minors without an adult. Yes, they‚Äôre teenagers. Smart ones that were raised well. Pepper did a good job with Morgan, and Wanda had a fabulous influence on Nicky.‚Äù Rio knew that while Tony found Agatha difficult to work with, he adored Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony nodded as Morgan burst out of the gym doors, waving to the other girls on the team and walking to where her father and teacher stood, eyeing them both. ‚ÄúDoes this mean I failed?‚Äù Her eyes darted between both of them nervously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, you‚Äôre grounded.‚Äù Tony said, and Rio answered, ‚ÄúYou crushed it, Morgan!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Tony and rolled her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, you did a great job, Maguna. I‚Äôm proud of you.‚Äù Tony smiled at his daughter. Tony, an arrogant Hollywood heir and proud dad. He turned to Rio and let out a defeated sigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only doing this because you made a compelling argument.‚Äù he turned back to the sixteen-year-old, who looked at him questioningly. ‚ÄúCall your boyfriend and tell him to look decent for the dance on Saturday.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan‚Äôs face lit up as she hugged her dad and then Rio before leading her dad away, telling him about the dance‚Äôs theme before calling Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled as she walked back to her classroom before meeting up with Alice. They both were staying late. She entered her classroom as she received a text and grinned.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised. Teenagers were fast, and of course, he had already messaged Agatha about it.

      Agatha sent the text and had been so close to typing something else but didn‚Äôt. Not before she told Rio everything, especially not in a text, that was immature and stupid. No, she pushed that feeling down and back into its box where it needed to stay. Instead, she typed something much safer.

     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was still smiling as she put her phone in her pocket. She gathered her backpack and lunchbox when she heard footsteps.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAlmost ready, Alice,‚Äù She said, turning as her eyes landed on Lilia. ‚ÄúOh, Ms. Calderu! I thought you‚Äôd have left by now.‚Äù It was five, and while it was finals week, Rio expected teachers and coaches to be at school, not her boss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia gave her a polite smile that didn‚Äôt quite reach her eyes as she took her usual spot on top of a desk and gestured for Rio to sit. Rio was automatically filled with panic as Lilia never stayed for very long as she perched on a stool.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI saw you speaking with Tony Stark.‚Äù It was a statement, not a question.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam, Nicky wanted to take‚Ä¶‚Äù Rio was interrupted by Lilia before she could explain.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know the situation.‚Äù Lilia crossed her legs at the knee, clasping her hands over where they connected. This woman had to be psychic, how could she know already too?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, I‚Äôm happy for you both and the way you handled Tony. Only a few can do so, myself included. Just remember that you have to put your own oxygen mask on first. Has Agatha put hers on?‚Äù She stood up and glided towards the open door before turning back to Rio, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I worried you, but you already had that heavy backpack on, and I didn‚Äôt want you to hurt your back. You‚Äôre rubbing the left side of your chest. It‚Äôs your tell when you're nervous.‚Äù She turned back to the door, ‚ÄúSee you at the dance on Saturday. Tell Agatha to wear a shirt under her suit. Four school days to go!‚Äù She called as she left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat on the stool for a few minutes. Oxygen masks? Has Agatha put hers on? The fuck? She blew a breath out between her lips as Alice came in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat was that about? I saw Calderu come out of here.‚Äù She gestured with her head for them both to leave.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rose from the stool and followed Alice out of the building. She recapped what Lilia had said, even about her nervous stim.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, you always do that as a self-soothing technique. Since we were kids.‚Äù Alice noted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat do you think she means?‚Äù Rio asked as she put her seatbelt on and started the car.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice just shrugged. ‚ÄúWho knows? She‚Äôs known Agatha forever and knows everything in general anyway. The vague comments don‚Äôt help.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thought as she drove. Lilia‚Äôs sporadic appearances and cryptic ‚Äòadvice‚Äô were slightly unnerving to her. She shrugged it off. The next Tuesday would be the last day of school for the semester, and they would have a break. She could work through whatever this was then. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, Nicky‚Äôs gone to SHIELD since Pre-K.‚Äù She acknowledged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, Lilia and Agatha were friends before then.‚Äù Alice supplied as she texted Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow. She vaguely remembered Alice mentioning that once but had forgotten the context.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBefore SHIELD was as big as it is, not that it‚Äôs huge, some teachers would privately tutor child stars. Lilia was one of Agatha‚Äôs teachers. That‚Äôs how Lilia hooked Agatha up with the right lawyers during the trial when Agatha was sixteen.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice reminded Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had forgotten that Lilia had been the one to help Agatha out all those lifetimes ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, right. She does know a lot about Agatha then. No wonder she‚Äôs been dropping random things this semester and winning so many of the dating pool bets.‚Äù Rio laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBitch won the whole damn thing because she knows your story too!‚Äù Alice groaned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSorry, there, sister-friend. No one beats Lilia Calderu, apparently.‚Äù

      Finals week had ended and things had gone well. Rio and Agatha hadn‚Äôt seen each other since Tuesday and Rio felt very teenage girl about it. She had just gotten home and set her school bag down when she heard the text alert.
     </span>

      Rio looked around at her home, she didn‚Äôt have any chores to do, and laundry was caught up. Taking Raven was such a hassle though, it was like packing for an infant. She also needed to start keeping clothes at Agatha‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha then sent pictures of a litterbox, and the pet cameras that were already set up in various rooms so Rio could still check on the cat, auto feeder, and Raven‚Äôs food. Rio was impressed as she felt her heart melt. This woman knew exactly how to get to her.

</p>

<span>
      Hadn‚Äôt Agatha figured out by now that she had won Rio over? She was right about Raven, though. Even if Rio checked in on the ancient cat while she was at Agatha‚Äôs. She smiled as she went to pack her bag.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Raven wasn‚Äôt happy about the car ride, but when she found Nicky‚Äôs room, she forgave Rio. Rio dropped her bag and dress off in Agatha‚Äôs room and returned to the kitchen, where Agatha had dinner ready.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIs Nicky at the clubhouse?‚Äù Rio gave Agatha a chaste kiss as she took their plates to the table.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grabbed their drinks and followed, ‚ÄúNo, he took Morgan out on a date.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had a look of shock on her face as she placed their plates on the table and lowered herself to her seat. ‚ÄúA date tonight AND a dance tomorrow? I AM good!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let out a breathy laugh, ‚ÄúAccording to Pepper, Morgan told Tony she REALLY likes Nicky, so they are going on a double date. Chaperoned by Tony and Pepper.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio placed her hand over her mouth as she tried to suppress her laughter, and failed. ‚ÄúOh no, poor Nicky.‚Äù Rio let out in between breaths.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs laughter was contagious, and Agatha began to laugh as well. ‚ÄúHe made Nicky drive so he could judge his skills,‚Äù Agatha added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs laughter died down, ‚ÄúThe poor boy. That will cause anxiety.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had taken a bite of the steak taco she had made and was still chewing as she nodded and swallowed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHe was still muttering ‚Äòhands at ten and two‚Äô when he left.‚Äù She looked at Rio‚Äôs plate, ‚ÄúHow are you finished? You were talking and laughing!‚Äù She exclaimed, laughing herself. She was adjusting to Rio‚Äôs quirks and found them adorable.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged, ‚ÄúIt just happens! Raven helped, too.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked down to see the cat gazing up at her, licking her lips. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worse than a dog.‚Äù She remarked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThose are fighting words,‚Äù Rio retorted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha found that being with Rio was easy. Their conversations, banter, choosing movies, and even just how they fit together when they sat and cuddled. It had been this way since they met, and Agatha knew how rare that was. Even when they made‚Ä¶uh had sex, everything came easily. It was like they already knew each other‚Äôs bodies and preferences. Agatha had never truly believed in the concept of soulmates. That theory had been shot down when she was young.

       They had been lying in bed at Sword‚Äôs ‚Äòsecret‚Äô apartment where they would meet. Agatha was 25 and traced the older woman‚Äôs collarbone with her fingers as their eyes met. Swords was actually looking at her lovingly, and Agatha blushed.

       Agatha looked away. She had sat up as well, pulling her knees close to her chest. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say that we were.

</p>
<p>
<em>

       ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in soulmates, Agatha.‚Äù Swords said as if she were slamming a door closed on a conversation. Her face softened a bit.

      Rio shifted in Agatha‚Äôs arms as she slept, bringing Agatha out of her memories. The slants of moonlight highlighted the scars on Rio‚Äôs side. Agatha lightly ran her fingers along Rio‚Äôs ribcage, causing her to nuzzle further into Agatha. Agatha was having a difficult time finding sleep as she was plagued with guilt. She pulled Rio closer and whispered.

      The coven had arrived to chaperone the winter formal before the boys did and had taken the opportunity to speak with other parents. When the boys and their dates arrived, the coven had taken pictures, much to the teens‚Äô dismay. Morgan‚Äôs dark brown hair was down in tight curls, and she wore a strapless floor-length red dress with black heels. Tommy‚Äôs date, Cassie Lang, had her light brown hair pulled up, her green halter dress stopped just below the knee, and with black ballet flats. The boys wore black suits and bowties that matched their date‚Äôs dresses. Billy and Eddie complemented each other in shades of blue.

      The dance went well. Rio did her best to sing loudly and embarrass her students. For a few minutes, no one could find four of the six teens, but they returned, saying they had gone to the restroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched as the students got too close to each other or tried to sneak off to dark corners, and she went to haul them back to a more populated area.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed. ‚ÄúIs this what teaching is like?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs not much different. With this age group, it really is 65% keeping them from touching each other.‚Äù Rio laughed as she shot a look at a few students lingering by the refreshments.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThankfully, these guys aren‚Äôt huge into fighting,‚Äù Alice added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI fought a lot,‚Äù Nat remembered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShocker,‚Äù Wanda smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all standing too close. Leave room for Jesus.‚Äù Jen barked, causing Wanda and Nat to step apart, Alice to roll her eyes, and Agatha to pull Rio into her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The last song, a slow song popular with the kids, played when Agatha noticed that Nicky had pulled something out of his pocket. He saw that his mom was watching him, so he grinned and rolled his eyes toward the ceiling, clicking the button. Pounds of white glitter, confetti, streamers, and feathers shot out of cannons above them. While the sounds were startling, once it was discovered what was happening, people laughed, throwing handfuls of confetti and glitter at each other. It was a harmless prank, though a few people slipped, but nothing too bad, Agatha thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned toward Wanda, ‚ÄúThese are the pranks I can handle.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda sighed, ‚ÄúI was worried about them stealing chemicals from Rio‚Äôs lab.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky and Tommy had overheard them as they walked up, both looking hurt at the admission.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe would never do that Mom! Well, not to Rio, specifically.‚Äù Nicky said as Tommy nodded. Agatha hugged them all as everything ended, and the gym lights came back on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre decent kids,‚Äù Agatha told them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúJust decent?‚Äù Nicky grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt push it,‚Äù She said sarcastically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúCan I drive everyone home, Mom? I promise to drive the girls and Eddie straight home and then the three of us, please? I have Mr. Stark‚Äôs permission. If it‚Äôs okay with the other parents?‚Äù Nicky asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked over at Wanda. She knew that Nicky was a rather safe driver and had become pretty responsible, minor pranks aside. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay with it, Wanda?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI trust him with the twins. Just make sure the other adults agree.‚Äù Wanda nodded, her voice slightly nervous as she looked at Nat, who squeezed her hand and nodded in agreement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha inhaled deeply before turning to Rio. She knew this was an important step, and she could easily twist it to be less than what it actually was. ‚ÄúThoughts? These are your kids, after all, and I know you care about them. You also know Nicky‚Äôs reaction times.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was slightly shocked, this wasn‚Äôt her decision to make, and she saw through Agatha‚Äôs facade. Agatha was sharing a parenting decision with Rio and testing the waters.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNicky can handle five other people in the car and tune out distractions if you ask my professional opinion. As your girlfriend, I say let him have this.‚Äù She smiled and kissed Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Eddie and Cassie‚Äôs parents had agreed, and the six teens left. They were in a rather large, safe SUV, and no one was too worried as the roads were dry, and even though it was dark, the sky was clear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The women had stayed to help clean up as Lilia pulled Agatha aside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been hurt, and if you‚Äôre not completely honest with her, it will only cause more damage.‚Äù The older woman mused as she swept up glitter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha scoffed. ‚ÄúWhat would you know about honesty?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve grown a lot as I‚Äôve aged. Now, if you‚Äôll excuse me, your son‚Äôs prank caused a few slight injuries. Glitter and eyeballs don‚Äôt mix, and I need to find Jen and do damage control.‚Äù Lilia handed the broom and dustpan to Agatha and hurried away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked after her and shook her head as Wanda drew up beside her. ‚ÄúWhat was that about?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOur sons‚Äô prank caused minor eye damage. A few kids got glitter in their eyes.‚Äù Agatha said flatly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shrugged, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had glitter in our eyes plenty of times. I‚Äôm more worried about the kids that slipped on feathers.‚Äù Wanda looked around. Everyone was fine and had a good time, and no one was seriously injured. ‚ÄúLilia‚Äôs just bent out of shape because she didn‚Äôt catch them first.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha half-smirked. ‚ÄúShe does hate it when they get one over on her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were back at Agatha‚Äôs, comfortable clothes on, as Jen ranted about having to talk a few parents down from their precious babies having glitter in their eyes or slipping on something.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs glitter! They‚Äôre always around glitter! These kids are idiots! They‚Äôre more likely to do something a hundred times dumber at school. Most of them were laughing about it!‚Äù Her hands were flying through the air as Alice sat next to her, drinking some fancy craft beer, trying not to laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBabe, she‚Äôs just trying to make sure there are no slip-ups or cracks. She‚Äôs been pretty tightly wound since Agatha filled her in on everything.‚Äù Alice put a comforting hand on her girlfriend's thigh as Jen relaxed slightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat‚Äôs phone rang, and she left the room, speaking quietly in Russian. Wanda and Agatha were straining to hear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI think it was cute, and the pictures came out great. Agatha, Rogers sent me this one of us,‚Äù Rio leaned over to show Agatha a picture of glitter swirling around them as they looked at each other, laughing. ‚ÄúPeggy took it, obviously.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat came rushing back in. Agatha and Wanda hadn‚Äôt been able to hear her side of the conversation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSF was released this morning. No one knows where she went. She‚Äôs not in San Francisco.‚Äù She was trying to keep a calm face, but her eyes were full of panic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at her phone to check the time and went back to the others.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt the boys back? It‚Äôs not like them to not check-in.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt dread seep into her bones as her phone rang at the same time Wanda‚Äôs did. They locked eyes as they both answered them with shaky hands. They had read the names on their caller IDs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha answered as a nurse explained that Nicky had been in an accident with three other people, two boys and a girl, Morgan.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       She would be the last one to take home
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , Agatha thought. They would get more details at the hospital, but they needed to get there as soon as possible.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had already been on the move once their phones had rung. Nat called Vision to meet them at the hospital as he was out with friends. Jen and Alice were getting keys to the Tahoe so they could all go in one vehicle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat drove, and no one commented on their speed or the fact that zero traffic laws were being obeyed. Wanda sat in front, white-knuckling Nat‚Äôs thigh, face pale. Agatha looked like a ghost, and Rio wrapped her arms around her, trying to provide some sort of comfort. Jen and Alice had remained quiet, Jen looking for news stories and searching police scanners.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They ran into the emergency room, where a nurse opened a door and pointed down a hallway to a set of chairs where Pepper sat with Morgan and Tommy. Morgan was wearing a pair of sweats that her parents had most likely brought her and had a small bandage on her forehead. Tommy had taken his suit jacket off, and his shirt had some dried blood on it. He had a few cuts on his face, and his wrist was in an ace bandage. Tony leaned against a wall.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about fucking time!‚Äù Tony Spat. ‚ÄúNone of your phones were working!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan nodded. ‚ÄúThe boys' phones auto-dialed when we were in the crash, and nothing happened.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tommy jumped from his seat to run to his mom when he heard Tony speak.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMom! It happened so fast, Billy.‚Äù He started sobbing into his Mom‚Äôs hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked around for the other two boys, grabbing Rio‚Äôs hand and clearing the lump in her throat before asking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Nicky and Billy?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDad!‚Äù Tommy shouted as Vision joined them and hugged his father, still crying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda held on to Nat, not giving a single fuck what anyone saw or thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pepper had started to speak when a doctor came through the double doors and looked at the large group that had gathered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMs. Harkness, Mr. and Mrs. Maximoff, may I speak to the three of you?‚Äù The surgeon asked asked them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kept hold of Rio‚Äôs hand as she walked a few steps off with him. He introduced himself as Dr. Walker, and Wanda held on to Nat, though Vision told Tommy to remain with the others. Walker lifted an eyebrow at the addition of the other two women but said nothing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMs. Harkness, Nicky received the most impact. When he swerved to miss the other car and was essentially run off the road, the front of the vehicle hit a tree, causing the airbags to inflate. He crossed his arms in front of his face, which, upon impact with the airbags, broke his left arm. He also has scratches from the glass, which were treated. We‚Äôre watching his head for any brain bleeding, and he‚Äôs in surgery. His appendix ruptured, and he has three broken ribs and a punctured lung. But everything is going well.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wasn‚Äôt sure how she was still breathing or standing. Tears were running down her cheeks as she sobbed and turned into Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio held her tightly, tears running down her face as well, but trying to hold it together for Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Dr. Walker looked at the Maximoffs. Wanda was crying for Nicky, her hand on Agatha‚Äôs back. ‚ÄúTommy has a wrist sprain, and he protected the girl, Morgan.‚Äù He turned back toward Agatha, ‚ÄúMorgan has a cut above her eye, but that‚Äôs it. Make sure to ask her why. You‚Äôll be proud of your son, Ms. Harkness.‚Äù He turned back to the three adults before him. ‚ÄúBilly hit his head hard against the glass. He has a pretty serious head injury and is unconscious right now, but he‚Äôll be okay. He‚Äôs had stitches, and we‚Äôre watching for brain swelling. He‚Äôll need to be here for a day or so.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He nodded to both families and went back to the operating room. Wanda was relieved and felt terrible for feeling that way. They rejoined the others, and Nat relayed the information to everyone. Rio looked at Morgan, her face a giant question mark.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNicky wouldn‚Äôt let me sit in the front seat. We dropped Cassie and Eddie off, and then he made me get in the back. He said the drive to my place had a potential for deer, and the roads were darker, so no one was allowed to sit up front. Then, when the car came into our lane, and Nicky veered off the road so we wouldn‚Äôt hit it, he yelled, ‚ÄòTommy, get Morgan,‚Äô and Tommy grabbed me, which is why his head didn‚Äôt go into the glass like Billy‚Äôs did. However, I did take some glass to the forehead.‚Äù Morgan touched the bandage on her head gingerly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs hand was over her mouth as Pepper stood and hugged her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good kid, Agatha. He‚Äôs going to be okay.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was upset. She was also livid. This wasn‚Äôt an accident. It had Lou written all over it. How far gone was she to go after CHILDREN?! Rio looked over at Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you going to have to issue a statement?‚Äù Rio‚Äôs voice barely over a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen shrugged as she glanced at the multiple parents.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt was a weekend accident with major injuries, so it was on the news. It will depend on what those six want.‚Äù Jen always included Nat when she mentioned the parents.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat walked over to Rio and put an arm around her shoulders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI need you for a minute,‚Äù she said as she led her off to the side. ‚ÄúI need to go check out the scene, look at all of our phones, but you know‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio interrupted her. ‚ÄúIt had to be...‚Äù Rio‚Äôs phone went off, and she looked at Nat. They both knew who it was.
     </span>

<span>
      Oh, my beautiful Rio. Not their kids.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They‚Äôd be safer without you around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      My children, our children, were always
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      safe with you around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A picture of the kids with Rio was attached. Rio knew that the oldest had known, but the other two didn‚Äôt. Rio was just a good friend of their mom‚Äôs. They had been watching a movie and were all four in a pool, smiling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs eyes filled with tears as she looked at Nat. ‚ÄúI have to tell Agatha myself.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to track this. I had a feeling.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Much to Morgan‚Äôs repeated protests, the Starks departed, though Rio promised to update them. As they left, Tony put his hand on Agatha‚Äôs shoulder and leaned close to her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for all the hell I‚Äôve given you, Harkness. He‚Äôs a good kid. His decision probably saved my daughter. Keep me updated.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice and Jen had returned to the compound and Nat‚Äôs house, conveniently very close to the compound, to get clothes for those staying at the hospital, which would be Wanda, Nat, Agatha, and Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Agatha sat in the cushioned chairs of the waiting room in the early hours of Sunday morning, waiting for Dr. Walker to give them an update. The Maximoffs had been able to see Billy, and while he was groggy, he was okay. He had a few bruises and a head injury, but he would make a full recovery. Once he had seen that his brother was okay, Vision was able to talk Tommy into going home and resting. Vision assured him that the best he could do for everyone was to go to Agatha‚Äôs and take care of Raven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky had taken the majority of the damage.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was nervous but knew she had to tell Agatha that this was essentially her fault. She sighed as she squeezed Agatha‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúAggie?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault,‚Äù Agatha said automatically, voice full of care as she turned to look at Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was taken aback, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even know what I was going to say.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNat told us Satan was released this morning, and then we got a call. It wasn‚Äôt that hard to do the math, babe. Then you and Nat went off to talk, and you‚Äôve been nervous since. What did the text say?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio showed her the text, and Agatha rolled her lips, keeping them in a thin line.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault,‚Äù Agatha repeated as she squeezed Rio‚Äôs hand. At that time, Dr. Walker came out, and Agatha stood and met him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMs. Harkness, Nicky is going to be fine and make a full recovery.‚Äù

      Rio had called Lilia early Sunday morning and taken the two days of that week off, starting her winter break early. Lilia had understood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúEven the strongest of towers need support, especially during storms,‚Äù Lilia had said. That message, Rio had understood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was in a private ICU room, though considering who his mom was, the limited number of guests had been wavered. He was being kept in a medically induced coma for a day while his lung was being monitored, and Agatha sat at his side. Nat walked in and flopped on the couch next to Wanda with a defeated sigh. It was just the four women and Nicky in the room, and they could speak freely.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs bouncing her signal all over the place, so I can‚Äôt locate her. A cell tower was mysteriously down which caused our phones not to take calls for a bit last night. All I know is she‚Äôs not in the country.‚Äù Nat explained angrily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      All eyes turned to Rio, who shook her head, ‚ÄúShe has multiple places to hide. She was always good with investments. Shane too. So even with the divorce, that‚Äôs not an issue.‚Äù She explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd she get released?‚Äù Wanda asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGood lawyers and technicalities,‚Äù Nat answered. ‚ÄúNo evidence of child endangerment apparent. She signed all of her rights over to Shane. There‚Äôs no hard evidence that it was her last night. It‚Äôs all circumstantial. I‚Äôve reached out to some former contacts that are more global. They all have very specific orders.‚Äù She finished, looking at Agatha seriously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded. ‚ÄúGood. Right now, I‚Äôll make it through the winter if it kills me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was starting to worry that it might, if Nat didn‚Äôt find Lou soon.

      Billy was released on Monday, and Nicky was released the day after. The news had leaked, and Jen had released a statement on behalf of the family. An unknown driver had run Nicky off the road, and Nicky used his best judgment. All passengers were safe, and all parents were very grateful that it wasn‚Äôt worse. The families asked that everyone respect their privacy at the time. The Starks made a similar statement adding that Nicky had made sure Morgan was sitting in the back to begin with and had made sure everyone was as safe as possible.

<span>
      It was too much for Rio. Comments were all over the place, and she needed to stop reading them. Her own socials were flooded, asking if everyone was okay. Why were people so parasocial all of a sudden? She shook her head and looked over at Agatha, who was asleep and curled in a ball on the couch. It was Tuesday afternoon, and they had just gotten Nicky settled in a guest room on the first floor. He wasn‚Äôt thrilled, but he needed to wait until his ribs weren‚Äôt as tender before climbing the stairs several times a day. Raven had been annoyed that they had left her in a house she wasn‚Äôt used to, but upon realizing Nicky was hurt, she curled up next to him and stayed there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew Agatha needed a shower and actual sleep in her bed. They had eaten a late lunch, so that was one need out of the way. Rio stood and placed a hand on Agatha‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúAggie, honey.‚Äù She said as she shook her slightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Agatha grumbled, eyes still closed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNicky‚Äôs going to sleep for a while. Let‚Äôs get you cleaned up and in an actual bed, up you go.‚Äù Rio helped her up as Agatha stretched and lazily draped an arm over Rio‚Äôs shoulders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio guided them up the stairs, through Agatha‚Äôs bedroom, and into the bathroom. They had taken quick showers at some point at the hospital, but Rio didn‚Äôt think that counted as really getting clean. That was removing a basic layer of germs. She opened the door to the large walk-in shower and turned the water on to get the temperature just the right side of molten lava they both liked while they both undressed. When the water began to steam, Rio took Agatha's hand and led her into the shower, turning Agatha to face her. Agatha groaned as the hot water hit the muscles in her neck and shoulders, where she had built up tension from the past few days.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize how tight everything was,‚Äù Agatha said softly as Rio ran her hands through Agatha‚Äôs hair to make sure it was wet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou've been holding a lot in. Keeping a mask on for everyone else.‚Äù Rio said honestly as she turned Agatha around and began to wash her hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was taken aback. No one was ever this candid with her. Here Rio was, caring for her in such an intimate way, calling her out in a way no one else would dare to do.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPardon?‚Äù Agatha said with a French accent as Rio massaged her scalp, and Agatha let a moan slip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou heard me. I watch you, Agatha. As much as you watch everybody else. You were terrified, and rightfully so.‚Äù She rinsed the shampoo from Agatha‚Äôs hair and began to repeat the cycle with conditioner. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your son, baby. You had every right to scream, cry, yell, throw things. You remained calm and strong for everyone around you.‚Äù Rio let the conditioner sit as she put body wash on a loofah and began to clean Agatha‚Äôs body thoroughly. ‚ÄúWe are here for you, baby.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      am here for you. Let me be the one to comfort you. Let me be the one you cry on.‚Äù Rio rinsed the conditioner from Agatha‚Äôs hair before moving to rinse the soap from Agatha‚Äôs body. ‚ÄúLet me take care of you in the good times and the bad.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt like a dam within her would burst, and every feeling, guarded thought, and memory would come flooding out toward Rio. She couldn‚Äôt let that happen. Instead, she turned around and brought Rio in for a searing kiss underneath the still-hot water of the shower. She needed Rio at that moment, and she showed it with her lips and her tongue while her hands ran over Rio‚Äôs slickened body. She was not expecting Rio to pull back and drive the tip of a finger into her chest. Agatha looked at Rio, shocked, lips parted, water still streaming down both of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, you do not get to run and hide from your feelings with sex.‚Äù Rio was staring into Agatha as if reading her mind. ‚ÄúWe will finish this shower, dry off, get dressed, and then I will hold you while you talk about your feelings and process like a healthy adult,‚Äù Rio spoke sternly, and it both annoyed Agatha and turned her on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Agatha said curtly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAnd you call me a brat?‚Äù Rio teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were sitting in the bed in lounge clothes. Nicky had been checked on and was still asleep with his feline protector. Rio was sitting with her back against the headboard, Agatha‚Äôs head on her shoulder as Rio stroked her hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, talk.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a lot. I don‚Äôt blame you at all. You cannot control what that psycho does.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha really did not blame Rio. Would this have happened if she and Rio weren‚Äôt dating? No. Did she want a life where she wasn‚Äôt dating Rio? No. What she wanted was a world where Lou Falco wasn‚Äôt a problem, and she had people working on that. She had learned a long time ago that she couldn‚Äôt control everything or what other people did. She could, however, arrange for those people to be taken care of.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe important part is that I raised my son to be mindful of his surroundings and to think. It could have been so much worse. Vision taught him well, too. I‚Äôm not discounting that man's driving lessons. I sent him out in a tank of a vehicle, and that was absolutely the correct choice. He didn‚Äôt want to take any other car.‚Äù She chuckled, ‚ÄúHe said Tony would want her in the safest vehicle we own, Mom.‚Äù She mimicked her son.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good that you can acknowledge all of that, babe. Thank you for not blaming me. I blame myself. I know I brought this all down on everyone.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo. She made that decision. You did nothing.‚Äù Agatha yawned. ‚ÄúMy biggest fear is losing Nicky and then the people I love and care for. This is the closest I‚Äôve ever gotten to that, and it was terrifying.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wasn‚Äôt sure when she started to cry, but she knew there were tears on Rio‚Äôs shirt now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was afraid. Afraid for everyone else, but also because I love those kids, especially Nicky. He truly means a lot to me, Agatha.‚Äù Rio finished with a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The gravity of the admittance hit Agatha right in the heart. Agatha knew how she felt for Rio, but she had to tell her everything, and this just wasn‚Äôt quite the right time for that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThank you for being there with me and not leaving my side. Only Wanda and Nat have done that for me. Thank you, that means so much.‚Äù Agatha sat up and looked at Rio. ‚ÄúI can do anything with YOU by MY side, Rio.‚Äù Agatha kissed her softly before settling into the bed and pulling Rio down with her, laying back on Rio‚Äôs shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNow, what do you want for Christmas?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The following week leading up to Christmas was full of adjustments and healing. Until Nicky‚Äôs ribs felt better, he had to stay downstairs, and the twins spent more time at Agatha‚Äôs instead of everyone being at the Clubhouse. Tommy‚Äôs wrist had healed quickly and Billy‚Äôs injury was starting to fade. Morgan hung out too, not because she felt obligated, but because she genuinely wanted to. Throw in Eddie and Cassie, and Agatha felt like her home was turning into a teenage hangout.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis is literally why we have a separate house for them,‚Äù Agatha bemoaned while sitting in Wanda‚Äôs living room two days before Christmas. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it here as much.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda rolled her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just mad because you and Rio haven‚Äôt had much alone time.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve spent most of our time at Rio‚Äôs but come back at night. Still, I‚Äôd like for there not to be six children eating me out of house and home.‚Äù Agatha said as she wrapped a present for Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey! I foot half that bill, thank you!‚Äù Wanda laughed as she threw a gift bow at her sister.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat walked into the room at the separate piles of gifts and the mounds of gift-wrapping paraphernalia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt see why you two don‚Äôt just wrap a few things yourselves and hire someone else to do the rest. You know, like all your other famous friends do?‚Äù Nat mused before sitting down and grabbing a present to help. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs everyone else?‚Äù She asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúJen and Alice are packing and showing Jen‚Äôs house, I think is what they said?‚Äù Wanda answered as she finished another gift and placed it in the Billy stack.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio said she had things to do at her place.‚Äù Agatha shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúVision is playing racquetball with Herb but should be home soon,‚Äù Wanda added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNever beating the dating allegations,‚Äù Nat smirked as she wrote on a gift tag.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI wonder what Rio got you for Christmas, Aggie?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda grinned and looked at Agatha. She was looking forward to seeing someone who was actually dating Agatha give her a gift. Wanda had never witnessed it before. From what she could remember, Agatha‚Äôs secret girlfriend never gave her anything, and if she had, Agatha had never talked about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt have to give me a present.‚Äù Agatha kept wrapping gifts, partially ignoring the looks of the other two.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so hard getting gifts for women that have or can buy anything they want or need,‚Äù Nat spoke from experience.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou are not to get me anything for Christmas. We file the divorce papers, and then it‚Äôs our personal Christmas.‚Äù Wanda said, looking at Nat as if she were prey.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am well aware.‚Äù Nat returned the same look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am literally right here. Not waiting until it‚Äôs finalized there, kids?‚Äù Agatha raised an eyebrow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll wait for it to be finalized before we get engaged. However, it‚Äôs been 20 years, so, no.‚Äù Wanda said, voice serious.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôll make sure to be nowhere near here.‚Äù Agatha grinned. ‚ÄúYou better still get this one an actual present though. You know she‚Äôll pout if you don‚Äôt,‚Äù Agatha added, looking at Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat just looked at the task at hand and smiled as Wanda shot Agatha a look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stood at her kitchen table with her project spread in front of her. All of her presents were wrapped, and this was the last thing she had left to complete. Agatha‚Äôs present was ninety-nine percent completed, and she was putting the final touches on it. She wrote one final word on the last page before putting it together and wrapping it. She was nervous but couldn‚Äôt wait to give it to Agatha. It would either go incredibly well or burst into flames. She cleaned up the table, threw trash away, and put the scissors, glue, tape, and other supplies back where they belonged. They would be spending the next few days at Agatha‚Äôs and she had replenished the clothes in her duffel and gathered all the gifts in a bag. Raven was still at Agatha‚Äôs as the feline refused to move from Nicky‚Äôs side unless necessary. She was often curled up next to his ribs as if she were trying to heal them faster. Nicky told Raven she was helping.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio loaded everything in the wagon she used to take things to the car so she didn‚Äôt have to make more than one trip. She was getting ready to leave when someone knocked. She froze as she wasn‚Äôt expecting anyone. She really needed to get a video doorbell or start tracking everyone. ‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù Rio called as she walked cautiously toward the door, picking up a potted plant in case she needed to smash it over someone‚Äôs head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Jen, and I‚Äôll use my key if I have to,‚Äù Jen called back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio released a breath she didn‚Äôt realize she was holding as she unlocked and opened the door. Jen‚Äôs eyes immediately went down to the plant.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWere you going to fend someone off with a love fern?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a love fern, and if needed, yes.‚Äù Rio sat the plant back down as she let Jen in, closing and locking the door behind her. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you text or call?‚Äù Rio asked as Jen stood in front of the couch. She looked nervous, and Jennifer Kale was never nervous. ‚ÄúJen? Sit.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen sat, her leg bouncing. This was not the calm, cool, and collected Jen that Rio was used to. ‚ÄúIs it Alice? Is she okay?‚Äù Rio sat down next to Jen, turning to look at her, concern etched on her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes. Yes, it‚Äôs Alice, and yes, she‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù Jen‚Äôs voice shook, and she looked like she was going to cry. Rio put a hand on Jen‚Äôs for comfort.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBreathe, Jen. Do you need water? A beer? Anything.‚Äù Rio offered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen took three deep breaths, regaining her composure. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm okay. I brought Alice back to her apartment, and I was going to leave but I made a last-minute decision. You‚Äôre the closest thing Alice has to family, and it‚Äôs old-fashioned and stupid, but I do love her, and I have for years.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen‚Äôs face was soft and tears were forming. Rio realized that she had tears of her own forming. She knew what was coming, and at the same time, she was shocked that Jen was in front of her, giving her this speech.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen locked eyes with Rio and continued.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI promise that I‚Äôll take care of her, and if I don‚Äôt, you may send Nat after me. Can I have your blessing to marry Alice?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While it was a serious moment, Rio couldn‚Äôt help but burst into laughter. ‚ÄúI am so sorry, Jen, it‚Äôs just, you are the last person I imagined would ask for someone‚Äôs hand in marriage, just because it‚Äôs such a patriarchal thing and you are so, not that,‚Äù Rio said, hand clasped over her mouth, trying to reign it in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen scoffed, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wrong. If it weren‚Äôt you, I wouldn‚Äôt. However, given your relationship and that you‚Äôre all the family she has, it felt right.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt does feel right. Yes, you have my blessing and/or curse to marry my sister. However, you have to do it with the right ring.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stood up and turned toward her room, motioning for Jen to follow her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was going to ask you to look at what I had narrowed it down to.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo. I have the rings. Gran left us her wedding set. Her husband died when Alice was young. I never met him. When Gran got sick, we had strict instructions to keep the rings; whoever married first was to get them, and the other was supposed to give them to whoever proposed. So,‚Äù Rio had entered her closet, found where the safe was hidden, entered the code, grabbed the ring boxes, closed, locked, and concealed the safe and reappeared. She handed Grandpa Wu‚Äôs ring to Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe wants to be proposed to with this one.‚Äù Rio handed Jen a white gold band that was inlaid with fire opal. The inside of the band was engraved with ‚Äòfull of fire‚Äô.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen turned the ring over in her hand before looking back at Rio suspiciously, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Gramps had fingers this small.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled slyly, ‚ÄúI had a feeling this was coming and already had it sized.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen gently shoved Rio‚Äôs shoulder, ‚ÄúLook at you, you big softy.‚Äù Her eyes fell on Gran‚Äôs set of rings. ‚ÄúWhat about those?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThese, I will be keeping in case Alice wants to use them,‚Äù Rio said as she went to put them back in the hidden safe. When she returned, she let Jen know that Alice did not want a proposal made in front of the family or on a holiday. ‚ÄúShe thinks it‚Äôs cliche,‚Äù Rio explained. ‚ÄúShe wants private. Intimate.‚Äù She offered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen took the advice before hugging Rio. Jen wasn‚Äôt much of a hugger, but this deserved a hug. ‚ÄúThanks, Rio. I‚Äôm not sure when it will happen, but I know it will be soon.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen departed as Rio pulled the wagon full of presents and clothes down to the car and drove back to Agatha‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Christmas morning had been a fun kind of chaotic. Everyone would gather at Agatha‚Äôs that afternoon to eat and exchange gifts, though the two families currently living at the compound did their Christmas mornings separately. Nicky had gotten everything he wanted, including a car, as long as he kept his grades up and the troublemaking to a harmless minimum. Nicky had gotten Rio a coffee cup as a gag gift that said ‚Äú#1 Stepdad‚Äù. His serious gift to her was a signed Phoenix Mercury jersey and a framed picture of all of them from the concert, and he had gotten Raven, a pillow for his bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky left the room to attempt to play video games with one arm, so Agatha and Rio could exchange presents alone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They looked at each other, cheeks turning red. Rio had always been embarrassed when she bought or created things for SF.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOpen yours first.‚Äù The women said at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They both smiled, blushing slightly. Agatha had given Swords things over the years but had never received them with genuine gratitude. Agatha always felt like she was being humored, and her gifts were not those of a lover.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù Agatha said, practically shoving two boxes into Rio‚Äôs hands.‚ÄùYou first,‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were sitting on the floor next to the tree, and Rio turned so she was sitting cross-legged, facing Agatha. Agatha mirrored her. Rio peeled back a layer of gift wrap and revealed a black jewelry box. Opening the box, Rio pulled out a silver chain with a shooting star charm on it. ‚ÄúFor our first date,‚Äù Rio smiled, looking up at Agatha as Rio turned it over in her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, but also, it‚Äôs part of my promise to keep you safe. You can click it like a button, and no matter where you are, Nat can track you, just in case,‚Äù Agatha added solemnly. They had been on edge, and this provided them a sense of security.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI love it, and thank you for the added features. That means a lot.‚Äù Rio tilted her chin up as she leaned forward and gave Agatha a chaste kiss on the lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio opened the other box and pulled out two framed charts. One was a star map that had November 28, 2024, written across the top, and at the bottom, it read ‚ÄòThe Night A Wish Came True‚Äô. Rio looked up at Agatha, ‚ÄúThanksgiving? That was a terrible day.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave her an emotional smile. ‚ÄúYes. However, my wish for you to be mine came true that day. It‚Äôs when you said you wanted actually to do this with me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A tear rolled down Rio‚Äôs cheek, ‚ÄúOnly you could take a bad memory and make it happy, Agatha.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>

      Rio looked at the other frame. It was another star map with a specific star labeled. At the top, it read ‚ÄòThe Vidal Star‚Äô and gave the coordinates of a star near the Cancer constellation. Rio began to laugh, a genuine one that turned into a giggle. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the anti-death star!‚Äù She finally said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked, ‚ÄúI knew you‚Äôd like it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs giggles faded as she cupped Agatha‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúBaby, I love it all,‚Äù and kissed her. Agatha pulled away before Rio could go further.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, I have to tell you one more thing, and then I will open the present from you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, motioning for Agatha to continue.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI cleaned out some space in my dresser and closet. Will you keep some of your clothes here? Please? For impromptu sleepovers?‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs eyes were questioning, searching Rio‚Äôs glassy ones. Rio nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWho knew playboy Agatha Harkness was a romantic?‚Äù Rio joked, wiping another tear away as her heart expanded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI sure as hell didn‚Äôt,‚Äù Agatha responded in a whisper, pressing their foreheads together. They stayed like that for a moment before Rio broke the silence.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have nothing as amazing as any of that but here.‚Äù Rio handed Agatha a large box.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha unwrapped it carefully and opened the box, taking out a scrapbook. On the front was a picture of Agatha and Rio from the premiere, and letters spelled out ‚ÄòThe Story of Us‚Äô. Agatha looked up, ‚ÄúThis all about us?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave a slightly embarrassed smile. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what to get the woman who has everything or can buy anything she needs or wants. So, I made this. Open it.‚Äù Rio gestured towards it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could already feel the tears forming as she opened the front cover with a picture of Agatha cheering at a football game. Rio had written various lyrics, what she loved about Agatha, and different things that had been said or that happened around the picture. There were several solo pictures, pictures of both of them that had things she loved about them, pictures with Nicky, and pictures of them with their friends. Each page had lyrics, quotes, and things that she loved about Agatha or them that pertained to the picture.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI love the way you make me giggle.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI love how protective you are of those you care about.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI love the way we always wake up holding each other.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI love how you look like a chipmunk when you chew.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI love how you kiss me.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI love how your eyes sparkle when you look at me.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI love how down-to-earth you are.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI love how involved you are with Nicky.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI love the way you and Jen bicker and how it‚Äôs never really mean.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The song lyrics were a mix of everything, and Agatha enjoyed them, too. The last page was a picture of just Agatha, one that she hadn‚Äôt even been aware Rio had taken. It was at the Halloween party. Agatha was dressed as Moiraine, and she looked over at Rio standing next to her. Agatha‚Äôs face and eyes lit up. The emotion was plain as day, though they wouldn‚Äôt call it what it was. This page held promises from Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI will always stand beside you.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI will always care about you.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI will never become a stranger whose laugh you recognize anywhere.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI will never leave the toilet seat up.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI will always walk the red carpet with you.‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There were a few blank spaces. Agatha wondered why but didn‚Äôt ask. She closed the book and realized she was crying as she looked at Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio reached out and wiped the tears away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio,‚Äù Agatha whispered, ‚ÄúNo one has ever done anything like that for me. It‚Äôs beautiful.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you like it,‚Äù Rio whispered back. ‚ÄúMerry Christmas, Aggie.‚Äù Rio cupped Agatha‚Äôs jaw and pressed her lips to Agatha‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMerry Christmas!‚Äù Billy said as he walked into the house carrying presents.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned. ‚ÄúWhy? Why do we do everything at my house?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Presents had been exchanged, dinner had been eaten and cleaned up, and everything was going well. Vision, Tommy, Nicky, Alice, and Nat were deep into a football game in the living room, Billy and Jen were discussing awards season on the end of one couch, and Agatha, Rio, and Wanda were sitting at the kitchen table talking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúJen is going to propose to Alice,‚Äù Rio said conspiratorily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about damn time,‚Äù Wanda replied, sipping wine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not surprised it‚Äôs Kale doing it first. Control freak.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The other two women chuckled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio noticed Wanda was wearing a new necklace and gestured towards it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYour gift from Nat?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded, ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs also a tracker if I push it.‚Äù Wanda turned to Agatha. ‚ÄúLike Rio‚Äôs, I assume?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shrugged. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre protective of our women around here.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled. She liked being Agatha‚Äôs and being protected by her. She thought it was sweet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stiffened when she received a text.

<span>
      A shiver went down Rio‚Äôs spine as if she had been drenched with ice water. She looked around her as Nat walked in, and Agatha took Rio‚Äôs hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tracking, but the signal is bouncing everywhere. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs in the country.‚Äù

      Rio looked at Agatha with wide eyes. ‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù She wondered out loud. The other adults had come into the kitchen as the boys had been instructed to stay in the other room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTell her it is better,‚Äù Alice scoffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>

      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wrong,‚Äù Rio confirmed.

</p>
<p>

      Nat looked around and put her finger to her lips, and found a notepad and pen. She wrote down, ‚Äòshe can hear us somehow, no one say anything‚Äô. Everyone nodded.

<span>
      The texts stopped and Nat looked around the house for a potential bug. Wanda wrote out on the notepad. ‚ÄòFUCKING HOLIDAY CRASHER‚Äô.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Thirty minutes later, everyone had moved to the living room when every phone went off with notifications, texts, and phone calls. News articles, requests for interviews, requests for statements from Jen texts from friends.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pictures from the past twenty-five years were everywhere: Wanda and Natasha holding hands, kissing, looking at each other. If it was slightly compromising, it was there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was scrolling furiously through article after article, ‚ÄúHow did she get these pictures?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt they only on our phones and computers?‚Äù Agatha asked brows furrowed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSomething is not right,‚Äù Nat muttered as she swore in several different languages.

      Wanda was shocked and looked at the notifications in horror. She silenced call after call and ignored the texts and messages. Vision‚Äôs lips were a thin line, and his face was paler than normal. Nat was speaking fluent Russian, and it was more threatening than it normally sounded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was suffocating. She knew this was her fault. It was Christmas. CHRISTMAS. They had been CELEBRATING.

</p>
<p>
<span>
      suffering you‚Äôre causing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked up from where the message had been mirrored on her phone as she crossed over to Rio and kneeled in front of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNyet. It is not your fault. We knew we had flown too close to the sun with this, and there was a giant possibility it would come out before it was announced. Does this suck? Yes. Do NOT let this psychopath get in your head, okay? These were her decisions, not yours.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat spoke with conviction, and Rio didn‚Äôt dare go against her or doubt a single thing she said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha loved how her friends had embraced Rio and didn‚Äôt blame her for anything. Agatha pulled Rio against her side. ‚ÄúI promise to always be beside you.‚Äù Agatha whispered in Rio‚Äôs hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat had gone back to Wanda‚Äôs side. Wanda looked up and at every single face, one by one.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat do we do now?‚Äù Wanda asked, her green eyes questioning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at the redhead, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to you, superstar.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was afraid you were going to say that,‚Äù Wanda grumbled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just so much easier when you take charge.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know angel, but you all have to decide this. Do you want to post a statement right now? Do you want Jen to reply to something? File divorce papers first thing in the morning? Go on a talk show after the first of the year? There are a lot of options.‚Äù Agatha was formulating a plan as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda thought as she looked over at Nat, Vision, and the boys, and then at the women who hadn‚Äôt been in hiding.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hide anymore. I‚Äôm done hiding. Vision, are you okay if Jen makes a statement to People? I‚Äôll post to my socials tonight, and we‚Äôll file in the morning?‚Äù It was a lot all at once, but she was ready to get the ball rolling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision grinned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve learned quite a bit from your sister. Yes, darling, that all sounds great. Boys, we‚Äôre going to the cabin in Lake Tahoe tomorrow. Don‚Äôt ask questions. Nicky, you‚Äôre coming with us. No, you can‚Äôt do any winter sports.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys took that as a cue to leave, mumbling about adults being gross and the twins stopping to say they agreed with the plan and they were proud of everyone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked at Wanda, ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not waiting any longer. We‚Äôre posting, we‚Äôll handle the world, we‚Äôll file the papers that have been ready for over a month, and we‚Äôll kick Agatha and Rio to Rio‚Äôs apartment so no one interrupts us. Entire compound to ourselves.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDo you need the whole‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFuck off, Harkness,‚Äù Wanda replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen cleared her throat. ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to say?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked at her, contemplating, ‚ÄúWanda and Vision have always done what was in the best interest of the boys. However, the time has come for her to finally live her truth, and they have decided to divorce amicably. Please respect their privacy at this time. Or something like that. I‚Äôm going to call Drew. I‚Äôll do an exclusive interview with her. She‚Äôs the only one I trust. So, I‚Äôll call Drew, I‚Äôll post, and then you return the call or e-mail from People?‚Äù Wanda looked at Jen, hopefully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smiled and nodded. ‚ÄúYou have learned from Agatha. Good job.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda blushed. When it came to dealing with the major issues, Agatha always handled them. She turned to Agatha, ‚ÄúSo?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her proudly, ‚ÄúThat was good, kid. Now get on it. I‚Äôm proud of you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While phone calls, texts, and posts were being made, Nat sat next to Rio and took her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault. I think Wanda is relieved it happened this way.‚Äù Nat glanced over at Wanda as she updated her socials, having already set a date with Drew, who had been ecstatic for them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAs for Looney Toons herself, I called in the big guns, and they were able to narrow a small radius in Morocco and have an‚Ä¶acquaintance in the area. I‚Äôll keep you updated.‚Äù She looked at Rio and saw the worry and fear in her eyes. ‚ÄúRio, if I have to neutralize the threat myself, I will. That‚Äôs a promise.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPosts are made!‚Äù Wanda said triumphantly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat walked back over to Wanda and read one of the posts over her shoulder. Agatha sat back next to Rio so they could read together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDear World,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It seems that I was outed today, on Christmas of all days. People come out every day, and so many famous people belong to the LGBTQIA+ community these days that it shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal. However, because it‚Äôs me, and because my public life was as the girl next door with the cute boyfriend, it‚Äôs shocking. I would even venture to guess, some of you feel betrayed or lied to. I also have a husband and two amazing boys, which adds to it. All of that was true, and my love for Vision and my family was genuine. While there have always been rumors that I was queer, even some of me with Agatha, you were only partially right. Those of you who started WandaNat, you guessed it. You have to understand that while America embraced Agatha for being a lesbian, my then-agent and PR team did not, and it was too late. I fell in love with Natasha twenty-five years ago and have been madly in love with her ever since.¬† Still, with Nat‚Äôs support, I chose my career. Vision and Nat have both knowingly been integral parts of my life. I love my husband, but we‚Äôre not in love. He‚Äôs my best friend and an amazing co-parent. There are no hard feelings there, and he‚Äôs encouraged me to do this. There was no infidelity, no going behind backs, none of the things I‚Äôve seen insinuated since everything leaked. If I lose roles or fans because of this, that‚Äôs fine. I am finally living my truth and being the mother and role model that my sons, and you, deserve. Never sacrifice who you are for your career.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Love,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The Wanda Maximoff.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With it, Wanda had posted various pictures of her and the family, her and Nat, her and the boys, Nat and the boys, and all of them together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI love it, Darling.‚Äù Vision said, kissing Wanda on the top of her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked at Wanda, arms wrapped around her waist. ‚ÄúDoes this mean we‚Äôre officially together again?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda laughed, ‚ÄúI think it does.‚Äù

<span>
      The week between Christmas and New Year‚Äôs was marked by social media posts with WandaNat trending most of the week, more articles, divorce papers being filed, and Agatha and Rio taking Raven and spending time at Rio‚Äôs apartment for a few days so Wanda and Nat had uninterrupted time. On New Year‚Äôs Eve, they were back at Agatha‚Äôs, getting ready for a party hosted by Tony.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHe does throw great parties.‚Äù Agatha was saying as she put her earrings in. ‚ÄúDone, how do I look?‚Äù She turned toward Rio, who had been admiring her from where she sat on the bed for the past fifteen minutes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd look better naked, horizontal, on your back,‚Äù Rio said, tongue running along the inside of her cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave her a wicked smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIf I wasn‚Äôt wearing fresh lipstick, I‚Äôd kiss that smirk off your face.‚Äù She stood and walked toward Rio. She came to a stop and did a full turn, modeling for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was a simple floor-length halter dress cut down to her navel, champagne-colored silk, with a thigh-high slit on the left side and black stilettos accentuating her calf and thigh muscles. Agatha wore her hair down, parted in the middle, in loose waves with diamond drop earrings.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gorgeous, as always, baby.‚Äù Rio kissed Agatha alongside her jaw, her own lipstick having already set. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt leave, though, we won‚Äôt make it to the party.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a bad thing,‚Äù Agatha replied, gripping Rio‚Äôs hips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stepped back, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon Harkness, we have a new year to usher in.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wore a tight, strapless, black, sparkly dress that hit her mid-thigh. She had paired it with black pumps, pulled her hair up, and worn the necklace Agatha gave her. She hadn‚Äôt taken it off since Christmas and, luckily, had earrings that matched it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When they arrived at the party, they met up with the other coven members. Alice excitedly glided towards them in a gold dress.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLOOK!‚Äù She said excitedly as she held up her left hand with the engagement ring firmly planted on her ring finger.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice had called Rio right after, so she and Agatha knew, but she hadn‚Äôt been able to hug her yet. She threw her arms around her and squeezed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am so extremely happy for you. I love you so much.‚Äù Rio said in her ear, trying not to cry. She released her so the other woman could hug her as Jen approached them with Agatha beside her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Jen, ever gorgeous in her black suit trimmed with gold.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy for both of you. Do anything to hurt her, and I will end you.‚Äù She said as she hugged her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at her seriously, ‚ÄúI will never do so intentionally. I promise you that, Rio.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo we have our first engaged couple for the new year,‚Äù Agatha said, holding up a flute of champagne that she had picked up off a nearby table as she handed one to Rio. Everyone else picked up one of their own as they toasted to Jen and Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still‚Ä¶‚Äù Wanda started as Agatha held up her hand to stop her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, it counts. The two of you will be next, I call maid of honor. Vision will probably be Nat‚Äôs best man because of the very special bond you two have.‚ÄùAgatha thought aloud as Wanda blushed slightly. The announcement had been surprisingly well received with little backlash. If SF had been trying to ruin Wanda‚Äôs career, she failed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat raised an eyebrow and looked at Agatha and Rio, ‚ÄúWhat about you two?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not there yet,‚Äù Rio said quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot the marrying type.‚Äù Agatha lied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice saw the hurt in Rio‚Äôs eyes as Wanda saw the lie in Agatha‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI say we all go dance,‚Äù Jen spoke up, shooing everyone towards where the dancing was happening.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys each had their dates, Nicky still with his broken arm, though his ribs were feeling better, which he attributed to a certain magical feline. He and Morgan were dancing to the best of his abilities with his arm in a sling a week and a half after the accident.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you going to be able to play our senior year?‚Äù She asked as they danced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky nodded, ‚ÄúDoc says it‚Äôs looking good, so I should be able to.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She smiled, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care either way, I just want to know if I need to keep my Friday nights open.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky‚Äôs ears turned pink. ‚ÄúSo you plan to keep me around?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAs long as my dad doesn‚Äôt murder you first.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A slow song came on, and he led Morgan outside on the balcony.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey, I know this is kind of soon, but I live with a bunch of women, and I‚Äôm in tune with my emotions. Um, Morgan? I love you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan‚Äôs smile stretched across her face. ‚ÄúWell, my parents are surprisingly hopeless romantics, and I love you too.‚Äù She kissed him before hearing her dad clear his throat behind them, causing Nicky to jump.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSir, I am so sorry.‚Äù He apologized.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDaddy, he loves me, and I love him,‚Äù Morgan said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky looked at Mr. Stark with a look of fear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúUnless you‚Äôd rather me not, sir. Then I will push it back down, sir.‚Äù He swallowed. Even though he was taller than Tony, the man terrified him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony looked him up and down. ‚ÄúDo you love Morgan?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù Nicky replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI believe you think you know what love is having grown up at Compound de Harkimoff. But you‚Äôre still just a kid. If you hurt her, not even Nat can save you, got it?‚Äù Tony said, eyes dark.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù Nicky answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony nodded and turned around, looking for Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked around. It was a few minutes until midnight. Nicky was in love, Alice and Jen were engaged, Wanda was glowing now that she was fully out, Nat finally had her girl, Vision seemed happier, and Agatha was actually getting along with Tony as they both talked to some other actors. Still, Agatha kept glancing over at Rio and smiling, Billy and Eddie were out, and even Tommy had a girlfriend. For all the drama SF was trying to cause, good was coming from it. Rio knew the other shoe would drop, but for right now, things were good. Agatha came over to her and kissed Rio‚Äôs cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost midnight, and I believe I am supposed to kiss my girlfriend.‚Äù Agatha handed Rio a fresh flute of Champagne.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGood thing that‚Äôs me. I would be very upset if it weren‚Äôt.‚Äù Rio took the glass and pulled Agatha close to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The countdown began as she stared into Agatha‚Äôs ocean-blue eyes. This woman Rio cared so deeply for.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The countdown hit midnight, and they kissed before toasting and then kissed again. She tasted the champagne on Agatha‚Äôs mouth and made a silent wish for an amazing year with this woman.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs phone was on a nearby table and went off. Her eyes flew open. That text‚Äôs timing could only be from one person.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned and looked at the phone as if it had started speaking, then looked back at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, baby, it‚Äôs just scare tactics.‚Äù Agatha ran her hand down Rio‚Äôs back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio picked up the phone and almost dropped it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was a picture of LAX.

      Realistically, unless I start writing smaller chapters again, there are probably only a few chapters left. However, I want to make this a series and do a follow-up with one-shots of different moments of life. What would y'all like to see? There are some things I want to go back and do different POV's of, further into the future on some things, etc.

      If that's something anyone would be interested in, of course.

      It was New Year‚Äôs Day, barely after midnight, as Rio clung to Agatha and stared at her phone. ‚ÄúDo you think she‚Äôs actually here? In LA?‚Äù Rio wasn‚Äôt asking anyone specifically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was able to mask the tracking and finally pinpoint her. According to that, she‚Äôs here. As in about to crash the party.‚Äù Nat said, head whipping around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe will not be staying for that,‚Äù Agatha said firmly. ‚ÄúNat, divide up security. Stay with the Maximoffs. Jen and Alice are with them. Ri, carry your shoes and come with me.‚Äù Agatha took Rio‚Äôs hand after they both slipped their shoes off and led her in the opposite direction from the main exit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This was a plan Agatha and Nat had already devised in case SF reared her gorgeous blonde head. Nat would separate the others into two cars and send them home, while Agatha and Rio would slip out the back. While it would look like they got into one of the standard large black SUVs, they would get into an unassuming black Subaru Outback capable of off-roading with Nat as the driver.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, you know I trust you, but where are we going?‚Äù Rio asked as she was led away from the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe planned for her,‚Äù Agatha said over her shoulder as the power went out. They both stopped. ‚ÄúWe did not plan for that.‚Äù Thankfully, backup generators roared to life, and the power flickered back on. Agatha quickened their pace to where they were practically running as they burst through the back door. ‚ÄúOkay, go around the SUV and get in the Subaru,‚Äù Agatha instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio flung open the passenger door to see Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShotgun.‚Äù Wanda waved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNat, Wanda is supposed to be at the compound with everyone else!‚Äù Agatha admonished as she and Rio climbed in the back, buckling their seatbelts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou try telling her no.‚Äù Nat shot back as she pulled away from the building.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have. Plenty of times.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTo be fair, you‚Äôre not in love or sleeping with me.‚Äù Wanda turned around in her seat, smiling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes.
     </span>
</p>

      Oh Cinderella, we didn‚Äôt
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      even get to dance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a feral scream, causing Nat to run off the road momentarily before correcting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of this! I hate this! Why can‚Äôt she just leave me alone?‚Äù Rio had tears in her eyes as Agatha held her hand. ‚ÄúAgatha, being with you has made me so happy, yet I have cried so much. I have caused you so much pain. We had to leave a party early, in a fucking getaway car, because of my ex. Thanksgiving and Christmas were partly ruined. The boys have been put in danger. Who knows what else she‚Äôll do? I can‚Äôt lose you, Agatha. I can‚Äôt lose any of you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had been looking at Agatha before looking at Wanda, who had turned around in her seat. She inhaled deeply. She had made a decision, and it hurt, as all she wanted to do was go back to Agatha‚Äôs and sleep in her arms. ‚ÄúWhen we return to the compound, I‚Äôm going home.‚Äù She immediately winked at Agatha and Wanda. She didn‚Äôt know if SF could hear them, but she wasn‚Äôt taking any chances.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Darcy had upgraded the networks at the compound and all houses, as they hadn‚Äôt found a single bug anywhere. Lou was dangerously intelligent for a supermodel, although that had been more of a cover for her cat burglary gig. Modeling was also how she caught Shane's eye all those years ago. She hadn‚Äôt necessarily confessed to Rio as much as Rio had found out about it accidentally.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned to Agatha. ‚ÄúWhen we get to the house, I‚Äôll explain everything.‚Äù She whispered in Agatha‚Äôs ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, Cinderella, looks like your Princess Charming from Hell is trying to collect on that dance,‚Äù Nat said as she looked in the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúEveryone, hold on. This is our exit.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt an‚Ä¶‚Äù Wanda started as Nat made a hard left onto a hidden dirt path, thankful there was no oncoming traffic on this particular backroad.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat didn‚Äôt slow the vehicle down as they bounced over the uneven terrain and careened around trees, following what seemed like an invisible path. Rio kept her eyes trained on the headlights behind them before they finally fell out of view. She turned around, slumping in her seat, ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned close as a precaution before whispering, ‚ÄúSecret back entrance.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They went through a gated entrance at the back of the compound, passing by the foundation of Alice and Jen‚Äôs house, the skeleton of the guest house, and around to the front of Agatha‚Äôs. As they exited the vehicle, Rio motioned for them to leave their phones in the car and stay outside for the moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if she can hear us through the phones, but I‚Äôm now highly paranoid, pumped full of adrenaline, and running on champagne fumes at one forty-five in the morning on New Year's Day. Here‚Äôs the plan, in case she can still hear us in the house. We‚Äôre going to go in there, and you two,‚Äù Rio looked at Wanda and Agatha. ‚ÄúAre going to use those Oscar-winning skills of yours. I will go off about how I need to go home and think about things, and we‚Äôll improvise from there. I will go to my apartment, and she‚Äôll most likely meet me there. Hopefully, I can convince her to leave me alone, or Nat, you do you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a fan, what if‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha started before Rio put her fingers to Agatha‚Äôs lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPlease. Let me do this. We have to try and end this. If it doesn‚Äôt work, it doesn‚Äôt work. I still believe she won‚Äôt hurt me.‚Äù She removed her hand and kissed Agatha before she could respond.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda and Nat exchanged looks. They weren‚Äôt as certain as Rio seemed to be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha swallowed the tears and confessions in her throat. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù she turned to Wanda, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go superstar.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh! Wait!‚Äù Rio held up a hand before they entered the house. ‚ÄúRaven is staying here. They hate each other, and I do not trust Lou to be nice. Now, everyone, get your phones first.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stormed into the house first, where everyone was gathered. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this to everyone anymore, Aggie! I want this so much, but it‚Äôs just causing pain!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was on her heels, ‚ÄúRio! We can work this out. I‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha realized this suddenly felt very real to her, and she almost let it slip. Again. She had to confess, and soon. ‚ÄúCare about you so much. We‚Äôve met her head-on since this started. We can handle this together. We can end the entire thing.‚Äù Agatha had given an overly theatrical wink to everyone in the room when they had come in, and Wanda had done a double thumbs up. Agatha hoped everyone knew this was fake. Wasn‚Äôt it?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had winced when Agatha had, once again, avoided saying ‚Äòlove‚Äô. ‚ÄúAt least Lou is honest with me about her feelings. Psychotic or not.‚Äù She said in a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was a blow to the chest, and Agatha deserved it. Looking at Rio, hurt in her eyes, she said, ‚ÄúBaby, I‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going home, I need to think some things over,‚Äù Rio stated louder as she turned and stormed out the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha dropped onto a couch, Alice scooting over just in time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWas that acting?‚Äù Agatha asked, looking at Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure,‚Äù Wanda answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat had followed Rio outside. ‚ÄúHey, stop for a second!‚Äù She called out as Rio stopped right in front of her car, not turning. Nat stopped behind her, whispering. ‚ÄúShe does, you know. She just doesn‚Äôt know how to say it. Don‚Äôt give up on her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned around slowly, her face blank. ‚ÄúNat, I just,‚Äù she sighed. ‚ÄúI want to tell her, and there‚Äôs a woman who IS telling me, and I just‚Ä¶‚Äù she trailed off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat put a firm hand on her shoulder. ‚ÄúLook, you have to go in there with a clear head, okay? Also, do you want this?‚Äù She offered a small handgun, not wanting to say the words aloud for fear of Lou‚Äôs eavesdropping.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head. She could shoot, but she didn‚Äôt want to. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm covered.‚Äù She said, brandishing a small knife. A rather creepy smile pulled at her lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúScary bitch. Alright, go. We‚Äôll see you soon.‚Äù Nat let her go and stepped back as Rio left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was numb on the drive to her building, and facts swirled around her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou was insane and dangerous.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou loved Rio but felt like she owned her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou viewed Rio as an object.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was amazing and wanted a life with Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha refused to find and/or admit her feelings.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was not in love with Lou.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had caused her friends a lot of problems.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was madly in love with Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt her stomach churn.
     </span>
</p>

      She was conflicted. Rio knew she had these feelings for Agatha, but she hadn‚Äôt fully admitted them to anyone else. She should be able to share them, shouldn‚Äôt she? She had told Alice she wasn‚Äôt ready, but when would she be? What was holding her back? Was she waiting for Lou to disappear? Was she waiting on Agatha? When would she know?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had to keep her head clear and protect the people she loved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was jolted out of her thoughts when her phone dinged, and her GPS showed a new location. Lou must be controlling her phone. Rio would have to tell Nat but couldn‚Äôt risk using the compromised cellphone.

<span>
      I have a surprise planned for us.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I can‚Äôt wait to see you.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt sick, but she also knew she needed to follow the GPS. She drove as it directed, trusting that Nat would be able to find her, and followed the automated voice to a fancy apartment building in an isolated nice area of town.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat saw the message mirrored on the clone of Rio‚Äôs phone as Rio turned in the opposite direction. She would have to follow discreetly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs she doing?‚Äù Agatha asked from the passenger seat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had been able to convince everyone else to stay at the compound.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSF hacked Rio‚Äôs phone and sent her to a different location,‚Äù Nat responded, careful to follow from a distance. The route started to look familiar. ‚ÄúAgatha, are we headed to‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Agatha interrupted. ‚ÄúMy condo.‚Äù She finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou still own it?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYep,‚Äù Agatha said with a pop.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHave you listed it?‚Äù Nat looked at her briefly before turning back to the road.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said with a sigh. ‚ÄúThis is going to be really bad.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had learned from Swords that it was best to keep a separate place for flings and one-night stands. Her condo was out of the way, discreet, and everything she needed it to be. She had meant to list it and hadn‚Äôt yet, knowing she had to confess to Rio first. Then, she would sell it as a final symbol of shedding her past life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat slammed her fist into the steering wheel, startling Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBlyat, Agatha! I threatened Rio so she would open up to you when YOU‚ÄôRE the idiot here! I have been keeping your extremely dark secrets for decades and making sure none of your poor decisions come back to bite you in the ass. Rio comes into our lives and, in a few months, does things that even you couldn‚Äôt do, Agatha. Yet YOU won‚Äôt tell her everything. I know there are secrets that Lorna took to the grave with her, but it‚Äôs time to confess all of those to Rio and finally tell her that you love her. She‚Äôs not going to wait for you forever, Agatha.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat‚Äôs face matched her hair, and Agatha understood where her anger and frustration were coming from.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù Agatha whispered, staring straight ahead as they reached the building.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know I am. Now, before we bust in there, we‚Äôll listen to the conversation to see when we need to save the day.‚Äù Nat had produced a laptop, and her fingers were flying across the keyboard.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a mic in the necklace that I can tap into,‚Äù Nat said as she brought up the audio. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs ONLY for emergencies,‚Äù Nat added, seeing the look of concern on Agatha‚Äôs face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took a deep breath as she reached the building she had been directed to, trusting that Nat and Agatha weren‚Äôt far behind.
     </span>

      Look at the row of
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      mailboxes. You‚Äôll be
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      able to find it from there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio walked into the building. The doorman looked at her slightly confused before he nodded and greeted her by name. She walked the row of mailboxes and saw A.H. on the last one.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A.H.? Agatha Harkness? Why did Agatha have a condo here?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She took the elevator to the penthouse and stepped out before walking to the unit. 821. The numbers seemed familiar to Rio before it clicked, Lorna‚Äôs birthday, backward. January twenty-eighth. Rio approached the door and looked at the keypad on the door. If this really was Agatha‚Äôs place, then she knew the code would be the day the order to be free of her mother was granted. She prayed it wouldn‚Äôt work as she typed in the numbers. The light flashed green, and the lock clicked as she turned the knob and pushed the door open.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was still wearing the dress from the party, and she suddenly became painfully aware of how revealing it was as the door closed and locked behind her. Lou was standing in front of her, wearing jeans and a black cable knit sweater. Lou looked flawless as her eyes wandered possessively over Rio‚Äôs body.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed you, my pet,‚Äù Lou said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI hate you,‚Äù Rio walked into the room, past Lou, and perched on the arm of a couch. The apartment didn‚Äôt have many personal effects, but it oozed Agatha‚Äôs personality.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat is this place, Lou?‚Äù Rio asked with a sigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A smile crept across Lou‚Äôs face as she stalked towards Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha‚Äôs fuck pad, pet. She didn‚Äôt take women home with her. She brought them here. Funny, she still has it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked away, not wanting to give Lou the satisfaction of seeing the hurt on her face. It felt like someone had stabbed her in the heart and twisted. No wonder Agatha hadn‚Äôt told her she loved her. She couldn‚Äôt let go of the past. ‚ÄúOkay, so it hasn‚Äôt sold yet.‚Äù She said quietly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even on the market.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Another blow. Rio stood, moving further from Lou.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLike you were always truthful, Lou? I almost died because you weren‚Äôt.‚Äù Rio was trying to keep her voice flat and void of all emotion, but the emotions were seeping in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI realize my actions caused you harm, and I would never hurt you, Rio. I am so sorry, and as for all of this,‚Äù She gestured around, ‚ÄúI had to get your attention, baby.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou was right behind Rio as she wrapped her arms around Rio‚Äôs waist.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stiffened. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to touch me like this anymore, Lou.‚Äù She said hotly, flinging Lou‚Äôs arms away, stepping out of the embrace, and turning around. ‚ÄúIs this your master plan, Lou? Come in here, show me Agatha has a secret apartment, and hope I break up with her? This is a conversation, Lou. Not a reason to break up with her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was more annoyed at this point.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHonestly, I thought she‚Äôd be here with you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou had closed in on her again, and Rio felt like she was being chased around the apartment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre stalling until she shows up? God, Lou. You have lost it. We are not getting back together. You hurt our kids, Lou.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio spat, looking right at Lou, who was only inches away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou looked hurt at that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBaby, I would never hurt our kids. They‚Äôre safe with Shane.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was shocked. Did Lou really think she was talking about Lou‚Äôs kids?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, Lou. Nicky. Billy. Tommy. Hell, even Morgan. You‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was cut off as Lou slapped her, open-handed across the face, before shoving her against the wall, hand wrapping around Rio‚Äôs throat with the slightest amount of pressure. Rio brought her hands up and wrapped them around Lou‚Äôs wrist, trying to push it away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou used to love it when I choked you. Begged me to choke you harder.‚Äù She purred.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio scoffed, ‚ÄúThat was before you completely ignored the safe word and blew past all my boundaries. You know who doesn‚Äôt do that? Agatha. You know who takes care of me in bed? Agatha. In bed and everywhere else. It will always be Agatha. Not you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou‚Äôs grip tightened despite Rio‚Äôs best efforts to loosen it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The door flew open as Nat and Agatha ran in. Lou quickly removed her hand and looked at the newly arrived women as Rio fell to her knees, gulping in lungfuls of air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs about fucking time!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou watched as Agatha ran to Rio and knelt beside her. Agatha had tears building from seeing and hearing where Rio had been hurt and from the anger toward Lou rising in her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, are you okay?‚Äù Agatha asked as she lightly touched Rio‚Äôs reddened cheek where Lou had slapped her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Agatha, hurt and pain in her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not. We have to talk.‚Äù Rio‚Äôs voice was raspy as Agatha helped her stand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat hadn‚Äôt drawn her weapon, but she had positioned herself where Lou would have to go through her first to get back to Rio or Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLeave her alone, Lou, she doesn‚Äôt want you,‚Äù Nat said harshly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt your fight, you feisty chihuahua.‚Äù Lou looked back at Agatha. ‚ÄúAh, and the bitch that stole what‚Äôs mine.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       belong
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      to anyone.‚Äù Agatha took a step forward, her arm protectively in front of Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI gave her everything!‚Äù Lou screamed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou‚Äôs face was screwed up in fury as she stepped towards Agatha only stopping when she
     </span>
<span>
      saw Nat take a step forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio lowered Agatha‚Äôs arm aside, moving towards Lou.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou gave me NOTHING. You took and took everything from me. You stripped away my sense of safety, my sense of security, my love, my freedom, my self-respect, my dignity, my sanity, my ability to TRUST.‚Äù Her voice went from acidic to soft as she turned to Agatha. ‚ÄúAgatha gave that BACK to me, Lou.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A sardonic smile cut across Lou‚Äôs face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPlease. She can‚Äôt even tell you she loves you. Do you think THIS was the only secret she was keeping from you? Ha. She‚Äôs the queen of deception, pet.‚Äù Lou looked at Agatha. ‚ÄúAre you going to tell her, or should I?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha narrowed her eyes at her. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know anything.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDo you think Rio‚Äôs phone was the only one I hacked? I heard an interesting conversation between the unholy trinity here, my sweet. Looks like Superstar and Jane Bond only know half-truths about your global sweetheart here, too.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou‚Äôs arms were crossed in front of her chest, and her smile was a Cheshire cat-like grin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNat, end her,‚Äù Agatha instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head, moving forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, Nat, is this true?‚Äù Rio asked, her eyes filled with uncertainty and pain.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha responded, flustered, ‚ÄúThere was never a right time to bring it up.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Rio,‚Äù Nat said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNat, it wasn‚Äôt yours or Wanda‚Äôs place to tell me. Agatha? How many times do we have to go through this? YOU were the one begging me to open up, and you only fed me enough, so I wouldn‚Äôt ask more questions? Is there more to why you don‚Äôt do relationships? Tell me now. No more excuses..‚Äù Rio‚Äôs voice betrayed her hurt, rage, and unfinished ultimatum.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sensing the opening, Lou jumped in. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt love you the way I do, baby. Just look at her phone. Go to November first.‚Äù Lou instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha handed her phone to Rio, scouring her memory of that night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the night I went out to the club, Wanda brought my drunk ass to your house. I have nothing to hide, Rio.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took the phone and tapped in the code.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAt least she has been forthright. I trust the blonde sociopath over there more than you right now.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She pulled up the photo app and went to November 1st. There were pictures from the football game and pictures from the club, and then, Rio‚Äôs hand flew to her mouth as she let out a gasp. Nat rushed to look over Rio‚Äôs shoulder, shock on her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat? What is it?‚Äù Agatha asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh? You don‚Äôt remember?‚Äù Rio spat each word dripping acid. Lou began to laugh maniacally.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was extremely drunk,‚Äù Agatha tried to explain as Rio thrust the phone into Agatha‚Äôs hands. Agatha looked at the picture. There she was, passionately kissing Lou, one hand in the blonde‚Äôs hair, the other gripping her shoulder tightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lou interrupted in the most rational voice she could muster.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt tell you she loves you. She gets drunk and makes out with someone less than twenty-four hours after kissing you, and then a few hours later, what does she tell you? Oh, right, that you‚Äôre the only one she‚Äôs wanted since she first saw you. Now, I admit I‚Äôve fucked up, but baby, not only has therapy helped me. But if I could turn back time to take back all the things that hurt you, I would, baby. I love you so much. I wouldn‚Äôt hide a ten-year-long secret relationship from you. Oh, shit. Guess the cat‚Äôs out of the bag now.‚Äù Lou put her hand over her mouth like she had accidentally let it slip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just flinched, and Nat looked at Agatha with her eyes wide.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWHAT! Is THAT why you don‚Äôt date?! Because of some brutal relationship you had? That‚Äôs an important thing to tell me!‚Äù She exploded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat turned back to Lou. She was going to make this bitch disappear. ‚ÄúWhere did she go?‚Äù She asked out loud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      In all the commotion, Lou had escaped. The door was slightly open, so Nat ran out to see if she could chase her down, closing it behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Agatha, flames in her eyes, ‚ÄúYou begged me to be honest and upfront and tell you everything, and I did. But, you kept lying to me!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt lie. I just didn‚Äôt tell you the complete truth,‚Äù Agatha lied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs even worse!‚Äù Rio yelled. ‚ÄúYou were in a relationship for TEN years, Agatha. TEN YEARS. You didn‚Äôt think that was something I needed to know? You told me you wanted me, that I was IT, and yet you KEPT YOUR SECRET APARTMENT. The place you only used to fuck other women. But, most importantly, you didn‚Äôt tell me about it. You didn‚Äôt think THAT would piss me off?!‚Äù Rio was pacing in front of Agatha, hands flying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou seemed pretty calm about that a moment‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBecause I wasn‚Äôt going to say anything in front of my sociopathic stalker of an ex, dumbass! So¬† for the record, I am NOT CALM ABOUT IT.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stopped and looked straight at Agatha. Rio ran her hands through her hair, she couldn‚Äôt stay here right now, she didn‚Äôt want to hear Agatha‚Äôs excuses or explanations, but she also knew they weren‚Äôt over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGod, Agatha, to think, I was ready to tell you‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt matter. I can‚Äôt look at you right now. I‚Äôm going to my place, I‚Äôll get Raven later. Just know that we are NOT broken up, and¬† this conversation is nowhere near over We have the Globes this weekend, so this is not a pass to go fuck someone or make out with my ex, since I have to be clear about that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio saw Agatha wince as the verbal blow hit, and she didn‚Äôt care how vicious her words were.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have thinking to do, and you have confessions to make. Get your shit together, Harkness.‚Äù With that, Rio stormed out, refusing to look back at Agatha. Rio hadn‚Äôt even let her talk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sank onto a couch, buried her face into her hands, and cried.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had gotten home around five in the morning. She needed Nat to remove the malware on her phone but didn‚Äôt care right now. Let Lou listen in on things, what did it matter now? She had stripped off her dress, sobbed in the shower, put on pajamas, and then sobbed in her bed. She had spent most of the break in Agatha‚Äôs arms every single night. She didn‚Äôt even have her cat. She sighed as she grabbed her phone.

      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to feed her first and put the ice cream in the freezer,‚Äù Alice called out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio didn‚Äôt respond, just lay there, waiting for her found sister, when the bed moved, and Alice curled up behind her. They would cuddle and talk for hours growing up and then during breakups or any disappointment they experienced through the years. They had found comfort in each other for the past twenty-three years of their lives, and Rio was thankful they were in the same city again. Rio rolled over and buried her head in Alice‚Äôs shoulder, sobbing again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know, Ri. I‚Äôm proud of you for telling Agatha you had to talk first and not break up. That‚Äôs great!‚Äù Alice praised her friend. It was a big step. Usually, Rio ran instead of facing things head-on. She wasn‚Äôt proud of everything Rio had said, but she was focusing on the good right now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt she tell me?‚Äù Rio sniffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI think it caused some serious damage and trauma for her, according to Nat and Wanda. And they don‚Äôt even know the whole story or who the woman is. It happened eighteen years ago, and she hasn‚Äôt had a relationship since.‚Äù Alice provided.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe still needs to tell me everything,‚Äù Rio stated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe does. Wanda says there‚Äôs probably a lot more.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled onto her back, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do. Lou apologized, you know?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRight before trying to kill you.‚Äù Alice reminded her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúForeplay?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou cannot go back to her, Rio.‚Äù Alice gripped Rio‚Äôs hand, trying to convey the seriousness of the situation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI wonder if that‚Äôs the only way everyone will be safe,‚Äù Rio responded, sounding hopeless.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNat finally decided to use all means necessary to end it,‚Äù Alice whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs eyes went wide. She knew what that meant and wasn‚Äôt exactly sure how she felt about it. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù was all she could utter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only real way to keep us safe, and you know it,‚Äù Alice assured her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know it is.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      What surprised Rio was how empty she felt on the inside. She had loved that psychotic woman, and now they were talking about her demise, and she felt nothing but relief.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt absolutely awful. She hadn‚Äôt been honest and now everything had blown up in her face. Nat was working on Agatha‚Äôs phone and double-checking that all of Lou‚Äôs malware had been removed while Wanda sat on the opposite end of the couch from Agatha, glaring at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you,‚Äù Wanda said for what had to be the hundredth time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already established that.‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs voice was hoarse from crying since she left the penthouse. Jen was already working on getting it listed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI just, I can‚Äôt believe you hadn‚Äôt listed that place! God, Agatha! What were you thinking? We know that bitch has been listening in to conversations and will do anything to break the two of you up. You‚Äôre going to lose her, Agatha, and it will be your fault.‚Äù Wanda said harshly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew Wanda was serious, and she had started to cry again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the best thing to happen to you since Nicky.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm well aware.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you, Agatha? Or are you taking her for granted? This is your true second chance, and you might not get a third. Not everyone wants to take a chance on your playboy ass, or if they did, they would be after your money or other ulterior motives.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda‚Äôs words were like a punch to the gut. Had she been aware of how lucky she had been? Wanda was right. It was hard dating when you were Agatha Fucking Harkness. That‚Äôs what Swords had taught her, wasn‚Äôt it? Rio never cared about Agatha‚Äôs fame or her money. Half the time, Rio insisted on paying and got annoyed when Agatha beat her to it. The job was just now starting to bother Rio, and only because Agatha was about to be away for longer. Rio wasn‚Äôt interested in fame for herself or getting her foot in the door. Agatha looked at Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI should have listened to you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou fucking think?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat handed Agatha her phone back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fixed and secure. Don‚Äôt text Rio until I tell you it‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm going over there now. Don‚Äôt make me keep secrets from her again.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked at Agatha as if it were more of a threat than a warning before leaving.
     </span>

      Rio was eating her Half Baked ice cream straight from the container at ten on the morning of New Year‚Äôs, and she didn‚Äôt care who judged her for it. Her relationship was rocky, and her ex was still out there somewhere, most likely listening to everything she said. She and Alice sat on Rio‚Äôs bed, Raven trying to steal bites of ice cream from both of them. Alice was the friend she needed to be, but she was tired and had barely slept since she woke up the day before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMaybe I should just make a playlist and send it to her‚Ä¶‚Äù Rio was saying when Alice received a text from Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey, Nat‚Äôs coming over to clear your phone. Then, you need to try to go to sleep.‚Äù She looked at Rio and saw how exhausted she truly was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can.‚Äù Rio sounded two inches tall.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt talk to Agatha like this. I‚Äôll make Gran‚Äôs tea. That always knocked you out.‚Äù Alice said decisively as she stood, ‚ÄúSpeaking of, do you‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIn the safe,‚Äù Rio finished for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice smiled, glad Rio could read her mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThanks, I knew you‚Äôd keep Gran‚Äôs set.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She walked into the closet before looking down to where the safe was hidden, seeing where the clothes had been tossed aside and the door to the safe hanging open.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, the safe‚Ä¶‚Äù Alice‚Äôs voice trailing off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio placed the empty ice cream container on the end table, Raven practically pounced on it.¬† Rio scrambled off the bed to join Alice in the closet. She stood next to Alice, phone in the pocket of her pajama pants.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe usually doesn‚Äôt leave a safe ajar,‚Äù Rio said sarcastically as she knelt to open it and looked inside. She knew all of Lou‚Äôs tricks and knew Lou would never figure out the code. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs here,‚Äù she said, handing Alice the rings and taking out the manilla folder that held Lorna‚Äôs papers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio fished her phone from her pocket and muttered, ‚Äú3, 2, 1‚Ä¶‚Äù and pressed the text as soon as it popped up.

      Rio‚Äôs jaw clenched as she stood back up and looked at Alice. ‚ÄúWhat did your mom know?‚Äù She mouthed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shrugged, looking just as confused as Rio felt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to call her Aggie, and whatever you have, she‚Äôs going to tell me.‚Äù

     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio opened her mouth to reply but couldn‚Äôt find the words. She and Alice turned as they heard Nat come in the front door. They took the contents from the safe and emerged from the closet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in here,‚Äù Alice raised her voice loud enough for the other woman to hear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat entered the room, and her eyes immediately fell on the envelope Rio was clenching. Nat took Rio‚Äôs phone and gestured with her head so they would follow her to the living room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice grabbed the ice cream trash, which was licked clean by a certain tortoiseshell feline and spoons, and they followed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat started to work her magic, and once the diagnostics were working and she was positive Lou could no longer hear them, she began talking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù She gestured towards the envelope.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLou was here,‚Äù Rio said blankly. ‚ÄúShe made copies of whatever is in here, apparently information Lorna had on Agatha.‚Äù She looked up at Nat, eyes questioning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the answers. If Agatha trusted anyone with absolutely everything, it was Lorna,‚Äù Nat answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice‚Äôs eyes were wide. ‚ÄúLorna Wu? My mother? More than Wanda?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWanda was still young, finding her way. She had a lot going on, meaning me. Agatha wasn‚Äôt going to burden her with anything extremely heavy. Lorna had her demons, but she loved and protected fiercely. Just like you do, Alice.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat had a metal water bottle and took a drink from it. ‚ÄúI wish you two had gotten to know her like we did,‚Äù Nat gave them a half smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúJust getting to hear people talk about her the way you guys do is enough,‚Äù Alice said, her eyes glistening.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat handed Rio her phone back once it had finished. ‚ÄúGet some sleep and then text her, please. Wanda‚Äôs trying to get her to sleep as well. Everyone needs some damn sleep.‚Äù Nat yawned. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt help to change the locks, will it?‚Äù Nat asked, knowing the answer as Rio shook her head. Lou would get past whatever they attempted. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôm going bitch hunting,‚Äù Nat added with a dark smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They watched as she left before Alice turned back to Rio. ‚ÄúRight, so, Gran‚Äôs tea.‚Äù Alice looked at the thick envelope. ‚ÄúWhat are we going to do with that?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio held it up and examined it. ‚ÄúNothing yet. I‚Äôll give Agatha a chance, and if I feel like I need to read it, okay. I may just give it to Agatha, honestly.‚Äù After all, it seemed like the information was all Agatha‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Alice still didn‚Äôt know what secrets Lorna would have had about Agatha that Lou would find interesting.

      Agatha had napped on the couch, waiting for Nat to text her, telling her she could text or call Rio. She checked the time on her watch, eight p.m. ‚ÄúUgh,‚Äù she groaned, knowing her sleep schedule would be off. There was also a text from Nat saying she could text Rio now. She felt slightly less tired but still like the terrible girlfriend she had been. All she wanted to do was hold Rio, run her fingers through her hair, apologize, and tell her everything. Well, almost everything. Some things may still be better off unsaid. She rolled onto her back and stared at the high ceiling of the living room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you ever tell the whole truth?‚Äù A 21-year-old Agatha asked Swords with naive curiosity. Swords was still rejecting her, but they had run into each other at the New York club that Agatha secretly owned and were speaking as friends.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you want anyone to know you own this place?‚Äù Swords countered.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want people to try and get in my good graces just for free drinks or to expect me always to be here. Or to think I‚Äôm trying to curate my own pool of women, as it were.‚Äù Agatha explained.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúRight. You want to uphold a certain image, and so do I.‚Äù Answered Swords. ‚Äú There are certain things I want to keep quiet about myself. I don‚Äôt mind that people know I have a life outside of my career or hold secrets by NDA, but being with some of the biggest names in Hollywood? I can‚Äôt have that. I can‚Äôt be accused of the things I would be accused of, kid.‚Äù Swords replied, flipping her hair back.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúDo you ever want kids‚Ä¶?‚Äù The question was out of her mouth before Agatha even thought about it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Swords chuckled. ‚ÄúWith my job? Probably not. I‚Äôm already getting past that age, and you know how hard it is to have a successful career and kids. Look at Lorna.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha nodded and looked down, trying to school her expression. Alice was five, and Lorna barely saw her. She said she was better off with Norma and away from this life where she would spend all of her time with nannies.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to create the image you want people to see, Aggie. Keep a few people close and most distant. The world loves you and accepts your bad girl ways. Play into it. It makes you unique. Keep the new kid, the redhead, close. She‚Äôs interesting and your opposite. You want that balance. Be her Lorna. Keep Lorna close to you, too. Now, we‚Äôve been seen together for far too long, and there is a very cute girl over there with pink hair that has been trying to get your eye.‚Äù Swords said as she left.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Swords had taught Agatha a lot over the years‚Äîthe influence upon her life beyond quantifiable. Even if Swords had destroyed her, she had done some good things. However, the wound she intentionally or unintentionally inflicted left a scar so sensitive, that Agatha was still so hesitant to let herself love again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha was 27, and she and Swords were having a pleasant night in. They had had an actual date. Pizza, movies, and Swords was trying to develop Agatha‚Äôs taste for wine. Agatha preferred harder liquor and fruity things. However, Swords was trying to make her more sophisticated.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on Broadway, kid. You spend time with people like Meryl Streep and Cher. You need to drink more than Malibu, Grey Goose, and‚Ä¶are these Smirnoffs?‚Äù Swords said, looking through Agatha‚Äôs fridge.¬† It was summer, and they were in New York again.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúSo? I‚Äôve been on Broadway before, I won a Tony as a teenager, in case you‚Äôve forgotten and Cher is more your friend. Lorna, Wanda, Drew, Madonna, none of them have problems with what I drink.‚Äù Agatha reached for a green Smirnoff, only for Swords to swat at her hand.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúNone of them have an EGOT with another Broadway show forthcoming.‚Äù Swords was pouring a glass of wine. ‚ÄúA lady knows her wines.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI have never been accused of being a lady,‚Äù Agatha responded wryly.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou certainly don‚Äôt fuck like one,‚Äù Swords laughed.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha leaned against the counter, crossing her legs at the ankles. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to get me drunk for that if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre trying to do.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>

       Swords handed the wine glasses to Agatha as she grabbed the bottle and led Agatha to the living room of Agatha‚Äôs Manhattan apartment.

<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúNo, I mean, are you in love with me?‚Äù Agatha took a deep breath. It‚Äôs just, that I am so deeply in love with you. You won‚Äôt let me tell anyone we‚Äôre seeing each other, while I want to scream it from the rooftops. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and you laugh it off, insisting we see other people.‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs eyes were about to betray her as she tried to hold her tears back.
      </span>

<em>

       ‚ÄúYes, I love you, Agatha, but those things are impossible. I don‚Äôt want any of that, and you know it. I will not explain it to you again. Now, don‚Äôt go ruining a good night before it‚Äôs even begun.‚Äù Swords reached for Agatha‚Äôs cheek as Agatha retreated backward.

       ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Swords was shocked. Agatha had never kicked her out before.

</p>
<p>

<span>
       ‚ÄúYou heard me, leave.‚Äù She said, standing up and walking to her bedroom.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She heard Swords leave and sobbed, calling Lorna, who was so proud of her for standing up for herself.
      </span>

       Agatha begged Swords to forgive her four days later.

<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo wonder I‚Äôm like this,‚Äù Agatha said out loud to no one as she picked up her phone. Swords had told her repeatedly never to grovel or beg, and finally, she had stopped. Stopped going back to her. She raised her phone again and typed out multiple messages before finally landing on one.

      Jen listed the condo.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio, I am so sorry.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Can we please talk?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Okay, so Agatha probably should have told her in person, but she needed to get that off her chest. She stared at her phone, waiting for the response.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio read Agatha‚Äôs text. She knew Jen had listed the condo, and Alice had told her as much. She didn‚Äôt care about that, not really. She was mad that it had been a secret. Of course, she wanted to talk to Agatha, but where? If they talked at Rio‚Äôs, then she could kick Agatha out if she needed to. If they went to Agatha‚Äôs, Rio could very dramatically walk out. Either way, she wanted to see Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a sap, Vidal.‚Äù She said to herself.

<span>
      Yes.

      When?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There, the ball was in Agatha‚Äôs court. She could decide where, when, and everything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was panicking. Did she want Rio to come over? Should they eat? Should she order something? Nicky was up at the clubhouse with the twins. She should order dinner and have Rio over, is what she should do, she finally decided.
     </span>

<span>
      Rio was biting her thumbnail, thinking. She was hungry, but part of her wanted to make Agatha wait. The problem with that was she would have to wait, too. She sighed as she typed back and got out of the bed she had been sleeping in to change into sweats without holes in them.

<span>
      Rio was facing Agatha on their usual ends of the couch, pizza devoured, water cups on the coffee table, and Rio had music playing as she stared at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTime to come clean. I‚Äôm only going to ask you this one more time. Why don‚Äôt you date, Agatha?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took a deep breath in through her nose and let it out through her mouth before beginning. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not pretty,‚Äù She started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be,‚Äù Rio could handle it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúA long time ago, I loved someone, and she destroyed me. I was young, twenty-three, and I had chased her for years. I call her Swords.‚Äù Agatha started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Something clicked in Rio‚Äôs brain, ‚ÄúYour tattoo‚Ä¶it‚Äôs for her. She‚Äôs your heartbreak. You‚Äôve lied to me since the first time we had sex.‚Äù Rio‚Äôs voice was hollow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took Rio‚Äôs hand and tipped her chin to look into Rio‚Äôs big brown eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, look at me. That was not the time to bring that up, okay? Was I supposed to say, ‚Äòyeah, that‚Äôs for the ex I never told you about‚Äô right after the best sex I‚Äôve ever had?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs voice was sincere and Rio could tell that she was, in fact, being truthful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, best? Agatha, that‚Äôs hyperbolic.‚Äù Rio‚Äôs voice was skeptical.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just sex with you, Rio. That‚Äôs why. It‚Äôs more than that, and it is for you, too, so don‚Äôt play it off. Now, may I continue, or are you going to keep giving me that disbelieving look?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. It is more than that.‚Äù Rio pushed her hair behind her ears and tried to put a more neutral expression on her face. ‚ÄúOkay, continue. You were twenty-three and in love with Swords.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes. She was much older, and no, I‚Äôm not telling you who she was.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had raised an eyebrow in question, and Agatha reached over and poked it, eliciting a small smile from the younger woman.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe dated for roughly a decade on and off before I finally decided I had had enough, and I couldn‚Äôt take the pain anymore. I believe she loved the idea of me, but she wasn‚Äôt a marriage and family type of woman. I wanted it all, and she didn‚Äôt want anyone to know we were together. We weren‚Äôt monogamous; she never wanted to be, which was fine at first. She told me to keep up my reputation, and I did. She was the kind of woman that dealt in secrets and information, hidden identities, falsehoods, and half-truths,‚Äù Agatha let out an empty laugh. ‚ÄúShe taught me everything I know. She‚Äôs the one who told me to keep a hidden condo and curate my image and what I let people see. She tried to talk me out of children for the longest time when I finally decided I wanted a child more than I wanted her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs voice was full of sadness, but she didn‚Äôt cry. It felt good to get it off her chest, to confide in Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe worked with a lot of celebrities in different capacities and didn‚Äôt want being associated with me to screw it up. Imagine being associated with me being viewed as a bad thing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWanda and Nat didn‚Äôt even know I was dating at the time. Not until it was over, and they still don‚Äôt know who she is to this day. Lorna was the only one who knew, and only because she knew Swords, too. I told Lorna everything back then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAnyway, I was madly in love with her, but she didn‚Äôt love me the same way, and every single time she broke my heart, I would just crawl back to her, and every single time she would act as if she were teaching me some valuable lesson.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked off to the side as though she saw the memories pass by.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAfter I finally walked away, I told myself I would never let myself experience that heartbreak again. I threw all my love into my family, career, and other projects.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen you came along, and for the first time in eighteen years, I felt something more than mere lust or desire.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha cradled Rio‚Äôs cheek and wiped away a tear that had escaped one of her beautiful brown eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt terrifies me to feel this again, Rio. But, I know you wouldn‚Äôt hurt me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was processing everything Agatha had just told her and felt tears on her cheeks for the young Agatha. Rio‚Äôs story wasn‚Äôt great, but ten years of a dead-end relationship with someone who was never completely yours because they didn‚Äôt want to be? What was it with the women around here having tragic love lives?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, why didn‚Äôt you just tell me all of this in the first place?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio searched Agatha‚Äôs eyes for something that told her she was being dishonest, and all she saw was pain and regret.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOur original conversation had come to a natural end, and I didn‚Äôt know how to restart it. I was scared. I was so afraid it would be too much. I haven‚Äôt allowed myself to have any romantic feelings until you, and look at how much I‚Äôve fucked it up.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let out a sob as she dropped her forehead against Rio‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am so sorry, baby. Then, the apartment, I should have told you. Part of me was waiting to make this big declaration and listing it as this big symbol of shedding the last part of my old life when I should have done it from the start.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wiped Agatha‚Äôs tears as she lightly kissed her cheeks where the tears had been.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh Agatha, I‚Äôm not surprised you had an apartment. It was the fact you hadn‚Äôt listed it yet, or even told me about it. We‚Äôve barely been together for a month. I‚Äôm not stupid. You‚Äôve just sounded so sure of everything, so set on this, on us. Then you throw out things like you‚Äôre not the marrying type.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou refuse to call this what it is. It‚Äôs confusing. I know we‚Äôre still at the beginning of this, though it feels like I‚Äôve known you my whole life, and everything comes so easy with you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat back, immediately missing the contact. Agatha blew out a breath and looked down at her hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgain, this terrifies me. You have seen me in some of my most emotional states, Rio. Yes, I begged you to let me in and bare your soul to me, and you did. This is me laying it all out to you,‚Äù
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       most of it,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha thought, a small pang of guilt slicing through her heart. She still felt like she had to protect Swords. There were even darker secrets to be told, and she was still trying to control the narrative of her image. Some secrets were between her, Swords, and Lorna. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know if I can say those words yet, and I am so furious at myself for that because I want to, and yet, I can‚Äôt.‚Äù Agatha started crying again. Rio put her hands on Agatha‚Äôs knees.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha? Do you believe in soulmates?‚Äù She asked, echoes of young Agatha‚Äôs voice echoing in her ears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI thought I did once,‚Äù Agatha said timidly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm beginning to think I do, and Agatha, with how quickly we‚Äôve come together, how quickly I‚Äôve fallen for you, and how natural everything seems? I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any other explanation, but it shouldn‚Äôt be this hard to admit it.‚Äù Rio was going back and forth. Should she tell Agatha, and just not expect anything back? Should she leave? There was no script for this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou were so worried that you were broken, and you are not, Rio. People did things to you, yes, but that‚Äôs not you. You were not broken. Being with you is as easy as breathing, Rio. I am damaged. I am the one that has to learn how to do all these things normally. You had every right to be afraid, and you went for it. I completely understand if you need to walk away, if you need us to take a break for a while‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs tears flowed freely now, and there was no use trying to get them to stop. She knew her eyes were red and puffy, and she couldn‚Äôt imagine what would happen if the deepest, darkest secrets ever came out. Swords was a completely different person now, and she didn‚Äôt want to cause her pain or potential pain to Alice if she knew that her own mother had known.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had been looking down as she played with the hem of her sweats, and her head snapped up. ‚ÄúA break? Excuse me? You‚Äôre about to go to Canada, and you want to take a break?‚Äù Her voice was bordering on hysterical.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs hands had been in her lap, and she quickly took Rio‚Äôs hands. ‚ÄúBaby, no, I was saying if you wanted a break because I can‚Äôt tell you how much‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice trailed off, not able to say the words. Something deep within her told her she couldn‚Äôt without telling her everything, and how was she supposed to do that?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave her a defeated nod as she stood. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a break, and I‚Äôm not walking away. However, I am exhausted, and we both need sleep.‚Äù She stood there for several minutes, looking between the stairs, in the direction of the front door, and at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha watched as Rio struggled to make her decision before Rio finally sighed and grabbed Agatha‚Äôs hand, hauling her to her feet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve developed a bad habit; we‚Äôre going to bed,‚Äù Rio said, her voice shaking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Minutes later, Rio was drifting off to sleep in Agatha‚Äôs arms. She wasn‚Äôt as peaceful as usual, but she was where she wanted to be. She knew Agatha well enough by now to know that Agatha hadn‚Äôt been completely honest with her and was still holding back. Agatha‚Äôs breathing had evened out, and upon checking, Rio deemed that she was asleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI love you, Agatha,‚Äù she whispered before falling into a fitful sleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hadn‚Äôt been completely asleep when Rio‚Äôs whispered words filled the dark bedroom. Her heart stuttered, and she wished she could return the sentiment and show Rio how much she loved her. Instead, coward that she was, Agatha continued to feign sleep.

      Lou had heard the whole conversation. She couldn‚Äôt listen into their phones anymore, but she was still tapped into the houses through the pet cameras and mic. She looked down at the copies of the documents she had taken pictures of. The marriage certificate that had never been filed or signed, with the other name blacked out. The ultrasound pictures dated 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks, and 11 weeks, with Harkness, Agatha in the top corner. Lou had guessed what had happened after that, seeing as how they were from two years before Nicky was born. She had also taken pictures of pages from Lorna‚Äôs journal, although even she had used the nickname for Agatha‚Äôs ex. It was all spelled out there in print. She just had to convince Rio to look at the envelope of evidence and prove to Rio that Agatha was still refusing to tell her the whole truth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>

</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was still awake with Rio asleep in her arms when Nat‚Äôs text came through around one, letting Agatha know that Lou had whatever secrets Lorna had and may have kept. Agatha turned her head toward Rio with a tortured look. Rio mumbled in her sleep, and Agatha only caught every few words. Lyrics to Taylor Swift songs, something about ‚Äòjust tell me‚Äô and ‚Äòfucking Lou‚Äô. Agatha ran her fingers through Rio‚Äôs hair and thought about the past few months. The day she met Rio, or well, met grown-up adult Rio. She had been stopped in her tracks by Rio‚Äôs warm mahogany eyes while surrounded by the smell of Axe. It would absolutely be a story one day. Rio was right in how easy and natural everything was between them. Agatha would never have crawled into bed with someone just to cuddle. The great Agatha Harkness had been brought to her knees by this woman in less than a month and had tried to ignore it until she couldn‚Äôt any longer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, the scrapbook Rio had made her, the pictures, the things Rio had remembered to write, the lyrics. Rio often spoke in lyrics, movie and TV quotes, and pop culture references. She had put all of that into the scrapbook and enlisted Wanda‚Äôs help with pictures, pulling them from every available source. The woman was as cunning as Agatha was, and Rio had left blank spaces around the picture of Agatha; she assumed she would fill in the future. However, there were blank spaces around a few other pictures.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was then that the light bulb went off. Rio had seen every single one of Agatha‚Äôs movies, including the most recent one. Death‚Äôs Beloved and a few of the mystery and action ones had included black light ink. Agatha carefully removed herself from beneath Rio, kissing her lightly on the forehead as she left the bed, grabbed the scrapbook off her nightstand, and went to Nicky‚Äôs room. She knew he had a blacklight pen left over from a spy-themed birthday party from a few years ago. She found it and took the two items downstairs. She settled on the couch cross-legged, opened the scrapbook in her lap, and turned on the blacklight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The picture Wanda had taken of them at the back-to-school party. They were sitting on the beach, talking animatedly with the sunset in front of them. She scanned the page as hidden lyrics popped out, separated on the page. ‚ÄòMet you at the right time‚Äô; ‚ÄòLivin‚Äô in a movie I‚Äôve watched,‚Äô; ‚ÄòFunny, ‚Äòcause you couldn‚Äôt have called it‚Äô.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She flipped through pages, a movie night where Wanda had taken a picture of them cuddled on the couch, Rio‚Äôs head in Agatha‚Äôs lap, Agatha playing with Rio‚Äôs hair and talking to Jen or Alice off camera. In blacklight ink, lyrics from ‚ÄòEnchanted‚Äô, a recurring song throughout so far, ‚Äòtwo a.m. who do you love?‚Äô, ‚Äòplease don‚Äôt be in love with someone else‚Äô. That picture had been taken in early October, it seemed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pictures from New York, a paparazzi shot of all things, but a damn good one. Above this one, ‚ÄòWe fell in love in October, that‚Äôs why I love fall.‚Äô Agatha waited for her heart to stop, for some wild reaction, raised anxiety, and nothing. She was calm as a warmth washed over her, and she smiled. Agatha had started falling for Rio before October, but that was a definite turning point.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A picture from their first date, ‚ÄòAll my life, I‚Äôve been looking for this‚Äô. Another date, ‚ÄòFor me, it‚Äôs always you‚Äô. Thanksgiving and the social media posts, ‚ÄòIs it alright to feel this way so early?‚Äô, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre the risk I‚Äôm gonna take it‚Äô. A picture from the winter dance, ‚ÄòToo soon to tell you I love you‚Äô. Rio and Agatha on the couch in Nicky‚Äôs hospital room. Wanda had taken it because she thought it was sweet. Agatha had succumbed to emotional exhaustion, and Rio was holding her as if she was trying to protect her from everything going on in the world, ‚ÄúI want you for worse or for better.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The hidden messages combined with what had already been written only amplified the meaning of the gift that Agatha held. She did her best not to get any tears on the scrapbook and was thankful for the page protectors. She knew this had been made with care and love, but it was so much more. It was the words Rio had said to her just a few hours before. Then the picture of Agatha. She took a deep breath as the blacklight landed on the page, and it lit up like Coachella in the middle of the desert.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòI wanna teach you how forever feels,‚Äô; ‚ÄòYou could absolutely break my heart, that‚Äôs how I know we‚Äôre in love,‚Äô; ‚ÄòI‚Äôm gonna give you my heart‚Äô; ‚ÄòI want the secrets your secrets haven‚Äôt found,‚Äô;
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄòWhat if I let it slip? (Tell you that oh, my God, I fucking love you)‚Äô.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      At the bottom, there was an arrow telling her to turn the page, and on the back was a letter from Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha,

<p>
<span>
      As I am writing this, it has been roughly five months since we met at the fieldhouse at SHIELD. We have been through so much in that time. Our friends will say we put them through a slow-burn romance, though compared to those four, we sped through this. I know it‚Äôs a stereotype that sapphics move rather quickly, but I think we just go with what feels right, and this does.

      I grew up watching you and idolizing you. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would ever be friends with you, let alone one of your inner circle. Then, we fell for each other; you kissed me, you took me on dates, Agatha Fucking Harkness swept me off my feet, and fuck it, I fell in love with you and am finally admitting it to myself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I hope when you find this, we‚Äôve either finally admitted it or you‚Äôve at least figured out how you feel. I feel like we‚Äôve lived a movie of our own, full of drama, and we deserve a happy ending.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Please be my happily ever after.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Love, Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs hands were shaking as she closed the scrapbook, turned off the pen, and placed them both on the coffee table before her. She wasn‚Äôt shaking from Rio‚Äôs confession, but because she knew without a shadow of a doubt that she was ready to tell Rio what she hadn‚Äôt told her earlier. Fuck Swords, she could protect herself, and Rio would never find out who she was anyway.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI see you figured out the secret?‚Äù Rio‚Äôs voice came from behind the couch, starting Agatha. She hadn‚Äôt even heard her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hummed as Rio sat next to Agatha, curling her legs underneath her arm on the back of the couch. Agatha turned to face her, mirroring their positions from earlier in the night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI did, and I love everything in it. Everything.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She made sure to hold Rio‚Äôs gaze as she said it. Agatha cupped the back of Rio‚Äôs neck with one hand and her cheek with the other as she pressed her lips to Rio‚Äôs. Agatha‚Äôs thumb caressed gentle circles along Rio‚Äôs jaw as she kissed Rio tenderly. As Rio attempted to deepen the kiss, Agatha reluctantly pulled back. Rio made a whining sound at the sudden loss as she watched Agatha sit back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, there are some things I need to tell you before we go any further,‚Äù Agatha was finally ready to share some of her deepest and darkest secrets that only two other people knew, and one of them was no longer alive.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded and sighed. ‚ÄúI suspected there was more,‚Äù Rio said bitterly, looking away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to explain that too, okay?‚Äù Agatha looked at Rio as if seeking her permission and approval to continue.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked back at Agatha, ‚ÄúOkay, Agatha.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She could see the resignation written on Agatha‚Äôs face and could tell that Agatha truly was ready to get everything out in the open. Agatha took Rio‚Äôs hands in hers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFirst, you need to understand that outside of professionals, the only other people who knew about these events were myself, Lorna, and Swords. The reason I didn‚Äôt tell you earlier was that I wanted to control my own narrative and protect Swords. However, I believe your feelings about me won‚Äôt change, and Swords can protect herself. I‚Äôm still not telling you who she is, just in case your paths ever cross.‚Äù Agatha looked at Rio for confirmation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, ‚ÄúI knew there was still something, which is why I wasn‚Äôt sleeping well and then came down here when you weren‚Äôt in bed.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou were right. However, there‚Äôs something I need to tell you first. I wasn‚Äôt asleep earlier, and then with everything written in there,‚Äù Agatha gestured toward what was now one of her most prized possessions, sitting on the table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been running from my feelings, and I have to stop. Rio Vidal, I am absolutely in love with you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      These were not words Rio was expecting to hear yet, and they were words she was willing to wait for, but hearing them made her heart almost burst with joy. She knew Agatha had things to tell her, but right now, she was just happy that Agatha Fucking Harkness was in love with her and finally admitted it. Rio surged forward, grabbing Agatha by the shoulders to kiss her hard and fast. There would be time for more later, but she had to kiss her right now. As Rio leaned back, she looked at Agatha and grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI love you too, Agatha Harkness. Now, tell me everything.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled at her, feeling at peace even though she was about to share a part of her that she hadn‚Äôt shared with anyone. ‚ÄúI am going to, but I‚Äôm old, and I have spent too much time on this couch and not enough time holding you.‚Äù Agatha stood, holding out her hand for Rio. As they went back upstairs, Agatha began. ‚ÄúRemember how I told you that Swords didn‚Äôt want kids?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded as they walked back into Agatha‚Äôs room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, she continuously talked me out of it, and finally, at 33, I decided I would with or without her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had assumed their normal position, and Agatha sighed contentedly. Something about holding Rio gave her the confidence she needed to get through this. Agatha continued.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe had had a discussion, and I had asked her one last time about kids, and she shut it down and told me I couldn‚Äôt risk becoming like my mother. She didn‚Äôt know that I was already going through fertility treatments and had chosen a donor, the whole nine yards. It was my roundabout way of seeing where she was at for the final time. She shot it down, so I knew what would happen if I succeeded.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was looking down at Rio, who was, in turn, looking up at her. They had perfected this way of lying and talking, Agatha running her hand up and down Rio‚Äôs side, Rio‚Äôs hand in Agatha‚Äôs hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was doing the math. Nicky was born in 2008 when Agatha was 35. It had been a thing, the world‚Äôs favorite lesbian becoming a single mom thanks to science. It put women‚Äôs healthcare and fertility treatments in the spotlight. Yet another trailblazing moment for Agatha Harkness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, please tell me that it was near the end of the year, and it took a bit to get pregnant,‚Äù Rio looked at Agatha, concerned. Nicky‚Äôs birthday was in June, and Agatha‚Äôs was in March. She had been barely 35 when she had Nicky, and the math wasn‚Äôt mathing the way Rio wanted it to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave Rio a sad smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, baby. We‚Äôre getting there. I got pregnant pretty quickly. It was September 2006 when I told her about it. Anyway, Wanda and Nat were out of the country as Wanda was filming. Lorna knew, though. I wasn‚Äôt trying to baby-trap Swords. I made sure she knew that. I gave her the option to break up, and we did. Then, something changed her mind in October, and she decided to marry me and have a family. I had asked her so many times if she was sure, and she said yes.‚Äù Agatha sighed. ‚ÄúI lost the baby a few days before the wedding and told Swords. There I was, in November, on the beach with Lorna, a white dress and all‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs voice trailed off, and Rio desperately tried to fill in the blanks and hurt this obviously caused the woman she loved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDid she use the loss as her way out? To leave you at the altar? I‚Äôll kill the bitch!‚Äù While she was so thankful she had Agatha, her protective side wanted to throw hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot the main reason, no. She initially put her career first, but it was a reason. She said the pregnancy clouded her judgment, and to play devil‚Äôs advocate, she never did want marriage and kids. I was still shattered, though. I was so desperately in love with her, and that‚Äôs the day I decided I was done with her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs heart hurt for Agatha. This woman, who seemingly had everything, hadn‚Äôt been allowed to have the one thing she wanted most: a relationship.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDoes she work in Hollywood?‚Äù Rio asked softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, and before you ask, yes. We still come in contact with each other, and she has changed since then.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She saw the question in Rio‚Äôs eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, I wouldn‚Äôt. She could beg me to come back, and I would tell her no. She missed her chance and absolutely destroyed me. Comparing this to that, well, there‚Äôs no comparison. This? What you and I are building? This is pure. It‚Äôs not built on youthful infatuation and puppy love. We went in with eyes wide open and knew the risks. We have mutual respect, and we have our autonomy. This?‚Äù She gestured between them, ‚Äúis real, Rio.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had bared everything except for Swords‚Äô true identity and how they met. She finally felt free of the secrets she had been holding.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt the intensity of the moment as she stroked along Agatha‚Äôs jaw and down the length of her neck. Her thoughts were overwhelmingly crowded, and she couldn‚Äôt separate them. What she did know was that she loved Agatha more than she had ever loved before and she couldn‚Äôt imagine why someone would throw away the opportunity to spend their life with Agatha and throw it away for some dumb career in Hollywood. She hoped Swords‚Äô money and, Rio assumed, career made Swords happy because Rio was the true winner in this. Rio kissed Agatha before she looked at her again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have questions,‚Äù Rio stated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you do.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat does she say about Nicky?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took a moment to consider her response.
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHonestly, I think she‚Äôs surprised I‚Äôm this involved.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGood. That bitch,‚Äù Rio smirked. If she ever found out who Swords was, she couldn‚Äôt promise niceties.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha huffed a laugh, ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs someone you like? It could be Cher.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked scandalized. ‚ÄúShe is twenty-seven years older than you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe fact that you automatically knew that isn‚Äôt surprising at all. Would you believe that Cher‚Äôs ‚ÄúBelieve‚Äù is about me? But no, it‚Äôs not her.‚Äù Agatha hated that damn song. ‚ÄúI have a question for you, though, about something you mentioned previously.‚Äù Agatha bit the inside of her lip, not sure how she was going to respond to the answer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew that Agatha had picked up on what she had said and knew this was coming as she motioned for Agatha to go on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhen you said that you and the supermodel from hell had been talking about marriage and planning a future‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha trailed off, letting Rio take it from there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Rio answered the unasked question. ‚ÄúWe were talking about kids, even hypothetically planning it, very ‚Äòtalking rings and talking cradles‚Äô, though I know now that she is not the love nor the loss of my life. I told you Labor Day weekend that it was dependent upon who I was with, and you do come with a kid. Three, technically.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This was not a conversation Rio wanted to have right now. They both needed sleep, and she wanted to engage in other activities once she knew what day it was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha picked up on Rio‚Äôs hesitation and left it for now. She knew they needed to sleep, though that was not the activity she wanted to engage in. Being responsible was not for the faint of heart. However, neither of them had slept much in the past forty-eight hours, and that would not do for what she had planned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe can revisit everything later. Our sleep schedules are now nonexistent. It might be Thursday, and we have a big weekend ahead of us,‚Äù Agatha said as she kissed Rio‚Äôs forehead and settled in more. ‚ÄúBesides, I need energy to show you how much I love you. I hope you don‚Äôt have plans later today.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By Sunday morning, sleep schedules had returned to somewhat normal, and award season was kicking off. Agatha‚Äôs house was full of makeup artists, hairstylists, and stylists, and the boys had been sent on yet another caffeine run.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda and Agatha were having their hair done in Agatha‚Äôs bathroom, attempting to talk while having makeup applied at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am so excited for you actually to have Nat with you as your date, Superstar,‚Äù Agatha said, careful not to move her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They would have other security with them. Wanda deserved this. Vision was glad he didn‚Äôt have to do the whole dog and pony show and could just sit in the family sections with the boys and Alice. Jen would be working and checking in with everyone as she could. She had already briefed red-carpet correspondents and was currently texting other PR reps. Several of them wanted to make sure their celebrities were able to get pictures with Agatha and Wanda. Several young actresses were especially interested in being in Agatha‚Äôs orbit, and Rio was not amused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was trying very hard to keep down the emotions. She had been waiting for this for so long, and it was finally here. She would get to be seen, very publicly, with the true love of her life. They were skipping the whole girlfriend title, Jen putting them out there as partners. If she could, they would already be married, but even no-contest divorces in California took six months to finalize. No amount of fame could get around that. She and Agatha both tried.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still so surreal. I finally get to be public with her, and it‚Äôs absurd to me the way it happened,‚Äù she was trying to talk without moving her mouth, and after all these years, she and Agatha could understand each other perfectly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled and was promptly scolded, ‚ÄúWhen are you proposing?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAs soon as I fucking can. We know we‚Äôre getting married. We didn‚Äôt even have to have that discussion. I still want to give her the proposal she deserves. Enough about me, I‚Äôll get in trouble if I cry and ruin my makeup. When are you proposing?‚Äù Wanda grinned with her eyes as she was instructed to hold her mouth a certain way for lipstick.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha choked on her spit. ‚ÄúI just told her I love her, Wanda,‚Äù A chorus of ‚Äòawws‚Äô went up from everyone within earshot. ‚ÄúI am not ready to think about marriage,‚Äù It was mostly true. Agatha had absolutely thought about it, and even though she didn‚Äôt believe you had to get married, she wanted to. Just not anytime soon.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, please. You would move her in here yesterday if you could. The two of you have played house all winter break. Billy called her Aunt Rio yesterday, and no one blinked an eye. Raven practically lives here now.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs moving in, Wanda. Not marriage.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had thought about that one, though, and would suggest it when Rio‚Äôs lease came up for renewal this summer. Wanda rolled her eyes as she started getting dressed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAt least you‚Äôre moving faster than anyone else did around here.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The red carpet for the Golden Globes was crowded with interview stations set up everywhere and cameras constantly flashing. The audience area was full of screaming fans, and many celebrities were taking pictures or stopping near the area so their pictures could be taken. Agatha and Wanda were stopped continuously, which meant Nat and Rio were as well. Wagatha were two of the most sought-after celebrities on the carpet, as were their current headlines. Wanda had an upcoming interview with Drew and everyone had questions about what she was going to say, though her only answer was, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll just have to wait.‚Äù The two megastars were more than happy to talk about the film, talk up their fellow nominees, and gush about the women with them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With the hype surrounding
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Death‚Äôs Beloved,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Wanda and Agatha had used their red carpet looks to pay homage to their characters, as well as incorporate their signature colors. Wanda had gone with a one-shoulder floor-length black dress that was gathered at the right side with a ruby-encrusted silver skull, an ode to her role as a serial killer. The dress was cut up to her thigh on the same side and she wore red heels. Her hair was down in a side part, ruby red earrings that matched the heart necklace Nat gave her for Christmas.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda had convinced Nat to wear something that didn‚Äôt make her blend in or scream bodyguard, and Wanda was kicking herself for it because all Wanda wanted to do was skip the ceremony and go right back to the compound to their newly redesigned and refurnished bedroom and take the strapless dark red dress right back off Nat. Nat‚Äôs hair was up, and Wanda kept staring at Nat‚Äôs neck, thankful for makeup that covered the bruises and bitemarks Wanda may or may not have put there. Nat‚Äôs dress also had a high slit, and Wanda was making a mental note that Nat was to wear suits at awards shows for the rest of their lives, as she wondered if anyone would notice if they went missing for a while.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre drooling,‚Äù Agatha whispered in Wanda‚Äôs ear. ‚ÄúI get you‚Äôre making up for lost time, but you‚Äôre not ready for quickies at awards shows, angel. I‚Äôm the punchline for that joke in every single opening monologue.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew there would be at least one joke at her expense, most likely about her reputation. One year, it was a joke about looking under your seat for your designated time to meet up with Agatha in the bathroom. The joke was on them, though, that year. She had scoped out a room in the back and a beauty with whom to share it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had leaned into the FBI agent she played with a perfectly tailored suit. However, she opted for an eggplant purple corset underneath, her signature brooch perfectly in place, hair up in a twist, and the same purple stilettos she had worn on her first date with Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned to Rio and squeezed her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you ready for all of this?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave her girlfriend a comforting smile and a quick kiss on the cheek, grazing the corner of Rio‚Äôs mouth. Rio nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to get used to it, and I‚Äôve had media training from Jen.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs smile was electric and purely for Agatha. She hadn‚Äôt been in Agatha‚Äôs life when she made the movie, but she was still extremely proud of her and her accomplishments. Rio wore a forest green halter dress that came down to mid-thigh. It was draped on her left thigh in a way that showed off a silver thigh chain that had amethyst stones and an amethyst A. She wore black strappy heels, and her shooting star necklace, and her hair was in loose waves around her shoulders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They chatted with friends, and the starlets were pulled and directed several different ways. Rio received several hugs from students' parents, some of whom were nominated in the same categories as Agatha, Wanda, or the movie itself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once the chaos of the red carpet was over, they entered the main hall and found their seats. The host‚Äôs monologue started, and of course, several jokes were aimed at Agatha and Wanda, who at this point of their career, took it in stride.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sad day for the women in attendance. If you haven‚Äôt had your gay awakening yet, Hollywood‚Äôs sapphic tour guide, Agatha Harkness, is in a relationship and is no longer offering her services. In a surprising turn of events, the straightest woman ever, Wanda Maximmoff, is a¬† lesbian. So if any of you had ‚Äòhell freezes over‚Äô on your Bingo cards for this year, cross that one out.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDeath‚Äôs Beloved is set to win everything at every awards show this year. So, if you are nominated in a category against them, you may go ahead and go to your after-parties. Sorry, everyone.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There were jokes at Tony‚Äôs expense and a few of their other friends before getting started on the awards. The first category was Film Supporting Actress, Wanda‚Äôs category. Why was Wanda shocked when she won? The coven would never understand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda immediately turned and kissed Nat. For the first time accepting an award, she was fucking kissing Nat. She had been waiting for the moment she could thank Nat from a podium and it was finally happening. She was shaking and had frozen. Nat mouthed, ‚ÄòGo, this isn‚Äôt your first time, go!‚Äô
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grabbed Wanda‚Äôs hand and pulled her towards the stage. Wanda looked back at Nat, words formulating in her head. By the time they got to the mic and Wanda the award, Wanda nodded at Agatha, indicating she could handle it. Agatha stepped back next to the presenters.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took a deep breath and focused on Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt frozen when winning an award since I was a kid, and Agatha,‚Äù she looked at her best friend. ‚ÄúWas the one that dragged me to the stage then too. I have been waiting to say this on stage since I was in my twenties. Natasha, thank you so much for supporting me and always being there for me, you‚Äôve always been there for me. I love you so much.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Just the responses to that were deafening, and she laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRarely do thank you speeches get that kind of response. I‚Äôd also like to thank Vis, Billy, Tommy, Agatha, Alice, Rio, Nicky, and Jen for supporting me and being there for me for all of these years and being the best family I could have ever hoped for‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She thanked the usual people associated with the film and gave a heartfelt thank you to the fans before adding. ‚ÄúAlways live your truth. You, you can‚Äôt get back lost time.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked at Agatha, who grabbed her hand, and they walked off together. Nat met them backstage to go with Wanda to do a follow-up press interview, and Agatha went to get ready for her musical performance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>

      Rio checked in on social media, most of which was positive, and she put it back in her clutch. Agatha would be performing the song from the movie soon, and Rio was excited to see Agatha perform live, something Rio had never been able to do. Rio was very thankful for her position at SHIELD as Rio knew quite a few people in attendance, and even though her three table companions were currently missing, Rio still had people to talk to and didn‚Äôt feel out of place. They had come back from a commercial break, and the hostess commented on Wanda being the only person ever to thank a soon-to-be ex in an acceptance speech.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony announced Agatha, as the board always thought it was funny when the two of them presented or announced each other, as they infamously did not get along. This time, he added, ‚Äúthe woman who happened to partially raise my daughter‚Äôs boyfriend, though I attribute all of his good qualities to Wanda, Agatha Harkness.‚Äù They always tried to throw each other off their game.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had been prepared and, thanks to her in-ears, was completely unphased. The hauntingly beautiful melody began, and the spotlight fell on Agatha, who was wearing a black ball gown as she began to sing. Agatha‚Äôs eyes were on Rio the entire time, and the song was quickly becoming a favorite. The experience was over incredibly too soon, and she was covered in goosebumps.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Everyone had returned to the table, and Agatha was back in her original outfit, arm draped over Rio‚Äôs shoulders as they watched friends and acquaintances get flowers for their hard work over the past year.
     </span>

<span>
      lost Best Screenplay but won for Director and Score.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Best Song was up next, and while Agatha was used to this and calm, Rio was on edge. She had always been nervous watching from home, but being here, dating and in love with Agatha, was different and much more intense.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Agatha‚Äôs name was announced, she leaned over and whispered to Rio, ‚ÄúI save my big speeches, don‚Äôt get mad.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed Rio and made her way to the stage, where she met with the songwriters, making sure they went first. Then, she gave her very practiced Agatha Harkness smile and thirty-second speech. She thanked her family and friends, everyone who worked on the song, and that was it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda leaned over to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs taking a calculated risk,‚Äù Wanda explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôve seen this show before,‚Äù and Rio had. She knew that the older Agatha got, the less joint awards became about her. That wasn‚Äôt the case when Agatha was younger, but now it was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and everyone else were right back on the stage after the next commercial break for Film Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It had been a long evening, and it was only eight when the last four categories arrived. Two of which were theirs, Film Drama Actress and Film Drama. First up was the Actress category, and Rio squeezed Agatha‚Äôs hands as they went through the nominees. She knew Agatha was the favorite, and that was her calculated risk. Rio wasn‚Äôt surprised Agatha won, but she was still elated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha loved it when she won for her sapphic performances. This film hadn‚Äôt pushed an agenda, it was just the story, and that story happened to be queer. Agatha smiled as she kissed Rio, reaching back to smack Wanda on the shoulder as Wanda made snide comments behind her. When Agatha reached the stage, she blinked against the blinding lights and looked around the room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWow, thank you for this,‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs eyes fell on Rio. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôd like to thank Rio, my amazing girlfriend, for supporting me through the end of this past year and being there for all of us. I love you so much, and you are one of the best parts of my life. Thank you to my amazing family and friends. Wanda, thank you for convincingly playing my wife. That‚Äôs absolutely why we won tonight, and I am so proud of you, kid. Thank you to everyone who worked on this film and, most importantly, supported this film. Knowing that ALL stories are normalized now is truly a great thing to see, and I am so proud to be a part of it. To our boys, thank you for supporting us, and I am so proud of the young men you are becoming. Again, a huge thank you to everyone and all of you beautiful humans in this room. You‚Äôre all amazing.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha waved as she walked off to applause. She would do the media and press later. The movie was up for Film Drama in roughly ten minutes. She made her way back to the table, hugging people as she walked past them. She kissed Rio again as she sat down,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI love you, Agatha.‚Äù Were the first words out of Rio‚Äôs mouth once they broke the kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave her a genuine smile. ‚ÄúI love you, too. I am exhausted, though.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat leaned over Wanda to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAlmost done,¬† and put your shoes back on,‚Äù she instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had changed from heels to something more comfortable for most of the ceremony, Wanda and Agatha only changing when they were up for something.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave her a questioning look, and Agatha answered, ‚ÄúMore press after, babe.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed. ‚ÄúThe fact that I am wearing heels for you is a testament to my love.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>

      won, and the awards season was off to a great start. As they headed to an after-party, Rio was reminded that they all returned to the real world in a few days. Everyone would resume filming, work, or school on Wednesday, and she dreaded it. For now, she reveled in the fact that Agatha Harkness loved her and everything was right in their world.

     Chapter End Notes
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      The next chapter or two will be rainbows, butterflies, smut, social media reactions, all the smooth sailing things before we have some final drama.
     </p>
<p>
      The main fic will conclude at the end of SHIELD's school year. Then we'll have one-shots, lore, the Lorna story, the Swords story, etc.
     </p>
<p>
      I do post sneak peeks during the week, and pics of Raven as everything must meet her standards. Of course.
     </p>
<p>
      Y'all are amazing.

     Chapter Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Everything is calm and right in the world of our beloved coven. Agatha is filming and coming home on weekends, Rio has a new role at SHIELD, and Wanda has her interview with Drew.
     </p>
<p>
      A nice, calm month-ish with Oscar nominations, the Grammy's and a realization for Nicky.

     Chapter Notes
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Triggers: SMUT. Two scenes. SPICE. Bit of self-inflicted blood, the woman was feral, okay?
     </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
      The Grammy's will be a one-shot later, because this year's Grammy's were a hoot and a half and inserting Agatha and Rio sounds like a blast to me.
     </p>
<p>
      Note: I kept Sokovia as a real country, so Wanda's native language is Romanian (sticking to the show). Nat occasionally speaks to her in Romanian and Wanda speaks to Nat in Russian, because they're effing adorable.
     </p>
<p>
      Thank you all for the love and for reading the words! More fluffiness and potentially getting back to some drama next chapter...
     </p>
<p>
      Oh! I've been obsessing over curating the perfect 'soundtrack' (Spotify playlist) for the past week). I need your recommendations for songs for each chapter. Thanks!

      Rio just shook her head as she closed out of her socials. While some comments she could do without, some just made her laugh. Class started soon, and it would officially be the Spring semester at SHIELD. Agatha had left that morning, though she would be back on Friday. Rio was trying to readjust to being back in a routine, and her pack of teenagers calling her Ms. Vidal again. With all of the developments over the break, she was not surprised when Lilia strolled in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put her phone down. She looked up and saw a flustered Sicilian in front of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs eyes filled with concern as she checked the time. It was another fifteen minutes before students would be in class, and Lilia was usually in her office preparing for the morning announcements.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, I need you to fill in for Coach Carter for the girl's basketball team for the rest of the season.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio loved basketball. She had played for years, kept up with the WNBA, and used to coach. However, she didn‚Äôt think Lilia knew any of that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of the tallest actual lesbians on staff. I assume you play. Not to mention, you wear Phoenix Mercury shirts often. You played in college and coached at your last school. I did read your resume, Vidal.‚Äù Lilia kept looking at her phone as if waiting for a call or message at any moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDid Peggy go into labor this morning?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew Peggy was due soon. She was far enough along that the baby would be healthy, and that was the only reason she could think of for her to miss the rest of the season, though Rio could have sworn she saw Peggy in the lounge earlier.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot yet. Anyway, Daisy Johnson will fill you in on everything,‚Äù Lilia‚Äôs phone rang, and she answered automatically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, Steve, I‚Äôm on my way there right now. Go ahead and take her to the hospital, well, I told you both she would go early‚Ä¶‚Äù Lilia‚Äôs voice faded as she left Rio‚Äôs room and rushed down the hallway.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head as Alice popped her head in the doorway, ‚ÄúPeggy‚Äôs having a baby!‚Äù Alice said excitedly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know. Lilia just assigned me to the girls‚Äô basketball staff. She‚Äôs psychic, I swear. So unless you want to be stuck here after school, separate cars it is.‚Äù Rio explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBonding with your future daughter-in-law!‚Äù Alice grinned as she ducked back into the hallway when the rock-shaped stress ball sailed past Alice‚Äôs head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had decided to take lunch in her classroom so she could go over the folder Morgan had brought her from Coach Johnson. The roster, remaining schedule, and potential for the playoffs were all there. She wasn‚Äôt sure what athletic voodoo or super serums Rogers and Carter were potentially giving their athletes, but the girl‚Äôs basketball team was potentially better than the football team and had a better chance of going to state. Morgan, and a few of the other girls, were already being scouted by universities as juniors. SHIELD held many surprises and the sheer amount of budding athletes running around this place was one of them. According to Alice, this was the first year in at least a decade that the SHIELD Superstars had done well in any sports outside of track and archery. Rio hadn‚Äôt wanted to tell Lilia, but she was excited about the coaching opportunity. The season was cut short for her last year when her previous school pulled her from the coaching staff the millisecond she filed the restraining order against Lou.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She knew this was just for the rest of the year, and she was only the assistant coach, but it felt good to get back into it. She already had ideas for a staff vs. student game and hoped she could get on the court with the team. As she began reliving memories of her days playing in high school and college, she received a text from Agatha.

      Rio‚Äôs cheeks had turned a light shade of pink as the bell rang. They had been rather
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       inseparable
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      since the events of the previous week, and even though they had just parted this morning and would see each other Friday night, Rio felt like her heart had left the country.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Because a piece of it had, and that scared her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I am so fucking gay.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She thought before starting class.
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      Rio felt Agatha‚Äôs eyes watching her as soon as Agatha entered the gym Friday night. It was still early in the game, and they were tied. So far this season, the Superstars were undefeated, and the two coaches didn‚Äôt plan on letting them lose now. Rio had donned a black suit with a white button-up shirt, the top two buttons were undone, gold heels to stick to school colors, and her hair was clipped up. She held her clipboard as she shouted directions from the sidelines. She looked more like a college coach, which was what Rio preferred. She idolized women like Kim Mulkey and Pat Summit and always emulated that when she coached. Rio loved knowing that Agatha was now seeing Rio in her element: in control, wearing something she knew Agatha loved seeing on her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Coach Johnson now deferred to Rio and let her call the shots, and the team performed better following her lead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda leaned into Agatha, ‚ÄúDid Rio just dom Daisy for control of the team?‚Äù Wanda whispered into Agatha‚Äôs ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI think she did. Damn.‚Äù Agatha gave a low whistle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She preferred to be in control, but watching Rio coach was something she had never seen, and she had zero right to feel like this at a high school sporting event. Alice leaned forward from the row directly behind them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAt her previous school, parents with zero ties to the basketball team often showed up to support the team.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Their section was there to cheer on Morgan and support Rio. However, the merry band of Sapphics understood exactly why a parent would tell their kids they were going to support the basketball team just for fun.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky still had his arm in a cast, but Rio had allowed him to be on the sidelines and play water boy so he could be supportive. Rio had pulled Morgan out of the game for a few minutes because her temper was getting to her, and when Nicky tried to offer Morgan words of advice, she nearly bit his head off. Nicky sidled up to Rio and looked at her, confused. Rio didn‚Äôt take her eyes off the game.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNEVER tell a woman how to play their game, Nicky. You‚Äôre smarter than that. If you‚Äôve built up a - PLANT YOUR FEET KHAN, trusting and respectful relationship where you can give each other constructive criticism, then you can plan times for it. Never in the heat of the moment. LOOK AT CHAVEZ!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The game went to halftime, and Rio looked up at the tall teenager.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe never told you how to fix your aim when you threw an interception, remember that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio patted him on the shoulder and gave him a loving, motherly smile as the team went into the locker room for ten minutes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha saw the whole exchange, and while she couldn‚Äôt hear it, judging by the look on Rio‚Äôs face, it had been something sweet. Agatha had never planned on sharing her son with someone she was involved with, and she melted at the thought. That mixed with Rio‚Äôs confidence and domineering persona while coaching and Agatha wasn‚Äôt sure how she would make it through the rest of this game. Agatha turned to Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe might not make it back to the compound tonight.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, really?‚Äù Wanda deadpanned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had forgotten to load the auto-feeder for Raven. She lamented needing to stop by her apartment first when all she wanted to do was go home with Agatha. Agatha wasn‚Äôt mad at the lost time, as Rio saw it. Instead, she rode with Rio to the apartment to maximize what little time they had together before she had to be back on the set.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had barely stepped into the darkened apartment, Rio sitting her backpack down, when Agatha was on her, pushing Rio‚Äôs back against the door, pressing the fronts of their bodies flush together. Her mouth was on Rio‚Äôs in a needy kiss; one hand caressed Rio‚Äôs cheek softly, and the other gripped her hip tightly, Agatha‚Äôs nails leaving half-moons in her tanned skin. Rio carded her hand through Agatha‚Äôs hair at the base of her skull and placed the other hand on Agatha‚Äôs backside, massaging her buttcheek through the denim of Agatha‚Äôs jeans. Rio kissed Agatha back just as needily, pausing for a moment to look at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI missed you,‚Äù she rasped, staring into the ocean-blue eyes that felt like home.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled back. Rio‚Äôs eyes were already dark brown pools of desire.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù Agatha said, resuming the kiss before Rio could respond. Rio would never tire of Agatha Harkness saying those three powerful words.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha used her thigh to nudge Rio‚Äôs legs apart as she slid her denim-clad thigh right up against Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio whined at the slight friction, moving her hips to feel something more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha moved her hands to meet at Rio‚Äôs sternum and slid them up and under the suit jacket as she mirrored her movements across Rio‚Äôs collarbones, pushing the jacket off Rio‚Äôs shoulders. Agatha gave Rio just enough room to shimmy out of the jacket as it fell to the ground. She kissed along Rio‚Äôs jaw up to her ear, sucking her earlobe between her teeth. Rio let out a small hiss as she slid the hand that she had on Agatha‚Äôs ass to the hem of Agatha‚Äôs hoodie and tugged, still trying to feel something from Agatha‚Äôs thigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed, reluctantly pulling back a few inches from Rio, causing Rio to whimper as she moved her leg. Rio quickly removed Agatha‚Äôs hoodie and shirt together, throwing them on the ground as if their mere existence had personally offended Rio before attempting to tangle her hand in Agatha‚Äôs hair and resuming their kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pushed her back against the door and leaned in, right next to Rio‚Äôs ear, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still overdressed, coach.‚Äù Agatha made a long lick down Rio‚Äôs collarbone while expertly unbuttoning and discarding it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDoes someone have the hots for the coach?‚Äù Rio asked as her bra was removed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hummed an affirmation while she circled one nipple with her thumb while sucking a bruise on the side of Rio‚Äôs tit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio moaned at the sensations. Her clit was already pulsing, and heat in her lower abdomen continued to build. Agatha had admitted Coach Rio turned Agatha on. It didn‚Äôt matter how many times they had made love. Knowing Agatha was attracted to her would never get old.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI like it when you take charge.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha breathed across one of Rio‚Äôs hardened nipples. Rio grinned wickedly as she took a fistful of Agatha‚Äôs hair and used it to turn Agatha‚Äôs face upwards to look at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDrop to your knees, Harkness,‚Äù Rio growled, immediately releasing her hold on Agatha‚Äôs hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha dropped to her knees as she was told, raking her nails down Rio‚Äôs sides, kissing Rio‚Äôs stomach and along the waist of the black pants. Agatha loved the sounds Rio made and knew exactly where to touch and kiss to elicit them. Agatha‚Äôs hands continued down Rio‚Äôs thighs and she kissed her over the fabric, where Agatha knew Rio wanted her attention. Rio might be giving orders, but Agatha was still very much in control.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúUndress me, Harkness,‚Äù Rio ordered, and Agatha was more than pleased to oblige.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, Coach.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She grinned up at Rio and undid the two buttons, making a show of pulling the zipper down with her teeth, slowly sliding Rio‚Äôs pants off her legs, and leaving the gold heels. Agatha felt her stomach tighten as she rocked back on her heels and leaned back to take Rio in. Agatha raked her eyes over the woman she had against the door, wearing only gold heels and light green boy shorts that betrayed how aroused Rio was. Rio was beautiful, and Agatha planned to ruin her in the best of ways.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio glanced down before taking another fistful of Agatha‚Äôs hair and tugging her forward towards Rio‚Äôs cunt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe can do sweet later. Right now, you have a job to do.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, Coach.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grabbed the top of Rio‚Äôs panties with both hands and forcefully pulled them down, helping Rio out of them. The heels were staying on. Agatha lifted Rio‚Äôs right leg and hooked it over her shoulder, kissing Rio‚Äôs thigh in the process. She kissed and licked along where Rio‚Äôs inner thigh met her body, feeling the muscles already trembling against her cheek. Rio used her free hand to palm at one of her breasts, twisting her nipple. The hand still in Agatha‚Äôs hair attempted to pull her closer to where Rio needed Agatha‚Äôs mouth to be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúImpatient?‚Äù Agatha crooned, her mouth right above Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs body was on fire from just Agatha‚Äôs teasing, and she rocked her hips forward, searching. Agatha kissed across Rio, placing a very light kiss right above Rio‚Äôs clit, continuing to move to the other thigh. Rio used the grasp she had on Agatha‚Äôs hair to move her head back to where she needed it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she murmured, watching as Agatha flicked her eyes up to meet Rio‚Äôs and ran the flat of her tongue up Rio‚Äôs slit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio threw her head back against the door as Agatha held her steady, lapping at Rio‚Äôs entrance. Rio moved her hips in a steady rhythm against Agatha, desperate for more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tightened her grip on Rio‚Äôs thigh, using her other hand to spread Rio enough for Agatha‚Äôs tongue to thrust into her, keeping a steady pace. She knew Rio wanted hard and fast and would give her that. First, she wanted to taste her and build her up. Agatha had a long night planned. They had plenty of time for anything Rio wanted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHarkness,‚Äù Rio tried her best to go back to her coach's voice and failed. ‚ÄúEnough teasing. Make me‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her breath hitched, and she let out a loud low moan as Agatha‚Äôs tongue began flicking across her clit. Rio rutted against Agatha‚Äôs mouth and face, one hand tightly wound in her hair, the other firmly planted against the door, trying to hold herself steady.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs tongue alternated between circling and flicking around and across Rio‚Äôs pulsing clit, and Agatha knew Rio was close with how furiously she was fucking Agatha‚Äôs face and how blissfully loud she was. Agatha buried herself in Rio, increasing her rhythm and pressure when Rio‚Äôs entire body shuddered, Rio‚Äôs leg quaking against Agatha‚Äôs cheek as Rio cried out with pleasure, and Agatha steadied her as she rode out the orgasm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha carefully and slowly placed Rio‚Äôs foot on the ground as she stood, keeping a tight grip on Rio. Agatha wrapped an arm around Rio‚Äôs waist and took Rio‚Äôs chin in her other hand, kissing her hungrily, still pressing her back against the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTrust me?‚Äù Agatha breathlessly asked Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWith every fiber of my being,‚Äù Rio rasped, eyes blown as she gazed at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGood, because I‚Äôm just getting started. Wrap your arms around my shoulders,‚Äù Agatha instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio complied and was surprised when Agatha grasped the back of her thighs, picking her up effortlessly. Rio automatically wrapped her legs around Agatha and kissed her hungrily. Fingers splayed across the muscles of her upper back. Agatha carried Rio to the living room and stopped next to the arm of the couch. Rio was careful not to break the kiss as she set her own feet back on the floor and ran her hands down the lines of Agatha‚Äôs back, following the band of Agatha‚Äôs jeans where she undid the button and slowly unzipped them, pushing the pair of pants downward before Agatha kicked them off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs breath caught as Rio cupped her through the lace thong she wore. Rio could feel how much Agatha had been affected just by using her tongue on Rio. Agatha widened her stance and pushed Rio‚Äôs hand away, then turned Rio around, bringing Rio‚Äôs back against the front of Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready for you to touch me yet,‚Äù Agatha whispered, kissing the back of Rio‚Äôs neck and along her shoulders, Rio arching into the touch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBend over for me, Rio,‚Äù Agatha purred, and Rio obeyed, allowing Agatha to guide her a few steps before bending over the arm of the couch and bracing her elbows on the cushions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha positioned herself behind Rio, placed a hand on the small of Rio‚Äôs back, and slid the other between Rio‚Äôs legs, ghosting over a very wet core.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúStill wet?‚Äù Agatha teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded as she pushed her pelvis back towards Agatha. Agatha was rotating between circling Rio‚Äôs clit and dipping two fingertips into her entrance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was moving faster, trying to encourage Agatha to pick up the pace, and Agatha responded with hard thrusts to the knuckle. Rio gasped and leaned forward, pressing herself onto her forearms. Agatha leaned over Rio, kissing the back of her neck and shoulders anywhere she could reach. Rio‚Äôs movements became more frenzied as she drew closer, her head going fuzzy and her body clenching around Agatha‚Äôs fingers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It only took Agatha barely brushing against Rio‚Äôs clit with Agatha‚Äôs other hand for Rio‚Äôs head to fall forward as she completely gave over to the sensations. Agatha continued her movements, adding pressure and a third finger as Rio continued moaning, gasping, and encouraging Agatha on, never wanting her to stop.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Fingers curled as pressure was increased, and Rio‚Äôs back arched into Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it, baby, come for me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha bit into Rio‚Äôs shoulder as Rio gave a final cry. Agatha kept up with her movements until Rio begged her to stop. Agatha slowly and gently withdrew from Rio and helped her stand back up. Only then, helping Rio toe her heels off, keeping her arms wrapped firmly around Rio‚Äôs waist. Agatha felt Rio trembling, whether from their activities or being cold. It didn‚Äôt matter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRi, can you walk?‚Äù Agatha kissed into Rio‚Äôs hair as she held her against her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn‚Äôt wait for an answer. Agatha easily scooped Rio up in her arms like the princess she was and carried her into Rio‚Äôs bathroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis is not the bedroom,‚Äù Rio looked at Agatha, pupils still blown.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPee, clean up. I‚Äôm getting water, and I‚Äôll be back,‚Äù Agatha instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha returned to the bedroom to see an empty bed, except for a very judgmental cat. She placed the water on the nightstand and turned to find Rio when her eyes landed on her, leaning against the door frame of the bathroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio still felt a bit wobbly and wasn‚Äôt quite ready for more, but had taken a moment to just appreciate Agatha for who she was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSee something you like?‚Äù Agatha held out her hand and led Rio to the bed. Agatha had taken off her now useless thong, and Rio appreciated that, too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI see someone I love very much,‚Äù Rio settled next to Agatha after she drank a healthy amount of water.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGah, we‚Äôre cheesy,‚Äù Agatha scoffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged. ‚ÄúWe are, but no one has ever carried me during or after sex just to make sure I don‚Äôt hurt myself. You‚Äôre the only lover I‚Äôve ever had that gave a damn about aftercare. You think it‚Äôs important that I have a few moments to recover before I make you forget your name,‚Äù Rio winked at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMy ego is too big for me ever to forget my name.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wrong.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio kissed Agatha on the cheek as she grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about these moments either. You support me. You spent a Friday night at a high school basketball game because I was coaching. You‚Äôve sat next to me memorizing lines while I lesson planned, even before we were technically dating.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio caressed Agatha‚Äôs cheek, overwhelmed with the amount of love she had for this woman in such a short amount of time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat do you mean technically dating? We started doing things like that early on. End of August? We both had work to do but wanted to have a movie night still,‚Äù Agatha huffed and smirked. ‚ÄúWe really did fall into a routine that was not exactly friends, didn‚Äôt we?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúA few weeks in, and we couldn‚Äôt stay overnight somewhere without sharing a bed. Aggie, what do you think?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled to where she was partially on top of Agatha and kissed her sweetly before deepening it. The night was still somewhat young, and neither of them planned on getting much sleep.
     </span>
</p>

      Wanda took a deep breath as she looked over herself in the mirror. Her makeup was perfect for the HD cameras, still with America‚Äôs sweetheart vibes. Her hair was partially pulled back, and she wore a black jumpsuit with a red blazer. She looked very Wanda Maximoff‚Ñ¢ Wife, Mother, Girl-Next-Door. Wanda sighed as she put the necklace from Nat back on. The stylist that told her not to wear it could fuck off. She took off the wedding ring that some producer insisted she wear, though Wanda nor Drew liked that idea. Wanda and Vision had naturally stopped wearing their rings on Christmas when they announced their divorce to the world. She wasn‚Äôt putting it back on for an interview. Wanda loosened a few strands of hair, so they framed her face and unbuttoned the blazer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAsta pare mai natural,‚Äù
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       now that looks more natural,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Nat walked into their bedroom, where Wanda had been getting ready. The interview was being held at home as a special interest piece, not a part of Drew‚Äôs regular show.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe only person I want to be,‚Äù Wanda turned away from the mirror and kissed the woman next to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you ready to do this?‚Äù Nat‚Äôs eyes searched Wanda‚Äôs for any hint of doubt. Nat and Jen would shut this down in an instant if Wanda weren‚Äôt ready.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am, finally. Whatever happens, we can face it,‚Äù Wanda smiled brightly and went in for another kiss. ‚ÄúYa tebya lyublyu.‚Äù
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I love you.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat took Wanda‚Äôs hand to lead her downstairs. There were no threats here, but Nat would always do what she could to keep Wanda protected from anything, even if it were just stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTe iubesc.‚Äù
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I love you.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda and Drew were now sitting in the living room for the question part of the interview. They had walked around outside, and moved around different parts of the house, showing Wanda Maximoff the person, not the megastar. It would be edited together to show a normal afternoon between Drew and Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Of course, the background story left out how they actually met and went with the ‚Äòmet while out partying with Agatha‚Äô, which was partially true.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had made the story a bit more suitable for public consumption, though they left the important points about how the industry could curate how someone was perceived, such as the need to be closeted if you were packaged and branded in a certain way, and the need to hide who she was for so long.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWanda, you and I are close friends, and we‚Äôve known each other since we were teenagers,‚Äù Drew smiled genuinely. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve discussed all of these questions, so none of these are surprises,‚Äù Drew added the disclaimer so neither of their fanbases would be upset when the update aired.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRight, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre the only person I would do this interview with. We know too many things about each other to not be honest.‚Äù Wanda smiled, and they both laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Drew put a comforting hand on Wanda‚Äôs knee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúReady?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it.‚Äù Wanda took a breath, knowing that she was about to get a mix of general and fan questions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDid Vis know?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat question right off the bat? Well, as I said, when I was going through the history, I was always upfront with Vision. When he and I first started dating, he knew about Nat. When we got engaged as a PR response to the leaked pictures, he suggested we call off the engagement. Vis has always known, and there was never any dishonesty there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI did have beards, though he was not one, and they are all out now and extremely encouraging of this. I have always had Agatha‚Äôs support. She truly is my family, and I always had Natasha and Vision‚Äôs support. I never meant to betray or lie to anyone. It just grew into something bigger than myself.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Drew blinked away a tear. ‚ÄúWhat about the boys?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They all had workshopped and practiced this answer to make sure she wouldn‚Äôt be skewered for anything she said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe boys have always known, even though we never said anything. We thought not telling them was the right thing to do. That way, we didn‚Äôt have to worry about anything leaking, the boys saying anything, etc. We just raised them all together. Agatha had Nicky, and he automatically had four parents. Then, when Vis and I had the twins, we did the same thing. We did tell them before this came out on Christmas since we had decided to separate and announce everything after the first of the year. The timing was just a few weeks earlier than planned.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo the twins are okay with everything?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAbsolutely. Nothing is technically changing for them, just where the adults live. No custody battles, no smear campaigns, we will just be a larger and slightly more dispersed family.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They went through a few more questions that fans had asked to keep her image squeaky clean. No, no one was cheating. No, again, it wasn‚Äôt a bearding situation. Yes, their love had been real once. Yes, the boys were biologically Wanda and Vision‚Äôs, red and blonde did make brown hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Drew looked at Wanda, the loving and adoring friend.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAs we wrap up, what would you tell others who may find themselves in this situation? Or anyone faced with a similar situation?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda returned a watery smile. ‚ÄúAlways be yourself, and don‚Äôt hide who you are. I have received so much overwhelming support, and even if I hadn‚Äôt back then, I would have come back from it. We can‚Äôt get back that time, and while I don‚Äôt regret anything, Vis and I both know that we should have separated years ago but stayed together for the sake of my career, afraid of what could happen. However, I have truly been the happiest I‚Äôve ever been since coming out and making this life-altering decision, and he has been too.‚Äù Wanda looked past the cameras to where Vision and Nat stood, smiling proudly at her. Vision nodded in agreement, and Wanda focused back on Drew, ‚Äúso again, be yourself and do what‚Äôs best for you and your family and this is what is best for ours.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda closed the laptop and set it aside. She and Vision had just watched the edited interview, and they were both pleased with how it turned out. He gave her a squeeze around the shoulders and a kiss on the temple. She laid her head on his shoulder, and they sat like that for a few quiet moments. They would always be an integral part of each other‚Äôs lives, with a closeness that would always be there. Wanda was thankful that Nat understood the dynamic and was okay with the pet name, head kisses, and otherwise intimate gestures. Wanda worried that any future partner of Vision‚Äôs would not feel the same way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúVis, do you think you‚Äôll date?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúActually, darling, I was going to talk to you about that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda sat up and turned to face him. ‚ÄúI was just asking as a hypothetical, what?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He chuckled. ‚ÄúJealous?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSurprised, actually.‚Äù Her eyes were wide. He had never so much as glanced at another woman in all the time she had known him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never mentioned another woman to me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vision grinned at her, waiting for it to hit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHoly shit. It‚Äôs not a woman.‚Äù She stated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He shook his head, ‚ÄúNo, there is a man however,‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS HERB!‚Äù Wanda blurted. Herb was another professor at UCLA and had been Vision‚Äôs racquetball partner for years. ‚ÄúRacquetball indeed, sir!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe are just racquetball partners and colleagues, though there is an interest there. When the story broke, he did text to offer his condolences, though the emojis he used suggested that he was not upset about it,‚Äù Vision recalled with a smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda did not need the details of that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy for you, Vision,‚Äù she hugged him and kissed him on the cheek. She loved the life they had curated on the compound, even if Vision would be moving off of it in a few weeks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúStill moving into the house a few blocks away or waiting to see how things go with Herb?‚Äù She teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot a lesbian.‚Äù He reminded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh shit, I owe people money,‚Äù She remembered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDid you have a betting pool going?‚Äù He deadpanned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have betting pools on everything.‚Äù
     </span>

      Rio did not like Agatha being gone for longer than a weekend, and she wasn‚Äôt sure how she would handle it when she was on an entirely different continent for months. They were still newly dating, and when they were together, they couldn‚Äôt take their hands off each other. It was Wednesday of the second week, and filming had been extended through the rest of January. Agatha would be home on Friday, but three days was apparently too long for Rio. They had spent the entire weekend together, most of it naked, and yet‚Ä¶
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was getting into bed when the text popped up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

      In my suitcase. You wouldn‚Äôt

<p>
<span>
      would you?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled. She knew exactly what Agatha was referring to. She had bought a set of wearable vibrators for them. They were controlled by apps on their phones. She was wondering when Agatha would find it or notice the new app on her phone.

      the next best thing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha loved technology. She set the U-shaped vibrator aside and grabbed her iPad. She would need a bigger screen for this experience. She brought up a secure connection and then the FaceTime app and waited for it to connect to Rio‚Äôs iPad.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat was fast,‚Äù Rio laughed as she answered. She was wearing a Witches Road sweatshirt with Agatha‚Äôs name scrawled across it, black glasses, and Agatha saw a glimpse of purple briefs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMenopause has heightened my libido,‚Äù Agatha deadpanned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIs that your excuse?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou helped,‚Äù Agatha answered truthfully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio blushed. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want to do this‚Ä¶‚Äù She started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI very much want to do this. I want to tie you to the bed and make you take my cock, but unfortunately‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was already lightly touching herself. When it came to Rio, she was constantly on. Anywhere, anytime. She had a mental list of fantasies, but they hadn‚Äôt even covered a fraction of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs mouth went dry remembering the one time they had incorporated the strap-on and how she‚Äôd like to bring that out again. She loved it when Agatha tied her down and wanted to explore everything with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo, we have plans for the weekend, is what I‚Äôm hearing.‚Äù She tried to sound sexy and failed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       kitten
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , we‚Äôll go at your pace.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio poked her tongue in her cheek at the mention of their safeword, ‚Äòkittens‚Äô.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWant to tell me about these plans?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio placed the iPad so that Agatha could see all of Rio and not miss anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha situated her iPad before taking her oversized sweatshirt off, she hadn‚Äôt been wearing any underwear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt got very hot in here all of a sudden.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúLamest excuse in the book, but I‚Äôm not complaining.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took in the view, watching Agatha ghost a hand over her breast. How was she so effortlessly sexy? Rio reached down to tug her sweatshirt off when she heard Agatha tsk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, that stays on. I want to watch you come with my name across your chest,‚Äù the tone of Agatha‚Äôs voice was commanding and dripped with want and desire.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all yours, Agatha.‚Äù Rio bit her lip as her eyes followed Agatha‚Äôs hand on the screen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha trailed her hand down her toned stomach and to her pussy. She placed the vibrator and phone right in front of her for when they were ready. Agatha looked straight into the camera at Rio. ‚ÄúTake off your briefs and spread your legs,‚Äù Agatha commanded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio loved it when Agatha was demanding, but the added distance made it even hotter somehow. She slid her underwear down her legs and tried to kick them off sexily, only for them to get caught on her ankle, and she turned bright red before shyly spreading her legs. Rio wasn‚Äôt shy. She was just slightly embarrassed by her failure.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha ignored it, dragging a finger through her folds while honing in on Rio. ‚ÄúGood girl,‚Äù Agatha purred, erasing all hints of embarrassment from Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A quiet moan echoed in Rio‚Äôs throat from the praise and the sight of Agatha. Rio hadn‚Äôt even touched herself, and she was wet. The things Agatha Harkness did to her were beyond explanation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúCan you insert your vibrator, baby?‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs voice came from the device. She knew Rio was probably already ready for the toy, and Agatha knew she was ready.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, grabbing for the toy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù Agatha growled. ‚ÄúSo am I. Put the toy in your wet pussy so I can fuck you with it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs eyes were loving, commanding, and predatory at the same time. The intensity heightened the moment even more for Rio as she inserted the vibrator and positioned it on her G-spot, placing the other end on her clit. She would adjust as needed. Rio watched as Agatha placed hers, and they both pulled up the app. Agatha read Rio‚Äôs mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in control of it, and if I want anything specific, I‚Äôll tell you. For yours, well, when you need to tap it out, the word is kittens.‚Äù Agatha smiled at her scandalously. They had talked about boundaries previously, and Agatha knew that Rio wanted her to take charge like this and would put an end to it if she needed to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gasped as the bulb inside of her began at a low thrum, the part on her clit at the same speed. Rio looked at the options on the app. She knew Agatha enjoyed higher pressure and started her off at a medium vibration on her G-spot and a medium tapping on her clit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMorse code mode?‚Äù Agatha raised an eyebrow after her initial shock.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know what a good dash-dot-dash does to you,‚Äù Rio smirked, remembering the time she spelled out
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Rio
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      in Morse code with her tongue on Agatha‚Äôs clit. She shuddered as Agatha slightly increased the intensity of the vibrations.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat plans do you have for us?‚Äù Rio asked, slightly moving her hips in vain for more friction, legs still spread for Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was in a similar position to Rio, noting that the tapping had changed to vibrating as her eyelids fluttered in response. ‚ÄúMany,‚Äù she responded seductively, only for Rio to stop all stimulation, causing Agatha to pout.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no‚Ä¶‚Äù She was cut off as Agatha turned both intensities completely up, which was not the retaliation Rio was expecting. She braced her feet on the bed, and her toes curled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFUCK! AG‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was gone immediately. Agatha had turned it off. When Rio looked back at the screen, there was Agatha, grinning from ear to ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mess with the master, kid. Now, are you going to be a good girl?‚Äù Agatha dropped back into the sexy and seductive voice Rio loved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù Rio whimpered with a pout.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs better, baby.‚Äù She turned Rio‚Äôs toy back on, slightly increasing it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed into the sensations. She loved their dynamic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wiggled against the bed, finding the perfect amount of friction. ‚ÄúThis weekend, I plan to tie you down, wrists and ankles, so that I am in complete control.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was massaging her inner thigh, envisioning being tied down to Agatha‚Äôs bed. Agatha, with her hand on Rio‚Äôs throat when she kissed her. Rio felt the intensity grow as she increased Agatha‚Äôs by two levels.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha bit back a moan, describing her weekend wishes to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI want to leave my marks across your chest and down your stomach. Scratch your thigh for me, baby,‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs mouth watered when Rio took both hands on either side of her core and scraped them up her thighs, automatically leaving marks and drawing a little blood. Rio gasped with the sensation, and Agatha knew that Rio was dizzy with the stimulation. Agatha increased the intensity, watching hungrily as Rio pressed the toy into her and bucked against it, swearing and saying Agatha‚Äôs name, her eyes slammed tight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wasn‚Äôt going to let her come, not yet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh baby, you‚Äôre so close for me, and I can‚Äôt even touch you,‚Äù Agatha teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGod, Agatha. I‚Äôm going to co‚Ä¶‚Äù The intensity returned to low, and Rio‚Äôs eyes flew open in desperation. ‚ÄúNo, baby, I was such a good girl,‚Äù Rio whined.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, baby, you were. I wasn‚Äôt ready for my sweet girl to come yet.‚Äù Agatha cooed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio melted every time Agatha used any type of affirmation for her. It only added to everything she was feeling. Rio turned Agatha‚Äôs sensations up, watching as her pupils dilated more, and Agatha tried to steady her breathing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSet it to cycle so you don‚Äôt lose focus, baby. Medium for three, high for two, low for one. Do that for one cycle, and then as high as it will go.‚Äù Agatha instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at her skeptically as she followed the directions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNow, set that aside and focus,‚Äù Agatha directed. She could tell the pressure was building again, and Rio needed release. ‚ÄúWhile leaving marks on you, I‚Äôll play with your hard clit, drawing circles around it in the way you like.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha increased the levels of intensity again and stimulated her own breast and nipple with her free hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll beg for my fingers and tongue, but you won‚Äôt get them.‚Äù She added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had pressed the toy against herself again, trying to get as much pressure and sensation as possible, Agatha increasing it again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWill you let me have your cock?‚Äù Rio panted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, baby. I‚Äôll undo your ankles so you can wrap those legs around me while I thrust into you.‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs breath kept catching as she neared coming undone. Her brain was getting increasingly hazy, and she was dripping as much as Rio was. She saw how much Rio was desperately trying to hold on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat do you want, Rio?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMake me come, please, Agatha. I want to be a good girl for you,‚Äù Rio begged into the camera.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pressed the buttons and watched Rio‚Äôs mouth drop open wordlessly. Agatha‚Äôs timing was perfect when her own vibrator hit max intensity, and her body began to jerk and spasm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh God, Rio!‚Äù She cried out, the orgasm ripping through Agatha as she refused to let up, riding back-to-back orgasms, enjoying the delicious intensity of it until she had to press the off button that was on the side of the toy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, FUCK.‚Äù Rio closed her legs, only making the pressure more intense, separating them once again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha forced her eyes open so she could watch Rio, and just as she had imagined, watching Rio lose all control, with Agatha‚Äôs name across her chest, was one of the most beautiful things she had ever seen. Agatha didn‚Äôt own Rio, and she didn‚Äôt believe she did. However, Rio was giving a piece of herself to Agatha, and she was fully Rio‚Äôs as well. Rio spasmed again as Agatha turned the toy down to the lowest level.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my sweet Rio. I wish I could be there with you, baby. I promise to make it up to you this weekend.‚Äù Agatha took her in, realizing just how fucking lucky she was. ‚ÄúAgain?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked into the camera, ‚ÄúAgatha? Kittens.‚Äù

      Alice clicked through the different tabs she had open for wedding venues, trying to narrow it down as she yelled in frustration. This startled Jen, who sat in their bed next to her on what was otherwise a nice, quiet Wednesday evening. Jen‚Äôs townhouse had sold, and she had moved in with Alice while their house on the compound was being built.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked over at Alice with amusement as she closed the book she was reading. She knew what Alice had been working on and had found it entertaining how seriously Alice was taking the entire process. Alice slammed the computer closed and placed it on the nightstand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo. Everything‚Äôs either booked out for over a year, or there‚Äôs a minimum guest requirement. I don‚Äôt need a huge wedding. I need you, our friends, and an officiant. And I want to get married around Spring Break,‚Äù Alice slumped against the headboard and looked over at her fianc√©e. ‚ÄúIs that too much to ask?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smiled softly at Alice and placed a hand on her shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we elope? Or, well, elope but take the core people because Rio would murder me if she weren‚Äôt there. We can have a big reception after.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A slow smile started to form as Alice thought it over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe get married at the beginning of break, have a short honeymoon, you will take me on a longer one later, and have a reception the following Saturday before we go back to school?‚Äù Alice thought out loud. Jen‚Äôs own smile widened.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a date. Want to do the cliche Vegas wedding?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMy mother would personally haunt me if I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù Alice huffed a small laugh. ‚ÄúWe still need a venue, though.‚Äù Alice started to worry again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGood thing we know a guy that loves a good party.‚Äù Jen returned her book to her nightstand and turned off the light. ‚ÄúNow kiss me, and let‚Äôs go to sleep. One of us has teenagers to wrangle tomorrow, and thankfully, it‚Äôs not me.‚Äù
     </span>

</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDude, it‚Äôs time to talk with her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tommy Maximoff said Wednesday night. The three boys were sprawled around the game room at the Maximoff house, where they usually camped out when Nicky stayed with them if Aunt Aggie was out of town. The room was dark, and they were supposed to be asleep. Instead, they talked through Nicky‚Äôs current dilemma.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy had created a nest of cushions and blankets and looked toward Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou love her and need to see how compatible this will be,‚Äù he added to his brother.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky sighed. He was on a couch, curled under a blanket.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. How do I even approach the conversation with my mom?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tommy scrunched his nose from the TaunTaun sleeping bag he insisted on sleeping in. ‚ÄúWhy do you have to ask Aunt Aggie?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs her house? And her girlfriend!‚Äù Billy shot towards his brother.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky sighed. He loved his younger cousins.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have to tell Mom where I‚Äôm at with Rio. Mom is obviously serious about her. We‚Äôve all seen it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTotal simp,‚Äù Billy agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Nicky confirmed. ‚ÄúWhile I love staying here, Aunt Wanda and Aunt Nat need to be able to be together with you two as an actual family unit.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Aunt Nat had finally moved in with Aunt Wanda, and Nicky was so happy for them. Uncle Vis decided to stay at the clubhouse until his house closed, and the place never looked so clean or organized.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tommy snickered, ‚ÄúNothing has changed. Nat‚Äôs always been a mom figure. Now they just kiss in front of us.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey play tonsil hockey in front of us,‚Äù Billy clarified.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad our moms had the foresight to soundproof bedrooms.‚Äù Nicky mused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYOUR mom did that. Our mom did not. We are scarred for life.‚Äù Tommy informed him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAnyway,‚Äù Nicky continued, ‚ÄúI need to ask Mom if Rio can stay the rest of the filming schedule at House of Harkness so we can bond more. I should just be honest with her, right?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was more rhetorical than anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, she needs to know that you want to learn more about Rio and how her living in the house would go. Also, cat bonus.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy grinned. All three boys loved Raven and always hoped she‚Äôd be at Aunt Aggie‚Äôs when Rio was there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm gonna text her.‚Äù Nicky nodded decidedly.
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      It‚Äôs nothing bad, I promise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha read the text over and over. It was 10:30 on a school night. He should be asleep.

<span>
      No. It can wait until Friday. I want to talk to you in person.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chewed at the skin on the side of her ring finger. Was the other shoe about to drop? Was this about Morgan? Or even worse, Rio? Was Tony about to murder him for something Nicky did? The possibilities were endless when it came to her son as she stared at the phone. She wondered if there was a possibility she could get home early, but knew there wasn‚Äôt. She had to film until late afternoon and wouldn‚Äôt be home until around noon on Friday. She was thankful they followed an American schedule and had a four-day weekend with SHIELD.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She huffed, and where she would normally pick Wanda‚Äôs brain, it was Rio who she texted, even though they had just hung up from their very spirited FaceTime session.

<p>
<span>
      His arm is doing well and he‚Äôs on

<p>
<span>
      track to have his cast removed,
     </span>

<span>
      Nicky was waiting at home when Agatha arrived on Friday. He was on the phone with Morgan and hung up when he saw his mother come in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey, mom! Can we talk once you get settled?‚Äù He asked, still somewhat anxious about the whole thing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha picked up on his nerves and immediately started thinking of worst-case scenarios. Had he cheated on Morgan? Committed felonies? She had always been very upfront with him to stick to basic misdemeanors. Was this about Rio? Agatha dropped her things on the end of one of the couches before settling in her usual spot and patting the spot next to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúCome sit, kid. Tell me everything.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky took a huge breath as he trudged toward her, the death march playing in his head. He plopped onto the couch and lowered his eyes with a sigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about Rio, mom.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha deflated. She would always put her son first, even if it meant losing the woman she loved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù She nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to her, and we‚Äôll put an‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky‚Äôs head popped up, ‚ÄúWhat?! Wait! Mom, what do you think I‚Äôm about to say?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tilted her head and gave him a look of pure confusion.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat you don‚Äôt like Rio, that you want me to break up with her?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh! God! Mom! NO!‚Äù He was bewildered. For someone so smart, how could she be so bad at reading her own son? ‚ÄúNo, I want her to come stay with me while you finish filming!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He rushed the words, only to see more confusion on his mother‚Äôs face, and he continued to rush forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe twins need time to get settled into new routines and having Nat as even more of a mom, and Vis needs time to adjust to being somewhat single. Rio and I need to see how well we would do without you here as a buffer since you won‚Äôt be here every day. I know I have to ask her, but I have to ask you first since she is your girlfriend, and it‚Äôs your house, Mom. I just know you two are serious about one another and if the next logical step, no matter when it is, is her moving in with us, then we have to know how well we cohabitate.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was panting after the word vomiting he had just done when he looked up at his mother, who was, crying?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMom, I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pulled him into a tight hug. ‚ÄúI love you so much, Nicholas.‚Äù She pulled back and looked at her son, truly her number one. ‚ÄúYes, we can talk to Rio and see what she thinks. It‚Äôs up to her, and we don‚Äôt want to scare her off, got it?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky nodded and grinned. ‚ÄúMom, she‚Äôs seen you first thing in the morning, no makeup, giant glasses, full-on morning breath. You couldn‚Äôt scare her away if you tried.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha attempted to give him the mom look, ‚ÄúYou, sir, are an asshole.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He returned one of her signature smirks, ‚ÄúI learned from the best.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha couldn‚Äôt help but smile. She had taught him well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had come over shortly after Agatha and Nicky‚Äôs conversation, with Raven in tow. They ate dinner at the kitchen table, and Rio was somewhat suspicious of Nicky‚Äôs presence since he spent all of his time with the twins or Morgan. After Nicky cleared the dishes, he sat back at the table and looked at Rio very seriously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, Mom and I were talking, and since changes are happening at Aunt Wanda‚Äôs house, and I want to stay in this house more, will you stay here with me while Mom is filming?‚Äù His face was hopeful, and he looked much younger than sixteen at that moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned toward her girlfriend, ‚ÄúAre you sure? I‚Äôd be parenting him a few days a week. Are you sure you‚Äôre okay with that?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you going to let him do anything stupid?‚Äù Agatha countered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot intentionally, no,‚Äù Rio answered honestly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen yes. I would love to know that you are caring for o‚Ä¶my son. Waking up in ou‚Ä¶my bed every morning. I just wish I was next to you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was stroking her hand up and down Rio‚Äôs thigh and looking at her softly. Nicky cleared his throat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, you guys are doing that thing where you make it weird and gross, so I‚Äôm leaving now.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He waved as he left to meet the twins at the clubhouse.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked back at Agatha, ‚ÄúYou almost said ‚Äòour‚Äô twice.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha put a finger to her lips in thought, ‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt recall that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSure you don‚Äôt.‚Äù Rio smiled before turning serious. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure you trust me with him?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha held Rio‚Äôs hand and ran the pad of her thumb across her knuckles.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course I do, why wouldn‚Äôt I? If you can keep a roomful of teenagers alive around open flames and chemicals, you can keep one of them alive for a few days.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Raven gave a meow of doubt from a few feet away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve kept you alive, you traitor.‚Äù Rio glared.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once Agatha had left, it was easy for Nicky and Rio to establish a routine. When they got home from basketball practice, Nicky did his homework while Rio made dinner, and they cleaned up the kitchen together. With Coach Carter‚Äôs blessing, she appointed him a coaching assistant, and they would go over different plays and drills. Morgan would sometimes come over after practice, and Rio would have to play the mean mom by not letting them go anywhere in the house unoccupied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even if it was just a few days, she thought she was doing a pretty good job, and they were bonding over video games, music, and other common interests. They FaceTimed with Agatha for the Oscar announcements, but they were only slightly surprised when both Wanda and Agatha were nominated for Best Actress. Rio had Agatha on Facetime as they got ready for school and watched the broadcast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was thrilled that Wanda had been nominated for lead and really hoped that her sister would win instead of her. Agatha and Rio chatted a bit more before they hung up. Rio looked at Nicky, who had also been watching them as they sat in her classroom early.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He sighed. ‚ÄúIs it bad that I do hope Aunt Wanda wins more than Mom?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thought about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, not at all. Your mom wins a lot in everything. Wanda is amazing, and so was her performance. However, the people who vote for The Oscars, well, a lot of them are going to feel betrayed and lied to.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew that as stupid as it was, there was a possibility that Wanda would lose votes solely because of what Lou did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really stupid,‚Äù he grumbled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI agree with you. People live vicariously through celebrities and put too much pressure on them to live a certain way. Just because Wanda should get the Oscar doesn‚Äôt mean she will, and it‚Äôs not right or fair.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky nodded and looked at Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really insightful, considering you‚Äôre not that old.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smirked. ‚ÄúThanks, it‚Äôs the trauma.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was another Friday night basketball game, and Agatha wasn‚Äôt going to get in until late due to filming. Nicky‚Äôs cast was off as he gestured wildly on the sidelines, and both lead coaches shouted at the team.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNicky! You‚Äôre not a coach. Sit down!‚Äù Daisy yelled at Nicky, face red, and steam practically radiated from her ears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou just called a play that we didn‚Äôt have the right people for, and it was disastrous because you didn‚Äôt want to let Rio call it!‚Äù he spat back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBoth of you! Nicky, you know better than disrespecting an adult and undermining the coach in public. And Daisy, he is a child. Both of you, cool it!‚Äù Rio barked before turning back to the team on the court.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Daisy turned to Nicky and did not see him as a student at that moment but as yet another member of the Rio Vidal Fan Club.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt care about you. She‚Äôs just trying to get to your mother.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her words were meant to sting, and they did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was a Harkness, through and through, and did not back down. His mother had taught him not to fight women, but he was about to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just jealous because she‚Äôs a better coach and, apparently, better for my Mom.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He was fuming, and the Harkness temper was about to come out when Rio called a time-out and stood in front of him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDaisy,‚Äù Rio said calmly. ‚ÄúIt sounds like this is between you and me, not something to take out on my son. I will finish this game without you. You‚Äôre dismissed.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Daisy opened her mouth to protest, and Rio gave her The Look‚Ñ¢. Daisy closed her mouth and turned on her heel, only to see Lilia Calderu giving her a similar look as Daisy followed Lilia out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio quickly turned to Nicky to see him looking pale and staring at Rio. She put a comforting hand on his arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGo sit with Wanda and calm down, okay? I‚Äôll kick her ass in the parking lot. Go.‚Äù She jerked her head in the direction of the bleachers. He gave her a small smile and went to find the rest of his family.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio realized the team had gone relatively silent, as had much of the crowd. She shrugged and turned back to the team.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúStop gawking. Time-out is over, and we‚Äôre about to lose. Let‚Äôs go!‚Äù She shouted as everyone snapped back into action.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky recounted the scene with Daisy to his aunts, uncle, and cousins. He looked at his Aunt Wanda,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe called me her son. I don‚Äôt think she even caught it. I know we‚Äôve joked about it, but‚Äù he shook his head and took a deep breath. ‚ÄúI need to talk to my Mom.‚Äù He finished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be home later tonight.‚Äù She assured. She couldn‚Äôt imagine how Nicky was feeling. She rubbed his back as he kept his eyes on Rio. Morgan glanced up at him questioningly, and he gave her a thumbs up. The other teenager didn‚Äôt believe he was okay either.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Smart Girl.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Wanda thought before texting the events to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio got her head back into the game, and SHIELD barely won. She would need to talk to Coach Carter in their next catch-up about what happened. The team debriefed, and Rio walked back through the gym, knowing everyone else had already left, when she saw Lilia waiting for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou did great with Daisy.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio scoffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat was that about, anyway?‚Äù She asked as Lilia fell into step with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDaisy is still young. She had her chance to emerge from Peggy‚Äôs shadow, and you immediately eclipsed her in the first game. You have done what no other woman before could do and stole Agatha Harkness‚Äôs heart, something most teachers here have tried. You have endeared even the most stubborn of parents to you, several students are highlighting teenage bullying and inequality in schools across America, you nudged Wanda Maximoff out of the most see-through glass closet, and you finally forced Alice and Jen to admit their feelings. You didn‚Äôt expect jealousy?‚Äù Lilia looked at the younger woman expectantly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not speaking riddles,‚Äù Rio parroted Agatha from months ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why everyone points that out. For some reason, new life makes me even more observant,‚Äù Lilia mused, referencing Steve and Peggy‚Äôs newborn son, James.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù Rio studied Lilia for a moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy me, Lilia? Why offer me the position and bring me out here?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia hadn‚Äôt known her. She just came to San Francisco at Alice‚Äôs request last Spring and offered her the position.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI trust Alice, and she wanted to keep you safe. I knew you would be a good fit, and you have been, in many ways. Now, I have a few security things to take care of. Start prepping for playoffs, coach!‚Äù With that, Lilia walked off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt made it that far!‚Äù Rio called after her, but the woman didn‚Äôt reply.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky made it home to the compound before Rio did. He had given Morgan a quick hug and kiss before promising to call before bed. He was relieved to see his Mom as he sat next to her and buried his head on her shoulder like a little kid.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDid Aunt Wanda tell you what happened?‚Äù He asked in a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She ran soothing fingers through his hair like she often did when he was a little boy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, and I‚Äôve talked to Lilia.‚Äù She had also verbally eviscerated Daisy, but he didn‚Äôt need to know that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio called me her son.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI heard. How do you feel about that?‚Äù Agatha still wasn‚Äôt sure how she felt about it. She loved it and was scared at the time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHonestly?‚Äù He pulled back and looked her in the eye.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHonestly. No cap, or whatever the kids are saying,‚Äù She gave him a sarcastic smile as he groaned. Parents should not use teen slang.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky thought about it, letting the words marinate. ‚ÄúI know we‚Äôve joked, and I‚Äôve called her dad, which is still funny because it‚Äôs Rio, and she gives those vibes,‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFair.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs always been you and me. Aunt Wanda, Uncle Vis, and Aunt Nat too, but you know what I mean,‚Äù Nicky looked up through long, thick eyelashes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew exactly what Nicky meant. He would always have this family, but Agatha was his anchor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI love her mom, and she‚Äôs a good addition to our family. I don‚Äôt want to say a missing piece because we aren‚Äôt incomplete, though we were sorely lacking in the ancient cat god department,‚Äù he said as Raven jumped into his lap and purred.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI think those choose the human, not the other way around,‚Äù Agatha mused. ‚ÄúWhat part about it scares you?‚Äù Her stomach dropped at the look on his face. ‚ÄúRight. Still me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDo you blame me, Mom? I got into an argument with a grown adult because she‚Äôs jealous of your girlfriend as she‚Äôs one of I don‚Äôt even want to think of how many women you‚Äôve slept with. I‚Äôve defended you since I was a kid. I should not know this much about my mom‚Äôs extra-curricular activities. I‚Äôm sorry if I worry.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had always tried to keep her hobbies away from Nicky but knew he would be exposed to them, no matter how hard she tried.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have changed, Nicholas.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know, Mom. Just know that she really is becoming like a mom to me, even if it hasn‚Äôt been that long, okay? Or at least until I get in major trouble and she has to put her foot down. I might change my mind then.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Headlights washed over them as Rio drove up the long driveway.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my cue since you two tend to get gross. I love you, Mom,‚Äù he hugged her before heading up to his room, Raven in his arms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha woke up the Monday morning after the Grammy‚Äôs, thankful there was no school and that she could hold Rio in her arms. The ceremony had been a celebration of women, queerness, POC, and just fun. Rio had been a pure chaos demon with Taylor, and Agatha had taken it all in. Agatha had won her third Grammy, and while that technically gave her her triple EGOT, she wasn‚Äôt counting it until she won her third Oscar for Best Lead Actress. She was an overachiever after all. She had thanked Rio first last night, causing several of her friends in the industry had lost their minds, including the younger sapphics in the crowd. It truly was a great night, and she looked forward to always having Rio next to her as her forever date for these events and all of the memories they would create.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her phone brought her out of the lavender haze as Nat texted the group chat, instructing everyone to put their clothes on and meet in Agatha‚Äôs living room in forty-five minutes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy MY house?‚Äù Agatha grumbled as she kissed Rio awake.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Forty minutes later, everyone was in Agatha‚Äôs living room with the TV on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúCare to fill us in, Nat?‚Äù Agatha asked, nursing her second large thermos of coffee and still grumpy about being awake at eight in the morning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI received some information last week, and this morning, one of my‚Ä¶shadow associates, if you will, told me to watch the news at this time. So here we are.‚Äù Nat was focused on the TV.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys were groggy but had been dragged from their beds for this. Jen and Vis were the only two that looked put together, the others all looked as if they put on the nearest, cleanest, most acceptable articles of clothing and game over or downstairs, which is what they had done.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHush, it‚Äôs starting!‚Äù Wanda quieted everyone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBreaking news! Out of San Francisco,‚Äù The reporter started. ‚ÄúWe go now to recently disgraced supermodel Lou Franco‚Äôs house where the FBI has identified her as the person behind many high profile jewelry thefts‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The color completely drained from Rio‚Äôs face as she clapped a hand over her mouth, and the other rubbed those too-familiar circles on the left side of her chest. She wasn't sure why she was anxious or crying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was Lou, glaring into the camera, in handcuffs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      All eyes in the room landed on Rio. Agatha put her arms around her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over,‚Äù¬† she whispered into Rio‚Äôs ear.‚Äù in an attempt to soothe her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen turned to Nat, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you finally do it?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat stood there, watching the oversized screen, taking it all in. Yes, she had gotten documents and fingerprints, but they weren‚Äôt necessarily the ones that would tie all the heists together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this.‚Äù Nat started. ‚Äú I provided some evidence to an associate, but this wasn‚Äôt me,‚Äù her voice was low and hollow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhoever it was, they‚Äôre on our side, and we can breathe more easily,‚Äù she said assuredly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at the screen. Things were going well at school. She was coaching again, Wanda and Nat only had a few months until they could get married, Jen and Alice were beginning to plan their wedding, all the boys were doing well, Vis was settling into his life, the boys were doing great, and she and Agatha were doing well. The Oscars and Spring Break were coming up, and best of all, Lou was gone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked back at the screen just in time to see Lou look into the camera as her lips curled into an evil smile, ‚ÄúTe veo, pet,‚Äù she mouthed before passing out dramatically as the camera cut off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I see you.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just shook her head. ‚ÄúNope, bitch is gone, and all is well.‚Äù She decided.
     </span>
</p>

<p>
     It was Valentine‚Äôs Day, and as cliche as it was, Wanda was going to propose. She was tired of waiting, and with everything finally being calm, now was a good time. She looked down at the dark wooden box in her hand, opening it to reveal the black titanium engagement ring inlaid with red diamonds and a red ruby in the center. The ring had never been worn despite being purchased over twenty years ago.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‚ÄúAggie, I‚Äôm going to propose to Nat,‚Äù Twenty-four-year-old Wanda Maximoff said decisively to thirty-year-old Agatha Harkness.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha was sitting in the living room of the house in LA, which they shared with Nat, who was out on a run. She set down the script she was reading and looked at the young girl in front of her.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‚ÄúOh honey, do you think you‚Äôre ready for that? What about Vision?‚Äù
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Wanda had thought of that.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‚ÄúYes, and I love him so much Aggie, but Nat is the one. I don‚Äôt care what the fans say,‚Äù Wanda sat down next to the woman who had become her older sister over the past eight years.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha smiled and extended her hand, ‚ÄúLet me see the ring.‚Äù
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‚ÄúHow do you know I have a ring?‚Äù Wanda asked indignantly.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‚ÄúBecause you always do this when you see rings that remind you of her. I assume you saw the perfect ring, no one was there to tell you no, and you bought it.‚Äù
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Wanda‚Äôs entire face flushed. Agatha could read anyone, especially Wanda. She sheepishly handed Agatha the box, pouting that the older woman had been partially right.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‚ÄúClose, I saw one I liked and had this, and the matching band custom made.‚Äù
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha opened it with a smirk, having been proven mostly correct, and let out a sad sigh when she saw the ring.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‚ÄúOh, angel, it‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She looked at Wanda with a sad expression, gripping her hand.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‚ÄúYou WILL get to put it on her hand one day, and I will be by your side either as your Maid of Honor or the one giving you away.‚Äù
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Wanda nodded, a tear sliding down her cheek. She knew Agatha was right. Wanda wouldn‚Äôt have the courage to do it, no matter how much she wanted to spend her life with Natasha.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda closed the box and tucked it in the pocket of her maxi dress. Agatha had been right. The concert had happened a few days later, and everything after that was a blur. Here they were, over two decades later, and Wanda would finally get to propose. She had her speech, decorated the gazebo out back, and planned what to make for dinner. Everything was ready down to the music; she had practically grown up in the movie industry, so the cinematics were inevitable.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat could be covered in mud and wearing a potato sack, and Wanda would still think she was the most gorgeous being in the universe. Wanda knew she would remember the jeans and Lilith Fair hoodie Nat was wearing for the rest of their lives as they sat outside watching the sunset on the cold February evening around the firepit in the gazebo, drinking hot chocolate and snuggling together after dinner. It had been a quiet Valentine‚Äôs evening at home, which was precisely what they had wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDo you remember our first Valentine‚Äôs together?‚Äù Wanda asked, moving closer to Nat.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat smiled at the memory.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe were living at the clubhouse, and Agatha was still teaching us how to cook. You were much better at it than I was, though that‚Äôs not saying much. You tried to make Beef Wellington and almost burned the house down. We had to order pizza, and then we watched
     <em>
      But I‚Äôm A Cheerleader
     </em>
     for the hundredth time. Agatha was gone that night, and when she got home, she laughed for a good ten minutes.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda laughed at the story. ‚ÄúI was trying so hard to impress you!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt need to! We had been together for a few months, and I was already completely in love with you. You could‚Äôve made me a Hot Pocket, and it would‚Äôve been the best day ever,‚Äù Nat took Wanda‚Äôs hand and looked at her with pure love.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhat about the first concert we went to?‚Äù Wanda prodded, eyes dropping down to Nat‚Äôs hoodie.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚Äú1998 Lilith Fair. I spent most of the festival trying to keep track of Agatha. You and I, however, danced very inappropriately to Missy Elliot, considering we were just friends and I was your bodyguard...‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou were definitely guarding my body,‚Äù Wanda interjected.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat smirked as she continued, ‚Äúand gave new meaning to the song ‚ÄòSomething to Talk About‚Äô.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda just grinned. ‚ÄúWe do cause a commotion at concerts, don‚Äôt we? Spice Girls, Warped Tour, NSYNC, Madonna, Lollapalooza,‚Äù they had been to so many over the years, she couldn‚Äôt begin to name them all. ‚ÄúGood thing we can be out now.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMusic is important to us, and we tend to get carried away. Now we can.‚Äù Nat leaned forward, kissing Wanda. ‚ÄúMy turn to ask a question: do you remember the first time I officially acted as your bodyguard?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYES! It was for the Emmys! Agatha and I were up for Sisters! I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at you in that suit! I should‚Äôve known I wasn‚Äôt straight, but I kept telling myself I was just envious that you pulled it off so well.‚Äù Wanda laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSolnyitza, you should have known. Every guy you were set up with was PR. Nothing happened with any of them. Vis was the first and only man you ever did anything with, including unscripted kissing,‚Äù Nat reminded.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda thought back on all of her so-called relationships.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúGood point. However, the same can be said about you, zvezdochka, star. You‚Äôve been the only woman for me,‚Äù She scoffed. ‚ÄúForty-five, and I‚Äôm still the girl next door.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúForty-six in two days,‚Äù Nat reminded.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRemember my thirtieth birthday?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAgatha threw you that eighties-themed birthday party and made everyone dress as their favorite eighties character! It was so cute! I still don‚Äôt know why you got so mad at her.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda huffed, ‚ÄúBecause Nicky was almost one, and what no one else saw was Agatha teasing me all night about how I wasn‚Äôt getting any younger and I needed to choose my baby daddy,‚Äù She rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúShe also brought Nicky over earlier that day in a shirt that said, ‚ÄòI love my aunts and uncle‚Äô. Lorna kept telling Agatha to lay off.‚Äù Wanda shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIf it weren‚Äôt for Agatha, I never would have met the love of my life,‚Äù Nat caressed Wanda‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúBesides, you have two baby daddies. Those are my boys, too.‚Äù Nat pulled Wanda in for another sweet kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     When they parted, Wanda looked up at Nat, glad that her plan was going the way she wanted. ‚ÄúDo you remember when we found out I was pregnant?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Nat‚Äôs face softened, a smile still on her lips as the clear visual came into her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never forget it. You came out of the bathroom, test in hand, and we stared at it for what seemed like forever. We were in Budapest on a set, and you had gotten sick. You thought you were just sick when the doctor on hand sent you to your trailer with a pregnancy test. We watched in agony as it turned positive, and even though we weren‚Äôt technically together, I was so happy. You weren‚Äôt mine, no, but Wanda, I was always yours, and I am so grateful that I was allowed to be there every step of the way. You called Vis, and he told you he knew you were in good hands for the rest of the shoot.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda was trying not to cry, and while she had more memories to bring up, she knew it was time.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMoya zvezdochka, my star, I‚Äôm getting cold. Will you grab a blanket from the chest?‚Äù Wanda asked, giving Nat her best puppy dog eyes. Nat rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou have two perfectly good legs, but yes, solnyitza, sunshine, I will.‚Äù Nat got up and walked across the gazebo to fetch the blanket in question.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNat, do you remember the time I proposed?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be silly, you‚Äôve never‚Ä¶‚Äù the words died in her throat as she turned around to see Wanda down on one knee, holding an open box with the most beautiful ring Nat had ever seen. The blanket fell from her hands as a hand flew to cover her mouth, and tears filled her eyes. It was finally happening. Her feet propelled themselves toward Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     As she cleared her throat, Wanda had tears of her own, watching Natasha walk toward her. ‚ÄúNatasha, I have loved you for twenty-five years, and I so badly want to be yours. You have been by my side through every up and down in my life since I was eighteen. You were the first woman I ever kissed, the only woman I‚Äôve ever loved, and one of the few people I‚Äôve shared everything with. You are a parent to my sons, the person I want to fall asleep next to every night, and the person I wake up to every morning. So many of my best memories are with you, and I want to create more of them for however many years we have left. I want to grow old with you, make out at concerts, and actually impress you with my cooking skills now that I can,‚Äù Wanda laughed through her tears, remembering the multiple cooking failures they had both had. ‚ÄúYou are the one I want by my side at every event, in every picture, in every way imaginable.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI have wanted to put this ring on your finger for so long and never thought this day would come. I know this is the most cliche day to ask you this. Natasha, you are the love of my life, the person I have been madly in love with since we were kids, who patiently waited for me, who supported all of my decisions, maddening as they were. Will you finally marry me?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Tears streamed down Wanda‚Äôs face as she looked into Nat‚Äôs eyes, awaiting her response.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat had knelt in front of Wanda, tears of her own mirroring Wanda‚Äôs as she nodded. She held out her shaking left hand as Wanda slid the ring on her finger.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYes, Wanda. I will absolutely marry you. No matter what day you asked me.‚Äù She smirked, swiping at her tears. ‚ÄúYou have always been it for me, and I would have been content just being here, a part of your world. Being with you again is something I had only dreamed of.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Nat leaned forward, hands clasped in between them. She slid her lips against Wanda‚Äôs, bringing a hand to Wanda‚Äôs cheek, and smiled into the kiss. It was sweet and slow, tips of tongues swiping across each other, not quite going deeper. Wanda whimpered as Nat pulled back.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOne moment, √Ængera»ô, angel,‚Äù Nat stood up and brought Wanda with her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the only one that has been holding on to something for a ridiculously long time. I was trying to wait until your birthday.‚Äù Nat said, fishing a box out from the pocket of her hoodie.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúBecause that‚Äôs not just as cheesy.‚Äù Wanda sniffed, new tears creeping from her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou still win on that.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Nat laughed as she opened the box, revealing a gold ring with a ruby heart. The band was braided with a row of diamonds on either side.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWanda, when you sent that text a few months back, my heart stopped. I watched you play house for decades, and I would do it again and again if it meant being even a fraction of your life. You asking if you could be mine were words I never thought I would see or hear. They were wishes and dreams. I couldn‚Äôt get back here, back to you, fast enough. We have loved each other in secret and lived for the stolen moments for so long, and to finally be ourselves has been freeing and amazing. But know that I would do it again and again if it meant that I would still get to be with you. I love you so much, Wanda, the Sunshine in my day. Will you marry me?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda was ugly crying, and she knew it.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou already said yes,‚Äù Wanda sobbed a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúJust give me this.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYes, my North Star, I will marry you.‚Äù Wanda grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat placed the ring on Wanda‚Äôs finger, wrapping her arms around Wanda‚Äôs waist and kissing her passionately before turning off the firepit and leading her to their bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had never planned an actual Valentine‚Äôs Day. She had absolutely ‚Äòcelebrated,‚Äô but a proper date? It had never been her thing in the past. She had tried with Swords but had been shot down. Maybe it was time to start tackling the Swords' trauma with her therapist. She shoved the thoughts aside. Tonight was not the night for those memories. Rio had offered to plan the night, but this was something Agatha wanted to do.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Except her plans were shot when Rio turned into Coach Vidal, and there was a basketball game on fucking Valentine‚Äôs Day. The rest of the coven didn‚Äôt even come since her kid was the only one technically involved, and her girlfriend was the coach. She could salvage it, right? But then, it was a doubleheader, and Rio was coaching both JV and varsity due to the JV coaches having some mystery flu. Calderu had suspended Daisy from coaching until March, and no matter how much Agatha had tried, Lilia hadn‚Äôt let up.
    </p>
<p>
     That‚Äôs how Agatha found herself in the gym at SHIELD, cheering alongside the Starks and the Langs, wearing a SHIELD jersey with VIDAL Number 13 across the back.
    </p>
<p>
     Tony smirked, leaning across Pepper to talk to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI never thought I‚Äôd see the day Agatha Harkness had another woman‚Äôs name on her,‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never thought I‚Äôd see the day Pepper would give you your balls back, and what do you know? I still haven‚Äôt,‚Äù Agatha shot back to Pepper‚Äôs laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúShe has you there, honey,‚Äù Pepper added.
    </p>
<p>
     Tony turned bright red.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúGood thing Nicky learned from his other parents,‚Äù he grumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúFor the most part,‚Äù Agatha smirked before turning to Pepper as Tony returned to his original place. ‚ÄúMorgan is a really great kid. Are you sure it‚Äôs okay for Nicky to take her out after this without an adult chaperone?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky and Morgan had planned to go out to a diner and a late movie with a pass, stating it was a school event. If they did get pulled over and caught, Agatha and Tony planned to play the megastar and extremely famous director card to get around the California state minor driver rules. Misdemeanors, not felonies and all that.
    </p>
<p>
     Pepper smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI trust them both to make good choices, and I trust you two to get them out of any trouble they could potentially get into. By that, I mean I trust our collective legal teams,‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSmart girl,‚Äù Agatha smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     They continued to cheer the team on. Junior varsity had already played, though they still sat on the bench out of support and respect. Tommy had come along to support Cassie Lang. They were ‚Äòhanging out‚Äô and not necessarily dating. Neither of them wanted labels, stating that they were too young for that and only freshmen. Yet if you asked Billy, he and Eddie were going to get married, Eddie was going to be a doctor, Billie would follow in his mother‚Äôs footsteps, and they would have two point five children, two cats, matching Subarus, and work closely with LGBTQIA+ organizations. The twins could finish each other‚Äôs sentences but were as different as night and day.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned to watch Rio and Nicky as they coached in sync. They made a great team, and it made her heart flutter. Rio was back at her apartment during the week now that filming had wrapped up, and Nicky missed her. Agatha hadn‚Äôt addressed the ‚ÄòMy Son‚Äô comment with Rio, and Rio hadn‚Äôt brought it up, but Agatha found Rio catching herself slipping and purposely not saying it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was lost in her thoughts when she felt eyes on her and looked over to see Lilia staring at her, the old bat. Agatha just glared at her and flipped her off. She was still mad about the basketball game situation. Lilia rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     SHIELD won yet another game and Agatha said her goodbyes to the other parents while waiting for Rio when Lilia pulled her aside.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù Agatha said coldly.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt remain angry at me for a schedule created before I made Rio the coach,‚Äù Lilia said with an exasperated sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI can be rather stubborn.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm painfully aware Agatha. You can still have a good night and watch your movies. She has tests to grade this weekend, no matter where she is. Also, she had a rough day. Just be there for her, not whatever extravagant thing you tried to plan to sweep her off her feet with tonight,‚Äù Lilia suggested.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou are the one to be giving me romantic advice? Why the sudden interest?‚Äù Agatha asked suspiciously.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúEven Hollywood playboys deserve to settle down eventually, no matter with whom, Agatha. Besides, happy coaches win games. Winning games leads to state. Winning state propels the school,‚Äù Lilia smiled. ‚ÄúIt may also be time to address when she called him ‚Äúher son‚Äù - everyone heard it, and I am sure you haven‚Äôt approached it.‚Äù She added before turning away and briskly walking away with a wave over her shoulder. Agatha had known the woman forever, and she was still often confused by her. She shook her head as she turned to see Rio headed toward her, looking exhausted.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took Agatha‚Äôs hand, kissing its back. ‚ÄúI love the jersey, m‚Äôlady,‚Äù she looked around as the gym cleared out, eyes landing on Morgan and Nicky as the teens walked up to them.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre headed out, and I‚Äôll be home by curfew,‚Äù both teens hugged the women.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up at her son. ‚ÄúBe very careful. Watch for deer and insane blondes, got it?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYes, Mom,‚Äù he hugged her again and looked at Rio, ‚ÄúAnother great night.‚Äù He waved as he took Morgan‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúGood night, Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day. Love you, Moms!‚Äù Nicky flashed another smile, and they left.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to Agatha, ‚ÄúDid he call me mom in a non-joking manner?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHe did.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio remembered the last time she became attached to someone else‚Äôs children. Three blonde kids she would still do anything for. The oldest was in college now and all three crossed her mind occasionally. She couldn‚Äôt take losing another kid, set really, as she considered the twins partially hers as well.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe should probably discuss this.‚Äù Rio‚Äôs face was solemn as she watched Nicky and Morgan leave the gym.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMy house?‚Äù Agatha watched Rio carefully. She knew Rio had referred to it as home before but didn‚Äôt want to push it right now.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYour house. Where‚Äôs Tommy?‚Äù Rio scanned the gym for the Maximoff they were supposed to be in charge of.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHe went with Cassie and family for pizza and a game night. Vision will pick him up later.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the kids call ‚Äòhanging out‚Äô these days?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     They started walking to Rio‚Äôs car as they continued their conversation.¬† Agatha shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so different from when I was a kid. Then again, I snuck around on movie sets and in trailers. My teenage dating life wasn‚Äôt really typical.‚Äù Agatha recalled.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened the car door for Rio like she always did, and Rio rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo wonder you make all the women swoon,‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm oozing with charm.‚Äù Agatha leaned in, kissing Rio. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry our first manufactured day of love isn‚Äôt more romantic.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSpoken like Agatha Harkness. Let‚Äôs go back to the compound and talk about the whole son thing. We‚Äôve been pushing it off long enough. Then we‚Äôll go from there, okay?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They sat on the couch, a movie playing in the background.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAre you okay that I called Nicky my son? It really did just slip,‚Äù Rio asked, drinking a cider and watching Agatha‚Äôs expressions.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought about it, and I am. It surprised me at first, but more because I‚Äôve never had a serious romantic partner that I saw as his other parent before. Swords came around when he was born, and I think she considered it for a minute but ultimately decided against it.‚Äù Something dark slid over Agatha‚Äôs face.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI mean, she bailed after the first pregnancy ended. I shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised when there was an actual baby.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hated this Swords bitch. ‚ÄúBut you have concerns,‚Äù Rio surmised.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNicky is still concerned about the me factor,‚Äù Agatha confirmed with a sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHe loves you. He trusts you. You are becoming another mom to him, and it scares him how fast it‚Äôs happening. However, there‚Äôs still my past and reputation. I‚Äôm not exactly the poster child for steady relationships.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you for communicating and being open and honest.‚Äù Rio wanted to validate Agatha before she shut down. Sometimes, she had to treat her with teacher gloves. ‚ÄúI love him very much, as if he were my own, but it did happen very quickly, and I can back off some. I‚Äôm still going to be protective of him, but if I overstep, just tell me. I love you and will respect all of your boundaries.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDamn Rio. I am a powerful woman, and you just come in here, break down my walls, and make me completely vulnerable in every way except physically.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI have a gift,‚Äù Rio smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNow, I heard you had a bad day. Come here and tell me all about it,‚Äù Agatha adjusted so Rio could lay against her and vent all she needed to.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI teach high schoolers, and it was Valentine‚Äôs Day. I also had the freshman biology class dissect sheep hearts, so that was fun. Do you know how many students I had to pull apart from each other today? Khan and Chavez were like sapphic bunnies. They were EVERYWHERE too! I do have a very decent supply of candy and chocolate in my desk drawers, though, and I ran a carload of flowers and stuffed animals home after school before the game.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha almost interrupted her to tell her she didn‚Äôt see any of those things around until she remembered Rio meant her apartment and not Agatha‚Äôs house. Rio was still recounting her day.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThe gifts do not matter to me, but it‚Äôs so sweet that they bring me things, especially at this level. So that wasn‚Äôt bad. I could‚Äôve done without some of the teasing from the jealous teachers though.‚Äù Rio rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúLilia keeps shutting it down, and then I feel like a teacher‚Äôs pet. I still love my job and wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything, but I‚Äôm about to take Nat to work with me one day. My yearly evaluation is coming up soon, too. I‚Äôm worried the coworker dynamic will affect it.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ran her nails along Rio‚Äôs scalp.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt, baby. There‚Äôs nothing to worry about.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSays Agatha Fucking Harkness. Oh! That reminds me, I got you something. It‚Äôs in my school bag,‚Äù Rio hopped up from the couch and retrieved a card from her bag that she had sat at the table. When she returned, Agatha was holding a gift box of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked around, trying to determine the origin of the box.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI hid it under the couch,‚Äù Agatha said cooly.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOf course you did. It‚Äôs not much, but here, you go first because I went first at Christmas,‚Äù Rio instructed as she sat back on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYes, Coach,‚Äù Agatha handed Rio the box, opening the envelope. The card was sweet and held tickets to the Beach Life Festival for the first weekend of May.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mainly for Alanis, Train, Sublime, Lenny...okay, there‚Äôs a lot of people we like. I thought we could make a weekend out of it since it‚Äôs a four-day weekend for us anyway.‚Äù Rio pushed her hair behind her ear, looking down sheepishly. Agatha leaned forward and kissed her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI love it and look forward to making memories with you. However, I think we‚Äôre beginning to think alike. Open yours.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head questioningly as she opened the box revealing plane tickets that had ‚ÄòHarkness Airlines‚Äô on them with Lima, Peru as the destination, tickets to see Shakira, and a pack of gum.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIs this because of how badly my ears popped the last flight?‚Äù Rio laughed as Agatha nodded. Rio looked closely at the dates. ‚ÄúWait, Aggie, this says we leave tomorrow!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúConcert is Monday, got you out of your teacher workday on Tuesday, and Lilia took care of Wednesday for you. I couldn‚Äôt get you out of the game tonight, but I did get you out of Wednesday. Alice, Wanda, and I packed for you. Alice and Jen will Raven sit. Lesson plans are also taken care of, courtesy of one of your backups that you already had in your Google Drive.‚Äù Agatha had planned everything.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAgatha Fucking Harkness, if I wasn‚Äôt exhausted‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always time for that later. It‚Äôs a 9-hour flight. Now, let‚Äôs get those sore muscles of yours into a hot bath, and I will take care of you, my love.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs breath caught at the new pet name,
     <em>
      my love.
     </em>
     That was the one, the one that fit them the best.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSo why did you choose Shakira?‚Äù Rio asked Agatha as they cuddled on the private jet.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI appreciate your Latin roots. Also, it‚Äôs Shakira,‚Äù Agatha trailed her fingers up and down Rio‚Äôs spine.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI liked her better as a brunette, and I prefer her older stuff, Ms. Know-it-all,‚Äù Rio began to sing ‚ÄúPerteneciste a una raza antigua, De pies descalzos y de sue√±os blancos.‚Äù then kissed Agatha‚Äôs neck, eliciting a sound from her girlfriend that made her thankful the few crew members were back in the enclosed area of the jet.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou do have a type, and I may have made a few requests for the set list,‚Äù Agatha put an arm around Rio, pulling Rio onto her lap. ‚ÄúI love when you sing to me.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took the hint and straddled Agatha, wrapping her arms around Agatha‚Äôs shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHow did I get so lucky?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gazed into the sapphire blue eyes of Agatha Harkness. In them, she saw the hope and promise of their future and at the same time, she still wasn‚Äôt sure what their future was. They hadn‚Äôt been together that long, but she still wondered.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI believe I‚Äôm the lucky one here, my love,‚Äù Agatha kissed the hollow of Rio‚Äôs neck. ‚ÄúYou came to LA and all.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pushed other thoughts aside as she leaned down and kissed Agatha. The kiss quickly turned heated. Rio sucked on Agatha‚Äôs tongue before breaking away, gasping for air. ‚ÄúYou know, I am not a Mile High Club member,‚Äù she smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned as she reached for a remote and turned off the lights in the cabin. ‚ÄúI believe we can remedy that.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     As they entered their suite in Peru hours later, Rio entered the bedroom and collapsed on the bed. Jetlagged and exhausted from their in-flight activities. With customs, the flight, a three-hour time difference, and getting checked in, it was nearly midnight, and Rio was ready to sleep for the next twenty-four hours.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAre you going to change first?‚Äù Agatha lay next to her and slung an arm across Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI took my shoes off, and I‚Äôm tired,‚Äù Rio muttered back as Agatha‚Äôs phone went off, the ringtone indicating it was Jen. ‚ÄúI love her, but it‚Äôs midnight, and she knows where we are.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned as she answered, and Jen‚Äôs face appeared on the screen. ‚ÄúWe could have been naked,‚Äù Agatha said in place of a greeting.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNothing I haven‚Äôt seen before. Anyway, is your other half around?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou can see her next to me.‚Äù Agatha moved the phone more to show Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo, the redheaded one.‚Äù Jen rolled her eyes as if it were obvious who she meant.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs and her birthday weekend. Nicky‚Äôs staying with the twins and Vision. Wanda and Nat won‚Äôt surface until we get back, most likely. Why?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWait, you‚Äôre in Peru without Nat?‚Äù Jen looked alarmed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not stupid, Kale. We do have security with us. I know I can‚Äôt go anywhere without an armed bodyguard,‚Äù Agatha huffed. It was not something she liked about her fame. ‚ÄúGet on with it. Why are you calling me this late at night and looking for Wanda, too?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI have had a flurry of phone calls and e-mails, and you‚Äôre both about to be very busy women‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm already a busy woman,‚Äù Agatha turned her head and grinned at Rio as Jen rolled her eyes again.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúStop acting like a teenage boy and go into global megastar mode, please?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha disgruntedly blew a strand of hair out of her face as Rio suppressed a giggle.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen carried on, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had requests to present at a few awards shows and accepted them, the Spirit awards, you‚Äôre presenting at the Oscars for Supporting Actress, then the SAG, QUEERTIES, GLAAD, and you‚Äôre nominated at all of them. That‚Äôs for now, though we know there will be the Emmys, possibly the Tonys, and who knows what else.
    </p>
<p>
     Then there‚Äôs press for the TV show, all the late-night shows, the morning shows, the talk shows. Everyone wants you, Agatha, and we‚Äôre giving you to them. Marvel and Disney are starting table reads, alternating, in May. However, they need you in for some things in April. The show needs some additional filming next month, and it looks like your summer will be packed. Wanda‚Äôs too, probably.‚Äù Jen finished and looked at Agatha expectantly.
    </p>
<p>
     Both Agatha and Rio were sitting up now. Rio was trying to take everything in.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWait, what about the festival in May? Coachella? Spring Break? Your wedding and reception? Prom? There are some important things we had planned,‚Äù Rio looked between the phone and Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put her hand on Rio‚Äôs shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWelcome to the reality of being me. The past few months were a break period. Now everything is kicking into high gear. I‚Äôm sure Jen worked out a few non-negotiables, but some sacrifices will have to be made. Weekends are generally free, most shoots are Monday through Friday, and we can only work five consecutive days a row. Thank you, SAG-Aftra. Spring Break is probably one of those sacrifices, though,‚Äù Agatha turned back to the phone to confirm her suspicions.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen was nodding. ‚ÄúI was able to negotiate your music festivals. Coachella was easy. Most celebrities go. Nicky‚Äôs junior prom is safe, and our Vegas wedding and the reception are safe. Your Spring Break plans are not. Agatha, you‚Äôll be making the promotion rounds that week.‚Äù Jen gave Rio a sad smile, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. I hate to be the bearer of bad news this weekend, but I had to sync calendars and deliver the news as soon as I could.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI understand, mood killer,‚Äù Agatha smirked. ‚ÄúSend me the itinerary for Spring Break, please, once you plan it. Maybe we can salvage something.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They hung up, and Agatha turned to Rio, who was pouting.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt lying when I said this is one of the reasons I didn‚Äôt date before. It‚Äôs a lot to ask of someone.‚Äù Agatha said softly, trying to gauge where Rio was at with her feelings.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI understand it‚Äôs your job. I just hate how everything can change so quickly.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI know, baby. It‚Äôs a lot. Let‚Äôs enjoy this weekend, and then come with me or stay with Nicky when you can. Please?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was not used to asking someone these things, but it felt right. She liked knowing that Nicky could stay at the house with Rio and loved having Rio by her side.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI understand if you can‚Äôt come on school nights. Lilia might start saying no to you being out so much,‚Äù Agatha did not want to hear what Lilia had to say about that.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI hope you can make it to the playoff games if the team makes it, though even if we lose the rest of the regular season, we should still make it.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Saturday night faded into Sunday morning and they were up extremely early, despite the time change and jet lag. Rio had wanted to do some sightseeing while in Peru and dragged Agatha out to Machu Picchu. Agatha had been before but enjoyed exploring the ruins with Rio and was glad that Alice had been part of the packing team. Alice knew Rio would want to go and had packed the appropriate gear for the hike.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had to guide Rio away from a tarantula they saw amongst some rocks that Rio had wanted to ‚Äòrehome‚Äô back to LA.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs cute, and I want to name her Victoria,‚Äù Rio said.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI will buy you a tarantula, my love. Wait, what would Raven do?‚Äù Agatha tilted her head, picturing the cat-shaped Eldritch creature training an overgrown furry spider to do her bidding.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúProbably snuggle with it,‚Äù Rio shrugged, waving at the spider and walking back to the main group with Agatha and their security detail.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI was imagining her training it to do things for her,‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAlso a possibility,‚Äù Rio agreed.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     After breakfast on Monday morning, they lay in bed discussing the upcoming busy schedule.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAll of the awards shows are in or around LA, which makes it easy. Talk shows are mainly in LA and New York and mostly over Spring Break. It looks like filming for the show is back in LA, so that makes that easy. Marvel and Disney are between LA and New Jersey, and then this summer, I‚Äôll be in England, Italy, and Australia. It may extend longer. You can come with me over Spring Break if you want to.‚Äù Agatha was trying not to sound desperate to spend every moment with Rio and failing.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a possibility, depending on the schedule. I was hoping we could have some fun this summer, not you working the whole time.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make sense to bring you along either, especially Marvel. It‚Äôs a closed set. If they could cut you off from the entire world until the film was done, they would.‚Äù Agatha spoke seriously.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve heard. I can come to visit, though, right?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure out something. I cannot go for three months without seeing you and Nicky,‚Äù she kissed Rio before turning the discussion to upcoming awards shows.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The concert was amazing, Rio honing into her Spanish-speaking childhood. They sat in a box, which was safer for them, even with security. Rio‚Äôs hips absolutely did not lie as she danced the entire night and sang to Agatha. Rio rolling her R‚Äôs made Agatha feel very indecent things that she planned on capitalizing on when they returned to the hotel.
    </p>
<p>
     Keeping to her word, Agatha had indeed made a few requests for the setlist as several older songs were played, and Shakira mentioned singing them for ‚Äòa friend‚Äô, winking in the direction of their box.
    </p>
<p>
     They flew back early the next day so they could recover on Wednesday before Rio had to go back to teacher mode. They mostly slept on the plane and looked through the pictures they took and a few that popped up online.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still getting used to people posting pictures of me online. It‚Äôs so weird. People will post ‚ÄòRio Vidal sightings‚Äô now.‚Äù Rio mused.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThis is your life now,‚Äù Agatha looked at her. ‚ÄúAs long as you want it.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs breath caught for a millisecond. What did Agatha mean when she said those things? Did she just want to date forever? Get married? Live together? Would she be okay if Rio ended things? Was she waiting for Rio to end things? Agatha was not the most forthcoming when it came to commitment, although Rio was the one they had waited on in that department. She would drop it for now and focus on other things.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They had left Rio‚Äôs car in the lot near the private hangar at the airport. Security escorted them until they sat in the car, Agatha climbing in the passenger seat after opening Rio‚Äôs door when she pointed at something.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRio, what‚Äôs that?‚Äù Agatha pointed at a letter on the dashboard that was addressed to Rio in Lou‚Äôs handwriting.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio froze for a few beats before reaching out and calmly taking the letter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs from Lou,‚Äù She said, her voice cold. ‚ÄúI thought she was still in prison?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed, her head falling against the headrest. ‚ÄúI swear this bitch has nine lives. Her lawyers must have gotten her out on house arrest or something. We will need to tell Nat. Do you want to open it or wait until you‚Äôre alone?‚Äù Agatha wanted Rio to share with her, but it was for Rio, and she wouldn‚Äôt force her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallowed hard as she carefully opened the letter.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMy Dearest Rio,
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The night Agatha confessed to you, she knew I had documents proving the near marriage and her first pregnancy. Did she tell you because she wanted to or because she wanted to beat me to it? Can you trust her to tell you the truth without being forced?
    </p>
<p>
     What else is she still keeping from you? Other than her ex‚Äôs identity?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     You will always be mine,
    </p>
<p>
     I love you. No more secrets.
    </p>
<p>
     Lou."
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio didn‚Äôt know how to feel. She just slouched in her seat and leaned her head back, clutching the letter. She let out an exasperated sigh, not even turning to look at Agatha. ‚ÄúSpeak.‚Äù She commanded in a tired tone.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI had felt guilty for not telling you ever since that initial discussion. When Nat told me Lou had Lorna‚Äôs documents, I knew which ones they were. I knew I had to tell you, and then I discovered the secret about the photo album. I knew after then that it was no longer that I felt forced to tell you, but I wanted to. I wanted, I want, to be honest about everything. I haven‚Äôt told you who Swords is because I don‚Äôt want our sordid past to cloud your judgment of her if your paths cross, just like I said. She‚Äôs a different person now, and I do interact with her occasionally,‚Äù Agatha reached out to take Rio‚Äôs hand, only for Rio to pull away in the small confines of the car.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha winced. ‚ÄúBaby, please. Look at me.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned her head to look at Agatha, hurt in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to say, Agatha? My psychotic ex tells me in a letter that you bared your soul after you found out she knew your dark secrets. You wouldn‚Äôt tell me you loved me until then. I somewhat understand why your ex is still a mystery.‚Äù Rio sighed. She did that too much lately. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go back to the compound.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They drove in silence. It was early evening with the time difference, they noticed Alice‚Äôs car parked outside Agatha‚Äôs house.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDid Alice or Jen mention coming over?‚Äù Rio‚Äôs voice was hoarse from silently crying.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Agatha grabbed for the luggage.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúLeave mine, I‚Äôm going home tonight,‚Äù Rio said softly before walking toward the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a deep breath and put on a smile for her friends as she walked through the door, noticing that Rio had done the same.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHey, what are you two doing here?‚Äù Agatha asked as she took her suitcase straight to the laundry room to deal with later.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWanda told us to meet here. She had us pick up dinner,‚Äù Alice answered, pointing at food containers in the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHere!‚Äù Nicky called as he and the twins walked through the door. ‚ÄúPractice went fine, Rio, I think we have a great shot at state,‚Äù He grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe have to get there first.‚Äù Rio hugged him.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here!‚Äù Wanda shouted as she and Nat came in the door and through to the living room, both glowing. They had laid low since Friday, waiting to gather everyone together.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúGreat, would you like to tell me why everyone is gathered at my house?‚Äù Agatha joked. She had a pretty good idea of what they were about to say.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda and Nat looked at each other, excitement and pure joy radiating from them.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting married!‚Äù The redheads exclaimed at the same time, holding up their left hands.
    </p>
<p>
     There were hugs, congratulations, and cheers. Rio was excited and happy for them. Of course, she was. They had waited for this for so long, and they deserved it. She and Agatha hadn‚Äôt been together long enough to discuss it, so why did she feel hollow?
     <em>
      Because it‚Äôs all vague, and you don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs still holding anything back.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù Alice whispered in her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhat? Yeah! I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúLiar. I know you better than anyone. Something‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù Alice kept her voice low, eyes darting to Agatha. ‚ÄúWhat did she do?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúShe knew Lou had your mom‚Äôs stuff. It‚Äôs why she told me everything. Lou left a letter in my car,‚Äù Rio‚Äôs voice was low as she tried not to look suspicious. ‚ÄúWhat else is she hiding, Alice?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt is Agatha. She plays her cards close to her chest. It‚Äôs how she‚Äôs always had to do things, Ri.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhy are you taking her side?‚Äù Rio was quickly starting to lose trust in everyone.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not. What did she say?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat she didn‚Äôt tell me because she knew psycho had the information, but because she wants to be honest with me.‚Äù Rio echoed what Agatha had said earlier.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThen there‚Äôs your answer. She loves you, Rio. Don‚Äôt do this thing where you get scared and push her away because you overthink it because I know that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù Alice glared. It was a habit Rio had.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI am not.‚Äù Rio looked away, knowing that was what she was doing. ‚ÄúI do think I‚Äôm going to sneak out and recover from the weekend, though.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre as subtle as a heart attack, you idiot.‚Äù Alice muttered, ‚ÄúGo, I‚Äôll cover you.‚Äù Alice made her way back to the main group, gushing over the rings and trying to draw attention away from Rio as she left.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha‚Äôs eyes followed Rio as she left. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on with her?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Alice sighed, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs trying to run because she‚Äôs an insecure idiot who thinks she needs to have a five-year plan three months into a relationship.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSo, a lesbian then?‚Äù Nicky quipped from the table, mouthful of chicken alfredo.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre one to talk. I saw you and Morgan discussing which colleges to go to,‚Äù Tommy shoved his shoulder as Nicky choked on a noodle.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo choking!‚Äù Wanda called, making sure no one was actually choking before looking back at Agatha, ‚ÄúI know the two of you have moved quickly, but have you vocalized what direction you‚Äôre going in? Other than a vague forever?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúForever is vague?‚Äù Agatha quirked an eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat woman is going to break up with you.‚Äù Jen used her fork to gesture at Agatha. ‚ÄúAnd it will be your fault.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo, I thought when you told someone you wanted to be with them for ‚Äòas long as they wanted you‚Äô and ‚Äòforever‚Äô and all that, it meant, well, forever!‚Äù Agatha said, frustrated, and turned to Wanda and Nat. ‚ÄúIt worked for you two!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOnly because I was married,‚Äù Wanda said dryly.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIf Rio didn‚Äôt believe in or want a marriage, that would be one thing. But she does. Have you talked about moving in together? Or a timeline? A timeline for getting married? Anything?‚Äù Alice questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo, why would we? We just started dating.‚Äù Agatha did not understand women.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a collective groan.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAgatha honey,‚Äù Wanda started again, ‚Äúlet me put it this way, do you love Rio?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMadly.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDo you want to live with Rio?‚Äù Wanda continued.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhen do you see that happening?‚Äù Nat jumped in, trying to help draw more out of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWithin a few months, I planned on asking her when her lease came up,‚Äù Agatha answered honestly.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOkay, great! Do you want to marry her?‚Äù Alice took over the next question.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chewed on her bottom lip, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the marrying type,‚Äù She went back to her safe answer.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda waved her hand dismissively. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bullshit protective answer, and we all know it. Try again.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIF I were to get married, it would be her. I do want her to remain in my life romantically.‚Äù Agatha affirmed after thinking about it.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen reached out and put a hand on Jen‚Äôs knee. ‚ÄúThen go tell her that. Come on, we‚Äôll give you a ride, and we have a cheesy idea for how to get her to let you in.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     After they finished eating and Agatha packed food for Rio and Raven, she knew better than to leave out the cat, she was headed back to Rio‚Äôs with Alice and Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure this will work?‚Äù Agatha asked skeptically.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice grinned, ‚ÄúOh, absolutely. If nothing else, Jen will get some great pictures.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI hate you both.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had decided against using her key to get into Rio‚Äôs. She knew Rio was mad at her. She knocked instead, not surprised when she heard Rio tell her to go away.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúPlease, baby? I want to talk.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Rio called back.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio listened for any reply and didn‚Äôt hear one. She turned from the door and stopped when she heard music, followed by the undeniable voice of Agatha Fucking Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI have learned the lesson of all that‚Äôs foul and fair. Our love was forged in fire, water, earth, and air‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn‚Äôt sure if she should laugh or cry. She was getting her very own
     <em>
      Say Anything
     </em>
     moment, except instead of a teenage boy, it was a fifty-one-year-old mega star in the hall of her apartment building.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned around and walked to the door, Agatha still singing.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚Äú...and so I dare, to risk this heart of mine.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened the door to see Agatha holding her phone over her head in the classic John Cusack pose, and Rio couldn‚Äôt help but laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat smile makes this worth it,‚Äù Agatha surged forward, pocketed her phone, kissed Rio heatedly, and closed the door behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt run from me, from us, from this, okay?‚Äù Agatha gasped, peppering Rio‚Äôs face with kisses, hands running through her hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm not the best at this. I do want you. I don‚Äôt know what our future holds, okay? I don‚Äôt know what the five-year plan is. I know I want you to move in with me when your lease is up. I know I want you by my side. I know that we‚Äôve moved really fucking fast, and it terrifies me. I know there are things I still need to tell you.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put her fingers to Agatha‚Äôs lips and looked at her. ‚ÄúAggie, breathe.‚Äù Rio led her to sit down. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to plan all of this out right now. I don‚Äôt want to force you to do anything you‚Äôre not ready for, just, I was led on for so long with a potential psycho killer, and I can‚Äôt do that again.‚Äù Rio looked down, eyes filled with sad and painful memories.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put her hand on Rio‚Äôs cheek and turned Rio‚Äôs face to look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not forcing me. I‚Äôm just bad at communicating without a script. I love you, and the moving-in thing was something I had already planned. I will start telling you about these things when I think of them, okay? I really don‚Äôt know where I am on the marriage thing. If I were to get married, it would be to you. If I were to have more children, it would be with you. If I were to have a dog, or buy another house, or own another business, it would all be with you, Rio. I fucking love you. Please don‚Äôt run or overthink it.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned forward and kissed her tenderly, trying to convey her point. Rio leaned into the kiss, placing her hand on Agatha‚Äôs chest. She pulled back slightly, looking at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat helped. I will try to keep the overthinking to a minimum and stop comparing this to my extremely unhealthy last relationship. Now, what do you still need to tell me? No more secrets. That‚Äôs what got us in this damn mess.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt is, but it‚Äôs late. Can we at least change and get in bed?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWho said you were staying over?‚Äù Rio feined offense.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll just go home.‚Äù Agatha stood.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhatever. You have clothes in my room, and Raven is asleep on your side of the bed.‚Äù Rio stood and walked towards the bedroom, turning off the lights. ‚ÄúYou can put the food you packed for me in the fridge, please!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared after Rio, trying to decide if that was an invitation or a dare. Possibly a threat. She had brought a bag in with food after all, though it seemed like Rio had either eaten or wasn‚Äôt hungry. She turned toward the kitchen and put the food away, going over the day‚Äôs events. She was so incredibly excited for Wanda, and still a little confused over Rio. Where had all of that really come from? Had the letter from Lou caused that? As soon as she thought it, her eyes fell on the letter as she passed back through the living room. The lights were off, but she could tell it was the same letter. She picked it up and used her phone as a flashlight to read over it. Rio had read it in the car, but Agatha hadn‚Äôt seen it. She opened it now to see that there was more writing than what Rio had read.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI have done some thinking. I want to marry you, now.
    </p>
<p>
     You‚Äôre not getting any younger. Let‚Äôs have a baby.
    </p>
<p>
     I‚Äôm 55 and I still want kids.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      That fucking psychotic bitch.
     </em>
     There was even a phone number. She took a screenshot of the letter and sent it to Nat before folding it back up the way she found it and going into the bedroom. Rio was already in bed and waiting for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMade your decision?‚Äù Rio looked at her expectantly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha handed Rio the letter and put her bag on the dresser, looking for her pajamas. ‚ÄúI did bring a bag and all.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     She took out her pajamas and began to change.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhat I need to tell you is that when I decided to marry Swords, I was going to give it all up: my career, the fame, everything. I was only 33 then, so you can imagine what I would have missed. So I really dodged a bullet when she didn‚Äôt show,‚Äù Agatha lifted her hair from her pajama shirt and walked toward the bathroom to brush her teeth while Rio watched her, shocked. ‚ÄúOffering to give it all up was the only way I could get her to agree to marry me, pregnant or not. I think the seriousness of it all scared her. She claimed she couldn‚Äôt let me throw away everything I built,‚Äù Agatha began brushing her teeth while Rio processed it.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI can see why you left that part out since it didn‚Äôt happen, but damn Agatha. That‚Äôs big. I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt get married. I mean, obviously, but also because of everything you wouldn‚Äôt have done. I‚Äôm not even mad at that admission. Oh, early, what businesses do you own?‚Äù Rio had thought about it, but she didn‚Äôt remember Agatha owning a business.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSo, the club in New York? That‚Äôs mine. I own a few other side things here and there.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWait. The secret lesbian club? You own that? Not Andi?‚Äù Rio wasn‚Äôt sure how to feel.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSince I was eighteen. I didn‚Äôt want people to think I was curating my own selection of women or trying to get free drinks. A place like that was needed, so I created it.‚Äù Agatha scooted in next to Rio and kissed her with minty, fresh breath. ‚ÄúMad?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio considered everything before looking over at Agatha. ‚ÄúNo, baby girl, I‚Äôm not.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snorted. ‚ÄúDid you call me baby girl? I am‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cut her off, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care how old you are. You are wearing bunny rabbit pajama bottoms, your hair is in a braid, and you stood at my door reliving a scene from a brat pack movie after chasing after me. You are very much baby girl right now,‚Äù Rio laughed and kissed her on the forehead.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm head over heels in love with you is what I am,‚Äù Agatha grinned before remembering the letter. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me everything that was in that letter?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio made a disgusted sound, ‚ÄúBecause she was trying to get in my head, and I knew you would want to charge off and commit murder.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWell, it worked. She did get in your head, and what‚Äôs wrong with a little murder between mortal enemies?‚Äù Agatha shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre mortal enemies now?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúObviously. She‚Äôs trying to use your insecurity against you and trick you into marrying her and then babytrap you!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, that is what she was doing!‚Äù Rio had been so caught up in her feelings she hadn‚Äôt realized the obvious. ‚ÄúOkay, no, you can end her now.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time I had your blessing.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou already sent Nat that phone number, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, she grinned, straddled Rio, and kissed her.
    </p>

     The rest of February went by with a flurry of awards shows and basketball games. Playoffs began, and SHIELD was the team to beat, and
     <em>
      Death‚Äôs Beloved
     </em>
     was sweeping everything. Yet again, the coven was on top. Plans for the reception after Spring Break were being solidified, the plans for the wedding itself were solidified, and Spring Break plans had been made. Wanda and Nat had announced their engagement by showing up on a red carpet with rings on their hands, and social media had lost it. Wanda confirmed it later with a well-received post.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Now they were at the Oscars. It had already been a wonderful night. Agatha had performed her song and won the Oscar for it. They were waiting for the last two Oscars of the night; Best Actress, and Best Film. They were honestly all hoping for Wanda to win best actress, as Agatha and Wanda held hands while they went through nominees, Agatha turned to Wanda. ‚ÄúYou earned this one angel. If you don‚Äôt win this one, I‚Äôm going to lose my shit,‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThe Oscar goes to‚Ä¶AGATHA HARKNESS!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúFuck that,‚Äù Agatha said, as she hugged and kissed Rio and whispered, ‚ÄúPlease still love me in a few minutes.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     She turned and grabbed Wanda‚Äôs wrist. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go, superstar,‚Äù and pulled her to the stage with her. Agatha wasn‚Äôt at all surprised that their friends were cheering and clapping. Never underestimate Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     They reached the stage, Agatha in a dark purple gown, Wanda in a scarlet one, trying to keep on a smile and not a smirk. Agatha graciously took the golden statue and went to the microphone.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHey everyone, as you can see, I brought the person that actually deserves this award with me.‚Äù Several people cheered, ‚ÄúWell, tell me what you really think. Anyway, this movie would not be as amazing or powerful as it is without this amazing woman standing next to me. The only reason I won and not her is because too many of you took her personal life into account when you voted, and that‚Äôs not fucking right.‚Äù The music began to play, and Agatha looked straight at the sound booth, ‚ÄúCut the music now Ralph, before I call your wife.‚Äù It stopped automatically, and she continued. ‚ÄúAnyway, you‚Äôre voting based on our on-screen performances, not our off-screen performances. Wanda decided to live her truth this year, and you cannot punish her for that by robbing her of a much-deserved award, you cowards. So, Wanda, this is yours.‚Äù She stepped back and handed Wanda the award with a hug.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda stepped to the mic and looked around. ‚ÄúWith as long as I‚Äôve been doing this, I‚Äôm not sure this is allowed‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Agatha Fucking Harkness, she‚Äôs allowed!‚Äù Tony yelled from the audience to several people agreeing.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda looked over to Conan, who was hosting the show, as he just shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOkay, so, thank you to my amazing and wonderful fianc√®e, Nat, my family and friends, Agatha for being‚Ä¶Agatha, everyone who worked on the film, and Agatha, I swear if the Academy strips both of us of this and whatever else, I‚Äôm never having fake sex with you in a movie again.‚Äù Wanda smiled as Agatha smirked, and the crowd laughed. It didn‚Äôt matter where they were. They, they made everyone around them feel like it was a small gathering of friends. Wanda waved as they walked off stage, and Conan sent it to a commercial break before the final award since Wanda and Agatha had to get back to their seats as they were the favorites for the final category.
    </p>
<p>
     One of the members of the board for the Academy came rushing over to them, ‚ÄúMs. Harkness, you can‚Äôt just‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha held her hand up, ‚ÄúWho had the second most votes?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWell, Wanda‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOkay then, I refuse my Oscar. Give it to second place.‚Äù Agatha said resolutely and walked back to her seat, the board member stuttering and stammering behind her, Wanda cackling.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Death‚Äôs Beloved
     </em>
     won Best Picture, the press wanting to speak with Agatha as she ignored them, taking Rio‚Äôs hand.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúCome dance with me at a few after-parties, please, my love?‚Äù She asked.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOf course! I do love a Hollywood rebel.‚Äù
    </p>

     It was the state championship game, and Rio was nervous. SHIELD was hosting as the home team, and the stands were packed. She looked at her players. They were truly
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     team now, even though Coach Carter was in the stands watching and had come and talked with them. Peggy told her she was thinking about staying home with the baby next year and that Rio should take over the team if she did. The possibility was an exciting one, but right now, Rio was focused on the game ahead of them.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAlright, minions, listen up, you guys are amazing, and I love all of you nerds. The girls over there? Yeah, their coach doesn‚Äôt love them, and they aren‚Äôt as cool as you guys are.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     The team laughed and rolled their eyes. Rio always did this at the beginning of a game, saying random things to calm their nerves and make them laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOkay, seriously though, I am so forking proud of all of you. You have done an amazing job this season, and I am so thankful that you guys let me just come in and take over. Now, when we win, no dumping Gatorade on my head. This isn‚Äôt football. We pop champ‚Ä¶sparkling cider bottles over at Morgan‚Äôs house like the ladies we are, got it?‚Äù Several of the girls giggled. The plan was that if they won, there would be a party at the Stark‚Äôs house. Even if they lost, Tony would still host a party. ‚ÄúJust play your best, okay? That‚Äôs all I ask.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     The game started and SHIELD was losing quickly. Rio grimaced. At least they made it this far. She, Nicky, and now Coach Johnson, now that she was back, gave their all from the sidelines. They finally started picking up speed, and by halftime, they were only down by six.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúGreat job, my minions, I‚Äôm so proud of you! Keep it up, draw those fouls, and get some of those girls ejected. Throw elbows if you have to. Play dirty!‚Äù Rio was fired up.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúGo for the knees!‚Äù Agatha said behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMom, wrong sport,‚Äù Nicky reminded her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNot if you make it look accidental,‚Äù Agatha shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo one listen to her,‚Äù Rio instructed as several girls snickered. They were used to Agatha from growing up with Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to look at Agatha with her jersey on and gave her a quick peck on the cheek. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be down here. Go before we get in trouble.‚Äù Rio poked her in the side
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI came to give you a good luck kiss and wish the team luck, good luck youngins!‚Äù She winked and gave Rio a chaste kiss. ‚ÄúBesides, I‚Äôm Agatha Harkness, and I do what I want. You look really sexy in a suit, and I couldn‚Äôt stay away any longer, but the ref keeps giving me side eye, so I‚Äôm going now.‚Äù Agatha sauntered back to her seat with the rest of the coven, and Rio rolled her eyes, turning back to the team with very red cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     Kamala Khan had asked Morgan something that Rio didn‚Äôt hear, only Morgan‚Äôs response of ‚ÄúOh, you can ask Nicky too. They are always like this.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     The game resumed, and SHIELD was back. They tied it up and got ahead quickly, then the other team was ahead, then they were ahead, it was close, and it came down to the last few seconds. Morgan made the shot from the three-point line, a shot she usually wasn‚Äôt good at for her height. Rio watched through her fingers. Agatha watched through her fingers. It went around the rim and through the net just as the buzzer went off. 72-71 SHIELD.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn‚Äôt believe it. If Morgan tried that shot again, she probably wouldn‚Äôt have made it, but right now, she had. Everyone was cheering, running, jumping, and doing the most. Agatha spun her around and threw her arms around her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúEarth to Rio! Your girls won! You did it!‚Äù Agatha exclaimed, buzzing with energy. ‚ÄúI am so proud of you, baby!‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it! We won! We did it! Oh shit! We‚Äôve gotta do the lineup and handshake thing.‚Äù Rio was scrambling and nervous about interacting with the other coach. The other team had matched them the entire time. Rio knew they would.
    </p>
<p>
     It was Rio‚Äôs old team.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs previous assistant coach.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs plays.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blew her whistle and had the girls meet at halfcourt for the customary high fives and good games. Rio saw the questioning looks on the faces of the other girls. None of them knew what had happened, just that one day, Rio was gone.
    </p>
<p>
     Parents were gathered on the court and had stepped aside as the girls went through the line, yet none of them would high-five or shake hands with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was finally face-to-face with the other coach. ‚ÄúMindy, I see you erased the sportsmanship I taught the girls.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou left, and they lost in the first round last year because of it,‚Äù Mindy replied coldly.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI left because I had been stalked and attacked, and therefore was placed on admin leave.‚Äù Rio attempted to explain. ‚ÄúYou would know that if you had been a real friend.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhatever, you knew our plays. Your team cheated.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre MY plays, Mindy. It‚Äôs not cheating when I was the one who wrote the entire playbook.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we ask the official?‚Äù Mindy was right in her face as Nat appeared at Rio‚Äôs side.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúRi, is there a problem?‚Äù Nat asked, sizing up the other woman.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gritted her teeth, ‚ÄúGrab the official, will you Nat? I have a question.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Nat raised an eyebrow but went to get the official. All eyes were on the two coaches at this point, wondering who would throw the first punch. Lilia and Wanda each had Agatha by an arm, holding her back.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAgatha Harkness having her bodyguard keeping an eye on you now? Is she worried someone‚Äôs going to harm her plaything?‚Äù Mindy teased.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWhy are you such a bitch, Mindy? I never did anything to you.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYOU didn‚Äôt, but you had what I wanted, and you threw her away.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wanted to scream. She turned as Nat came back with the official. Mindy opened her mouth, and Rio put up her hand and explained, in a nutshell, the issue.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSo, ma‚Äôam, did we cheat?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     The official shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, we knew you were the former coach. The win is legitimate.‚Äù She looked at Mindy. ‚ÄúYour team needs to vacate now. We will send the second-place trophy to the school.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had wrangled her way out of Wanda and Lilia‚Äôs grip, finally and joined them, glaring at Mindy as she slinked away.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúCan I add her to Nat‚Äôs list?‚Äù Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Rio turned to Agatha, ‚ÄúWe can celebrate now.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The celebrations resumed, and Nicky lifted Morgan so she could cut down the net. When he lowered her back to the ground, she looked up at him questioningly.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not mad or jealous?‚Äù Morgan asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky laughed, ‚ÄúNo, why would I be?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWell, the football team lost in playoffs, and we just won state‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky put his hand up, ‚ÄúWait. You were at the Oscars last Sunday, right?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYes, we sat next to each other.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúJust making sure, and you saw Agatha Harkness give the metaphorical finger to the Academy, refuse her Oscar, and give it to my Aunt because she deserves it more, right?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Morgan wasn‚Äôt following, ‚ÄúOf course I did, Nicky, but what does that have to do‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting there, but you know that‚Äôs my mom and my aunt, and they raised me, right?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNicky, yes, but‚Ä¶oh.‚Äù It hit her. Nicky didn‚Äôt have a jealous bone in his body. If someone worked hard for something and deserved it, they deserved it, and he would support them.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNicholas Harkness, you are the most well-rounded and well-adjusted 16-year-old boy to exist. I love you.‚Äù She stood on her tiptoes and kissed him.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMy mom had me do a lot of therapy early on to make sure I‚Äôd be like this.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a smart woman. Now stop kissing my daughter,‚Äù Tony said, walking up to them as Pepper rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúWe have a party at the house to get to.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Tommy jogged up to Cassie, ‚ÄúHey, are you going to the party? I know you didn‚Äôt play or even dress out, but uh, good job?‚Äù He offered as she laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such an idiot, Tommy. Yes, I‚Äôm going, are you.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI mean, if you are‚Ä¶‚Äù Tommy ran a hand through his hair.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen groaned. ‚ÄúThis kid is painful,‚Äù She said to Wanda, who nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda looked at them, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll give you a ride, Cassie, come on.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio watched as everyone dispersed, most people headed towards Tony‚Äôs. She looked at Agatha, ‚ÄúI should make an appearance, huh?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou did coach them to victory,‚Äù Agatha offered.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOkay, fine, but just a few minutes, then take me home.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
     It was finally time, Vegas weekend. Wedding weekend.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice wore an ecru tux with an orange vest and heels. Her black and red hair was in big, loose curls. They were getting married in a chapel her mother had frequented. It was cliche and a bit cheesy, but very ‚ÄòWu‚Äô.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre beautiful,‚Äù Rio gushed, eyes full of tears.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry, you‚Äôll ruin your makeup,‚Äù Alice scolded, knowing that if Rio cried, she would too.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was wearing a simple orange spaghetti-strap dress with heels and had a bouquet of pink roses. ‚ÄúNo promises once the ceremony starts, okay? I just wish‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI know. I wish they were here too.‚Äù Alice finished. She knew Rio was thinking of Lorna and Gran but was trying to spare them tears.
    </p>
<p>
     They turned when they heard Wanda come into the small room.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre both beautiful.‚Äù Wanda fanned her eyes so she wouldn‚Äôt cry. ‚ÄúAlice, let‚Äôs get you married.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice stood at the altar. Vision was officiating; they were just using the chapel. Nat, Wanda, and the boys sat in chairs in the audience.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha waited just outside of the chapel with Jen. Agatha wore a black suit with a pink bowtie and matching vest. Her chestnut hair was down in long waves, a pink rose in her chest pocket, and pink stilettos completing the outfit.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen wore a strapless, tea-length ivory dress that flared out at the waist with a petticoat underneath. It had a pink sash around the middle, and she wore a pink knitted bolero, pink heels, and carried pink roses that matched Rio‚Äôs. Her hair had grown out since the fall, and she wore her natural curls close to her scalp with a simple strand of pearls.
    </p>
<p>
     She wore Gran‚Äôs engagement ring, a white gold band with three pink gemstones in the middle.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha‚Äôs heart stopped when Rio approached. She was beautiful. The orange perfectly complimented her skin, and Agatha couldn‚Äôt help but picture what Rio would wear to Wanda‚Äôs wedding or potentially their own one day.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWow,‚Äù Was all Agatha could say as she kissed Rio, careful not to smudge her makeup.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWow, yourself,‚Äù Rio parroted before turning to Jen. ‚ÄúYou look absolutely radiant. I am so happy for you. But if you hurt her, whatever Nat is capable of will seem like child‚Äôs play.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Jen gulped, taking Rio seriously, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm afraid or if I want your number‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha narrowed her eyes at Jen as she heard the music start from inside.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our cue. My love?‚Äù She held out her arm for Rio as they went inside and headed down the aisle to their places.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen followed, and Alice‚Äôs lips parted in a delighted sigh. Jen did the same when she saw Alice. Rio thought they looked perfect for each other because they were perfect for each other.
    </p>
<p>
     The ceremony began, and the time to exchange vows came. They had each prepared their own, and Alice shifted nervously as she started.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to try and get through this without crying, and I usually don‚Äôt cry,‚Äù she laughed shakily, seeing only Jen in front of her. ‚ÄúJennifer, you were one of my first friends in LA when Agatha and Wanda pulled me in, and you saw me for more than Lorna Wu‚Äôs daughter and Agatha‚Äôs goddaughter.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been listening intently and was shocked at that small revelation as she caught Agatha‚Äôs eye and exchanged glances with her. They would discuss that small tidbit later, but that explained why she talked to Alice at Lorna‚Äôs funeral. Rio had kept listening while in her own thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWe quickly became friends and walked that very thin line for far too long. The classic tale of falling in love with one of your best friends and not wanting to lose that. When we finally went on that first date last fall, it was like someone threw gas on a smoldering fire. We couldn‚Äôt go fast enough, though
     <em>
      some people
     </em>
     will say we took too long, myself being one of them. We‚Äôre finally here, and that‚Äôs what matters. While part of me feels like we‚Äôre making up for lost time, I know we spent most of that time together in some capacity. We fell in love over a decade ago, and it took us that long to figure it out. Hanging out at the compound, parties, texting during awards shows, so many little things brought us here to this moment, and I am grateful for them all.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Alice swiped a tear away from her cheek as Rio handed her Kleenex, and Agatha did the same for Jen. Alice took Jen‚Äôs hand in hers and continued.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI vow to love you fiercely, to always ask your expertise when creating lesson plans, to be your hiking partner, and to listen to you rant about certain people in this room.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     They both grinned and looked at Agatha after the last one, who just shrugged before turning back to the moment at hand.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúMost importantly, I vow to be your rock, the person you come home to, the one you can lean on for the rest of our lives and whatever comes after that.‚Äù Alice wiped a tear from Jen‚Äôs cheek with her thumb.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHow am I supposed to follow that?‚Äù Jen took a breath, steadying herself. ‚ÄúAlice. You came into my life at a personal turning point in so many ways. I was proving myself in my career and my identity. I was thirty and having a crisis. The first major interaction we had, I was ranting about a major scandal I was having to fix because of your fairy gaymother back there, and you made me dinner, helped me work through it, and then picked my brain for historical accuracy for something. You‚Äôve always been able to calm my inner rage in a way no one else has. I was so afraid of losing that that I denied my feelings for so long. When you called hours after I told you I just wanted to be friends, I was so thankful that you saw through it, like you always do. It does seem like we ran with things when, in reality, it was painfully slow. I can‚Äôt imagine doing life without you. I vow to drive you insane with my skincare routine, to love you intensely, to always be by your side, and to never intentionally cause you pain.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rings were exchanged, a pronouncement was made, and Alice and Jen were officially married. There was not a dry eye in the place.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They had a small dinner afterward to celebrate before everyone went their separate ways and began their Spring Break plans. The newlyweds were off to somewhere tropical for a few days before being back in LA for the reception. Vision and the twins were going to hike in the Grand Canyon for a few days. Nat and Wanda had plans to hustle a few poker tables for sport, and Billy went back to his room to talk to Morgan. He was going skiing with the Starks for a few days, and they were making plans for the trip. The boy was exactly like his mother when it came to love.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio and Agatha sat in a private VIP area at The Wynn, overlooking the activity and watching two redheads win hand after hand.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúWanda Maximoff, gambler and bookie. Who knew?‚Äù Rio observed as Agatha sipped champagne. ‚ÄúSpeaking of surprising things, godmother?‚Äù Rio turned to look at the woman next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAlice didn‚Äôt want to make a big deal of it, and it was her secret to tell, not mine,‚Äù Agatha waved it off.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fair. Is that what you told her at Lorna‚Äôs funeral?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúPart of it, again, this is a discussion you need to have with Alice. What I can tell you is that when Lorna had Alice, she asked me to be the godmother more as a formality. However, she did want Alice to have a choice between Norma and myself. So when Lorna died, I gave her that envelope with Lorna‚Äôs journal and documents. I knew some of what was in there, not what‚Äôs written in the journal, other than it‚Äôs for Alice if she ever reads it.‚Äù Agatha turned to Rio. ‚ÄúFor everything else, you really do need to talk to Alice.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio accepted that. She knew Lorna and Agatha had been close and that there were things about that particular history that she would never know.

     ‚ÄúWill do. Now, we have a busy week ahead of us and an early flight to New York tomorrow. I say we leave the red-headed demons to their hustle and, um, turn in for the night, my love.‚Äù Rio placed her empty champagne flute on a nearby table and took Agatha‚Äôs hand, leading her to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúOh? Tired already?‚Äù Agatha placed her glass down and followed Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù
    </p>

     Spring Break felt like a movie montage. The first few days were spent in New York, and the second half was spent in LA, leading up to Alice and Jen‚Äôs reception. Wanda and Nat had come with them so Nat could do bodyguard duty, and Wanda was on some of the press as well, with the awards' success. Rio loved watching Agatha do interviews and talk about her projects; how animated she was speaking about her work, facial expressions, and reactions. Agatha was so dedicated to what she did, and it showed in interviews. Everyone she spoke with would ask Agatha about Rio and Nicky, and she would gush about Nicky and try to be close-lipped about Rio but blush and say things were good and she was happy.
    </p>
<p>
     They went to Buzzfeed, where Wanda and Agatha both filmed a segment for ‚ÄòThirst Tweets,‚Äô which was full of laughter and was highly inappropriate. Rio and Nat were both mentioned in several of them and could be heard from behind the camera.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They flew back to LA for more press as everyone else started to return and prepare for the reception on Saturday. Lou‚Äôs trial was also that week, and everyone watched it closely. They expected her to plead insanity and get it. The sentencing is what they were the most concerned with, and how to keep her wherever she was sent to. That was the hard part.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat in front of the TV at Agatha‚Äôs, waiting for the final word when everyone else came back from whatever show they had been filming for.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAny word yet?‚Äù Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just shook her head, eyes glued to the TV as Jen‚Äôs phone rang and the special report cut off.
    </p>
<p>
     All eyes turned to Jen as she hung up the phone.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúBefore sentencing occurs, Lou is requesting to speak to you privately at the courthouse. She says she has information you‚Äôll want, and some things that belong to you, specifically those videos. Lawyers will meet us there.‚Äù Jen turned on her heel and walked back out.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio sat in the judge‚Äôs chambers across a table from Lou. Everyone else was outside and pissed about it‚Äîno recording devices, just the two of them, as Rio glared at her.
    </p>
<p>
     Lou inhaled sharply, ‚ÄúWhere do you want me to go, Rio?‚Äù She asked sincerely.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her cautiously. ‚ÄúWhat are you playing at?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Lou let out a shrill laugh. ‚ÄúI want you more than anything, and I love you more than anything. Yet here I am. The past finally caught up to me. Oh, we‚Äôre not over, not in the least. I‚Äôll get out, and I‚Äôll get you back. I still have eyes and ears on you and Agatha. However, it‚Äôs not looking great at this moment. Lawyers say if I can get a good character witness, I might not be sent to the Island.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     A sarcastic smile slid across Rio‚Äôs face before she started laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúAre you fucking kidding me? You‚Äôre asking me to put in a good word for you? You‚Äôre unbelievable! No one gets out of The Island. It‚Äôs the most secure psych institution in the world; people disappear from there, never to be seen again, Lou, and I sincerely hope you‚Äôre one of them. How the fuck do you still have eyes and ears on us?‚Äù That tidbit just hit Rio as she backtracked.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúYou are obsessed with knowing what your precious cat is doing all the fucking time,‚Äù Lou let out an exasperated sigh. ‚ÄúI just laid it all out for you, and you‚Äôre still going to let them put me away, possibly never to see me again?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúI hate you, and I don‚Äôt hate anyone! You made me despise you! You made me genuinely afraid for my life! You tried to hurt my son, Lou! I can‚Äôt trust you. You want to know where I want you? In a fucking grave! It‚Äôs the only way to know I and everyone I love is safe! Alice and Jen got married, and I was nervous you would find a way to ruin their day! You tried to win me back with empty promises of a baby, that‚Äôs a whole new level of fucked up, even for you! No, I will not be a character witness. Wait, is that the information you had? How you were still listening in? Through the pet cameras?‚Äù Rio was livid.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúIt got you down here, didn‚Äôt it?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Rio slammed her hands on the table, causing Lou to jump. ‚ÄúWhere are these belongings? Videos? Whatever the fuck else you have?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúHouse, in the safe. You need me‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre predictable, and I know all your codes.‚Äù Rio stood and walked toward the door. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see your face again, Lou Falco. I feel so bad for Shane‚Äôs kids and pray they have a wonderful therapist. I hope you rot and are never heard from again. I was in love with you once, but I‚Äôm not now. When I do get married and potentially have a baby, it will be with Agatha.‚Äù With that, Rio left the room, Lou screaming behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Nat as she walked past her, ‚ÄúI assume you got all that somehow, and we‚Äôre disabling Raven‚Äôs cameras and sending a team to Lou‚Äôs?‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
     Nat nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù Rio took Agatha‚Äôs hand as they walked out a side door where they had come in unseen. ‚ÄúI have a feeling she‚Äôll disappear in a few days and won‚Äôt be heard from again.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice and Jen couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more beautiful reception. Their friends had outdone themselves, and everything was going amazingly well. They had repeated their vows for everyone and were mingling, staying together, and accepting congratulations from co-workers, friends, and acquaintances.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched as everyone enjoyed themselves. The past few days had happened in a whirlwind, and she had to work in less than forty-eight hours. She watched as Wanda and Nat whispered to each other, discussing their future wedding most likely. The boys and their dates were dancing and laughing, and Agatha was talking animatedly with the Starks, among others, when she looked back at Rio and winked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio‚Äôs mind wandered, taking in the expanse of celebrities and people now a part of her daily life. Everyone seemed to be here. Suddenly, she couldn‚Äôt help but think about how Agatha had mentioned that Swords was still in her life. Was Swords here? At Alice‚Äôs reception? It bothered Rio that Swords might be someone who would be at big events like this, and she didn‚Äôt know it. She looked around, surveying the room for older Hollywood women.¬† That‚Äôs when Rio heard a familiar voice.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚Äú...you know, I helped Cher write Believe.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      No.
     </em>
     The world stopped in the worst of ways, everything happening in slow motion. The voice floated to Rio‚Äôs ears again.
    </p>
<p>
     ‚ÄúC‚Äômon kid, the song isn‚Äôt THAT old.‚Äù
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Is that where Agatha got the ‚Äòkid‚Äô habit from?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Swords wasn‚Äôt a Hollywood powerhouse. No, she was the mysterious figure in the shadows, a keeper of secrets. Not famous, but infamous.
    </p>
<p>
     Puzzle pieces started to fall in place. The older woman, the caring mentor.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned her head, eyes landing on the owner of the voice, knowing full well the owner‚Äôs identity but not wanting to admit it to herself as the full weight of it hit her like a punch to the chest, shattering her heart, and sucking all the air from the room.
    </p>
<p>
     The Calderu knows best attitude, arrogance, and entitlement.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia was Agatha‚Äôs ex.

       1987 Los Angeles
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúMom! Why can‚Äôt I just go to school normally like other kids? Instead of being tutored and doing everything from a distance? There‚Äôs that school for kids of celebrities and the rich that‚Äôs right here. I could socialize and be out of your hair.‚Äù Fourteen-year-old Agatha Harkness asked her mother. She spent all of her time either under Evanora‚Äôs very controlling thumb or on a set. She had her ways of rebelling and doing what she wanted, but more freedom was something she craved. She had gone through tutors and homeschool programs, and if her mother would let her, she could test out of high school and probably a few degree programs. She could speak multiple languages, code those new computers, and run all the movie equipment‚Ä¶what else was a bored child star supposed to do with her spare time? She broke laws, learned, and had a lot of mature fun with her costars.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Her mother wanted her to waste her talents on bible studies and high school work.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou have been learning things above your station, Agatha. You will also spend more time in your religious studies. I only allow you to continue this devil‚Äôs work because it is good money for your future.‚Äù Evanora replied in her normal, harsh voice.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúHa. You mean for you.‚Äù Agatha responded and received a slap across the face. It was a wonder she didn‚Äôt have a constant bruise on her left cheek.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou will not smart back to me!‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It was then that there was a knock on the door. Evanora looked at Agatha severely. Agatha couldn‚Äôt remember a time when there was love in her mother‚Äôs eyes.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúThat school you so desperately wanted to attend sends teachers for distance students. No need to physically go to the school. Ms. Calderu will be your teacher for the rest of your high school years. You will be respectful. Now, I have errands to run.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Evanora opened the door of the trailer, welcomed Ms. Calderu in, and introduced her to Agatha before leaving. Agatha knew her mother was going to some church function.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúGood afternoon, Miss Harkness,‚Äù Lilia greeted her, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Ms. Calderu, and I‚Äôll be your teacher for the remainder of your high school experience. I understand that you‚Äôre actually quite advanced,‚Äù The teacher smiled warmly at her, setting books down on the table and sitting.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha looked Lilia up and down. The older woman had long brown hair that she wore up, hazel eyes, and an Italian-New Yorker accent. Agatha propped her chin in one hand. This was going to be fun.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your first name?‚Äù Agatha asked innocently.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why that‚Äôs relevant,‚Äù Lilia replied, sorting through a stack of papers.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou know mine, and if I‚Äôm going to be stuck with you for the next several years, it‚Äôs only fair I know it,‚Äù Agatha reasoned.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been warned about you, Miss Harkness. Your tactics won‚Äôt work, and you won‚Äôt scare me.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had indeed heard how Agatha had either outsmarted, outwit, psychologically tortured, or plain seduced any previous person who tried to teach her. Purely for fun. SHIELD was the elder Harkness‚Äôs last option. Agatha wasn‚Äôt a bad kid. She was just trying to spite her mother.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúOh? Did Evanora warn you? Tell you I was born evil and should have been killed at birth?‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha‚Äôs face hardened. She no longer looked fourteen, but much older. Lilia wanted to soften but had been warned about this, too.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúNo, a mutual friend of ours, and I‚Äôve been told you like a mystery. So, for every lesson we complete, I‚Äôll either answer a question of yours or let you guess who our mutual friend is, agreed?‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had always been good with these Hollywood kids. She had grown up adjacent to Broadway and moved out to LA when her best friend had. The child stars had to be given some semblance of control as they had so little of it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha looked at her cautiously, ‚ÄúFor each assignment I complete, not a lesson, an assignment could be a worksheet, that could be four or five a session,‚Äù She countered, her blue eyes sparkling.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia scoffed. ‚ÄúEvery two,‚Äù she counteroffered.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù Agatha agreed.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       That day, Agatha learned that Ms. Calderu was 28, her first name was Lilia, she was originally from New York, and her favorite color was yellow.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       When Lilia returned to the house she shared with her friend, she sat her bag down and sighed.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. She‚Äôs a smart kid but is trouble with a capital T and is shadier than a forest. Her mother is also a complete loon and abusive.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Hollywood superstar Lorna Wu nodded.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI hope to get her out of there one day, sooner rather than later. She has a bright future ahead of her if we remove the crazy factor. That‚Äôs where you come in.‚Äù

       ‚ÄúAfter being outed as a lesbian, and her mother attempting to murder her, Agatha Harkness, the sixteen-year-old award-winning actress, has won her legal battle against her mother and is now legally independent from her‚Ä¶‚Äù
      </em>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha cut off the TV that showed a picture of her with a stoic expression on the steps of the Los Angeles courthouse, watching as her mother was escorted away. Evanora had been hurling bible verses at her as they led her away. Lawyers surrounded Agatha, the face of America‚Äôs brave lesbian sweetheart. Sixteen and on her own.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She sat in
      </span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
       her
      </span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
       house. She planned on selling it and buying a condo, with Lorna and Lilia in the condo on either side, watching her carefully. She had guessed that Lorna was the ‚Äòmutual friend‚Äô three months into Lilia being her teacher.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sixteen,‚Äù She said softly, lip quivering. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sixteen and will be seventeen in a few months. My closest friends are a twenty-nine-year-old movie star who made me the godmother of her child and my thirty-year-old teacher. I am technically a self-inflicted orphan, the face of the queer community, a child star still on the rise, I have a growing reputation for being a bit of a party girl, and people want to be me,‚Äù A tear fell down her cheek as she looked at both of them. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be me right now.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia pushed a piece of hair behind her ear. ‚ÄúI know Aggie. We‚Äôre both here for you. You have a staff of people, and you are the strongest person we know. You can go to school now if you want. You can stop acting, whatever you want.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúNo, I love acting and telling stories. My filming schedule isn‚Äôt conducive to going to school, and I‚Äôm almost done. I do want to get my college degree, though. I just, it‚Äôs a lot. Thank you both for everything you‚Äôve done to get me out of there. Lorna, you‚Äôll be a great mom. I really think if you moved Gran and Alice out here‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha trailed off. She knew it was no use. Lorna was more of a mom to Agatha than Evanora had been, but Lorna was insistent on Alice having a ‚Äònormal‚Äô life.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna pulled out a small box and handed it to Agatha.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWe got you something to commemorate today, and our little coven, so to speak,‚Äù Lorna looked to Lilia as Agatha opened the box.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha took in the gold, purple, and ivory locket with the three women on it, looking at the women on either side of her, eyebrows raised in question.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia reached over, pointing to each silhouette as she spoke. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the triple goddess, maiden, mother, crone.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna nodded, adding. ‚ÄúThe three of us. Lilia‚Äôs the crone,‚Äù She grinned. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a reminder that while you‚Äôve freed yourself from Evanora, you‚Äôre never alone. We‚Äôre in this together, sweetie.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha lightly ran her fingers over the three silhouettes, an idea pushing it‚Äôs way to the front of her brain. ‚ÄúWait one minute!‚Äù She got up, her bare feet running to the bathroom and she returned with three small rubberbands and scissors, one of the very few times her age actually shone through her more mature facade.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúCut off a small lock of hair and hand it to me.‚Äù The older women did as commanded, and Agatha took the auburn, chestnut, and jet black locks of hair and secured them in the locket.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúThere,‚Äù she said, voice wavering with the weight of her emotions, ‚Äúthe three of us, together, forever.‚Äù

<span>
       It was Agatha‚Äôs eighteenth birthday. Although she had been an adult for longer, she was now legally an adult. That day, she bought a large piece of land that she eventually wanted to build on. For now, she would need to work on getting permits, clearing the land, and extending utilities to it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha was not like any other eighteen-year-old in the world.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She also was finally going to act on recently developed feelings.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lately, she had begun to see Lilia in a different light.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had always been one of her two mentors. She had come into her life with a mission to free her from Evanora‚Äôs clutches, had been there for her during very dark times, and was one of her closest friends.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha absolutely loved Lilia, just as she loved Lorna. Her best friends happened to be in their thirties, and Agatha happened to be more emotionally mature than her eighteen years on this earth. She wasn‚Äôt in love with Lilia, no, but she was attracted to her. She always had been to a degree, but now, it was boiling at the edge, and she needed to act on it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       For her birthday, they had rented out a club in downtown LA. She had been drinking. No one cared how old you were when you were as famous as she was. She had finally mustered up the courage, and ‚ÄúRescue Me‚Äù by Madonna was playing when Agatha found Lilia standing on her own.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Perfect.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúHappy Birthday, Gorgeous!‚Äù Lilia smiled as Agatha approached.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha was fueled by vodka and couldn‚Äôt stop. She went all in, hooked her fingers through the belt loops of Lilia‚Äôs jeans, and kissed Lilia like it was the last thing she was going to do.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       The best part was when Lilia kissed her back.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha relaxed into the kiss when Lilia forcefully shoved her back, eyes wide, lips swollen.

       ‚ÄúAgatha, I‚Ä¶‚Äù She was stepping away from Agatha in shock. ‚ÄúI hate Madonna,‚Äù she blurted before she darted away. Agatha went to go after her when she felt a hand close around her bicep. She turned to see Lorna, eyes full of worry, as she pulled her to a quieter area.
      </span>

</p>
<p>

<span>
       ‚ÄúWhat were you thinking, Agatha?‚Äù she asked. She wasn‚Äôt mad, just confused.

<p>

<span>
       ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôve always been attracted to her,‚Äù Agatha replied. She was leaning against a wall, still fuzzy from the alcohol, arms crossed, eyes trained on the toes of her shoes.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYes, but that doesn‚Äôt mean kiss her the day you‚Äôre no longer jailbait, sweetie,‚Äù Lorna put a comforting hand on her shoulder. ‚ÄúDo you really want to turn one of your best friends into another conquest? You just turned eighteen, and everyone knows what you‚Äôve been up to since you were thirteen. Now, you can broadcast it. Do you want Lilia to be another on a growing list?‚Äù

       Lorna wasn‚Äôt judging. At thirty-one, she had a long list herself and several divorces to her name. There was no shame here. Agatha let out a sound of agreement.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha had just returned from several months of filming overseas, and Lorna was still abroad. Things had gone back to normal in the past two years, though Agatha still had feelings for Lilia.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia wasn‚Äôt sure how she felt about Agatha, but she knew she didn‚Äôt feel right dating her, and she was not going to be another notch in her metaphorical bedpost. She was, however, going to take her out to celebrate her return. Agatha had matured more and looked far less like the fourteen-year-old girl she first met six years ago and more like the woman she was destined to be. Lilia was proud of her. She was racking up awards and rising in fame and popularity. She hadn‚Äôt gone the way of some childhood stars, and she was using her fame for good.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia loved and cherished her career. However, she also loved the position it put her in and the proximity to power. You could take the Italian out of New York‚Ä¶
      </span>

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She dealt in secrets and information, her ability to read people gave her the upper hand on these power players, and she could negotiate a Hollywood contract with the best of them. Lilia was behind some major dealings in Hollywood, and no one would ever know. She had recently purchased an old Victorian mansion and was having it renovated. ‚ÄòOh, an uncle back east passed.‚Äô she had said. More like, ‚ÄòHoward Stark closed a major deal with my help. ‚Äô
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Some of this knowledge she would pass to Agatha. How to be discreet in your affairs, curate the you that you wanted the public to see. Agatha was going to be a star like no other. She knew it, and so did Lorna. Or at least, that was their hope.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha had told Lilia all about filming and stories about her co-stars. She had been nervous throughout dinner and then afterward at the bar they had gone to. She‚Äôd even turned down every woman who approached her, which was very unlike her. Lilia had an idea of what was happening, and she had to stop it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúLilia, I‚Äôve been thinking about what happened when I turned eighteen‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha looked at her nervously.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúAgatha, you can‚Äôt even legally drink yet,‚Äù Lilia knew what she was about to say.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI‚Äôm drinking right now. In public.‚Äù

</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúLilia, I‚Äôm legally an adult. I own property, in fact, several homes. Hell, I run a successful club in New York, have an EGOT, and more awards than some actors three times my age.‚Äù Agatha listed off qualifications as if she were in an interview.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúAgatha, you know I don‚Äôt care about any of that. I‚Äôm not going to be another name on your list.‚Äù Lilia didn‚Äôt expect Agatha to be offended.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúLilia, that‚Äôs not what I want. I respect you too much to just make you another nameless woman in a pile of bodies. I want to date you.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia was shocked. ‚ÄúAgatha, we cannot date. People would talk,‚Äù she lowered her voice. ‚ÄúPeople would think I had had a relationship with you when I taught you. I could lose my career.‚Äù Lilia had invested too much to get where she was.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt though, that‚Äôs disgusting. I thought you were pretty, but no.‚Äù Agatha wrinkled her nose.

<em>

       April 1996 New York City
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It was the opening night of Rent, and Agatha was playing Maureen. She had just put on an amazing performance and was hoping this would be her second Tony. She met Lorna and Lilia backstage, both of them glowing.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúOh, sweetie, you did such a great job! I am so proud of you! Your second Broadway show, and it‚Äôs going to be such a success!‚Äù Lorna gushed like the proud surrogate mother she was. Alice was seven, yet here Lorna was, a bigger part of Agatha‚Äôs life than Alice‚Äôs. Agatha would always carry that guilt with her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúDo you really think so?‚Äù Agatha asked, seeking the approval she so desperately desired.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúOf course, you‚Äôre the perfect person to play Maureen. No one can cage you.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia added, pulling Agatha in for a hug. They both smelled like the lavender incense that engulfed Agatha‚Äôs Brooklyn apartment. Agatha‚Äôs feelings for Lilia had only increased, and she knew that once she added alcohol to the mix, she would be making moves tonight.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       They were celebrating opening night and were out with the cast, crew, friends, and family. Lorna had already left with her current flavor of the moment, and Agatha and Lilia had stolen off to a corner and were considering leaving themselves. Agatha had shows the next day and had been drinking.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the kid?‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha asked, referencing the sixteen-year-old Sokovian refugee, Wanda Maximoff. She had recently been taken in by her aunt, a producer, in LA after losing her parents and twin brother after the war had basically wiped her small country off the map. She was a sweet kid and was cast alongside Agatha in a TV show, ‚ÄòSisters‚Äô. Agatha was doing Rent for a few months while they were off and then would return to LA. Agatha didn‚Äôt trust Wanda‚Äôs aunt and was keeping a close eye on her. Agatha fully planned on being the Lorna in her life at Lilia‚Äôs insistence if needed. She would have done it anyway. She knew what it was like to be in an abusive environment.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWanda‚Äôs aunt is getting worse, but we have eyes on the kid. She‚Äôs asked about you. Give her a call or an email sometime, will you? Wanda misses you. You‚Äôre like an older sister to her. She really doesn‚Äôt have anyone, and we‚Äôre ancient in her eyes. She‚Äôs not as mature as you were at that age.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had concern in her eyes and was acting as a teacher to Wanda just as she had to Agatha nearly a decade ago.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad she has both of you, like I did. How‚Äôs Lorna doing?‚Äù Agatha asked as they started to head toward the exit.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia just made an exasperated sound. Lorna‚Äôs ‚Äòdemons,‚Äô as they called it, were increasing. Agatha‚Äôs own drinking was increasing, so she couldn‚Äôt say much. Lilia was the only one who had any control of anything and had to for her career.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI‚Äôm keeping an eye on her. I wish she would move Norma and Alice to LA. Enroll Alice at SHIELD. Norma would keep her healthy, at least. She‚Äôd get you into shape, too. Every time you visit them, she lays into you.‚Äù Lilia gave Agatha a knowing look.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI know. I know she wants Alice to experience some type of normalcy. She can still be involved, though.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha ended that line of conversation there, switching back to the musical as they talked until they arrived at the apartment in Brooklyn. She had dreams of renovating an entire floor of a building one day, maybe in Manhattan. For now, she liked this one.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha always had an air of confidence bordering on cockiness, and it was partly how she got to where she was. The older she got, the more it grew, and the bolder and more arrogant she became. Her increasing alcohol usage did not help, and her increased tolerance hid her lack of sobriety well.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       They settled for the night, and it was now or, well, next time. Agatha looked at Lilia, who was telling her a very animated story about school. NDAs be damned, Lilia told Agatha anyway and just spoke in initials. They were sitting close together on the loveseat, twisted towards each other. Agatha kept subtly moving closer, something that naturally happened between them until she was leaning against Lilia. Agatha turned her head, their faces inches apart. Their eyes locked.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       This time, it was mutual.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It was passionate.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It was forbidden.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia was, once again, the one to pull back.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúAgatha, we can‚Äôt.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Instead of panicked, she looked sad.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWe can, and I‚Äôve thought about it. Just listen,‚Äù Agatha had both hands on Lilia‚Äôs forearm. Lilia had one arm on the back of the couch and a hand on Agatha‚Äôs thigh. ‚ÄúYou have to go back to LA, and I‚Äôm staying here. We both excel at casual. That‚Äôs what we do.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia wasn‚Äôt so sure.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúAgatha, you‚Äôve wanted to date for years. I don‚Äôt think you can do casual, and I don‚Äôt do monogamous. You‚Äôve known me for almost ten years, and you know my history. Lorna is a serial monogamist. I date many people, and you‚Äôre, well you‚Ä¶‚Äù Lilia trailed off.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI have a very high libido,‚Äù Agatha finished for her. ‚ÄúI can do this, Lilia. Just don‚Äôt fall in love with me. I‚Äôm very irresistible.‚Äù

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia expected this reaction as they stood in Lilia‚Äôs kitchen. Lilia was trying to get her to eat something after a few days of Lorna obviously not eating anything.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúThat she‚Äôs a very attractive woman and can make her own decisions,‚Äù Lilia responded, directing Lorna to the table.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúNo, Lilia. You cannot do this. We practically raised her. This is not okay.‚Äù Lorna sat, accepting the bowl of pasta from her friend.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYOU practically raised her. I‚Äôm more of an older friend and gay auntie. Okay, yeah, that makes it weird.‚Äù

<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou have taught her how to lie, cheat, curate her image, and now what, hone her skills in other areas? No, do NOT tell me about that.‚Äù Lorna added as Lilia began to speak. ‚ÄúShe is going to fall in love with you, Lilia. She‚Äôs been halfway there for years as it is.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúShe said it would be casual,‚Äù Lilia repeated. She had repeated it to herself over the past few days, trying to make herself feel better about what had happened.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou believe that? Agatha is manipulative. You know that! You, of all people, should be impervious to her tactics, but you let your desires get in your way. I get that she is young, smart, and beautiful. She even makes me question myself. Alas, tragically straight. But Lilia, she‚Äôs not one of your Hollywood side items. She‚Äôs our Aggie.‚Äù Lorna finally took a bite of pasta, trying to let her words sink in.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWhat if I want to continue this? What if I like being with her, Lorna?‚Äù Lilia asked, slumping into a chair with pasta of her own.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúDo you want commitment? Do you want to be public?‚Äù Lorna asked between bites, being careful not to eat too fast.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúNo. I can‚Äôt risk my job like that, teaching or behind the scenes,‚Äù Lilia sighed. ‚ÄúI also want her to have someone there for her. Her drinking is getting out of hand and‚Ä¶‚Äù She looked away from Lorna, not able to see it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúAnd I started out as a functional alcoholic, and you don‚Äôt want her to spiral like I am?‚Äù Lorna raised an eyebrow.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia worried at her bottom lip. She couldn‚Äôt voice what she was actually thinking. Yes, Lorna had things mostly under control for now, but that was the real reason she didn‚Äôt want Alice and Norma to move to LA. Lilia knew Norma would be tougher on Lorna than Lilia and Agatha were. Norma would light into Agatha, too. It‚Äôs what both of them needed, really.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou know I just want what‚Äôs best, and I worry. I want you to live to see Alice get married, have kids if she wants, and excel in whatever career she chooses,‚Äù Lilia gestured with her hands.
      </span>

</p>
<p>
<em>

       Lorna smiled. She spoke with her mom every day about Alice. ‚ÄúShe plays school with her dolls every day. She‚Äôs going to teach, like you.‚Äù She pointed at Lilia with her fork.

       Lilia was trying so hard to be cold to Agatha, and it hurt like hell. She knew why she had to do it. She couldn‚Äôt let Agatha fall in love with her. Lorna would murder Lilia.

      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She loved Norma Wu not only because she was Lorna‚Äôs mother but also because she had raised Lorna to be an amazing woman.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       However, she could have done without Norma‚Äôs lectures, especially when Lilia would take her side every single time.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       The five women walked into the large home on Christmas Eve to be welcomed by the small, rambunctious eight-year-old, followed by a joyful but judgy older woman.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWelcome, girls! Come in, get settled in your rooms! You must be Wanda and Natasha!‚Äù Norma addressed the two younger women.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúAlice, show these two to the guest room. I hope you two don‚Äôt mind sharing a bed.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She added, raising an eyebrow at Agatha. Norma just assumed everyone was gay at this point. Agatha shrugged. She had an inkling, but no clear confirmation yet.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúCome with me! Where‚Äôs your accent from? Gran says our house is like the United Nations!‚Äù She chattered as she skipped down the hallway.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Gran turned towards the other three, a finger in their faces. ‚ÄúNo sex, no drugs, no alcohol. Do you three understand me?‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha scoffed. ‚ÄúAlways such fun, Norma.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúAgatha Evanora Harkness,‚Äù Norma began, causing Agatha to wince. She hated her middle name and wanted to legally change it to Fucking. Norma was five foot even and was truly the only person on the planet that terrified her. Especially when she used Agatha‚Äôs middle name.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù She agreed.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúGood, Lorna and Agatha, take everyone‚Äôs things to their rooms, presents under the tree. Agatha is staying with you, Lorna, in the other guest room. Lilia, I need to see you in the kitchen.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Norma turned and walked toward the kitchen while the three women exchanged glances. Whatever was about to happen to Lilia wasn‚Äôt good. There were sharp objects in there.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia and Norma reached the kitchen, and Norma pointed to the table, instructing her to sit.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúAny progress with either of them?‚Äù Norma asked, taking a seat.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lilia looked defeated. ‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt gotten worse since they‚Äôre busy filming, so that‚Äôs something? It helps that Agatha has the girls now, and she‚Äôs been roping Lorna in with that.‚Äù Lilia reported.
      </span>

</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been over a year. Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs time to end it?‚Äù Norma asked.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been done this road enough, Norma. I brought them here for Christmas like you wanted. Now, you can try your intervention on them, not me. There are two people involved in my situation, not just me.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>

      </span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha had just asked her if she believed in soulmates. Lilia was a student of tarot. Of course, she believed in soulmates.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She sure as hell wasn‚Äôt telling Agatha that.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She remained cold, distant, and casual‚Äîan older fling.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She believed Agatha had a soulmate somewhere.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia Calderu had to believe she was not that person, though, and it killed her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Right now, she was not letting her emotions color their moment, lying here.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Right now, she focused on Lorna‚Äôs warning and her duty to Agatha, to keep her at an emotional arm‚Äôs length.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Instead of romance and sweetness, Lilia reverted to her now well-practiced advice on the challenge of maintaining a long-term, steady relationship with the amount of fame Agatha held. She deliberately lectured and called Agatha ‚Äòmy pet‚Äô to reduce the intimacy she felt as they recovered from another beautiful time together.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Her tactics worked. Lilia could feel the discomfort and slight hurt from Agatha as the wedge she hammered in place deepened the gap between them. The longer Lilia had to play cold and distant, the harder it became to separate the two identities.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It‚Äôs why, though she tried to stay away, stay strong, and stay cold, the infatuation won out, and they always fell back into bed.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia could barely resist Agatha, and she knew that could be as damaging as any addiction.

<em>
<span>
       Agatha, at an old and wise twenty-six years old, knew that something was going on with the two redheads. It once more brought up the mystery of that night two years ago. There had been no reason for Natasha not to murder Agatha that night, but Natasha hadn‚Äôt expected Wanda‚Äôs presence‚Äî or at least, that‚Äôs what the former assassin kept saying. Agatha knew she was lying. No, Natasha hadn‚Äôt just been distracted by Wanda; she had been mesmerized. Cupid‚Äôs arrow struck the assassin as she confronted her target, abandoning her assignment, and spent the next two years watching Wanda figure out her feelings.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Now, here sat a Wanda, who seemed younger than her twenty years, asking Agatha how to tell if she liked girls. Agatha knew she should be helpful and supportive. Instead, she cackled. Agatha had always known she was gay. She took one look at boys as a kid, said no thanks, and started going after girls and women.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Now, sweet, innocent, girl-next-door Wanda Maximoff, who had been raised by Agatha for the past four years, was asking for help deciphering her confusing feelings for Nat.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúJust go fuck her, Wanda. That will be pretty telling,‚Äù Agatha said after she finished laughing.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou are of no help,‚Äù Wanda said, getting up to storm off.

</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúAngel, no, seriously. Do you have any desire to do anything with any of these PR guys you‚Äôve been set up with?‚Äù Agatha asked.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Wanda sighed, hands gathered on one hip. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWhat about Nat?‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Wanda looked at the ceiling and blew out a breath.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI want to do unspeakable things and grow old with her,‚Äù she finally admitted.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWelcome to club lesbian. Your membership card will be in the mail. Go get your girl,‚Äù Agatha grinned.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha watched as Wanda climbed the stairs, knowing she was headed to Nat‚Äôs room.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       If only her own situation were that easy. She was happy to see that these two dear friends would share a sweet moment and maybe more. But their happiness and Wanda‚Äôs excitement stirred a hidden pain in her. She and Lilia had been going back and forth for three years now, and things were only getting more confusing.

<p>
<em>
<span>
       They had had a nice night, and Lilia, still vibrant and alluring at forty-one years old, had so wished she could be ‚Äòfriend‚Äô Lilia to Agatha right then, but those lines were blurring more frequently. She was in too deep, and she knew she should have listened to Lorna four years ago when this had started. Lilia scolded herself. She should have put a stop to this a long time ago. She still should stop it now.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       To no one‚Äôs surprise, Agatha had grown more beautiful and was intoxicating at twenty-seven. Lilia couldn‚Äôt get enough of her. There was no gum or patch for this. No twelve-step program. No rehab.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha and Lorna had tried rehab and failed for their vices. Lilia didn‚Äôt even have that option. Here she was, trying to get Agatha just to drink wine and not the myriad of alcohols and liquors she had in the fridge. The kid referred to Smirnoff as ‚Äòalcoholic kool-aid‚Äô.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia couldn‚Äôt believe Agatha had brought up Madonna. She knew she had done it just to goad her, too. Lilia couldn‚Äôt stand Madonna‚Äôs acting or singing. Agatha adored her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It was a good night with their usual banter, the easiness they built up in the past thirteen years, and then it happened.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha had her legs tucked under her. She was effortlessly beautiful and always had been.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúLilia, do you love me?‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had stilled, turning towards Agatha, trying to decide how to answer. They had used that term platonically for years. But no one had ever said so romantically.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúOf course I do,‚Äù Lilia replied, as she had done so many times before, silently praying Agatha would drop it. Knowing she wouldn‚Äôt. Her eyebrows knitted together, preparing what to say next.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúNo, I mean, are you in love with me?‚Äù Agatha took a deep breath. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that I am so deeply in love with you. You won‚Äôt let me tell anyone we‚Äôre seeing each other, while I want to scream it from the rooftops. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and you laugh it off, insisting we see other people.‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs eyes were watery. Lilia hated being the one who made her cry.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha was right. Every time she brought up that line of conversation, Lilia pulled back, and they stopped things for a bit.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Every single time, they found their way back into each other‚Äôs beds.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Every single time, Lorna got pissed at Lilia.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúLorna knows,‚Äù Lilia replied, hoping it was some small consolation. She so badly wanted to hold Agatha, console her, and kiss away her sadness. But she didn‚Äôt reach out, steeling herself against the emotion and guilt that bubbled within.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha gave a small cry of frustration.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúOf course she does! I can‚Äôt help that she figured it out! Stop ignoring the question!‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia was surprised by Agatha‚Äôs harsh tone. Lorna had suggested she act like she figured it out and not tell Agatha that Lilia had outright told her. Half-truths abounded in their small family.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYes, I love you, Agatha, but those things are impossible. I don‚Äôt want any of that, and you know it. I will not explain it to you again. Now, don‚Äôt go ruining a good night before it‚Äôs even begun.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia reached for Agatha‚Äôs cheek as Agatha retreated backward. It was a knife to Lilia‚Äôs heart, and she fought back tears herself. All she really wanted to do was apologize for being this way. Yes, she was in love with Agatha, something that was hard to admit to herself, but she was not a one-woman woman and never would be.It truly wasn‚Äôt who she was at heart. Knowing that while she could give in and be happy for a little while, her true nature would eventually emerge and ruin both their relationship and the beautiful woman with whom she was in love.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúLeave,‚Äù Agatha said abruptly.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Lilia was shocked. Agatha had never kicked her out before.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou heard me, leave.‚Äù She said, standing up and walking to her bedroom.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia watched Agatha walk down the hall as she got up to leave herself. She and Lorna had a New York apartment they shared, and she would call Lorna once she got back. That would give Agatha time to call her first.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha came to Lilia‚Äôs four days later to apologize. Lilia planned to be Lilia, the friend. Forgive Aggie and put an end to everything for good.
      </span>

</p>
<p>

       She was only thirty, but she felt so much older than Wanda. Things had been going well for her younger sister, and when the scandal broke as Wanda planned her proposal to Nat, Agatha knew it wouldn‚Äôt happen. Agatha‚Äôs own ‚Äòrelationship,‚Äô if you could call it that, was doomed, and here, Wanda had two people madly in love with her and willing to dedicate their lives to her in any capacity.
      </span>

       The pictures had broken, tabloids and proper newspapers alike displayed them on front pages, and Agatha wanted to burn the whole world down for Wanda.

<em>
<span>
       Is this how Lorna felt about Agatha at thirteen years older? Fiercely protective? Lorna was slowly getting worse but was still a proud mom. The relationship between Lorna and Lilia who was one year her senior, was starting to fissure, and Agatha couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if it was her fault. No, it was Lilia. Lilia who was two different people with her, and it was fucking with Agatha and had for going on seven years now.

<em>

       ‚ÄúI love you too, Aggie. You really are my sister, you know that?‚Äù She said between sobs.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha truly believed that you didn‚Äôt need blood to make a family, and she had believed that since she was sixteen. Vision had told Wanda they could call off the engagement, and Nat and Vision both supported Wanda no matter what. Good thing, too, because Agatha happened to know an Italian who could make a few phone calls if needed.
      </span>

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha had called Lorna and Lilia and met them at Lilia‚Äôs. Lorna and Agatha were never truly sober anymore. Lorna usually had at least taken a pill of some type, and Agatha was always running on a shot of something. Lilia didn‚Äôt know what to do with either of them anymore. Agatha stormed in, dropping the newspaper in Lilia‚Äôs lap.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI know the shady shit you do behind the scenes, did you have a hand in this? I told you about Wanda‚Äôs plans, and I swear to Lorna if you messed with my sister, not only are we over, but I will murder you right here,‚Äù she said menacingly, eyes devoid of any caring feeling.

       Lilia gave her a look. ‚ÄúAgatha, I know I can be cold, but I care about those girls too, and I am rooting for them. I would never do that. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone, this wasn‚Äôt me. We all know that the studios would take a huge hit if America‚Äôs STRAIGHT Sweetheart came out as gay too.‚Äù

Lorna shrugged and passed the pipe and lighter back to Agatha.

       ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt protect them from everything, and it‚Äôs one of the many reasons Alice stays with Mom. Speaking of, Mom sent pictures! She basically has Alice‚Äôs friend living with them. Cute kid. Here.‚Äù Lorna pulled out a stack of pictures, handing them to Lilia. Agatha put the pipe and lighter on the glass coffee table and moved to sit by Lilia to look at the pictures. She laughed as she saw the pictures of Alice and the other fourteen-year-old sitting on inflatable furniture, sticking their tongues out.

Mom hopes she sticks around or her parents disappear and leave the kid. It makes me feel less guilty for only having one kid.‚Äù Lorna got up to rummage in the pantry.

<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia hated it when Agatha brought up having a baby. It meant she had to don her ice queen persona again. This back-and-forth had been going on for ten years. It happened so frequently that Lilia could barely keep track of which version of herself she was anymore.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúAgatha, I‚Äôm too old to have or raise a child, and with your schedule? I would be a primary parent. People would know we were together then.‚Äù Agatha was almost thirty-three, and Lilia herself was nearly forty-seven. She was scheduled to have a hysterectomy soo,n and while she regretted never having kids, she was trying to push it out of her mind. She still didn‚Äôt want to risk her career. There was talk of the principal retiring, and she was on the shortlist for it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right about me. I can‚Äôt be a good parent with this life.‚Äù Agatha conceded.

<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt risk being your mother.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia wanted to take the words back as soon as she said them and saw the hurt on Agatha‚Äôs face. She had gotten so good at being cold when she was this person that it came naturally, and she hated it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia wondered if she had lost who she once was and their relationship had changed so much. Even when they were being friends, it didn‚Äôt come as easily. Agatha‚Äôs alcohol use had gotten so bad that Lilia‚Äôs main concern was the withdrawals in Agatha‚Äôs preparations to have a child. Could her body even handle it? She‚Äôd been drinking for so long that she wasn‚Äôt sure how she would handle it. Lilia knew that Agatha would be an amazing mother.

       Lilia hadn‚Äôt known that Agatha had taken that as Lilia‚Äôs final decision. She had gotten good at continuing to act like she was drinking. But, she had stopped last Halloween and had been preparing to start treatments and trying for a baby.

<span>
       Agatha had gone to Norma‚Äôs for a couple of reasons. She needed to bring Lorna back to LA to continue filming their show, and she needed to tell Lorna that she was pregnant. The fertility treatments and artificial insemination had worked. Agatha was going to be a mom.
      </span>

       She hadn‚Äôt told Lilia yet and had no idea how she would react.

<span>
       ‚ÄúI know, and that‚Äôs part of why I‚Äôm here. I need her to come back and finish filming. I‚Äôll keep an eye on her. I‚Äôll also get her into rehab as soon as we‚Äôre done. I‚Äôm sober, Norma. If I can do it, so can she.‚Äù Agatha explained.

       Norma squinted at her. ‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù Norma didn‚Äôt trust her.

       Norma stepped aside to let her in. Agatha walked down the familiar hallway lined with pictures of Alice and the other teenage girl. It was late, and she didn‚Äôt even knock. Norma was awake, and she looked up from her reading. Agatha set down her overnight bag on the floor before she made Norma scoot over.

<em>

       ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it. I‚Äôm going to get ready for bed. Do you want me to stay with you tonight?‚Äù Agatha knew Lorna would have nightmares at this point in the process.

       Lorna looked at her lap and nodded. She was forty-six, but at that moment looked like a vulnerable little girl.

<span>
       Agatha was nervous. Wanda and Nat were overseas and they didn‚Äôt even know she was pregnant. hey certainly didn‚Äôt know she had been in a quasi-relationship with someone for ten years. Lilia was coming over and she was going to tell her about the pregnancy.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not drinking?‚Äù Lilia asked, surprise written all over her face.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúLilia, I haven‚Äôt had a drop of alcohol since last Halloween. I‚Äôve been faking it.‚Äù Agatha replied casually.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>

       Lilia was suspicious and confused. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

       They were sitting in the living room at Agatha‚Äôs, she was eating blueberries and drinking water, gauging Lilia‚Äôs reactions closely.

</em>
</p>

<em>

       Lilia had just taken a sip of tea and nearly choked.

      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúPregnant? Yes. Due in May,‚Äù Agatha answered before Lilia finished the question. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt expect you to continue this with me, to marry me, to do anything. I know this isn‚Äôt what you wanted and I respect that. If that side of this stops, then I do want our friendship back, Lilia,‚Äù Agatha laid it out. She wanted Lilia to remain in her life. They didn‚Äôt have to keep up whatever they had, but she needed Lilia in her life, in this child‚Äôs life.

You love her too, in your own infatuation way,, but you‚Äôre not the settling-down type and that‚Äôs okay. She doesn‚Äôt hold it against you as long as she gets to be with you. This whole thing never should have started. AS I SAID. She‚Äôs not even asking for you to marry her or help her raise the kid, she just wants you to stay in her life and be her friend again Lilia, yet you‚Äôre in too far and you can‚Äôt separate the two Lilias anymore.‚Äù Lorna looked at her, face hard. ‚ÄúI told you this would happen, and Lilia, all you had to do was listen, but just like always, you think you know best.‚Äù

       Lilia left SHIELD in September, she hadn‚Äôt told anyone, and it was part of the reason she had been such an ass lately. That and her hysterectomy. The loss of children she never had and never would grated on her soul, but she wasn‚Äôt saying that out loud to anyone. She regretted what she had said to Lorna, and she didn‚Äôt mean it. Not really. She loved Lorna and she would never hold her addiction against her, just like she didn‚Äôt hold Agatha‚Äôs against her.

       Agatha looked at Lorna, she knew she had been crying silently, as Lorna handed her tissues.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúOh sweetie, I am so sorry. I love you so much. What do you need?‚Äù Lorna took it upon herself to wipe Agatha‚Äôs face.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúJust take me home?‚Äù She asked meekly. She didn‚Äôt want to be here in this gown anymore, she just wanted to be home, in her bed.

       When Agatha told Lilia, she didn‚Äôt react, just nodded. They were to be married in three days on the beach. She craved Lilia‚Äôs love and warmth. Agatha had lost a baby but all Lilia could do was nod.
      </span>

      </span>

       Lorna turned to Agatha, sorrow in her eyes.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha fell to her knees, sobbing.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She lost her entire future in three days.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna walked her up to the beach house and helped her get changed. That day, Agatha drank and cried herself to sleep. It was the first drink that crossed her lips in over a year. Lorna would stay and make certain Agatha remained safe. Her maternal instincts, repressed for so long, were on heightened alert. When she went off to get Agatha some water to help flush her system, she returned to a scene that broke her heart for her pseudo daughter for the second time that day. Agatha was finally asleep, her tri-goddess locket in her hand. On the floor lay a small lock of hair. Lorna didn‚Äôt have to look closely to understand what had happened. Agatha had removed Lilia from her life.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Once Lorna was certain Agatha was safely asleep, she drove over to Lilia‚Äôs and stormed through the door.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúHOW COULD YOU!?‚Äù She screamed. Lorna saw red.

</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be tied down, I just, I can‚Äôt Lorna.‚Äù Lilia rubbed her cheek. It stung, but she deserved it.

</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou have to talk to her, she deserves that much. She thinks you left her because she miscarried.‚Äù Lorna was so mad she could spit nails.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI think the baby clouded my judgment‚Ä¶‚Äù She told Lorna about the reading.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYOU AGREED TO GET MARRIED BASED ON TAROT?!‚Äù Murder was the only thing on Lorna‚Äôs mind.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI knew you wouldn‚Äôt understand. I think I misunderstood the new beginnings card. I was offered the principal position at SHIELD, and I think that‚Äôs where I need to be. I also can‚Äôt do that while with Agatha. Neither of us would truly be happy. She needs someone closer to her age, or younger. I would eventually be unfaithful, we both know that. She needs someone who can compliment her lifestyle and career, someone who hasn‚Äôt fucked with her for ten years. Someone who doesn‚Äôt tell half-truths, who loves her fiercely. None of that is me, Lorna.‚Äù Lilia tried to defend herself and knew she was failing.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou basically fucked with my daughter, Lilia,‚Äù Lorna spat.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get you, Lorna! You treat her like this daughter you never had and let her come between us. But you HAVE a daughter that you NEVER see. Agatha is only thirteen years younger than you, and you‚Äôre closer to her than your own flesh and blood. Why is that? Why do you choose her over Alice? Over everyone?‚Äù Lilia was furious.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúBecause we saw what growing up in this world did to Agatha. You know what having famous parents has done to those brats you teach. How entitled and spoiled they are. Alice is none of those things. Alice is grounded. Alice saw a kid in trouble and acted like we did, Lilia. Your brats wouldn‚Äôt do that. Agatha was an alcoholic before she was ten, just like other kids in this town. Do you think I want Alice around me? No. She doesn‚Äôt need to see me like this! Alice has a better chance in life because of my choices.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúIf I can shape Agatha at all, I‚Äôm going to fucking do it, and God knows I‚Äôm trying. You were trying too until you decided to fuck her and ended up breaking her, and she is broken, Lilia. She is one of the strongest women I know and I don‚Äôt know if I can pick up the pieces this time after what you‚Äôve done.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna had never spoken to Lilia this way. They had never spoken to each other this harshly and they had never fought like this. Not over Lorna‚Äôs demons, not over other disagreements, nothing.
      </span>

</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI never meant for any of this to happen. I had to separate myself into two different people. I want to console her and tell her everything is okay, yet I‚Äôm the one that did this. I lost one of the people closest to me.‚Äù Lilia sobbed.

<p>
<em>

       ‚ÄúHaving an epidural doesn‚Äôt make you weak, sweetie. It helps you relax and means Wanda leaves here with her hand intact, which Nat will appreciate‚Ä¶one day.‚Äù Lorna affirmed and winked at Wanda and Nat.

They were trying to put more effort into the athletics department and it was taking a lot of time to find quality coaches, and she was starting to scout college players.
      </span>

       Lilia had told Agatha the same thing she had told Lorna, when Agatha finally agreed to talk to her again. Lilia was honest, even including that the pregnancy had clouded her judgment and that she still loved her, but not in the way that justified marriage.

       Lorna‚Äôs head shot up. Lilia had struck a nerve. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm not the one who was in the wrong, Lilia. I‚Äôm not the one who broke Agatha. I‚Äôm not the one who caused the damage.

       Oscars Night
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       After winning an Oscar, Lorna had insisted on going to an after-party. Agatha had wanted to take Lorna home. She wasn‚Äôt doing well at all and Agatha knew the end was near, something in her gut told her it was. Lorna hadn‚Äôt told anyone about her diagnosis. Only Agatha, Lilia, and Norma knew. She allowed everyone to think she had relapsed. The way she looked certainly supported that narrative.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She didn‚Äôt want anyone‚Äôs sympathy, didn‚Äôt want anyone to think of her as a sob story that had beaten her addiction only to be taken by some cruel twist of fate. So she controlled the narrative. The Witches‚Äô Road was a dark movie. She said it had consumed her, taken a toll on her psychologically that she couldn‚Äôt deal with alone.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha hated it.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia was nowhere to be found.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Wanda, and everyone else, believed it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       When Lorna collapsed at the party and 911 was called, Agatha knew it was the end.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She knew Lorna wasn‚Äôt going to make it to the hospital.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna made her promise to watch after Alice.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha rode in the ambulance.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna was pronounced dead before they even reached the hospital.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna had always said she would go out on her own terms, and she had.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It didn‚Äôt matter what she took. But she had.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha wasn‚Äôt angry with her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha knew Lorna didn‚Äôt want to suffer in the final days.
      </span>

<em>
<span>
       They knew it was stage 4.

</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Afterward, she found that Lorna had left letters. A journal. An envelope of documents.
      </span>

</p>
<p>

       Agatha kept the letters addressed to her and would give everything else to Alice.

       The Funeral
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Norma had closed the funeral to celebrities. The media said it was because she was angry and blamed Hollywood for Lorna‚Äôs death.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       In reality, it was because she didn‚Äôt want it to turn into a media circus.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She knew Agatha and Wanda would be there in disguise. She had asked them to do so. Alice and Rio didn‚Äôt know that. A few other celebrities had done it that way.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia had disguised herself as well.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha, Wanda, and Nat hugged Norma out of sight in a back hallway. Wanda and Nat offered their condolences before slipping into the main area, leaving Agatha and Norma alone.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúNorma, I‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs voice betrayed her as she started to cry.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúAgatha, it‚Äôs not your fault. You can‚Äôt heal the sick,‚Äù Norma looked at Agatha the way Lorna did, causing Agatha to cry harder.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have to bury your child,‚Äù Agatha admonished in between her crying.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Norma was crying herself as she looked at her tenderly. ‚ÄúOnce Lorna fell into this cursed lifestyle, I knew I would outlive her. I started having some hope when she was pregnant and sober, but then I found myself raising my grandchild. When Lorna finally achieved sobriety, I thought maybe she would be a parent to Alice and outlive me. Fate is a cruel mistress. I hold nothing against you, Agatha, and neither does Alice. You‚Äôll be able to make it up to her in due time, and I trust you will. Right now, you need to grieve. I grieved my daughter long ago, and while I am grieving, I always knew that this was the most likely outcome. I used to think so about you, too. You proved me wrong. Now, go talk with Alice,‚Äù Norma hugged her. Though Norma was crying, but had much more composure than Agatha did. Norma turned to head back into the main room before pausing at the door and turning her head slightly.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúLilia is here.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       With that, Norma pushed through the door and disappeared.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha and Wanda waited until after the funeral to pull Alice aside.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúThis is from your mother.‚Äù Agatha handed her the large manilla envelope. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot in here she wanted you to have. You also need to read this,‚Äù Agatha handed her a letter. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have a lot of questions kid. You need to call me. I know you graduate this year and there‚Äôs a job at a school in LA if you want it‚Ä¶‚Äù
      </span>

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Alice cut her off, ‚ÄúWhy would I go there, Agatha? I saw what Hollywood did to my mom.‚Äù Alice‚Äôs eyes were dark, haunted. ‚ÄúIt took her away from me, Agatha. I only saw her on holidays and when she tried to get clean.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Alice‚Äôs words stabbed at Agatha, releasing guilt that had built up for years. Hollywood hadn‚Äôt taken Lorna away from Alice, Agatha had. Agatha was sixteen when Alice was born, and Lorna had been putting everything she had into making sure Agatha was safe, that Agatha was okay. That Agatha had a mother figure.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       When Lorna had found out she was pregnant, Agatha and Lilia insisted she keep the baby.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna took Alice to Norma, ‚ÄúMom, I can‚Äôt possibly care for an infant in this environment. She needs a Norma, not a Lorna.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia and Agatha had tried to convince Lorna to raise Alice with their help, but Lorna refused. She was adamant that Alice grow up far away from the life they led.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha knew Alice was better for it, but it didn‚Äôt mean she had any less guilt.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúJust read the letter, please. I don‚Äôt know what it says, but it was important to your mom,‚Äù Agatha hugged her and left. Wanda and Nat followed behind.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       As they left, Agatha saw Lilia out of the corner of her eye. ‚ÄúYou two go ahead, I‚Äôll be right there.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Wanda shrugged and she and Nat went to the car as Agatha turned and walked to Lilia.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know if you‚Äôd come,‚Äù Agatha said softly. She expected to be angry, but couldn‚Äôt find the energy.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúOf course I did,‚Äù Lilia stared straight ahead.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you came, Lorna told me‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha couldn‚Äôt finish the sentence.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia looked down. ‚ÄúHow did it happen?‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúHer own terms. In my arms. We made it to the back of the ambulance,‚Äù Agatha swallowed hard. It would forever be a core memory for her.

<em>

       ‚ÄúDramatic as always.‚Äù

       Nicky would be in Pre-K that year, and SHIELD was the only institution Agatha trusted, whether she wanted to or not. Lilia of all people was droning on and on as she showed her around. They were doing a pretty decent job at pretending like they didn‚Äôt know each other. Agatha couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, and they were in a deserted hallway in the elementary building.
      </span>

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúLilia, cut the bullshit,‚Äù Agatha stopped walking and leaned against a wall. Her heart still ached from the loss of Lorna, and Lilia reminded her of what she had lost. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only person I trust to oversee Nicky in a sea of children.‚Äù

       Lilia had only professional interactions with Agatha. That is to say, only in her professional capacity, although she took every one of them personally. Agatha was always a fierce competitor, and as a mother, she was unbeatable. Every time Nicky found himself in trouble, there was Agatha, convincing Lilia to let him off the hook. She knew Agatha thought it was because of her powerful personality, but¬† Lilia had never overcome the guilt and sadness of the losses of the most important women in her life. She let it color her interactions with Agatha and allowed the starlet to get away with anything. Even when against school policy or when it dealt with Wanda's twin boys.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha always treated Lilia with a side of cynicism, but her anger lost its edge the day that Lilia showed up to the house with a bag of sick-day material.

<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia was at Agatha‚Äôs house, Nicky was a freshman, fourteen, and had mono. She came to make him soup like she had done for Agatha when she had caught mono from another actress when she was sixteen.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha opened the door and her eyes went wide seeing Lilia with the oldest pot on the planet.
      </span>

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúIs the tetanus free?‚Äù She asked once she had recovered.

<em>

       ‚ÄúLilia, what the hell are you doing?‚Äù Agatha followed her.

<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúDo you remember when you had mono?‚Äù Lilia asked, placing the pot of soup on the stove and turning on the burner.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha smiled at the memory. ‚ÄúUnfortunately. You made me some Italian soup from scratch in that same pot, which I swear made me feel so much better. You also had some type of tea, and homemade bread, made me watch The Wizard of Oz, and sleep,‚Äù Agatha recalled.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúAll of that, except the sleep, is in that bag,‚Äù Lilia gestured to a bag on the counter.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha pulled everything out of the bag and smiled, yet she was confused. They didn‚Äôt have this type of relationship and hadn‚Äôt in a long time.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this Lilia?‚Äù Agatha leaned against the kitchen counter and crossed her arms over her chest.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia stirred the soup as it heated, turning her head to look at Agatha.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou were always terrible at taking care of the sick, and Agatha, I do care about him, and you too, I know things may never be the same between us, but if I can occasionally do something for him, and maybe even you, I‚Äôm going to. So excuse me while I finish this magical soup for the kid,‚Äù Lilia fixed Nicky's soup, bread, and tea, and pushed Agatha to take it up to Nicky. He was surprised to see real soup, not something out of the can, and ate eagerly.

<span>
       Agatha sighed. If she was being honest with herself, she missed Lilia, the old Lilia. Her friend and the woman that would take care of her when she was sick, or teach her how to cook. The woman who was caring for her son, that was the Lilia she missed. Not the woman whose memory was tattooed on her hip. No, that was a different woman entirely, wasn‚Äôt it?
      </span>

</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       By early 2024, Agatha and Lilia were on even ground with each other. Nicky was calming down. He had earned the starting quarterback position the previous fall after the previous quarterback was injured. He knew that in order to remain the quarterback for the varsity squad, he had to keep any and all pranks to a harmless minimum. He had also started seeing Morgan Stark, someone he had known since he was four, in a much different light. He didn‚Äôt want to lose his chance in any of these respects, so he adjusted his behavior accordingly. Now, Lilia had fewer reasons to call Agatha to deal with her son, and Agatha had fewer reasons to show her sharp tongue. It was a new equilibrium. It wasn‚Äôt much. But, it was a start.

       Alice abruptly hung up the phone as she got up from the couch and headed towards the door, grabbing her bag. ‚ÄúI have to go to San Francisco, I‚Äôll be back in a few days. It‚Äôs an emergency,‚Äù she said over her shoulder at the other four members of the coven.

       Rio Vidal would be the perfect addition to SHIELD. But she was very much a broken woman, physically and emotionally. It didn‚Äôt take a psychic to see that. It reminded Lilia of a memory she had buried from long ago. No one should be hurt like that without a chance to heal. Somehow, she had to give Rio just that chance. Alice would be key to that. So would the little family that Agatha had pulled Alice into. Maybe Rio could also fill part of that gaping wound she had opened in Agatha? But that was one stubborn fifty-year-old woman. Maybe Rio would be up to that challenge or distraction, too? Perhaps with enough work, there could be room again for Lilia in their lives. It wouldn‚Äôt be what it once was, but to have Aggie back in her life would be enough.

      This was a hard one to write. I always knew that Lilia had turned herself into the villain in Agatha's story, though she never intended for that to happen, but damn.
     </p>
<p>
      Also, LORNA?! God.
     </p>
<p>
      Damnit Lorna.
      <br/>
      For those of you that don't remember Agatha and Rio meeting before, Chapter 3 and 5 reference it, though it's vague.
      <br/>
      Now we know why Agatha made sure the boys went to therapy as kids. Well-adjusted humans with healthy coping mechanisms from the start.
     </p>
<p>
      Does she still drink? Sure. Does she sometimes drink too much? Maybe.

      Present Day
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lilia was Agatha‚Äôs ex.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt as though the walls of the familiar venue were closing in on her. She looked around frantically. She couldn‚Äôt fall apart here, not on her sister‚Äôs big day. She would never do this to Alice. She had to get out and get out now. Rio slipped into a back hall, thankful that she had driven. Agatha could call her driver. Rio didn‚Äôt care. Seriously, fuck Agatha. No wonder Agatha hadn‚Äôt wanted to tell her. Lilia?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio needed to talk to Alice, but she couldn‚Äôt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had so many questions for Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had so many questions for Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio needed an Ouija board.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio didn‚Äôt know what to do.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stumbled through the back hallways towards the parking garage, stopping to empty the contents of her stomach. She was reeling from the revelation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She knew that Agatha and Lilia had known each other for a long time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Since Agatha had been fourteen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She thought back to The Harkness Brag Room. Why weren‚Äôt there more pictures with Lilia in that room?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She retched yet again on the concrete, leaning against an unfamiliar vehicle. Unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt Lilia‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Snippets of previous conversations sprung to her mind as she climbed into her car.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI was young, twenty-three, and I had chased her for years‚Ä¶‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a feral scream. Rio remembered when she stood in Lilia‚Äôs office to ask if she could experiment with her chemistry class using open flames and different chemicals. Lilia had, of course, agreed. But, as she watched Lilia consider her request, Rio had noticed several pictures around the office, including one of Lilia, Lorna Wu, and Agatha on the opening night of Rent.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Yet, in every picture Agatha had from that night, Lilia was missing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She drove away from the venue toward Agatha‚Äôs house to collect Raven. They couldn‚Äôt stay there right now. The urge to snoop and find evidence of Lilia being Swords crept in. Rio quickly dismissed it. She had all the evidence she needed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI call her Swords.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio recalled seeing the deck of tarot cards in Lilia‚Äôs office. Lilia also had a few signed Playbills and posters hanging around her office. She had several of Agatha‚Äôs, mainly from 2006 and earlier, which fit with the timeline that formed in Rio‚Äôs mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She grew more conflicted by the second.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio needed her emotional support Raven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then she needed to return to her apartment and plan which of these Hollywood cougars to confront first.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was angry.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was disgusted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was hurt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It had been thirty minutes since Agatha had last seen Rio. One minute, Rio was standing and observing everything from the side, taking it all in. Agatha looked over and winked at her, eliciting a gorgeous smile. Rio, in that orange dress that Alice had picked out with her. Rio‚Äôs hair had gotten longer in the past few months, and she kept tossing it over her shoulders. Rio, with her brown eyes that expressed everything and saw into the depths of Agatha‚Äôs soul. Rio, the woman who had absolutely shown Agatha what love was truly supposed to be, even if Rio‚Äôs own history caused doubts. They had been able to work through them all - together and in such a short time. Weddings had never made Agatha wistful or weepy, but now? With Rio? She was starting to think of a future that she had previously thought impossible.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And it no longer terrified her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But at this moment, Agatha could not locate Rio. Agatha‚Äôs eyes scanned the area for any sign of her and saw none. She took a mental headcount of the coven and children, four sapphics, two adult queer men, six teens, herself, no Rio. She pulled out her phone and called, straight to voicemail. Agatha began to worry but didn‚Äôt want to alarm Alice. The psychotic blonde had been sent to The Island, never to be heard from again, so she didn‚Äôt need to worry about that. She locked eyes with Wanda as she headed toward the redheads.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda saw the alarm in Agatha‚Äôs eyes, no matter how hard she was trying to hide it. ‚ÄúAggie, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù She asked, meeting her in the middle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHave you seen Rio? Her phone is going straight to voicemail.‚Äù Agatha was trying to appear calm, though Wanda saw right through it. Wanda looked over at Nat, who had her phone out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tracking her now. It's a good thing she never takes that necklace off.‚Äù Nat looked up at both of them. ‚ÄúOh, I can track the necklaces whether the buttons are pushed or not. Emergency feature. Seems Rio already left. It shows she‚Äôs headed back to the compound.‚Äù She looked at Agatha, clearly confused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda gave Agatha a look. ‚ÄúWhat did you do this time??‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha threw her hands up. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything, I promise.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMaybe the festivities led her to have doubts again?‚Äù Wanda wondered out loud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, I think we‚Äôre okay there. The only thing I‚Äôve kept back is ‚Äòthe ex‚Äôs‚Äô identity. But, I haven‚Äôt told any of you that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha threw her hands up in the air in frustration.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMaybe something just happened to her. How did this end up as my fault? Stop giving me that look. Your face is going to freeze like that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pulled out her phone when it dinged with a text from Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

</p>

</p>

<span>
      Agatha waved her phone at Wanda and Nat. ‚ÄúSee, what did I tell you?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúDo you believe her?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha bit her lip and shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, but I‚Äôm about to be the best girlfriend ever. Tell Alice and Jen I love them, and take my kid home, please. I need to go take care of a sick Rio.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had gotten back to the apartment and found a spiral notebook. She knew she couldn‚Äôt just march over to Lilia‚Äôs without being entirely sure that it was Lilia. The Swords that Agatha talked about was cold and distant. A heartless bitch that didn‚Äôt love Agatha and had left her at the altar.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The Lilia Calderu she knew was manipulative and cryptic, sure, but she had also let Rio off on late notice to go gallivanting around the world with Agatha. She had given her insight into Agatha and noticed when she was anxious.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Frantically, she wrote down everything she had thought of while in the car. Starting with when she met Lilia a year ago. She knew she had to sort out her thoughts before confronting either of the older women.

      Rio stopped writing and thought back on different interactions and what she knew. Lilia being Swords would explain why she had such a soft spot towards Nicky, but so would Lilia and Agatha being close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia and Agatha didn‚Äôt act like they had been close for thirty-seven years. They didn‚Äôt act like bitter exes, either.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was some weird middle-ground.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That also explained why no one else knew. Leave it to Agatha to not want her past to cloud other people's judgment of someone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So WHY had Lilia pushed Rio towards Agatha? She needed to talk to Lilia. Lilia had emotionally scarred Agatha and ruined her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This same woman had helped Rio find a home and allowed her to coach again, knowing it would bring her joy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Had she done that out of loyalty to Alice, because of her last name?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      What in the holy hell was happening? It was eight on Saturday night, and the reception had been wrapping up, so hopefully, Lilia would be home by now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio grabbed her keys and headed to Lilia‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had soup, crackers, Gatorade, and everything she needed in case Rio had actually fallen sick. If she had had time, she would make soup herself. It was something Lilia had taught her how to do that week Nicky had mono.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The week that an unspoken truce had been made between them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha even had a giant stock pot now that would one day also be ancient and possibly come with a side of tetanus.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       If you‚Äôre lucky,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Lilia had said, shaking her head at Agatha‚Äôs sarcasm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had even picked up treats for Raven and flowers for Rio. Agatha commended herself for getting better at this girlfriend thing. She was hoping she would still have a girlfriend in a few hours. Agatha was still in her suit from the reception as she knocked on Rio‚Äôs door and waited.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nothing. Just as she feared.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs asleep.‚Äù Agatha thought aloud. She used her key and let herself inside. ‚ÄúBaby? It‚Äôs just me. I brought you soup! From the place you like down on the corner!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She put everything in the kitchen and checked around the apartment, looking in the bedroom. Agatha flopped on the bed. Raven lifted her head and meowed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMy thoughts exactly, Raven.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha called Rio, surprised when she answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey baby, I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt tell you I was leaving.‚Äù Rio‚Äôs voice was hollow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I was just going to stop by and bring you some soup and other things. Maybe we can watch a movie?‚Äù Agatha asked, hoping Rio would tell her the truth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou know, I just got out of the shower and am going to bed. I‚Äôll call you tomorrow.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSure, my love. I hope you feel better. I love you, Rio.‚Äù Agatha was holding back a sob.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGoodnight, Agatha.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The line went dead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hung up the phone and cried. Raven came over and rubbed against her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat have I done now?‚Äù Agatha asked Raven, searching for answers in those wise, feline eyes. Then the horror of the possibility hit her. Could Rio have figured it out?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI should have just told her it was Lilia, and then I could have explained everything, how I was young and stupid. What young lesbian doesn‚Äôt fall for an older woman? God, Raven. Why am I like this? She went to Lilia‚Äôs, didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Deep down, Agatha knew she had.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Raven hopped down from the bed and started walking toward the living room. She stopped and looked back at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat? You want me to follow you? Did Timmy fall down a well? You know, following an immortal cat isn‚Äôt the strangest thing I‚Äôve done.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stood and followed Raven into the living room. Raven jumped onto the coffee table and pawed at the open notebook Rio had been writing in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe does know.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at everything Rio had written down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course, she has pictures in her office. Idiot.‚Äù Agatha scoffed. ‚ÄúOkay, Raven, here‚Äôs the play. I leave everything I brought for her, including your treats, I write her a note, go home and cry, and then it‚Äôs up to your mom and whatever fucking Lilia says.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Raven meowed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYeah, I know. I‚Äôm fucked, and not in any of the fun ways.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had been to Lilia‚Äôs a handful of times but had the address to the Victorian house in Angelino Heights saved in her phone. She wasn‚Äôt sure if she was glad Lilia was home or disappointed. She had just hung up with Agatha and was upset with herself. Rio had lied to Agatha and hadn‚Äôt told her she loved her because she felt conflicted. The plethora of feelings roared back to life as she walked up to the door and knocked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia was not surprised to see her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was wondering when you would figure it out.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia turned, walking back into the house, not waiting for Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was right on her heels.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo you just expected me to figure it out on my own? KNEW I would come over?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI read people, Rio. It‚Äôs how I‚Äôm so good at my job. Tea?‚Äù Lilia offered, walking to the kitchen like she had invited Rio over, not like it was possibly her last few minutes on earth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat? No! I‚Äôm pissed and homicidal, Lilia!‚Äù Rio was still following her, hands flailing. She couldn‚Äôt stay still. Lilia walked back to the living room with a cup of tea and sat down on a grey, overstuffed couch while Rio began her habit of covering every inch of floor space.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre going to walk around while you rant, but feel free to sit when you need to. You know how Agatha reads people? I taught her that,‚Äù Lilia said, sipping the hot liquid, and the subtle reminder of Lilia‚Äôs influence over Agatha enraged Rio more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRight, because you taught her everything! Which brings us to my first thing. Lilia, you were her teacher. How could you?‚Äù Rio‚Äôs words were laced with venom as she aimed them at Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI will stop you right there, Rio Vidal.‚Äù Lilia‚Äôs words came out harsh for the first time. ‚ÄúNOTHING ever happened when Agatha was underage. EVER. I didn‚Äôt ever think of her like that, and I never would.‚Äù Lilia sighed deeply as the pain of the past overtook her features. ‚ÄúDo you want the whole story, or do you just want to pace around and yell?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat I WANT is to cause some damage,‚Äù Rio said seriously, wishing she had the dagger she used to carry on her for SF-like emergencies.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLorna wanted to murder me, too. I‚Äôm honestly shocked she never did.‚Äù She looked at Rio, watching the gears turn in the woman‚Äôs mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTalk,‚Äù Rio said with all the restraint she could muster, ‚Äú but then I get to ask questions, and you will answer honestly. Without being cryptic.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia sat her tea down and looked past Rio, seeing the women of the past parade past her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI met Agatha when she was fourteen and I was twenty-eight. Her mother had been abusing her for years, and Agatha would do whatever she could to ruffle Evanora‚Äôs feathers.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia told her about young Agatha, the mischievous child star that terrorized anyone and everyone she could if she didn‚Äôt try to seduce them first. A menace first and Hollywood starlet second. Lilia had an encyclopedia of stories from the mundane to the absolutely absurd, and they were all very Agatha, from the hilarious to the horrifying. Lilia also explained Lorna‚Äôs plan to get her away from Evanora and where she came into it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúEvanora did it for us, though. Lorna and I, that is. When she caught Agatha with another girl, she lost it with her righteous bullshit. I‚Äôll never get over the irony of holier-than-thou Evanora Harkness turning Agatha into Lesbian Jesus. Regardless, she shot at Agatha in public, thankfully, she missed. The woman couldn‚Äôt hit the broad side of a barn if it were lit up like a Christmas tree. I happened to know a powerful attorney, and you know the rest, Agatha gained her freedom. Lorna was like a mother to her, and I was, eh,‚Äù Lilia hesitated, ‚Äúan older figure.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia still felt guilty all these decades later. She had helped shape this woman, took all of Agatha‚Äôs love and trust, and thrown it away and destroyed it. Destroyed Agatha. Lorna had once called her Lilia ‚ÄòThe destroyer of all that is well and good in this world‚Äô Calderu during an argument. Lilia turned around and called her Lorna ‚ÄòMother to all but her own child‚Äô Wu. It was one of their nastier fights near the end of their friendship.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLorna was a mother to Agatha, but not Alice,‚Äù Rio said slowly, trying to make it make sense. Alice had yearned for more of a relationship with her mother, but understood, at least when older, that her time with Norma had been better for her. Alice was so well-adjusted and had a happy, loving childhood,¬† raised by Gran. Alice and Agatha were pretty close these days, and Alice was so happy for Rio. Alice had even encouraged Rio‚Äôs relationship with Agatha. Did she know the dynamics of Agatha and Lorna‚Äôs relationship? How much of any of this did Alice know? Had ALICE, her chosen sister, been lying to her? Rio pushed that thought aside, one potential traitor at a time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLorna had chosen a different life for Alice after seeing how growing up here had affected Agatha. She knew that her hopes for Alice‚Äôs life and future were incompatible with the celebrity lives they led; sex, drugs, and alcohol.¬† As she must have told you, Agatha was an alcoholic before she was in double digits, as were most Hollywood kids back then. And, Lorna, well, you know her story.‚Äù Lilia waved her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha was an alcoholic? I knew she partied. I didn‚Äôt know she was an alcoholic. She still drinks now, should she not?‚Äù Rio was mildly irritated that her concern for Agatha was eroding at the anger that was fueling her conversation. Lilia nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFrom the time she was a kid until she was thirty-two. She quit when she started her fertility journey. I didn‚Äôt know immediately, having pushed her away as much as I could, showing her a colder vision of myself. Let‚Äôs go back‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The truth hurts, Lilia reminded herself, even to the person saying it. Yet, this was a necessary hurt today. Rio‚Äôs main concern was evident. She needed honesty after months of being lied to. Anything less would remove any chance Lilia had of staying in Rio‚Äôs good graces. And, if Lilia had any chance of returning to Agatha‚Äôs life, she had to be honest with Rio. Lilia had to overcome the survival instinct to battle what she imagined was Agatha‚Äôs narrative of the story, that of Lilia the cold-hearted villain. If Lilia wanted to manipulate this to her advantage at all, this would be the way, by not omitting anything or attempting to portray herself in a positive light.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia let the story escape, a torrent held by an age-old dam. Nothing was held back anymore. She told Rio everything, how Agatha had kissed her on her eighteenth birthday, the conversation about Agatha‚Äôs feelings, and how they decided to be casual. She told Rio about how she separated herself into two personas to keep Agatha at arm‚Äôs length. Lilia added Lorna‚Äôs take on it too, her insistence that Lilia was in the wrong and the fights it caused between the best friends.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Unable to stop the truth, Lilia talked about how the dynamic shifted after Nicky was born. Although it had been clear that there were no second chances, she continued the cruel demeanor to focus Agatha away from her. After all, she was, wasn‚Äôt she?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs where we are today,‚Äù Lilia finished, eyes puffy from crying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio ran a hand over her face. Thoughts fluttered around her brain, making it difficult to pin one down for long. But her emotions stayed strong. Rio was livid and conflicted. Her heart ached for Agatha and Lilia in completely different ways. It made her want to stay and comfort or run far away.¬† These situations were just so fucking convoluted. One thing was clear to her. She couldn‚Äôt imagine losing Alice because one of them had made such a stupid life choice. To endure this crazy life and do so alone and without forgiveness and closure from your best friend. It was heartbreaking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This whole thing was messy. It was complicated. It was a psychological drama Rio wasn‚Äôt sure she wanted to play a part in anymore. Still, Rio was never one to stand down when justice needed to be done.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat the fuck, Lilia? There is so much to unpack here. I don‚Äôt know where to start.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGive it a shot,‚Äù Lilia said with tired cynicism, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard or thought it all.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha trusted you! You were supposed to be a safe person for her! You were one of two people that she had in this world and you didn‚Äôt just fuck her over, you actually fucked her. You KNEW better, Lilia! So WHAT if she was a consenting adult, or mature? She was still a kid compared to you, Lilia. One of your two best friends! Lorna was a much better woman than I am.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio paced the room, fists clenched. Yes, it took two people to get into the situation, but Agatha had been young, and it had been Lilia‚Äôs job, no, her duty, to shut the whole thing down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLorna was a better woman than all of us,‚Äù Lilia corrected. ‚ÄúI regret what I did to Agatha and how. I took a moment of weakness and stretched it for a decade. I destroyed myself, Agatha, and the family we built in the process. Each one of us had a vice, and somehow, mine turned out to be the most damaging. I suspected from the beginning I wasn‚Äôt the person for Agatha, but I selfishly thought maybe it could work out. I deluded myself that I was balancing it well, jumping between two personalities with her, warmly loving and coldly distant.¬† It didn‚Äôt work as well as I had thought, and Agatha had cried, god, I don‚Äôt know how many times to Lorna, who affectionately called me a ‚Äòbipolar bitch.‚Äô It wasn‚Äôt just a bad situation, it was a disaster, and I was too blind to see it or what it did to me. I completely lost sight of who I was, and every word said under that other version of me made me hate myself, too. I‚Äôve never been able to forgive myself.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia looked down at the floor, her eyes following patterns in the wood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat about Nicky? You didn‚Äôt want him, so why bother treating him with such favoritism?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had stopped pacing for a moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a part of Agatha, and that makes him special. Just as Agatha will always be special to me, I will always love her, Rio. Not the way you do, no, but the way I have always loved her,‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio jumped in, ‚ÄúThe way you always loved her? Like you still want to sleep with her?‚Äù Rio‚Äôs face was one of utter disgust.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia‚Äôs face did not change. ‚ÄúNo, Rio, I do not want to sleep with Agatha, that is not a part of it. As I was saying, I also care about all our students. But I will go further to protect Nicky and the twins out of loyalty to Agatha, Wanda, and, most importantly, Lorna.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWANDA!‚Äù Rio remembered the good-hearted redhead with an inability to keep secrets, realization dawning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe must not know any of this! Does she even know what truly happened to Lorna?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI doubt it. One great thing Agatha picked up from Lorna is a protective streak. With that, and Agatha‚Äôs maturity beyond her years, she sheltered Wanda from all that she could.¬† Agatha swooped in and has always tried to take away Wanda‚Äôs pain from the atrocities of genocidal war and then an exploitative family member. Agatha immediately got Wanda into therapy once she got Wanda away from her aunt. If Wanda will ever tell you about those first few weeks at Agatha‚Äôs, let her. It will give you more insight into Wanda and why she has let Agatha lead and guide her for so long. But I digress.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia finished the now cold tea as she tried to remember where she was going with that last story and looked at Rio. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre conflicted.‚Äù She stated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo shit,‚Äù Rio replied. ‚ÄúOn the one hand, the ex Agatha told me about is this awful, terrible, cold, and unfeeling woman‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe was,‚Äù Lilia confirmed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs face twisted as she looked at Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBut, you‚Äôre not. You‚Äôre Lilia. You care about these kids, especially the boys. You hate injustice, you get nervous over a teacher going into labor, and you worry about students getting glitter in their eyes. You want what‚Äôs best for former friends, you give women second chances, and you watch over your former best friend's daughter. Alice told me about the advice you gave her about Jen. You warned me about keeping Wanda‚Äôs secrets. The Lilia Calderu I know, cryptic and shady though she may be, is not the woman of Agatha‚Äôs past.‚Äù Rio didn‚Äôt know what to do or really what to think, about anyone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of shady characters around here, my dear.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou and Agatha, primarily,‚Äù Rio said, looking at the floor as she had a thought. ‚ÄúLilia, why did you bring me here? Don‚Äôt give me the bullshit about teaching or because of Alice, why did you really bring me here?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew the answer but needed to hear it straight from the source.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDo not discount my support for Alice and her moment of need. But, yes, I also saw two broken women who could support each other. With what I knew of that little wild coven, it would be inevitable if you came back with us.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia waited for Rio‚Äôs reaction, knowing it could go a myriad of ways, really hoping anger wasn‚Äôt the one Rio chose, but knowing too well that her cards were upside down at this point.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chose anger.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWHAT?! You tried to set us up?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo. Words have meaning, my dear. I said you could support each other. I didn‚Äôt expect all of this to happen, though part of me always hopes for the best for Agatha, in love as well. I only want her to be happy and for Nicky to be surrounded by love. Everything else? All of that was more than I could hope for, but I would do it over and over if I knew the results would be the same.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      All Rio heard was how Lilia had set them up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou KNEW I had a stalker, and you put them in harm's way to make up for the pain you caused her? That‚Äôs selfish, Lilia!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was moving faster now, careful not to trip over her own two feet as she wore a path in the wooden flooring. Lilia‚Äôs eyes followed Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, a stalker. Not a crazy, psychopath who would follow you across the state! I didn‚Äôt know Lou would completely lose it, and neither did you. I certainly didn‚Äôt know she‚Äôd go after Nicky. I would have never let it get that far.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt at the hospital when he got injured,‚Äù Rio spat out the accusation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot that you were aware of, sure. I told Wanda not to wake either of you or tell you I was there. Anytime Nicky or the twins hurt themselves, I am in the shadows. Don‚Äôt underestimate me, Vidal. You‚Äôre losing focus.‚Äù Lilia reminded her with a slight smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis is too much,‚Äù Rio shook her head. ‚ÄúYou were a monster and shattered her. Now,¬† you‚Äôre what, trying to redeem yourself? You bring me here, effectively putting her in danger, Agatha and I fall in love, what do you get? Absolution of your sins?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs mind was reeling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMy sins are my own, and I have to live with those, with what I did and what my actions caused. I lost my family because of what I did, Rio. All the money and notoriety in the world can‚Äôt replace that, and it was a hard lesson to learn. I went from being a planet in someone‚Äôs solar system to a monster lurking in the shadows.‚Äù Lilia was willing Rio to understand, without a side of anger.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had stopped making her laps in Lilia‚Äôs front room. It was late, and her energy was fading. ‚ÄúSo this was your idea to what, to return to dwarf planet status, Pluto?‚Äù Rio had her hands on her hips, her hard expression returning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia finally stood, walking back to the kitchen to put away the now empty teacup‚Äîmore to keep herself busy than anything else. Rio was shaking, though she wasn‚Äôt sure whether it was from convoluted emotions, adrenaline, or shock.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIs this your entire redemption arc, Lilia? Restore love to Agatha‚Äôs life and maybe, just maybe, find your way back in, because I may not allow that to happen, purely out of protection. What if I don‚Äôt trust you anymore?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia scoffed, rinsing the cup and placing it on the drainboard, turning to face Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a malicious bone in your body. Norma raised you better. It‚Äôs why Lou is still breathing and why I‚Äôm still standing. If Agatha didn‚Äôt want me here, I wouldn‚Äôt be, and you won‚Äôt go against Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou also won‚Äôt hurt Alice, and
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       she
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      still sees the good in me. Alice is the one who called me to you, in case you‚Äôve forgotten. She is the one that gave me the idea to bring you here, and it‚Äôs already crossed your mind how much she‚Äôs withheld.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio quickly looked away. Lilia was, after all, the master at reading people.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDid my career amount to anything in your principal Calderu eyes? Or was it merely my trauma and relationship with Alice?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was floundering.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course it did. I wasn‚Äôt letting an unqualified teacher around my kids. I may be kooky, Rio, but I‚Äôm not certifiable. I do have some standards.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For the first time during their conversation, Lilia felt slightly offended. Rio shook her head, walking back through the living room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis conversation isn‚Äôt over, Lilia. I don‚Äôt know what to think. I don‚Äôt know who you are anymore. I‚Äôm confused about my feelings. I have no idea what‚Äôs real and what was manipulated. I need the week, Lilia, I won‚Äôt be in.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio headed for the door as Lilia caught her arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, wait, just hang on for a minute.‚Äù Lilia dropped her hand and went to where keys were hanging by the door, taking one on a triple moon keyring and writing down an address in the Sierra Nevada region.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGo home, get some sleep, drive up in the morning. It‚Äôs a good place to do some thinking. Lorna and Agatha did a lot of‚Ä¶retreats there. I know things aren‚Äôt okay, and I know they aren‚Äôt okay with us. I‚Äôll take care of work, and you go clear your head. As for Agatha, a couple of things. Her drinking is under control, and she has a small Army of friends to pull her away from most bad situations. But, lastly, and most importantly, I can bring people together Rio, but I can‚Äôt make them fall in love. You have every right to be mad at me, and if you burn down the cabin, I deserve it. But don‚Äôt take it out on Agatha, don‚Äôt shut her out, and don‚Äôt cause her pain like I did.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For the first time, Lilia actually looked her age, and older.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo one is even slightly capable of doing what you did, Swords,‚Äù Rio retorted as she took the key and address and closed the door firmly behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had gone in, guns a-blazin‚Äô, and came out surrounded by ghosts. Calling Lilia Swords was what Rio had needed to remind her that this woman had hurt Agatha all those years ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia could only smirk at the nickname as she watched Rio through the glass in the door. Confirming the rumor of the tattoo and recalling something Lorna had once said before
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Witches‚Äô Road
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      had even been written.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not taking a knife to her heart, Lilia, you‚Äôre taking a sword to it.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
<span>

<p>

     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was after midnight when Rio entered her apartment and turned on the light. Her eyes automatically landed on the flowers on the coffee table and the opened spiral. She picked it up and sat on the couch, reading the note from Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       My Love,
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I came by to bring you soup and other supplies. Everything is in the fridge. Raven led me to this.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Yes, Lilia is my ex. Please give me a chance to explain after you hear her side of the story. I love you so much, and I do not want to lose you. I know you have your reasons for not telling me you were going to see her, and I respect that. I am here to answer any and all questions you have when you‚Äôre ready.
      </span>

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I love you.
      </span>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had even left her boutonniere from the reception lying next to the letter. Rio put her head in her hands and sobbed. When she finally stopped, she dragged herself to the shower, sitting on the floor as the hot water washed away her tears and thinking about her next move. She had a lot to process, and thanks to Lilia, the root cause of most of this, she had a fortress of solitude awaiting her escape. Still, her thoughts scattered like the water around her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She needed Alice, but she couldn‚Äôt ruin this time for her and Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice might also have been keeping secrets all these years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hadn‚Äôt felt this alone since before she had crossed foot into Norma Wu‚Äôs house. Even on her own in San Francisco, she could call Alice and talk to her. Meet up on the weekends.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Oh, Wanda. Poor Wanda, too. Someone else who would just be crushed. She would have to wait for Wanda to reach out to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio lay in her bed, having transitioned from her shower to the comfort of her blankets, and emotional support Raven curled on her stomach as she let out a harsh laugh. This damn situation was so convoluted because Agatha was at the center of this little lesbian universe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, she would do as Lilia had instructed, wouldn‚Äôt she? Get some sleep, because deep down, Rio knew it was the best thing to do. Not because Lilia had suggested it but because it was the smart thing to do.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She would pack, leave a note for Alice to take Raven to Nicky, and flee to the cabin in the mountains.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maybe she would burn it down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After all, she did feel like causing some damage.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLilia. It was Lilia?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda‚Äôs face drained of color, a feat for the already fair-skinned redhead. Then, it contorted to hurt as the realization of the past nearly thirty years crept in. Lilia and Lorna had been such a force, their friendship stood solid through everything, and they had been there through everything. Lilia had always been there for them, and then suddenly, she hadn‚Äôt been there as much. Then, she had more to do with Wanda, and by extension, Nat. Not as much with Agatha. Wanda hadn‚Äôt known what had happened. All she remembered from those years was the inherent sadness that never left Lorna‚Äôs eyes and how her emotions flared and tears flowed if anyone even mentioned Lilia.¬† Her heart ached for their friendship, derailed by horrid decisions and poor life choices. Wanda couldn‚Äôt imagine losing Agatha‚Äôs presence like that, and the mere thought made her eyes well up with tears once more. Lilia had brought Wanda so much hope when she came to visit the hospital on the day of Nicky‚Äôs birth, thinking things would be all right again, but nothing came of it. Which again sent a wave of sadness over her now as it had years ago. Wanda knew Lilia would have been over the moon for Lorna‚Äôs sobriety had she been made aware.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had all been so proud of Lorna.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then she and Agatha did that movie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lorna relapsed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lorna died.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The memory of the days surrounding her death made her eyes sting again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They all moved on, honoring Lorna with the best lives they could lead and raising their sons in a happy and stable home. Then, it came time to send the boys to school, and Agatha insisted on SHIELD. Wanda was elated to have Lilia back, if even on the periphery of their small family. That‚Äôs when she could see Agatha and Lilia's relationship begin to thaw slowly.¬† It was one of the reasons Wanda was so insistent on becoming the ultimate school moms. The parties, the functions, everything. She so badly wanted to rebuild their group‚Äôs old dynamic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn‚Äôt just for Agatha, who would never admit to needing Lilia around. Wanda had needed Lilia back in almost the same way that Lilia needed them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda turned to Nat, not quite looking at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve kept secrets for Agatha, did you know?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, this is one she didn‚Äôt let me in on either.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked up at Agatha, eyes searching.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey were our friends too. Missed holidays, birthdays, and milestones. It was our family. Agatha, you had no right to decide for us.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded, something darker rolling across her face and into her tremulous voice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI get wanting to have secrets, but why didn‚Äôt you tell me? Me, Aggie. I told you everything, every time. I thought it was mutual. You‚Äôre my sister, for god's sake! You know what I mean. And it isn‚Äôt just one secret now like you always said. Not just the identity of your ex. But, also the two biggest losses and moments in your life before Nicky and I never knew a thing. I didn‚Äôt even suspect something was wrong. Why didn‚Äôt you trust me with these and let me be there for you? Pregnancy, miscarriage, stood up at the altar‚Ä¶ what the hell, Aggie!‚Äù The words tumbled out of her. Wanda felt as though she had been stabbed in the back repeatedly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at Wanda with the same sisterly look as always, ‚ÄúYou were filming overseas, I wasn‚Äôt going to burden you, I -‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù Wanda shouted and jumped up, startling both of the other women. ‚ÄúNO! You don‚Äôt get to do that. I wasn‚Äôt a little girl, Agatha! I wasn‚Äôt then, and I‚Äôm not now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBut, Agatha, I so badly wanted and still want to be there for you, for everything. I was honored to be in that delivery room the day Nicky was born. I gladly would have let you break my hand that day. Every scandal when I got to be there by your side and handle something the way you taught me to was when I finally got to be the person that Agatha Harkness was for me. Now, I find out that you kept two of your darkest moments from me? So I was not able to be there as I should have been and so wished to be. Aggie, I am just devastated.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tears were dripping from Wanda‚Äôs chin and jaw. Nat sat beside her on the couch, also crying, but holding Wanda‚Äôs hand. She looked up at Wanda, nodding in agreement and resisting the urge to put her arms around Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wiped her face with the sleeve of her shirt, which was covered in tears and snot, despite having changed just a little while earlier.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to cloud your judgment now by telling you who, and back then, I didn‚Äôt want to bother you with everything you had -‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This time, it was Nat who interrupted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt an excuse to use, Agatha. We all knew what we were doing, and Wanda did a damn good job at balancing us with everything else.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI would‚Äôve been back here immediately. Lilia being your ex doesn‚Äôt cloud my judgment now, and it wouldn‚Äôt have then. This was something you did for you, not us. I am capable of talking to someone and separating their past indiscretions. You wanted to maintain control and the facade of your life. We can call it a lesson you picked up in your youth. But, that control would have cracked had you tried to reconcile the truth with the facade you presented. Yes, it was complicated, but Lilia was a big part of all our lives. And whether you want to admit it or not, you needed her back in your life when Lorna died. You chose to go through so much on your own when you had me, us, and probably her too.‚Äù Wanda gestured. ‚ÄúAll you had to do was tell us.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took a moment to breathe. Her words marinated in Agatha‚Äôs head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio is good for you, the best really. But, it‚Äôs not all about having a perfect partner.‚Äù Wanda looked at her hand in Nat‚Äôs before reaching out with the other to Agatha. ‚ÄúYou also need the old Lilia to fill a different role. Stop thinking of her as your ex. That woman is long gone, and you know deep down that she is.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha did not reach for Wanda‚Äôs outstretched hand, unconsciously taking a step back instead and causing another wave of sorrow to hit Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, God! I‚Äôm so over the manipulations and the betrayal! Nearly THIRTY years of it. How can I trust you, that this is all of it, that you‚Äôre not holding back anything else important?‚Äù Wanda looked away from Agatha, her bottom lip quivering.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was never supposed to be the one being betrayed, Agatha.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned forward, her head dropping. She knew that the hardest challenge still lay ahead, and she dreaded having to add salt to Wanda‚Äôs emotional wounds tonight. She hated the feeling of causing pain to the person she swore to protect.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Yet, Agatha still had to tell her how Lorna died. Not the fabricated story that she had reiterated so many times over the years it almost felt like a truth of its own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was also the letter Lorna had written for Wanda, too. Agatha had never given it to her, not because she didn‚Äôt want to, but because it had specific instructions:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       When Wanda and Nat get married.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Or 15 years from now (2/27/26),
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       whichever comes first.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
      She assumed that Lorna had written it in that letter. Lorna had a flair for the dramatic, but no, she needed to tell Wanda now, before she did any more damage.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, Wanda. There‚Äôs more I need to tell you. But this one was not exactly my secret.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She raised her eyes to meet Wanda‚Äôs scrutinizing gaze, knowing this was going to deal a harsh blow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou might want to sit down.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda didn‚Äôt sit down. Instead, she remained standing, knowing she might end up bolting out of the door and sprinting across the compound. Nat stood, taking up a protective stance next to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha blinked back tears and drew a shaky breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPlease know that Lorna didn‚Äôt want anyone to know, but she never relapsed. She remained sober.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The confusion instantly hit both redheads.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen what happened? Agatha, we know what substance abuse looks like. Lorna looked so bad at the end. She looked‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It clicked for both of them at that moment as she looked at Nat. Where Nat accepted it with a silent nod, Wanda let out an ear-splitting scream.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNO! She was clean, she was sober, she was vibrant! WHY?! Why did this happen to her? Why didn‚Äôt you tell us?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda wasn‚Äôt really standing as much as Nat was holding her up as she relived that night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLorna didn‚Äôt want anyone to pity her, didn‚Äôt want to become some sob story or martyr. She was down to the last few weeks, days really. And, went out on her own terms at that party we were all at, and you know the rest.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had relived the memory so many times over the years. It was a piece of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda clung to Nat as she let the initial shock subside and stood straight. There was time for rehashed grief later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIn hiding all of this, you did more damage than good. Once more your secrets and manipulations hurt us all. We deserved to be there for Lorna and for you. We deserved to mourn and honor her.¬† Lilia isn‚Äôt the only one that‚Äôs been playing two different people, Agatha. She may have started the demolition, but you kept it going.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She motioned to Nat for them to go as she looked back at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have to think some things over. You know we‚Äôll be okay in a few days because that‚Äôs what family does, Agatha. They forgive each other, no matter the transgressions or duration. Ironically, it was you and Lorna who taught me that. Just give me some space to process this.‚Äù She paused a moment. ‚ÄúI just hope Rio can forgive you. If Alice knew ANY of this and didn‚Äôt tell Rio, then may God have mercy on her soul.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Hand-in-hand, Nat and Wanda walked out of Agatha‚Äôs house. Wanda would absolutely forgive Agatha in a few days. She wouldn‚Äôt let this come between them. There would be scars, but she saw how haunted Lilia still was to this day, and she would not make those same mistakes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the hurt redheads returned to their house, Wanda turned to Nat as they buried themselves in each other‚Äôs arms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow do you manage to remain so stoic and not completely lose it?‚Äù Wanda sniffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSome training never leaves you, but also, I had a hand in Lorna‚Äôs death,‚Äù Nat whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda pulled back and looked up at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat? But she chose that herself, you had nothing to do with that unless you gave her the‚Ä¶‚Äù Wanda looked at her in horror and stepped back. Nat ran a hand through her hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt give her anything! She came to me asking about certain pills and medications. I assumed it was for a role, and I answered her. Just like I would you. I gave her the names of some people from whom she could get more information. She asked me if I used to carry things on me, and I told her I still did for‚Ä¶trickier situations I occasionally find myself in involving you two. Stalkers, if anyone is ever kidnapped, any possible revenge; you know, the shadier side.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha Harkness was not your normal, run-of-the-mill celebrity.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded, not liking where this was going. Nat crossed her arms, tears gathering at the rims of her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI did not tell her where I kept anything; she was clever,‚Äù Nat smiled. ‚Äú It was Lorna, she had known me for fourteen years and had a hand in forming me. She knew how to get into my house. She knew all my secret hiding places, the secret panels. A few days after she died, I had a suspicion, and I checked. It was all missing, with a note that said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so sorry, you‚Äôll learn why one day. I love you, Nat. Take good care of them, especially Wanda.‚Äô‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The tears had spilled over as she looked at Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am so sorry, Wanda.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The sleeves of Wanda‚Äôs shirt were permanently tear-stained, she was sure. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat couldn‚Äôt meet her eyes. ‚ÄúTo protect you,‚Äù she whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was done.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am NOT a child that needs protecting! I wasn‚Äôt then, and I‚Äôm not now! You‚Äôre sleeping on the couch.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned on her heel and stomped up the stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had just stood and stared after Wanda and Nat. Her hands had dropped to her sides, and she truly did not know what to do with herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was losing people quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her phone dinged, Nat had installed the tracking app for the necklace. Rio had just left Lilia‚Äôs. Agatha huffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAlright, you old bat, time for us to do this,‚Äù she said aloud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She swore she heard Lorna‚Äôs laughter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sailed into Lilia‚Äôs house as though she belonged there, locking the door behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI see you were expecting me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha noticed a mug of black coffee on the coffee table as she settled in the old armchair beside it, the one that had always been her favorite. It was still just as comfortable.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou should keep the door locked. You never know what shady characters will come in, present company excluded, of course.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked down at the wooden floor and noticed a burn mark, a memory of a time she had missed the ashtray. Lilia walked in from the kitchen with a new cup of tea.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs two in the morning, and you‚Äôre the second dark-haired lesbian in my house tonight. I think I‚Äôll take my chances.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI take it things didn‚Äôt go well,‚Äù Agatha concluded, pushing away the memories of her time spent here. In the past, the two women had at least kept their activities relegated to different spaces. This house held the better memories - the memories of family. There were arguments, especially near the end, sure. However, this house mostly reminded Agatha of who and what she lost and she realized she was losing her anger quickly, even though she was trying to hold on to it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alive, so it could have been much worse. Have you heard from her?‚Äù Lilia quirked a brow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, and I don‚Äôt think I will for at least a day or so. She lied to me about coming here. She told me she was at her apartment while I was physically standing there, so that‚Äôs where we are with that. Did you orchestrate this? Don‚Äôt tell me you didn‚Äôt. You know better than to meddle in the affairs of a Harkness.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could have sworn she saw ghosts of their younger selves everywhere. Agatha had crossed her legs at the knees and held her mug at her lips. Lilia sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou and I both know that I am not the woman I was all those years before.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia‚Äôs eyes met Agatha‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMaybe not completely, but there‚Äôs still that Calderu manipulation there. That was always a staple. Half-truths, cryptic advice, the ultimate mastermind.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took a sip of her coffee, her gaze steady.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, and you are my protege, don‚Äôt forget that,‚Äù Lilia reminded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked away at that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe question still stands,‚Äù Agatha replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI brought her here because she would be a great fit at SHIELD, Alice needed her, and she would also fill gaping wounds.‚Äù Lilia studied Agatha‚Äôs reaction carefully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFifty-one, and you‚Äôre still trying to control my life,‚Äù Agatha barked, though they both knew there was no real bite to it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI just want what‚Äôs best for you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The anger in Agatha attempted to shove forward with that admission. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs best for me? WHAT‚ÄôS BEST FOR ME?! Was staring at me for three hours after I told you I miscarried, what was best for me? Was leaving me at the altar what was best for me? Was using me for ten years? Don‚Äôt tell me what‚Äôs best for me, Lilia. Actually, it‚Äôs about time we have this heart-to-heart, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia settled into the sofa, her face soft after the wave of verbal blows from Agatha. Agatha paused, chest heaving after her release.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt process it, Agatha.‚Äù Lilia began. ‚ÄúThere was so much going on with me and in my head. I had lost my ability to have children and had barely worked through that. I was so concerned and worried for you and your future. I knew you needed comfort, and at the same time, not from me. Yet, I mourned for you inwardly. As cold as I was to you, I felt it all rage within me. I had compartmentalized completely until I disassociated from everything and everyone. The two people I had become warred with one another, as was so frequent for me then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMy first instinct was to hold you, Agatha. It always was. The night you told me you were in love with me? I wanted to console you, kiss you, hold you. All of the times that widened the gap between us? I never wanted to cause the divide to begin with, but I knew I wasn‚Äôt that person for you either, Agatha. I could have tried, but it would have ended with even less chance of any reconciliation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt let you end your career, Agatha. Not when you sacrificed so much and worked so hard, look at all the good you‚Äôve done! We both know that neither of us would have been happy, and I never meant to use you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had expected a verbal fistfight. She didn‚Äôt expect Lilia to roll over this easily, and she certainly didn‚Äôt expect the venom to be drained from her own proverbial fangs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked at Lilia, skeptically. This had to be a ruse of some type. A power play or manipulation. This was not the ruthless Don Calderu she had known. Yet, the realization of the truth also stung.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYour first instinctual reaction to me confessing my love for you was to console me?‚Äù Agatha shook her head, scoffing aloud. ‚ÄúI guess I never really understood our dynamic and you are one fucked up lady.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The shock on Lilia‚Äôs face and the reversal of the conversation energized Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo, what then? Why are you confessing everything now? Not even arguing or defending yourself? This is not like you.‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs arms were crossed tightly against her chest as she scrutinized Lilia‚Äôs every movement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia placed her tea on the table next to a scratch caused by a glass pipe long ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLorna was my friend too,‚Äù She said softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt as though Lilia had screamed it. Again, she felt that age-old hurt of coming second to Lorna in Lilia‚Äôs eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLorna told me for ten years to end it, that I was breaking you, little by little, yet I kept on. Kept convincing myself that you were an adult, kept trying to prove to her that I wasn‚Äôt wrong. I was technically correct, but I still should have ended it or never let it begin in the first place. You were my vice, and I became the worst of the three of us. You and Lorna stayed true to who you were. In the end, I left you, unrecognizable, and I lost my best friends and my family, in the process.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia‚Äôs face showed the worry of someone who had experienced great loss. Not the carefully constructed mask she had worn for so long.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI should have been there with you, Aggi...Agatha.‚Äù She stopped herself from using the nickname Lorna had given Agatha all those lifetimes ago. ‚ÄúI should have been there the whole time, the treatments, the appointments, at the end. Supporting you. I know you didn‚Äôt tell Wanda, she and Nat were one of the worst-kept secrets in Hollywood, and she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to keep Lorna‚Äôs secret. You did it all alone, and you shouldn‚Äôt have had to.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had moved to be closer to Agatha and tentatively put a hand on Agatha‚Äôs knee. Agatha stared at Lilia‚Äôs hand, which she had known so well, that had brought her comfort and pleasure and was now offering comfort again. It was also offering a bridge back to something more familiar.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha covered Lilia‚Äôs hand with hers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI told Wanda everything tonight.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She spoke around the lump in her throat. She had wanted to say other things, lash out at Lilia for not being there, and continue to shift the blame. She couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. Lilia‚Äôs honesty had disarmed her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Manipulative bitch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, Agatha, how did she take it?‚Äù Lilia asked. Her voice was that of the caring, loving Lilia from long ago. The Lilia that Agatha had so desperately needed since Lorna died.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot well,‚Äù Agatha sniffed. ‚ÄúShe said that I also turned into two people, and she‚Äôs right. I betrayed the person I swore to protect,‚Äù Realization dawned on Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh my gods, Lilia. I didn't screw her, but I sure as hell screwed her over‚Ä¶fuck,‚Äù Agatha was going over everything in her mind. She
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       was
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      two different people, and in some of the same ways, she had done to Wanda what Lilia had done to her. ‚ÄúI kept telling myself that it wasn‚Äôt my secret to tell. Lorna left a letter for her to open when she and Nat either got married or fifteen years later. I told myself I was protecting her.‚Äù Agatha looked at Lilia with tired, watery eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAh yes, Lorna‚Äôs letters. I received an envelope of them in the mail the day after she died. I told myself I was trying to protect you and keep our friendship intact. As you can see, it did not work. As for Wanda, she isn‚Äôt that scared little girl anymore.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly what she said, and then I covered a secret for Nat, so that‚Äôs going to make things worse, and there‚Äôs still Rio. She hates me, doesn‚Äôt she? I‚Äôve lost my sister, two of them really, and the love of my life because I don‚Äôt know how to tell the truth, and I wish I could blame you, but I can‚Äôt.‚Äù Agatha saw Lilia in a different light.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      If Agatha keeping secrets from Wanda did major damage, wouldn‚Äôt she do whatever it took to stay in Wanda‚Äôs life? To repair things between Wanda and Nat? The things Nat had were for one specific purpose and didn‚Äôt count as drugs in her eyes. Nat had zero ill intentions and never suspected that Lorna would do what she did. She had come to Agatha as soon as she had discovered them missing, and Agatha had been the one to tell her not to tell Wanda. She would shoulder all the blame for it if she needed to. They had finally gotten engaged. They were finally getting married. Agatha wouldn‚Äôt let anything come in between that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Isn‚Äôt that what Lorna and Lilia had always done?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia would always be there for the boys, Agatha, Wanda, and Nat, if they ever needed her. And Agatha had been playing the Lilia card all year to get Rio, and occasionally Alice, out of work, hadn‚Äôt she?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had shed the Swords persona long ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had developed one of her own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Now, Agatha was paying for it, and she had blamed Lilia for it this whole time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have to talk to Rio.‚Äù Agatha stood up abruptly and lost her balance. Lilia pulled her back down to sit before she fell over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo. I gave her the key to the cabin so I could keep an eye on her and know where to send you. She‚Äôs going to find out that Alice knew, and her heart will absolutely shatter. I also knew you would come clean with Wanda soon, and she would turn to Rio. Wanda will probably go with her if she catches her early enough. You and Nat can head up in a day or so. I‚Äôll give Alice time off when she needs it. You should probably make sure Jen and Vision are ready to be on kid duty.‚Äù Lilia laid it all out, the mastermind at work.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOur family has everything, doesn‚Äôt it? Drama, generational trauma, so many lesbians‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha was trying to make jokes like she always did, but her heart wasn‚Äôt in it. ‚ÄúAm I going to lose her?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia thought about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot if you‚Äôre honest, and I do mean completely. If I can learn how to tell the truth, you can too.‚Äù Lilia leaned in and patted her shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled and gave a small laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know that‚Äôs a manipulation technique, Lils. I am, after all, the Luke to your Yoda.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia‚Äôs heart stopped at the old nickname as she stared at Agatha, who had looked away when she realized what she had said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make a big deal out of it, okay?‚Äù She scoffed, looking back at the other woman.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSays the woman who expressly put nicknames off limits.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDo you blame me? I was still hurt, and I still am, but things have been somewhat repaired, and Rio has been integral to that. I cannot lose her, Lilia,‚Äù she reiterated. ‚ÄúI know that now. How long do I give it?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking at me now? For relationship advice?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI mean, you‚Äôve done pretty well so far‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha smiled at the absurdity of it all.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know. Don‚Äôt make the same mistakes I did, okay, kid?‚Äù Lilia squeezed Agatha‚Äôs hand. Both of them had done entirely too much crying tonight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before Agatha could overthink it, she moved from the armchair to Lilia‚Äôs side, wrapping her arms around her, and cried on her shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were sixteen and thirty again, the self-inflicted orphan and the gay aunt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had memorized the letters Lorna had written to her. She hadn‚Äôt opened them all, as some had explicit instructions. But the one she had opened on her fifty-first birthday nearly a year ago when she turned the same age Lorna had been when she had died was explicit:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Aggie,
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I know you‚Äôre freaking out this year because it‚Äôs the age I died at. If you have yet¬† to forgive Lilia, it‚Äôs time. You know you need her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Make your family complete again, Agatha.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Even dead, I know you.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I love you, Sweetie,
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Lorna
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       P.S. I really hope you‚Äôve found love by now. You‚Äôre not broken, just bent.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda hadn‚Äôt slept well. How could she? She knew Nat had left, either to the Clubhouse, Agatha‚Äôs, The Beachhouse, hell, maybe even Tahoe. At that moment, she didn‚Äôt care that much. She had never been this upset with Natasha. To sit on a secret for thirteen years, and one this big? How dare she! Nat had never kept something like this from her, and she certainly had never told anything more than a white lie to Wanda. Something like ‚Äòof course it tastes fine burnt, sunshine.‚Äô Wanda couldn‚Äôt imagine staying there right now, and she knew one person she could talk to about all of this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had also been hurt, albeit much worse, by Agatha. Wanda still didn‚Äôt know how much Alice knew and preemptively hurt for Rio in that regard. She needed to talk to Rio, and going to her apartment sounded like a good idea.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Me:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha lied to me too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So did Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I can‚Äôt stay here.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Can I come over?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda didn‚Äôt know why she was nervous while she waited for a response.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Rio:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I talked to Lilia last night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I assume that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      referring to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia gave me the keys to a cabin
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      in the mountains. Do you want
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      to come?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      We can be miserable together?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thought it would be nice to have another person with her, someone to talk everything out with. Someone Agatha had also betrayed. She couldn‚Äôt imagine how Wanda felt. Probably the same way she was going to feel once she talked to Alice and confirmed her suspicions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Me:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I haven‚Äôt been there in
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      quite some time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I‚Äôll take you up on that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Yes. Meet at your place at ten
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      this morning?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda glanced at the clock. It was seven, and they had plenty of time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded silently to herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Rio:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sounds great.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      See you then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I‚Äôll bring the wine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda quickly sent Vision a message asking if he could take the boys for a few days, and he agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Instead of leaving a note for Nicky on Alice‚Äôs door, Rio texted him about Raven, and he was excited, although a little confused about why he needed to take care of Raven. He would pick her up later that day, probably after Rio and Wanda left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hugged Wanda when she arrived before loading her luggage into the car.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt exactly pack lightly, Maximoff,‚Äù she joked as Wanda smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHave you talked to Alice?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs mouth was a thin line as she shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid to. What if she did know?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda put a hand on her friend‚Äôs shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen we face it together, and I‚Äôm here to get you through it. Let‚Äôs go cry, drink, and potentially cause trouble in the mountains.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was grateful for the other woman in the car. Already her heart felt lighter. Even in what felt like her darkest moments of this year, she had never been alone. The hurt was still there, but the love that surrounded her, here, and she knew, in Agatha‚Äôs heart too, comforted her nonetheless.

      It was Wanda‚Äôs turn to drive as they talked about the revelations of the past eighteen hours and how they were feeling about everything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI feel so stupid, believing I was exempt from Agatha‚Äôs betrayal,‚Äù Wanda began. ‚ÄúI mean, small lies and omissions, sure. Not big things like this, though. Then Nat kept something from me on top of all of it? Nat has NEVER lied to me apart from things like ‚Äòno sunshine, I‚Äôm not getting you anything for your birthday‚Äô, or ‚Äòno honey, I didn‚Äôt eat the last of the ice cream, it was Tommy‚Äô. Tommy doesn‚Äôt even like pistachio ricotta cheesecake ice cream!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was waving wildly with one hand and barely keeping her other on the steering wheel as they headed north.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, welcome to this side of your sister. Sorry, it‚Äôs your first time.‚Äù Rio deadpanned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She felt terrible that Wanda was having to experience it, yet in the short time she had known Agatha, and the even shorter time she had been with her, this seemed to be a reoccurring event, and she hated it. Yes, Rio had kept things from Agatha, but she had made a concerted effort not to do that any longer after the Lou fiasco.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Yes, Rio had slept with a sociopathic jewel thief, thought for a millisecond she was still in love with her, and briefly considered going back before she realized the manipulation techniques‚Äô effects. However, she had made it very clear to both Agatha and Lou that she no longer wanted anything to do with Lou Falco. She very much wanted to see her dead, and Lilia was right when she said Norma had raised her better than that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then there was Agatha. Agatha had slept with Rio‚Äôs boss for a whole decade. Rio didn‚Äôt know her back then, but it still felt strange, especially knowing that Lilia had acted as a puppet master to some extent. To her, it was very much like a sapphic Lifetime movie. She still needed to process and maybe even talk to Lilia more. She especially wanted to hear stories of a young Agatha. If they ever got to a comfortable sharing point, that is.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry she‚Äôs been doing it to you this whole time,‚Äù Wanda was saying as she looked between the road and Rio. ‚ÄúHow long are you going to hold it against her?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Wanda. ‚ÄúHow long are you?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>

<span>
      Nicky had Agatha‚Äôs key to Rio‚Äôs apartment and was opening the door to get Raven as Alice and Jen were leaving theirs. They had another week until they moved onto the compound and were in full-on packing mode. Alice was confused upon seeing Nicky, as he usually didn‚Äôt come over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey, what are you doing over here?‚Äù She asked with a friendly smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHi Alice, hi Jen.‚Äù Nicky smiled back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm keeping Raven this week. Rio‚Äôs going out of town, I think, though I‚Äôm not sure why.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Confusion crossed his face as he hoped these two women would give him answers, though they seemed just as confused as he was. The newlyweds looked at each other, an unasked question passing between them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know she was going anywhere,‚Äù Alice answered, unsure why Rio hadn‚Äôt asked her to keep the centuries-old feline.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha and Wanda have to work this week, and you guys return to school. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù Jen added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky raised his eyebrows in growing concern. ‚ÄúBilly and Tommy are with Uncle Vision this week. Aunt Wanda went with Rio.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat about your mom and Aunt Nat?‚Äù Jen asked, trying to decipher just how difficult her job was about to become.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky shook his head. ‚ÄúAunt Nat left the compound last night. Billy and Tommy think their moms got into an argument, and then mom didn‚Äôt come home until this morning. I think Mom did something stupid again, but my aunts never argue, so it must be really bad, and clearly, they have forgotten their communication techniques.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky bent down to pick up Raven, who had come into the hall to investigate and rubbed her in between the ears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio does stupid things too, Nicky,‚Äù Alice said in defense of Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky put Raven‚Äôs head to his chest and tried to cover both of her ears. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk about her mother like that in front of her,‚Äù he gasped.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen tried to hide her smile. For a kid who wanted nothing to do with acting, he had his mother‚Äôs natural talent.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to call Rio and find out what‚Äôs going on. You take good care of the cat-god there.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice turned on her heel and went back into the apartment, already calling Rio. Jen shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have a feeling my blood pressure is going to be very high this week.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She waved to Nicky and followed her wife back inside. Nicky looked down at Raven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get your stuff packed up, and then you can tell me everything you goddess, you,‚Äù he scratched between her ears as he walked into the house, Raven meowing the whole time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice knew something was horribly wrong. Rio hadn‚Äôt stayed late at the reception yesterday, she hadn‚Äôt even given Alice a goodbye hug or an ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô‚Äîsomething they always did. Yes, Alice and Jen were celebrating their marriage, but Alice would always make time for Rio, no matter what.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She thought Rio felt the same way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That old familiar pang of jealousy slowly crept up on Alice, and she had to bat it away mentally. It was something she had dealt with after her mother had died and the real reason she couldn‚Äôt move out to Los Angeles immediately. She had to work through a lot in therapy before she could be within striking distance of Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Now, as she waited for Rio to pick up, she was reminded that the feeling was reappearing, and once again, Agatha Harkness was responsible. It went to voicemail, and Alice hung up, not leaving one. She looked up at Jen, worried. ‚ÄúMaybe there‚Äôs no service where they‚Äôre at right now?‚Äù Alice looked to Jen for reassurance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course, love, I‚Äôm sure everything is fine.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen took Alice into her arms and held her against her. She didn‚Äôt know what was going on, but her senses told her nothing good. The only person who ever saw this soft side of Jen was Alice, and she would deny she even had one until the day she died.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked at Rio as Rio stared at her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou have to call her back. You know she‚Äôs going to worry, and she doesn‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on. Put it on the Bluetooth.‚Äù The redhead instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio bit the inside of her bottom lip before replying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm right? What if she did know?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen you have to talk through it, Rio. You can‚Äôt just let it fester.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda spoke from recent experience. Rio sighed and called back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice jumped as her phone rang, and she removed herself from her wife‚Äôs arms, answering and putting the call on speaker. She heard the undeniable sounds that signaled car Bluetooth. Wanda was listening.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Alice answered, not sure what she should ask first.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked nervously at Wanda. ‚ÄúHey, sorry, you popped up as a missed call. I guess we were going through a dead spot.‚Äù It was all she could say.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice looked at Jen, clearly confused. This was not like Rio. Alice decided to get straight to the point and sat down, Jen taking her place by her side, running her hand through Alice‚Äôs hair, calming her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe saw Nicky getting Raven. He said you and Wanda are headed up to the mountains. What‚Äôs going on, Ri?‚Äù Alice asked, her voice shaky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio inhaled deeply through her nose and exhaled through her mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWanda and I are heading to a cabin in the mountains so we can do some thinking,‚Äù She said slowly, not sure how much she should say.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice was even more confused. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLast night at the reception, I heard a conversation someone was having and started looking for them. I found out who Agatha‚Äôs ex is, and it‚Äôs Lilia.‚Äù Rio waited for Alice‚Äôs reaction and reply. Just
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       how much had Alice actually known?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice‚Äôs and Jen‚Äôs eyes went wide as they looked at each other. They had their suspicions, but to have it confirmed was something different entirely.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLilia!? Jesus! Well, that at least makes sense now that I think about it. Have you talked to Agatha? Is that why you two are headed to the mountains?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice was starting to get a clearer picture, and she needed to know just how much Rio knew.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWanda did. I talked to Lilia. Alice, I need you to answer me honestly. Me. The person that may have withheld some things from you, but never lied. You always told me that Lorna had relapsed and overdosed. What really happened?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was blinking back tears as Wanda reached over and put a hand on her knee. They would be at the cabin soon and could debrief then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen moved closer to Alice and wrapped an arm around her. She knew that Alice had known quite a bit about Lorna. She also knew that Alice had grown close with Lilia over the past ten years and had flown under the radar. It‚Äôs why they had their suspicions that something had happened between Agatha and Lilia. Alice had shown Jen the letter that Lorna had left her. Alice confided in Jen in a way that she couldn‚Äôt in Rio because Jen had signed the same NDAs, and Alice, the law-abiding citizen that she was, wouldn‚Äôt break that NDA. While Alice could have told Rio about Lorna, she didn‚Äôt want Rio to worry, especially with Alice working at SHIELD.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Now, it was coming back to bite her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Just as Lilia had warned Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice‚Äôs heart squeezed as a tear slid down her cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt sounds like you already know.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio choked back a sob. ‚ÄúHow long have you been keeping it from me?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice leaned into Jen, needing the support. ‚ÄúMom left me a letter and that envelope we kept in your safe. Agatha gave it to me at the funeral, along with Lilia‚Äôs information. I never did open the larger envelope, but I read the letter and called Agatha a few days after the funeral and talked to her. Mom put everything in that letter.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou knew for thirteen, no, fourteen, years, and never told me. Three of those years, you were still in San Francisco, and we taught at the same school Alice. I‚Äôm not having the rest of this conversation over the phone. It‚Äôs not fair to either of us. I love you, but we are not okay.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio waited before she hung up. They had agreed a long time ago to never hang up on each other, especially when upset.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI love you too, and that‚Äôs fair. I‚Äôll be up there in a few days. Be careful.‚Äù With that, they hung up, and Alice slumped into Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat did I do?‚Äù Alice whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smoothed her hair and rubbed her back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat you thought was best, and you stuck to the law, no matter how many times Lilia told you to tell Rio everything anyway vaguely.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice sat up to look at her wife.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat do I do now?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat you always do. Seek Lilia‚Äôs guidance and then head up to face the music while I face whatever fresh hell is about to break out here.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen knew that nothing good was about to come from whatever part Nat had played and just where Rio‚Äôs mind had gone when she found out about Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù Wanda asked Rio after the connection ended.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was looking out of the windshield at the scenery, trying to process it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFourteen years,‚Äù it was all she could say.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know how you feel,‚Äù Wanda said in solidarity.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe should go snowboarding while we‚Äôre up here, or snowmobiling, definitely to a bar.‚Äù Rio was compartmentalizing but also trying to find something to distract both of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe have no security detail, recognizable faces, and it‚Äôs a peak time of year.‚Äù Wanda grinned mischievously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLook up stuff for us to do. We‚Äôre going to have fun, and for once, I‚Äôll be the one causing Jen‚Äôs blood pressure to rise.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio set her green suitcase on the floor of what Lilia had called a cabin. Rio was expecting a log cabin with a fireplace, maybe two bedrooms, and a bathroom. This was more like a mountain retreat, complete with a hot tub and a game room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWow, you guys call this a cabin?‚Äù Rio let out a low whistle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She‚Äôd been a part of this bitch pack for seven months now and she still hadn‚Äôt gotten used to the magnitude of it all. Wanda smiled as she searched for something.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt has wooden features, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She took a picture frame off the wall and opened a panel behind it, revealing a switchboard of some kind, and flipped several off. Rio‚Äôs eyes followed the woman as she closed the panel, replaced the picture, and continued on her search.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù Rio finally asked as she watched Wanda find a screwdriver and head upstairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDisabling the inside cameras. Of course, there aren‚Äôt any in private areas, and I‚Äôll keep the outside ones enabled, but the inside ones go to an app on Lilia‚Äôs phone. We don‚Äôt need anyone to know what we‚Äôre up to. That‚Äôs exactly why she sent you, us, here. So she could keep her eyes and ears on us both. She forgets who raised me. I WIN LILIA!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda finished before heading up the stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, go claim a room. Lilia has maintained this place and recently renovated it, but knowing her, the room I usually stayed in is still mine, and Agatha‚Äôs is still hers, up here, hall on the right, room on the left.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio picked her suitcase back up and headed up the stairs behind Wanda. She might as well stay in Agatha‚Äôs room. She knew what was going to happen. She and Wanda would talk things through with each other, Agatha and Nat, maybe even Alice, would come up, and everyone would talk, and she would fall back into Agatha‚Äôs arms. That was the habit they were building, wasn‚Äôt it?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hadn‚Äôt done anything other than withholding information, which Rio had admittedly also done. It was just that Agatha kept doing it, and this was important for Rio to know. Especially since it affected her relationship with her best friend. Not to mention there were a lot of holes to fill in with the past now. She remembered every detail of those run-ins with Agatha all those years ago and the following mornings. What was the real story as to why she was there?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They could talk through that later. As for now, she walked into the room that Wanda had labeled as Agatha‚Äôs, and Rio agreed. It had been updated, but Lilia had kept the touches of Agatha here. Not as a shrine, but as a reminder of the times spent here, the times Rio assumed Agatha had spent here with Lorna trying to detox. Wanda had talked about their trips here, all those years ago. Of a time Agatha had broken her leg trying to show off for a hot ski instructor, Lorna bringing back a souvenir. The souvenir was a 6‚Äô3 blonde man who was visiting from Texas, and they dated for four months.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked around the room with its purple accents. A stuffed moose that looked old enough to have chronic back pain sat in the middle of the bed on the pillows. There was a picture on the nightstand of an extremely young Agatha - not more than twenty, with Lorna and Lilia on either side of her, leaning against a pool table. Agatha had a devilish smirk on her face as if she knew she had each woman wrapped around her little finger. Lorna had an arm wrapped around Agatha, with Lilia‚Äôs hand in hers. The way these women held themselves was as if they knew that their mere presence could cast a spell on someone, and they would immediately be at their service.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Looking around the room, Rio could see how much hope Lilia had that everything would eventually be reconciled, whether Rio was in the picture or not. She ran a hand through her hair and huffed. Rio knew how important found and chosen family was and how much she would put into reconciling with Alice, no matter how betrayed she felt at the moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot to take in, and the feelings are all over the place. I get it.‚Äù Wanda was leaning against the door frame. ‚ÄúSo, snowmobiles? Bars? Tattoos? What reckless decisions should we make?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Rio turned to her suitcase. ‚ÄúLet me find something more weather-appropriate. Have you told Nat where you are?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo. She can track me if she‚Äôs so concerned,‚Äù Wanda said curtly as she pushed off the doorframe and went back to her room to change.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wearing your necklace!‚Äù Rio called after her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a big girl, she can figure it out,‚Äù Wanda called back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was late afternoon when they arrived at the snowmobile rental place. Wanda looked over at Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHave you ever driven one of these?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, but Taylor and Harry did it. How hard can it be?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey also got into an accident and almost died.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda hadn‚Äôt done this in years, and the last time she had, she very narrowly missed a tree.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs not do that.‚Äù Rio looked at her as if it was a simple task.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, if we die, Jen can‚Äôt be mad, right?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Rio confirmed with a nod.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While they had attempted to disguise themselves, they had done so poorly as people near them were starting to whisper and take pictures. Wanda looked delighted. ‚ÄúYou wanted this to happen, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Rio whispered out of the side of her mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded enthusiastically as they signed papers and took the keys from a starstruck kid who was not so subtly taking pictures.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They walked outside to find their vehicles and hopefully not end up wrapped around a tree. Rio noticed that her notifications for various apps were already increasing by the second.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey, Red, looks like we‚Äôve been sighted together.‚Äù Rio zipped her phone into her snow pants and climbed on the black snowmobile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was tucking her hair into her helmet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIs that so? What else are the citizens of the internet saying?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put on her own helmet and started the snowmobile engine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat we were standing very closely together,‚Äù Rio yelled over the noise of the engines as she started to pull slowly out of the lot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat a scandal!‚Äù Wanda yelled as she followed her. They both picked up speed as they hit the open snow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>

<span>
       Much earlier that morning
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat couldn‚Äôt sleep and, knowing Agatha had gone straight to Lilia‚Äôs, decided to join both of them. Nat had done what she could to keep Lilia in her life, even if at the edges. Lilia and Lorna had done so much for her all of those years ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Wanda met Vision and subsequently fell in love, Nat stayed strong for Wanda but died on the inside. She went straight to the two people who had more experience with relationships. Lorna changed relationships more than some people changed their sheets, and Lilia was polyamorous before there was even a mainstream term for it Nat knew making Vision disappear, while the easiest solution was not the best solution. The two wise aunts of her youth, however, helped both of them navigate the rocky terrain of their relationship with Wanda and each other. It hadn‚Äôt been easy, but Nat and Vision made it work, and all three of them were stronger for it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda never knew just how integral Lorna and Lilia had been to her happiness or just how close she had been to losing both Nat and Vision. However, that‚Äôs a story for another time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat smiled wryly at the memories and advice from the older women, two of three members of the original coven, as she walked up the few steps to Lilia‚Äôs and used the key she had made years ago to let herself in. When Lorna died, Nat had taken her protection charge from Lorna to include Lilia, and she unofficially watched out for her, too. Nat suspected Lilia knew and never said anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia looked up from where she and Agatha were talking and did a once-over of the newcomer, completely unfazed by her unlocking the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou look like shit, kid,‚Äù Lilia said as she finished her assessment and Agatha agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNeither of you looks any better,‚Äù Nat retorted, walking to the kitchen and pouring herself a glass of water. After a moment of consideration, she also opened the freezer and took out a bottle of vodka. She walked back into the living room and sat next to Lilia on the couch. Agatha had moved back to the chair, legs thrown over one of the arms. Nat raised the bottle to Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou still keep the emergency vodka, I see.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI never know when you‚Äôll need it.‚Äù She smiled warmly and patted Nat on the leg. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat shot Agatha a dirty look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSomeone told me to keep a secret from Wanda of all people for years, and it blew up in my face tonight. Spectacularly,‚Äù Nat‚Äôs bottom lip began to quiver. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs so upset with me, and I know she‚Äôs not mad about what happened. She‚Äôs mad that I never told her and that I should have. We‚Äôve never fought like that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat leaned into Lilia and sobbed in a way that Agatha wasn‚Äôt sure she had ever seen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat was the most steadfast and strongest of them all. Yes, she had shed a few tears here and there, she had cried at Lorna‚Äôs funeral, cried tears of joy in delivery rooms, and cried at Jen and Alice‚Äôs wedding. Agatha had seen Nat cry. She had never seen Nat sob and openly weep like this. She wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what was happening as she watched Lilia soothe Nat. This was not the sadness associated with hurting someone. There was something else there, something Agatha hadn‚Äôt seen in Nat. It was a fear and sorrow combined. But, what was different this time?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, Agatha understood that in the past, Nat had cried over what she could not have. Now, she cried at ruining what she finally had, and it was all Agatha‚Äôs fault.
     </span>

       Three Days After Lorna‚Äôs Death
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha had been packing to leave for San Francisco the next day. She had stopped and sat on the edge of her bed to catch her breath. She felt like she was drowning again, and she couldn‚Äôt get enough air into her lungs. She clutched the locket in her hand as she felt the familiar sting at the back of her eyes, though she knew the tears wouldn‚Äôt come right now. She couldn‚Äôt remember the last time she had anything to drink, and she knew she was dehydrated.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       That‚Äôs when she heard the door downstairs fly open, and Nat‚Äôs voice quickly followed it, ‚ÄúAGATHA! I need you! AGATHA! Something‚Äôs not right!‚Äù Natasha‚Äôs voice was full of alarm and uncertainty, and Nat was never either of those things.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha didn‚Äôt remember running down the stairs, too afraid something happened to Wanda, and knowing that her heart wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúNat? Is it Wanda? What happened? Is she okay?‚Äù Agatha knew her eyes were swollen and red and that she was an absolute mess as she gripped Nat‚Äôs shoulders. She was not yet thirty-eight and had just lost the closest thing to a mother she had. Not everyone was given a replacement mother, and she had been, only to lose her entirely too soon.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Nat looked like she had seen a ghost, and Agatha quickly pushed her pain and grief aside for a few moments as she saw the fear, worry, and confusion in the younger woman‚Äôs eyes.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúNatasha, what happened?‚Äù Agatha asked again.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúA few days ago, Lorna asked me about certain,‚Äù Nat tilted her head back and forth as if looking for a way to phrase it, ‚Äú‚Äòmedications,‚Äô and I thought she was researching a role or something.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Nat was staring into Agatha‚Äôs very being, willing her to understand, not wanting to say the words. Agatha had seen the reports. She knew exactly what had happened. She had read that first letter. Lorna didn‚Äôt say where she had gotten her means to an end, just that she had. Everything clicked, and she knew.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Nat removed one of Agatha‚Äôs hands from her shoulder and thrust a piece of paper into it. Agatha read Lorna‚Äôs words, and her head dropped.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúDamnit Lorna, why?‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She whispered before looking back at Nat, and dropping the other hand, giving her the note back.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you why; she just knew what she was doing,‚Äù Agatha explained while Nat nodded, accepting it. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt tell Wanda.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI tell Wanda everything. There are no secrets between us, Agatha.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúLorna didn‚Äôt want anyone to know for very specific reasons, and I have to honor that. Please?‚Äù It was more of a plea than anything.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Nat was struggling internally. How was she supposed to keep this from the woman she loved more than anything? Yes, Agatha had a sworn loyalty to Lorna, and they both knew that Wanda was terrible at keeping secrets. It was a miracle their‚Ä¶situation hadn‚Äôt been splashed everywhere by now. She assumed that was Agatha‚Äôs doing. Nat gave a resigned sigh.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWhat happens when she eventually finds out, Agatha? What then?‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI deal with it then. Trust me, Nat, it will be fine.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha tried to smile, but she didn‚Äôt have it in her right now. She knew what would happen. She would take every ounce of blame for Nat. She would never come in between two of her favorite people. She was still living for the hope of Wanda and Nat getting their happily ever after. She had already come in between one extremely strong friendship. She wouldn‚Äôt come in between a relationship. Nat still looked conflicted as Agatha wrapped her arms around her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI love you both so much, and I will do anything to protect both of you. This is for your protection too, you know. I will do whatever I need to do if she finds out, okay? I am so sorry you were dragged into this, and I know if Lorna had another option, she never would have involved you.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha kissed her on the top of the head and leaned back to look at her, using the pad of her thumb to wipe the one lone tear from Nat‚Äôs cheek.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúCareful, Romanov, someone will think you‚Äôve gone soft,‚Äù Agatha teased.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù Nat mumbled. ‚ÄúI know Lorna must have had her reasons. I won‚Äôt say anything, but if and when she finds out, I trust you to fix it, Agatha,‚Äù Nat‚Äôs blue-green eyes were stormy blue, severe, and serious. Nat looked like the eighteen-year-old assassin Agatha first knew, not the twenty-seven-year-old woman who stood before her.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúI promise, kid. Now, go pack and provide the type of comfort only you can provide, Wanda. Vision has all the boys at the clubhouse right now, and she needs her North Star.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Nat smiled at the nickname Wanda had given her years ago. ‚ÄúHow do you know about that?‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWanda can‚Äôt keep a secret.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou promised me, Agatha,‚Äù Nat said between sobs as she glared at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was staring at her blankly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She blinked, coming out of her memories.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou promised you‚Äôd fix it,‚Äù Nat repeated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her with warmth and false confidence.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Am I trying to convince Nat or myself of this?
      </span>
</em>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAnd I will, once she‚Äôs ready to talk to us, once they‚Äôre both ready. You know as well as I do that they both need time.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia chuckled, ‚ÄúRight, and who told you to wait before going to talk to Rio?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúCan it, Calderu.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes. She turned back to Natasha, who seemed to be slowing a bit with her sobs. Agatha‚Äôs first reaction had been to go to her, but it seemed as though Natasha had needed Lilia more. Agatha thought that she had just removed Lilia from her life, and Lorna‚Äôs by extension. However, Lilia had stayed away from all of them. She was slowly learning that they all retained relationships with Lilia but not in the same capacity and intensity. Nat had been right to say that it wasn‚Äôt Agatha‚Äôs decision. She remembered back to when Wanda first met Vision and how Nat had been a bit guarded when Wanda and Vision had first started dating. Nat had spent a lot of time doing extra weapons training those first few weeks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at Lilia. Nat was now quieter, the vodka had calmed her and brought her back to the intense Slavic introspective state. She drank water instead of vodka as she leaned against Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt was you, and I‚Äôm sure Lorna,‚Äù Agatha pointed a finger in Lilia‚Äôs direction accusingly. ‚ÄúWhen Wanda and Vision started dating, worlds began to collide. Nat went to the two of you. You two are the reason they get along so well. Nat didn‚Äôt just roll over, she was pissed and ready to put up a fight. Vision is a golden retriever, she‚Äôs a black cat, and you two somehow got them to work it all out.‚Äù Agatha realized that she had two Ms. Miyagi‚Äôs and she was the grasshopper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat looked at her. ‚ÄúSome of the best advice either of us got.‚Äù She looked back at Lilia. ‚ÄúSounds like you both should have taken your own advice.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia sighed. ‚ÄúSometimes the burden of being wise is knowing what advice to give to others and not knowing what advice to keep for yourself.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat gave a short laugh and looked back at Agatha. ‚ÄúYou must have learned that from them, too.‚Äù She then looked between both of them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre repairing things. You two need each other.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha crossed her arms over her chest like a petulant teen. ‚ÄúI do not need anyone,‚Äù She lied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, shut up,‚Äù Lilia and Nat said in unison.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia regarded Nat carefully as if to make sure she wasn‚Äôt at risk of breaking apart again. ‚ÄúAre you okay? I haven‚Äôt seen you like that since you came to us worried you would lose Wanda.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat let out a shaky breath. ‚ÄúI think so? As long as I don‚Äôt lose her. It takes a lot to break me, but hurting or losing her? Russian assassin training didn‚Äôt prepare for that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia gave her a look of warmth and put a comforting hand on her knee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThere are some things in life that we cannot prepare or train for,‚Äù Lilia turned and looked at Agatha as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt that in her soul.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell damn, we‚Äôre just all getting insight tonight, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù Agatha ran her hand through her tangled mess of hair. ‚ÄúSo do we wait for Alice to join team ‚Äòwin Rio and Wanda back‚Äô or go up ourselves?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat slumped back onto the couch. ‚ÄúShe knew, didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Lilia both nodded. ‚ÄúAlice has been keeping a lot of cards close to her chest, right Lils?‚Äù Agatha shot her a look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI told her to tell Rio everything, law be damned,‚Äù Lilia replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh fuck. She might be in deeper shit than we are,‚Äù Nat took a swig of emergency vodka out of solidarity for Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúEither way, the next few days are going to be interesting for you three,‚Äù Lilia gestured.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúUs? You‚Äôre not getting out of this unscathed.‚Äù Agatha said, sitting up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, but I‚Äôve been preparing for this and wasn‚Äôt blindsided.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI need to get better at telling the truth,‚Äù Agatha admitted, surprising even herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo shit, can we get a recording of that?‚Äù Nat pulled out her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hard lesson to learn,‚Äù Lilia spoke from experience.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had always learned her lessons the hard way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had returned to the compound around nine Sunday morning. She knew she had to wait before rushing up to the Mammoth Lakes area where Lilia‚Äôs cabin was, roughly three hours south of the Tahoe cabin. She would shower, pack preemptively, and bide her time. Nat had stayed back at Lilia‚Äôs for a bit to let the vodka wear off before driving, and they all agreed it was best to wait until Wanda left before she went back to the house. Vision had texted Nat to ask what was up since he was keeping the twins, and she told him everything. Agatha had always been amazed at how quickly they had formed a bond all those years ago, and it really didn‚Äôt surprise her that Lilia and Lorna had a hand in that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had played puppetmaster more than she knew.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha showered and thought of Rio. Lilia had told her about the conversation, so she knew that it was the omissions and the lies that bothered Rio the most. Not to mention the
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       who
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      of it all. Agatha had slept with the majority of the women at SHIELD, which didn‚Äôt bother Rio, but Rio had developed a working friendship with Lilia, more than that, Rio trusted Lilia. Lilia had given Rio advice, pushed them together, and had a hand in bringing her out here.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then there was just Lilia, as part of Agatha. Lilia wasn‚Äôt just another notch in the mountain of invisible lipstick cases either. Lilia was the only other relationship that Agatha had ever been in, as contorted as it was. Rio also hadn‚Äôt known just how big of a part Lorna and Lilia had played in Agatha‚Äôs past, it wasn‚Äôt something they talked about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs time to write a book about the first part of my life,‚Äù she said to the empty bathroom as she turned the water off and stepped out of the shower to dry off and put on comfortable clothes. She planned on taking a nap and texting Rio later. She wanted to give her some space right now and let her spend time with Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The contrast of where she was yesterday evening and now stood out to her. Yesterday, they were celebrating Alice and Jen, and she was picturing her future with Rio. Now, she was preparing to fight for that future. She would be fifty-two soon, and she was done letting the trauma of the past hold her back. She and Rio needed to communicate and, for the love of all things holy and unholy, be honest with each other. Discuss what they wanted, talk through where they stood, and discuss a way forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had to stop, separate her personas and truths, merging them into one person, for Rio at least. She would always put on a different mask for public consumption, but for her loved ones, she had to remove this mask she had been wearing. She had to let down the walls she had constructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She also had to fix things with Wanda, she and Lilia were mending their relationship, and she had to speak with Alice before she spoke with Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen was going to be working overtime this week when Agatha and Wanda weren‚Äôt where they were supposed to be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned as she rolled over to try to take a nap.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Something warm was on Agatha‚Äôs chest. Something warm and loud. She cracked her eyes open and looked down to see two green eyes staring at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRaven? How did you get here?‚Äù She asked, fully expecting a spoken response. Instead, the cat just looked at her, as if expecting the human to read her mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, memories of the last twenty-four hours rushed back. She remembered that Rio had headed north with Wanda and suspected that Alice had been lying to her for over a decade. This would make sense as to why Raven would be here since Rio fully trusted Nicky to take care of the person that Rio might love most in this world. Her cat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNicky has you for a few days, doesn‚Äôt he? Well, welcome back, Your Highness,‚Äù Agatha said as she gently lifted Raven off of her chest and placed her on a pillow. Raven rewarded her with a low growl. ‚ÄúWell, I love you too.‚Äù Agatha got up and went to find Nicky to see what he knew.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was mid-afternoon, and she found him downstairs sitting on one of the couches, scrolling on his phone. He raised his head when he heard her come down the stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThere you are, Mom. Come sit down, we need to talk.‚Äù His voice was serious, and so was his facial expression.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was slightly taken aback as she had a seat and looked at her son.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGeeze Dad, what did I do? I promise it was Johnny who caused me to stay out past curfew!‚Äù She played innocent, trying to make him laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It didn‚Äôt work.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúCut the theatrics, Mom, this is serious. Tommy and Billy are at Uncle Vision‚Äôs house. Aunt Nat didn‚Äôt get home until after Aunt Wanda left. Rio and Aunt Wanda disappeared to the mountains, and they didn‚Äôt go to the cabin in Tahoe. Alice didn‚Äôt know anything and was worried when she called Rio. You left late last night and didn‚Äôt get home until this morning. I‚Äôm taking care of Raven instead of Alice.‚Äù He threw a hand into the air. ‚ÄúWhat is going on?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her son, realization hitting her like a blow from an MMA fighter. Nicky was like her in so many ways, and she and Wanda, along with Vision and Nat, had worked so hard to raise these boys in a happy and healthy home with many adults who loved them. They had vowed to let them be kids and give them every opportunity they could. They made sure to take care of their social-emotional and psychological needs as well as their physical and educational needs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Yet here Nicky was, still wise beyond his years. It wasn‚Äôt a bad thing, but Agatha wondered just how much of his youth she may have stolen from him. How much he had been forced to grow up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Like she had been.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      How many times had he parented her? Like he was doing now. She had always treated him like an actual human being. She had never talked down to him or treated him like a second or third-class citizen like some people did with children.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Here he was, demanding answers for what should be adult problems, yet he cared because it did involve him. This was his family, and she didn‚Äôt want him to worry.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt as though she was waking up from a nearly twenty-year dark night and realizing there had been quite a few casualties along the way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBefore I answer any of your questions, Nicholas, do I allow you to be a kid?‚Äù She asked softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      His shocked expression as he thought about how to answer told Agatha that this was not the conversation he had been expecting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes. You give me a lot of independence, and I honestly think I‚Äôm better for it. Billy and Tommy, too. You, Aunt Wanda, Aunt Nat, and Uncle Vision, you‚Äôre all as involved as you possibly can be, and unlike our friends with famous parents, we weren‚Äôt constantly left with nannies or other people. I love that we have a compound of people and our private little woods to explore. I wouldn‚Äôt change the way I grew up and am still growing up for anything, Mom. I wish I didn‚Äôt see details about my mom‚Äôs other activities everywhere though, and I have seen some pictures of you, and Aunt Wanda, by accident that I did not want to see.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky‚Äôs face was one of pure teenage disgust. Agatha remembered that day. He had been very curious as to why there were certain movies of theirs he couldn‚Äôt watch. Just like his mother, he found out the hard way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He never questioned either of them again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm wiser than my peers, don‚Äôt look so shocked that I‚Äôm self-aware, Mom. I hear it from my teachers. I think that comes from being a Harkness and all the social-emotional workshops and different things we were put in as kids. My childhood has been different, but you still let me be a kid. You allowed me to make mistakes, but I still had and have consequences, I played more than my share of pranks. You didn‚Äôt take my childhood from me, Mom. It‚Äôs been different, but all three of us are still getting to be kids. We just have to reverse roles sometimes because our three moms didn‚Äôt get to be kids. You may think you‚Äôve buried the past, but there are some very dedicated fan accounts out there.‚Äù He took a drink of the soda he had. ‚ÄúThere are also some very interesting pictures that I‚Äôm sure you didn‚Äôt know existed.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I want to know how much you know.‚Äù Agatha hated how dedicated some of her fans were. She was flattered, yes, but also, she didn‚Äôt need that complication.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThank you for being honest, Nicky, and please remember to be a kid. No one is pushing or forcing you to grow up, okay? Enjoy this time while you can.‚Äù She moved to sit next to him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a great kid.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have some pretty awesome parents, but most of all, Agatha Harkness is a kick-ass mom.‚Äù Raven jumped over the back of the couch and positioned herself in between them. ‚ÄúRight, the actual reason for all this. Mom? What is going on?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked down at the purring traitor and scratched her under the chin. ‚ÄúWhere to begin? Okay, I told you I was in a relationship once, right?‚Äù She couldn‚Äôt remember who knew what.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, before I was born. No, I don‚Äôt know who that was, and I do not need to know.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky tried to keep his mother‚Äôs indiscretions separate. Rio was one thing, he didn‚Äôt need to know about any others. They weren‚Äôt important.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRight, well Rio figured out who it was yesterday at the reception and didn‚Äôt exactly take it well. That set off a series of events which led to several difficult conversations. Nat revealed something she was keeping from Wanda‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky‚Äôs jaw dropped. ‚ÄúAunt Nat kept something from Aunt Wanda? I didn‚Äôt think that was possible for them to do.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky knew that his aunts were always honest with each other, no matter what.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, so Wanda is hurt, as you can imagine, and Rio is mad at me because, yet again, I didn‚Äôt tell her the complete story. So the two of them went to Lilia's cabin, where Lorna and I spent a lot of time when I was much younger. Rio then found out Alice and I were closer than Alice let on, and that‚Äôs it in a nutshell.‚Äù She explained quickly, hoping he didn‚Äôt connect the dots.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky pretended he did not connect the dots and pushed the unwanted information to the dredges of his mind. He could work through that in another ten to fifteen years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo go after her. All three of you, go after them.‚Äù He looked at her like she was an idiot for staying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She shook her head. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt yet. They need some time to talk about things and process, and then we‚Äôll go up there and get everything worked out.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky gave his mom a sad look. ‚ÄúThis is what I was worried about.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know, Nicholas.‚Äù She patted his knee. ‚ÄúThis is what I tried to prevent, and I did a terrible job of it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt kill you to just stick to the truth, Mom.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if I know what it is anymore. Not completely.‚Äù She frowned down at the floor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMom, I suggest you journal. It‚Äôs a very healthy coping mechanism.‚Äù Journaling! He should be having fun, not getting on to his mother.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGo back to being a kid. Have a pasture party, throw a house party in the clubhouse, do something.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBefore I throw a party so epic the cops get called and I begin my criminal record, you better get her back, Mom. Yes, you both have your baggage, but she‚Äôs good for you. Your son cannot have a more stable relationship than you do, and I like seeing you happy. You‚Äôre not the only one that will lose.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She nodded and patted his shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know, kiddo. I love you and thank you for parenting me sometimes.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He scoffed. ‚ÄúYeah, well, you need it. I‚Äôve seen your criminal record.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThose records are sealed, sir.‚Äù She held her hand to her chest in shock.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo you do have a criminal record!‚Äù He affirmed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat? You tricked me!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI learned from the best. I love you too, Mom. Make sure you get my future stepmom back, and I am absolutely having that party next week.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The wind whipped past Rio‚Äôs face, filling her with a rare exhilaration as they zipped through the trees in the growing darkness. She knew they should head back, but they had headlights, and these things were easy to maneuver. She was probably going entirely too fast, and neither of them were in their twenties anymore. If they wiped out, they could seriously injure themselves.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked over her shoulder at Wanda to motion to her to turn around, to see Wanda pointing frantically and slowing down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned around too late and hit the snowbank going extremely too fast. The vehicle went airborne as Rio went over the handlebars and landed in the snow, everything going black.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio! Rio! Oh God, if you die, Agatha is going to kill me.‚Äù Wanda had gently taken Rio‚Äôs helmet off and was looking down at her, worried and blinking back tears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Laughter floated to Rio‚Äôs ears, and she was immediately angry. Who would laugh at this situation? She could be seriously injured.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, she realized she was the one laughing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWanda, I‚Äôm fine!‚Äù She sat up and groaned. She would absolutely feel this in the morning. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be bruised in the morning, and my head hurts, but I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe need to get you to a medic or something. you could have a concussion.‚Äù Wanda‚Äôs eyes were wide as she looked around to see if there was anyone around that she could flag down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúA medic? What is this, war? Don‚Äôt worry, battle buddy, I‚Äôll be fine. Help me up. Let‚Äôs return these and go find a bar or something. Nothing a few shots won‚Äôt cure.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio carefully stood with Wanda‚Äôs assistance and waited a moment to make sure she was balanced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm good,‚Äù Rio said, taking a few steps and almost falling down. Wanda caught her by the waist. ‚ÄúThat was a trust fall,‚Äù Rio said as Wanda side-eyed her. ‚ÄúNo, really, I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Rio let Wanda help her over to the overturned snowmobile. It was a little dented but turned on and seemed to still run.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you sure you can drive?‚Äù Wanda asked skeptically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôll just go slower, and I‚Äôll make sure to stay near you.‚Äù Her head was pounding. ‚ÄúDo you know if there‚Äôs a first aid station anywhere? It probably wouldn‚Äôt hurt to get checked out, just in case,‚Äù Rio said as she touched her head and winced at how tender it was. No blood, so the helmet did its job, but it didn‚Äôt feel great.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre surrounded by chaos. I think I saw one between here and the rental place. Come on, don‚Äôt get hurt anymore. Remember, we only have our phones for Nat to track us if they figure out we left the necklaces at the cabin, and service isn‚Äôt that reliable out here.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda mounted the snowmobile and watched Rio as she got on hers. The first aid station was right next to their destination. The women returned their rentals first, thankful they had gone with the insurance to cover any damages. Rio seemed to be doing better after the initial shock to her system, though Wanda still insisted she get checked out. Rio‚Äôs phone had survived the impact, for which she was immensely grateful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They stepped into the small building that was equipped to handle basic emergencies until other arrangements could be made. The nurse‚Äôs eyes widened once she realized who had just walked through the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Wanda Maximoff!‚Äù She exclaimed, blinking rapidly like she was trying to clear her vision. She was a short woman with pale skin and short blonde hair cut in a bob. She had blue eyes and, if Rio had to guess, was in her late fifties. The woman looked at Rio, still stunned. ‚ÄúAnd you look like you‚Äôve had better days. Rio, right?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She asked as she pointed to a table and turned to get gloves, the shock wearing off as she set to her task.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sharon, Wanda dear, have a seat. I‚Äôm a big fan of yours and Agatha‚Äôs. I thought I heard whispers that you were here again.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon went over Rio, checking her eyes with a flashlight, lightly pressing her neck, and checking her scalp for any contusions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have some nasty bruises tomorrow, but that helmet did its job. You took a nasty tumble. Did you hit a snowbank?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. This woman was good.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGoing about seventy, flew over the handlebars?‚Äù Sharon continued. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen this same scenario hundreds of times.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly what happened. It was terrifying.‚Äù Wanda said from behind them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMost people walk away with just bruises. You were still lucky. That could have been much worse. Now, you need to be very careful with that head injury. You do have a mild concussion, and you need to keep an eye on it. No strenuous activity for the next couple of days, definitely no more snow sports.‚Äù Sharon looked at Wanda. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let her do anything stupid, please.‚Äù Sharon unlocked a cabinet and grabbed a bottle of prescription-strength Tylenol. ‚ÄúHere, this will help. I trust you both to take these responsibly.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They nodded, feeling as though they were being scolded and threatened at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNow that we‚Äôve got the head and neck out of the way, how does the rest of your body feel?‚Äù Sharon asked, looking her over with well-trained and knowledgeable eyes. She had done this for so long and had listened to her breathing, watched her walk, how she talked, and how she sat. She knew nothing was majorly broken, and there wasn‚Äôt any internal bleeding. Rio might not actually have a concussion, but Sharon firmly believed in being cautious with heads and brains.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sore, but I‚Äôve had broken bones before, and nothing feels broken,‚Äù Rio thought back to a year ago when she was in the hospital, and while she hurt, it was not like that. The snow was much softer than the pavement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGood. If you feel worse, go to the hospital. You‚Äôre too far from LA to go to your regular doctor.‚Äù Sharon looked from Rio to Wanda. ‚ÄúSo, why are you two up here with seemingly no security detail, girlfriend, fianc√®e, ex-husband, kids, or entourage?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shifted in her chair while Wanda looked away. They both seemed like teenagers who had gotten caught sneaking out in the middle of the night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not telling anyone I saw either of you, laws and all, but I do keep up with celebrity news, and Rio, I know you‚Äôre a teacher and tomorrow is Monday.‚Äù Sharon had seen many things in her decades as a nurse. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the first time celebrities or people dating them have come through trying to escape something. I do still get starstruck because it‚Äôs just so exciting, but you still have to face your problems eventually. Watch your head, blow off some steam, and then face it head-on. Not literally. Whatever it is you two need a break from, you can absolutely handle it, especially since you have each other. Now, I need to close down the clinic, and I have a feeling you are not going to take it easy. I have a few suggestions of places to go to if you want them.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn‚Äôt sure what it was about this woman that seemed familiar, but it did. Sharon wrote down a few different places for them, restaurants that would be more discreet, a karaoke bar, and even tattoo artists she recommended. Rio exchanged numbers with the nurse. She had a feeling they were going to see Sharon Davis-Hart again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they walked back to the car, Rio took two Tylenol and chased them with water that Sharon had given her. She screwed the lid back on and climbed into the passenger seat. ‚ÄúWhy did she seem so familiar?‚Äù Rio asked, buckling her seatbelt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou got that feeling, too? I‚Äôm glad it wasn‚Äôt just me. Maybe she‚Äôs just one of those people?‚Äù Wanda shrugged. ‚ÄúAnyway, dinner? We can change out of snow clothes when we get there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen, concussion be damned, drunken karaoke!‚Äù Rio pumped her fist in the air. It was going to be a fun night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By Sunday evening, Agatha was at Lilia‚Äôs again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIs this becoming a habit?‚Äù Lilia asked as Agatha walked in. ‚ÄúDo I need to install a revolving door? I see you still have your key.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had also noticed the skull and crossbones keychain attached to said key.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot a sword for the keychain?‚Äù Lilia asked, continuing her task in the kitchen as Agatha sat at the table and watched her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt find one.‚Äù She took a sip of her water from her giant tumbler. She was trying to drink mainly water for her next role. ‚ÄúWait, how did you know?‚Äù Agatha said, choking on her water.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia smirked as she stirred a pot of her vodka sauce.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThere were rumors of a certain tattoo on a certain lesbian sweetheart's hip going around SHIELD last year. It was some sort of rite-of-passage confirmation that people had slept with you. For a little while, they called themselves the fencing club.‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
      She laughed as she dropped handmade gnocchi into another pot and watched it closely.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen Rio called me swords last night, and I knew.‚Äù She moved the gnocchi around a bit, ensuring they were cooking evenly before removing them from the boiling water. ‚ÄúLorna always said I was taking a sword to your heart, not a knife. So, it‚Äôs appropriate.‚Äù She portioned the potato pasta into two bowls and put the rest into a third for later. Lilia then spooned vodka sauce into the bowls, picked up forks, and carried them to the table. She placed a bowl in front of Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know, you‚Äôre preparing for a role. Eat,‚Äù Lilia instructed as Agatha opened her mouth to protest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave a small smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI took the nickname from my character‚Äôs tarot card.‚Äù Agatha knew she didn‚Äôt have to name the movie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know. That card was fitting for you as well.‚Äù Lilia took a bite of the gnocchi and looked at Agatha. She looked tired, stressed, and oh so worried. ‚ÄúStill haven‚Äôt heard from them?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stabbed a perfectly shaped potato dumpling. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said tersely, not making eye contact. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to push it, but I‚Äôm worried. Nat hasn‚Äôt heard anything either, but we‚Äôve seen things on social media. Apparently, they went snowmobiling. Why haven‚Äôt they called? Texted? Smoke signals? All day, I have realized just how much I‚Äôve manipulated everyone over the years. Just like‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha looked away, not wanting to admit it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, we did what we thought was best, and that‚Äôs what you were doing. In protecting everyone, we ended up manipulating situations. You never had a childhood, granted. Your generation didn‚Äôt have a childhood, but you especially. You‚Äôve been an adult since your first role. When Lorna met you, she immediately tried to protect you, and then she brought me into it. We did everything we could, and then, well‚Ä¶I very much got sidetracked, and I am so sorry, and I take the blame for teaching you how to split yourself into two people, Agatha.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia just wanted to hug her‚Äîthe years of hurt, the years of good intentions leading to hell. Agatha looked up at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done a lot of thinking this morning, talking to Nicky. I know I‚Äôm going to have even more conversations. Lilia, it‚Äôs not all your fault. Especially as I got older, I knew we were doomed, but I got to a point where I thought that was the only way to keep you in my life, and it wasn‚Äôt. I needed to communicate, we both did. I think that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so nervous about not talking to Rio right now. I know communication needs to happen, and she‚Äôs not communicating.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had always acted older than her years, but for the first time, she looked it. Lilia reached across the table and put her hand on Agatha‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAggie, everything will be okay and work out, okay?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded, softening at Lilia's familiar nickname for her. She needed this, Lilia. The Lilia that always had something cooking, the one that had comforted her when she lost out on roles or awards or put ice packs on bruises that Evanora had inflicted on her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRemember when you taught me how to make alfredo sauce from scratch?‚Äù Agatha asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia laughed. ‚ÄúYes! Lorna and I lived together. You were sixteen, and we decided it was time for you to learn how to make healthy food.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBecause your Alfredo sauce is healthy?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSicilian calories don‚Äôt count, kid. Anyway, Lorna kept laughing because of how big of a mess you were making, even though she had burned the fettuccine noodles.‚Äù Lilia laughed at the memory.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhich I made fun of her for, only then I scorched the cream for the sauce and she wouldn‚Äôt let me live it down,‚Äù Agatha snorted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This was what Agatha had missed and needed back in her life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stood to clear the table when the door flew open, and Alice stormed in with Jen behind her. Jen closed the door softly, eyes narrowing as they landed on Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLilia, Rio knows I‚Äôve been lying to her, not telling her everything, whatever the fuck it is I‚Äôve been doing,‚Äù Alice said as she stormed straight into the kitchen and into Lilia‚Äôs waiting arms. Lilia had stood just in time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha put the now clean dishes on the drainboard and leaned against the counter with her arms crossed over her chest and her legs crossed at the ankles. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been what now?‚Äù Agatha said, now ready to fight someone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, like you haven't been doing that to absolutely everyone you‚Äôve ever met,‚Äù Jen said as she walked into the kitchen and fixed a bowl of gnocchi.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia released Alice. ‚ÄúWhat did I tell you, Alice?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTo tell her everything, law be damned.‚Äù Alice looked down at her shoes, knowing that past Alice was yelling at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWait, just how close are you two?‚Äù Agatha asked, trying to put things together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPretty damn close,‚Äù Jen answered, taking a bite of her food. ‚ÄúLilia, can our next cooking lesson be this sauce?‚Äù Jen asked, trying to goad Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Lilia turned back to Alice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one that told her. I don‚Äôt apologize for that. She needed to know. I didn‚Äôt tell her that you and I have developed a friendship or anything. That was something you needed to do, and you‚Äôve had a year.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know it was. I just, I didn‚Äôt know how, and then she and Agatha became friends, and I barely saw her‚Ä¶‚Äù Alice walked into the living room and sat on the couch, the other three women followed behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre jealous of me again,‚Äù Agatha said knowingly as she sat in her chair. ‚ÄúYou blamed me for taking Lorna away from you, and then you got jealous when Rio and I grew close, even if you were in the same room.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDO YOU BLAME ME?!‚Äù Alice shouted, standing up. ‚ÄúLorna was never my mother. She didn‚Äôt even try until she started dying, and that was from guilt. She did more parenting through letters after she died than she did when she was alive because of you, Agatha. It took me the three years between when she and Gran died to work through that in therapy before I could take the job at SHIELD because I couldn‚Äôt stand to be anywhere near you. To be reminded of what I lost. Gran tried to make sure that Rio and I weren‚Äôt home if Mom was going to be so that we wouldn‚Äôt see whatever state she was in because everyone was trying to protect me. Even Rio tried to protect me from it because of what she saw during her first twelve years of life!‚Äù Alice was breathing heavily while Agatha looked at her lovingly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had zero negative feelings toward Alice, and it only fueled Alice‚Äôs anger.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia touched Jen‚Äôs arm and made her go to the backyard with her, saying she needed help in the garden.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTHEN, because Mom had specific instructions on some of her letters, there was one I was supposed to open when Gran died. Do you know what THAT letter said? That sixteen-year-old Agatha Harkness and Lilia were the two people who convinced her to keep me. The person she chose to raise over me was the person who had said, ‚ÄòLorna, you‚Äôll be a great mom. Keep your kid.‚Äô She also went on to say how much you wanted her to move Gran and me to LA. How many times you told her that she did a great job with you and would do a great job with me, too. How could I be mad at that? As an adult, I came to terms with it, and I was fine, but then Rio moved out here, and I felt it bubble up again. I want Rio to be happy. I encouraged this, and I still do because I know how much she loves you and Agatha, you love her so much. But fuck, I was transported back to that kid that always saw Lorna Wu on red carpets next to Agatha Harkness on TV. Or Lorna Wu talk about Agatha Harkness in interviews, and now my sister is being talked about by Agatha Harkness. So yes, I did get jealous because it‚Äôs deja vu for me, okay?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice‚Äôs chest was rising and falling rapidly, her anger still on display. Agatha‚Äôs face had not changed. She knew this day was coming.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen, when I came out here, I knew that Mom and Lilia had been close. Mom told me so in a letter. So yes, Lilia and I developed a friendship, and then Jen and I developed a friendship, and I made the biggest mistake of my life by not telling Rio, and when Rio told me you had been in a relationship forever ago, Jen and I guessed it was Lilia. You and Lilia kept each other at arm‚Äôs length, which we thought was odd considering how close she and Mom used to be, how close you and Mom were, and the stories we‚Äôve heard. Then I lied to my best friend and sister, and based on Wanda going with Rio, it sounds like you did the same thing. I‚Äôm you.‚Äù Alice finally lost steam and plopped down on the couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not me, Alice. You weren‚Äôt lying or withholding for selfish reasons. I have tried to apologize and make things up to you since you moved out here, before, really. I love and care for you so much and have since the day you were born, and you refuse to see it or let me get too close. I cut your umbilical cord. Well, Lilia, your mother and I, we all did it together. Your mother did such a fantastic job that day. I was exhausted. She was a superhero.‚Äù Agatha smiled at the memory. ‚ÄúYes, I was still a baby myself when you were born, kiddo, and when your mother decided I was a great candidate to leave you with if something were to happen. Please know that I have been trying to do whatever I could to make up for you not being raised by Lorna. I still feel guilty about it, and it‚Äôs still a thing I discuss with my therapist. It‚Äôs also one of the reasons I am so involved with Nicky, put him in different programs, raised him the way I did, built the compound with Wanda, and am bringing you into the compound because of what your mother taught me about chosen family and parenting. If I need to push Rio to spend more one-on-one time with you, I will. I understand needing that time and I am so thankful that Vis and Nat have always understood that about Wanda and me.
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI never meant to take Lorna from you, and that was her decision. I will never take Rio from you. You do have a lot to explain to her, though, just as I have a few more tough conversations to have myself.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha moved next to Alice and wrapped her arms around her like she would with Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOne of the things your mother wrote to me in one of her letters was to make sure you knew how much she loved you, and Alice, she really did. It‚Äôs why she did what she did, leaving you with Norma.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha squeezed her. Alice nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know that now, and I know you aren‚Äôt awful. I should have been honest with Rio and you, too.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt sounds like a lot of us should have been. Now, just how close have you and Lilia been this whole time?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen sat in a chair on the back porch, staring at Lilia, straining to hear the conversation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She couldn‚Äôt hear anything other than an occasional murmur and looked nervously at Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúEverything will be okay, right?‚Äù She asked the wise-to-her woman in front of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia patted Jen‚Äôs shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course, Jen. This truth that is coming out about everyone changes dynamics a smidge, and everyone will have to adjust to that. There are growing pains in the process. Secrets hurt people. I know that more than anyone.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen and Alice had talked about the possibility of Agatha and Lilia being exes, but now that it had been confirmed, Jen was a bit weirded out by it all. It was a lot to take in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia seemed to be reading Jen‚Äôs mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have let it happen, but people do stupid things. I, unfortunately, let it continue for entirely too long.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs why you kept telling Alice to talk to Rio for so long.‚Äù Jen studied Lilia, trying to read her the way Lilia read others.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes. I told Lorna. I told her everything, and I encouraged Alice to do the same. She never did, and now we‚Äôre here.‚Äù Lilia looked at the door as she heard laughter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good, right?‚Äù Jen looked at the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia nodded. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs our cue. Jen, just keep loving and supporting Alice no matter what.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù Jen rose, reaching for the door, Lilia next to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis could be a very rough week, Jen,‚Äù Lilia reiterated as they reentered the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMy clients are Agatha Harkness and Wanda Maximoff. I‚Äôve been on blood pressure medication since I was thirty-one.‚Äù
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      WandRio, as they were now calling themselves, had found a restaurant that Sharon had recommended on the main strip in town where all the storefronts were designed to look like one large ski resort. In their planning, they had found the karaoke bar and a tattoo parlor, which was no longer a joke and very much a reality as they booked appointments for the next afternoon, knowing they couldn‚Äôt get them after drinking. They had found a place to change and were doing a terrible job at hiding who they were as they sat in a back corner of the rustic dining establishment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow are you feeling about everything?‚Äù Rio asked as she drank her second margarita, having finished her meal at record speed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúJust conflicted. I really need to talk to Nat and Agatha. We‚Äôve been this family for so long, and I was able to keep some contact with Lilia, but not like I wanted to. Lilia, Lorna, and Agatha raised me, and they raised Nat, too. Nat, like Agatha, was always more mature, as you can imagine. I was so naive, and my parents had tried extremely hard to shelter me from what they could, even growing up in a war zone.‚Äù Wanda popped one of the last few fries in her mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm familiar with some of your backstory, what you‚Äôve shared in interviews, and the little bits and pieces I‚Äôve picked up from the past few months. I‚Äôm so sorry for what you went through, Wanda.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was sincere. She remembered seeing footage of that particular Eastern European conflict on the news when she was very young and then learning about it in high school. By then, Wanda was a movie star and was always mentioned as a survivor of the war.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda hated it and yet, just shrugged. It was a habit she developed as a means to avoid the topic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe all have a past, and some are worse than others. Yours isn‚Äôt very pretty, either. Did you know that Norma sent pictures to Lorna of Alice, and we would occasionally see ones with you in them too?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nearly choked on her glorified alcohol slush.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWHAT? No, I certainly did not know that.‚Äù Agatha had seen pictures of her as an awkward teenager? Oh God. How were they dating? She and Agatha had also met a few times, but they had both just laughed those off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou and Alice were so gorgeous at prom when you went together.‚Äù Wanda teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI hate you.‚Äù Rio glared as Wanda laughed, causing a few people to look at them and snap pictures.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAnyway, you didn‚Äôt have a great past, either. Norma didn‚Äôt tell us the whole story of course, just that you had shitty parents and she had decided you were hers and Alice‚Äôs after a few months. Agatha did fill me in after you told her the rest, though.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda ate her last french fry and pushed the plate away from her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI went from a loving, caring family to not that. I met Agatha almost immediately. I was obsessed with sitcoms, and she had been in some of my favorites when she was a child and teenager, and then I was cast in a show with her due to nepotism. She noticed the signs of mistreatment almost immediately, as did Lorna and Lilia, having been through it before with Agatha. It didn‚Äôt take them long to basically get custody of me. My aunt got fired, and who knows what happened to her. I honestly don‚Äôt know, actually.‚Äù Wanda shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAnyway, Lorna and Lilia were quirky, but they loved us. They didn‚Äôt bat an eye when Nat joined the picture. Agatha became the big sister I had always wanted and needed. She got the lawyers for me, an agent, a therapist, and moved me in with her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda stopped when a waitress came by to see if they needed anything else, and they went ahead and requested the check. Wanda continued her story while they waited.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMy aunt had been giving me some pretty strong sleep medications because I had such terrible nightmares, and she didn‚Äôt want to deal with them. When I moved in with Aggie and started therapy, I stopped taking things to help with sleep, though the nightmares still came.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou know what that woman did? She realized I had them at the same time every night and made sure she was home at those times so she could fucking spoon me and help me through the nightmares so I wouldn‚Äôt develop any sort of dependence on the meds because that‚Äôs who the true Agatha Harkness is.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe then built a house, a life, a family together. She took her would-be Russian assassin and gave her a home. She shared her family with me. She gave me so many acting tips and helped me build my career. I can never repay her for everything she‚Äôs done for me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They left the restaurant, entered the karaoke bar, and were finding a table when Wanda looked at Rio. Her eyes looked like they were holding back a river of tears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen I find out she‚Äôs been holding all these things back?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hugged her. ‚ÄúOh, Wanda. I am so sorry.‚Äù Rio knew how it felt. Her chosen sister had been hiding things from her, too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know she was doing what she thought was best, but it still hurts. And Nat?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI think Nat probably went to Agatha, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù Rio reasoned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda thought about it for a few minutes. ‚ÄúThat makes sense, but I‚Äôm still mad. I‚Äôm going to get drinks. You can sign us up for some amazing songs.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A smile spread across Rio‚Äôs face as she slid off the stool and walked up to the sign-up sheet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia looked around her house at the four women that had gathered. Nat joined them and sat on the floor, absentmindedly flipping a pocket knife. Jen was worriedly scrolling through her phone and scowling, using one hand to smooth Alice‚Äôs hair while Alice slept in her lap. Agatha was curled in that ancient armchair Lilia had reupholstered and returned to its rightful place, smirking as she scrolled through social media and looked up at Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPenny for your thoughts.‚Äù Agatha tilted her head. There was a time she could almost read Lilia‚Äôs mind, but that time was long past.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting late,‚Äù Lilia said, pushing away from the doorframe of the kitchen where she had taken up residence.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you kicking me out?‚Äù Agatha said, feigning shock.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A soft smile crossed her face as she walked to where Alice was sleeping and put a hand on her arm. ‚ÄúNot you,‚Äù she said to Agatha and then turned to Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSorry, Jen, I need someone at school tomorrow.‚Äù Lilia looked down at Alice, ‚ÄúAlice, honey, you need to go get some sleep. Teenagers in the morning.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice grumbled as she rubbed her eyes with the heels of her hands. ‚ÄúAny word?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, babe, just social media,‚Äù Jen wiggled the phone at Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow bad?‚Äù Nat asked, not taking her eyes off the knife.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre pretty fucking drunk for eleven on a Sunday night, singing karaoke, cover blown, at a fairly reputable place,‚Äù Jen sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre having a great time and drawing a large crowd,‚Äù Agatha added, watching another video.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhich means this could go on for another day or two,‚Äù Jen groaned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia shook her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it will. Maybe a day. I think they‚Äôll call the three of you tomorrow.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia knew something. Agatha was sure of it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat songs have they done so far?‚Äù Alice sat up and put her feet on the floor to slide her Vans on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚Äú
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Man I Feel Like A Woman, Out of the Woods, No Body, No Crime,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      and
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Father Figure,‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha rattled off. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm keeping all of these videos. Rio singing
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Father Figure
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      is something I need to see live. Am I still upset? Yes. Am I highly amused? Also, yes.‚Äù Agatha was still upset with herself, but the videos of her best friend and girlfriend doing drunken karaoke together were highly entertaining.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs still super drunk and pissed. It‚Äôll come. Okay, babe, take me home and to bed.‚Äù Alice yawned and stretched, not realizing what she had said, as the other three women turned to look in their direction. Jen flushed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat? We‚Äôre married, you heathens.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They said their goodbyes and left. Lilia promised to update Alice in the morning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned back to Lilia as the Sicilian sat on the couch, and Nat joined her. ‚ÄúOut with it, Calderu.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just nice to have a semi-full house again, is all. Yes, Alice has been coming over a fair amount over the years, and Jen. Though it started for the worst reasons, tonight has been nice.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked away, afraid of showing too much emotion. It had been an emotionally loaded weekend.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThings are changing for the better, Lilia,‚Äù Agatha said softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat put the pocket knife away. ‚ÄúThe band‚Äôs getting back together,‚Äù Nat added. ‚ÄúAs soon as we finish our forgiveness tour.‚Äù
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      WandRio was having a blast and enjoying themselves. Rio‚Äôs phone alerted her that they were trending, and she did not want to see the proof. They went to sit at their table as one of the bartenders came over with several shots.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHello, you two. How‚Äôs your head, Rio?‚Äù Sharon asked, lining shots up in front of both of them from the bartender‚Äôs tray.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda and Rio looked at each other and laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing here, Sharon?‚Äù Wanda asked as she and Rio both took a shot that tasted like pineapple.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI own the place.‚Äù She gestured.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDamn, well, we love it,‚Äù Rio told her taking another shot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGood. I wanted to be able to keep an eye on you two tonight. I had a suspicion there‚Äôd be heavy drinking.‚Äù She looked at the now-empty shot glasses.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGuilty.‚Äù They both said at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you two are having fun, but seriously, watch the head.‚Äù She gave Rio a long look before returning to the bar.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe still seems very familiar,‚Äù Rio noted as Wanda nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned back to Wanda. ‚ÄúOkay, what song next?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda grinned. ‚ÄúSilver Springs, Fleetwood Mac. Let‚Äôs get some angst out.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They wrote it down and waited for their turn once more. The bar had filled up once people had heard who was inside, and everyone was more than happy to let the two women have the stage.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn‚Äôt an actress, but she could bring the drama too as the song started and the song started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha, Lilia, and Nat were seated on the couch, holding Agatha‚Äôs phone and watching a live video of the performance as Rio and Wanda belted out
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Silver Springs.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTime casts its spell on you, but you won‚Äôt forget me. I know I could have loved you, but you would not let me‚Ä¶‚Äù Wanda and Rio were somehow standing upright and knew the words, though it was obvious how drunk they were as they sang, looking into each other‚Äôs eyes. The crowd loved it. You could hear it through the phone. The three women on the couch, however, were not. Lilia looked at Agatha, and Agatha looked away. Nat bit her nails.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey know what they‚Äôre doing,‚Äù Lilia said cautiously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs working,‚Äù Agatha said quietly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúCan we go up there yet?‚Äù Nat asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda and Rio were having fun, and Sharon‚Äôs night was going well as her staff continued to fill orders, wash out glasses, and take pictures for social media. She kept a close eye on the two women on stage, diligently staying on task.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was extremely excited about their next song and had told Wanda why. As the music started, Wanda started grinning. She tossed back a shot that one of the employees had handed her, and Rio downed hers as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They looked at each other and started to sing once more, ‚ÄúDo you believe in life after love, after love, after love‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned and tossed her head back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI fucking hate you, Lilia.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe lyrics are supposed to be from your point of view. It‚Äôs not ABOUT you. It was FOR you,‚Äù Lilia explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat was confused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you?‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Came through the speakers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs eyebrows were high on her head as she looked at Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo you helped Cher write a song that was from her and my point of view? Not yours?‚Äù Agatha said in disbelief. ‚ÄúAfter our first major fight?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes. I knew then we should have ended things, and then, well‚Ä¶‚Äù Lilia trailed off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha softened again. ‚ÄúWe made more stupid decisions.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Lilia agreed as she turned to see the song ending.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat got up from the couch. ‚ÄúThis calls for the emergency vodka solely to cleanse images from my brain.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda and Rio knew Jen was back in LA, not sleeping and having heart palpitations if her texts were anything to go by. There were pictures and videos of them everywhere, and they had lost count of how many songs they had sung. They were slurring, and they had just sung all seven-plus minutes of C√©line Dion‚Äôs
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Because You Love Me
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      with everyone left in the bar, which, for four a.m., was still a considerable amount of people. Sharon had been making sure they both had been eating with their alcohol and had given them something for nausea. She finally had to call it a night and close the bar down, kicking everyone out except for Wanda and Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAnother!‚Äù Rio held a shot glass up from her spot laying on the bar on her stomach.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon poured water that she kept in an old vodka bottle into Rio‚Äôs glass and left it for her. ‚ÄúHere you go, hun, on the house,‚Äù she winked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda sat on a stool and laid her head on Rio‚Äôs back, studying Sharon. ‚ÄúYou know us, not just from movies and stuff, but know us,‚Äù she slurred, attempting to watch Sharon closely but just seeing double.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon shook her head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre both just very drunk,‚Äù she reassured as she closed out the registers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, though you don‚Äôt know Rio.‚Äù She jabbed a finger into Rio‚Äôs ribcage. ‚ÄúBut you know the rest of us.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was adamant. Her accent was thick, the way it was only when she was drunk, and she spoke in cursive.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWait!‚Äù Wanda sat up and almost fell over. Rio tried to reach out to catch her and almost fell off the bar herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou own the coffee and games place we used to go to, too! You‚Äôve just always been here and around. You know Lilia! You‚Äôre a plant!‚Äù Wanda threw out the accusation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThree ferns in a trenchcoat!‚Äù Rio added, sitting up and lowering herself to a stool, almost falling to the floor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon laughed. ‚ÄúYou caught me, yes. Lilia asked me to keep an eye on you two. Make sure you‚Äôre safe. Rio, keep drinking that vodka, Wanda, you too, " she instructed. Neither of them questioned her as they passed the bottle back and forth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda narrowed her eyes or tried to. They were already half closed from being heavily intoxicated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo this was all another set-up,‚Äù she gestured around, ‚Äúanother manipulation.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon shrugged, ‚ÄúWould you rather that or get completely wasted somewhere with zero security detail with no one looking out for you?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was drunk. She hated feeling like an overprotected child, but she was also reasonable. She knew what could have happened to her and Rio because of their recklessness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She also knew exactly what Lilia had been doing, so she wasn‚Äôt too angry. It was not so much manipulating as protecting, even if just from the sidelines. Just like Agatha did because she had learned from Lilia and Lorna.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, she wasn‚Äôt a child who needed protecting, but she tended to make chaotic decisions. She was entirely too drunk to think logically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, if she had consumed the amount of alcohol she thought she had, she would be dead. She looked back at Sharon, realizing that yes, she spoke with an accent and that she spoke in italics, but it wasn‚Äôt as bad as she had thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow much alcohol did we actually have?‚Äù Wanda asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon smiled genuinely.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve probably had half of what you think you did, and I gave you something to make sure you wouldn‚Äôt have a nasty hangover tomorrow. Rio had a fourth of what she thought she did. She doesn‚Äôt have your Eastern European tolerance. I‚Äôve also been watching her concussion. Neither of you is driving, though. I can drive you to the cabin and have one of my staff drive me back, or I can call you an Uber.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLeave it to Lilia. I still had a lot of fun. Thank you, Sharon. What about you, Ri?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned to Rio, who was lying across the bar, asleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda woke up to the early afternoon sun streaming in through the blinds. Whatever Sharon had given her, she felt fine. She was thankful she had showered before she fell into bed earlier and lay there remembering the events of the past few days. She was still hurt, yet was forming a better understanding, especially when looking at things from her mama bear point of view. An arm flopped across her stomach, and she froze. She didn‚Äôt remember going to sleep with anyone. She was both married and engaged. She did not need any more complications. Her eyes followed the arm up to find Rio‚Äôs face, and she relaxed. She then panicked again until she checked to see if they were both wearing pajamas. She reached over and shook Rio‚Äôs shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey, Rio, wake up. We‚Äôre getting tattooed in a few hours, and we should probably at least text the womenfolk.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio yawned. ‚ÄúWhat happened last night? Why are we in bed together?‚Äù She eyed Wanda suspiciously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBecause clearly, you came to your senses and chose the better one. Duh.‚Äù She exaggerated her facial expressions and grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNope. Your future wife terrifies me. Hard pass.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled and got out of the bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI think I came in here to talk, and we both fell asleep?‚Äù That was as much as she could remember, and Wanda agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda‚Äôs stomach growled. ‚ÄúDress, eat, tattoo, then maybe we call them?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs time we talk to those idiots.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt exactly handle things well, but ink therapy first,‚Äù Wanda confirmed, looking through her suitcase for something to wear.
     </span>
</p>

      It was Monday afternoon and Agatha was dying on the set. She still hadn‚Äôt talked to Wanda or Rio and didn‚Äôt know when they would be ready to do so. She had seen all the speculation online about the shenanigans of the night before and she and Nat were packed and ready to go at any moment. They had been texting Alice at school and she was also panicking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had been their voice of reason, reminding the three anxiety-riddled women to wait for Wanda and Rio to summon them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It had been a long time since Lilia had been Agatha‚Äôs voice of reason, and it was jarring.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Nat‚Äôs phones dinged at the same time, finally. Nat grabbed them and read them both while she waited for Agatha to finish her scene.

      Nat handed Agatha her phone with the Taylor Swift lyrics. She then showed her The Killers lyrics that Wanda had sent her. Agatha gave her a sweet smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe song you two got caught kissing to, that‚Äôs romantic. Wonder what Alice got?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As if on cue, Alice sent the screenshot of her text.

      Agatha looked at Nat. ‚ÄúShe can quote Beaches. I fucking love that movie.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat shook her head. ‚ÄúYou can fuck about it later, now come on.‚Äù

      Wanda handed over the chaos sigil she had doodled over to the tattoo artist. In her research, she learned that drawing your own chaos symbols held more meaning and power. Wanda had drawn inspiration from the chaos magick of their newest Marvel show and the brilliant costume designers, and how they infused symbology everywhere. Wanda looked back on her life and could see the chaos threads woven in, so why not create her own sigil powered with her intentions?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had drawn an angular letter W with an N overlaid. Each leg transformed into the arrows leading to the cardinal directions and imposing order onto the chaos. It was going on her ankle, and she liked it, love emerging from the chaos for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was far calmer than she would have expected at the tattoo parlor. Though she had considered a tattoo for years, she could not commit to anything that meant enough, or she didn‚Äôt think she would regret later. The moments from the last 30 years of death, destruction, and sadness that had fueled her previous tattoo designs that never materialized flashed through her mind. She took a pencil to paper and began to draw. ‚ÄúFrom death, comes life. And life, to death.‚Äù She muttered to herself as she erased a small portion.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put the pencil down. This was precisely what she wanted, meaning, design, and all. On the paper was the Egyptian eye of Horus, except where the pupil was supposed to be, was an ankh. It would be a small but powerful reminder on the inside of her wrist, right over her pulse point, that her life continued despite the death that surrounded her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They sent their messages, knowing it would take at least six hours for the other three women to join them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you ready for this?‚Äù Wanda was trying to hold her ankle still.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think either of us has a choice now.‚Äù Rio could only use one hand to talk and didn‚Äôt like it. ‚ÄúHonestly though, I‚Äôm more ready to talk to Alice than Agatha. She still hasn‚Äôt looked at the contents of that big envelope and I think she‚Äôs waiting to do it together, knowing her as well as I do.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAnd, as much as I love Agatha and truly want a life with her, I could live without her in my life if I had to, she‚Äôs only been in it for a short time. I do not want to do that, though. Alice? She is a permanent fixture, and it would kill me. I don‚Äôt see how Agatha did that as close as you say she and Lilia were. So I know things will be much easier with Alice. This was a big thing, but I know she had her reasons, and we‚Äôll be okay.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Everyone in the shop had been made to sign NDAs, brought over by Sharon with a quick smile and mouthing ‚ÄúLilia‚Äù to the women. At least Wanda and Rio weren‚Äôt worried about any secrets being leaked, though they still spoke vaguely. Wanda frowned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI completely understand that for you. I can‚Äôt lose either Nat or Agatha. I just got Nat back, and I‚Äôm not losing her again. I do think Agatha will be the hardest one for me as well. I do not see how L did this all those years ago when she lost Lilia, though. It would absolutely wreck me to lose Agatha, but Nat? It‚Äôs an impossible choice, but I know which one I would make, and that hurts.‚Äù Wanda had a pained expression as she looked past Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a choice you will ever have to make. You know you two will be okay, even if it‚Äôs a hard conversation. She‚Äôs the sister who raised you, loves you no matter what, and would sacrifice herself if it meant saving you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew that was all true. It‚Äôs what she would do for Alice. She and Alice had always said their partners would have to understand that it was a package deal.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI would do the same for her and Alice for you,‚Äù Wanda said softly as her artist, a young guy named Spin, wiped away a tear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you going to forgive Agatha?‚Äù Wanda asked, making eye contact.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a heavy sigh, she was bruised and sore from yesterday‚Äôs incident and didn‚Äôt notice the supposed pain from the tattoo needles.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI just need her to be honest, but, Wanda? I have never loved someone the way I love Agatha Harkness. Romantically. No, it hasn‚Äôt been very long, but she‚Äôs my person. So, yes, I‚Äôll forgive her. I‚Äôm not perfect either, but we need to get on the same page in every aspect.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stood up as Ghost, her artist, had finished. Wanda‚Äôs ink was complete as well. They completed their business and stepped back into the daylight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúReady to go wait for those three?‚Äù Wanda asked, gnawing at a fingernail.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMight as well,‚Äù Rio said, resigned to their fates.
     </span>

<span>
      Nat attempted to obey the speed limit as they headed to the cabin. Jen was not happy having to tell two different directors that their stars needed time. She also wasn‚Äôt excited about being put on teenage boy duty with Vision.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had a few upset teachers with Rio and Alice missing and handled them easily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gazed into the rearview mirror, which revealed the back of the vehicle. ‚ÄúWhen did you start a friendship with Lilia?‚Äù she asked Alice nonchalantly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAbout two or three years in, I think? Once I tested the waters and knew I could trust her. We had been work friends, but that‚Äôs when we really started to become closer. You had already taken me in, but I had learned a bit through Mom‚Äôs letters and decided it was time. Don‚Äôt worry, I never gave her too much information about you, and she didn‚Äôt ask.‚Äù Alice did not feel like this line of teenage girl conversation was useful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, I just wondered is all. I‚Äôm glad Lilia has had you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the deal with the chair?‚Äù Alice asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLilia‚Äôs always had a different chair in that corner. Then I walked in yesterday, and that purple, wingbacked armchair is there with you sprawled in it like the useless lesbian that you are, and you can just feel that it was specifically for you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice held Agatha‚Äôs gaze in the mirror.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve heard this story. I know it‚Äôs your chair, but I haven‚Äôt heard the story behind it. When you and Lilia had what we called your friendship breakup, it was replaced. I was surprised to see it back out.‚Äù Nat threw in.
     </span>

      Agatha hadn‚Äôt been inside Lilia‚Äôs house in nearly two decades and had no idea it had been removed. However, it didn‚Äôt surprise her. She smiled as she thought of the sixteen-year-old Agatha and her two much older guardians.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was sixteen and had won my court case. I sold my house and just about everything in it. Lorna bounced between men and either lived with them or Lilia so that she didn‚Äôt have to worry about losing a house and some of her hard-earned estate. I bought a condo and brand new everything. Lilia was keeping the house and would buy her current house a few years later, and Lorna decided to buy the condo next to mine. Anyway, Lilia needed a new chair for her house, and we stumbled into a cute little antique shop and came across that one. I fell in love with it but didn‚Äôt have a place to put it, and Lorna thought it was terrible. So Lilia bought it, saying it had an ' Old Crone‚Äô vibe. It quickly became my chair. I don‚Äôt know how much alcohol I spilled or how many burn marks I put on that thing. I carved our initials in the bottom when I was seventeen and bored,‚Äù She laughed. What she had actually carved was:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maiden Agatha
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Mother Lorna
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Crone Lilia
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe did know I was coming,‚Äù Agatha added, looking at both women.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDamnit, Agatha, you better not make her put that chair back up,‚Äù Nat warned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat pulled up and parked next to Rio‚Äôs SUV. The three of them sat there, gathering themselves for a moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this,‚Äù Agatha said resolutely as they unloaded themselves from the car, ready to face the consequences of their actions. As they trudged up the short walkway, the cabin door swung open, and Rio flew out. Agatha immediately stopped and opened her arms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMy love, I‚Äôm...‚Äù Her words died as Rio went past her, and she wrapped her arms around Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am so sorry! I should have told you.‚Äù Alice‚Äôs voice hit Agatha‚Äôs ears once she recovered from the snub.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat clapped her hand on Agatha‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúWell, we know where you stand,‚Äù Nat whispered with a mixed expression.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just smiled and nodded. ‚ÄúI wonder if this is what Lilia felt like when Lorna and I put each other before her,‚Äù she whispered sadly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat turned Agatha back to the door and walked toward Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWorse, I‚Äôm sure. Lilia and Lorna knew each other before you.‚Äù Nat shrugged and dropped her hand, walking into Wanda‚Äôs arms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha froze.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For the first time, she realized how much pain she must have caused Lorna.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had forced Lorna to choose between Lilia and herself. And Lorna had chosen Agatha, abandoning what was arguably the most important relationship in her life in her friendship with Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lorna had never mentioned it. Not while she was alive.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Not in her letters.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Never.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat had said something to Wanda, causing her to look at Agatha like an injured puppy. Agatha began to cry with her new revelation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There were few people in this world that she had tried to never bring pain to and Lorna Wu was one of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She couldn‚Äôt even apologize.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda‚Äôs arms were around her in seconds.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice and Rio were sitting at the kitchen table across from one another. Rio had been crying as she put the last of the letters down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe she wrote you ten letters and pre-dated them,‚Äù Rio said, wiping tears from her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThere are more. She wrote like she was running out of time, and she was. She must have started writing months before she died.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice ran her fingers over the first envelope.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lot of feelings, Alice. Why didn‚Äôt you tell me? And why haven‚Äôt you read that journal? She obviously wanted you to! She‚Äôs mentioned it in every letter, she knew you still wouldn‚Äôt have looked in it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew it would be hard to do, but it was something Alice was going to have to do eventually.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it with you when you're ready,‚Äù Rio said quietly, looking up through her lashes as she picked at her nailbeds. Alice looked at her, her face full of regret.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am so sorry. I should have told you, shown you these, something. You never grieved when your parents died, and I felt bad if I grieved in front of you, and then I felt so alone.‚Äù Alice looked away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thought back to all those years ago. She had lived with Alice and Gran since she was fourteen, for the most part. Her mom and stepdad never really noticed she was gone unless they needed her for something, and that was the only time she went back to their apartment. At one point, they had moved and hadn‚Äôt told her where they had gone. She found their new place three months later. When she did go back to them, she returned to Norma‚Äôs a few hours later, in terrible condition. She wasn‚Äôt sure how many times Norma had threatened them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So when they died, Rio didn‚Äôt feel anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The police officers had come to Norma‚Äôs house and asked for Rio. It was ruled a murder-suicide. She was seventeen. She had just looked at the officers and said, ‚ÄúThank you, is that all?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Norma disappeared to make a phone call, and Rio asked Alice if she wanted to go back to studying for their first test of senior year.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned back to Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI grieved Norma. I was devastated when she died and you disappeared. I didn‚Äôt grieve my mother because she hadn‚Äôt been my mother since I was six. Gran was my mother. I don‚Äôt even remember the guy she was married to. Alice, you met them, they were horrible. I grieved the loss of my mother once she lost herself in her addiction. Lorna never lost herself, and she beat it.‚Äù
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
      She shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to fight or argue with you. It was hard enough being mad at you. I finally joined you out here after ten years, and I am so thankful I did. I understand I wasn‚Äôt here to share everything with, but I still shared every single damn thing with you.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI understand you signed pieces of paper. I get it. But Alice, so did I, and I still told you about that blonde bitch. I even told her I was going to. I know you‚Äôre a rule follower, but it‚Äôs me. You know I wasn‚Äôt going to say anything to anyone other than Raven, and she doesn‚Äôt count.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wrapped her arms around herself. Wincing as she grazed a bruise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know, and every time I said something about it, Lilia would just remind me that she and Lorna never let NDAs stand in the way of telling each other everything. Then it just got to where I felt it was too late. Right before you moved out here, she told me she would give me the school year to tell you and that if I didn‚Äôt, she would.‚Äù Alice stared down at the table as she pulled at the hem of her sleeve.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWait, what? Why would she tell me?‚Äù Rio was confused. Why did Lilia feel like she needed to give Alice an ultimatum? Alice sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe said sisters shouldn‚Äôt separate themselves and lead double lives, that someone hurts the other.‚Äù Alice popped her head up and looked across the table. ‚ÄúMother fucker!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, but we can come back to that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, she was warning me about becoming her! The way she hurt my mom and Agatha!‚Äù Alice was tired of having life-changing revelations, but she was also understanding a lot more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDamnit Rio. That‚Äôs what I was doing. I was closer to Lilia than I let on, closer to Agatha and everyone, and had Jen and confided in her. I was living this whole other life and justifying it with the law when I should have roped you in.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo, you admit that you were wrong, you‚Äôre going to be honest with me, we‚Äôll read the journal, and we‚Äôre okay?‚Äù Rio summed everything up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something else‚Ä¶‚Äù Alice continued.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio slouched and sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was jealous of Agatha. Yes, I wanted, and I want, you to be happy. Yet the jealousy I had when I found out how close Agatha was to Mom? It returned when you started spending so much time with Agatha.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled. ‚ÄúThen why didn‚Äôt you tell me, idiot? I will always make time for you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice‚Äôs cheeks turned pink. ‚ÄúBecause I was spending a lot of time with Jen in an official dating capacity.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio found that she really couldn‚Äôt be mad at Alice, and she never could be. Had it hurt that Alice had kept something so major and important from her? Yes. She understood why Alice had done it, though, and she wouldn‚Äôt hold it against her. Alice wasn‚Äôt just her best friend. She was the sister the universe had given to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put her elbow on the table between them and stuck her pinky out like she had done so many times since they had become friends when they were twelve.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPromise me that we will never keep secrets from each other again, no matter what we have signed. We will always be open about our emotions and feelings, and we‚Äôll tackle the envelope when you‚Äôre ready.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio said, staring Alice down. Alice joined her pinky with Rio‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOn the graves of Lorna and Norma Wu, I pinky swear.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They squeezed each other‚Äôs pinkies before letting loose a fit of giggles.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIf you children are done, then come in here,‚Äù Nat called from the other room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice tried to look at Rio seriously. ‚ÄúTime for the boss fight.‚Äù They both started giggling again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Alice had walked off into the kitchen for their chat while Wanda, Nat, and Agatha remained in the living room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had been nervous the entire drive and wanted to make sure everything was right between Wanda and Nat before anything else. Nerves pushed her to speak quickly, uncertain of how long they had before Rio and Alice returned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAngel, don‚Äôt be mad at Natasha, please. It was my fault. When she came and told me what she found that day, I immediately told her not to tell you. I didn‚Äôt tell her exactly why, just to trust me. That if you ever found out, I would take care of it. None of this is on her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was sitting cross-legged on the couch, arms wrapped around her stomach as if she were trying to hold herself together. She was trying to keep herself and her world from falling apart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was tired of crying, and she knew everyone else in this house was too. Yet, she felt the all-too-familiar sting at the edges of her eyes creeping up on her. She knew Agatha was trying to protect them, she always was, but she needed confirmation of something.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, why didn‚Äôt you want to tell me?‚Äù Wanda barely spoke above a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew she had to be honest, and she hated it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWanda, everyone knows you can‚Äôt keep a secret.‚Äù Agatha looked at her as if saying the words caused her pain. Wanda recoiled as if Agatha had slapped her. She closed her eyes as a tear slid out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha,‚Äù Wanda‚Äôs voice wavered. ‚ÄúWhen have I EVER let one of YOUR secrets slip to anyone that wasn‚Äôt Nat?‚Äù Wanda‚Äôs voice trembled as she blinked her eyes open, trying to fight back the tears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha furrowed her brows as she thought about it before it hit her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNever.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was not the best at keeping secrets, but when it came to Agatha? She only told Nat. Wanda had once told Agatha that she could trust her with anything. She had meant it with her entire being.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot. Once.‚Äù Wanda replied, voice hardening.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned her head sharply, looking at Nat. ‚ÄúYou knew that! Just like with you! I tell the two of you everything, yes, so I can get it out, but that‚Äôs it. All other secrets are fair game. The two of you? Absolutely not.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, you are my best friend, my big sister, the person who will and has done anything and everything for me. I share almost everything with you. I would never do anything to hurt you, and then you betrayed me. I know it‚Äôs how we grew up and how we were raised, but it‚Äôs up to us to change that. To stop it. It‚Äôs not going to be easy, Agatha, but how many more of us do you have to hurt to realize what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù Wanda was pleading for Agatha to hear her. Agatha had her hand to her mouth, genuinely listening to what Wanda was saying. Wanda had never spilled one of Agatha‚Äôs secrets, yet she had been adamant about not sharing with her. She had betrayed and hurt Wanda. Keeping things from her and causing herself to deal with so much pain on her own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was so goodhearted. So many bad things had happened to her, yet she still saw and found the good in life and people. Still defended Agatha no matter what she did. Bad ‚Äòboy‚Äô Agatha Harkness and girl-next-door Wanda Maximoff. Sure, Hollywood had played off of their dynamic for decades, and it was a classic buddy comedy trope, but it worked for them. She knew that the past really would have been different if she had taken the kid gloves off earlier and shared more with her earlier.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up and locked eyes with Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked shocked. ‚ÄúSomeone record this.‚Äù She said, genuinely surprised at the omission.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI mean it, Wanda. I did become two separate people, and I hate it. I have been doing a lot of thinking. I do need Lilia back, we all do, and she and I have done a lot of talking already.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe brought the chair back out,‚Äù Nat interrupted. She had moved to Wanda‚Äôs side and was holding her hand. Wanda had allowed it and smiled. They would be perfectly okay.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know she had put it up, obviously. It was there when I went over late Saturday Night, early Sunday Morning. Anyway, I don‚Äôt want to be that person anymore, and I‚Äôm working on it. You all deserve better. Our sons deserve better. Alice deserves better, Rio, that beautiful woman who has somehow not run away screaming, my future if she‚Äôll still have me? Deserves the world. I‚Äôm lucky enough to have people around me who care and will call me on my shit, I fucking love you, Wanda. I am so sorry for being overprotective, and I will step back. I can‚Äôt promise to never be a little too overprotective, but I‚Äôll work on it. I‚Äôm also working on the whole secrecy thing. I know sorry isn‚Äôt enough, but I am so sorry, kid.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had stood at some point to walk and gesture while she talked. She had come to a stop, hands stopped mid-gesture.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh! And please forgive Nat. She wanted to tell you she loves you more than anything, and I saw her full-body sob, and it was absolutely heartbreaking and terrifying, frankly.‚Äù Agatha added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda turned her head to look at Nat, ‚ÄúYou full-body sobbed? Why, my love?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat brushed Wanda‚Äôs hair behind her ear and locked eyes with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the sunshine in my day, Wanda. Do you know what happens to Russian assassins when they fail a mission and are compromised? They‚Äôre permanently retired. I saw you and immediately risked it all. The shady bitch over there pulled some major strings for everything to work out the way it did because she saw something spark between us. I‚Äôve loved you since we were eighteen in a back alley, Wanda, as sappy and awful as that sounds. To lose you a second time after finally being able to have you fully? I couldn‚Äôt handle it. So yes, for the second time in my life, I was full-body sobbing on Lilia Calderu‚Äôs couch as Lilia held me. Before you ask, the first time was in the same spot, with the same woman, plus Lorna, because I thought I was losing you the first time.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat was caressing Wanda‚Äôs cheek. She had never told Wanda that she had struggled with the thought of losing her when Wanda fell for Vision. Agatha stood there listening to Nat, wiping tears away from the corners of her eyes. She would never forget that night. She knew exactly what would happen to Nat after Agatha escaped their encounter unscathed. Thankfully, Agatha knew a guy, or, well, Lilia knew a guy. That was also how the deal was made involving Agatha‚Äôs mother, and they had themselves a Nat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was fully crying as she leaned forward and kissed her fianc√©e.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt took me two years to figure out how I felt about you. I had you for five years before I married Vision, and then I was at arm‚Äôs length for twenty. We are getting married in a few months, Natasha. I am not losing you over a secret my stupid sister made you keep, okay?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat nodded, sniffling slightly. ‚ÄúOkay. Te iubesc.‚Äù Nat leaned forward and kissed her again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda grinned. ‚ÄúYa tebya lyublyu.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wiped away more tears. When had she become so sentimental?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHi, stupid sister here. Am I forgiven?‚Äù she asked, knowing she probably was, but asking anyway.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGet over here,‚Äù Wanda waved her arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sat next to Wanda and hugged her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, honey. I didn‚Äôt even realize what I‚Äôd been doing.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda tucked Agatha‚Äôs head under her chin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAggie, I fucking love you too. Stop lying to your therapist and authentically work on the things you need to work on. That woman in there wants you to be her future, and I want that for both of you. I also want a niece, and you‚Äôre getting old.‚Äù Wanda smiled as Agatha pulled back to glare. ‚ÄúYou have to start being honest with us and stop telling half-truths. I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs perfect. She‚Äôs not, but she‚Äôs perfect for you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They turned toward the kitchen as the sound of giggling floated in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLooks like you‚Äôre up, slugger,‚Äù Wanda said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIf you children are done, then come in here,‚Äù Nat called.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Alice walked in, leaning against each other and laughing over something. Rio‚Äôs laughter immediately died upon seeing Agatha. She hadn‚Äôt stopped because she was still angry, she was fighting her instincts to run to her and tell her all was forgiven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, they needed to genuinely talk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pulled away from Wanda as Wanda and Nat stood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAlice, come with us, we‚Äôre going to play pool.‚Äù Wanda gave Alice a look that told her she didn‚Äôt have a choice, so they left the room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Agatha, hugging herself, the look of hurt she had worn so many times over the last forty-eight hours returning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stood up, walking to Rio. She reached out and lightly placed her hands on her arms, waiting for resistance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was none.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stepped into Agatha, letting Agatha wrap her arms around her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI understand you‚Äôre angry,‚Äù Agatha started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not angry,‚Äù Rio murmured. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hurt, Agatha.‚Äù She stepped out of the embrace and took a seat, still hugging herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI accepted that your ex was someone you occasionally worked with, someone I might meet in passing, someone in your orbit. But finding out it‚Äôs Lilia? That‚Äôs really something I needed to know. I know you didn‚Äôt want to change how I saw her, but Agatha. Don‚Äôt you think I would have found out eventually? What was going to happen the longer this went on? It would have been even worse. The lies, the omissions, they have to stop.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen, I need you to start telling me more about the past. I had no idea just how involved Lorna and Lilia were in your life. I just read ten letters to Alice from Lorna. Lorna telling Alice to give you a chance, to form a relationship with Lilia. Aside from Alice and Norma, you and Lilia were the best parts of her life, and you and Lilia convinced her to keep Alice. Thank you for that, by the way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt was just so much. I know I don‚Äôt need to know everything, but it also explains a lot about why you and Nicky get away with murder. Plus, she‚Äôs my boss, and I trusted her. I was forming a friendship with her. I respected her, Agatha!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs thoughts were everywhere, and the more she looked at Agatha, the more she wanted to kiss her and have Agatha tell her everything was okay. Agatha sat beside her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, and yes, I‚Äôll record it for you if you want me to. Wanda and Nat gave me that same look. You have every reason to be hurt and I should have told you who it was, as it does have a major effect on our lives. You can still have a friendship with her and respect her, Rio. I understand the emotions are very conflicting right now, but you‚Äôve read the letters and know how big a part of my life she played, other than that. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time over there the past forty-eight hours, and fences are being mended. If you‚Äôre not okay with that, then I‚Äôll stay at arm‚Äôs length.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about that right now. This is about us. Rio, I want there to be an us. For a very long time, and for that to work, we have to be open and honest with each other, I agree. Wanda says I have to stop lying to my therapist and start working on some other things.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWanda‚Äôs right,‚Äù Rio interjected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe has an uncanny ability for that.‚Äù Agatha smiled. ‚ÄúRio, I don‚Äôt want to fight, and I don‚Äôt want to argue. Over the past few days, I realized that I also became two separate people, like Lilia did. I know I need to work on myself, and I plan on doing that. I also know we need to work on our communication. I don‚Äôt want to watch Heartbreak Karaoke featuring you and Wanda on a grainy live stream every time we don‚Äôt communicate. However, it was highly entertaining, and now I do want to go to karaoke with you.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI digress. I want you to read the letters I have from Lorna. I want to be more open with you, and I want you to be more open with me. I love you, and I want this to work, whatever it takes.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had never been much of a crier off-screen, yet these past few months had been brutal, and she blamed menopause. Rio huffed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow do you do that? Completely disarm me to where I can‚Äôt be mad at you if I wanted to be? I‚Äôm still slightly wounded, but not nearly as much as I should be.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked. ‚ÄúI came by it honestly.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had done the same thing to Rio that Lilia had done to her. She hadn‚Äôt meant to, it just happened. Now that she thought about it, Lorna had the same ability.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have a feeling you learned it from the women who raised you.‚Äù Rio‚Äôs eyes narrowed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI learned a lot from them. They raised me. Back to us, I know we still have some things to work out and work through, as well as relationship dynamics to navigate. Are we okay for now while we build this to what we want it to be?‚Äù Agatha cupped Rio‚Äôs cheek and caressed it with her thumb.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha Harkness, where is this coming from all of a sudden?‚Äù Rio was slightly taken aback at the sudden relationship skills her girlfriend had.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWould you believe me if I said my son?‚Äù Agatha winced slightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, actually.‚Äù Rio was not surprised in the slightest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHe recommended a podcast. The advice was not from him,‚Äù Agatha clarified.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm slightly disappointed in our son now,‚Äù Rio smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled at hearing Rio saying ‚Äòour son‚Äô again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIn case you hadn‚Äôt gathered, we‚Äôre okay for now. I love you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned in and kissed her, running a hand through Agatha‚Äôs hair. She could work with this. They could work through these things and navigate whatever came at them. Agatha placed her hand on the back of Rio‚Äôs head, only for Rio to hiss in pain and pull back. Her head was still tender, and the Tylenol from earlier was wearing off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her, worried. Why was she hurt?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Her eyes scanned over Rio, noticing a few light bruises.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI flew off of a snowmobile yesterday,‚Äù Rio admitted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat? Why didn‚Äôt you tell me? Wait, why were you drinking last night? We need to get you checked out, baby. I am so sorry. Does anything feel broken?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs mind was racing. Rio had gotten injured almost a year after the last time she had been seriously injured. Rio started to laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAggie, I‚Äôm fine. I have a mild concussion, and I‚Äôm banged up. We went to the first aid station. Very nice woman.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was still looking at her in horror. ‚ÄúI saw you on live streams! You were completely plastered! That‚Äôs not good!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda walked back in upon hearing Agatha panicking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe were at Sharon Davis-Hart‚Äôs bar, Agatha. Remember her? Anyway, she did a good job of making us think we were drunker than we were. She kept an eye on Rio and made sure she was fine.‚Äù Wanda sat on a couch catty-corner to the one Agatha and Rio were on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLilia,‚Äù Agatha stated. ‚ÄúOf course, she called Sharon. Well, still, that means it‚Äôs time for you to go to bed and rest your head.‚Äù Agatha was still concerned. She had read several studies and articles from medical journals about concussions when Nicky started playing football and did not play around with head injuries. Agatha helped Rio up, and they said their goodnights, walking up to Agatha‚Äôs old room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat and Alice had taken their bags up to their rooms. Agatha stepped into the room and passed echoes of herself through the ages. Teenage Agatha getting ready to go skiing, teenage Agatha making out with someone, teenage Agatha dancing around with Lorna and Lilia, young adult Agatha with a broken leg, laughing with Wanda, young adult Agatha dancing around and drinking with Wanda, Nat, Lilia, and Lorna.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had seen these memories playing out like old film reels downstairs, but she hadn‚Äôt expected it as much here. They all faded away when she realized Rio was in front of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, are you okay?‚Äù Rio asked, wrapping her arms around Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, just remembering the times I spent here is all. And, at least the room‚Äôs decor has been updated. I was serious about sleep and no strenuous activities.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio pouted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha got right next to Rio‚Äôs ear, her breath hot. ‚ÄúOnce you‚Äôre cleared, we can be as
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       strenuous
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      as you want,‚Äù she purred before stepping back to change for bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tuesday morning had begun with Jen calling Agatha to get all of them to the nearest TV in the next fifteen minutes. She woke Rio and pounded on two bedroom doors. Ten minutes later, they were waiting for the news as Jen had instructed. Coffee was brewing in the background and they would eat after they watched whatever it was they were supposed to watch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Breaking news music played, and the graphic flashed across the screen as the announcer came on the screen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<em>
       ‚ÄúLou Falco, famed supermodel and ex-wife of former NFL quarterback Shane Falco was found deceased at the infamous Island psychiatric prison complex early this morning‚Ä¶‚Äù
      </em>
</b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She didn‚Äôt know if someone had muted the TV, but Rio didn‚Äôt hear another word, and her body numbed at the words. She wasn‚Äôt sure how to feel. She didn‚Äôt want to be happy that someone was dead, but she was relieved to know she was finally safe, and that slightly concerned her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was how she felt when her parents died. However, back then, she was very young. That she didn‚Äôt find it concerning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The touch of Wanda‚Äôs hand brought Rio out of her spiraling thoughts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make you an awful person to feel safe,‚Äù Wanda said, leaning over the couch and rubbing Rio‚Äôs arms. ‚ÄúIt makes you human, and that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI just... three kids lost their mother,‚Äù Rio said, voice barely above a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice reached out and put her hand on Rio‚Äôs knee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRi, those babies haven‚Äôt had a mother in years. You even told me that when the oldest left for college, she went no contact and only talked to you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded as Agatha sat beside her and wrapped her arms around her, kissing her cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI love you. You‚Äôre one of the strongest women I know, and I am here for whatever you need.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew she was surrounded by love, and yet again, it was comforting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was definitely time to get back to therapy, though.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was projecting all the warmth she could onto Rio. Inside, she had chilled to the core. Jen had known, what else had been set into motion? Agatha thought of the Russian assassin. She wasn‚Äôt sure how or when Nat had done it, possibly pulling some strings and making some calls. She never questioned Nat‚Äôs methods in all of these years, she was just glad everyone was safe. But, the ruthlessness and reach sometimes surprised her, and Agatha worked to keep it all to herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat continued to read the words that were scrolling across the screen. She had sent a few details here and there, but just like always, she hadn‚Äôt done the dirty work. Not enough to get into any serious legal trouble.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She hadn‚Äôt gotten her hands bloody in that way since Agatha had made her a part of their ragtag family twenty-seven years ago. Fights, framing, blackmail, and threats to make people disappear. Yet, she was never the one who followed through on that, and the women always dismissed her denials as necessary theater and plausible deniability. But Nat knew that was untrue.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Someone else just always got there first.

      Hours after the news broke, Rio sat on the couch, scrolling through social media. The internet was buzzing with news that Agatha and Wanda were not at their respective sets, videos of drunken, angry karaoke, pictures of someone that looked like Rio coming out of the small clinic on the mountain, and just pictures of WandRio in general.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were sticking with the nickname to everyone's annoyance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice had been texting back and forth with Jen all Tuesday morning, especially after the news of Lou‚Äôs demise had broken. Jen was trying to make sure no connections were made. She had already intercepted a picture of Rio from the previous school, coaching one of Lou‚Äôs daughters, hoping nothing else leaked. Combined with speculation from the internet, Jen was trying to put out fires everywhere and was drafting a statement to put out just in case.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The news had said that the supermodel succumbed to natural causes, and an autopsy would be performed. The woman had only been fifty-five, and Rio wondered what natural causes people would believe. She tried to focus on her mindless scrolling and read various things about her and her friends.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I hope Rio is okay after whatever happened while they were snowmobiling!

      Rio made a mental note to check just how much information was on the internet and out there for the public. Maybe she could talk to Jen about that. She looked at what was currently trending, and her stomach flipped.

       Please! At that place? At 55? She was murdered!
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Oh please. I doubt it. Don‚Äôt be disrespectful with your conspiracy theories!
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio paused. It‚Äôs what she had been worried about. There were always conspiracy theories when these things happened, especially when high-profile people died while incarcerated in any type of way. This was not good, and while their relationship had been buried and those directly around the woman had signed NDAs, the school itself had not required them as SHIELD did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This did not bode well for anyone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy do people keep saying nice things about this horrid woman?‚Äù Nat spat, tossing down her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúCan you wipe it all?‚Äù Wanda looked up at her from where she was lying in her lap. The two had been even more tactile than usual since apologizing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat smiled down at her future wife, ‚ÄúNo, iubirea mea, that would look highly suspicious. Plus, that would be more of a Darcy-level task.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo? I‚Äôm sure everyone would blame the ex-husband.‚Äù Wanda‚Äôs gaze traveled to Rio. ‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTrying not to vomit. I‚Äôm going to stay off social media for a few days. I can‚Äôt handle all of this, and my head still hurts. I wonder if Sharon will write a note so I can say this was mandated time off.‚Äù Rio wondered out loud, her head still throbbing, though she didn‚Äôt like to admit it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe already did, though Lilia had no problem with you taking time in the first place.‚Äù Agatha walked into the room and took a seat next to Rio. Agatha handed her the next dose of pain meds, and Rio took them gratefully, curling into Agatha after swallowing them with water.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice had been on the other side of Rio and sighed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for Lilia. It‚Äôs so the Fencing Club doesn‚Äôt bully her about being the principal‚Äôs pet because she‚Äôs sleeping with you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha, Wanda, and Nat all turned to look at Alice with shocked expressions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was the first to speak. ‚ÄúWhat? How do you know about the fencing club?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBecause I work there and have ears, Agatha. It‚Äôs not all of them, obviously, but it‚Äôs led by one or two of the more jealous types. Then the sorry bitches who just tag along to be cool and enjoy the commiseration of being among the many rejected by THE Agatha Harkness. Lilia can‚Äôt just fire them, though she wants to. Several teachers, other than myself, have come to her defense, notably Rogers and Carter.‚Äù Alice‚Äôs frown deepened. ‚ÄúLilia won‚Äôt let me punch the smirks off their faces.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you in high school or teaching high school?‚Äù Nat‚Äôs eyebrows formed a question mark.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed dryly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same thing. English departments are the absolute worst, though. High School teachers are just as clique-ish as the kids.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo all of the women you slept with at SHIELD call themselves the fencing club after your tattoo?‚Äù Wanda asked incredulously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs high school for you,‚Äù Agatha confirmed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am so glad that part of your life is over. One less thing for Jen to worry about.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda had repositioned herself and was now leaning her head against Nat‚Äôs shoulder, her legs draped over Nat‚Äôs lap, with Nat absentmindedly running her hand up and down Wanda‚Äôs back, looking at Wanda like she was the only woman that existed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Seeing the two of them in this state, Agatha would never know that Nat had been somehow responsible for handing out consequences to some very terrible people over the years. It still blew Agatha‚Äôs mind how Nat could compartmentalize so well and easily slip back into that role.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat‚Äôs insistence that she hadn‚Äôt been the cause of all those unfortunate events was starting to wear at Agatha‚Äôs assurance that it was Nat. Something had started to poke at her mind and memories, and it was something she would have to explore later. Right now, Agatha was focused on her happiness for Wanda and relief that Wanda had been more upset than angry.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSpeaking of my‚Ä¶our incredible fixer,‚Äù Agatha started and winced. The words ‚Äòfuture sister-in-law‚Äô had threatened to spill out, but she had thankfully been able to stop them. Seeing the smirk on Wanda‚Äôs face, however, told her that someone had noticed. Had she really begun to think of Alice as her sister by proxy of Rio?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúJen has had to handle several things already. It doesn‚Äôt look good when you leave a set and don‚Äôt come back or don‚Äôt show up to one.‚Äù Agatha cut her eyes to Wanda. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also the speculation about the weekend shenanigans, my son‚Äôs posts about catsitting Raven, as the cat has a cult following, Vision was pictured on a date with Herb, and then she‚Äôs having to closely monitor any leaks about any connection to the wicked witch. It‚Äôs too late in the afternoon to drive back today, but we have to head back tomorrow and get back to everything. Alice just got married. We can‚Äôt make her a widow already because Jen had a heart attack.‚Äù Agatha smiled over Rio‚Äôs head at Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúJust make sure Jen gets a decent Christmas bonus,‚Äù Alice responded, shaking her head as she texted calming affirmations to her wife, who was currently ranting about the disease that was social media.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúConsider your house paid for,‚Äù Agatha countered, nonverbally discussing it with Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was joking.‚Äù Alice rolled her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not,‚Äù Wanda added. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt put her through this much in a while, and if anyone does make the Rio/Super Psycho connection, it‚Äôs going to get worse.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had dozed off, leaning against Agatha. She knew that some of this was her fault. She hadn‚Äôt communicated, hadn‚Äôt talked rationally about anything, just grabbed Wanda and ran away. She was also the reason for the SF complication. Well, that was partly Lilia, wasn‚Äôt it? She had brought her out here after all. Hadn‚Äôt she?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her head was swimming, and she was tired. It was mid-afternoon. They could go back now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat up and yawned. ‚ÄúWe could go back now,‚Äù She said groggily, stretching her arms above her head. It was Nat who spoke first.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, the damage has been done, and while it‚Äôs not that late, it will look better if we stay a bit longer in case the connection is made. It would be good for us to be seen around town this evening.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat spoke from experience, and while people wouldn‚Äôt necessarily suspect Agatha or any of their family if any of the stalking or connections came to light, it would still be better to establish alibis. As it was, Nat wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they were questioned depending on the autopsy reports. Nat hadn‚Äôt spoken with Shane and didn‚Äôt know who had pulled off the hit. The restraining order and court appearance were enough that if Nat were a detective on the case, she would come sniffing around asking questions of the coven at least. Nat began to wonder if there was something or someone else at play. This wasn‚Äôt the first time that Nat had this nagging suspicion. To this day, she hadn‚Äôt figured out what befell the stalker who came after Wanda and the boys all those years ago. While Nat had let almost everyone assume it had been her doing, she had been clear with Wanda that that wasn‚Äôt a Nat operation. Still, no one asked questions and the event just faded into the background.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI agree with redheaded demon number two,‚Äù Agatha was saying. ‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù Agatha looked at Rio, worried.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to take an actual nap if that‚Äôs okay. Sorry.‚Äù Rio yawned. Although her head hurt, this did not feel at all like the concussion from last year. Rio reluctantly agreed with Agatha and conceded to a nap.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAs long as most of us are seen, it should be okay.‚Äù Agatha nodded, forehead wrinkled with worry. She looked over at Alice. ‚ÄúAre you coming, Mrs. Wu? Or is it Mrs. Kale?‚Äù She asked with a smile. Lorna would have been so happy for all of them, and Agatha had to swallow the lump in her throat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No one had called her Mrs. yet, let alone asked which last name she was taking. Alice felt her cheeks redden as she sunk into the couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt settled on last names yet and may just keep ours. We thought of hyphenating, but both Wu-Kale and Kale-Wu sounded off to us, and I really want to keep Wu. I‚Äôll drop Gulliver, but I‚Äôm not losing Wu,‚Äù Alice and Jen had done this back and forth for almost three months now. Jen didn‚Äôt want to lose Kale for business reasons, and Alice had finally started feeling a connection to what her last name truly meant. They had their disagreements, but this had been the longest-running one.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPlease go with Wu-Kale and adopt a few dogs so I can call them the Wu-Kale clan,‚Äù Rio looked at her with pleading eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice failed to suppress her laugh. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not, Method Man, go to bed.‚Äù She looked at Agatha. ‚ÄúAs for the original question, I think I‚Äôll stay here and keep an eye on this one.‚Äù She pointed at Rio, who was standing to go upstairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Rio grabbed Alice‚Äôs hand and tugged. ‚ÄúCome tell me about the decade of your life I wasn‚Äôt here for,‚Äô‚Äô Rio bent back down to give Agatha a quick kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPlease be very careful. You don‚Äôt have a full security detail. Don‚Äôt do anything Wanda and I would do. Te amo.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned quickly and disappeared upstairs with Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha watched her go and groaned. ‚ÄúThat woman is going to be the death of me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen swore out loud as she hung up the phone and put her head in her hands, leaning back in her office chair. They were a few days away from the big move and her office provided the calm she needed, whereas the apartment was a mess of boxes and bubble wrap.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had completed damage control with two separate directors. One for Agatha‚Äôs TV show, and the other for Wanda‚Äôs movie. They had both continued filming scenes that didn‚Äôt include the two stars, and as long as they were at their respective studios on Thursday morning, everything would be fine. Wanda‚Äôs director, Maxwell, understood immediately and was very understanding. Wanda didn‚Äôt disappear or pull stunts. That was always Agatha‚Äôs department. Agatha‚Äôs director, Dottie, had been miffed, but once Jen explained that it was a matter of love, she softened.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen knew everyone‚Äôs weaknesses.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, it was not the directors that had Jen exasperated and anxious. It was Disney and Marvel. Fittings and table reads were scheduled to start soon, and they were not happy with two of their stars splashed all over the internet. Especially when their very wholesome star was now very suggestively participating in drunken karaoke.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, this was not good, and Jen had to do some serious explaining. Thankfully, just mentioning a particular lawyer‚Äôs name was enough, but Jen certainly did not want to call him. Team Wagatha had a team of lawyers. There were the lawyers for the more mundane things like Wanda‚Äôs divorce, contract negotiations, real estate, and NDAs. Then, they had their very special lawyer. Jen was certain the man was ageless. He kept everyone out of prison, dealt with anything that could go awry, such as breach of contracts, and expedited citizenships. He was the kind of lawyer that people were afraid of because he wasn‚Äôt crooked. He was just that good and terrifying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The minute Jen said, ‚ÄúI can always send their contracts over to their legal team. I‚Äôm sure the head of their team, Mr. Fury, would be happy to speak to you,‚Äù The executive on the other end of the line had gone silent. Breathing was the only thing Jen heard. ‚ÄúOh? So you have heard of him? I can have,‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The executive cut her off. ‚ÄúNo, Mrs. Kale, that won‚Äôt be necessary. Just make sure your clients are where they need to be when they need to be there.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The line had gone dead immediately.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Now, Jen had to let Fury know, and she did not want to contact him. Contacting him about these types of things showed weakness, and she hated that. She reached for her phone and opted to text.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

      Me:

<span>
      to Disney/Marvel. It
     </span>

<span>
      Before now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      You looked beautiful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen inhaled sharply. She hadn‚Äôt seen him at the reception though that didn‚Äôt mean he hadn‚Äôt been there. He was friends with Tony, another client. Tony had probably told him as he was one of the few people who knew of her connection with the powerful attorney.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

      Me:

      love and care for you.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen made a mental note to put her walls back in place and interrogate Alice. Love had made her too soft. She was finished with this conversation, and she knew the longer she stayed here, the likelier it was for him to track her location and show up. Just because they had set boundaries didn‚Äôt mean he wouldn‚Äôt cross them. She slipped her laptop into her bag, turned off the lights, and locked up. Once in her car, she rechecked her phone just to see if Fury had gotten the hint that she was finished talking with him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He had not.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Man:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She‚Äôs a great girl, Jennifer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I knew her mother.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Me:
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>

     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It‚Äôs part of why I
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      have this job.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha told her otherwise constantly, though Jen knew that in the beginning, his connection to this particular trio was precisely what landed her the job. Hollywood was filled with nepotism in all industries, and she hated being one of them, even if only a small number of people knew. She knew that Agatha wouldn‚Äôt take just anyone to be her sole representation for everything, but she still did everything she could and worked as hard as she could to prove to Agatha that she was more than her genetic makeup.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was also why she had been so insistent on not dating Alice. She didn‚Äôt want Fury to take credit for everything she had in her life. She tossed her phone into the passenger seat and drove back to the apartment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He‚Äôd probably take credit for the house on the compound, too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

<span>
      I mean it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen sat on the couch in the apartment, surrounded by boxes. She couldn‚Äôt wait to get everything into the new house on Saturday. The last message had irritated her. Where was that the last forty years? No. She didn‚Äôt have time for this. She was done with this conversation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She pulled out her laptop and began working on a statement for People.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sat in a booth at Sharon‚Äôs bar, drinking water, knowing that this wasn‚Äôt the time for alcohol, reaffirmed by the all-knowing look from Wanda as the thought crossed Agath‚Äôas mind. They had eaten dinner, wandered the area, and been highly visible. The way her notifications were going off told her it was working.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHave you two set a date?‚Äù Agatha asked, trying to be happy for them but completely focused on her relationship.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot yet. The divorce isn‚Äôt finalized until June twenty-sixth,‚Äù Nat answered, drinking some type of stout.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe wedding is June twenty-eighth,‚Äù Wanda said decidedly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the last Saturday of Pride. We can make sure to be home from filming for a few days. I‚Äôve already checked the filming schedules and with the director. We‚Äôll have a small wedding. I was thinking of either the beach house or the compound.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For once, Nat had nothing to say. She just sat there slack-jawed and stunned. This was a side of Wanda she hadn‚Äôt seen. Her first wedding to Vis had been a production, and Wanda had been indecisive about every little detail, down to her shoes. Nat looked at Agatha, who seemed more attentive now, before turning to her equal half and putting her hand on Wanda‚Äôs knee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy the rush?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked down at her hands where she was picking at her cuticles, an old habit she occasionally reverted to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWith the recent revelations and my self-reflections, I don‚Äôt want to spend any more time as anything but your wife, Nat. Girlfriend, partner, fianc√©e, that‚Äôs not what I want to be. I‚Äôm more sure about this than I was about having kids. There are still days I‚Äôm not so sure about them.‚Äù She turned and smirked at Nat. ‚ÄúBesides, what better way to end Pride month than with a lesbian wedding?‚Äù Wanda leaned over and quickly pressed her lips against Nat‚Äôs in a chaste kiss. ‚ÄúPlease?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat pressed her forehead against Wanda‚Äôs. ‚ÄúI will never tire of hearing you refer to yourself as my wife, and we‚Äôre not even married yet. Yes, June twenty-eighth, whenever and wherever you want.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat kissed Wanda again, sliding her hand into Wanda‚Äôs hair to deepen the kiss. Agatha loudly cleared her throat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey kids, this is a very public bar, and your pictures and videos are already being posted on the internet. I already have two texts from Jen that say, ‚ÄúOh God, make it stop,‚Äô and ‚Äòkill them now‚Äô‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda finally pulled back, laughing. ‚ÄúTell Jen it‚Äôs my turn to be a menace.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pressed stop and sent the video. ‚ÄúYou told her yourself.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stuck her tongue out and did a little dance on her side of the booth as if bragging. Wanda just shook her head. She was glad that they were acting like them again. She took a drink of the fruity concoction the bartender had made for her before looking back at her sister.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo when are you proposing?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha choked on air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúExcuse me? It hasn‚Äôt even been a year!‚Äù Agatha exclaimed after she recovered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shrugged. ‚ÄúOkay, and? Get it together, Harkness.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot happening. I am, however, officially asking her to move in. We have discussed that at least, so I‚Äôm going to make it official.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was proud of herself. It was Wanda‚Äôs turn to choke on something., ‚ÄúWhat? When?‚Äù She spluttered as Nat just smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you really surprised? They‚Äôre always over at each other‚Äôs places anyway, and with Alice moving to the compound this weekend, they can still carpool.‚Äù Nat commented.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes at Nat before answering Wanda. ‚ÄúIt would be in June, so, you know, all the gayness during Pride. I want to ask her on my birthday.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs on Friday. That‚Äôs THIS Friday!‚Äù If Wanda hadn‚Äôt been in a booth, she would have fallen off her chair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know when my birthday is.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNicky‚Äôs going to be so excited. He loves that cat,‚Äù Nat smiled, leaving the unspoken ‚Äúand Rio‚Äù in the air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never lived with a partner before,‚Äù Agatha realized out loud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had always shot that request down, no matter how many times Agatha brought it up. Agatha had lived with Wanda and Nat, and Lorna had lived with her a few times in between men before she stopped marrying them and finally bought her own place and just dated. She had shared places with other actresses while filming, but this would be a first for her. Agatha started laughing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am nearly fifty-two and have done things in the strangest order my whole life. I
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       divorced
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      my mother and struck out on my own at 16. I technically adopted a teenager at twenty-two,‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúExcuse you, a sibling,‚Äù Wanda interjected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe did raise you,‚Äù Nat pointed out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù Wanda retorted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was in the world‚Äôs most messed up relationship for ten years, had a kid on my own, my real mother was only thirteen years older than me and had a child that I took in later, I adopted the person hired to kill me, and now she‚Äôs marrying the other woman I raised, I fell in love with the best friend of another child I took in‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha stopped as she snorted. ‚ÄúOh my God, it‚Äôs this entire universe. I should chart it. I‚Äôm like the sun.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda just shook her head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like you‚Äôre drunk on your own absurdity. We‚Äôre taking you home.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha raised her head and looked around. ‚ÄúWait, where‚Äôs Sharon?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As if summoned, the woman appeared beside their table.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just dropping by for a second. I was told you were here and wanted to check-in. Is everything okay?‚Äù Sharon was eyeing Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda nodded. ‚ÄúWe were just about to leave and get back to Rio and Alice.‚Äù Wanda and Nat slipped from the booth and hugged the older woman, sensing that Agatha and Sharon needed to talk for a few minutes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúEverything okay with you and Rio?‚Äù Sharon asked as Agatha stood, and the two whispered together conspiratorially.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt will be,‚Äù she stopped next to the door and turned to face Sharon, looking down at the shorter woman. ‚ÄúThank you for watching over them and taking care of her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll always be that sixteen-year-old kid causing trouble, Aggie. Global award-winning star or not, and Lilia asked me to keep an eye out.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs smile softened. ‚ÄúHow are things going between you two?‚Äù she gave Sharon a knowing look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon gave a sly smile. ‚ÄúHow did you know?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúA hunch, and I know Lilia,‚Äù
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Well, I did.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs casual, has been for a few years. We spend time together when she‚Äôs here, or I‚Äôm in LA. We have a good time together, and that‚Äôs it. See other people, that kind of thing.‚Äù Sharon‚Äôs face said it was moving past casual for her, and Agatha knew she was going to be poking and prodding at Lilia soon.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôll retire soon and move up here,‚Äù Agatha tried to be hopeful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The older woman just scoffed. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll never leave that haunted house of hers.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAt least the ghosts are friendly.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon locked eyes with Agatha, her voice tinged with sadness, ‚ÄúThe ghosts of the living are never friendly, Agatha.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had fallen asleep while talking to Alice, during which time she had learned more about Alice‚Äôs ten years in the city before Rio‚Äôs arrival. When Agatha introduced Jen and Alice, they quickly became friends. Then, when Alice found she had no one to talk to about everyday life at SHIELD, she had Jen, who often had dealings with the school and had signed the very same NDAs. They grew closer, and Alice woke up one day and realized she was in love with Jen. By then, she valued her ever-growing relationship but didn‚Äôt want to ruin anything. Alice hadn‚Äôt dared to do anything until Rio came back into her daily life and gave her that push.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice recounted how she decided she needed to build a relationship with Lilia to learn more about Lorna and that she had built a closeness with Agatha but still kept her at a slight distance. Rio had fallen asleep as Alice‚Äôs little spoon while clutching the geriatric moose while Alice was telling her about different pranks the boys had played. Rio usually did not sleep like the dead. That was Agatha‚Äôs job. She hadn‚Äôt noticed when Alice left, tucking a blanket around her before she went.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and the redheaded wonders returned to see Alice watching crime documentaries.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIs Rio still asleep?‚Äù Agatha asked, already on her way up the stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, do not wake her up, Agatha Fucking Harkness!‚Äù Alice yelled as Agatha vanished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda and Nat joined Alice as the expert on the television was explaining how the murder was committed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat scoffed. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs giving the wrong directions.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBabe, they‚Äôre not directions,‚Äù Wanda looked at her in amusement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still wrong.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha quietly slipped into the bedroom and stood at the side of the bed, watching Rio as she slept, curled up with the ancient moose, before she joined Rio on the bed and pressed herself against Rio‚Äôs back. She carefully draped her arm over Rio‚Äôs torso and covered the younger woman‚Äôs hand with her own, placing a kiss on the back of Rio‚Äôs neck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha thought about her little family and how she had watched Wanda and Nat while they were out, as well as the look on Alice‚Äôs face when she texted Jen. The way she oversaw and, at times, facilitated those journeys over the years, the people she loved and cared for the most had all found love.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was no reason why this couldn‚Äôt finally work out for her, and she was fully committed to it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù she whispered into Rio‚Äôs ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLove, too,‚Äù Rio mumbled, rolling over and nuzzling into Agatha‚Äôs chest, moose in between them, like an anchor to reality.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your head, my love?‚Äù Agatha ran her hand up and down Rio‚Äôs back and kissed her forehead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBetter, hurts less.‚Äù Rio forced her eyes open as she brought herself out of her slumber to look at her girlfriend. Agatha‚Äôs beauty disarmed her momentarily. She was so in love with this woman. Then thoughts and questions from the past several days flooded her mind and out of her mouth as though she hadn‚Äôt just woken up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe two times we ran into each other at Norma‚Äôs, why were you really there? I remember running into you and then pretending like we hadn‚Äôt bumped into each other the night before when Norma introduced us or reintroduced us. What was that about?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha ran a hand through Rio‚Äôs hair, not showing sadness at a ruined moment but committed to telling the truth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, the first time was to bring Lorna back to LA but also to tell her I was pregnant. She was so excited. I just panicked the next morning, not wanting anyone to think I was creeping around the night before. The second time, she had run after finding out she was sick, and I came to bring her back and tell her we were fighting it together. It was another panic moment. You were also of age then, and I did not need an interrogation from Norma. She knew about the relationship with Lilia and kept telling me I was going to rob a cradle one day. She‚Äôs laughing from beyond the grave, I‚Äôm sure of it.‚Äù Agatha smiled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI remember every detail of both times. I couldn‚Äôt share either time with Alice. I knew she‚Äôd make fun of me forever. As it was, she teased me over how much I blushed the times we officially met. There are only a handful of things I‚Äôve kept from Alice, those being two of them.‚Äù Rio fought the urge not to bury her face in her hands. ‚ÄúDid I ever tell you that you were my gay awakening?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha snorted. ‚ÄúI have heard that millions of times, but to hear it from you is a completely different feeling,‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio could feel her cheeks reddening. ‚ÄúI was young, maybe seven or eight? It was a high school slasher flick you were in, and you had on this purple bikini, coming out of the water, and it was that moment when I felt something and thought, ‚ÄòI like girls.‚Äô As I got older, it never went away, and I never felt the same way about boys. So, I can honestly say I fell in love with the woman that made me realize I was gay.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled. Something about knowing she was the person who first made Rio realize she liked girls made her heart stutter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFull circle, huh?‚Äù While Agatha‚Äôs words were teasing, her eyes were not. ‚ÄúThat was a terrible movie. You were way too young to watch it, and I was in an awful headspace. I am glad you watched it, though, and that seeing me on a screen helped you realize your attraction to the fairer sex.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked down at the comforter in thought for a moment before looking back at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt just your looks, Agatha. It was the way your personality shone through. I went to the library after that and looked up every interview you had done, anything I could find on you‚Äînewspaper articles about your court case, any newsreel. Even though I was young, I had this thirst for knowledge and a slightly obsessive nature. I had been forced to grow up already, and I connected with something in you. I needed to know more, and I found all of that out. You immediately became my favorite actress. While other little girls in 1997 were obsessed with boy bands, I was obsessed with learning about how you had advanced queer rights, changed laws, and continued to be yourself and not shy away from it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMeeting Alice and being taken in by her and Gran was one thing. I was starstruck the first time I met Lorna, but Norma tried to make sure we weren‚Äôt there when Lorna was detoxing. Your presence nearly killed my baby gay self.‚Äù Rio laughed and then changed the subject quickly to cover up her awkwardness. ‚ÄúWho gave you this senior citizen?‚Äù Rio motioned with the moose she held, assuming there was a story.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let Rio get away with the topic switch and looked down at the moose, a hint of sadness in her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was sixteen, Evanora was in prison, and it was technically my first Christmas on my own, even though I wasn‚Äôt. Lorna and Lilia brought me up here and we spent Christmas up here. I saw a moose in the wild for the first time. It was huge and scared the life out of me. I was skiing and almost went into a snowbank. So they presented me with the moose here. They thought they were hilarious.‚Äù She smiled at the memory.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDoes he have a name?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was sixteen‚Ä¶‚Äù Was the only answer Agatha gave, her face flushing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. ‚ÄúYou named him horny, didn‚Äôt you? Those are antlers, Agatha.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was sixteen!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs laughter died out as she cupped Agatha‚Äôs chin and made Agatha look at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI want to hear about them and the past, Agatha. I want to hear more stories about Nicky as a kid and what playing Elphaba was like. Reliving the past can hurt, I know, but that‚Äôs how we keep those memories alive,‚Äù Rio placed her thumb in the middle of Agatha‚Äôs cleft chin. ‚ÄúI love you, Agatha, and if I have to tell you that every hour of every day for you to get it through your thick skull just how much I mean it, I will. The good, the bad, the ugly, I‚Äôm here for it all, Agatha Fucking Harkness.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs hand slid from Agatha‚Äôs chin to her chin and around to the back of her head as she moved to press herself against Agatha, who moved the Moose.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLorna,‚Äù Agatha replied. ‚ÄúI actually changed my middle name to Lorna.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She clarified as she pulled Rio closer and drew her in for a kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The five women had returned to their homes in the city on Wednesday to prepare for their return to their various places of employment on Thursday. Rio, however, was not allowed to return until Monday due to her recovery. Sharon and Lilia‚Äôs orders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen had put out a statement in People that had gone over well, and the celebrity-obsessed internet was making video edits of either one deceased supermodel or two women singing drunk karaoke. With everyone returning to their normal lives, Wanda had one issue that needed resolution.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda hadn‚Äôt technically asked Lilia if they could meet. Instead, she texted the older woman and declared when she would be at her house and that Lilia needed to be there. Wanda, being more polite than her counterparts, though, at least announced her arrival as she crossed the threshold into the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLilia, just what the hell were you thinking!‚Äù Wanda yelled as she stormed in, volume and anger surprising even herself. Her plan to walk in calmly and talk this out flying right out the window. This was Lilia, Wanda reminded herself. They needed her, and she was family. And family wrongs must be addressed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was more than just her best friend. She was her sister.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had been there through everything. Agatha had taken her in and taught her almost everything she knew. Agatha held her through nightmares through heartbreak and had been there when the boys were born. Agatha was one of the most important people in her life, and to know she had been hurt so deeply by Lilia, of all people, and under Wanda‚Äôs nose activated every protective instinct in Wanda she possessed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was furious.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia sat at the kitchen table, legs crossed at the knees, drinking her tea, a stack of papers set to the side. A cup of tea sat across from her next to a plate of homemade pizzicati.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was not surprised to get your text, Wanda. I just didn‚Äôt know
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       when
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      I would get it, ceai?‚Äù Lilia gestured toward the seat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda stood and glared at Lilia, awaiting an answer. Lilia exhaled sharply through her nose.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been asked that question a few times the past few days, and I honestly don‚Äôt think I was. Not clearly, anyway.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs fucking obvious!‚Äù Wanda spat, full accent on display.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda‚Äôs accent came out on three occasions. When she used it with Nat on purpose, when she was drunk, and when she was furious.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her accent had not come out with Agatha or Nat the other night. She had been upset with them, but not to this level.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had only seen Wanda like this once before, and she remembered that day with clarity.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       When Wanda was stalked, the stalker went further than any of them thought he would.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       He threatened the boys. Agatha had been out of town when the threat to the boys had been made, and Wanda immediately appeared at school. She walked a path across Lilia‚Äôs office, speaking three different languages, like a caged tiger.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       The body washed up on the beach a week later.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Right now, Wanda stood, eyes attempting to set Lilia on fire.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIn my country, you would be food for pigs. I hear it‚Äôs the same in most of the American South.‚Äù Wanda continued. Her arms were crossed, and she was tapping her foot. She looked every bit the disappointed mother but much more frightening, especially with the Romanian accent.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow could you do that to her? You left her when she needed you! You helped raise her! You had a relationship with her?! I‚Äôm still both shocked and disturbed by that. If the two of you had just communicated at all, none of this would have happened!‚Äù Wanda threw her hands in the air with a cry of exasperation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia opened her mouth to speak, but the words died before leaving her mouth when Wanda held up her hand to silence her, and the younger woman continued.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what everything boils down to, isn‚Äôt it? No one knows how to talk to each other?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI-‚Äù Lilia started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda‚Äôs glare just intensified as she continued talking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou can speak when I‚Äôm done,‚Äù Wanda said sharply. ‚ÄúLook at what you did to yourself, Lilia! Was it worth it? Was playing this game and losing Lorna worth it? I saw how it broke Lorna those last few years. Every time Nicky did something for the first time, she and Agatha both wished you were there to witness it, Lilia. The looks they gave each other and the sadness they communicated. I knew, maybe no one else did, but I understood that you were missing. I never knew what happened until this past weekend, and no one would tell me, but damnit Lilia. I can‚Äôt imagine how I would have felt if Agatha hadn‚Äôt been there for those moments. Or at least watch videos of them. I missed you being there with the twins‚Äô milestones, too, but I knew I could still bring them over here occasionally until they learned to talk and rat me out.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda still spoke from a place of anger but softened when she talked about the boys. It hardened again when she jumped to the next topic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI was so hopeful when you were at the hospital when Nicky was born! Lorna was sober, and I know you would have been happy for her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia spoke up then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLorna told me when she sent the two of you back up with Agatha. I was so proud of her. I texted her later, telling her as much. She never responded. I knew she was sick at the end. She came to my house a few months before it happened. She wanted to apologize for the things she did. I said something stupid, and instead of being us again for the last few months of her life, that was the last time I saw her. I‚Äôm sorry Agatha didn‚Äôt tell you what happened.‚Äù Lilia blinked the tears back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda‚Äôs face hardened. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve forgiven her because that‚Äôs what family does, Lilia. You and Lorna let your pride get in the way. For the two women who taught Agatha and me how to be a family, you two didn‚Äôt listen to yourselves.‚Äù She moved to drink her ceai. Her voice was hoarse from talking so much.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI also haven‚Äôt told you it‚Äôs your turn yet.‚Äù She replaced the cup on the table. ‚ÄúHow could you destroy her like that? I have watched her for eighteen years continue to give her body to near strangers night after night because she wouldn‚Äôt form a connection with anyone. Only sex. She would constantly tell Nat and me that sex was all she could do. I watched her scream along to angst-filled songs that ripped at her heart and cry over old pictures when she didn‚Äôt think anyone was watching. I watched her live with that pain, Lilia.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      How Wanda was still in control of herself, she wasn‚Äôt sure.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWanda, I,‚Äù Lilia tried again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNope. When Lorna died, she needed YOU, Lilia. Not me. YOU. I‚Äôm a big enough person that I can admit that. Hell, we all needed you, but Agatha especially. She still wears that locket to everything, and even when you can‚Äôt see it, she has it on her. Yes, she told me what it means. I asked her once when I was younger. She may have removed your hair from it, but she still has it.‚Äù Wanda had walked the length of the kitchen twice and was boring a hole into Lilia‚Äôs soul.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had known that Agatha had removed her lock of hair. Lorna had told her. Lilia did not, however, know she had kept it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda‚Äôs anger was beginning to wane somewhat, but only because she was so tired of all of this. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt just hurt Agatha. Your actions hurt all of us. She trusted you, and yes, she is beautiful and alluring, but damnit Lilia. You two couldn‚Äôt have kept it in your pants?‚Äù She spat, her face had lost the scarlet it had held while she was angry, and she had lost much of her steam. ‚ÄúYou may speak now.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia looked up at her with pride. The one they had always protected had become a protector.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou have grown into an incredibly strong woman, Wanda. I am so proud of you. You‚Äôre one of the few people who Agatha will let fight for her because she fully trusts you. I know you are outraged with me, and I would be too. I am, still. You watched Agatha and Lorna go through it, not understanding what happened, and now that you know that I caused it. The one person who was never supposed to cause any of them, or you, harm, you‚Äôre angry. You‚Äôre also sad.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think you can Calderu your way out of this, Lilia.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia scoffed. ‚ÄúOh, I know I can‚Äôt. You‚Äôre going to keep a very watchful eye on me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù Wanda‚Äôs accent was dissipating, but she was still weary of Lilia. She loved the woman, but Lilia was right. Wanda would be watching her. Wanda slid into the kitchen chair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI never meant to hurt anyone, and as they say, hindsight is 20/20. If I could undo it all, I would. However, I did, and I have to own up to that. I did hurt everyone I love and I can never fix things with Lorna, which is why I want to at least try and repair things now. I am so sorry for what I did to all of you. I needed all of you in my life, and I‚Äôm glad I had you in the small capacity I did. I‚Äôm sorry she kept it from you, but that‚Äôs my fault. Lorna and I taught her to keep things close to the vest, and she did.‚Äù Lilia left out the hair tidbit and watched as Wanda thought everything over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAnd Rio?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia smiled warmly. ‚ÄúI did not plan on them falling in love. That‚Äôs a little too manipulative, even for me. For example, when I scheduled Morgan and Nicky to be in the same classes since pre-k, I was trying to mend the relationship between Tony and Agatha. Certainly not matchmake children. They‚Äôre children.‚Äù Lilia hated that someone had even suggested it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda took a bite of one of the jam-filled cookies before her. ‚ÄúWhat is the story between Tony and Agatha? She‚Äôs never told me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A memory flashed across Lilia‚Äôs face as she shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAsk again. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll tell you now. Back to the topic at hand, I‚Äôm glad you and Agatha can move past things and that you and Rio get along so well. You also didn‚Äôt find all of my hiding places in the cabin.‚Äù She smirked, referencing the mics, ‚ÄúHopefully, you and Nat can set a better example of healthy relationship dynamics. Wanda, it‚Äôs my fault she never told you about us. I insisted that we not tell anyone. I‚Äôm the one who told Lorna, and even then, Lorna acted like she figured it out. When in reality, I told Lorna because while I told myself she‚Äôd be happy for us, I knew she‚Äôd be upset, and God was she. I destroyed our relationship over it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      What I learned, Wanda, is that if the person you have been closest to for the majority of your life tells you that something is a terrible idea, you should listen. Chances are, they know you better than you know yourself. Lorna was right, and she kept telling me I was ripping Agatha and myself apart. Unfortunately, we‚Äôre all stubborn and hard-headed here.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm truly happy for Agatha and Rio if that‚Äôs what you're truly worried about. I have no romantic feelings for Agatha anymore. Like I told Rio, and she, I‚Äôm sure, told you, I love Agatha very much, but it‚Äôs the way I always loved her. Not the infatuated love I had for her once. I care for her, for all of you. I love all of you. Being in Agatha‚Äôs life in a larger capacity doesn‚Äôt just depend on Rio, and I know that‚Äù Lilia eyed Wanda, measuring just where she was now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda looked at the now empty plate. Damn Lilia and her culinary skills. ‚ÄúLilia, I love you, and we need you in our lives and our family,‚Äù Wanda‚Äôs eyes turned dark, ‚ÄúBut if you cause any more harm to my sister or anyone in this family, it won‚Äôt be Nat that you‚Äôll have to worry about.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had never been afraid of Wanda. The woman was kind and gentle. She once squashed a spider and cried.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      At this very moment, the sweet redhead terrified her.
     </span>
</p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had decided long ago to only have large celebrations for her birthday every five years. She had told Rio no gifts, though Agatha had a feeling she wouldn‚Äôt listen. No one ever did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had arrived home late from filming that Friday evening and had told her family that if they insisted on celebrating, then cake only. Maybe dinner. Rio was still restricted from too much activity until Sunday, which, while disappointing, just meant they‚Äôd have a bit of a busy week.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was slightly shocked that only Rio‚Äôs car sat in front of her house, though she knew better.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She walked into her house, the distinct smell of Lilia Calderu‚Äôs cooking in the air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia was in her house, on her birthday.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Most likely making Pasta Alla Norma.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It‚Äôs what she made Agatha every year for her birthday. Starting when she turned fifteen, Evanora had always spent Agatha‚Äôs birthday at church. Praying it would be Agatha‚Äôs last. Lorna and Lilia snuck Agatha out of her house and threw her a birthday party.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her very first one.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha walked into the kitchen to see her family, original members, and new additions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI said no celebrations unless it was cake.‚Äù Agatha tried to act annoyed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou said dinner was a maybe, so we took that as a yes,‚Äù Rio kissed her on the cheek. ‚ÄúHappy birthday.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      In all actuality, Agatha loved it. She had missed celebrating with Lilia. It just felt right. There was still work to be done, but things were improving. The kids didn‚Äôt even ask about her presence. They were smart. They could figure it out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Herb had fit right in, and the boys seemed to like him. Vision was taking things slowly with him, and Jen had handled their date expertly in the People article.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       ‚ÄúVision has always remained faithful to Wanda, though now that they are separated, he is free to date whoever he likes and has his family‚Äôs full support.‚Äù
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The three additional teens were a stable fixture. No one knew where Cassie and Tommy would end up, but they made great friends either way. Wanda had a betting pool going.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The house was filled with noise, celebration, and love. There was cake and Lilia‚Äôs cannoli, another birthday staple. Rio somehow managed to get icing on her nose, and Agatha kissed it off. Morgan told them to get a room. Nicky shouted that those were his mothers she was talking about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After dinner, entirely too much sugar and the presents which slightly annoyed Agatha, the teens made off to the clubhouse, and the men departed. The kitchen had been cleaned when Agatha wasn‚Äôt paying attention and suspected that was Wanda and Lilia‚Äôs doing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia took Agatha‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúWalk me to the door,‚Äù she instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your car?‚Äù Agatha asked the question that hadn‚Äôt been answered yet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe parked at Wanda‚Äôs, and the kids started bringing our cars over when they left a few minutes ago,‚Äù She winked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dark outside. The twins are still fourteen!‚Äù Yes, the four freshmen were being taught by Vision, as he was the village driving instructor, and Cassie and Eddie had turned fifteen and had learner's permits, but that didn‚Äôt make it safe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, they don‚Äôt have to leave the compound. It‚Äôs not far, they‚Äôll be fine. How old were you when you learned to drive?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDifferent times,‚Äù Agatha conceded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They stood on the front porch when Cassie and Tommy drove up in Lilia‚Äôs black BMW. ‚ÄúI remember a time when you tried to pretend you only made a principal‚Äôs salary,‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI invested very well in the nineties and sold when Apple hit its peak.‚Äù Lilia lied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSure you did.‚Äù Agatha turned and hugged the shorter woman. ‚ÄúThank you. For everything. We‚Äôre not‚Ä¶‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBut, one day.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOne day.‚Äù Lilia gave her a tight squeeze, waved to the kids, and left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky walked up to her and looked at her closely. He suspected that he had connected the right dots, and he did not like the picture they made. ‚ÄúScandalous, Mom. I need brain bleach.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, go have the party I‚Äôm pretending I don‚Äôt know about. No driving, take everyone‚Äôs keys, and for the love of God, don‚Äôt let anyone post on social media. Turn off all the routers, confiscate and lock up cell phones.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAlready the plan, love you.‚Äù he kissed her on the cheek and turned to where Morgan was waiting for him. The others had already left.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the rule?‚Äù she called after them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMisdemeanors, not felonies!‚Äù They called back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha walked back into the house as Alice and Jen were leaving.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHappy birthday, you old hag,‚Äù Jen said as she hugged her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget, you promised to help tomorrow.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know I did. You overgrown prune,‚Äù Agatha released her and hugged Alice, ‚ÄúThank you both. I love you, mainly you, Alice. We‚Äôll see you tomorrow.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She walked into the living room, where Rio and Nat looked at Agatha as if she were in trouble, and Wanda looked like a disappointed mom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDid you tell our boys that they could have a party?‚Äù Wanda asked, her voice strained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked shocked. ‚ÄúWhy, absolutely not!‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThen why did Kamala Khan‚Äôs mom just email me a signed NDA and consent form?‚Äù Wanda held up her phone. Agatha did not have an answer to that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat? I don‚Äôt know anything about that.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt appears that because the children are under eighteen and therefore cannot sign legal documents themselves, the people attending the party were given NDAs and consent forms to have signed by their parents. So that there is legal documentation that they were allowed to be there no matter what occurred and that they would not talk about it or post about it on social media.‚Äù Wanda explained, still trying to process.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAt least they‚Äôre smart,‚Äù Agatha offered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha!‚Äù Wanda reprimanded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, come on, Wanda, let them be kids. It seems like they only invited their close friends, friends with parents we know. They‚Äôre all smart kids.‚Äù Agatha reasoned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already tapped into the mics and cameras in the house,‚Äù Nat was looking at her phone. ‚ÄúSo far, so good.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda dropped her shoulders in defeat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still worried.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat stood, taking Wanda‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs go home and de-stress,‚Äù She grinned, whispering into Wanda‚Äôs ear and leading her towards the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGoodnight, you two. Love you both. Happy birthday, old lady.‚Äù Nat waved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Rio both smiled as Agatha held out her hand to Rio and led her up the stairs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy so many cameras in all the houses?‚Äù Rio wondered out loud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLiability, protection, several reasons other than basic security and just keeping an eye on things. People love to make things up, especially when they think money or fifteen minutes of fame may be involved. So, we get ahead of it and make sure they can‚Äôt.‚Äù Agatha shrugged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so used to being in front of cameras and having my whole life scrutinized that I forget they‚Äôre there. It‚Äôs an encrypted closed-circuit system, so only certain people have access. With the clubhouse, it‚Äôs like baby monitors for teenagers.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had changed into sleep shorts and a tank top and slipped under the covers into bed. Rio joined her, clad in a Stevie Nicks shirt and Snoopy boyshorts. She looked at Agatha, startled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre there cameras in this house?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt invite people we don‚Äôt trust into our private residences, and if it‚Äôs questionable, we have them sign an NDA.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wanted at least one place where she wasn‚Äôt in front of a camera, and home was it. The Clubhouse hadn‚Äôt been outfitted with cameras until the boys started hanging out there in middle school.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thought back to the very first night she had spent with Agatha. She had never signed anything. ‚ÄúAgatha, you never made me sign an NDA,‚Äù Rio watched her expression carefully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha drew Rio into her lap and regarded her lovingly. ‚ÄúI must have had a good feeling about you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned in and pressed a kiss to Rio‚Äôs lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio kissed her back, parting her lips as the kiss intensified. Agatha‚Äôs tongue licked the roof of Rio‚Äôs mouth, and the backs of her teeth, and rolled against her tongue. Rio moaned at the sensations and readjusted to where she straddled Agatha‚Äôs thighs, slightly breaking their kiss so they could breathe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took the opportunity to pull back, her hand firmly planted on the small of Rio‚Äôs back, holding her steady.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNot cleared until Sunday.‚Äù She reminded them both, her voice husky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha, I haven‚Äôt had to take anything in twenty-four hours. I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù Rio whined, fingertips gliding across the expanse of Agatha‚Äôs stomach under her tank top. ‚ÄúBesides, there are ways we could do this that aren‚Äôt too strenuous‚Ä¶‚Äù Rio let her unspoken plea linger in the air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shuddered at the light touch, running her free hand through Rio‚Äôs hair and lightly gripping the back of her neck. If they were doing this, it would be on Agatha‚Äôs terms. She brought their lips together again in a slow kiss, savoring the feeling of Rio‚Äôs lips against hers. She moved her hands to the hem of Rio‚Äôs shirt, removing it and tossing it into the darkened room. Agatha looked up at Rio, running her fingers from Rio‚Äôs temple to her jaw.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou will tell me if it‚Äôs too much or if you start to get sore, a headache, anything, understand?‚Äù Agatha leaned forward, planting open-mouthed kisses across Rio‚Äôs chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio moaned and rolled her hips against Agatha‚Äôs thighs. ‚ÄúYes, baby,‚Äù she gasped when Agatha bit down on a hardened nipple.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAlready so needy, I can feel you against my thigh.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha flicked her tongue across Rio‚Äôs nipple. In response, Rio wrapped her hands in Agatha‚Äôs hair, holding her closer, focusing on the sensations from Agatha‚Äôs mouth and hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI missed you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nipped right above Rio‚Äôs right breast, causing her to gasp. Agatha felt the familiar sensation of want and need growing low in her belly. Agatha knew she would tease Rio for a little longer before she gave them what they both so desperately needed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was trying to find any possible friction she could and not getting what she needed. Rio removed Agatha‚Äôs top and pinched and rolled Agatha‚Äôs nipples, eliciting sounds of her own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha.‚Äù Rio grabbed a fistful of hair and pulled her head back to make eye contact. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she begged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha cupped the back of Rio‚Äôs head and kissed her slowly and passionately. Agatha tugged at the boyshorts. Rio broke the kiss and quickly shifted to remove them and took a moment to free Agatha of the rest of her clothing. Rio returned to her rightful place atop Agatha and resumed the kiss, grinding against her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha cupped Rio‚Äôs right buttcheek and ran her other hand up her inner thigh and along the crease of where it met her torso.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs breath caught, and she whimpered. ‚ÄúAgatha,‚Äù she pleaded again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat is it, baby?‚Äù Agatha asked innocently, her own need hidden by her clenched thighs, though she felt it throughout her entire body.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned in next to her ear. ‚ÄúMake love to me,‚Äù she purred before kissing Agatha under her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha moaned and slid a finger through Rio‚Äôs folds. Rio made a keening sound and pushed her back against the headboard, kissing her as though her lips were made of nectar.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha circled Rio‚Äôs clit and applied just enough pressure that Rio bucked and moaned into her mouth, continuing the cycle until Rio was panting into her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio kept clenching around nothing and dropped her mouth to Agatha‚Äôs shoulder, biting hard enough to leave a mark. ‚ÄúI need you, now.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúImpatient,‚Äù Agatha smirked, not changing positions, causing Rio to pout.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha brought her other hand up to cup the back of Rio‚Äôs head and twisted her hand, inserting two fingers into Rio and feeling the muscles constrict immediately.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat was fast,‚Äù she said before dropping a line of kisses down Rio‚Äôs neck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs reply was lost in a chain of satisfied sounds as she rocked her hips to meet Agatha‚Äôs rhythm as her fingers pumped into Rio. Agatha increased her speed and moved to kiss Rio, who slowed her bucking so that she could move to where she only straddled one of Agatha‚Äôs thighs. Before Agatha could ask why, Rio‚Äôs thumb was on her clit, rubbing slightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs hips rolled at the touch. ‚ÄúNot too strenuous,‚Äù Agatha warned against Rio‚Äôs mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNever.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio flipped her wrist around and slid two fingers into Agatha‚Äôs entrance. They brought their bodies together, legs entangled, and matched the other‚Äôs pace.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was sweet, it was slow, it was gentle. Third fingers were added, pressures were increased, and climaxes were reached. They held each other that way, chins resting on each other‚Äôs shoulders before finally detangling from each other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had her head on Agatha‚Äôs shoulder as they lay in bed, tracing shapes on the other‚Äôs skin and enjoying their post-coital bliss. Rio propped her head to look at the beautiful woman who loved her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it feel to be fifty-two? Any different?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned to look at the last woman she would ever love, the woman that would be her future. ‚ÄúYes, actually. I was so scared when I turned fifty-one. It‚Äôs how old Lorna was when she lost the fight. She left me a letter, of course. You‚Äôll have to read them one day.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI do want to, but I think I‚Äôm still processing the ones I‚Äôve read from Alice, so give me some time.‚Äù Rio interrupted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù Agatha resumed her musings. ‚ÄúLike always, she knew just what to say. Told me to fix things with Lilia if I hadn‚Äôt yet, hoped I had found love, not to freak out over turning fifty-one, and that I had nothing to worry about. After her diagnosis, I made sure to take control of my health. Every screening and annual appointment, I do them all, and she knew it. She reminded me that every day is a step closer to death, whether I like it or not, and I have to choose what to do with that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe knew that I love my family very much, but she also told me to remember to prioritize my happiness, too. Not just theirs. It‚Äôs like she knew I would still be single. All-knowing, even in death.‚Äù Agatha ran her finger in random lines and squiggles on Rio‚Äôs upper arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you happy?‚Äù Rio focused on a freckle on Agatha‚Äôs chest, afraid of the answer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha placed the tip of her finger under Rio‚Äôs chin and tipped it up so their eyes met.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, my love. I am happier than I have been in a very long time. You play a large part in that.‚Äù Upon seeing the grin appear on Rio‚Äôs lips, Agatha decided now was the time to ask her question. ‚ÄúI have two questions for you. First, are you happy?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded. ‚ÄúVery.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe next question is a bit bigger. I know we‚Äôve talked about it, but didn‚Äôt make it official. Don‚Äôt look so panicked, will you move in with me? In June? After school is out?‚Äù Agatha was trying to sound confident, but her voice was shaking and this time, she was the one rubbing her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned in and kissed her, swiping her tongue over Agatha‚Äôs bottom lip, not quite deepening the kiss, but a promise of things to come. She pulled back, her eyes a promise of the future.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, Agatha. I would love to move in with you, and Nicky has basically catnapped Raven, so she‚Äôs good with it, too.‚Äù Rio laughed as she kissed Agatha again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed contentedly. ‚ÄúGood, I can‚Äôt wait.‚Äù She pulled her close and wrapped her arms around her. In a few more months, this would no longer just be her and Nicky‚Äôs home.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It would be Rio‚Äôs, too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was pretty sure anywhere Raven was, was her kingdom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of the weekend went by quickly. They gathered at Alice and Jen‚Äôs house Saturday morning, and their six teens appeared, along with Vision, Herb, and Lilia. Furniture was moved, boxes unpacked, pictures and art hung. Alice and Jen‚Äôs house was officially theirs, and they were officially moved onto the compound. Everyone had turned to Rio, who informed them she‚Äôd be moving in in June.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tuesday was April Fool‚Äôs Day. Traditionally, Nicky‚Äôs favorite day, although he knew he couldn‚Äôt do anything too risky. This year, he asked Lilia‚Äôs permission for this particular prank, and after a sigh of defeat, she agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So on April first, all of the fountains at SHIELD turned into bubble fountains dyed in different colors of the rainbow flag, courtesy of Nicky and crew. Rio took pictures and sent them to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As for Rio, Alice had informed her that the fencing club was planning on wearing shirts to try and get under Rio‚Äôs skin. Another jab at who they saw as Agatha‚Äôs latest fling. Their shirts, according to Alice, were black with purple lettering that held the various ‚Äúclass years‚Äù to which each woman belonged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This time, there was no anger or emotional outbreak from Rio. Instead, she had Wanda help her make one of her own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her shirt was a light green with purple letters that read:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      SHIELD Fencing Club
     </span>
</p>
<p>

<span>
      On the back, Vidal was written across the top.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She could not wait to see the looks on those petty bitches‚Äôs faces later.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took a picture and sent it to Agatha. She was finally taking ownership of her relationship with Agatha, and they were working on their communication and making it what they needed it to be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was something she had never had before and something she truly looked forward to doing.

      Part of Rio had been worried that Alice was playing her own April Fool‚Äôs Day prank. However, walking into the teacher‚Äôs lounge and seeing the looks on a few faces of women in their black Fencing Club shirts reassured Rio that her ride and/or die had indeed been telling her the truth. Alice had gone with her and made sure to immortalize the looks of absolute horror and disgust and sent them to the rest of the coven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was a good day with zero harmful pranks, and the students just thought their teachers were referencing an after-school Happy Hour. These kids were not phased by many things and at this crucial time of the year, they had bigger things to worry about than what manner of questionable things their teachers were doing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The shirt became one of Agatha‚Äôs favorites, judging by the way she greeted Rio at the door and ravaged her on the couch, unable to make it to the bedroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The school year always moved faster towards the end of the year with testing, ceremonies, performances, and all of the major projects due. With Agatha and Wanda so busy during the week, Rio felt like minutes flew by, but days slowed down. Football was in spring training, track was in full swing, and she found herself looking forward to the weekends more than usual or doing test prep with upperclassmen for college entrance exams. There were also AP tests and Dual Credit tests for those trying to get college credits.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had Coachella, the Beach Music Festival, the Prom, and the SHIELD end-of-the-year showcase to look forward to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While not all students at SHIELD were into fine arts, several still wanted to show off their talents and they prepared all year for this week. The last week of school was filled with showcase scrimmages, one-act plays, art displays, and recitals, with everyone showing off their skills. Their lives were packed for most of April and May, leading up to Memorial Day weekend at the beach house to kick off the summer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The powers that be for SHIELD had deemed the next two Fridays and Mondays ‚Äòvirtual instruction‚Äô days since a large portion of students would be either attending one of the two weekends of Coachella or going with their parents to the area but not to the festival itself, much like they did for days after award ceremonies. Most students had already completed the work as teachers had released it early, and Rio had already graded everything that had been turned in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio closed the door to her classroom at the end of the day Thursday and turned to leave, running into Lilia instead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhere did you even come from?‚Äù Rio put a hand to her chest in surprise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDepends on who you ask, my office, New York,‚Äù she leaned her head to the side, ‚Äúhell.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The side of Rio‚Äôs mouth ticked up, and she had a feeling of who had said the last one.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLorna or Agatha?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNeither.‚Äù Something dark flickered across Lilia‚Äôs face before her normal cheerful expression returned. ‚ÄúI wanted to ask if you planned on returning next year and if you would want to accept the head basketball coaching position officially. While Peggy is staying, she is resigning from coaching. It comes with a small pay bump.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt I stay?‚Äù Rio asked, taken aback by the question.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTo travel with Agatha and be able to spend more time with her,‚Äù Lilia answered as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio mulled it over. It was something Agatha had been worried about, the traveling and distance taking a toll. They had handled it well so far, and this summer would be a much further and longer time apart. However, they were working on their communication skills and building a very strong and solid relationship. Even when apart, there were ways to remain connected in all aspects, and they trusted each other. Why would she give up her career? Agatha would support her if Rio wanted to, but Rio wasn‚Äôt that person.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm staying, and I‚Äôd love to take the position officially.‚Äù Rio finally said firmly. ‚ÄúWalk with me.‚Äù She instructed Lilia. The rest of the coven and the confidence they exuded was wearing off on her, and Lilia followed. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs going to be difficult, Lilia, but what relationship isn‚Äôt? I‚Äôm done bolting every time things get hard. I can visit if and when I can when she‚Äôs gone for months at a time. I love her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They exited the building and walked toward Rio‚Äôs car. She and Alice hadn‚Äôt carpooled, as Rio had been at her apartment and not at the compound. She put her backpack in the passenger seat and turned to look questioningly at Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy? What concerns do you have? I‚Äôm still trying to separate the evil ex and the caring aunt, and while part of me screams ‚Äòchoke a bitch,‚Äô I see you here, and you genuinely care for her. You want her to be happy, and I truly believe you want us to work. I see how she looks at you now, and she adores you. It‚Äôs so confusing.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia looked down and crossed her arms, letting the unprofessional admission slide. It was after hours.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know it is, and your feelings are completely valid. I always thought she needed someone who could travel with her. However, with technology the way it is, she just needs that connection. I have no hard feelings or ill will, no jealousy. Agatha and I¬† agree that we‚Äôre better off with our original dynamic, and somewhere, things went off course for too long. We learned from our mistakes, and we grew from them. It made us who we are today, for better or worse. I do want what‚Äôs best for everyone, Rio.‚Äù Lilia looked up, locking eyes with Rio. ‚ÄúThat includes you, and you can come to me anytime, about anything, when you feel comfortable.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep that in mind, Lilia. Thank you. I mean that. I know you‚Äôve been protecting me all year, for Agatha‚Äôs sake, and I appreciate it.‚Äù Rio did mean it, but she was no longer shying away from certain petty women. ‚ÄúI think I have control now, though. I‚Äôll let you know If I need backup.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia gave her a genuine smile, ‚ÄúOh, I know you will. You did well last week. It wasn‚Äôt all for Agatha, though.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio‚Äôs eyebrows formed a question mark. Lilia shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDid I ever tell you that Lorna and I grew up together in New York? The City, specifically? Our parents were friends, and I, like you, spent a lot of time in Norma Wu‚Äôs house. My parents were Italian. Very stereotypical Bronx Italian, the way movies depict us. Very connected, I kept some of those connections. Norma was more concerned about you than you‚Äôll ever know. Called me a few times about you and your situation with your parents.‚Äù Lilia glanced at her smartwatch. ‚ÄúWell, look at the time. I need to get to Palm Springs to pick up Sharon. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll see you at the festival.‚Äù She gave Rio a quick hug and hurried off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched her go. What the hell had she meant about Norma?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They had made it to the extremely exclusive club resort near the Coachella grounds late that night. Agatha tried not to fly short distances, especially if they were in-state, so the whole crew drove southeast. They had an entire wing for their clan and security detail. Rio lay in their bed in her Bulbasaur boxers and a green tank top, thinking about Lilia‚Äôs childhood.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned her head as she caught sight of Agatha walking in from the bathroom in one of Rio‚Äôs Phoenix Mercury shirts and purple hipsters that she knew had Naughty written across the back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHi, gorgeous.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio reached toward Agatha and motioned for her to join her in the bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pulled back the covers and joined Rio, lying on her side to face her, kissing her slowly, and drinking her in. Agatha slipped one hand between Rio‚Äôs pillow and her cheek, tracing her jawline with her thumb. The other arm she draped over Rio and pulled her closer to Agatha, sliding her knee in between Rio‚Äôs. Rio‚Äôs arms mirrored hers, and they lay there, entangled and kissing, until one of them decided they needed more air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tilted her head back slightly and sighed contently, her eyes half closed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhy do long drives make us so tired?‚Äù She asked rhetorically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The scientist in Rio could not resist. ‚ÄúOur bodies are technically at rest. However, they are being hurtled at unnatural speeds, which can raise our adrenaline levels, and then they drop quickly. There‚Äôs also poor air quality and overstimulation from constant input, which leads to mental exhaustion and possible dehydration since you‚Äôre generally not drinking as much. That depends on how long the drive is, though. Also, the vibrations from the car can just give you that rocking-a-baby-to-sleep reaction, and then sitting too long has its effects on the body.‚Äù Rio was deep in teacher mode, and it was very cute.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThank you, Ms. Vidal, that was very informative. It was a rhetorical question, but you‚Äôre so cute when you get all educational.‚Äù Agatha leaned forward and kissed her again quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled into it. She had told Agatha about some of the discussion she had had with Lilia that afternoon and had questions, that, like always, gnawed at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAgatha,‚Äù she started. ‚ÄúIs Lilia in the mafia?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha clicked her tongue. Well, this wasn‚Äôt going to go in the direction she somewhat hoped it would go, though she was absolutely exhausted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe do not break the spaghetti, and we do not talk about the mafia.‚Äù Was the answer Agatha gave Rio. However, Agatha was confused by the random question. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chewed on the inside of her lip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLilia told me today that she grew up in the type of New York Italian family that movies portrayed. And all I can see now is the Godfather in my head. That Lilia‚Äôs family was connected and she kept some of those connections. Then, she said that Norma talked to her a few times about my home situation with my biological mother and her husband. I did a little bit of research. It‚Äôs not Little Italy in Manhattan, like where we visited. She‚Äôs from the original and old-school families from up on Arthur Avenue ‚Äù Rio locked eyes with Agatha again before she could reply. ‚ÄúRemember, no more lies, half-truths, or omissions.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Shit.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She would just spin it differently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe came from that type of family, yes, but Lilia distanced herself, with permission, that is. She still has the connections if she needs them, and yes, Norma called her a few times before our blow-up. I don‚Äôt know about after.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded‚Äîsome secrets Rio would have to accept.

      Coachella weekend was an absolute blast for everyone and packed with new memories. Wanda and Nat were excited to be completely open at a concert and acted like teenagers. They recreated their Lilith Fair days to the Missy Elliot set, and even though they were in the VIP section, pictures were taken and put on the internet, some of them by their own family and friends.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen Kale-Wu, as she and Alice had officially decided to hyphenate their names, was working overtime. There was not an image clause in either star‚Äôs contract, but she knew the studios would frown on this. Specifically Wanda. It didn‚Äôt matter what year it was or that the president of the United States was a black married lesbian woman with two kids. Some people were still awful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice Wu-Kale took her wife‚Äôs phone away from her for the rest of the weekend and probably saved her life by preventing her from having a heart attack.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha loved seeing her other friends and those who were performing, but as always, she enjoyed taking in the scene around her and living in the moment. She and Tony were both equipped with spray bottles for when Nicky and Morgan made out a little
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       too
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      long, though they were quickly confiscated by Pepper and Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky complained that Billy and Eddie didn‚Äôt get sprayed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt get pregnant,‚Äù Tony and Agatha deadpanned at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan rolled her eyes and said they were definitely not doing that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky muttered something about how, if they were, they would be smart about it and how he had gotten the talk way earlier than most.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen took the squirt bottle from Rio and shot Wanda in the face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey! I can‚Äôt get pregnant!‚Äù Wanda wiped the water off her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, but you‚Äôre going to be the death of me if you don‚Äôt calm down,‚Äù Jen warned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha loved her growing group of found family.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her eyes scanned the area to see Lilia with Sharon. They were only a few years apart in age, and she made a mental note to find out the official story there. Sharon was singing along, and Lilia had a look on her face that Agatha had never seen before. It wasn‚Äôt the one Lilia wore when she told Agatha she loved her or even at the end when they had agreed to get married.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No, Lilia looked at Sharon like she was the only person that existed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha flinched, expecting that age-old hurt to reappear, to feel something in her carefully sewn-together heart rip back open, but it didn‚Äôt. If anything, it strengthened the seam.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was happy for Lilia, and she suddenly understood why Lilia had meddled. To see Agatha look like that. Happy and in love, to truly bring out the best version of herself. Not that she needed to be in love, but Agatha knew she hadn‚Äôt been completely happy, and Lilia hadn‚Äôt been either, without her family. Agatha had gone soft, and she didn‚Äôt completely hate it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPocket-lint for your thoughts.‚Äù Wanda had come up beside her and was speaking right into her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe expression is ‚Äòpenny‚Äô. You know that.‚Äù Agatha looked at her out of the side of her eye.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúA penny is too pricy for your gutter thoughts, Harkness.‚Äù Wanda quipped with a grin, bumping their shoulders together. Agatha bumped her back and nodded in Lilia and Sharon‚Äôs direction. They were now leaning into each other for a slower song.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLook at them, look at Lilia.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda watched the two women for a moment, her face lighting up. ‚ÄúAww, so cute.‚Äù She pulled out her phone and opened an app, typing something.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed. ‚ÄúYou have an app, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI have an app.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat do you do with all your romantic betting pool winnings?‚Äù Agatha knew Wanda did these things just for fun. They all did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDonate it usually.‚Äù Wanda shrugged. ‚ÄúAlthough, I think we should look into starting our own foundation, in Lorna‚Äôs name.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her, searching for what to say.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, you know one of us would have thought of it eventually,‚Äù Wanda added upon seeing Agatha‚Äôs shock.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm more shocked that you want to use illegally gotten gains for charity.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda‚Äôs smile widened. ‚ÄúYou know she‚Äôd be proud.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed. ‚ÄúYou know, you‚Äôre not wrong.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Somewhere, Lorna was very proud of the girls she raised.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of the music festival weekend continued in much the same way. Agatha sang several songs to Rio, including ‚ÄúBeautiful Things,‚Äù Tony made faces, and Pepper smacked him on the shoulder, asking why he didn‚Äôt do sweet things like that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sunday night, after Coachella came to an end, Agatha, Rio, Wanda, Nat, Tony, and Pepper sat around a fire pit outside of the resort. The resort was hosting only celebrities and their entourages that weekend, and Agatha had been able to see several of her friends throughout the three days.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio decided it was the best time to ask exactly what their beef was with each other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the deal between you two?‚Äù Rio asked, looking between Tony and Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs difficult.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs difficult.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They answered at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The other women just looked at each other. No one truly knew what started it. Agatha had been a child star, and Tony had grown up in the world of film, following his father around, learning all there was to know. At first, Howard tried to put Tony in front of the camera, but that wasn‚Äôt Tony‚Äôs calling. He did better at directing. Pepper had been an assistant, and that‚Äôs how they met. Agatha had done several Howard Stark films, and she and Tony had strong personalities that matched each other. That had been the beginning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs bossy,‚Äù Agatha offered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs very hard-headed and stubborn,‚Äù he shot back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a nepo baby, and throws tantrums,‚Äù she countered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre both children,‚Äù Pepper interjected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey used to just bicker and fight like that, but then something else happened when Howard turned everything over to Tony.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs eyes went dark. ‚ÄúHe knows what he did.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony‚Äôs eyes went wide. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt! You got incredibly pissed at me and went from your particular brand of slightly toxic bantering to a complete bitch to work with Agatha. We‚Äôve gotten to where we can playfully banter, and our kids can date, but I still don‚Äôt know what I did wrong.‚Äù Tony looked at Pepper, hoping she knew, but the look on her face said she didn‚Äôt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLet me refresh your mind. You were about to take over all of Howard‚Äôs projects and he was trying to make it easy for you. Wanda was in a few of those projects.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha saw Wanda tense, and Nat took her hand. They knew what was coming.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhen all of a sudden pictures of her and Nat making out at a concert were everywhere, and they were outed, studios started getting backlash, and no one liked their straight golden goose having a preference toward girls, which I still do not understand since I haven‚Äôt had a huge problem. Word in the back alleys was that it was your doing. You were the one to take and leak the pictures so that you didn‚Äôt have a problem taking the keys to Daddy‚Äôs kingdom.‚Äù Her voice was caustic as the accusation left her lips. Rio stepped back, shocked that her innocent question had opened up such a volatile confession.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou what?‚Äù Wanda yelled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThey will never find your body. TWENTY YEARS!‚Äù Nat said darkly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting a divorce. How could you!‚Äù Pepper spat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre keeping Morgan in the divorce.‚Äù Rio put her hand to her chest, appalled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony looked at all five women.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI would deserve all of that if I had done it. But I didn‚Äôt. Dad wanted me to, but I refused. Dad wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äòallow me‚Äô to marry Pepper because she wasn‚Äôt famous, and it caused us a lot of lost time and pain. Do you think I was going to do that to Wanda? Someone I considered a friend? No. Was it my dad? Yes. I had nothing to do with it. That‚Äôs when I tried to set out on my own, but his heart got him a few weeks later.‚Äù Everyone lowered their hackles, considering Tony‚Äôs confession. ‚ÄúThe damage had unfortunately been done by then, and I couldn‚Äôt undo it. I apologize for that, but it wasn't me. Not even my photos.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was still for a moment before turning to Tony. ‚ÄúThank you for being honest and not being that person.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù Tony raised a glass of water in salute.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre still annoying,‚Äù Agatha attempted to double down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo are you.‚Äù Tony agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt kill you. Your kid does make mine happy.‚Äù Agatha admitted reluctantly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYour kid isn‚Äôt so bad. Thanks for not murdering me. You would have gotten away with it and taken my wife.‚Äù Tony mused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe would have.‚Äù Pepper winked at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nat was laughing. ‚ÄúGrowing up in this industry absolutely fucked you guys up. And coming from me, that says a lot.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt did.‚Äù Tony, Agatha, and Wanda said simultaneously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIn all seriousness though, no. I wanted things to work out for you two, and I‚Äôm glad it finally has. Vision‚Äôs a great guy, but come on, if I really wanted to out Wanda, I would have taken pictures at one of the many house parties we were at. Besides, you forget. I am a SHIELD alumnus, too, and Lilia would have murdered me. I knew how close she was to Lorna and you two. I‚Äôm not that stupid.‚Äù He finished his water and stood. ‚ÄúWith that, I am going to bed. Are you coming, honey?‚Äù He looked at Pepper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right there.‚Äù She watched him leave, and she turned back to the others.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am so happy for all of you. Howard was an elitist asshole and would do whatever it took to make sure nothing affected the bottom line, even if it meant hurting others. He absolutely hated me, we even had to wait until he died to get married. Anyway, Agatha, speaking of losing time, prom is the second weekend of May, and Nicky hasn‚Äôt asked Morgan yet. She‚Äôs expecting a Promposal.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda‚Äôs eyes lit up. The prom was only for juniors and seniors, but she had been looking forward to it. ‚ÄúI need to help. This is what I was made for.‚Äù Her grip was tight on Nat‚Äôs forearm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is a promposal?‚Äù Nat asked, loosening Wanda‚Äôs grip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a proposal, but for prom. It‚Äôs an elaborate way to ask someone to prom, cheesy but cute.‚Äù Rio explained. She was also excited.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was not as excited. This meant acknowledging that her baby boy was getting older. She knew it was happening, but moments like this reinforced it, and she didn‚Äôt like it. Agatha blew out a breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat does Morgan absolutely hate, and what might she like?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Returning to school that week included preparing for testing. Most upperclassmen would be testing the following week and tensions were rising. Rio wasn‚Äôt worried about the students that she taught. She knew they‚Äôd be fine. Her personal juniors, Nicky and Morgan, as she considered Morgan hers by extension now, had several exams they were taking, and she knew they would ace them all. They both studied hard, and with their parents, they learned quickly and were pre-disposed to do well academically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      All grades still had testing in May, even in private schools, although the tests were different from state testing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before all of that started, Nicky had a question to ask Morgan.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He thought about doing it at school but knew she preferred a more private moment this year. She had said she wanted everything their senior year to be big, so this year, he was going small. Though their moms had insisted it be captured on camera. Which was why they were on the basketball court at her house with Pepper filming from a window and Rio taking pictures from behind one of the garages. Morgan was in the zone, though, and didn‚Äôt even notice. While Nicky was the taller of the two, Morgan was still the more skillful and was beating him in their one-on-one game. Height did not mean better. He had fouled her, and she moved to the free-throw line. He switched the basketballs out and passed the new one to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make this one count.‚Äù Nicky dropped his eyes to the ball.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan followed his eyes down to the ball where ‚ÄòProm?‚Äô was written in gold paint pen. She looked up at him, just knowing that Nicholas Harkness, son of Agatha, had something to say.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was wearing a SHIELD football shirt and, with all the confidence that only a high school football star could possess, looked at her and asked, as smoothly as he could, ‚ÄúWill you make me the luckiest quarterback and be my MVP at prom?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan couldn‚Äôt control her laughter. She clutched the ball and doubled over from laughing so hard.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky put his hands on his hips and looked very unamused, except her laugh was contagious, and he started laughing, too. She sat down on the court, trying to catch her breath, her legs bent at the knees, elbows propped on them, with the basketball in between her feet. Nicky walked over and sat next to her, mirroring her position and facing her, his laughter dying down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWas it that bad?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She nodded, wiping tears from her eyes. ‚ÄúNicky, we‚Äôve known each other since we were four. The ball was more than enough, this was our moms, all of them, and I know it.‚Äù She waved to Rio, who had come out of hiding. ‚ÄúTo be clear, I didn‚Äôt expect anything more than ‚Äòhey, prom?‚Äô My mother wanted something. You‚Äôve gotta go really big next year, though, Harkness.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky looked at her with the wide eyes of teenage love. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to break up with me before then?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDo you plan on doing something stupid?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPlan on it? No. It might be in my DNA, though.‚Äù He was, after all, a Harkness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúMine too. Dad has a history, just like Agatha does. I love you, Nicky. We always said, even as kids, that we would go to senior prom together.‚Äù She looked at him with questioning eyes, knowing there was more there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI just know that high school sweethearts don‚Äôt always stay together. We may go to different colleges, you might find someone way better, you never forget your first love, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre each other‚Äôs last love.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky and Morgan had discussed the possibilities of their futures, especially when the first few recruitment letters had come in. They were realistic kids, and while they did not plan on breaking up, they knew the possibility existed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan put her hand on her cheek and saw the mixture of hope and sadness in his eyes. An emotion that Nicholas Harkness, son of Agatha, rarely ever had. Her own eyes were glassy, and tears threatened at the edges.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo how about this, even if we break up, which would shatter me.‚Äù She cleared the lump from her throat and continued her thought. ‚ÄúAnd as long as we aren‚Äôt dating anyone else, we will still go to prom together.‚Äù She stuck her pinky out like they had so many times growing up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAbsolutely, but we‚Äôll still be together, getting ready to go to college, whatever that looks like.‚Äù He hooked his pinky with hers, and they sealed their pact with a kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo, is that a yes?‚Äù He tilted his head to the side like a puppy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan wiped a tear aside with a finger. ‚ÄúYes, you goofball.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He hopped to his feet and offered her his hand. ‚ÄúGreat, I got you something.‚Äù He rushed over to his gym bag and pulled out two stuffed penguins. One wore a football jersey with Harkness on the back and the number 12, Nicky‚Äôs number. He handed it to Morgan and kept the other, who wore a basketball jersey with Stark on the back and Morgan‚Äôs number, 13, on it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morgan smiled, huffing a laugh, and looked up at him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou grew up surrounded by women.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pepper had come outside and now stood by Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat happened? I saw them get a little sad there.‚Äù Pepper was concerned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had heard some of the conversation and repeated it to Pepper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pepper swore. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre growing up and realizing that life isn‚Äôt perfect.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOne of the hardest lessons to learn is that life doesn‚Äôt go the way we hope, no matter how much we want it to.‚Äù Rio agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It had been a long two weeks of testing, and Agatha had been busy with wrapping filming for the TV show, as well as table reads and fittings for her other projects. Rio finally had her back for the weekend and the house to themselves. They hadn‚Äôt had much time over the past few weeks to connect, and they needed that time very much.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had always loved to be the dominant one in bed and preferred to top until Agatha came along. Rio would occasionally take control, and there were times when Agatha needed her to, but now was not one of those times.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio lay on what would soon be their bed in their bedroom. Her arms were tied together above her head so Agatha could still turn her over if she wanted to. Her ankles were free, and a silk blindfold was secure over her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay baby, traffic light system, and the safeword is kittens,‚Äù Agatha whispered in her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, unconsciously biting her lower lip and rubbing her thighs together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt even started, and my sweet girl is already needy.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha ran a hand up Rio‚Äôs thigh, Rio separating her legs for her. Agatha cupped her before pulling her hand back and giving her cunt a firm smack.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio made a delighted sound. They had been adding spicier elements to their sex life, and impact play was one of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs from when you were teasing me earlier,‚Äù Rio defended herself, knowing she didn‚Äôt need to, but she liked being vocal.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIs my sweet girl being impatient?‚Äù Agatha gave Rio another firm smack, earning another pleasurable sound.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to be patient when I know what you can do.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was already wearing her harness, complete with their newest toy that technically didn‚Äôt need a harness, but the reinforcement never hurt. It was a purple vibrating double-ended dildo that would also provide clitoral stimulation to Agatha as the wearer. The shaft had seven inches of insertable length and was three fingers in girth. It was going to be a full night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúDo you now?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha asked as she hovered above Rio on all fours and kissed her heatedly. Agatha took the tip of the strap and ran it down Rio‚Äôs slit, causing her to gasp and thrust her hips forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNuh-uh,‚Äù Agatha said, tapping Rio‚Äôs nose with the tip of her index finger. ‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio whined, yanking at her restraints.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned down and kissed Rio, knowing the strap was pushing against her, teasing. Every time it pushed against Rio, Agatha felt it and moaned, clenching around the large bulb resting against her G-spot. She so badly wanted to be ramming into Rio right now but knew she had to be patient, too. Agatha swirled her tongue around Rio‚Äôs and ran her hands up and down her body while Rio fruitlessly rutted against Agatha in an attempt to get some friction. All it did was make her wetter and more frustrated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It did, however, cause Agatha to thrust forward, moaning from stimulation against her clit and inside of her. If Agatha didn‚Äôt move back from Rio, she would come like this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She groaned at the mixed feeling as Agatha pulled back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIs my sweet girl frustrated? Trying to make me come so I‚Äôll hurry?‚Äù Agatha cocked her head to the side, caressing Rio‚Äôs cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio whimpered. ‚ÄúBaby, please.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tsked. ‚ÄúSoon, turn over for me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With Agatha‚Äôs help, Rio rolled onto her belly, still unable to see.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha dragged her nails down Rio‚Äôs back as she hissed. Agatha gave Rio‚Äôs left ass cheek a firm slap and then kissed it before doing the same thing to the other. Rio writhed against the sheets for any relief. Agatha finally slid a hand towards Rio‚Äôs pussy from behind and lightly ghosted over her clit, causing Rio to gasp.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIs that what you need, baby?‚Äù Agatha asked, leaning over her back and whispering next to her ear, causing the toy to nudge against her entrance, and hit Agatha just right.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha used two fingers to draw circles, roll, and flick across Rio‚Äôs clit in a pattern she knew would get her close, quickly. Rio had raised her hips off the bed and felt the dam inside her threatening to burst, ‚ÄúAga‚Ä¶‚Äù She started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs hand was gone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBaby!‚Äù Rio dropped flat onto her stomach.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt ask nicely, and you don‚Äôt have permission yet,‚Äù Agatha purred in her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúPlease, baby?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it,‚Äù Agatha ghosted her fingers over Rio again and then circled just one at her entrance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio released an uncontrollable low moan when Agatha pushed three fingers in and started thrusting. Rio swore at being filled so suddenly, meeting her pace and pushing her hips back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha alternated sides of Rio‚Äôs ass to occasionally spank her, just hard enough to leave a faint mark, and paid close attention to the woman beneath her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was close, and she needed to come.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBaby, Agatha, please, please, let me come,‚Äù Rio babbled between grunts, groans, and gasps.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha considered it. Rio was getting there, but not quite where she wanted her. She slowed her motions and removed her hand slowly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAlmost baby, roll back over for me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled onto her back, and Agatha took in her beauty. Rio was an absolute mess, her hair was wild, light bruises and marks across her chest from Agatha marking her earlier, and her pussy was wet and dripping.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned down to kiss her, biting Rio‚Äôs lower lip. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stunning.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say something back, but I‚Äôm blindfolded.‚Äù Rio quipped.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked. ‚ÄúI should punish you for that, brat.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed her again before moving between Rio‚Äôs legs and settling. The strap was growing uncomfortable, and she needed to use it soon. The pressure inside her was building, and she knew she was close.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Just a little longer.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha licked a long line up Rio and swirled around her clit, before dragging her tongue backward. The sounds from Rio were sinful and almost sent Agatha over the edge herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She reinserted her three fingers from before and curled them forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYes, Agatha, there, please.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thrust her hips as her muscles clenched, and Agatha knew Rio was extremely close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stopped and carefully pulled out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio screamed from frustration at the edging, even though she had consented to it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha reached up and took the blindfold off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know. You hate me.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded tears of frustration in her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stroked the purple cock, and Rio looked at it hungrily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you ready?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned back and moved closer to Rio, guiding the tip and watching it slide in easily, enjoying the small gasp that Rio emitted upon being filled. Agatha focused on Rio‚Äôs face as she moaned and pulled against her restraints.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wrapped her legs around Agatha‚Äôs waist and began to grind against her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grabbed the remote next to her that controlled the vibrations and set it on medium. She gripped Rio‚Äôs waist and began to thrust.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had been so close, Agatha knew she was holding back, and with all the movement and Rio‚Äôs reactions, she wasn‚Äôt far. She reached up and tugged on the ties to undo Rio‚Äôs restraints and turned up the speed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúBe my good girl and come for me, Rio.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha‚Äôs thrusts were hard, each one applying more pressure to the vibrations on her clit when Rio slammed her pelvis as close to Agatha‚Äôs as possible and let out a guttural cry of pleasure along with a string of words and what Agatha thought was her name.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha followed closely behind as the action provided the pressure she needed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They collapsed, and Agatha turned the device off, letting them rest for a moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She rolled them over and looked up at Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúColor?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGreen as emeralds.‚Äù Rio looked down at Agatha, a mischievous smile appearing. Rio leaned back, causing the toy to shift. She placed her hands flat on Agatha‚Äôs stomach and began to ride her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gripped Rio‚Äôs hips, allowing her to lean back and brace her hands on her ankles. Agatha groped for the remote, turning the vibrations back on. She arched her back as the stimulation reminded her how sensitive she was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sped up, and Agatha compensated, biting her lip while she watched Rio riding the purple cock. From this angle, she could watch as it entered and stretched her each time. Agatha bit her lip as Rio shuddered, and fluid escaped around the purple appendage, though Rio kept going.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was on the edge.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She ran a hand from Rio‚Äôs side and thumbed her clit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúJesus, fuck, right there.‚Äù Rio increased the speed of her thrusts as Agatha arched her back and turned the vibrations on high.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúRio, I‚Äôm‚Ä¶‚Äù Agatha wrapped a leg around Rio and used her free arm to pull her close. Agatha‚Äôs body trembled as they rode out the storm and she shattered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio followed closely behind her, and it was Rio who scrambled for the remote and turned off the overstimulating vibrations.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They lay like that for a few moments before it became too uncomfortable.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They slowly removed the toy from both of them and set it aside to clean. Rio had rolled onto her side, and Agatha handed Rio her water cup and helped her drink. After she set it back down, she noticed that Rio was staring at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to make me get up and pee, and then you‚Äôre going to help me clean up and be all sweet, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI hear that‚Äôs what you do when you care about someone, yes,‚Äù Agatha replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI hope you know you‚Äôre stuck with me.‚Äù Rio smiled, moving to get out of the bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm counting on it. Wanda started a betting pool on when I‚Äôll propose. She won‚Äôt let me play. Something about it being unfair.‚Äù Agatha walked around to Rio‚Äôs side of the bed in case she was unsteady on her feet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt even talked about marriage,‚Äù Rio said shakily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhich is why it goes out five years.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWhat does she not bet on?‚Äù Rio scoffed, trying not to think of herself marrying Agatha, though she very much wanted to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHerself, politics, the weather, and the NFL, everything else, including her children, are fair game.‚Äù Agatha walked next to Rio in the bathroom and found the wipes. Rio went to the restroom first.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed. ‚ÄúI love this family.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGood, now help me change the sheets. There‚Äôs a puddle in the middle of the bed.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>

<span>
      Rio was happy with how their life was settling. She had begun to pack up the apartment, and Raven could sense a change on the horizon. They had moved enough times that as long as she was with her human, she was fine. This time, they were just moving to her other house. The time-weathered cat had molded herself to fit inside a box and watched as Rio packed a bag for the music festival on the beach that weekend. So much had happened since she bought those tickets for Agatha in February.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre staying with Nicky this weekend. We‚Äôre trusting him at the house by himself. Did I just say we? It‚Äôs okay, I said we. We‚Äôve been a family for a while, though. Agatha has said she‚Äôs fine with this. It‚Äôs absolutely fine. It will be Nicky and the boys on the compound. Jen and Alice will be there, too, but they won‚Äôt be around much. They‚Äôre going to meet a few potential doggy cousins for you.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was walking between her closet and the suitcase and over to the dresser. Raven‚Äôs eyes followed her, inserting meows where appropriate. She hissed when dogs were mentioned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôll be just fine.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put clothes in the suitcase that sat on the bed. It was Thursday evening, and they planned to drive up to the beach house in the morning. The festival wasn‚Äôt far from the house, and they preferred to stay in a familiar space. Rio smiled as she thought of the large house overlooking the water. It was there that she and Agatha had decided to be friends, despite every fiber of her being wanting to push Agatha down in the sand and kiss the smirk off her face that very first night at the party.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even if someone had told Rio what they would go through between then and now, she would do it all again to end up here, surrounded by boxes, madly in love with Agatha Harkness, who loved her back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúLife is weird.‚Äù She said to Raven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúTalking to the wise one again?‚Äù Agatha asked, having come in undetected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave her a warm smile as Agatha walked over and gave her a quick hug and kiss on the cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOne of these days, I‚Äôm going to think you‚Äôre an intruder.‚Äù Rio turned her head and kissed Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôd let you. It could be fun.‚Äù Agatha winked.¬† She looked down at Rio‚Äôs full suitcase. ‚ÄúLove, you do not need this much clothing. It‚Äôs just us. You could walk around in just a swimsuit, underwear, or naked. I like the last option the best.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAre you ever not horny? Don‚Äôt answer that. I‚Äôve met your stuffed moose.‚Äù Rio rolled her eyes as she headed to the bathroom to gather more things.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the menopause and my extremely sexy girlfriend.‚Äù Agatha sat on the edge of the bed. ‚ÄúWanda and Nat are safely in Tahoe. Vision and Herb are on call for the boys, and Jen is grumbling about being on a compound with teenagers for the weekend.‚Äù She reported.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio walked back into the room laughing. She tossed her toiletries into the bag and zipped up the suitcase.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll live. They‚Äôre good kids. The one time they threw a party, it was the most responsible teen party in the history of house parties. If they do anything, it will be staying up all night to watch movies and play video games.‚Äù She took the handle of the suitcase and gestured toward Raven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúGet your stepcat, please, and let's go.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It didn‚Äôt take long for Rio to decide that all festivals should be held near one of Agatha‚Äôs homes. Or that they should go house shopping near other festivals. It would also give them solid vacation options. Rio lightly scolded herself. They were moving in together in a month. It was too soon to purchase real estate together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Wasn‚Äôt it?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was late Friday night, and they were lying in bed as Rio‚Äôs thoughts wandered. The first night of the festival was also playing in her head. Singing along to Train and Lenny Kravitz were the highlights.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled over and pulled Rio closer to her. ‚ÄúDo you remember Labor Day weekend?‚Äù She asked sleepily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou mean the weekend you climbed into the bed with me, and I almost died? No, not at all.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSmartass.‚ÄùAgatha placed her head on Rio‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúI knew I wanted you as more than just a friend, and I couldn‚Äôt admit it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúReally? Could have convinced me.‚Äù Rio said sarcastically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha scoffed, ‚ÄúThe only people we slightly convinced were ourselves.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúAggie, we didn‚Äôt convince ourselves. We gaslit ourselves.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up at her, her bright eyes cloudy with sleep. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre here now. I love you forever.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tucked a piece of Agatha‚Äôs unruly hair behind her ear. ‚ÄúI love you, too. Forever. Even though forever isn‚Äôt technically classifiable.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNerd.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of the weekend went by smoothly, with Agatha and Rio enjoying each other and listening to great music. They watched the sunsets paint the sky in the background and saw many of Agatha‚Äôs friends who were becoming more than just acquaintances to Rio. ¬† This was becoming Rio‚Äôs world, too, and she was becoming recognizable even without being on Agatha‚Äôs arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys back home were doing well and had not thrown any parties, according to the couple that had stayed on the compound.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      On Sunday night, it was finally time for Alanis to perform. It was Agatha‚Äôs favorite set of the entire weekend, and she sang each song as though she personally had written the lyrics. In some cases, she had helped. Agatha and Alanis had connected before the set, and they exchanged many knowing looks during the performance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn‚Äôt jealous at all, she kept telling herself, though she did make sure she was glued to Agatha‚Äôs side.
     </span>
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Prom was a few days away, and while Nicky was looking forward to it, Morgan‚Äôs birthday was the following Tuesday, and he had no idea what to get her. He‚Äôd been getting Morgan something every year since they had turned five, but it was always the latest toy, a gift card, a trending item or gadget, something you would get a friend. This year, he wanted to do something meaningful but was unsure of what. He didn‚Äôt want to do jewelry. No, they weren‚Äôt there yet. He had already given her the promposal stuffed toy penguins. He knew it needed to be something personal, and he knew just the woman to talk to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was sixth period and Rio‚Äôs planning time. Nicky easily obtained permission to speak with Ms. Vidal during sixth period, and he took all of his things and left, Morgan watching him suspiciously as he walked out of Mrs. Wu-Kale‚Äôs AP History class.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky stuck his head in the open door, looking for the woman whose advice he was seeking, spotting her at her desk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúHey, Ms. Vidal, can I talk to you for a moment?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked up and smiled at the teenage boy with his mop of chestnut curls that reminded her of his mother‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOf course, honey,‚Äù the endearment slipping out. ‚ÄúAre you hungry? I have snacks.‚Äù Rio always kept snacks for herself and used them as random incentives or when a kid needed a boost during the day.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm good, thanks.‚Äù He placed a stool on the other side of her desk and sat down. ‚ÄúI need some help with something, and I think you‚Äôd be a good person to ask.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stopped what she was doing and looked up at him. He looked nervous and was fidgeting in his seat. Nicky was usually confident, like Agatha, and took command in most situations. Also, like Agatha, he didn‚Äôt often ask for help.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNicholas, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Rio‚Äôs worry emerged and she questioned if she needed to text for reinforcements.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs wrong, no. Morgan‚Äôs birthday is next Tuesday, and I‚Äôm clueless. I want to get something that says I love you, but teenage appropriate.‚Äù He tapped his foot on the rung of the stool nervously. Rio breathed a sigh of relief.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOh! Well, I do know Morgan well, being her coach, but Nicky, you‚Äôve known her most of your life. This isn‚Äôt the first birthday or Christmas you‚Äôve exchanged gifts. What have you gotten her so far in your relationship?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn‚Äôt sure why Nicky had chosen her, of all people to ask for advice on this. She had difficulty coming up with gifts for Agatha, and it took her some serious contemplation to finally land on the right one. She had never done well in relationships as a teen and young adult, and kids didn‚Äôt make mix tapes and CDs anymore. If anything, Wanda or Nat would be great people to ask.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky blew out a breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúUmm, Christmas, I got her a gift card for a sports store, and for Valentine‚Äôs Day, it was flowers, chocolate, and a giant bear.‚Äù He grimaced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio suppressed a smile, even though her eyes brightened. ‚ÄúOh, Nicholas. I can see now why you‚Äôre asking for advice,‚Äù She gave him a playful smile and saw him relax. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt always have to give her something tangible. Your mother and I have exchanged material items, yes, but we have also given each other experiences and memories, like concerts and trips.‚Äù She clarified upon seeing the scandalized look on his face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky seemed to think it over for a moment before looking back at her, still thinking, ‚ÄúOkay, well, we‚Äôre still teenagers, so there‚Äôs only so much we can do, and I have to get Pepper and Mr. Stark‚Äôs permission to take her anywhere, and your‚Äôs and Mom‚Äôs of course.‚Äù He added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt as though her heart did somersaults when Nicky said he needed both of their permission to do something. While they acknowledged that she was somewhat of a parental figure, she did not have that authority. This would need to be discussed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt depends on what and where it is,‚Äù Rio said cautiously. ‚ÄúWhat does she like?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSports, music, surfing, we like a lot of the same things.‚Äù Nicky shrugged, trying to think of something they didn‚Äôt do a lot or hadn‚Äôt done before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew this needed to be his idea, and didn‚Äôt want to just supply the answer for him, but she had an idea.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThe WNBA season is starting very soon, maybe look that up.‚Äù Rio knew it was starting the Friday after Morgan‚Äôs birthday, but she wasn‚Äôt telling him that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt does? Does LA have a team?‚Äù Nicky asked innocently. He followed college basketball and was getting more into the professional leagues. Morgan had mentioned to Rio that she wanted Nicky to watch more of the women‚Äôs league with her this year.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Nicky and shrugged, silently telling him to do this part himself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky understood her nonverbal cues and pulled his phone out of his pocket, tapping the screen quickly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI found it! I wonder if I can get courtside seats and take her.‚Äù Nicky‚Äôs eyes lit up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou should give Pepper a call. She‚Äôll talk to Tony, and then we can all talk about it tonight.‚Äù Rio thought for a moment. She still wasn‚Äôt sure why he had asked her. She looked at the clock, noting they still had a few minutes and everything was ready for her next class. ‚ÄúHey, why ask me? Surely your mom is way better versed in this type of thing.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky gave her a soft smile as he stood. ‚ÄúSeveral reasons. You know Morgan and the two of you have some things in common. I know you‚Äôre going to be direct with me. Mom would tell me to ask my aunts or you, Aunt Wanda would go with something sappy, and Aunt Nat would go with either a weapon or defer to Aunt Wanda. One year, I did give Morgan a personalized pocket knife. She still has it. Mr. Stark makes her carry it on our dates,‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúThe main reason, though, is you‚Äôre my other mom, Rio. Why wouldn‚Äôt I ask you?‚Äù With that, the bell rang, and he waved and disappeared, leaving her to process that and teach simultaneously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Kids.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pepper agreed to the game, and Tony knew the team's owner, making it easier for Nicky to get tickets. All he needed to do was ask Agatha that night. Rio was also there as they discussed it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first game of the season. We‚Äôll be there too.‚Äù Rio was saying to Agatha. She knew Agatha didn‚Äôt have a problem with it and was just making Nicky sweat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe will?‚Äù Agatha threw a look at her girlfriend, who was sitting on the couch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll be there. I‚Äôll take Alice if you don‚Äôt want to go.‚Äù Rio continued to grade papers, unbothered by the other woman‚Äôs question.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll go.‚Äù She turned back to Nicky, who sat, alert, on another couch. ‚ÄúOkay, you can go. Just be very alert sitting courtside, and be a gentleman. It‚Äôs a late game, so you‚Äôll have to go with us or a driver.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky frowned. It was the first time Rio had ever seen Nicky upset with a condition that Agatha had set. He looked over at Rio with a hopeful look on his face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI agree. I know your mom has let you drive at night by yourself before, but this is different. It‚Äôs late, in a busy area, after a large event, in traffic. Not only is it against the terms of your license, it‚Äôs just not safe yet, Nicky. You‚Äôll both be tired, and this way, you can talk or anything else.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had wanted to interject before Rio had responded but was impressed with Rio‚Äôs response. Nicky huffed, knowing if he didn‚Äôt accept the terms, it wouldn‚Äôt happen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he grumbled before adjusting his attitude when he saw the warning looks from each of them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going upstairs to get all that sorted out like the responsible and respectful young man I am. Thank you for the idea, Ri.‚Äù He turned on his heel and retreated upstairs before either mom could change their mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned to Rio and rolled her lips. She wasn‚Äôt exactly upset, but Nicky had always come to her with things, and knowing he had gone to someone else had tied her stomach into a small knot. ‚ÄúHe asked you for advice?‚Äù There was a shadow of hurt in her tone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took Agatha‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúYes, I should have told you. He came to me today and asked me what he should get for Morgan. I asked him why he had asked me when there were three other women to ask. Agatha, he said I‚Äôm his other mom.‚Äù Rio‚Äôs eyes filled with tears at the words she hadn‚Äôt quite processed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled genuinely, though she was just as conflicted as she had been a few months ago. ‚ÄúI know he‚Äôs made references to it a few times, I‚Äôm just still getting used to sharing him with someone I‚Äôm romantically involved with. Decisions, what little discipline he requires, advice, and whatever else is needed. I know I‚Äôve shared these things with the others, but this is different.‚Äù Agatha‚Äôs thumb drew circles on the back of Rio‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be out of the country for over half of the summer and away from both of you. I know he has several invitations to schools for visits and a few football camps.‚Äù Agatha paused, gathering the words. She knew she would be asking a lot of Rio. ‚ÄúYou can say no, but since you‚Äôll be living here, and he considers you a parent, would you go on his visits with him and share everything with me? It‚Äôs ultimately his decision, but I‚Äôd still like to know information about the programs, how the trips were, and both of your thoughts. I want to know that he is with someone I trust to guide him. I know you have the best intentions in mind for him, like I do.‚Äù Agatha looked hopeful as she looked into Rio‚Äôs eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn‚Äôt sure how to respond. Agatha wanted her to go through this crucial milestone with Nicky? ‚ÄúOf course. Your summer is busy enough. I do have his best intentions at heart, and yours.‚Äù She leaned forward and kissed Agatha slowly, placing her palm over Agatha‚Äôs heart. ‚ÄúI love you both, very much,‚Äù Rio whispered when she drew back and dropped her forehead to Agatha‚Äôs shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúWe love you too.‚Äù The knot in Agatha‚Äôs stomach had dissipated, and she knew that this was right. Rio was the person with whom she wanted to co-parent Nicky or any future children.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Prom night, like all high school milestones, was a ritual Morgan had been looking forward to. Her dress was a one-shoulder, gold-sequined, floor-length gown with three straps across the back for extra support so she wasn‚Äôt tugging it up all night. Her hair was in an up-do and her dad wanted her to wear a scarf because of it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky wore a tux with a gold vest and bowtie. Both sequined, he was committed to matching. His moms had insisted on tagging along to the Starks so they could take pictures. It meant as much to Nicky that Rio was there for this, too, like a second primary mother. She loved him, and even if neither woman wanted to admit it, he knew Agatha and Rio would get married eventually. He saw how worried she had been when he got in that fight, and when he had gotten in that car accident. That wasn‚Äôt the look of a concerned teacher or family friend. That was the look of a worried parent. Right now both of them were beaming at him as they took pictures of the young couple dressed in their sparkly prom attire.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The parents finally let them go on their way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked over at Agatha and Tony. ‚ÄúDid either of you tell them Chappell was performing?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúNow, why would we ruin that surprise?‚Äù Agatha took Rio‚Äôs hand to lead her to the car.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI promised her I wouldn‚Äôt let anyone know she was here.‚Äù Tony and Agatha had both pulled the strings for their special guest, Tony had kept her under the radar.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pepper pat him on the back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúYou did a great job, honey.‚Äù She looked at the two women as she guided Tony toward the house. ‚ÄúI had to take his phone away so he didn‚Äôt tell everyone.‚Äù
     </span>

<span>
      The last week of school was showcase week and to Rio, each day brought with it a fresh new hell. Thankfully, the last day of school was Thursday, and Friday they were all going to the beach house for Memorial Day weekend.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio and Alice had already taken care of their end-of-the-year duties and would be able to leave as soon as the bell rang on Thursday. First, they had to get through four days of student exhibits and showcases.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky, Tommy, and Eddie were playing in a football scrimmage -Tommy and Eddie would be playing on varsity the next year. For the football events, Agatha and Rio wore matching ‚ÄúFootball Mom‚Äù shirts that both read Harkness on the back with Nicky‚Äôs number. Nat‚Äôs shirt had Maximoff on the back with Tommy‚Äôs number, and Herb wore a ‚ÄúFootball Dad‚Äù shirt, but whose back matched Nat‚Äôs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy wore his Football Boyfriend shirt with pride.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Academic and fine arts projects were on display, and both Rio and Alice were very proud of their student's hard work throughout the year, specifically the students of the coven. Tommy‚Äôs grades had improved immensely and his projects demonstrated it. Cassie had a lot to do with that, she encouraged Tommy to study and she found ways to make it fun for him. Wanda didn‚Äôt ask questions.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The basketball team also had a scrimmage and a teachers vs. students game. Agatha wore her Vidal jersey and cheered extra loudly when she watched Rio play. Rio was not nice to the girls at all, and the teachers won easily. Morgan grumbled the whole time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia laughed as she watched, she knew Rio had won a National Championship in college. The girls didn't.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy showed off his talent by doing a one-act play and a choir concert where he had a lead part and a solo. Wanda and Agatha were so proud. Jen already had a few people in mind to call about the kid.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was finally Thursday and as Rio locked her classroom door, ending her first year at SHIELD, she looked forward to the future. This weekend was going to be all about beach time. Then she would move in with Agatha the following week.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio walked to her car, confidently optimistic for the future.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha watched her family from the balcony of the beach house during the first weekend of summer. It was the calm before the whirlwind of summer filming, and they had all gathered to kick it off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The teens were in the ocean and the boys were attempting to show off their surfing skills and doing terribly. She couldn‚Äôt make out expressions from where she stood, but she could tell that Morgan and Cassie were laughing as Tommy wiped out. Billy had snuck up behind Eddie and dunked him. The kids were being kids, and it warmed her heart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Directly below her by the pool; Vision, Alice, Nat, and Herb were drinking, grilling, and laughing while Wanda, Jen, and Rio were planning the Maximoff-Romanov wedding that was only a few weeks away now. Agatha was ecstatic that the wedding, which had been twenty-five years in the making, would finally be happening. Wanda looked on the edge of joyful tears as she continuously looked at Nat and Vision. The two people who had come together and supported her throughout everything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And Herb. Herb who had been Vision‚Äôs friend for as long as any of them had known Vision. Wanda‚Äôs worries about someone coming into Vision‚Äôs life and not understanding the relationship between them completely dissipated once Herb entered the picture. This teddy bear of a man didn‚Äôt mind the pecks on the cheek and forehead the exes gave each other or the pet names. They were close friends, and co-parents that still loved each other. Wanda and Vision didn‚Äôt divorce because they didn‚Äôt love each other, they divorced each other because they did, and Herb understood that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The man, like Nat, was a national treasure.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had come into this life, born to a woman who did not want her. She became famous at an extremely young age based entirely on luck and was still convinced that her fame was the only reason Evanora had not killed her when she was a young child. She had met Lorna Wu as a pre-teen, and the woman took pity on her, hatching a plan to save her from her circumstances, and she had.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lorna Wu had taught Agatha what family was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It had gone off track a time or two, and she had lost people along the way and gained so many. Nearly forty years later, and here she was, Lorna gone, but her legacy lived on. Agatha and Lilia were restoring their relationship, and Lilia, her rightful place in the family.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Alice had grown closer and had a deeper understanding of each other, as well as Lorna. Agatha looked on and caught Jen watching Alice with pure love in her eyes. Agatha knew Jen had her own skeletons and only let certain people in. She had been so hesitant about taking the leap with Alice, even though they could all see the love between them. Now, here they were, married, living on the compound, about to adopt a dog. Alice turned to see Jen watching her and walked over to join the planning group, bending down to kiss her wife.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was filled with a comfortable warmth watching all of them and the familiar pang of Lorna‚Äôs absence. It didn‚Äôt hurt like it had in the past, it was just the awareness that she wasn‚Äôt physically there. Having Lilia back had eased the pain. Having two-thirds of the original trio back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had been in a staggering amount of movies, TV shows, commercials, plays, and musicals. She was no stranger to various genres of entertainment. She knew that life imitated art, and if you asked her which genre was her favorite, she would tell you it was life. After all, her life had everything. Romance, mystery, intrigue, murder, angst, anything you wanted, and a lot of things she hadn‚Äôt but was better for. Rio looked up and raised her water bottle toward her in a small toast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha raised hers back and smiled lovingly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned her head as Lilia walked up behind her as if Lilia had been summoned by her thoughts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúSo, you and Sharon?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia chuckled. ‚ÄúI was wondering when you were going to ask.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúThat woman is in love with you.‚Äù Agatha leaned forward and rested her forearms on the railing in front of her. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre in love with her, or as close as Lilia Calderu has ever come to it. I‚Äôve seen how you look at her.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia hummed. ‚ÄúI remember someone telling me that once before, about a woman being in love with me. I lost my two best friends because of it.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stood to her full height and put a comforting hand on Lilia‚Äôs shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚Äú That was then, this is now, and you‚Äôre not that person anymore. You‚Äôre older and wiser. I know you‚Äôre only dating women now, and I know she‚Äôs the only one, you‚Äôre also the only person she‚Äôs seeing.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia smirked and raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWell, look who took a page from Wanda‚Äôs playbook.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI am not meddling. Call it a welfare check if you must.‚Äù Agatha dropped her hand from Lilia‚Äôs shoulder, taking Lilia‚Äôs hand instead. ‚ÄúLils, I‚Äôm not saying shack up and get married, I‚Äôm saying give her a chance and let her in. She‚Äôs a great woman. She put up with a very angry me when I broke my leg, remember? She also put up with me multiple times trying to detox with Lorna. She can handle your not-so-law-abiding self.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia but the inside of her lip. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a tough woman, I know she can. But monogamy? Neither of us has been monogamous since the seventies, Agatha.‚Äù Lilia looked as though Agatha had asked her to impale herself with swords.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed at the thought of either woman in a completely traditional relationship. ‚ÄúNo, I would never suggest either of you do that. I‚Äôm saying make each other a primary relationship, the majority of your love lives. Whatever that looks like for you two. More than just a few weekends a year, Lilia.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it. Neither one of us has said the L word, and we‚Äôve been, having our fun, for years now.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha squeezed Lilia‚Äôs hand before letting it go. ‚ÄúGood, I just want what‚Äôs best for you,‚Äù she parroted Lilia‚Äôs words back to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúI know, kid. I know.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned back on the railing, something about the tone around the familiar phrase Lilia loved to use nagging at the back of her mind. She had to ask Lilia, who also leaned on the railing beside her. Agatha looked at her, considering everything she knew about her old mentor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‚ÄúIt was you, wasn‚Äôt it? Not Nat. Every single time something needed to be handled?‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia gave a wry smile. ‚ÄúNever send a Russian to do an Italian job.‚Äù
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head as she left Lilia at the railing, smiling the whole time, knowing that Lilia had still always been there throughout the years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She joined everyone by the pool and seated herself behind Rio, letting the gorgeous woman lean back into her chest as she would a chair. Wrapping her arms around Rio, Agatha gave her a chaste kiss and looked at her family around her. She knew that this was exactly where Lorna had wanted them to be, and that warmed her heart all the more.

<p>
     Hello lovely readers!
     <br/>
     While posting, I kept saying I was going to update the first few chapters.
     <br/>
     Well, I did that. Today (May 6th, 2025), I updated chapters one through five. They are amazing and added quite a few words...
     <br/>
     I have updates for other chapters too, especially six, but it's not ready to be posted yet. I added the scene of Alice asking Jen out, and it's cute y'all.
    </p>
<p>
     But Ellen (my pen name), what did you change/add/edit?
     <br/>
     Well, I know the first several chapters were without a beta/editor (DaretoDream82). Because of that, they were rushed and I was still very rusty in my return to writing. We have more inner dialogue, more character development, just
     <em>
      more
     </em>
     . The first part feels more like the rest of the fic. I also just working on continuity issues as a whole.
     <br/>
     ALSO, for those that did not follow the series, it IS a series now! I'm working on the next chapters for those right now. Good Luck Babe, the prequel of sorts, and I am Your Summer, the short mini-fic before the full-blown sequel.
     <br/>
     I was hoping to post for Agatha All Along week, but I may just keep on with what I'm doing, we'll see what happens.
     <br/>
     I will post updates as I update more chapters!
     <br/>
     PLEASE ENJOY THE NEWLY IMPROVED 1-5!
