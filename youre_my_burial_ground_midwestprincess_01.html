<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Rio raised her chin, her face relaxing in disinterest. “So why are you only pinching me now?”</p>
<p>“I needed an eye witness actually <i>seeing</i> you in action.” She titled her head, her gaze curious roaming over Rio’s body. “I’ll give it to you, your sleight of hand isn’t half bad.” Her free hand came to Rio’s thigh, slowly trailing upwards. “And you can’t necessarily swap cards without doing a little counting too, right? That takes some skill, hon.”</p>
<p>Rio’s tongue felt heavy, the warmth of this woman’s touch was spreading across her skin like delicious pin pricks. “I don’t know what you mean,” Rio sweetly lied.</p>
<p>“Mmmh,” she hummed, her fingertips skating underneath the hem of Rio’s skirt. There was a rough tug followed by the sharp <i>snap</i> of her garter. The owner held up the cards in show. “You’re a terrible liar for your line of work, baby.”</p>

<p><i>“Good afternoon, Las Vegans! We are coming at you with your two o’clock afternoon weather relay. It’s a scorching 106 degrees out there on this beautiful day, June 2nd, 1988. Reallyyyy makes you remember that Vegas ain’t just the city of sin, it’s also a literal desert. Now, don’t let the heat scare you just yet because it’s also bone dry out there. Remember, vodka isn’t water, so drink up folks! Next up on the docket is, very fittingly, the 1981 classic–Burnin’ For You by Blue Öyster Cul-”</i></p><p>Rio shot out her hand blindly, attempting to silence the damn clock radio. The thing clattered to the floor as the music started, causing her to groan as she peeled her damp face from the pillow. She kicked off the last of the sheets, waking up to her whole body saturated in sweat and salt. The sun spliced through the window of her trailer, the afternoon rays blinding her eyes as she tried to pry them open. She flopped onto her back, the piss poor excuse of an AC barely sputtering out lukewarm air. Fuck, she needed to replace that— maybe when she won the lottery.</p><p>Her feet wobbled as they met the ground, her head pounding with yet another hangover. She stumbled around her various house plants, almost twisting her ankle and simultaneously smacking her head on the hanging spider plant on the journey to the bathroom. After washing off yesterday’s makeup and brushing her teeth, she took a shower to shock her system. Cold, ice fucking cold, water trailed down her body while she tried to hold back her vomit. One’s late twenties are very different from one’s mid twenties. She hit twenty-seven, and suddenly liquor actually made her feel like shit. The fridge was predictably barren when she attempted to feed herself, she slammed the door shut. Fine, she’d wait until she went out later.</p><p>The mobile home might’ve been cramped, but considering she was only one person, it worked. She methodically did her makeup, having learned early on that the thicker her eyeliner, the easier men are to trick. Rio enjoyed her femininity but definitely used it to her advantage— specifically to swindle idiots. It wasn’t her weapon and by no means did she fit into the ‘maneater’ stereotype à la Hall &amp; Oates, but men trusted a pretty girl— and that made them easier to trick. Her hair fell into perfect waves down her back, giving the allure that they were effortless even though teased her roots for about half an hour and used half a can of <i>Aquanette</i> for volume. Her lips were dusted a rich pink, matching with the blush on the high points of her cheeks. Her lashes were long and full, enhancing the amber and gold that swirled in her irises. It was all manicured for maximum impact, and to her credit, it usually worked.</p><p>Rio opted for a black sleeveless tank, forgoing a bra because it was another means of distraction. She finagled the matching black mini skirt over her hips before securing the garter belt beneath, shoving a few helpful playing cards in between the band and her thigh. Unless someone had their hands up her skirt, nobody would be the wiser of what she had stowed under. And since she was not going to a dyke bar tonight, she wouldn’t have to worry about the possibility of that happening. Rio finished off the ensemble with some stilettos, grabbing her bag and hoops as she opened her front door.</p><p>“Rio,” her landlord greeted from the bottom step. “I was just looking for you.”</p><p>She pushed one hoop through her ear, slinging her purse over her shoulder. “Tony.” Her smile was weak, but if she played dumb, maybe he’d fuck off. “Hot one today, huh?”</p><p>“Rent was due yesterday, and yet-” He held up his empty hands. “I have no rent from you.”</p><p>God, if he wasn’t staring right at her, she’d roll her eyes. “Really? Could’ve sworn I dropped it off. Weird.” She fastened her other hoop, locking the door behind her as she made her way down the steps past Tony. “Sure you didn’t lose my check?”</p><p>“I didn’t have a check to lose,” he said, staring her down. “I’m not running a charity. You want to keep your lot, you’ll have that $200 to me by tomorrow.”</p><p>“C’mon man.” She dug around in her purse, pulling out her lighter and pack. Rio perched the cigarette between her lips as the flame flickered. “We do this every month. I’m late with the rent, you threaten to tow my house-”</p><p>“I will-”</p><p>“I get you the money and the cycle starts all over.” Rio tossed her shit back into her bag, taking a drag. “You know I’m good for it.”</p><p>His eyes raked over her cautiously. “And yet I still don’t know what you do for work.”</p><p>Rio grinned, walking backwards as she gave him a small salute as a farewell. “It’s Vegas, I do what everyone does.”</p><p>“Prostitution?” He speculated, somewhere between hopeful and curious.</p><p>She whipped around, strutting down the dirt road on her way out of the trailer park. “Like you could afford me!”</p><p>For the record, she was <i>not</i> a prostitute, but that wasn’t an uncommon assumption for most young, beautiful women in this city. No, what Rio did was play to win, and sometimes that meant stacking the deck. Okay, it meant <i>always</i> stacking the deck. The problem with her job, however, was that income was…unreliable. She was smart, she never hit the same casino twice in one week, never used her real name, and most importantly–she kept moving. There were over 30 casino resorts on the strip alone, and if she ever really got desperate, she conned people at local bars with pool.</p><p>Vegas was a place that was easy to get lost in. The booze, the gambling, the drugs–every vice satiated to one’s hedonistic desires. It also meant that if she robbed a man blind, he most likely wouldn’t remember her face the next morning. It wasn’t her fault men are so incredibly dimwitted, she was an opportunist. Petty crime was not her first career choice, she had a degree, one that now collected dust. But, she had to get the fuck out of Florida. She was trying to originally reach California all those years ago, but beggars can’t be choosers. And a person on the run or in hiding didn’t get to be picky, at least here, she was a needle in a haystack. Plus, a bachelor’s degree in botany from the University of Miami wasn’t going to get her any richer than cheating at cards. Damn you, Ronald Reagan.</p><p>Rio exhaled the smoke as she trekked to the end of the path, her heels clacking against the hot asphalt of the road. The trailer park was just off of the strip, an easy fifteen minute walk to civilization. Outside of the city was a highway and sand until you got to the <i>next</i> city.  She put on her sunglasses, grimacing as she smoked. That radio wasn’t lying, the tourists were all going to look like lobsters by sundown. Her cigarette burned down to the filter, though she waited until she reached the strip to flick the butt into the nearest garbage can. Global warming was absolutely real, NASA had said so, and Rio would not have that shit on her conscience.</p><p>The wafting scent of fried food hit her nose, reminding her that it was now 5PM and she had yet to eat. The north end of the strip always had some kind of food cart, she just had to watch and wait for someone to bait. She pushed her sunglasses to sit atop her head, locking her sights on a drunk guy in his twenties going for the pretzel stand. See? Dimwits.</p><p>Rio cut in front of him while he was digging in his wallet, bumping his shoulder to make him drop the cheap leather billfold to the ground. “Oh my god,” she gasped, feigning embarrassment. “I am <i>so</i> sorry!” Rio bent down, grabbing the wallet while he simply blinked. She quickly turned to the vendor, her hands out of sight as she fished out whatever cash he had stuffed in there. “Please, let me buy his too.”</p><p>Rio closed the wallet, tucking the majority of the bills in the waistband of her skirt. She handed it back, innocently smiling. “My bad, I’ve had a few.”</p><p>She was completely sober.</p><p>“No worries,” the guy slurred back, some faint white powder just below his right nostril.</p><p>Rio gave him a reluctant pat on the shoulder, “Okay, great,” and kept on fucking moving. She idly heard the vendor calling out, “Lady, did you want the pretzels or not?”</p><p>She did not, because if she did this a couple more times, she could buy a proper dinner. Sometimes she’d pull the old ‘glass in my food’ bit to get her meal comped, but after a while, it got stale and the casinos caught on. Rio had her pick night after night of which casino she’d linger in until the sun rose, but her favorite was <i>The Belladonna.</i> Not just out of appreciation for the plant, but because of the ambiance. Where a lot of joints on the strip went wrong was the aesthetic, <i>Caesar's Palace</i> was a gaudy crime with the way it was decorated. But The Belladonna had these rich textures of royal purples and deep greens, brushed gold accents, moon phases carved into the doors. The wall paper of the main casino floor was an endless sea of navy with almost invisible constellations patterned all over. It was intimate where other places were flashy.</p><p>Not to say it was any less popular, it was one of the higher end businesses, often catering to the ultra wealthy who had nothing but money and time to burn. Vegas was a wormhole for rich assholes, a city covered in glitter to attract morons while just below the surface was a pit of debauchery. And those types of one percenters liked that, they fucking loved it. The Belladonna’s slogan was literally: <i>Games, Girls, and Booze–Pick Your Poison!</i> Rio always found the double entendre of a place called The Belladonna telling its patrons to pick their poison kind of amusing, even if most people wouldn’t pick up on it. It was owned by the Harkness family, like an actual family, not a crime one. Well, there were whispers of it, but nothing concrete.</p><p>By 7PM, Rio had skimmed enough to earn herself a nice supper in the steakhouse located within The Belladonna resort and casino. She was a vegetarian, but fuck, if they didn’t make a delicious vodka penne. After pocketing a few dinner rolls and paying the bill, she gravitated towards the action. Switching into character, Rio timidly found an open poker table. The other participants were all middle aged men in suits who were already tipsy with a cigar or a cigarette dangling from their lips, a typical bunch. As their eyes landed on her, most of them snickered or shook their heads.</p><p>That was a good thing, being underestimated is what made the cheating easy. At this moment, being a dumb woman was all she needed to pay her fucking rent. She slung her bag over the back of her hair, twirling her hair as the cards were dealt. Men often didn’t perceive women as a threat, and at this moment, their misogyny worked in her favor. Honestly, it was quite startling, it was almost the nineties, at some point men would have to realize just how fucking insulting that was…right? Burgeoning new decade aside, Rio eyed her cards, quickly peeking at the men’s reactions to their own.</p><p>A man in a tan suit sighed— dead on arrival. The balding one two chairs down raised his brows— a playable hand. The salt n’ pepper guy next to her actually fucking smirked. Her own cards were fine, nothing she couldn’t fix. But Rio liked to hedge her bets, she liked some security. Rio peeked over at the man next to her, blushing. “Um, can I ask you a question?”</p><p>“Sure, honey,” he condescended. “Never played before?”</p><p>She shook her head, giving a reserved laugh. “I’m not from around here, thought it could be fun.”</p><p>“Tourist?”</p><p>Nope.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, batting her eyelashes. “What do those cards in the middle of the table mean?”</p><p>He chuckled, taking a puff off his cigar. “Just watch me, you’ll pick it up.”</p><p>“You’ll help me?” She gushed, placing her hand on his shoulder. “You’re an angel! I’m not even tipsy enough to try and act like I understand what’s happening.”</p><p>And right on cue-</p><p>“Well we should fix that, let me buy you a drink.”</p><p>Stupid, stupid man.</p><p>“You’re sweet.” Rio flagged down a cocktail waitress and gave her drink order. “Triple whiskey, neat, top shelf.”</p><p>The man pulled a credit card out of his inner jacket pocket. “You can start a tab.”</p><p>Near the end of the game, Rio laughed at the man’s dumb joke, her hand below the table deftly switching out the cards. She always marked them to know which one was which without having to look–the one marked with half a nail indention was the queen of hearts. Rio swapped it with her seven of spades, sipping her whiskey and biting her lower lip while pretending to listen. The mechanics of hustling men was smooth, seamless really. Rio threw down her cards, fawning as she said, “Royal straight?”</p><p>The man next to her cocked his head. “It’s a royal <i>flush.</i>”</p><p>“We have a winner.” The dealer pushed the stack of chips towards her.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath through her teeth, widening her eyes as she collected her winnings. “Ain’t lady luck just a bitch…”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “Wait-”</p><p>She knocked back the rest of the booze, slamming down the glass. “Thanks for the help.” Rio would’ve normally stayed to play a few more rounds, maybe even tried her luck at some roulette. But she’d won rent and then some, and couldn’t risk leaving empty handed, although that didn’t mean she couldn’t have fun. She walked through the casino, swiftly ducking her hand into the pockets of suit jackets on the backs of chairs. The people who owned said jackets were too enthralled in whichever game they were playing to even notice. Several designer wallets now safely nestled in her purse along with the chips she still had to cash out.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio simpered as she approached the bar. “My husband started a tab, I’d like to order something else.”</p><p>The bartender, an obvious lesbian with a mullet and red streaks dyed throughout her hair, raised her brows. Her eyes fell onto the man that Rio was pointing to, then looked at Rio. “May/December thing, huh.”</p><p>“I like my men older...” Rio read her nametag. “Alice. What can I say?”</p><p>“Your husband know you’re a dyke?” Alice deadpanned.</p><p>Her face fell. “What?”</p><p>Alice pointed to the tattoo on Rio’s left bicep. “You have an armband barbed wire motif inked onto you, your middle and index fingers have shorter nails, and nothing about the way you ‘flirted’ with that man screamed heterosexuality.”</p><p>Rio’s pulse skyrocketed, and not because Alice had just read her to a tee. No, if Alice noticed the flirting, how much more did she notice? “You were <i>watching</i> me?”</p><p>“I was.” She tilted her head as she gave an impolite smile. “Which is how I know you were cheating.” Alice then signaled with her hand before fixing her vest.</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about-”</p><p>“Oh, sure you do.” A honeyed voice behind her whispered, followed by fingers coiling around her arm. “My office. Now.”</p><p>Rio didn’t get a chance to see the person dragging her away, it was all big, permed, hair coiled into bodied curls and a wrinkled half-suit. The button up had a couple undone at the very top to display a little collarbone, pinstripe slacks, loafers, and suspenders. Actually, the loafers were lifts which was fucking hilarious because the other woman was still a couple inches shorter than her.</p><p>She was shoved into an office, hideous laminate flooring, dark wood desk, a singular green desk lamp illuminating the space, and a strangely plush couch against the far wall. For how upscale the joint was, this room felt oddly seedy. The woman slammed the door, rounding Rio as she finally let go of her arm. As she stepped in front of Rio, she actually got a better look at the woman accosting her. Blue eyes that swirled with pale green in the iris, a nose that looked like it was carved by the goddesses, sharp jawline, chiseled cheek bones, thick brows. For all the planes and angles, there was something soft about her face all put together, and a heaviness behind the orbs currently staring into her soul. There was a delicacy there, soaked and saturated in a curated front, but a delicacy nonetheless.</p><p>The woman licked her bottom lip, tilting her head in annoyance. “You wanna tell me what you were doing in my casino?”</p><p><i>Her</i> casino?</p><p>Rio smirked, coyly answering, “My job…?”</p><p>The other woman’s voice was gruff, an almost soothing timber accentuating her words. “Cheating and stealing your regular gig?”</p><p>Rio leaned against the door since she was being cornered in anyway. “Have you been watching me?” She purred, flattered at the insinuation. “What part of casino ownership constitutes voyeurism?"</p><p>“Listen, I can appreciate conning men. Respect it, even.” The woman leaned in. “But not in <i>my</i> establishment. You think people are gonna come back and spend more money if they’ve already lost <i>all</i> their money?”</p><p>“Seems like a really fragile business model…” Rio frowned in faux sympathy.</p><p>The other woman’s hand shot out, landing on the door, right next to Rio’s head with a sharp <i>smack.</i> “I’ve been tracking you for six months, you know? The cameras in every corner of the casino floor are real, by the way.”</p><p>Rio raised her chin, her face relaxing in disinterest. “So why are you only pinching me now?”</p><p>“I needed an eye witness actually <i>seeing</i> you in action.” She titled her head, her gaze curious roaming over Rio’s body. “I’ll give it to you, your sleight of hand isn’t half bad.” Her free hand came to Rio’s thigh, slowly trailing upwards. “And you can’t necessarily swap cards without doing a little counting too, right? That takes some skill, hon.”</p><p>Rio’s tongue felt heavy, the warmth of this woman’s touch was spreading across her skin like delicious pin pricks. “I don’t know what you mean,” Rio sweetly lied.</p><p>“Mmmh,” she hummed, her fingertips skating underneath the hem of Rio’s skirt. There was a rough tug followed by the sharp <i>snap</i> of her garter. The owner held up the cards in show. “You’re a terrible liar for your line of work, baby.”</p><p>“Men are easier fools,” Rio grumbled back, ignoring her hammering pulse. And no, her heart wasn’t racing because she was intimidated, it was more than that.</p><p>“You buy these at the gift shop?”</p><p>“Stole.” Not her fault that they sold decks with the hotel’s emblem that were identical to the ones used by the staff dealers.</p><p>“Right.” The cards were carelessly thrown to the floor. “What’s your name?”</p><p>“You wanna guess?” Rio wiggled her brows, biting her lower lip.</p><p>The woman reached behind her, her lithe fingers wrapping around the handle of her gun tucked in her waistband. From what Rio could see, it was a revolver, a custom piece with vines and florals engraved throughout, with what looked to be an ivory grip. Hurting an innocent animal for the sake of a firearm might’ve been the most gauche thing Rio had ever witnessed. “No, frankly, you’re starting to piss me off.”</p><p>Shocker, someone in Nevada had a gun, big fucking whoop.</p><p>“Pretty toy you got there, big guy. Too bad your need to overcompensate resulted in poaching.” Rio held up her own hand, two fingers extended with her thumb sticking up. She closed one eye as if she were aiming her finger gun, flicking her wrist as she mocked, “<i>Pew.</i>”</p><p>“It’s <i>pearl.</i>” She stated, holding up the gun for proof. Oh, okay, that was <i>surprisingly</i> very ethical of a possible mob boss. The woman rolled her eyes, quickly snatching Rio’s bag and dumping out the contents on her desk. A bunch of poker chips, wallets, keys, cigarettes, lighter, lipstick, sunglasses, dagger, mace, a few tampons, some loose change, and the godforsaken dinner rolls. She snickered as she tucked her gun away. “Woah, quite the fucking loot.”</p><p>“Hey!” Rio rushed over, the other woman lightly pushing her back.</p><p>Her eyes flicked back and forth between Rio and the shit sprawled atop the table. “Klepto.”</p><p>“I paid for the rolls!”</p><p>“You wanna tell me your name now, or would you rather wait til’ the police get here?”</p><p>Fuck, Rio could not get arrested, she had nobody to pay her bail and her plants would die a sweltering death in her home which would be towed off into an abandoned lot god knows where. Plus, if there was record of her arrest, it could make her easy to find, even easier to kill. “You don’t strike me as the type to like cops.”</p><p>“I don’t, but it’s different when they work for me.”</p><p>She groaned, accepting she’d brought a literal knife to this gunfight. “Fine. It’s Rio.”</p><p>The woman snort-laughed in an oddly endearing manner. “You a big <i>Duran Duran</i> fan?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Duran Duran.”</p><p>“Uh huh…”</p><p>“Her name is Rio and she dances in the sand,” she sing-songed, pausing a beat for recognition from Rio. “Like the song.”</p><p>Rio furrowed her brows. “It’s short for Rosario.”</p><p>“Pretty,” she murmured. “Still doesn’t change the fact that you stole from me. So, I’m gonna have to call the cops and if you try to bolt before they get here, I’ll shoot you.”</p><p>Rio was momentarily stunned by the bluntness with which the woman had delivered the news. “At least offer to buy a gal a drink first…?”</p><p>She rounded the desk, flopping into the chair and picking up the phone. “I’ve apparently been buying you a lotta things over the course of however fucking long.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio rested her palms on the desk, leaning over to look down at this woman who was confusing her in more ways than one. “<i>Please</i> do not call the police, please. I’ll never come back again, just let me leave.”</p><p>“Where’s the fun in that?” She punched in the first number.</p><p>Rio’s resolve and chill was cracking as she bent down and found the phone cord and <i>yanked</i> it out the wall, forcing the line to go dead. “Are you a dick for a reason or just the love of the game?!”</p><p>She tossed the phone back into the cradle, swaying back in her chair. “Little of both.”</p><p>Rio stood up, letting out a deep breath. “What if I- what if I paid whatever I owe you?”</p><p>She cackled, loud and unabashed in her judgment. “Sweetheart, you barely have two pennies to rub together.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes fell to the pitiful pile of her stuff on the desk. “I can work it off.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Blue eyes lingered over her body as she smirked. “Doing what?”</p><p>The remark hung in the air with Rio immediately shutting down that fantasy. “I’m not letting you pimp me out!”</p><p>The woman’s face twisted like someone had just smacked her. “Hey now, I may be <i>a lot</i> of things, but do I really look like a pimp?” She pinched the collar of her button up in reference as she exclaimed, “This is <i>Armani!</i>”</p><p>“That a trick question?” Rio deadpanned, motioning around the room and then pointing to the woman’s general appearance and demeanor. “Yes!”</p><p>“One, when it’s a woman, the proper term is ‘madam.’ Two, I’ve done a lotta shady shit, but forcing women into sexually violent and unsafe situations isn’t really my schtick.”</p><p>“Then, what is?” Rio threw her arms up. “Huh?”</p><p>She sighed, pursing her lips. “I suppose labor exploitation isn’t a terrible way to cut costs.”</p><p>“What are you gonna make me do?” Rio nearly whined, her brain conjuring the worst images possible. “Do I have to kill a guy? Dismember a body? Do you do the thing where you put the dead people in acid?”</p><p>“Um, I was gonna give you pick of showgirl or cocktail waitress…”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio relaxed. “Cocktail waitress, then, I guess.”</p><p>“Shame,” she muttered. “Bet you would've looked good in the rhinestone bra and matching thong.”</p><p>Rio didn’t doubt she’d look good, but when it involved being on stage for a bunch of men to holler at, the allure quickly faded. “So we have a deal?”</p><p>The woman rolled her eyes again, slumping in her seat. “Fine, whatever.”</p><p>“Does that mean I get your name?” Rio sauntered over, sitting on the edge of the desk. “Or will you have to kill me if you tell me?” She dramatically widened her eyes. “Since you’re so scary and dangerous.”</p><p>She began plucking the chips off the desk. “I’ll be confiscating these-”</p><p>Rio lurched forward, slapping her hands over the woman's. “No.”</p><p>The owner looked up, baring her teeth as a warning. “I suggest you consider your next move very, <i>very</i> carefully.”</p><p>Rio let go, holding up her arms in surrender. “Just, let me keep what I got tonight. I’m about to be homeless otherwise, and you can’t exploit me if I’m dead from the heatstroke of living on the side of the road in Vegas in June.”</p><p>“Don't be so cynical,” she tutted. “A coyote would probably maul you before then.”</p><p>“Coyotes rarely attack humans,” Rio corrected absentmindedly. “They’re naturally timid and afraid of people. Actually, I’d have a higher chance of getting taken out by a snake or scorpion.”</p><p>She blinked, scowling as she responded, “Gee, thanks for that tantalizing tidbit about Nevada wildlife.”</p><p>“Either way, I’m of no use to you if I’m a goner.”</p><p>The chips were thoughtlessly flung onto the desk again. “Fine, it’s only, like, $300. What do I care, I’ll add it to your tab.”</p><p>Rio picked up everything in fistfuls and threw it back into her bag. “Is there really a tab?”</p><p>“No,” she grinned. “I’ll just work you until I get bored.”</p><p>“Great,” Rio hissed, rising to her feet. “Well, this has been a super duper fun time, but I should probably get the hell outta here before you get trigger happy.”</p><p>“I’ll see you tomorrow, come in around noon and we’ll train you.” She then added, “And just as a heads up, you get more tips if you wear something low cut.”</p><p>“Turtleneck, got it. Thanks.” Rio marched across the room, pausing at the door. “Wait, what <i>the fuck</i> is your name?”</p><p>She leaned forward on her forearms, staring at Rio through her brows. “It’s <i>Agatha.</i>”</p><p>“Agatha,” she echoed. “Suits you.”</p><p>“Get the fuck out, Rosario.” Agatha waved a dismissive hand as she put on a pair of glasses and pulled out a leather folder. “Before I change my mind.”</p><p>She didn’t need to be told twice, leaving the casino after cashing out. Her legs worked overtime as they carried her home, storming into the trailer park and banging on Tony’s door. It creaked open, the man appearing in the doorway naked in an untied robe, what looked to be coke still coating his nostrils.</p><p>“Jesus fuck, put your penis away.” She swallowed a gag, shoving the money to his chest. “See you next month.”</p><p>As she turned on her heel, she heard him shout, “You wanna come in?”</p><p>“No, Tony!”</p><p>“I got party favors!”</p><p>Rio glared over her shoulder. “Yeah, I know! It’s why our sewage line backs up four times a month! Never have the money to fix it ‘cause of your <i>fucking</i> party favors!”</p><p>“More for me,” he muttered, closing the door to his trailer.</p><p>Once back at her own home, Rio grabbed the mail before walking in and locking the door behind her. The night always cooled the place some, but still not enough to be considered comfortable. She kicked off her heels and undid her garter as she waltzed into the kitchenette and fell into the nearest chair at the dining table. Rio sorted through the various envelopes, all bills, all stamped with bright red <i>OVERDUE.</i></p><p>After briefly getting up to snag a bottle of whatever liquor she still had, Rio sorted the bills while taking a shot every time she was told her water or power was about to be shut off. So to recap, she was indebted to a madwoman who seemed to run an organized crime ring and she couldn’t make any actual money elsewhere unless she had the night off. Even with the extra $100 left over, and the $92 from the wallets, she was still smited by whatever cruel god had dealt her life’s hand. There were credit cards, but didn’t feel like risking credit card fraud and ending up in prison before thirty. Fuck, she was dead in the water. Rio found her bag, grabbing a dinner roll and stuffing it into her mouth as she unzipped her skirt, letting the fabric hit the ground.</p><p>Her body collapsed on the bed, eating the semi-stale bread and staring at the ceiling. She could sell her blood…or a kidney. Ah, but even using her body for spare parts probably wouldn’t cover the backlog of bills and student debt she had on her back. Maybe she could just skip town…but she didn’t own a fucking car. And Agatha seemed like the type to be a very special breed of scorned woman, the type that actually kept her word about collecting a bounty. That woman needed psychological help, that deranged and manic, kinda hot woman.</p><p><i>“Gooooood evening, Las Vegans!”</i>” The clock radio still limp on the floor announced. <i>“Or should I say morning? After all, it is 2AM, but that’s early in the night for the real degenerates. The sunset has dropped the temps down to a chilling 77 degrees, so enjoy it while you can! And just in case you need some encouragement, here’s Joan Jett’s Crimson&amp;Clover-”</i></p><p>The lights cut out unceremoniously, the clock going silent as the outlet it was plugged into no longer produced electricity. The wheezing of the AC stopped, as did the humming of the fridge.</p><p>That checked out.</p><p>Was it wrong that she had a mild curiosity as to what ‘shady shit’ Agatha was doing, or that she was still replaying Agatha’s fingers lingering on her thigh? It was probably wrong, yeah. But then again, who was she to judge. Everyone was just trying to survive, or in Agatha’s case– thrive. Rio lied, stole, and cheated on a daily basis. She really didn’t have a leg to stand on, or if the state of Nevada had anything to say about it soon, a pot to piss in. It was fine, she’d do her job and if it didn’t make ends meet, she’d run another job elsewhere. There was always hustling guys at sports bars if she really got desperate.</p><p>Oh, fuck this fucking city.</p>

<p>Since Rio valued her life to some degree, she showed up to the casino at noon on the dot. After waking up in a puddle of her own sweat that morning, and taking a freezing cold shower, she was just happy to be somewhere with electricity. Her water would go next, she was sure of it, but that was a problem for later. Right now, she had to focus on learning how to balance a tray of drinks lest she be whacked or imprisoned. The Belladonna looked weird in the daylight, a ghost town with a few straggling drunks at the slot machines. Nothing more jarring than Vegas in the cold light of day, the night definitely made the city look semi-presentable.</p><p>She was barely through the door when a redheaded woman launched herself in Rio’s way. Her hair was big, her smile kind, and her eyes a very pretty shade of green. The ginger was wearing a longsleeved white button up  with a black vest like Alice’s, only this one wasn’t satin, it was covered in sequins and glitter. “Rosario, right?”</p><p>“It’s just Rio,” she cautiously replied.</p><p>“I’m Wanda.” She offered out her hand. “Agatha told me we had a new girl starting today.”</p><p>Rio shook her hand, trying to smile. “That’s me, I guess.”</p><p>“You really made an impression on her, huh?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I’ve known Agatha for years, and she has <i>never</i> not shot or arrested someone for stealing from her,” Wanda cheerily explained. “She must like you.”</p><p>“I don’t know about that,” Rio deadpanned. “She did threaten me with her gun.”</p><p>Wanda waved her off. “Oh, she does that with everyone.” She looped her arm around Rio’s and began walking. “So, have you ever waitressed before?”</p><p>“Um, yeah. Back home I waited tables through college.”</p><p>“Oh, where are you from?”</p><p>Fuck, she should’ve kept her answer short. “Uh, ya know, down south.”</p><p>“What state?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat. “Where is Agatha?”</p><p>“Hell if I know.” Wanda shrugged. “Keeping track of her daily dealings is an impossible task.”</p><p>“Dealings?”</p><p>The redhead let go of her as they entered a room marked <i>employees only</i>, pointing to the lockers. “You can put your bag in a free locker, I’ll grab your vest and nametag. Technically, the dress code states that you have to wear black pants and a white shirt under the vest…” Wanda’s gaze roamed over Rio's current outfit of black denim shorts and a white <i>Blondie</i> band tee. “But, you’re probably fine for today.”</p><p>She whipped her bag into a locker, taking the vest and nametag with <i>Rosario</i> etched into the metal. “It’s <i>just</i> Rio.”</p><p>“Agatha said Rosario so that’s what they printed.” Wanda turned on her heel, leaving Rio to keep up as they went out onto the casino floor. “Since you’re familiar with the job, I won’t drone on too much but-”</p><p>Rio zoned out, Wanda was nice but she didn’t really care to learn the specifics of what this job entailed. Honestly, she was more interested in the whereabouts of the mean lady who had trapped Rio here in the first place. And as the hours ticked by, she was becoming increasingly frustrated both by the lack of Agatha’s presence, and the abundance of Wanda’s. There were too many personal questions that she had to deflect. Her age, her schooling, her family or romantic partners, her past as a whole. She felt like she was being interrogated. The gig did come with a free employee meal on her lunch break though, and she wasn’t in the position to turn down free food.</p><p>Around eight, Wanda pulled her aside, her voice low in warning. “As patrons file in, be aware of your surroundings. There’s a reason why we don’t wear the old uniforms anymore.”</p><p>“Old uniforms?”</p><p>“They had skirts and we couldn’t keep dealing with the assaults."</p><p>“Oh my god?!” Rio blanched in horror.</p><p>Wanda’s eyes widened at her mistake. “Oh, no, not like that. Well, yes, like that. But I meant that we couldn’t keep solving the issue of men being perverts by Agatha pistol whipping them.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, setting her tray down at the bar. “She was seriously pistol whipping dudes?”</p><p>“She doesn’t need much encouragement to begin with…” Wanda muttered. “Just keep an eye out for wandering hands, they’ll probably see how far you’ll let them go because you’re new.”</p><p>“If anyone touches me, I’ll break a beer bottle and use it as a makeshift shiv.”</p><p>“Do whatever you gotta do.” Wanda shimmied off her vest. “You’re on your own, but if you need anything-” She pointed to Alice on the other side of the bar. “I believe you two are already acquainted.”</p><p>“Wait, where are you going?”</p><p>“I’m the floor manager, my waitressing days are <i>way</i> behind me.”</p><p>“Why the fuck were you training me, then? Couldn’t another waitress have done it?” Rio cocked her head, scanning the room of at least five other cocktail waitresses.</p><p>“Agatha asked me for the favor,” Wanda sighed. “So I did it. But, you’re competent and have common sense, which is rare in the service industry nowadays. Congratulations, you’re trained. Except…” She snapped a scrunchie off her wrist. “It’s not required, but trust me, you’ll want your hair up within the first ten minutes of peak.”</p><p>Rio took it, pulling her hair up. “How fucking long is peak?”</p><p>“Um, just like 8PM to 2AM.”</p><p>“2AM?!” Rio gawked. “How long is my shift?”</p><p>“I didn’t get those details, so whenever Agatha tells you to leave.”</p><p>“That’s not legal!”</p><p>“Neither is scamming casinos or pickpocketing people, but hey, what do I know?” Wanda smiled, giving her a wave and walking off. “Have fun!”</p><p>Rio looked at Alice, leaning over the bar. “How long is <i>your</i> shift?”</p><p>“However long it takes me to make the amount of money I want,” Alice spoke as she set up the garnishes. “My main job here isn’t bartending, if you catch my drift…”</p><p>“No, I don’t.”</p><p>“A handful of us work for Agatha in other ways, but work for the casino on paper in case any suits go digging.” She said, idly doing the work of a barback instead of a bartender.</p><p>“Suits?” Rio echoed. “Like, feds?”</p><p>Alice held up a finger to her own lips. “I didn’t say that.”</p><p>“Okay,” She hissed. “Fuck this, I’m finding Agatha.”</p><p>Alice snickered to herself. “You do that.”</p><p>She stormed off the main floor, following the same path Agatha had taken her last night through one of the back halls. Rio stopped at the same office door, hearing a moan of, “<i>Jen.</i>”</p><p>“Just a little longer.” A woman's voice soothed.</p><p>Rio knocked out caution since it sounded like she did not want to walk in on whatever was happening on the other side of the door. There was a grunt, followed by, “Come in.”</p><p>She opened the door, greeted by Agatha on the other side. Only it was not in the way she was expecting. The older woman was sitting atop her desk, jaw clenched in pain as another woman applied gauze to Agatha’s bloodied abdomen. There were freckles splattered over her stomach, along with some faded scars and fresh bruises, but what caught Rio’s attention was the faint strip of hair that started at her belly button and disappeared at the waist of her pants. Aside from the fact that it looked like a crime scene, Agatha was only left in slacks and a beater tank that had been shucked up to sit just below her tits. No bra of course, not that Rio found that as much of a surprise.</p><p>Her mouth opened but nothing came out. Her mouth that now felt inexplicably dry as her sights lingered on the creamy skin of Agatha’s stomach, the swell of her ribs, the outline of her nipples in the practically sheer top. Good fucking god, Rio could make out the barbell piercings on what looked to be the most perfect pair of tits Rio had possibly ever seen.</p><p>Not the point, but a delicious mental image for later.

</p><p>Agatha cocked her head in annoyance. “If you’re going to stare, at least close the door.”</p><p>“Oh, s-sorry.” Rio shut the door behind her, but kept her eyes locked on Agatha.</p><p>“Did you need something?” Her boss questioned, hissing as Jen applied sterile dressing after the alcohol. “Or are you the voyeur now?”</p><p>Rio answered neither questions. “What happened?”</p><p>Agatha sniffled in disinterest. “Guy didn’t pay, I told him to pay, he pulled a knife on me. End of story.”</p><p>“A customer in the casino stabbed you?!”</p><p>The woman patching Agatha up, Jen, chuckled. She was probably around Agatha’s age with mid-length curly hair that she had in a half-up half-down do, dressed similarly to Wanda, but her vest was a rich purple. “He definitely wasn’t in the casino, nor a customer. And he didn’t stab her, it’s a slice at best. She’s just being a baby about it.” She stood up, holding the gauze against Agatha’s skin and pointing to the roll of medical tape on the couch. “Grab that for me.”</p><p>Rio did so, handing it off. “You should go to the hospital.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha sweetly smiled, too polite and too kind. “I didn’t even <i>think</i> of that.”</p><p>At her feet, Rio found Agatha’s button up, a light blue now drenched in deep crimson. “You’ve probably lost too much blood.”</p><p>Agatha peered over at the shirt. “Oh, don’t worry. Most of that isn’t even mine.”</p><p>Her face scrunched while she processed that sentence. “Okay, um, what the fuck is it that you <i>do?!</i>”</p><p>Jen finished, snapping off the latex gloves and ignoring Rio. “I bet it was a coke rage this time.”</p><p>“Just ‘cause I do a <i>little</i> blow for some pep in my step, does not mean this was a coke rage.” Agatha scoffed. “He didn’t pay Teen, and since Teen has all the muscle of wet spaghetti, that left the lovely task to fall to me.”</p><p>“Oh, you’re so stupid,” Jen muttered.</p><p>“You’re cute,” Agatha frowned.</p><p>Jen pressed on the wound, rolling her eyes. “Shove it, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha winced in pain, but still quipped, “Press harder next time, hon. I was close.”</p><p>“I gotta get back to the floor before peak starts.” Jen threw everything in the garbage, grabbing Agatha's blood-soaked shirt off the ground. “I’ll see if housekeeping can salvage this.”</p><p>“Tell ‘em whoever gets the blood out gets an extra vacation day,” Agatha muttered, hopping off the desk and tugging her tank top down. “Or a bottle of Dom.”</p><p>“Got it,” Jen chirped, leaving like what had just happened here was an average occurrence.</p><p>“Now,” Agatha groaned, eyeing Rio. “What's up?”</p><p>“I, uh.” She rapidly blinked in shock. “I- um, are you okay?”</p><p>“Swell.” Agatha winked. “Did you just want a peep show or are you in here for a purpose?”</p><p>“You never told Wanda when my shift ends…which kind of feels like a silly thing to ask about after you’ve been gutted like a fish.”</p><p>“I <i>wasn’t</i> gutted,” She snarled. “But your concern is sweet, baby.”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against her cheek, ignoring the pet name. “So, my shift?”</p><p>Agatha leaned over her desk, a strangled noise of pain exiting her mouth as she grabbed a pack of cigarettes. “Smoke break?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>She held up the pack and fished a lighter out of her pocket. “C’mon, I need a fucking cigarette after that.”</p><p>Rio aimlessly followed as Agatha sauntered down the hall to a service entrance, stopping at an old crate just outside the door and sitting down. The older woman lit her own cigarette, patting the empty spot next to her. Well, Rio had run out of cigarettes this morning, so she wasn’t going to deny free nicotine. She took her spot next to Agatha, who immediately <i>shoved</i> a cig between Rio’s lips and cupped her hand around the end while lighting it. The first inhale was a godsend, even with how fucking strange everyone here was, at least the buzz hit her brain.</p><p>“So, Rosario-”</p><p>“<i>Just</i> Rio, for fuck’s sake,” she snapped, pinching the bridge of her nose in frustration.</p><p>Agatha seemed taken aback, but kept pressing anyway. “Long day, sourpuss?”</p><p>Rio took a drag before answering, “I don’t go by my full name.”</p><p>“Is that a point of contention for you, or are you just naturally agitated?” Agatha giggled. “Or is there a story there?”</p><p>Yes.</p><p>“No,” Rio ground out.</p><p>She squinted at Rio like she was trying to read a book in a foreign language she’d never seen before. “There’s <i>definitely</i> a story there.” She blew out some smoke, pointing an accusatory finger. “A skeleton in your closet?”</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Rio plastered a bitter smile on her face. “What about you?”</p><p>“Moi?” Agatha asked, her tone dripping with false innocence. “What about me?”</p><p>“Your skeletons. You’ve got a whole-” Rio motioned around with her hands. “<i>Operation</i> here.”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s what a casino is-”</p><p>“No, no.” She hoisted herself up, pacing and smoking. “Because you’ve been too fucking nonchalant about criminal dealings. Your…<i>people</i>, or who the fuck ever, are too casual. There’s <i>clearly</i> an operation running out of this place and-”</p><p>“Have you <i>witnessed</i> a crime, Rio?”</p><p>Rio stopped pacing. “Well…no.”</p><p>“Then it sounds like you’re making things up.” Agatha flicked her cigarette butt to the ground, rising to her feet. “What do you think is happening here?”</p><p>Rio was going to fucking scream. “I don’t know! Some type of murder club? Racketeering?” She didn’t actually <i>know</i> what racketeering was, but all the major mob bosses were arrested for it. “And you’re in charge of it all.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, deep and throaty, and Rio tried hard not to focus on how much she liked that sound. “<i>I’m</i> in charge?!” The other woman broke down into hysterics. “Aw no, baby, you’ve got it all wrong.” Agatha stalked towards her, slowly and without a care in the world. “I’m just as much a pawn as anyone else here. Fuck, I’m not even the kingpin.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted, her eyes tracking every detail on Agatha’s features for an inkling of lying. There wasn’t any. “So who the hell is?”</p><p>She shrugged like a little kid who just got away with something. “Someone much, <i>much</i> scarier.”</p><p>Rio stomped out her cigarette. “Do you ever say what you actually mean or is it all just tongue and cheek with you?”</p><p>She raised her brows, coyly responding, “Are you interested in my tongue?”</p><p>And, damn it all to hell, Rio actually felt herself blush momentarily. “I’m interested in what caused a guy to treat you like a Christmas ham.”</p><p>“Money, drugs.” Agatha leaned into her space just fractionally. “It’s kinda my thing.”</p><p>“You’re a drug dealer, then?”</p><p>“Mmmh.” She scrunched her nose in dissatisfaction, as if she were unhappy with the job title Rio had provided. “‘Trafficker’ is probably more accurate, but that’s just a small piece of the pie.”</p><p>“And Wanda? Jen? Alice?”</p><p>“Everyone wants a slice,” Agatha purred. “It’s very lucrative, so long as the numbers shake out.”</p><p>“What’s the bigger piece?”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips in consideration. “I’ve already said too much, and I really don’t need the feds on my ass…<i>again.</i>”</p><p>“You think <i>I’m</i> a fed?” Rio chuckled. “I doubt I’d make the cut at the hiring fair.”</p><p>“Yes!” Agatha snapped her fingers, pointing frantically. “I agree, but you’re clearly smart, if not educated. You’re not local because if you were, I would’ve seen you sooner. So, why wouldn’t they, Rio? For all intents and purposes, you’re capable of doing something else.” She smiled like an evil mastermind fitting the pieces of the puzzle together. “So why are you <i>here?</i> Why is a smart, pretty girl like you surviving off deception?”</p><p>Rio stumbled back, twisting and scrunching her face to match how her insides felt. “Why do you care?”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders slumped. “I get bored, and you’re nearly as guarded as me. I wanna see what’s underneath.”</p><p>She swallowed back the truth, opting to deflect. “Is my shift over?”</p><p>Agatha clicked her tongue against her teeth, stuffing her hands in her pockets in a show of defeat. “Yeah.”</p><p>“Great.” Rio brushed past her towards the door, halting when Agatha spoke again.</p><p>“You want a ride home?”</p><p>She turned around, knitting her brows together. “Why?”</p><p>“I figured you walked here. It’s Friday night, the streets will have a bunch of creeps out.” Agatha opened the door. “And I got the time.”</p><p>“Are you high?” Rio tutted. “Or secretly going to drive me out to the desert to shoot me and discard my body?”</p><p>“I’d <i>never</i> discard your body, hon,” Agatha tsk’d, ushering her inside. “I’m also not high, though I should fix that soon.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes as she walked back to the employee room, snatching her bag out of her locker and replacing it with her vest and nametag. Agatha was already waiting outside the door, but must’ve stopped at her office for her suit jacket to cover her bloodied tank top. Her boss held up her keys, smirking as she said, “Ready?”</p><p>“As ready as I’ll ever be,” Rio muttered, trailing after the older woman through the casino, which was <i>packed</i> to the brim. “Oh, peak.”</p><p>“Yup,” Agatha affirmed. “And you’re working it tomorrow.”</p><p>“<i>Fuck.</i>”</p><p>They reached the parking lot, Agatha making a beeline for an old blue convertible. Well, not old, but most likely vintage and outrageously expensive. Agatha opened the passenger side for Rio, holding it open and carelessly slamming it shut once she was in. Rio peeked around, finding no obvious signs of a dead body. “What’d you do with that guy?”</p><p>“What guy?” Agatha started the car, the engine purring to life in a spectacularly macho fashion.</p><p>“The guy you presumably killed.”</p><p>“He’s in the trunk,” Agatha flatly stated.</p><p>Rio whipped around, as if she could see through the car’s frame into the trunk. “Really?”</p><p>Agatha blinked a couple times, before cackling. “No! You think I drive around with cadavers?”</p><p>“So I’m not wrong to assume there’s cadavers somewhere? Or that you killed that guy?”</p><p>“I’m sure there’s cadavers somewhere in the state of Nevada.”</p><p>She sighed as she slumped in her seat, too fucking tired to entertain any more of Agatha’s quips. “There’s about to be one more very soon if you don’t take me home.”</p><p>“I need an address, doll,” Agatha rasped.</p><p>Rio clenched her jaw, because this woman was <i>maddening.</i> But Rio also crossed her legs because the woman was <i>maddening</i> in a whole other way. “I live in the trailer park off the north end.”</p><p>“Wait.” Agatha pressed her lips together, suppressing a giggle. “Like, Stark Park?”</p><p>“That would be the one.”</p><p>“You live in one of the shittiest parts of town and yet you’re working for free?”</p><p>Rio cocked her head. “I didn’t have much of a choice, now did I?”</p><p>She threw the car into reverse. “Damn, prison might’ve been a better living situation than fucking Stark Park.”</p><p>“Just go!”</p><p>“And there’s the agitation,” Agatha murmured, blasting the radio as she pulled out into the street.<br/>
</p><p>Rio almost forgot how quickly cars could take a person from point A to point B, because it’s only one <i>Quiet Riot</i> song, and half a <i>Heart</i> anthem before Agatha was turning into the park. Rio only let her pull up halfway through the dirt road before she unbuckled her seatbelt. “Here’s fine.”</p><p>Agatha lazily shifted the gear into park, turning her body to face her. “Which one is yours?”</p><p>Rio’s was the sun bleached tin can that she bought off someone three years ago with the last of the money she had left. Rio’s was the one with duct tape holding together a broken window pane. Rio’s was the one with a half-alive garden. Her’s was the one right next to Lilia, who did $5 tarot card and palm readings to make ends meet. Meaning there was a small neon sign that reflected off Rio’s front door all night, <i>that</i> was Rio’s humble abode.</p><p>She smiled at Agatha, keeping her voice light as she said, “Thanks for the ride.” Rio got out of the car, crossing her arms in wait as Agatha pulled off.</p><p>The older woman shot her a second wink of the night as she went back the way she came, humming along to <i>The Grass Roots</i> as she made a lefthand turn out of the park, disappearing just a second later. She slinked back to her place, fumbling with her keys as she counted down the seconds until she could take off the boots that were not suitable for wearing all day. There was the crunch of gravel behind her, Lilia’s voice carrying out, “Who just dropped you off?”</p><p>And, sue her, Rio had a soft spot for the old lady. She always brought Rio food when she could, and was a better cheat than her at cards. “My boss.”</p><p>Lilia practically flung herself towards Rio, grabbing her wrist. “No, absolutely not.” Her voice was low, it was steady. “You cannot be around Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>Rio grinned, writing it off as one of Lilia’s many quirks. “Yeah, why is that?”</p><p>“She has a <i>reputation,</i>” Lilia cautioned. “I’ve lived here my whole life, and one thing we learned early on? You don’t concern yourself with the Harkness family. She is ruthless, Rio.”</p><p>“The woman who was singing along to Heart in the car?”</p><p>“You know she killed her own father?” Her neighbor’s eyes went wide. “She was ten, found his gun, shot him in the back of the head. They couldn’t lock her up ‘cause she was too young.”</p><p>“Lilia, I doubt-”</p><p>“Her son, too.”</p><p>“Her what?”</p><p>“She was pregnant, then she wasn’t.” Lilia conspiratorially whispered. “Nobody ever saw the kid, but there were rumors.”</p><p>And even if she hadn’t known Agatha longer than forty-eight hours, Rio had a hard time believing that. Agatha didn’t scream ‘sociopathic serial killer’ to her, if anything, it seemed like Agatha just viewed murder through a lens of  apathy, or as a means to an end.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio murmured, trying to calm Lilia down. “When exactly was this?”</p><p>“Ah,” she breathed out. “At least a few decades ago. I can’t be sure, they all blend and blur together at a certain point. But, I am serious. She is the way she is for a <i>reason.</i>”</p><p>“You think she’d still be free and walking around if she had killed her own child? They’re rumors for a reason, Lil.”</p><p>“She’s not in jail because she pays off the cops!” Lilia threw her arms up. “You’re in danger with her, you need to realize that before you’re in too deep.”</p><p>“Nothing is gonna happen,” Rio soothed. “I’m a cocktail waitress, hardly seems like the kind of job where I’d get wrapped up in something.”</p><p>“For your sake, I hope so.”</p><hr/><p>Agatha arrived back at the casino, walking down the alleyway to the service entrance, a tiny grin playing at her lips. There was something there, something more to Rio. She didn’t yet know what it was, but it fascinated her regardless. She was only ripped from her thoughts when she registered someone sitting on the smoking crate, well, smoking.</p><p>“Shouldn’t you be running the floor?” Agatha raised a brow at Wanda furiously huffing on a cigarette.</p><p>“I’ve been here nine hours, leave me alone,” Wanda groaned. “I wanted to tuck Tommy in tonight.”</p><p>“He has a father for that, no?” Agatha leaned on the crate, stealing one of Wanda’s cigs because her own pack was still in the office.</p><p>“Eh, Sharon will probably end up doing it.” The redhead’s eyes grew wet. “I rely on my neighbor more than my own husband.”</p><p>“Say the word and I’ll take care of it.” She narrowed her gaze. “Speaking of, how is that sack of shit?”</p><p>“He’s…maintaining,” Wanda quietly said. “He doesn’t mean it.”</p><p>“And by that you mean…?”</p><p>“He hasn’t started in on Tommy.”</p><p>“Speaking from experience, kids know, you know,” Agatha gently prodded. “They always know. And there will come a day where Tommy’s old enough to fight back on your behalf, and he will.”</p><p>“You worry too much.”</p><p>“It’s not out of worry for you,” Agatha dismissed. “I was the one who paid your last hospital bill, I’m concerned for my wallet.”</p><p>Wanda smiled, the stiff one she always did when she was exhausted. “Nobody asked you to do that.”</p><p>“Well, I need your body functional.” Is what Agatha settled for instead of, <i>“Well, your husband threw you down the fucking stairs and no insurance company I provide to my staff covers two broken ribs.”</i></p><p>“Yeah, and I’m sure that's why you paid for Jen’s car to get fixed.”</p><p>Agatha raised her chin in defiance. “She wouldn’t let me fix it myself, and that shop did an okay job.”</p><p>Wanda ashed her cigarette as she retorted, “And what about that new young piece you’ve got running around here?”</p><p>“Who might that be?” Agatha scoffed, pinching the cigarette between her fingers like it owed her money.</p><p>Wanda dropped her voice, making it raspy and wanton. “Rosario.”</p><p>“You forgot to add ‘hot’ to her title,” she quipped. “But I’m pretty sure she’s out of here the second I quit blackmailing her.”</p><p>“Really? ‘Cause she asked about you.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lower lip, swatting Wanda’s shoulder. “Did she?”</p><p>“She’s curious, I’ll give you that.” She threw her cig at the ground. “Intelligent too, that’s a fun change in pattern for you.”</p><p>“Hey, I bagged Jen at one point.”</p><p>“Jen was an outlier.” Wanda jumped off the crate. “And you didn’t bag Jen, Jen bagged you.” Wanda’s eyes brightened as she teased, “You can deny it all you want, but you like a challenge. And if Rio wants nothing to do with you, you’re gonna get all pouty about it.”</p><p>“This is why bosses shouldn’t be friends with their employees,” Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>“I should get back to the floor, make sure nobody’s dying.”</p><p>“Still on for Sunday?”</p><p>Wanda nodded. “Like clockwork, how much are we skimming?”</p><p>“As much as it takes to keep my mother off my fucking back.”</p><p>She paused at the door, saying, “Also, Jen told me to tell you that housekeeping couldn’t save your shirt.”</p><p>“Shit, that was imported silk,” she grimaced around her cigarette. “They burn it?”</p><p>“They know the protocol.” Wanda waved off, leaving a moment later.</p><p>Fucking asshole had stiffed her <i>and</i> ruined one her favorite shirts. Yeah, he had it coming.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Las Vegas was originally a rail line stop between L.A. and Salt Lake City, a meaningless speck of dust in the desert. It was established in 1903 as a blue collar town that held nothing more than beds for railroad workers, quiet and all-American. Then the Hoover Dam began construction and gambling was legalized, and those workers spent every two weeks gambling and drinking. Prohibition ended, and booze made gambling even easier to sell as a viable pastime. The previous hole in the market for alcohol also meant drugs were thrown into the cocktail of debauchery, along with—of course—prostitution. All this to say, Agatha wasn’t reinventing the wheel. Vegas had been developed as a mecca for addicts and criminals, it wasn’t her fault if people overindulged to the point of death or poverty.</p><p>She wasn’t particularly fond of the life she lived, but she survived, she always did. Agatha took the respite where she could, when she could. Evanora got her damn money, and Agatha got to stay alive. There was always that shadow lurking behind her back, however. Always something more, always demanding, always taking. So, Agatha complied, becoming desensitized to her day to day. Because surviving was all that mattered, her own self-preservation. But, that didn’t disqualify her from partaking in what the city had to offer. Substances and sex were great pacifiers for inner turmoil, an endless myriad of distractions at her fingertips at any given moment.</p><p>Her eyelids creaked open to the warm beams of light leaking in through the blinds, the sheets tangled around her naked body. Agatha quickly peeked over at the body next to her—long brunette waves, lithe frame, and if she recalled correctly—brown eyes. Couldn’t be sure now, as her one night stand was dead asleep. Agatha rolled out of bed, finding her robe and tying it closed before shaking the woman whose name she couldn’t remember.</p><p>“Hey,” she rasped, her brain muddled in sleep and last night’s concoction of…she was guessing vodka and coke? “It’s time for you to get going-” Sarah? Shannon?...Holly? “Hon.”</p><p>The woman groaned but went about collecting her clothing and was out the door five minutes later. She gave Agatha her phone number, saying she’d hope they’d run into each other again. Agatha grinned and kissed her goodbye, shutting the door and tossing the phone number in the trash on her way to the bathroom. Shannon was a nice girl, pretty, and slightly vapid. And while she may have resembled Rio—she wasn’t. Agatha didn’t like that Sarah was nice, or compliant. Agatha didn’t like that Holly didn’t call her out on her bullshit, actually that woman might’ve not noticed any of Agatha’s posturing. What a shame.</p><p>And though Agatha might not have many morals, corrupting a young woman purely out of a desire to fuck her into the matress did seem just a smidge too far. Sure, Agatha would play with Rio, bat her around like a cat does with a mouse, but for the past <i>month</i> Rio had been working at the casino, that was all Agatha did. She teased and she goaded, she distracted Rio from work, but that was where things ended. Agatha was generous enough to let Rio keep her tips, it was chump change to her and Rio certainly needed it more than her.</p><p>“Hello, my babies,” Agatha cooed as she got dressed, both dogs running into the bedroom. She crouched down, petting under Scratchy’s chin while Vic nudged her head against Agatha’s shoulder. “I know, I’m sorry,” she simpered. “I had a guest.”</p><p>The hotel staff would have their work cut out for them, the bedroom looked like a nuke had gone off. A lamp shattered on the floor, a few bottles of liquor, the bedding seemingly torn up. A perk to living in the penthouse suite on the top floor of the resort, Agatha never had to worry about coming back to a dirty home. Teen often took Vic and Scratchy for their walks or to the groomers when Agatha was out, having two dobermans required much more time than she had to give. But, they were great company nonetheless, and she wasn’t going to leave them in the situation she’d once found them in.</p><p>After fastening her belt and Rolex, Agatha made her way down to the first floor. It was early evening and all the guests looked dazed and docile. Casinos were meant to lure someone in and keep them trapped, it’s why there were no clocks anywhere, yet mirrors on most walls. Disoriented customers are long lasting customers, and the patrons reduced to money bags loved it. Seriously, about eight years ago the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino caught on fire, and there were <i>still</i> people refusing to leave their games. Firefighters literally had to herd them out like cattle to pull them away from the poker tables before the slot machines went up in flames. The relationship between gamblers and the game was clearly copacetic.</p><p>“Your mother has called five times in three hours,” Jen said, accosting Agatha as soon as she set foot out of the elevator. “I called up to your room several thousand times to try and tell you.”</p><p>“Good morning to you, too,” Agatha muttered, striding past her employee.</p><p>“It’s nighttime,” she deadpanned, sidling up next to her and falling into step. “You’re a grown woman sleeping past noon every day, you realize how ridiculous that is, right?”</p><p>“You wound me.” Agatha clutched her chest in offense, offering a small pout. “Here I thought the degradation ended with our relationship.” Calling what Jen and Agatha once had a ‘relationship’ was a pretty liberal way of saying that they used to fuck once in a blue moon when they were both lonely, but then Jen saw past her facade and ended things. Agatha couldn’t blame her, it was why she kept any romance purely physical. “Are you trying to turn me on, darling?”</p><p>Jen grimaced, following Agatha into the office and slamming the door shut. “Your mother only calls when she’s pissed. Are we all about to be fucked?”</p><p>“Profits are down.” Agatha flopped into her chair, unbuttoning her suit jacket. “MGM, Hilton—huge corporations are outdoing independent resorts more and more each year. We can’t keep skimming at the rate we were five years ago and still come clean enough for the IRS.”</p><p>“Does Evanora know that?”</p><p>“I’ve told her as much,” Agatha sighed, picking up the phone off the receiver. “I will do it again.”</p><p>Jen’s eyes went wide, reaching for the doorknob. “Fuck, I’m not staying for that.”</p><p>She slumped in her seat, watching as Jen ran for the hills while the line trilled. It rang twice before there was a click, followed by, “The last drop was short, you better have an explanation as to why that is, or why you’re unreachable when the sun is up.”</p><p>Agatha pulled the phone away for a second, lolling her head back against her chair and <i>slamming</i> it forward and back again. She cleared her throat, bringing the phone back to her ear. “Mother-”</p><p>“I don’t have you out there to galavant, Agatha,” Evanora spat. “The Mirage is opening next year, that’s a 700 million dollar resort. You’re asleep at the wheel.”</p><p>“The Mirage is corporate, we can’t compete with that,” she replied, keeping her voice as even as possible. “Even with our other properties, we’re not going to keep up.”</p><p>“Vegas is projected to add 30,000 more rooms in the next five years,” her mother condescended. “Most of those being family-friendly mega resorts that’ll take <i>our</i> customers! It’s your job to stay on top of this! Drops are getting lighter and lighter each year….” There was silence for a beat, then, “Are you stealing from me?”</p><p>She had no reason to steal, the cut he got was more than enough. Agatha didn’t even want to be doing this to begin with, making an enemy of her mother wouldn’t benefit her in any shape or form. It wouldn’t fix the things she missed most, it wouldn’t bring anyone back.</p><p>“Yes,” she retorted. “I’m skimming off what I skimmed in order to become your competitor, because pissing you off worked out <i>so well</i> for the last guy.”</p><p>“You’re not funny,” Evanora hissed. “Add a new attraction, expand the entertainment. I don’t care.”</p><p>“The feds are already breathing down my neck, mother,” Agatha said through clenched teeth. “And if they take me down, guess who’s next on their list.”</p><p>“Foolish girl.” And of course her mother ignored the logic when it didn’t serve her. “You barely broke two million last year, either fix it or I’ll fly there myself-”</p><p>“That won’t be necessary, I got it.” Agatha threw the phone back into the cradle, dropping her face into her hands and trying to calm her breathing. She had been held at gunpoint more times that she could count, and yet nothing made her blood run cold like Evanora. There was a knock at the door, Agatha calling out, “Come in,” through her hands.</p><p>“I couldn’t find Jen, and I know she makes the schedule.” Rio’s voice announced. “But I just-” Footsteps came to an abrupt stop, the younger woman’s gaze piercing her. “Agatha?”</p><p>She let her hands go limp, her arms resting on the desk. Agatha blew out a sharp breath, “Yes?”</p><p>“Um, I was gonna say that I’m switching shifts with another waitress on Sunday-”</p><p>“No,” Agatha barked. “You don’t work Sundays.”</p><p>Not Sundays, never Sundays.</p><p>“I know that,” Rio slowly responded. “But, Sue wants to spend time with her kid so I offered.”</p><p>“I’ll talk to Sue, you don’t make the schedule.” She rose to her feet. “You work when I tell you to, and I’m telling you now, <i>you don’t work Sundays.</i>”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, raking her eyes over Agatha. “Why is that? What happens on Sundays?”</p><p>See? Shannon Sarah Holly would <i>never</i> ask her that.</p><p>“Oh, that’s when we sacrifice the virgins, naturally,” Agatha grinned, checking the time on her watch. She crossed the room, stopping just shy of Rio. “The answer is no.”</p><p>Rio gave a saccharine smile, batting her eyelashes. “And if I show up anyway?”</p><p>She leaned in, her voice low in Rio’s ear. “I’d advise against that, baby. I wouldn't wanna have to get <i>rough</i> with you.” Agatha made sure their shoulders bumped as she walked out of the office, pushing through the crowd of endless bodies on the casino floor, but she still felt the presence of that woman behind her. She wound through the masses, reaching Jen at the bar, flirting with Alice by leaning over and playing with the bartender’s tie. “Al, I need something strong.”</p><p>“Got it,” Alice chirped, walking away.</p><p>Jen tilted her head. “How’d it go?”</p><p>“Well…” Agatha looked over her shoulder, Rio standing there completely unbothered. “Do you not have drinks to sling?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes, plucking her tray off the bartop and stalking away. Agatha returned her focus to Jen, answering, “We have to match two mill or I think I’m gonna be executed in the goriest and most spectacular fashion my mother can conjure up. My guess is firing squad.”</p><p>“Here.” Alice slid a tumbler of scotch across the bar. “Who’s getting the firing squad?”</p><p>“Me,” Agatha whined. “And the FBI is getting suspicious, I’ve dodged at least two calls from Rambeau.”</p><p>“Again?” Jen bristled. “That woman is relentless.”</p><p>“Well, she has good reason to be,” Agatha grumbled over a sip. “They’re due for their annual visit soon.”</p><p>“We’re clean, right?” Alice nervously questioned.</p><p>“On paper?” She cocked her head, raising her brows. “Squeaky. As always.”</p><p>“I-” Jen began but was suddenly interrupted.</p><p>“Two jack and cokes, one paloma, and <i>three</i> atomic bomb martinis.” Rio slapped down a piece of paper, sliding it over to Alice. “Now, what were we discussing?”</p><p>Agatha worked her jaw for a moment, turning to look at her. “Where the best place for body disposal is.”</p><p>“Probably Lake Mead, right? Thirty miles southeast of here, I think.” Rio haughtily pursed her lips, quirking a brow. “Secluded, water breaks down flesh over time, bones fall to the bottom and erode until they're unidentifiable. Also nontoxic to the marine life residing in the lake, which is definitely a pro in my opinion."</p><p>Her lips parted in shock, because that was actually the correct answer. Agatha had dumped many a corpse at that exact location for the reasons Rio just listed off. “You’re a bit fucked in the head, huh?”</p><p>“You asked,” she drawled, stuffing her hands in the pockets of her jeans—which still were not within dress code. “Or, was it rhetorical?”</p><p>Agatha had the overwhelming urge to put Rio in a jar and study her, because no normal person says shit like that unless they’d really thought about it before. She bit her lower lip, deciding not to take the bait. “I’ll keep that in mind.”</p><p>Alice loaded up the drinks, marking off the ticket and setting it on the tray. Rio didn’t say a word as she sauntered off, her eyes lingering for longer than need be. Jen whipped her head to stare daggers at Agatha. “Remind me why she’s here?”</p><p>“Eh.” Agatha fiddled with her drink, shrugging. “She’s too pretty to be dead or imprisoned.”</p><p>“You make me feel so violent sometimes,” Jen griped.</p><p>“Well-” Agatha was swiftly cut off by the sound of hollering, swiveling around to see Rio at a table of men. Her tray was now empty as she batted a man’s hand from the small of her back. “Fuck.”</p><p>It wasn’t an <i>irregular</i> occurrence, female wait staff or performers being assaulted or harassed. Men drank, and they somehow thought that entitled them to placing their hands on her employee’s bodies. Agatha stormed across the floor, diligent about weaving past the tables. She caught the man’s wrist just as he was about to cop a feel of Rio’s ass, harshly wretching it back so the bone went taut against his skin. “Hi boys,” Agatha snickered. “What’s going on here?”</p><p>“Nothing,” the man strained out, trying to act tough.</p><p>“It didn’t <i>look</i> like nothing to me.” She pointed to Rio beside her. “It looked like you were groping one of my waitresses.”</p><p>“He was,” Rio muttered.</p><p>“No, I wasn’t,” he winced as Agatha applied more pressure. “There’s been a misunderstanding.”</p><p>“Really?” Agatha furrowed her brows in faux confusion, a wave of possession clouding her mind. “By all means, clear things up.”</p><p>“She- she seemed into it,” he accused, glaring at Rio. “She’s been flirting with me since we got here.”</p><p>She heard Rio whisper behind her, “Asshole.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, leaning down just a bit and lowering her voice. “She is doing her job. She’s nice because that’s part of the gig, but you already know that. And even if she <i>was</i> flirting with you, the wedding ring on your finger tells me some other unlucky woman is cursed with stomaching you.” She quickly twisted her hold on his wrist until she felt and heard the bone <i>crunch</i>, a strangled shriek exiting the man’s throat a millisecond later. “Get the hell out of my casino, and if you <i>ever</i> touch one of my employees again, I’ll take away your hand privileges away altogether. Do you understand me, or am I going to have to drag you out?”</p><p>The man was gasping for air through his cries, but nodded anyway.</p><p>“Fantastic!” She dropped his wrist, ushering out her hand for him to follow. “C’mon, thatta way.”</p><p>He got up, cradling his wristing and basically wailing as his buddies got up too, murmuring the usual shit men did when a woman told them no. <i>“Bitch.”</i></p><p>Agatha looked at the dealer, pointing to the chips and cards. “Clean this up, make sure the chips are taken back to the front desk.” She wrapped an arm around Rio’s waist, tugging her from the spot. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio let herself be led, sitting on a stool once they got back to the bar. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“Can’t believe it took ‘em a month,” Jen said, rounding the bar and grabbing a bottle of wine. “I think it was two weeks for me.”</p><p>“Wanda had some perv on her second day,” Agatha added, passing the glass of wine Jen had poured over to Rio. “Welcome to hospitality.”</p><p>Rio chugged the glass, and Agatha couldn't focus on anything other than following the line of her throat. The skin appeared so soft, and the column of neck was calling to her—Agatha wanted to feel it underneath her teeth. “I’m good, I’ve dealt with shittier men than him.”</p><p>“Pray tell, who, sweetheart,” Agatha quipped.</p><p>“Did you break that guy’s wrist?” Rio seemed to come back to herself, shoving the glass over to Jen for a refill. “I was guaranteed pistol whipping.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, the first time she had genuinely smiled all day. “I’ll pistol whip the next one for you, how about that?”</p><p>Rio smirked, her pupils dilating enough even under the low lighting and the haze of smoke that Agatha could tell. “<i>Promise?</i>”</p><p>“Careful, someone might think you want me to hurt men for your own amusement,” Agatha challenged.</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against her cheek. “And if I do?”</p><p>Oh, Agatha needed to get a fucking grip. The only thing stopping her from actually <i>doing</i> something like locking Rio in the nearest vacant room was the ringing of the phone behind the bar. Every station in the hotel had them as an easy way for staff to communicate and coordinate with one another. In any other circumstance, whoever was calling wouldn’t matter to her, except when Jen picked it up and immediately hung up after about thirty seconds.</p><p>“Agatha.” Jen nodded towards the lobby before taking off.</p><p>God, what now?</p><hr/><p>As Jen and Agatha bolted, perhaps Rio’s curiosity got the better of her. Can you really blame her? The woman had just <i>snapped</i> some prick’s wrist for her, and she was not struggling to return to earth mentally because of the man’s hands on her body, no, it was because her stomach was in knots at the thought of Agatha doing worse. There was this heat licking up her spine and coiling in her belly, the chivalry and brutality was mesmerizing. The way Agatha didn’t even hesitate to inflict real pain on a dude who was probably twice her size, like she just <i>knew</i> she’d win. What if he tried to swing? What if he was armed? Agatha didn’t care, she didn’t think twice, she was fearless.</p><p>Once in the lobby, there was a screech of, “<i>Auntie Agatha!</i>” A toddler who couldn’t have been more than three or four bounded towards the older woman as fast as his tiny legs could carry him.</p><p>Agatha hastily shoved aside her suit jacket, untucking her gun from her waistband and handing it off to Rio. “Hold this.” She crouched down, grinning wildly, arms outstretched to catch the small child. “Tommy! What are you doing here, bud?”</p><p>Rio’s brain stuttered at the stark difference in Agatha’s demeanor, gentle and tender as she caught the little boy. The gun in her hands didn’t even register as she looked on, watching as this woman who’d just threatened a man melted with a child.</p><p>With the boy safely in Agatha’s hold and balanced on her hip, Tommy answered, “Mommy,” and pointed to Wanda at the check-in desk. Oh, fuck. Wanda was in some jeans and a sweater, hood up, with a turtleneck beneath, but what caught Rio’s attention was the bruising around her eye, as if someone had punched her at full force.</p><p>The redhead came over, sniffling as she silently tugged down the collar of her turtleneck, revealing the black and blue marring in the shape of fingers. “He swung at Tommy, I-” Wanda’s voice trembled as she let the fabric go. “I stepped in the way to block him.”</p><p>Agatha’s face didn’t falter for Tommy’s sake, her tone light despite the rage bubbling under the surface. “You need a room for the night, then.” Her eyes scanned the toddler. “He seems fine.”</p><p>“I grabbed my keys and threw him in the car once I got Vis off me,” Wanda wept. “I- I thought he was getting better, I should’ve fucking listened.”</p><p>Rio decided to look at the floor in the moment, because she didn’t trust herself not to have a reaction. She couldn’t imagine having a kid to worry about while enduring abuse like that, couldn’t imagine defending your child from his own father. Instead, Rio focused on the intricate carvings of Agatha’s gun, that was the only way she was getting through this.</p><p>“It’s not your fault, hon,” Agatha soothed. “We’ll get you guys a room,” She spoke directly to Tommy before gazing up at Wanda. “Maybe take him to the pool, get yourself on camera.”</p><p>Rio raised her head, flitting her eyes between the two women.</p><p>Wanda took a deep breath. “Agatha-”</p><p>“You’ll need an alibi,” she finished, handing Tommy to his mother. “Jen, give them the suite across from mine, okay?”</p><p>“That’s five grand a night,” Jen squeaked.</p><p>“It’s already vacant, it’s not like we’re losing money.” Agatha wheeled around to Rio. “I’ll take that back now.”</p><p>“Oh.” She held out the gun. “Right.”</p><p>The older woman tucked it away, playfully scrunching her nose at the little boy. “You wanna sleepover tonight?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Tommy cheered, excitedly kicking his legs despite being on Wanda’s hip.</p><p>Wanda seemed devoid of emotion, but she kept a smile on her face for her son. “Agatha, you don’t have to-”</p><p>“And what if you don’t get away next time?” Agatha cut in. “What if he goes after Tommy again?”</p><p>“He’s Tommy’s father,” Wanda croaked. “He’s my husband…”</p><p>Agatha took a couple steps forward, covering Tommy’s ears. “He’ll kill you, Wanda. Maybe in a week, maybe in a year. But, if you stay, you’re staying knowing that.”</p><p>Rio didn’t even have to know the guy in question to know Agatha was right.</p><p>Wanda frantically nodded, peering down at her son. “You wanna go to the pool, baby?”</p><p>“Can we play sharks?” The tiny voice questioned, none the wiser.</p><p>Agatha ran her hand through his hair. “Pick out whatever you want from the giftshop, on me.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Wanda mumbled, maybe out of shame, maybe out of guilt. “I’ll pay you back, I swear.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said with no room for argument. “Go upstairs, order room service, buy him some trunks. Just make sure you get out of your room tonight.”</p><p>“Okay,” her voice shattered, Jen pointing to the front desk and walking away with her and Tommy.</p><p>“Get back to the floor,” Agatha solemnly said, “I’ll be back in a little bit.”</p><p>“Wait.” Rio caught her by the bicep. “One, it’s still light out. Two, you’ll also need an alibi.”</p><p>Agatha sucked her teeth for a beat. “Not necessary, I kind of have local law enforcement in my pocket.”</p><p>“Then why can’t you go to the cops and tell them what her husband did?”</p><p>“Wanda’s husband is the chief of police,” Agatha explained. “How do you think I <i>got</i> local law enforcement in my fucking pocket?”</p><p>“You’ve got a wife beater on your payroll?” Rio pulled back like she had been burned.</p><p>“Hey, don’t judge me. I gave Wanda this job to keep her out of that house, and I always told her I’d handle it whenever she gave me the greenlight to do so.” Agatha raised her brows. “I’ve gotten the greenlight, so if you’ll excuse me…”</p><p>“Give me a ride home.” The words slipped out of Rio’s mouth before she was aware she’d said them.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I’ll be your alibi.” She discreetly nodded towards the camera near the front entrance. “We’ll leave together, if the cops actually investigate the death of their buddy, I’ll say you were with me.”</p><p>“You know what I’m about to go do, and yet you're offering me your help.” Agatha’s eyes lit up like she was studying a foreign species. “Why?”</p><p>“I’ve <i>been</i> Wanda,” Rio quietly admitted. “I’ve been her and if you can balance the scales, then you should.”</p><p>Her face relaxed, those razor sharp features becoming soft in a way Rio didn’t know they could. “Okay, let’s go.”</p><p>She was silently grateful Agatha didn't pry for more information, which on a normal day wouldn’t have been the case, but she didn’t. Agatha didn’t say anything as she opened her car door for Rio, or as Rio threw her vest in the backseat. The drive was different from the one before, there was no music or chitchat. And she had a sneaking suspicion it wasn’t because Agatha was going to kill a man, but because she didn’t want to upset Rio.</p><p>Wanda’s house was unassuming, located in one of the swankier suburbs outside the city. Agatha parked across the street as the sun began to set, vibrant hues of purple and oranges in the sky. She killed the engine, warning, “Do not leave this car, do not get out, do not go inside.”</p><p>“You’re five foot fucking five and you’re trying to take down a fully grown man-”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha growled. “Do. Not. Get. Out.”</p><p>She sagged in her seat, giving no verbal confirmation as Agatha got out. The top was actually up on the convertible for once and the street was a ghost town, so maybe she had a chance in hell of actually pulling this off. But, then the minutes passed and an eerie feeling settled in her gut. Why wasn’t there a sound of gunshots, why hadn’t she come back.</p><p><i>Don’t get out of the car.</i></p><p><i>Bite me,</i> Rio thought as crossed the street, the sun now low in the horizon.</p><p>She paused at the door, the muffled sounds of grunts and what she inferred to be a body hitting the ground. The knob twisted without a fight as Rio slipped inside, craning her neck around. The entryway was <i>nice</i>, and the living room was <i>nice</i>, and the photos were <i>nice</i>. It was the <i>nice</i> home of a <i>‘nice’</i> family.  Is that always how it looked from the outside? Simple, conservative, nuclear. Good people with good values in public, only for the worst shit to happen behind closed doors.</p><p>There was a crash in the kitchen that caught her attention, sprinting towards the noise. Her feet turned to stone as she processed the view in front of her—Agatha’s gun on the floor, a blonde man well over six feet tall with a handgun pressed to Agatha’s jaw, and Agatha herself pinned to a wall by her throat.</p><p>And <i>that</i> would explain why she hadn’t returned to the car.</p><p>The solution was obvious, and Vision didn’t know she was here, he was too busy strangling Agatha.</p><p>“She is <i>lying,</i>” he spat.</p><p>Rio would give it to her, Agatha didn’t allow him the satisfaction of her fear. “So she strangled herself.” Her eyes flew down to his hand around her throat. “Gotta say, Vis, you don’t make a compelling argument.”</p><p>Rio moved at a snail’s pace as she picked up Agatha’s ground off the floor. Even if she was screaming internally, the best thing to do was remain calm in her movements.</p><p>He used his hold on her throat to <i>bash</i> her head into the wall. “You’re...you’re not listening to me, Agatha.”</p><p>Blue eyes became fuzzy as she hoarsely muttered, “A concussion won’t help me hear better, you prick!”</p><p>Her stride across the kitchen were precise as she turned off the safety and pressed the barrel to the back of his head. “Let her go.”</p><p>He froze, eyeing her through his peripheral. “Who the hell is this one?”</p><p>Agatha clawed at his wrist but he didn’t budge. “Isn’t she neat? Wanda trained her.”</p><p>“Let her go,” Rio repeated, her finger on the trigger. She was stalling, of course, she’d never killed a man and crucify her—she was having a little trouble committing. “<i>Now.</i>”</p><p>His hand finally released her, Agatha gulping down new air as her windpipe was freed. Vision held up his hands, darkly chuckling, “You’re gonna shoot me, to save <i>her</i> of all people?”</p><p>Rio didn’t get her response in before Agatha kneed him in the groin and caused him to keel over, his gun clattering to the floor. She swiped her own from Rio’s hand and commanded, “Look away.”</p><p>Her sights were glued to the other woman as she pressed the barrel to his temple—a gunshot ringing out next very next second. She couldn’t look away, not as her jaw dropped, not as her skin was splattered with something warm. Rio didn’t move her fucking eyes as the man fell to the ground, a pool of blood already seeping out. She just…stood there. What did brain matter look like? Was that what was covering the backsplash now?</p><p>Agatha rubbed at her neck as she shoved her gun back in its rightful place, her voice like gravel when she said, “Do you ever fucking listen?”</p><p>“He would’ve killed you,” Rio replied, but her voice felt so far away. Her ears were ringing, like she was underwater.</p><p>“I had it under control,” she rasped, then wandering her gaze along Rio’s current state. Agatha shucked off her suit jacket, throwing it over Rio’s shoulders. “C’mon, we only have a couple minutes before someone calls the cops about the sound.”</p><p>“Should we move him or something?” She asked, Agatha pushing her out of the house.</p><p>“No. The less shit we touch, the better.” The sky was dark as Agatha stuffed her in the car, casually pulling away from the curb and driving as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Her body swayed as the tires treaded over the pavement, zoning out and staring at the dashboard.</p><p>Well, she had lied to Lilia, because she’d definitely just gotten wrapped up in something.</p>

<p>Ravens are solitary birds—highly curious and often territorial. Ravens are omnivores, so they have no need to consume other animals, yet they are exquisite predators. Ravens are scavengers, they are collectors, known to protect and cherish tiny delicate scraps. The most worthless sliver of nothing can catch a raven’s eye as long as it is shiny enough; coins, tin foil, glass, wet stones. Items of little to no value are kept by the raven, held as something close to sacred. A raven was not a threat to other birds unless provoked, more often than not. <i>Agatha</i> was not a threat unless provoked. <i>Agatha</i> collected delicate scraps, protected her people. Alice, Jen, Wanda, and now Rio. Rio curled her fingers in Agatha’s jacket as the older woman pulled into the trailer park, the dust kicking up behind her tires.</p><p>Not a word spoken between the two of them on drive, the older woman just kept her head forward, elbow resting out the window. Rio hadn’t spoken, not out of fear or shock, but out of an emotion she had yet to identify. She wasn’t upset about Vision, perhaps slightly upset about the state of Agatha’s throat. It matched Wanda’s now, black and blue imprints of fingers now inked onto her skin. That actually upset Rio quite a bit, but she knew if she asked how Agatha was doing, Agatha would dismiss any worries in an instant.</p><p>Agatha turned the key in the ignition, shutting off the car and angling her body towards Rio. “Make sure the neighbors see you, shower, burn your clothes, go to bed, and don’t tell <i>anyone</i> anything. You finished your shift, I drove you home, you went to bed.”</p><p>“I got it,” Rio finally spoke.</p><p>“Um.” She wetted her bottom lip, working her jaw for a moment. “Don’t worry about coming in anymore, consider your debt paid.”</p><p>Rio’s neck nearly snapped from how harshly she whipped her head. “What? It’s only been a month.”</p><p>“Look, you were right. If you hadn’t been there tonight, he probably would’ve whacked me and then gotten a fucking medal from the mayor for taking down an organized crime ringleader-”</p><p>“Mob boss,” Rio interjected.</p><p>“I resent that,” Agatha pouted. “Mob implies that there is a collaboration between more than one family. I’m insular, baby.”</p><p><i>Ravens are solitary birds.</i></p><p>“No.”</p><p>“No…?” Agatha squinted at her.</p><p>“No, this isn’t over.” She tilted her head toward her house. “You wanna come in?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes trailed over, then back to her. “Ri, I really need you to understand that this isn’t a life I would even choose for myself, let alone someone as innocent as yourself.”</p><p>“Who said I’m innocent?” Rio furrowed her brows. “I’m at least an accessory to a murder, if not a co-conspirator.”</p><p>“You didn’t pull the trigger, I did.”</p><p>Yes, and how fucking hot she looked while she weilded that gun would stay with Rio for a very, very long time.</p><p>“Walk me to the door,” Rio demanded. “Couldn’t hurt for you to be seen, too.”</p><p>“I don’t normally mingle with-”</p><p>She opened her door, climbing out. “Now.”</p><p>Agatha groaned like a crotchety old man, but got out, shuffling after Rio as she reached her trailer. The park was obscenely quiet for a Saturday night, Agatha lingering behind her as she dug her keys out of her pocket. If Rio played her cards right, she could have this woman in bed on her back and gasping for air in the next ten minutes. Her body was <i>thrumming</i>, not from adrenaline, but from Agatha.</p><p>“Rio!” Tony called out, pacing over manically. “It’s the second, where’s your rent?”</p><p>Rio’s rent didn’t exist because she used the leftover money from last month to catch up on her water bill since electricity she could bear to lose, but didn’t find much comfort in not being able to shower. Her tips basically only provided enough to live day to day, so—she had no rent. Yes, that would be an issue, but maybe he could talk to Tony about some sort of payment plan? She had $50 to her name, that was an…adequate start. Aside from the crime, Rio actually really needed that waitressing job. Fake flirting with men was rapidly losing its appeal the longer she was in proximity to an attractive older butch.</p><p>She pulled Agatha’s jacket tighter, too aware of the blood staining her skin and shirt. “Tony, if you just give me a little more time-”</p><p>“Tony!” Agatha gasped like she was running into an old friend. “This must be kismet, just the guy I was looking for!”</p><p>“Oh, shit.” He froze much akin to a deer in headlights, halting and going pale. “Agatha-”</p><p>She uncuffed her sleeves, rolling them up just below her elbow as she took a couple steps towards him. “You’ve got quite the tab, dude.” She sucked in a sharp breath and pulled a face of concern. “My pet tells me you haven’t paid the last couple times, I’ve been meaning to catch up with you.”</p><p>He smiled in the way that told everyone that he knew he was in trouble. “I- I’m gonna need some more time.”</p><p>“I should think so. You’re, what, two grand in the hole?” Agatha nodded her head towards Rio. “But you should’ve collected rent from all your tenants yesterday, no? Or did you already spend it all at the racetrack?”</p><p>“I’ll get it to you,” he promised.</p><p>“Well, there’s really no alternative, is there,” Agatha grinned, playing with this poor man. “How about I subtract the cost of Rio’s rent from your debt, and I give you til’ next month to get the rest to me?”</p><p>He looked at her, then back to Agatha. “Yeah, uh, that’s reasonable.”</p><p>“Amazing,” she stated, placing a hand on the small of Rio’s back. “So glad we could work that out.”</p><p>The touch, even through fabric, <i>burned</i>. She cleared her throat, unlocking her front door as Tony stalked away. “You didn’t have to do that,” Rio muttered, swinging the door open.</p><p>Agatha ignored that, eyes widening in horror at the interior of her home. To recap—this woman just murdered someone without so much as flinching, but appeared ill at the confined quarters Rio lived in. “Christ, it’s a fucking sauna in here,” Agatha blanched, standing in the doorway. “You live like this?”</p><p>Rio pointed to the wall. “AC is broken,” she gave an awkward chuckle. “And they turned off my power, so even if it <i>did</i> work…still shit outta luck.”</p><p>Blue eyes roamed, her head then ducking in to see the kitchen, but never stepping inside. “Your window is broken too.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio sighed. “It came like that.” She threw her keys on the table, staring at the woman who was merely staring back. “Are you gonna come in…?”</p><p>“You said to the door.” Agatha placed her hands on either side of the doorway. “I’m at the door.”</p><p>Rio slowly approached her, leaving a foot of space between them. “Do you enjoy toying with me?” She lingered on Agatha’s lips before meeting the other woman’s gaze. “You seem to derive pleasure from being as difficult as possible.”</p><p>“And you don’t?” Agatha shot back, swaying forward fractionally. “Why didn’t you listen when I told you to stay in the car?”</p><p>“You hadn’t come back yet.”</p><p>“And when I told you to look away?”</p><p>Rio gravitated even closer, until their faces were inches apart. “I didn’t want to.”</p><p>“Why?” Despite her voice being hoarse, Agatha’s tone was soft.</p><p><i>Ravens are omnivores, so they have no need to consume other animals, yet they are exquisite predators.</i></p><p>“Morbid curiosity,” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha scoffed in disbelief. “Try again, sweetheart.”</p><p>“You like using pet names for me, any reason why that is?”</p><p>“You like seeing me hurt people, any reason why <i>that</i> is?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes, delicately running her fingers along the collar of Agatha’s shirt. “They’re not people, they’re men.”</p><p>“You’re not afraid of me?” Agatha almost appeared offended, if not slightly surprised.</p><p>Fuck, this woman loved talking way too damn much. Rio tugged on her collar, a breath away from actual contact. “You haven’t given me a reason to be.”</p><p>Agatha caught Rio’s wrist, removing it from her collar. She didn’t drop it however, keeping her fingers tightly coiled around the bone. “I could snap your wrist like I snapped that man’s.”</p><p>She wouldn’t, Rio knew she wouldn’t.</p><p><i>A raven was not a threat to other birds unless provoked, more often than not.</i></p><p>So, “Do it,” Rio smirked. “Go ahead.”</p><p>Agatha clearly wasn’t expecting the challenge, wasn’t expecting Rio to call her bluff. Her pupils dilated, lips parting. She shuffled in, mouth hovering over hers but never touching. Agatha pressed back enough that the bone went taut against Rio’s skin, the pressure causing a sharp bolt of pain through her forearm. Rio’s eyes slipped shut as a small moan escaped from the back of her throat, wanton and all too real.</p><p>There was nothing said as Rio gasped, a willing victim if Agatha would only go through with it.</p><p>And now <i>both</i> of them knew she wouldn’t.</p><p>“I should get back,” Agatha husked, the words fanning over Rio’s lips before she let go of her, pulling away. “See how Wanda and Tommy are doing.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered open to the picture of Agatha waltzing down the steps and getting in her car, the engine turning over. What the everliving <i>fuck</i> was her problem? She slammed her front door shut, latching the lock and slumping her back against it. Agatha’s jacket was clouding her senses—it smelled of her cologne, an amber and iris blend—and cigarettes. She worked it off, ignoring the crimson splattered along the white of her top. No, she didn’t want to ignore it. Rio wanted to stare at it like one does a fine work of art.</p><p>She brought the expensive fabric to her nose, the scent of <i>Lucky Strike</i> cigarettes hitting her nostrils. The inner lining was probably silk, the garment itself was definitely designer. Rio didn’t consciously unzip her jeans or stuff her hand under the waistband of her underwear. Her brain didn’t explicitly communicate it to her body, but she’d become possessed. The memory of Agatha pressing a gun to that man’s temple would never be clearer than it was right now.</p><p>Her fingertips grazed through the trimmed thatch of hair, over the metal of the piercing she’d gotten in Albuquerque—the same place where she’d also gotten both her tattoos done as a proclamation of freedom. Fuck, she was dripping, and suspected she had been since Wanda’s house. Rio ran her fingers through herself, collecting enough to then easily sink two fingers into her already fluttering cunt. Her face was glued to that jacket as her jaw went slack, too lost in the feeling to care about how unhinged she most certainly looked.</p><p><i>“Look away.”</i></p><p>Rio’s mind replayed the image, the way Agatha’s fingers curled around the grip. Her index finger wrapped around the trigger. Rio’s own fingers began pumping, dragging along her walls as her pussy eagerly swallowed them. The sound of the shot, that fucking ringing. Agatha’s gaze as it wandered of a bloodied Rio. The warm spray as the scarlet hit her skin.</p><p>She sped up, limp against the door as she panted into the fabric. Every part of her was too hot, she could feel the sweat seeping out of her pores. She didn’t fucking care, curling her digits and pretending they were Agatha’s. Exactly how much of her work translated into how she fucked? Agatha didn’t scream <i>tender lover</i> to Rio, and thank god for that. Agatha would be slightly cruel, she’d play with Rio until she was ready to give her what she wanted. That was how Agatha Harkness operated.</p><p><i>“I wouldn't wanna have to get rough with you.</i>”</p><p>Rio wanted it, she wanted that so fucking badly she could taste it.</p><p>Vision’s body slumping—Rio pressed her palm to her clit, grinding her hips for friction. The piercing meant her clit was more sensitive, much more receptive to stimulation. The blood on the wall as he fell to the floor—her knees buckled, catching herself with the hand tangled in Agatha’s jacket. Rio knelt forward, hunched over as her hand furiously fucked into herself. She wasn’t going to last long at this rate, and she didn’t want to. It’d be dirty with Agatha, it’d be hard and fast, it’d be <i>rough.</i></p><p>Rio clamped down on her lower lip as her orgasm barreled through her, her stomach contracting as her cunt pulsed. She wanted to feel Agatha around her, wanted to taste her, hear what Agatha’s moans sounded like. Rio bet they’d sound pretty, that the arch of her spine would be mesmerizing. She flopped down onto the floor, rolling over onto her back and gingerly removing her hand. Her fingers reflected in the neon sign spilling in from next door, the only source of light now. Rio studied them for a beat before exhaling an exhausted breath, eyes tracing over the cracks in her ceiling.</p><p>What a precarious turn of events.</p><p><i> Ravens are scavengers, they are collectors, known to protect and cherish tiny delicate scraps. </i></p><p>Was she a tiny delicate scrap to Agatha?</p><p>Or a toy?</p><p>Maybe neither.</p><p>Maybe nothing.</p><p>Rio hauled herself to sit up, sucking down air as her pulse mimicked a rabbit's thumping foot.</p><p>She should shower and burn these clothes.</p><hr/><p>Agatha reached the top floor of the resort, the one that held her penthouse and the slightly smaller grand suite suite, and absolutely nothing else. There were no cameras in the corridor because Agatha did not need her many, many guests recorded every night. She knocked on Wanda’s door, the redhead opening it almost instantly.</p><p>Green eyes widened in terror at her current state—<i>see,</i> that was a normal fucking reaction. Unlike Rio who might’ve very well been in heat when Agatha left her place. She just had to call her bluff, she just had to fight back. Everyone else saw Agatha clear as day; damaged goods, psychotic, evil. Agatha preferred it that way, someone was less likely to fuck with a psychopath. They were also less likely to pry, to get to know her beyond the surface. Agatha didn’t need people digging, the reputation she currently held had served her well enough for many decades. But Rio? Rio couldn’t leave anything alone.</p><p>“Your neck,” Wanda murmured.</p><p>“We’re matching now.” Agatha raised her chin a bit, smirking. “Yeah, he’s real thoughtful like that.”</p><p>“I am so sorry-”</p><p>“Stop apologizing, hon.” Agatha leaned against the wall, fuck, the high was wearing off and she was starting to drop. Cocaine might’ve perked her up, but it truly did not hold a candle to the rush of taking a life. It wasn’t that Agatha yearned for it, jonesed for it like a junkie—but after a while she stopped trying to ignore the pleasure she got out of it. “He’s gone, you don’t have to feel bad for existing.”</p><p>There was a blur of red, then Wanda’s arms clinging to Agatha’s frame. “Thank you,” she sniffled. “Thank you, Agatha.”</p><p>Yeah, she didn’t really do physical contact that didn’t ultimately result in an orgasm. Agatha tensed, curtly patting Wanda’s back before pulling away. “It was nothing. Fun, even. Get some sleep tonight because the cops will probably be swarming this place tomorrow, ‘kay?”</p><p>Wanda nodded, smiling through tears. “Okay.”</p><p>“I’m gonna go ice my skull now.” She rubbed at the spot which Vision had smashed against a wall. “Goodnight.”</p><p>“‘Night,” Wanda echoed, gently shutting the door.</p><p>Agatha stood at her kitchen island five minutes later with an icepack against her head, hoping it’d stop the throbbing in her head. Since she'd experienced many an injury, she’d consider herself somewhat knowledgeable on what constituted Jen patching her up and what didn’t. Say what you will about Jen and her nursing degree that was now virtually useless now, the woman knew her shit. Agatha limped to her room, letting her weight relax on the king sized bed where Vic and Scratchy awaited her.</p><p>The worst part about coming home—the silence. Vic and Scratchy were well trained, they only spoke on command or when they thought there was an intruder. The penthouse was blanketed in darkness, the neon skyline of Vegas projecting in through the ginormous floor to ceiling windows. For a city so wide and ranging, she sure did spend a lot of her time alone.</p><p>Always alone.</p><p>How much time did Rio spend alone? What did Rio do when Agatha wasn’t around? There were billions of plants in that hovel, so Agatha could only assume gardening was a hobby for the younger woman. How did she live like that? It was sweltering in that tin can, and the window wasn’t good for safety. Agatha didn’t know why, but she’d like for Rio to be safe. She’d like for Rio to have basic accommodations. Or maybe Agatha was just suffering head trauma. Yeah, it was the head trauma. Perhaps she’d fall asleep tonight and never wake up—if only god were that kind.</p><p>Much to her chagrin, Agatha’s eyes opened the next morning. Before noon, this time. She wore a turtleneck under her button up today, greeted by police officers in her lobby. Both of them were men who questioned where she was between the hours of 8PM and 9PM last night. Agatha was the utmost accommodating and compliant interviewee they’d most likely had all week. Stating that Wanda came over for a girls night and so Tommy could swim after she dropped Rio off back home.</p><p>“And your security cameras will reflect that?” One officer sneered.</p><p>“I’ll have all the footage pulled and couriered over by end of day,” Agatha smiled. “I’m so sorry to hear about this, he was a <i>such</i> a good man.”</p><p>And neither cop could call her on it without ratting out their former chief as a scumbag who worked for a crime ring or beat his wife. There wasn’t enough of her DNA to pin her for the crime—god help the mob if they ever figure out a way to test trace amounts.</p><p>“And do you have the contact info for this employee of yours?”</p><p>Actually, no.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even have Rio’s last name.</p><p>“Well-” She was interrupted by the very woman herself entering through the double doors of the casino. Rio had on a <i>very</i> short skirt, combat boots, and a close to sheer green mesh top. Her eyes focused on the younger woman’s tits—fuck, Rio hated bras, ‘casue she never wore them. Other than the divinely slutty outfit Rio was sporting, Agatha was more confused about why she was here. “Speak of the devil.”</p><p>Rio’s hair tumbled down her back as she traipsed over, pushing her sunglasses to sit atop her head. “What’s up here?” She smiled, that charming tooth gap on full display, along with the clueless doe eyes. “We having a party?”</p><p>One of the officers stared at Rio for far too long, as if her presence was simply too hypnotic. “I- um.” His mouth rapidly opened and closed, a faint blush coating his cheeks. “Are you Ms. Harkness’ employee?”</p><p>Rio lightly leaned into Agatha, her voice sickeningly sweet. “Yup.”</p><p>The other officer remained rooted in place, mouth open and unable to form words.</p><p>“We- uh, we’re going to need a statement about last night,” The first officer pushed out.</p><p>“Anything for our boys in blue,” Rio purred. Agatha held back a gag, because the younger woman <i>really</i> laid this shit on thick. For a misandrist who took pleasure in the violent murder of men, she could play them well. “I hope everything is okay.”</p><p>“We just need to know where you were last night between eight and nine, lovely,” The officer gaped.</p><p>She didn’t care for how that pet name rolled off his tongue, perhaps Agatha should cut it out. Rio pursed her lips briefly, flicking her eyes upward as if she were recalling a memory. “Mmm, I think that’s around the time Agatha drove me home.”</p><p>“And someone can vouch for that?”</p><p>“My landlord saw and talked to both of us.” God, even Rio’s voice was different, higher pitched. “Tony Stark should be able to corroborate it.”</p><p>The officer dumbly nodded. “Thank you, Mrs.…?”</p><p>“Vidal,” Rio happily informed. “ And it’s ‘Miss.’”</p><p>He smirked then. “Well, <i>Miss Vidal</i>, could I interest you in drinks sometime?”</p><p>That’s it, he doesn’t get a tongue anymore. Agatha slowly reached under her suit jacket, Rio’s hand covering her own to prohibit her from actually getting her gun.</p><p>She giggled unnaturally, t’sking, “I don’t think my boyfriend would approve, but you’re a sweetheart for asking.”</p><p>His face dropped, grabbing his buddy in embarrassment. “Thank you, ladies. We’ll be in contact if we need more.” Both of the officers left, the rejection seeming to deter them from digging deeper.</p><p>Agatha wrenched her hand from Rio’s, turning on her heel and charging towards the elevator. Fine, if Rio wanted to flirt with men in front of her, she’d go back upstairs and sulk about it privately where she could smash shit. Maybe she’d go out to the desert tonight and shoot a bunch of things made of glass, get out her rage and sharpen her aim. Agatha beat the elevator button, walking in and nearly missing how Rio slipped in right behind her.</p><p>“Where are we going?” Rio snarked as the door closed.</p><p>“<i>We</i> are not going anywhere. <i>I’m</i> going home.” She clicked the <i>PH</i> button, paying no mind to Rio’s sarcastic whistle.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>The elevator began moving, but she kept her eyeline forward.</p><p>“Agathaaaaaa.”</p><p>Her jaw clenched, as did her fists.</p><p>Rio closed the distance, speaking directly into her ear. “<i>A-ga-tha.</i>” Each syllable spoken with purpose, a goading dig. “You gonna ignore me forever?”</p><p>“I told you not to come,” she said, tone low and dangerous.</p><p>“You really think I’d listen?” Rio’s body was cornering her own, a fraction before touching. “Don’t tell me you’re gonna have to get rough with me now, baby.”</p><p>Agatha looked over at her shit-eating grin, eyes twinkling with mischief. She leisurely angled her body, taking her time as a warning. Rio didn’t budge, so who could blame Agatha when her resolve finally shattered into a million pieces on the ground. It was like she could hear the crunching under the soles of her loafers as she backed Rio against the wall, no brute force necessary as Rio got the hint and backed up with each step taken.</p><p>Rio’s head softly hit the wall, her pupils eating away any of the gold in her irises. Agatha’s hand skated over her thigh, over her stomach, over her collarbone, before her fingers wrapped around Rio’s throat. Not squeezing, not yet. “You want my attention, you got it.”</p><p>The younger woman relaxed under her touch, opening her mouth to speak, but Agatha got there first.</p><p>“But you didn’t have put on the sluttiest outfit you own and get on your fucking knees for those pigs,” she spat, her thumb digging in and feeling the spiking pulse beneath it.</p><p>“Far from the sluttiest,” Rio corrected. “You jealous, handsome?”</p><p>And that’s when she <i>squeezed</i>, watching as Rio’s eyes fluttered, as her breath hitched. Agatha couldn’t focus on the pet name, not when Rio became so lost at the constricting around her neck. A pathetic mewl escaping from full lips, Rio’s hands coming to tangle in the lapels of Agatha’s suit jacket. “You’re so fucking easy.”</p><p>The elevator dinged, the doors parting. Agatha released her, taking off down the hall. She hastily swiped the keycard, Rio catching the door before it shut. “I think you’re all talk,” the younger woman shot back.</p><p>“Oh fuck,” Agatha muttered, two sets of four-legged animals bolting towards the foreign voice. Vic and Scratchy ran towards Rio at the door, Agatha snapping at them. “Vic, Scratch. Hey, heel.”</p><p>Both dogs, both trained to know how to literally tear out another human’s jugular, halted in front of Rio. She didn’t even seem to be aware of the low growling of both animals, couching down and gingerly offering her hand for them to sniff. “Hello, who are you guys?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t-”</p><p>Both Vic and Scratchy gave a sniff, the younger woman then timidly giving each one a gentle pet on the head. Rio’s face lit up, a small pout on her face. “Aren’t you two the cutest boys in the whole wide world.”</p><p>She’d had them literally maul people before, her animals—much like her—were not quick to trust a stranger. Agatha pointed to Vic, the lankier one of the two, a deep brown rather than a true black coat. “Vic is a girl. Short for Victoria.”</p><p>“My apologies, querida,” Rio beamed as she scratched under Vic’s jaw, cooing, “Princesa needs a prettier collar.”</p><p>It was a simple green collar to Scratchy’s purple, not that Agatha had really gone all out when collar shopping to begin with. “Not every girl is a princess,” Agatha snorted.</p><p>Brown eyes peered up. “But I can tell she is.” Rio let Vic nuzzle into her neck, trying to keep a hand on Scratchy as well. “They’re both so beautiful.”</p><p>“Thanks, I got them off some asshole a few years back. Ran a dog fighting ring, hence the scar on Vic’s snout,” she explained. “Scratchy was the runt of the litter, so he’ll feel that bullshit in his later years.”</p><p>Rio frowned, speaking directly to both dogs. “I’m so sorry, I hope he’s dead now.”</p><p>“Oh, he is,” Agatha replied. “You’re not scared of them?”</p><p>She tilted her head as she echoed, “They haven’t given me a reason to be.” Rio then stood up, motioning to both animals. “You didn’t dock their tails or pin their ears…”</p><p>“Why would I inflict torture on two innocent creatures? They’re not humans, they don’t deserve that.”</p><p>Rio chuckled under her breath, rounding the island. “The big, scary butch mobster has a soft spot for dogs.”</p><p>“Mobster is just as inaccurate as mob boss,” she mumbled, bracing her hands behind her on the counter. Vic and Scratchy took off down a hall, finding a new thing to become interested in after confirming that Agatha was safe and that Rio was not a threat.</p><p>Rio didn’t stop until they were pressed flush against one another. “You know what I think?”</p><p>“I try not to know what goes on in your head.”</p><p>“I think you want so desperately for me to fear you, ‘cause that’s easier.” Her fingers toyed with the top button of Agatha’s shirt, as if she had every right to do so. “Why?”</p><p><i>Because you scare me.</i></p><p>No one had ever seen Agatha in action and stuck around the next day, but RIo went out of her way. Rio didn’t scream, or run, or even so much as judge—Rio came back. Her heart rate spiked as a button was popped, the other woman expectantly awaiting an answer.</p><p>“You liked it, didn’t you,” Agatha deflected. “You got off on it.”</p><p>“Mmh,” Rio hummed. “I did…<i>literally.</i>”</p><p>Fine, fine. She gave up. A beautiful woman was admitting to masturbating to Agatha heinously taking a man’s life. She shot forward, crashing her lips against Rio’s—finally, fucking finally. The younger woman willingly opened her mouth, her tongue swiping out and running over Agatha’s own. She greedily groped at Rio, her hands grabbing at her ass and palming the flesh. Rio made a sound, a whine that was crumpled and caught on her vocal cords, rocky and jagged.</p><p>Agatha took it in stride, snaking her hands under the skirt and dragging her nails along soft skin. She lurched forward, causing Rio to bend back, using the momentum to catch Rio’s bottom lip between her teeth. And <i>just</i> as she was about to bite down, the phone rang.</p><p>“Ignore it,” Rio forced out in between attaching her mouth to Agatha’s, bringing her fingers to fist in her locks.</p><p>Yeah, she wished she could.</p><p>However, if that was her mother and she missed it, Agatha couldn’t keep her at bay. In all honesty, she probably shouldn’t have been copping a feel of her employees ass after traumatizing said employee. Not to mention the age difference, Rio couldn’t have been more than 25? 26? She felt more guilt about that than Vision's brains blown out and smeared across Wanda’s artisanal kitchen tile.</p><p>Agatha gently pushed Rio back, wiping her bottom lip free of saliva. “Gimme a minute.” She needed her body to stop vibrating, she needed her clit to stop beating. Rio huffed, crossing her arms like a petulant child. “Yeah?” Agatha asked as she picked up the call.</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen’s voice carried through the speaker, her customer service one that was artificial. “I need you to come down to the lobby, Agent Rambeau is here. She’s asking to speak to you.”</p><p>The feds and the cops circling her like vultures—must be her lucky day.</p>
