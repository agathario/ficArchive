<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The night was unusually cold for early spring, and the damp chill seeped through her cloak as she stood in the center of the clearing, waiting. Moonlight dappled the forest floor, casting long, strange shadows that seemed to breathe with life of their own. Her coven stood in a circle around her, their faces shadowed under hoods, murmuring softly in unison—a chant. Old words she’d only heard in fragments, whispered and half-forgotten, from ages long past. Tonight they dared to call upon something ancient. Something that hadn’t answered in centuries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps it wouldn’t work. Part of her hoped it wouldn’t work, if only to make the others feel folish. Why should she be made an example of when she hadn’t done anything wrong? Her fingertips itched, maybe something would go wrong. Something that would allow her to dart off. Away through the woods, another village, another life. She could do it. They didn’t understand. They saw the chaos of an untamed wild child who couldn’t control her magic even after a couple of decades. Never mind that not one of them had taken even the slightest interest in teaching her. She knew they were afraid of her. Which meant she must be incredibly powerful. She just didn’t know how to reach that. Not yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She also knew with certainty, that human sacrifices typically had a pretty short window of opportunity to get it together. Her eyes searched, seeking a single face but the hoods obscured her coven. If she could catch her mother’s eye, surely her mother wasn’t going to allow this. Surely, this was just an overreaction to teach her a lesson. Agatha wouldn’t humiliate herself, she wasn’t going to beg. But she would never understand why they couldn’t see—she could be a good witch. Not particularly nice, or helpful, or kind perhaps. But good at being a witch. Powerful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The earth trembled beneath her feet, subtly at first, then with the power of something deep and vast, like the stirring of a slumbering primordial beast. Agatha’s heart hammered against her ribs as she clutched a small bundle of herbs for protection—a ritual comfort more than a shield.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A fissure split the ground at the center of the clearing, revealing a narrow, shadowed path spiraling down into darkness. Cold air surged from below, sharp and biting, carrying the scent of stone and smoke. From the blackness, a figure emerged, stepping not out of, but with the shadows as though they were merely part of her cloak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was a formidable presence, with a piercing gaze that seemed to drink in the moonlight itself. Her eyes were shards of obsidian, and her dark hair spilled over her shoulders in waves smooth as silk. Every line of her face, from the high cheekbones to the slight curve of her lips, seemed chiseled from stone—unmoving, untouched by time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A small gasp escaped Agatha. Beautiful. Curious, she hadn’t expected her to be beautiful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen of Shadows, Lady of the Underworld. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s coven fell silent as she stepped forward. They bowed low, their hands still clasped in reverence. The one who led the ritual—she recognized Helene by those awful heeled boots—spoke with a voice that quivered despite its attempt at formality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We bring the offering as promised,” she said, gesturing to Agatha. “As payment for our continued protection. She is…she is our finest, with powers strong and untamed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen’s gaze settled on Agatha, her expression unchanging. Agatha held her breath, feeling that gaze pierce through her, and she couldn’t help but shiver slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Step forward,” she commanded, her voice as smooth and deep as the shadows themselves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced back at her coven, searching for some flicker of reassurance in their veiled faces. But they remained silent, heads bowed, hands clasped. She was on her own. Steeling herself, she stepped forward, closer than any living mortal had likely been in ages.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Lady took her in for a moment, her head tilting just slightly as she examined Agatha like a curiosity, a specimen. At last, she spoke a faint edge of amusement curling her words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, this is your offering. Tell me, witch, do you come willingly?” The question hung heavy in the air, almost mocking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, her mouth suddenly dry. “I…come as a member of the coven,” she replied, her voice soft but steady. “Our agreement with you binds us to protect the lands above, to keep the seasons in balance. I honor their choice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The smile was cold, knowing. “A well-rehearsed answer.” She circled Agatha slowly, her gaze sweeping over her from head to toe, assessing, weighing her value. “You speak of honor, yet you are unproven. Your magic has not reached you fully.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am good enough,” Agatha replied, lifting her chin. “And I am not afraid of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The coven gasped softly behind her, but The Lady only chuckled, a low, resonant sound. She stepped even closer, so close Agatha could feel the cold radiating from her skin like the breath of a winter storm. She reached out, brushing her gloved fingers along Agatha’s cheek, a surprisingly gentle touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shivered but kept her composure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not afraid, are you?” she murmured. “Then look into my eyes, Agatha of the coven. And tell me—what do you see?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha met her gaze, feeling a strange, pull within those depths. The clearing, the coven, all around them faded. Fragments of vision rushed through her mind. Endless, winding corridors beneath the earth, stone walls lit with blue fire, shadows that moved and whispered, a wicked and curved throne looking upon it all. It was horrifying. It was beautiful.  She did not look away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see…you,” Agatha whispered, her voice barely a breath. “And I see the choice you’re giving me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The taller woman’s lips curved, her eyes gleaming. “Wise enough to know a choice when you see one. Yet you still stand here, willing to face the darkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s darkness but the unknown, and what’s the unknown but an opportunity,” Agatha replied, steadier now. “For my coven.” See? She could be so good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Quen held her gaze a moment longer as if testing her. Then she nodded, her smile fading into something colder, more distant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So be it,” she said, her voice echoing through the clearing. She extended her hand to Agatha, palm up, fingers outstretched—a silent command. “You will spend half your days below and half above, tending the cycles of life and death, bound to my realm as its consort.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, feeling the weight of eternity in that hand. With a final glance back at her coven, who still knelt in reverent silence, she reached forward and took the hand offered to her. The chill sank through her skin, spreading through her like ink in water, freezing and binding her to the Queen of Shadows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will return for you. A few months from now. Be ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, watching intently as her hand was lifted up towards the Queen’s lips. For a brief moment, she thought that she may kiss her hand and that thought made something prickle inside her. But instead, a soft whisper against her knuckles, surprisingly warm breath passing over her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Te veo.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen of Shadows was gone, leaving Agatha and her coven alone in the clearing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The clearing was utterly still, as if Agatha, the coven, the whole world still held its breath. Slowly, the coven raised their heads, watching Agatha with wary, almost fearful eyes. She was bound now, marked by the Underworld’s Queen. There was no turning back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother stepped forward, her lips thin, eyes hard as she regarded Agatha. “You have done what was needed,” she said with a clipped tone. “Our coven will flourish with this bond.” But there was no warmth in her voice, only a tense satisfaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her fists, feeling the weight of her new fate press into her chest as her nails dug into her palms. Her coven’s safety might be assured, but her future belonged to the Queen of Shadows. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they turned to leave, Agatha lingered, looking back over the clearing, memorizing the spot. The fissure in the ground had closed, but she knew the pathway to the Underworld was there, waiting for her, always.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The weight of the Queen’s whispered words echoed in her ears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I see you.”</span>

<p>Green. Everything was green. The smell of overripe fruit hung heavy in the air. Leaves lay wet and dark underfoot, glistening with the aftermath of fresh rain, clinging to her boots as she trudged forward, purposefully leaving tracks in the mud. Normally, she would’ve erased every trace of herself, vanishing into the underbrush like a whisper of wind. But today, she expected to be found. If she was honest with herself, she wanted to be.</p><p>In the weeks following the ritual, life had crept back to its familiar, stagnant pace. Her days empty, as if she'd been hollowed out and stuffed full of dust and clay in place of her own life. Daily, she woke to the same murmurs and side glances from her coven. Every evening she toiled in silent isolation, her power seething beneath her skin, eager, brimming, yet ever unwelcome.</p><p>It was as if, after all the thrill and dread of that ritual, she now existed on the edge of some new invisible precipice. The edge of a knife. It’s not a good sign when your home casts you out so completely that lodging up with death herself seemed like a refreshing change of pace.</p><p>The mist still hung low to the ground, as at first light she wandered out to gather herbs in the woods. She moved through her task, mindlessly, until something caught her eye—a cluster of strange black lilies. As though they had clawed their way up through the soil, they bloomed here curling upwards in long finger-like tendrils, each petal gleamed as if slick with oil.</p><p>She knelt, reaching out to brush her fingertips along one of the petals, but quickly jerked her hand away as it seemed to pulse in response to her touch. The flower seemed to drink in the light, its dark, rippling surface oddly comforting. A message as clear as if it had been whispered directly to her. </p><p><em>She</em> was coming.</p><p>And, for the first time in six months, a surge of emotion. A feeling familiar but that had not been felt since that night. Excitement. She would finally leave this place of endless suspicion, no longer bound to these wary stares and muttered rumors. Life here had always been so quiet, so gray. There was an incredible freedom in the thought of leaving, even knowing she faced something so vast and untamed. Something so completely unknown but undeniably powerful.</p><p>She liked power.</p><p>Agatha surprised herself as she chuckled, fingers running under the delicate petals of the flower. Velvety smooth. For a moment she hesitated, there was good reason travelers warned about taking things from these woods. But perhaps it was a gift and it would be rude not to. </p><p>“Gods it’s just a damn flower,” she growled, exasperated with herself for agonizing over something so foolish. “We don’t need anyone’s permission.” She plucked the flower, hissing in pain as it sprouted a thorn, cutting her. She pressed her finger to her lips sucking away the drop of blood that had sprung up. The flower pulsed again and she watched as a single petal fell, drawn to the cut, binding around it to stop the bleeding. It felt so delicate, like a lover’s kiss. She glanced at the flower again and smiled. Beautiful <em>and</em> dangerous. Just her type.</p><p>She finished gathering the herbs and practically flew back to the cottage. This would be her last day here. At nightfall, she would find the glade. And then she would be taken to <em>somewhere else</em>. For six months. That was time enough out from under the coven’s thumb. The underworld had to be full of magic, unlike anything anyone had seen. A tool, something she could harness and use. By the time she returned here next, everyone would see that Agatha Harkness was undeniable.</p><hr/><hr/><p>Humming softly, Agatha paused, her gaze sweeping over the forest. She found her quarry in an almost perfectly circular clearing. The trees here were different—a stark contrast to the lush life behind her. Their limbs were bare, bark cracked and withered gray as if drained of all color and warmth. Branches jutted out at sharp, disjointed angles, pointing straight up toward the sky like skeletal fingers grasping at clouds. The air here was colder, and her breath came out in short puffs of mist.</p><p>At the clearing’s center, Agatha spun in a slow circle, her coat fanning out around her as she raised her arms in a dramatic flourish. "Here I am!" she called, a mischievous smile tugging at her lips. Silence. She frowned, dropping her hands with a sigh. The art of a dramatic entrance, the thrill of a grand reveal—it was always a delicate game of timing. Well, you win some, you lose some. As she turned back, her breath caught in her lungs.</p><p>The lady of death stood before her. She hadn't heard a single footstep, hadn’t sensed a whisper of presence before Her arrival. Though she had slipped in like a shadow, Agatha felt very clearly the presence that seemed to pull all warmth from the air around them. Agatha’s eyes flicked over her, taking in the stern set of her mouth, the faint, knowing smile just beneath it.</p><p>Something about that smile sparked something in her. Agatha didn’t need her knowing how eager she was to be here. Negotiating always required leverage, and this early, w<em>hen she wasn’t even yet sure what she wanted of her</em>, she couldn’t give a single thing up.</p><p>“You’re early,” Agatha managed, feigning a flicker of annoyance, though her pulse quickened. </p><p>“I missed you.” The words were simple, almost soft. Her dark gaze held Agatha’s, steady and unyielding.</p><p>Agatha huffed,  “Is that so?” She turned away, trying to mask the slight flush rising to her cheeks. "I’d think the Queen of Shadows wouldn’t be so sentimental.”</p><p>The woman’s lips curved ever so slightly as she closed the distance between them. “Think what you want. But here you are. Also, its Rio. The whole Queen of Shadows thing, it’s a mouthful.” She extended a gloved hand, palm up—a gesture surely intended to be commanding but which looked so inviting. “Shall we?”</p><p>Agatha eyed the outstretched hand. No turning back now. She could do worse.</p><p>“Do you plan to stare at my hand all day?” Rio’s voice cut through her thoughts.</p><p>Agatha smirked, her confidence returning. “I thought you <em>liked</em> the anticipation. You waited this long after all.” But she took Rio’s hand, feeling the cold bite through the leather of her gloves. As their hands met, a faint surge of energy hummed between them, like the pulse of hidden magic.</p><p>Without a word, Rio turned, guiding Agatha toward the far edge of the clearing, where the ground seemed to fall away into a shadowed descent. As they stepped forward, the verdant green faded, giving way to earth and rock, every trace of color leaching from the surroundings. Blood draining from the corpse. Agatha felt the weight of the descent press upon her, heavy and ancient. Every step they took seemed to pull her deeper into something colder, darker.</p><p>At last, they reached the mouth of the underworld. It was no more than a narrow archway at the base of a stone outcropping, draped in trailing vines like the grasping tendrils of some deep-rooted thing. Rio’s grip on Agatha’s hand tightened for a heartbeat before releasing.</p><p>“This is your last chance to turn back,” Rio murmured, though her tone held no real expectation. It was an empty offer. A trap. No, It was a <em>trial</em> she realized as Rio quirked an eyebrow back at her. Agatha met her gaze, lips quirking in defiance.</p><p>“Do you think I would back out now?” she replied, her voice steady.</p><p>Rio regarded her for a long moment, eyes glinting in the half-light as if searching for something. Then, with a nod, she turned and stepped into the shadows. Agatha followed, feeling the cold close around her like a shroud. As they entered, the doorway sealed behind them, the last sliver of light vanishing, leaving only darkness and the echo of their steps as they began their descent.</p><p> </p><p>Down. </p><p>Down.</p><p>Down.</p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>They walked in silence. Agatha a step behind Rio. It smelled like moist earth which wasn’t surprising but there was another note of something sharp and slightly acrid. It wasn’t unpleasant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A small breeze drifted past from further down the tunnel. A gasp of warm air taking the quickest path to the surface.  But as the breeze passed her, it was accompanied by a woman’s screen. Goosebumps instantly formed on Agatha’s skin as she startled and leaned back against the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t mind them.” Rio had stopped, glancing over her shoulder. “Just a lost spirit. Sometimes when they first get here they’re… restless.” Her eyes traced over Agatha as if assessing her propensity for fleeing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha forced a laugh trying to contain her nerves. She wasn’t naive, she’d expected to witness the macabre. But she’d envisioned corpses not physically feeling someone’s dying gasps. She fucking hated ghosts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tried for deflection “And here I thought everyone was dying to be here!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The corner of Rio’s mouth almost quirked into a smile. Agatha watched as her tongue pressed into the inside of her cheek. Holding something back? Perhaps death wasn’t humorless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Keep close,” Rio said lowly, turning again to the path ahead. As Agatha focused back on the path ahead she realized the landscape had changed completely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jagged stones like broken teeth jutted out of the rock, marking a path to an immense shadowed archway carved into the mountainside. The arch was illuminated by an etching that glimmered faintly, old runes pulsing a sickly green. She was transfixed, her gaze lingering as she reached a hand to trace her fingertips-</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t.” A stern order as her wrist was grabbed sharply. Agatha winced, Rio hadn’t dropped her hand, instead pulling Agatha away from the arch and towards her. “We don’t touch what doesn’t belong to us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scowled as she looked at her wrist held between them. Rio’s nails began to elongate, sharpen, unsheathing like claws, pressing into her skin. She felt one begin to prick at the vein in her wrist. “You’re going to hurt me.” She said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio seemed unmoved. “I’m not going to hurt you.” Her eyes held Agatha’s for a long moment. “But we need to be very clear about something. There are many dangerous things here. Many things that as my consort you are shielded from. But there are magics of death and magics of fate. I only control the first one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who controls the other?” Agatha asked, trying to hide the hunger in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes before finally releasing her hand. “No one.” She replies. “But if you are hellbent on trying, at least take the time to learn your surroundings before putting your fingers on the first trap glyph you see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A trap? What kind?” Agatha couldn’t help her eagerness this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In an instant, Rio had closed the gap between them, wrapping her hand in the neck of Agatha’s cloak and pushing her backward. There was a flash in her eyes, manic and predatory. As Agatha’s back was forced closer to the archway she began to feel a sharp sting of magic tendrils biting at her back and she wondered if Rio was about to push her into it. “Wanna see?” Rio growled, her smile unsettling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In that moment, she knew Rio was absolutely capable of pushing her into whatever ward and punishment the glyph carried. It was not a good sign for her self-preservation that that knowledge sparked intrigue instead of fear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not really,” she quipped, she wondered briefly if she looked as feral as Rio did. She felt it. “Lesson learned, don’t touch things that don’t ask for it. Consent is sexy and all.” She had a death wish. That was the only explanation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But her cheek was rewarded with an actual chuckle. A quick bark that seemed to surprise Rio as much as it did her. She was pulled back away from the arch, gently this time. Rio’s hands left her and as they did it seemed like the air grew a bit cooler again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have farther to go. Keep up.” She turned away again, walking a well-treaded path, the weight of her presence an anchor pulling Agatha deeper into this strange darkness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They descended a steep path, the ground beneath them rough and uneven, leading into a vast cavern that seemed to expand endlessly in all directions. As her eyes adjusted, Agatha saw what looked like a sprawling city, tucked into the very bones of the earth. Towering spires of black stone, bridges of dark iron twisted above them, connecting structures like a dark web spun by some ancient wrought thread.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything gleamed with a hard, metallic sheen. The stone streets were lit by the glow of dim, ghostly lanterns, casting greenish light across every jagged surface. The lights flickered in time with the eerie, rhythmic hum of machinery somewhere deep below. They were pulsing, as though they were drawing breath, and Agatha shivered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s… larger than I thought,” Agatha murmured, her voice swallowed by the cavernous expanse. “I expected…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s endless,” Rio replied, her tone neither boastful nor humble, simply stating fact. She paused, glancing over her shoulder, her eyes catching the greenish light. “It grows, it changes—just like those who come here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, they reached the edge of the city and at its boundary surprisingly was a train station. An obsidian locomotive spewed black smoke as figures cloaked in shadow, souls just arrived, emptied onto the platform. Agatha watched them with morbid fascination, feeling the weight of her own heartbeat as she saw a group of the translucent figures drift by.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"All your creation?" she asked, her voice hesitant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “Every corner, every shadow. These are my domains. They answer to me—and, parts, to you now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s words lingered, sending a strange shiver through Agatha as they turned and continued their path deeper into the city. The farther they went, the darker and denser the structures became. Buildings rose higher, their facades carved from smooth obsidian, and tall smokestacks belched shadow rather than smoke, strange darkness that seemed to dissolve into the sky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walked through narrow, labyrinthine streets lined with ancient buildings that looked strangely both organic and crafted as if they had grown from the rock itself but had been deliberately manipulated in their construction. Great iron pipes snaked along the ground and up the walls, disappearing into the rock above. Each turn brought them closer to the heart of the city, where the industrial noise grew louder—the sounds of machines turning, and the occasional hiss of steam.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, they came to an intricate gate, wrought from iron and onyx. Beyond lay a secluded part of the city—a vast courtyard garden, where shadows themselves seemed to bloom. Dark roses with jagged thorns, vines with silver-tipped leaves, and trees that looked as though they had been molded from blackened glass grew in eerie, organic harmony.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is the garden,” Rio explained, “I thought you might… it's a place to kill some time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The garden was beautiful and unsettling, wild and strange in a way that Agatha could not yet name. She felt the magic of the place wrap around her. Again she smelled that strange acidic scent from before. Here it seemed stronger. Sweeter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” she said, surprised at the words that came to her. For all its eerieness, the garden felt like an offering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips curved faintly. “It’s yours to tend as you see fit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took another few steps into the garden, feeling the strange, thrumming pulse of the place wrap around her The dark roses and sharp-edged vines drew her attention, each plant more uncanny and beautiful than the last, until she spotted a single flower standing out from the others, half-hidden among shadowed thorns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the same flower she’d seen in the overworld, just before Rio came to collect her—a striking bloom with inky-black petals that shimmered with an otherworldly green iridescence. She kneeled next to it and reached out, almost entranced, the memory of finding it tugging at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio noticed her staring and took a step closer. “You recognize it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Agatha replied, glancing up. “It was growing by my coven’s grounds just before you came for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, thoughtful in her gaze. “A Shadebloom. A marker between worlds. Its roots take hold in both, for a time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her chest tighten, memories of the boredom and longing, her anticipation before Rio’s arrival. As Agatha’s fingertips brushed over the Shadebloom, she felt an irresistible pull—a compulsion to touch it, to hold it. She knew better, of course. It wasn’t exactly a welcoming bloom; it was a messenger, a reminder of all that tethered her here. Yet, despite herself, she let her fingers trail just a little too close to the stem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A sudden sting shot through her hand as a thorn bit into her. She hissed, pulling her hand back and watching as a single drop of blood welled up on her fingertip. The thorn had pricked her deeply this time, as if somehow aware of her hesitation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze flicked down, her mouth almost curling into a smile. “Didn’t we<em> just</em> go over the rules about touching things here?” Her voice was light, and eyes playful in a way that made Agatha’s breath catch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha suppressed the urge to roll her eyes, pressing her thumb to the tiny wound. “Maybe I just like testing my boundaries,” she muttered, her voice carrying a bit defiance and a strange, low thrill she didn’t fully understand blossomed in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her for a moment, her smile fading. She took a step closer, her fingers reaching out as though to touch Agatha’s hand, but stopping just short. “There are… consequences here, Agatha, ones you won’t always see coming.” Her voice softened, her gaze lingering on Agatha’s injured finger. “But sometimes, the pain means you’re growing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t look away, instead meeting Rio’s gaze, that small spark of defiance still lingering. She lifted her finger, still stinging, to examine it closely. “Maybe I don’t mind a little pain,” she said, tilting her head. “Especially if it means the garden remembers me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth quirked slightly, her tone laced with something nearly fond as she replied, “Then I suppose the Shadebloom will keep you in good company.” She plucked it from the soil and twirled it between her fingers for a moment. “If it is tended, it will return,” she said quietly. “Like all things bound to the cycles between worlds.” She kneeled next to Agatha and in a quick but gentle movement tucked the stem into a button loop at the collar of Agatha’s cloak. A pause, then: “This garden will grow as you care for it, Agatha.” Rio stood, brushed the dirt from her knee then abruptly turned and continued walking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, fingers brushing the cool petals— a reminder of her own life now bound between worlds. But also, a gift, a token from the woman who had not asked for her to come here but seemed to be at the least amicable to her presence. She wasn’t at all what Agatha had expected. A cruel captor would’ve been straightforward. Far too easy. But Rio teetered between aloof and something unplaceable so familiar that it twisted her stomach with anxiety.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They continued their walk, moving past the garden and through another darkened corridor. At the end of it, Rio paused before an arched doorway. She pushed it open, revealing Agatha’s quarters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the room was illuminated in a subdued twilight. Arched windows of black and purple crystal let in a silvery glow across the room. The bed was carved from dark whirled wood, with linens in a rich midnight blue. A stone hearth flickered with a cold, silver flame, casting enough light to illuminate several shelves of books, a small table, and a pewter cauldron tucked into a corner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This space is completely yours,” Rio said, watching Agatha’s reaction carefully. “You’ll find things you might need—books, a few familiar plants. Your magic may feel… restrained here. But give it time. The Underworld has its own power.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her eyes drifting over the details, feeling a strange, unexpected thrill in the center of her chest. This space, somewhat austere but comfortable, was hers to shape and command. She could sense Rio’s influence everywhere—the cold flame, the dark crystal—but it felt like an invitation rather than an imposition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had a more human touch than she expected and she wondered, had this been built just for her? Or did Rio lounge on a throne in some macabre mansion somewhere? “Where do you sleep?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced curiously at her arching an eyebrow, “Pardon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I meant, do you sleep? You knew how to do up the room. It’s nice. I didn’t expect you to be an interior decorator.” She said quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everyone needs hobbies.” Rio shrugged, leaning against the door frame. “If you were expecting a crypt, you should’ve had your coven summon a vampire.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Agatha looked back at Rio, feeling a spark of determination and a hint of something she couldn’t place. “Well, thanks. I’ll make it mine,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a single nod. “See that you do. I mean it, it's yours. No one will enter without your invitation. Including myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you weren’t a vampire?” Agatha teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed and rolled her eyes before slipping back into the shadows, leaving Agatha alone to explore the realm that was now hers to share.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Left alone in the cool quiet, Agatha took a long, slow breath. She moved across the room, letting her fingers brush over the edges of the shelves, glancing at the odd assortment of books and trinkets. She wasn’t sure what to make of Rio’s gesture, but there was no denying the care in the details, the deliberate choices in the objects that filled the room. The cauldron, the shelves of old and unfamiliar spell books, herbs hanging in small bundles, even the rich color of the fabrics…there was almost an understanding of who she was. Agatha smirked a little, surprised by the thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the near-silence, Agatha caught again the faintest echo of distant gears grinding, a muffled thrum that seemed to pulse in time with the dim lanterns that cast their glow across the city streets outside her window. Even in stillness, this place was alive with quiet energy, a city that breathed beneath the earth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After a moment, she took another steady breath and walked toward the window, tracing her fingertips along the dark crystal. Her gaze roamed the industrial sprawl of the city below. This place was vast and ancient, strange and alive with its own kind of magic, one she didn’t yet understand. But she would.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She saw figures clad in workwear, large gloves and heavy aprons, moving through the street. More souls? Demons perhaps? She wasn’t sure, the eyes were always a tell but each figure here had them covered by thick goggles. The lenses reflected green light like an animal's eye caught in the dark. But she only saw those glimpses for a moment. They were busy with their work. Some pushed wheelbarrows of coal while others pulled at pulleys manipulating large parts of machinery.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was ominous. It was magnificent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And somewhere within it, Rio was watching over it all. Lording over it all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The question tugged at her, nearly unbidden. Why did she make this place? <em>Why did she give me a place within it?</em></span>
</p><p>
<span>She smirked again, caught in the odd wonder of it all. “Guess I’ll just have to find out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The curiosity simmered, sharpening the restlessness she felt. She left the window and paced back to the door, her fingers grazing the edge of a worn leather spine on the shelf. She picked it up, flipping through pages inked with runes she couldn’t decipher. Perhaps she would try;<em> perhaps</em> Rio would teach her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe, just maybe, she thought with a quiet thrill, there was more for her here than she could have ever imagined.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>She’d let the girl rest. Though she didn’t need it herself, mortal constitutions were more fragile than they realized. Even the spirited ones. <em>Especially them.</em></p><p>She rolled her tongue over the inside of her cheek, running it across a small scar that had formed from many years of biting the inside of it. A bad habit. A reminder she could still feel pain.</p><p>It was a curious business, the coven sending this girl here. She wasn’t one to argue, a witch down below was one less to deal with up above. But she wondered. Why was this one their choice?</p><p>It was undoubtable that Agatha had a strong magic potential. That much was clear in the way the energies of the realm, <em>Her</em> realm, was reacting to the girl's presence. Perhaps that potential had frightened her coven. It was easier to send unruly women away than to deal with them.</p><p>Maybe that’s why she’d accepted the coven’s offer. Too many <em>difficult </em>women were sent to her in such untimely ways as it was. She felt no guilt, it wasn’t her doing, and souls were souls. But as she appraised them she wondered who they could have been, had someone been there to tend to them.</p><p>She wondered idly if Agatha would flourish under a bit of pruning, if given a trellis to wind her magic up and around.</p><p>A train whistle sounded, shaking her from her thoughts. Never mind lost witches. There were souls that needed to be attended to. More souls would be arriving shortly.</p><p>She closed her eyes and felt her body disperse into the atmosphere, her glamour dropping as she flew, half corporeal smoke half something resembling a human form. </p><p>Rio passed through the streets with purpose, slipping into her routine as a way to anchor herself. She began her rounds, checking on the various areas of her domain—the factories where the workers toiled. But even as she carried out her business, her mind kept drifting back to Agatha. The memory of their brief exchange replayed in her thoughts, the challenge in Agatha’s eyes igniting a curiosity that she hadn’t felt in a few centuries. She couldn’t shake how piercing those clever blue eyes were.</p><p>In the heart of the city, where the machinery throbbed with life, each clank and hiss was a brash reminder of her responsibilities. Here, she directed the laborers, guiding their movements with a flick of her wrist, her voice commanding, laced with an authority that had been forged over countless years. The souls executed each order with precision.</p><p>Later, Rio found herself wandering towards the garden once more, a sanctuary amidst the chaos. The one place that carried the reminder of her origin as <em>The</em> green witch.</p><p>Once, she had been the caretaker of the grounds above and below. But as time had drawn on there had been many others to toil in the sun. To grow orchards and bend rivers. To make beautiful fields full of plant and animal life. </p><p>But no one ever wanted to cull the excess. No one but her recognized that there could be no appreciation of beauty without the threat of losing it. So she had taken up the responsibility of trimming back the world. Creating an <em>After</em> so that every living thing could appreciate the present.</p><p>It had been a gift.</p><p>It hadn't been received as one.</p><p>Their loss. For a time she had been bitter. But when you lived infinitely, you couldn't carry any one emotion forever.</p><p>She admired the garden again, the dark roses swayed slightly as if responding to her presence. She knelt beside them, running her fingers over the velvety petals, feeling the pulse of magic that surged within them. She murmured to the flowers, a rare moment of vulnerability creeping into her voice, “Keep an eye on her won’t you?” They swayed gently, their thorns glinting ominously in the dim light. </p><p>Rio rose to her feet, “Perhaps it’s time to learn more about you, Agatha,” she whispered to the garden, as if it could somehow provide insight into the enigma that was the woman who had come to share her home.</p><p>She passed back through the winding paths of the city, her mind racing with possibilities. On the day of their bargain, Agatha had mentioned the unknown being an opportunity. Perhaps their perspectives were aligned. What could she teach the witch that would make her useful for the months when she returned to the surface? There was a hunger for knowledge, for power. Over her coven perhaps? Rio hoped her vision wasn’t that limited. </p><p>Mortal squabbles were so uninteresting. Each and every one of them ended up here all the same. It wasn’t a fair fight. It was hardly a fight at all, she considered. But Agatha, she had challenged her. Her rapid heartbeat had given her away but all the same, she had snarked back at Rio in a way she hadn’t experienced <em>ever</em>. It wasn’t often that death got to live new experiences. It had been <em>fun. </em>Perhaps there was a way to nurture that.</p><p>She must be careful though. A spark of rebellion could rapidly spread into unruly flame. If Agatha had the drive, that Rio suspected she might, that would be enough to fuel her long enough for Rio to decide whether she would continue to prove interesting. </p><p>Limited contact, she decided. That would be important. She began contemplating how best to observe Agatha from a distance, to understand her without being ensnared in the chaos of her emotions. <em>I will not lose myself again,</em> she vowed silently. It would be a trial—not just of Agatha’s resilience, but of her own strength to resist the pull of something so intoxicating. With her mind made up, Rio took one last look at the darkening cityscape. </p><p>Though she wouldn’t engage directly, she still had work to do after all, she would observe, adapt, and prepare- for whatever this witch was to become. The dance between them had only just begun after all. Six months was a long time.</p><p>As she rematerialized at the gate that marked Cerberus’ territory, the air thickened with an ancient, primal energy. The great beast was a sight to behold—a mass of muscles and sinew, with three heads, each adorned with gleaming molten gold eyes. The central head bore a crown of jagged teeth, while the others were slightly smaller. They each carried their own personalities, the center head was fierce and unwavering, the second cunning and playful, while the third wise beyond mortal comprehension. It was a closely kept secret which was her favorite. But she definitely had one.</p><p>“Cerberus,” Rio called softly, her voice echoing in the stillness. “Come here, boy.”</p><p>The ground trembled slightly as Cerberus rose from his resting place, his massive frame stretching and yawning, revealing rows of sharp teeth. </p><p>As he approached, the three heads moved in unison, tongues lolling out in eager anticipation as a giant tail wagged, splintering a stalagmite into hundreds of shards. Rio’s fingers brushed against his coarse fur, the warmth of his breath misting against the chill of the Underworld. “You’ve been a very good guardian while I’ve been away, haven’t you darling?” she murmured, feeling the usual comfort of their bond. He understood darkness and solitude as well as she did.</p><p>Cerberus responded with a low growl, his heads tilting slightly as if sensing her distraction. The beast nuzzled a head on either side of her, seeking her attention.</p><p>Drawing a deep breath, Rio reached into her cloak and summoned a scroll, its edges shimmering. It unfurled before her, revealing the names of the recently arrived souls she had collected in the days since her departure. Her fingers traced the names, pausing as one caught her attention—a vile man, a murderer who took lives carelessly, not out of malice but out of a twisted sense of enjoyment. She remembered him. How <em>dare </em>he believe that he could wield <strong><em>Her</em></strong> power</p><p>The fury that perpetually simmered within her resurfaced. This man had disrupted her schedule, sending several souls here far before their time,  and now he would pay the price. “Cerberus,” she commanded, her voice taking on an edge, “find this one.” She pointed to the name on the scroll, the words almost burning against her fingertips. “Make him regret his existence.”</p><p>Cerberus’s growl deepened, a rumbling sound that echoed in the chamber, his three heads nodding in eager agreement. He loved a good chase, and his instincts kicked in at the command.</p><p>Without hesitation, the beast bolted forward, a blur of fur and teeth, disappearing into the shadows with a single-minded determination. Rio could hear the echoes of his footfalls, a thunderous cadence that made the ground tremble beneath her. She knew Cerberus would not stop until he had hunted the man down, toying with him as a cat might with a mouse before taking his time tearing the man apart. Of course, the soul would reform in a few days, but <em>if</em> he was lucky by then she’d have someone new to take her annoyance out on. There were always more scoundrels.</p><p>As the sounds of the chase faded, a familiar sense of satisfaction washed over her—a cruel joy in the execution of justice. But this time, it was tempered by her earlier encounter. A part of her wished she could share this moment with the young witch, to see the way she would respond to the raw power of Cerberus. Would she be in awe?</p><p>Standing alone in the cold, echoing depths, the thrill of punishment felt hollow. The joy she once derived from such acts was muted, overshadowed today. How annoying.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Rio started back toward her duties, the shadows of the Underworld welcoming her. She had souls to guide, energies to balance, and punishments to enforce—there was no time to dwell on a mortal who had stirred her interest. But as she moved through the winding paths, her thoughts remained tangled.</p><p>Reaching a particularly bustling district where the energy of the souls flowed like a river, she felt the familiar pulse of her realm. The factory machines clanked, and the air was thick with the scent of industry and carried the bitterness of mortal regret. Here, the souls labored under her watchful gaze, and she found a semblance of solace in the rhythm of their toil.</p><p>Yet, each soul’s weary expression reminded her of the young witch’s contrasting spirit upon arrival. That cheeky smirk. Petulant. She shook her head, trying to clear her thoughts as she approached a cluster of souls who had just arrived, fresh from the mortal world.</p><p>“Welcome,” she called, her voice carrying authority. “You’re dead. Sorry about your luck.”</p><p>A few of the souls cowered, groaning as they prostrated themselves. Pathetic.</p><p>“Why do you bother to moan? This place is inevitable. Don’t take it personally” she drawled, addressing no one in particular. “It only makes your time more painful.” </p><p>The souls shifted uneasily at her words, but she continued, “You cannot change what has been done. Accept it and move on. There is work to be done.” </p><p>Yet, as she spoke, she felt an unfamiliar twinge of frustration. Did human philosophy ever evolve? Was this still after centuries how they saw her? Just as cruel as the forces that had brought them to her? How simple of them. The thought festered, a nagging feeling she had long since buried. </p><p>She dismissed it, concentrating on the souls before her. The clever would operate machinery. The strong would haul coal and generate power. The obstinate would be sent to toil at the wall. It was an efficient system that she prided herself on.</p><p>When she had started here there was nothing. Not even ground or atmosphere, simply void. And now, she had built a full city, ever improving, just as alive as any up above. Full of little playthings to keep her entertained. Boredom had never suited her, and it certainly didn’t play out well for the overworld when she got restless. </p><p>Every soul in her dominion had a purpose. All serving the expansion of her kingdom. Building shaded replicas of whatever took her fancy during her visits up above. Mortals were quite innovative, accomplishing what they did when the majority of them had to do without magic. </p><p>An idea took root, a plan unfurling in her mind. If Agatha was to remain in her domain, she would need a role as well. </p><p>With renewed purpose, Rio summoned a tendril of magic, allowing it to flow from her fingertips and into the earth. As she worked, she felt a shift in the air, the darkness around her humming with power and intent. Perhaps this would keep her from feeling too entangled in the girl’s fate. Perhaps she could remain detached, merely the orchestrator of events, while Agatha navigated the path before her.</p><p>“I will keep you at a distance,” she vowed, her voice firm. “But I will not let you slip through my grasp.”</p><p>As she finished her enchantments, she stood and took one last look across the realm, her eyes lingering on a purple crystal window, now illuminated with a growing light from within. </p><p>In that moment, the chase had begun again—not for a soul to punish but for a spirit to grow.</p><p>Her ears perked as she heard sounds of a distant struggle, muted as if echoing underwater. Her lips curled into a grin. War was taking place somewhere above. Humans were so cyclical and predictable about these things. Like the clockwork that drove the machinery. She spared a parting glance at the window. It would be good for the girl to have time to settle in. </p><p>And it would be good for Rio to have something to keep herself preoccupied.</p><p>To battle, she disappeared.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>In the days following her arrival, Agatha found herself once again wrapped in a familiar blanket of isolation. This time it felt heavier though, as if the very air conspired to remind her of her place. She’d explored as much of the Underworld as she dared, taking in its jagged landscapes, towering shadows, and hollow-sounding corridors. Yet for all her efforts, she hadn’t once caught sight of Rio.</p><p>She filled her days with a growing restlessness, like a caged animal in a world so vast yet so closed off to her. Every morning, she woke to the strange, muted light that filtered through this realm, casting everything in shades of ashen gray. She attempted to explore the crumbling halls, the shadowed gardens, and the cavernous stretches of Rio’s city. But apart from the garden, she found very little to work with. Each exploration only served to sharpen her impatience and, worse, her confusion about why Rio had given her free reign if only to leave her adrift.</p><p>On the first day, she tried to find the patterns in the strange underworld flora, the alien flowers with sharp thorns and glowing edges that seemed to whisper when she passed. Their vines twisted around each other, almost like they were conspiring. The flowers felt watchful, but when she would pause to examine them more closely, they’d seem to shrink back, as if sensing her intrusion.</p><p>By the second day, she’d wandered into the heart of the city, a place of industry, where the air was thick with metallic dust and acrid smoke. Though her instincts warned her not to touch anything, she couldn’t help but reach out toward the machinery now and then, trying to feel if it pulsed with the same dark magic that thrummed in the city’s bones. But by her assessment, this was mechanical, not magical in nature. Souls moved like shadows through the place, toiling away, their eyes hollow and unseeing guarded by heavy goggles. Agatha felt something twist in her chest as she watched them, feeling like an intruder in this strange routine of endless labor.</p><p>“Who are you? Come here often? Whatcha working on?” She’d tried all manner of trying to engage with these shades but they gave her no responses. Occasionally one of them would raise their head slightly and she’d feel a wave of mournful grief rush through her body. But no other indication that she had even been heard.</p><p>Through all these interactions, even when meddling with her subjects, there was no sign of Rio. No cool, knowing gaze in the dark. No sharp laugh to cut through the silence. Not even the barest whisper of her voice. Just <em>nothing.</em></p><p>On the third day, her frustration reached a boiling point. She gazed at the mirror she had summoned, pulling her hair up and away from her eyes. Her thoughts churned as she stared at herself, seeing her own defiant, weary expression. Was this all just a game to Rio? A punishment for daring to challenge her? The endless waiting, the silence—this was a new kind of cruelty, one that she hadn’t prepared for.</p><p>“If you wanted to break my spirit,” she muttered aloud, voice swallowed by the oppressive quiet, “you could at least have the decency to face me while doing it.” Her own reflection glared back, a slight twist of bitterness in her eyes. If her words were heard by anyone else, they were not acknowledged.</p><p>It was later that day, when she found herself pacing along one of the garden paths, muttering half-formed spells just to have something to do, that she began to think she’d felt something. A familiar prickling, that sensation she’d felt when Rio was close. She stilled, gaze darting around. But there was nothing. Just the same empty, yawning silence.</p><p>The disappointment stung, and she felt her frustration slip closer to anger. She thought about calling Rio’s name. But she could already imagine how pathetic and desperate it would sound. Her voice echoing off the cold, stony walls of the garden, unanswered, swallowed by the looming shadows. No, she couldn’t have that. She wasn’t here to beg.</p><p>By the fourth day, she’d grown almost resigned to feeling like a guest forgotten in a house that didn’t care if she stayed or left. But there was still something defiant left in her. It simmered under her skin. She carried it like a curse, like a vow. She would not let Rio’s cold silence chip away at her resolve.</p><p>When she finally stumbled upon the dark cathedral, its monolithic structure looming high above, she felt an electric pull in her chest. For the first time, something in this realm called to her, a presence that didn’t just watch but beckoned. It was then that she knew—whatever this place held, it was finally offering her an invitation.</p><p>Agatha walked with purpose, squaring her shoulders as she approached. Maybe Rio would find her here, or maybe she wouldn’t. Either way, she was done waiting.</p><p>It was gothic in design <em>of course</em> but with no windows, just empty spaces between the walls. A dark wood door stood thirteen feet tall but as she approached she saw no discernable handle or knocker.</p><p>Rio had warned her about touching things she didn’t understand. But this place had called to her. Surely that wasn’t a mistake.</p><p>As she approached she noticed something out of place. A small splinter sticking out of the wood at a jagged right angle. Too obvious of a placement to be an accident.</p><p>She pressed her thumb to the splinter. Unsurprisingly it bit into her skin, sinking under the surface. Then the warm spring of blood, just a few drops, spilling against the door.</p><p>With a groan, the doors slowly swung inward. An invitation.</p><p>She crossed the threshold, her footfalls echoing as she walked over the transition from stone to dark marble. The interior of this place was similar to a cathedral but seemed neverending. A long cavernous mouth, illuminated by hundreds of candles lighting a path forward. </p><p>It was hard to get a sense of the scale of this place she realized. It reeked of illusion. And if it was an illusion, it meant it had to have been <em>crafted</em> with intention. Her steps echoed as she continued forward, that hook in her stomach drawing her in. She wasn’t entirely sure if her feet moved by her own will or if something greater had tethered her here. No matter, she was here all the same.</p><p>An echo sounded, louder than her footsteps as the doors closed behind her.</p><p>Eventually, her eyes focused on a spot where the floor grew more reflective. The flickering candlelight was dancing across a new surface of some kind. As she approached, she looked down and saw a dark reflection of herself looking back up at her.</p><p>Agatha gazed down, captivated by the reflection at her feet, the liquid shimmering almost completely black in the dim candlelight. The surface was smooth, unnaturally so. Its depth was impossible to gauge. She tentatively knelt next to the pool, and the slick, glistening surface seemed to ripple, tiny waves moving outward as if responding to her presence alone.</p><p>A coppery tang hit her nose—subtle at first, then sharper, filling her senses until it was undeniable. Her heart stilled as the realization sank in. This wasn’t water.</p><p>
<em> Blood. </em>
</p><p>The vast pool lay before her, an expanse of thick, crimson fluid, dense as oil. Its surface mirrored the cathedral’s arches and the looming shadows above, but the reflection was distorted, a dark echo that twisted the light and seemed to absorb it. The candles’ glow danced off the viscous surface, casting eerie streaks that gleamed like rubies.</p><p>A sense of weight settled over her, as she stared into the pool. At closer inspection, the blood’s surface broke in places, tiny bubbles rising and bursting, sighing and settling with each breath. She couldn’t tear her eyes away, drawn by both revulsion and fascination. Her reflection looked back at her, her eyes hollow and deep as the depths beneath her.</p><p>Agatha felt her pulse race, yet she didn’t move away. The call she had felt since entering now seemed to emanate from this pool itself. It was whispering something to her, though the words remained just beyond her grasp.</p><p>She considered the closest analog she had to this pool in front of her. A baptismal. Something people thought they could cleanse themselves in, and use as a vessel to become closer to the god they worshiped. </p><p>
<em> Communion. </em>
</p><p>The thought grew in her mind, unfurling. If this place was calling her, as Rio’s realm had seemed to from the moment of her arrival, perhaps it wasn’t just her place just to observe. Perhaps it was drawing her into a ritual, one that demanded her participation—demanded her surrender.</p><p>The pool’s surface held fast, a twisted baptismal font. Blood, rather than water, marked it as something not meant for absolution, but initiation. This wasn’t about cleansing away sins. This was a communion of power. And power <strong>wasn't</strong> a sin.</p><p>What if this was a well she could draw upon? Her hands tingled at the thought of it, her skin prickling with anticipation. This pool was calling her not as a guest, but as a participant, urging her to partake in a sacrament of flesh and blood. "So dramatic," she whispered.</p><p>She felt an urge rise in her, primal and raw. Beckoning, no, demanding her to dip her hands into the crimson depths, to feel this ancient reservoir seep into her skin. She could almost hear it—a soft hum, a murmur in the still air. It was as if the pool was promising her something—a connection, a link to something far older than her coven’s teachings, something that whispered of understanding and unclaimed energy.</p><p>Without breaking her gaze from the pool, she slipped off her shoes, her feet connecting with the cold, unyielding marble at its edge. A thrill shot through her—a recognition that she was on the verge of crossing into something <em>forbidden</em>. She inhaled deeply, steeling herself, the iron tang in the air filling her lungs.</p><p>Carefully, Agatha dipped the tips of her fingers just below the surface. The blood was ice cold but her face felt almost feverish. Tiny eddies formed where she touched, swirling outward, and she was mesmerized by the way her fingers emerged stained.</p><p>This would be her communion. She would let this realm claim her if only to see what it might reveal in return.</p><p>Rising from her crouched position, she dipped one foot into the pool, finding purchase on a step invisible underneath the thick surface. Her other foot followed. Another step down.</p><p>The pool was more frigid than she’d expected and she gasped as she descended deeper. As the pool lapped at her ribs and breasts, the cold ripped the breath from her lungs. But no revelations. No change in the air or space around her. No, she wasn't in deep enough yet. You couldn't reach only halfway for something <em>just</em> beyond your grasp.</p><p>Agatha grimaced again. The smell of iron was even more pungent and repulsive, she felt her stomach churn in response. No going back. If her lady had meant for her to find this place then surely she expected her to make something of it. She inhaled deeply, and then took a step forward, realizing simultaneously that the steps ended here, and there was nothing left awaiting but the embrace of the ritual. She submerged herself completely.</p><p>Below the surface she forced her eyes to open but could make out nothing in the murky space around her. Looking up she realized she couldn’t even see the flickering light from the surface above. Her heart began to speed up, panic and animal instinct beginning to take over.</p><p>It wasn’t lost on her that drowning had long been a <em>true</em> way to kill her kin.</p><p>As her dread grew she tried to force herself to swim back to the surface but her limbs were heavy and wouldn’t carry her. She swore and then cursed herself as she watched a few bubbles of precious air float away.</p><p>Fully panicking now she began to writhe, seeking her surroundings for anything to aid her. But there was nothing.</p><p>A thought sparked in her mind and then rooted itself in her stomach and heart with a cruel unflinching certainty. She had miscalculated. She was going to die here. In seeking power, instead, she’d found oblivion.</p><p>The last bit of air left her and she felt the thick oppressive liquid flow into her mouth, filling her throat and lungs. Stubbornly she kept her eyes open. For some reason, she thought of Rio at that moment. At the very least she knew that she’d be seeing a familiar face soon.</p><p>What would her reaction be? Would she be angry? Amused? Was Agatha the first, or just the most recent prey to fall into this snare?</p><p>Agatha finally closed her eyes and submitted to the void around her.</p><p>Quiet. Empty. Cold. Still.</p><hr/><p>“I thought witches bathing in the blood of virgins was an old wives tale?”</p><p>Her eyes sprung open.</p><p>Rio was sprawled haphazardly over a large throne, legs dangling carelessly over the arms as she spun a wicked curved knife between her hands. Completely nonchalant. Totally unsurprised to see Agatha here, covered in blood.</p><p>Agatha gasped and realized she could draw breath here. She was standing, no longer in the pool but somewhere else entirely. A comfortable room, an audience chamber perhaps based on the throne. She noticed she was actively dripping blood all over what was probably a beautiful and ornate rug.</p><p>“Blood of virgins?” She choked out, pushing away her thick matted hair and wiping the blood from her eyes the best she could. “Is that why it spit me out?”</p><p>Rio laughed, languidly leaning further back. “No,” she mused, sheathing the dagger and turning her head to grin wolfishly at Agatha. “It’s not that regressive.” She stood from the throne and stalked towards Agatha eyeing her curiously.</p><p>“Try again.” She challenged.</p><p>Agatha bristled a bit and spat, blood flying from her mouth and landing next to Rio’s boot. “Another lesson? Don’t go where I’m not invited? You here to reprimand me?”</p><p>Rio chuckled shaking her head. “Nope,” she said popping her lips around the word. “Next?”</p><p>“Well, you showed up.”</p><p>“You called me.” Rio said simply, taking another step closer. Two slender fingers passed down Agatha’s jaw, collecting the blood from her face.</p><p>Agatha flinched, her eyes darting to Rio’s hand.</p><p>“Well… I had to get your attention. You brought me here and then ignored me. For days I haven’t seen or heard from you. I thought we had agreed that I was brought here to learn from you.”</p><p>Rio smirked and raised an eyebrow. So lowly that Agatha had to strain to hear her, she seemed to draw out every word, “<em>you are here</em>, as my consort." </p><p>“By what definition?” </p><p>Rio’s hand froze mid-motion, her gaze narrowing slightly as if Agatha had just struck a nerve she hadn’t meant to expose. Then, in a whisper of amusement, her smirk returned, sly and shadowed. </p><p>“By my definition,” Rio replied, her fingers tracing back down Agatha’s jaw with a deliberate slowness.</p><p>Agatha felt a heat rise under her skin, not entirely from anger this time. She clenched her jaw and met Rio’s gaze, refusing to give her the satisfaction of a reaction. “So you drag me into that… that pool”—she grimaced, wiping more of the blood from her face and flinging it off her hand to the ground—"just to toy with me?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes glinted, and her voice dropped into a mockingly gentle tone. “Ah, so you thought you could just wander through my domain, plunge into its darkest depths, and come back unscathed?” She traced her bloodied fingers down Agatha’s collarbone, exposing pale slivers of skin as the blood smeared. “A consort doesn’t just watch from a distance, Agatha. You’re expected to understand the marrow of this place.”</p><p>“So… it was a test?” Agatha asked, the defiance in her voice tempered by an uneasy curiosity.</p><p>Rio hummed, her gaze lingering on Agatha. “An amuse-bouche if you will,” she replied, her voice rippling with humor. “The blood you were having your little spa day in? It’s the collective history of this realm. Souls come and go, but the essence—the raw emotions, the power, the failures and fears—that stays. Those who are worthy can draw upon it.” Her eyes gleamed, and she leaned in close to her ear. “And the unworthy ones? <em>They</em> drown.”</p><p>Agatha’s skin crawled, and she felt a strange pull in her chest at the thought. This was more than a simple game. There was power at work here, and Rio wielded it like a weapon. </p><p>“Suppose I… am worthy. What then?” she asked.</p><p>Rio’s smile was slow and sly, as if savoring Agatha’s defiance. “Then,” she said, “you’ll learn how to wield that power. But first, you have to prove yourself. Show me you won’t crumble under its weight.”</p><p>Agatha straightened, reaching up to wring some of the blood from her hair and wrinkling her nose as she felt it flow down her neck. She wasn’t sure if it was the warmth caused by Rio’s touch, or her own stubborn resolve, but something surged within her. “Fine. Then show me how to start.”</p><p>Rio’s laughter echoed softly through the chamber, low and dangerous. “Not here,” she purred, casting an appraising look at Agatha. “The real trials come soon enough. This is just the first taste.”</p><p>Her blood-stained fingertips drifted back up the column of her neck, over her jaw, to rest against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>Agatha had wondered before if she was feral. There was no absolutely no questioning that fact now. Her lips parted slightly, tongue flicking out, tasting the blood at the fingers offered to her.</p><p>“Delicious,” she growled, not recognizing her own low and hungry voice.</p><p>Rio grinned manically, fully baring her teeth as she gripped Agatha’s chin between her fingers.</p><p>“I was <strong><em>so</em> </strong>hoping you’d think so, sweetheart.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha had shared kisses before. Some early ones had even been sweet. Gentle promises, little whispers, “<em>Come closer—do you like that—can I touch you here</em>?” Others eager as her confidence grew, “<em>Just like that honey—let me feel you—you’re so good.</em>” She recalled hands woven in her hair, pinching at her breasts, slipping between her thighs. Her own hands, unfastening buttons, under skirts, over a mouth. </p><p>Not one of those dalliances could have prepared her. Not for the way she hungered, the way her whole body felt starved. She didn’t feel out of her body. She had never felt more alive than just now, her chin cradled in death’s hand.</p><p>She reached out, just as desperately as she had when she thought she was drowning. Grabbing at the back of Rio’s head she crashed into her. She kissed her. And as she did she felt something deeply buried purr with content.</p><p><em>This</em> what it was supposed to be like.</p><p>Other partners had always left her feeling like she hadn’t had her share. That she’d had to file off her sharper edges and darker wants in order to make herself palatable. To make herself not too dark, too needy, too greedy. They had wanted her to be more tame. They were women who had smiled too sweetly, their bodies were too soft, their sounds too delicate.</p><p>This was rough. Rio kissed her like she meant to consume her. Like this was how she would finally claim her soul, by ravaging her so completely that she no longer needed to draw breath. So that all she needed, was to continue having her lips, and tongue, and teeth upon her. </p><p>She tasted blood and didn’t know whether it was a leftover token from the pool or her own rising to the surface, Rio’s teeth had split her lip as she pulled away. The dark eyes that met hers were blown wide, Rio’s smile every bit that of some monster warned about in stories. The creatures that clawed, and tore with teeth and claws. That stole away little children who misbehaved. <em>Wicked</em> things.</p><p>Agatha again pursued her, crashing her body into Rio’s sending them stumbling back a couple of steps. But before she could kiss her again, a firm hand at her throat stopped her. She looked up at Rio, panting heavily, every bit the prey caught in a clever snare.</p><p>“You’ve got something,” Rio’s voice was low and raspy. “Just there.” </p><p>Agatha moaned, and was likely only kept standing by the strong hand at her neck, as Rio leaned in and licked the side of her face.</p><p>She grabbed desperately at Rio’s waist, pulling her body closer. Rio’s free arm wrapped around her, pulling just as eagerly as she pressed their foreheads together. Keen eyes studied hers as the hand at her throat pressed inward slightly.</p><p>“Wait.” Rio breathed, and Agatha could’ve cried. Waiting. She had spent a hundred years of her life waiting. Not just for power but to be seen. To be recognized. To wait a second longer would be crueler than to have never experienced this kind of desire. Before she could say as much—before she could give away how desperately she wanted her, how every lonely and unsatisfying moment felt like it had just been leading to this, before she could beg and bargain and deal— Rio continued, “I want to be clear. Despite what people think, I don’t take <em>anything</em> from them. Not until they’re ready.”</p><p>“I’m ready,” Agatha didn’t know if her words came out sincere, or a whine, or as a desperate plea. She didn’t care. She spoke with absolute certainty. Her mind, for all the chaos of her body, was perfectly clear. It just <em>wanted</em>. This seemed to be a good enough answer for Rio who studied her with clever eyes for just a moment longer before nodding. </p><p>The hand on her throat moved to her hair, wrapping in the long waves before pulling just on the edge of hard enough to be painful. Again her lips were captured, and her body was pulled with focus and intent. Rio spun them, and they stumbled together until the back of Agatha’s knees hit the throne and she collapsed into it.</p><p>Rio’s lips were insistent as she followed Agatha, crawling into her lap, straddling her. She grabbed Agatha’s face roughly, before running her hands down her arms, clutching her hands and pushing them to cling to the armrests. She kissed her again. Rio’s hips rolled against her lap as Agatha whimpered and struggled to kiss her hair, her temple, anything to make contact. Not content to stay in one place, Rio’s mouth moved to her ears, then neck. Kissing, biting, and sucking away the scarlet from her skin. Agatha’s skin was taking on a new shade of red as she flushed, gasping as Rio moved her mouth to her shoulder.</p><p>As Rio sank her teeth into her, Agatha groaned and drove her nails into her back. It was very likely that she’d marked Rio through her shirt with how hard she clawed at her. She wanted to see.</p><p>“I want to see you too.” Rio husked.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t realized she’d spoken out loud. </p><p>Rio leaned back, towering over her in this position and Agatha took the opportunity to rake her eyes over her. Rio was dressed differently than she had been before. No cloaks or dresses. Just a simple dark linen shirt, and pants that clung to her, stretched tight in her straddled position.</p><p>“Take it off.” Agatha’s smile quirked as she heard herself, her own steady words surprising her. Never had she imagined that <em> she </em>would be the person sitting on Death’s throne giving orders. Commanding death. Hm, a thought to tuck away for later.</p><p>Rio didn’t seem overly concerned with the balance of power Agatha was mentally weighing. She pulled her shirt off over her head, tossing it to some forgotten corner before grabbing Agatha’s hand and bringing it to the smooth plane of her stomach. </p><p>Agatha brushed her fingers over her ribs as she drew her hand higher. It grazed under the curve of a breast before she flattened it, splaying her fingers directly where Rio’s heart should be. She felt it. Rapidly beating just under her palm.</p><p>“You have a heart.” She breathed, unable to hide her surprise.</p><p>“It’s always a surprise to people.” Rio quipped, smiling in a nearly fond way. She leaned down and kissed Agatha again, in a way that was much more tender than any other they had shared, before sliding out of her lap and standing in front of her. “You look,” Rio paused, her tongue in her cheek, searching for the words.</p><p>Boldness sprung forward in Agatha. It was something else too. Many things. So many parts of herself that she had concealed and locked away at some point or another. The ugly, craven, wanting parts of her. Her shattered edges. Her eager thoughts. Every bit of her deemed “too much”. To tolerate? To handle? To love? Fuck that. She’d be <em>revered</em>. “How do I look?” She asked, sitting proudly on the throne for a moment.</p><p>Agatha held Rio’s gaze as she unbuttoned her shirt. Slowly revealing new fair skin that had escaped being completely blood-soaked and stained. She watched as Rio’s eyes shamelessly fell to her breasts. She watched her wet her lips.</p><p>“Tell me.” She challenged, shrugging her shirt away and standing as her hands moved to the belts around her skirts. “How do I look?” She smiled impishly as she pushed her remaining clothes to the floor. She stood completely exposed but had never felt more in control.</p><p>“You look,” Rio began again, shaking her head slightly “like nothing I’ve ever seen before.” She cupped Agatha’s jaw so gently, and Agatha was caught off guard by the tenderness. But just as quickly Rio found her bite again, shoving her firmly back down onto the throne.</p><p>Rio’s hands landed on Agatha’s thighs, nails slightly digging in, as she loomed over her, kissing her possessively. Crowding her space. Overwhelming her. Consuming. It took Agatha completely by surprise when the kiss was broken, and instead, she watched her gracefully drop to her knees in front of her.</p><p>“You look divine,” her lover continued, as she pressed a kiss to each knee before using her hands to slowly spread her legs apart. “You look—”</p><p>“Powerful?” Agatha gasped, her hands scrambling to find purchase on the arms of the throne. She still managed to lift her chin haughtily even as her hips betrayed her, twitching forward slightly. It was so subtle. Perhaps Rio hadn’t noticed. </p><p>“Formidable.” Rio husked, her eyes flicking from Agatha’s hips to her face.</p><p>She <em>had</em> noticed.</p><p>“Good.” Agatha gasped, urging her body to be still. She could feel a force greater than electricity, pure magic thrumming in the air around her. Time had come to a complete stop. She could feel every hair on her body, every beat of her thunderous heart, each movement of heat pooling throughout her. She held Rio’s gaze as long as she dared. Though she couldn't articulate it, she knew something important was being decided at this moment.</p><p>Rio looked up at her, waiting. They held eye contact, the air in the room heavy and oppressively hot. Both of them were breathless. Agatha felt a single bead of sweat roll down the dip of her neck. Rio broke first, smirking as she cracked her neck and winked up at Agatha. “That's right, Agatha. You’re so good,” she sighed before leaning down confidently.</p><p>Agatha’s proud composure didn’t last long. At the first brush of Rio’s tongue falling between her legs, Agatha screamed.</p><hr/><p>Echoes of cries faded as a heavy silence settled around them. Agatha sat, catching her breath, her mind still suspended between disbelief and a fierce, raw satisfaction. She felt sated. She felt for a moment like she could be still. Rio remained in front of her, sitting with her legs tucked under herself in front of the throne, her head resting against Agatha’s thigh with lazy ease. Her expression was unreadable as she traced idle patterns up and down her calf.</p><p>Many years from now, Agatha would recognize that these tracings were protective runes. A powerful old magic: when drawn in blood upon a protectant’s skin, the protectant would be shielded from any pain caused by the caster. They could only be broken by the caster or the protectant drawing blood against the other.</p><p>Agatha shifted slightly, her knee knocking against Rio's shoulder. She expected Rio to pull away—to break the fragile calm that had fallen between them—but instead, Rio turned her gaze to her, a softness in her eyes, a warmth that felt almost foreign in this dark, unyielding place. Agatha could feel the thrum of her pulse slow as she looked back, a flash of something both unnerving and magnetic. </p><p>She must be quite a sight like this. Legs still spread, lips bruised, thoroughly fucked, sitting a top of a throne. A beautiful woman beyond any reason kneeling at her feet. Dark lips still shining, wet with her. Agatha couldn’t help herself as she laughed, stretching an arm behind her head and shaking out her hair.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, a faint, mischievous smile playing at the corners of her mouth. “Well,” she drawled, her voice a low murmur that sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine, “that was fun.” </p><p>Agatha scoffed lightly, but she could feel a blush heat her cheeks. She looked away, unwilling to let Rio see just how much of her composure had slipped. She didn’t trust her voice to speak yet. And she definitely didn’t trust her legs to stand. She didn't know when her hand had tangled in Rio's hair but she used this moment to lightly scratch her scalp. She felt Rio's soft hum against her skin.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment. She took stock of her body, heavy and sluggish, a few sharp points of pain lingering. She imagined a few spots would color into bruises in the day to come. They would be a reminder at least. Something for if Rio decided to disappear again. Something to prove this handn't been another wicked dream of hers.</p><p>Agatha frowned at the memory of what had drawn her here in the first place. “Oh. I get it…” she spoke softly her voice growing venomous. She could feel Rio’s head lift up to look at her better. “'That was fun,'” she repeated mockingly, "I put out and suddenly I’m worth your time. You bring me here then leave for days. You don't say anything that isn't cryptic as shit. Then you fuck me, what just because you could? Is that the game you play?” She hated these thoughts, poisoning this moment. But as her anxiety crept up, she knew that she was right. This was the moment. It always happened. This was when the joke was revealed and she'd find out she'd been had. She <em>was</em> foolish.</p><p>“Hey.” Rio pinched her thigh, breaking her thoughts and drawing Agatha’s eyes back to her.</p><p>“Stop that,” she continued, shifting up to both knees to look up closer at Agatha. Rio’s gaze held steady, her eyes darkened with something serious. She rested her hand on Agatha’s thigh, gentle but firm, grounding them both as she spoke.</p><p>“Look, Agatha,” she began, her voice calm but no-nonsense, “my work—this place—is only half of what I do.” Her thumb traced a slow line over Agatha’s skin, as though measuring her words. “The only chance I have to leave here, to walk on the surface, is when there’s… a reason. Something big enough to pull me out of the shadows.”</p><p>Agatha felt her heart flip strangely as Rio continued. “There’s a war up there,” she said bluntly, each word sharp. “A lot of people dying. I’m not going to pretend I can pick and choose who goes and when. Sometimes my work is… chaotic. It takes up a lot of time.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught as she saw a shade of vulnerability flicker in Rio’s eyes. It was gone as quickly as it came, replaced by that guarded expression again. “This job,” Rio went on, her tone softening though her words held new weight, “it doesn’t leave room for… I don’t know, for promises. For explanations. I go when I’m called. And lately, I’ve been needed constantly.”</p><p>The faintest touch of bitterness undercut her words. “It wasn’t about punishing you, Agatha, or making you wait. Even I sometimes have to do things I don’t want to. For the record, this,” her gaze wandered over Agatha's body "I absolutely wanted but never expected of you. This wasn't part of our deal. This was just... personal."</p><p>Agatha looked down, grappling with the strange mixture of emotions Rio’s words had stirred up. Rio let the silence settle between them before speaking again, more quietly, almost as if confessing something.</p><p>“I’m used to doing this alone.” She met Agatha’s gaze. “I didn’t think about you waiting because… I’ve never had to.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her resentment softening. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to—”</p><p>“Nuh uh!” Rio interrupted, hopping to her feet with incredible speed and pressing a finger over her lips. “Never apologize for doing what you want. Or for saying what's on your mind.” She leaned down and Agatha thought she was about to kiss her cheek but instead, Rio snapped her teeth at her playfully. “Never!” Rio nearly cackled before pausing. “You’ve still got something, just there,” she teased, flicking her finger against Agatha’s lip before bending down to pick up her shirt and pulling it over her head.</p><p>Agatha couldn't help but laugh before catching Rio’s hand with her own. “Wait,” she said softly. She had seen something familiar a moment ago, a flash of something she was a master of herself. Deflection. There had been a moment, just now, when the lines near Rio’s eyes had softened, her lip had nearly trembled. She had been quick to cover it with the puckish character she seemed to love to play but Agatha had seen it. Rio had been maskless for just a moment. Why had she hurried away from it?</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow curiously at her. “Yes?”</p><p>Agatha chewed her lip for a moment, even her deepest insecurities didn't claim she was a selfish lover. “What about you? Don’t you want me?” She winced. Now she was the one being overly exposed. She affected a playful lilt to her voice “I mean, when death comes a—”</p><p>“Nope. No death comes such and such, little death, or any other death adjacent orgasm jokes you’re thinking of.” Rio drolled with an eye roll. “I promise you I’ve heard them all.” She held a serious expression for only a second before smiling at Agatha and lifting her hand to her lips. She placed a gentle kiss to her knuckles, her lips brushing away the last flakes of dried blood.</p><p>“Another time,” Rio said, sounding genuinely remorseful as she dropped Agatha’s hand. “Trust me, I have so much more I want to see of you. But unfortunately, the idiots up there can’t stop killing each other long enough for me to take a personal day.” Rio rolled her eyes again playfully. “But. This time, I’m telling you I’m leaving. And when I’m back you’ll be the first to know.”</p><p>She took a few steps back away from Agatha, swaying playfully as she clasped her hands in front of her. “Back soon! Stay in trouble!” Rio called.</p><p>“Wait, isn’t it 'stay out of trouble?'”</p><p>Rio threw a wink over her shoulder as she turned away.</p><p>“Te veo.”</p><p>Agatha should’ve been truly pissed off by Rio’s disappearing act, leaving her naked, covered in blood— blood wholly unrelated to her being fucked within an inch of her life she might add— and alone again. But she wasn’t. Because while Rio had left in a rush, she wasn’t that cold.</p><p>As Rio had disappeared, Agatha opened her eyes to find herself back in her own room. A heavy woven shawl, a purple and black weave, had been draped over her. In a previously empty corner of the room, a large metal tub was filled with water, and the smell of gentle oils mixed with the steam in the air. Next to the tub, a small bud vase held a single Shadebloom. Agatha almost scoffed but she couldn’t help the genuine smile that crept across her face. She stepped into the tub, moaning softly as the warm water enveloped her, and hissing as it stung some of the harder bites Rio had left behind. The caress followed by the slap. It seemed to be a common theme.</p><p>She sank lower in the tub and cleaned herself, noticing that the water never seemed to grow cold. It was a thoughtful gesture. She’d almost call it romantic if she weren’t a cynic.</p><p>As she stretched in the tub she replayed every beat of the memory of their encounter. She caught herself tracing her fingers over her lips, pressing into the small cut Rio had left behind.</p><p>The underworld turned out to have many things she wanted. Things she needed. And there was plenty of time ahead for her to sink her teeth into it all.</p><p>Agatha smiled and leaned back into the tub, letting herself relax for the first time in over a century.</p>

<p>At the pool again, Agatha smiled, curling the fingers of her left hand, she watched in fascination. A thread of blood, a narrow stream, lifted from the surface. It rose into the air, coiling around her fingers without staining them.</p><p>“Hello. Who are you?” She spoke softly, not wanting to disturb the transaction. Not wanting to spook herself and lose her nerve.</p><p>Since her first initiation to this ritual, she had been spending more time trying to crack the puzzle of the magic contained here. Rio had indicated that the pool was a collection of memories, unfinished business, and untapped potential. In Agatha’s early experiments, she had learned that if she focused her mind, attuned to the whispers here, and listened, she could draw her attention to the frequencies that reverberated the loudest.</p><p>So far, it had forced her to reckon with and carry a series of griefs that were not her own. The grief of a parent was the loudest. There was an explicit and awful pain attached to those who had outlived a child. She felt genuine pity, and quickly returned their strings to the pool. Next most potent was the energy of those who had lost their lovers. Through death, or neglect, or missed opportunity. The pain echoed all the same. She quickly discarded these threads. There was no helping, or anything to gain from, them either.</p><p>Several times she wondered if Rio felt and carried each of the legacies at the time of a souls passing. Feeling this amount of emotion was draining. Over a few visits she tuned her senses. She narrowed in on the feelings of frustration. The souls whose last thoughts were, “I still had so much to do.”</p><p>Agatha felt confident this kind of lost energy was what she held between her fingers now. But how to channel it? That she hadn’t figured out. Yet.</p><p>The door to the chamber creaked open and though she heard no footsteps, she could feel Rio’s eyes on her.</p><p>“In the middle of something,” she called out, not sure how close Rio was.</p><p>A murmur directly next to her ear answered that. “I see that.” A hand came to Agatha’s elbow, lifting it slightly, gently correcting her form. “What did you find?”</p><p>“A poet of some kind. I think. It’s hard to explain, he feels musical?”</p><p>Romantic,” Rio drawled.</p><p>“Foolish.”</p><p>Her form now corrected, she felt Rio’s hand move to rest lightly at her waist. Not trying to distract her. Just a grounding touch.</p><p>Regardless of Rio’s intent, Agatha could feel her focus slipping.</p><p>“Are you here to help me?” she asked. </p><p>“That depends on you, Agatha. “Are you <em>asking</em>?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, caught between annoyance, affection, and the knowledge that she could only hold this enchantment a few more minutes before the spell was lost. “Fine. I’m asking.” She admitted.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio’s other hand moved to Agatha’s waist also, holding her like a partner in this dance but still not leading her. “So, you’re asking. Are you asking because you actually need my help? Or do you just want my help?” Rio teased slyly, squeezing Agatha’s hips slightly.</p><p>Agatha growled in frustration, closing her hand into a fist to discard the spell. But as she attempted to toss the remnants of the spell away, she felt a sharp shock in her fingertips. She glanced at her hand and saw where once blood had been conjured there was now a faintly glowing swirl of purple magic.</p><p>Cautiously, she raised her hand to eye level. The orb seemed to emit a faint ethereal melody, meandering plucking on a harp. Wistful. She watched the orb entranced as the tune and spark slowly faded.</p><p>“Just wanted my help then,” Rio spoke softly, breaking Agatha’s trance.</p><p>Agatha turned to face her, annoyance forgotten as she smiled genuinely. “I’m closer now. Right?”</p><p>Rio gave a noncommittal shrug. “Beats me. I’m just the cleanup crew.”</p><p>Agatha flushed a bit, remembering their previous encounter charged by this place. “I don’t believe that for a second.”</p><p>Rio winked at her before gently brushing a curl that had fallen from where Agatha had drawn her hair up.</p><p>“So,” Rio spoke, “are you still working?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, she was pleased with what she’d accomplished. The satisfaction of unlocking this puzzle had filled her, but it had also opened up another itch. “That depends…” she began, teasing. “Are you asking me because you want me to be done working or do you<em> need </em>— “</p><p>She was cut off as Rio visibly bristled, “I will <em> never </em> ask you to stop working for what you want.”</p><p>But Agatha was undeterred, taking Rio’s arm as if by placing a hand on her she could keep her from disappearing. “I’m not. I’m working to get what I want right now,” she said boldly, rubbing Rio’s wrist gently with her thumb.</p><p>Agatha observed as Rio studied her. Her expression was hard to read but Agatha felt as if she was being scrutinized, sized up. In every moment they’d shared, she’d noticed that there were two versions of the woman who enchanted her. Death who was powerful and claiming, and someone else who was far more prey-like in their instinct, quick to cut and run. She didn’t want to spook the woman again. Not when she had just returned. Not when Agatha longed for more than a few moments of company.</p><p>This was a new feeling. Solitude hadn’t truly bothered her before. It had been annoying, a nuisance. But that was because her isolation in the coven had been intentional, she had been kept from something. It had been purposeful. This felt different. Like there was a force, gravity, careening them into one another’s orbit for a cosmic moment just to pull them apart before they could become aligned. Surely that pull wasn’t just something she had felt. Otherwise how could she explain their tryst in the throne room? Agatha swallowed, her stomach heavy with the realization that she wanted something else, something deeper and more dangerous. </p><p>Before she could deny herself through a joke, before Rio could slip her hand from her grasp, she breathed, “I just… we don’t have to— I just want to spend time with you.”</p><p>Rio's eye’s darted over her face, seemingly looking for any micro expression, any clue of something else that hung in the air unspoken. Finding nothing, she nodded, slipping her wrist from Agatha’s grasp. Gently shifting it to take Agatha’s hand in her own. “Today was— I’m not entirely here yet.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Well, I’m glad you’re on your way.” She smiled slightly before looping her arm in Rio’s. “Let’s walk. I want to show you what else I’ve been working on.”</p><p>As she steered them on the path towards the garden, Agatha could feel Rio’s usual confidence slowly returning, the guarded tension melting into something that felt lighter, if only a little. It was a rare softness she wasn’t used to seeing yet, and the moment felt strangely delicate.</p><p>“So,” Agatha said, nudging her shoulder into Rio’s. “Are you going to tell me about this day of yours or are you just hoping I’ll assume you were doing something dangerous and daring my Queen.” Teasing, but sharply curious at the same time.</p><p>Rio gave her a sidelong look, a flicker of her usual mischief creeping back. “Are you sure you want to know? I could give you the sanitized version, but that would be… misleading.”</p><p>“Spare me nothing,” Agatha replied with a smirk, clearly invested. She was no stranger to a bit of darkness.</p><p>“Alright, then,” Rio shrugged. “It’s war, Agatha. Famine. Plagues. If there’s a place where death gets a little crowded, I have to make an appearance.” She let her words hang in the air, casting a casual gaze towards her. “You might say it’s an escape, the only way I still walk the surface. But it’s not pleasant work. Not something I’d expect you to understand. It’s relentless.”</p><p>“And yet you keep at it,” Agatha replied, softer now.</p><p>Rio huffed, her usual confidence softening just a fraction. “It’s the job, Agatha. I don’t get the luxury of deciding if it’s fair or easy.” Then, she glanced at Agatha, her eyes glinting with a return of her spirit. “But if you’re accusing me of shirking responsibility here to come back to you… Well, perhaps I’ll admit a bit of that.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow, genuinely surprised. </p><p>Rio laughed, and the stiffness finally faded from her shoulders. “Don’t let it go to your head.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, though she couldn’t suppress a smirk. “So you went up there, threw a little fear around, and came back exhausted?”</p><p>“Some days that’s all it takes. Today, though…” Rio hesitated, and for a moment, Agatha saw a flicker of something more serious in her expression. But then Rio shrugged, brushing it off with a dismissive wave. “It was a lot of, well, <em> people </em>—the living ones can be messy.”</p><p>“Messy?” Agatha echoed, raising an eyebrow. “You say that like it bothers you.”</p><p>“Only when it gets in my way,” Rio replied with a shrug. “Besides, unlike certain people I know, I’m not afraid to get my hands a little dirty.”</p><p>“Only a little?” Agatha teased, letting a mischievous edge into her voice.</p><p>Rio shot her a sidelong glance, a grin tugging at her mouth. “Careful,” she warned, her tone playful but carrying a hint of that familiar, sharp edge. “I’m not in the habit of giving demonstrations.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, amused. “You don’t need to prove anything to me,” she replied. “I already know what you’re capable of.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio said, quirking an eyebrow. “Is that so? Because I seem to recall someone was awfully eager to ‘work for what she wants’ not too long ago.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, genuinely this time, feeling the tension that had lingered between them dissolve. As they continued down the path, Rio’s steps seemed lighter, and her posture, usually so poised and calculated, grew more relaxed, her usual spark creeping back.</p><p>Eventually, they stepped into the garden bathed in muted, silvery light that seemed to come from nowhere in particular. The air was fragrant, carrying hints of night-blooming flowers, and the soft rustle of leaves stirred a tranquility that felt entirely foreign to the shadows of the city.</p><p>Agatha had been at work here when not pursuing the pool’s magic. She wasn’t sure how or why, but each time she visited there seemed to be a couple new blooms. One was beginning to grow tall, a few feet high. Some sort of tree, a sapling, far from bearing fruit but breaking proudly out of the ground.</p><p>Rio released Agatha’s hand and walked ahead, lowering herself onto a weathered stone bench nestled between two flowering vines that were new as well. She looked almost out of place here, her usual sharpness softened by the delicate surroundings. With a casual gesture, she patted the spot beside her.</p><p>“Sit,” she said, and though her tone was light, there was something almost cautious in her expression.</p><p>Agatha joined her, the bench cool under her touch. They sat in silence for a moment, watching the strange blooms sway under an invisible breeze.</p><p>“You know,” Agatha began, her voice quiet, “I didn’t expect this place to have… a garden. You don’t exactly strike me as the type to spend time around flowers.”</p><p>Rio snorted, stretching her arms along the back of the bench. “That’s because I don’t,” she replied, though her eyes softened slightly as she looked around. “But it’s quiet here, even if it doesn’t quite fit. I suppose it’s… grounding. I think I’ve earned a bit of quiet after the last couple days. Death is persistent. Haven’t you heard?”</p><p>Agatha settled beside her, feeling the weight of Rio’s honesty but sensed a rare peace in her. She wasn’t going to break it. She let the quiet stretch, a comfortable silence, as they both watched the play of light on the leaves. It was rare, this stillness, and as they sat side by side, it was as if neither dared disturb it. Finally, Rio spoke, her voice low. “For what it’s worth, I do plan to be around more. It’s,” she paused for a long moment as Agatha for once in her life was patient “nice to be around someone who isn’t afraid.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and considered her words. Rio was right. She felt many things about the woman next to her, but even at the time of their bargain, of her taking, she hadn’t been afraid.</p><p>She chanced a glance at Rio who kept her eyes locked forward as if suddenly deeply interested in the plants she claimed not to care for. “Yeah,” she said gently, “I get that.” </p><p>She placed her hand on top of Rio’s, content to sit in the stillness with her. This was also new. This peaceful feeling. This calm. Agatha was scared to break it. She said nothing else, but gently hummed the poet’s tune from before. If there had been birds here perhaps one would have picked up the tune. But she was the only living thing here.</p><p>“So,” Rio said after a moment, glancing at Agatha with that mischievous gleam back in her eye, “are you going to tell me what you are <em> really </em> trying to do at that pool?”</p><p>Agatha grinned, feeling a surge of boldness. “Only if you admit you were spying on me.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, but her smirk widened. “Maybe I was,” she replied smoothly. “Or maybe I was just making sure you weren’t getting yourself into trouble you couldn’t handle.”</p><p>“Hmm. So you do care,” Agatha teased, nudging Rio with her elbow.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warned, though her tone held no real threat. She leaned in close, her face inches from Agatha’s, her voice dropping to a low murmur. “I’ll let you in on a secret: sometimes, I enjoy the trouble.”</p><p>Agatha felt her pulse quicken, a warmth spreading through her as Rio’s gaze held hers. For a moment, it felt as if the rest of the world—the shadows, the wars, even the dark magic that bound this place together—had faded, leaving only the two of them in this quiet, almost surreal sanctuary.</p><p>Agatha allowed herself a small smile, one that was both an answer and a promise. “I know.”</p><p>She leaned closer, brushing her nose against Rio’s cheek, allowing her— perhaps allowing them both—a moment to pull back. Neither did. Taking the plunge into death’s embrace, she kissed her.</p><p>It was soft this time. Like the first leaves to fall in autumn. Like the way the black of night glowed slightly just before dawn. They both sighed into it. There were no desperate hands or biting teeth. Just a final brush of cool lips against hers.</p><p>“Don’t go far from me,” Agatha whispered, her voice small.</p><p>“I wouldn’t dream of it.”</p><p>They kissed again, and as they did — though they were too caught up in the moment they shared to notice— flowers bloomed, haloing the bench around them.</p><p>"None of this used to be here," Rio murmured, fingers brushing a newly-bloomed vine beside her. "Before you were— before.”</p><p>Agatha looked around at the plants. The magic of the earth wasn’t hers, she hadn't intended to bring anything here; she’d simply practiced with what little magic she'd been able to draw from her surroundings, shaping its energies. But something in this garden had responded in turn, as if her magic had become a bridge to somewhere outside of death's domain.</p><p>“I just thought I’d try…to make it grow,” Agatha said, almost sheepishly. "I don’t really know why it’s working, or how. But I think maybe…these plants are connecting to me.” She looked at Rio, suddenly worried. “If it bothers you, I can stop. But...it feels different, like this place is responding to me.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened as she looked at Agatha. She took Agatha’s hand, tracing patterns absentmindedly with her thumb. “Don’t stop. I told you the garden was yours to tend to. You’re changing things here, that much is clear.”</p><p>Agatha felt a warmth in Rio’s touch, and before she could think twice, she squeezed her hand and asked, “Come to bed with me tonight. Just stay close for a while.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow, her lips curving in a wry smile. “I don’t sleep, remember?”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha replied, her voice soft. “But… I just want you nearby.”</p><p>Rio studied her for a moment, as if trying to read her intentions, then gave a slight nod. “Fine. I’ll stay as long as you need.”</p><p>Together, they walked back through the hallways of the dark fortress, Rio silent and watchful by her side. The rooms felt less oppressive with Rio there, her silent presence a balm to the shadows and her steps the only echo beside Agatha’s. When they reached Agatha’s chambers, she removed her outer clothes and climbed into bed, settling against the cool, crisp sheets. Rio sank beside her, not touching her but close enough she could feel her weight on the bed, quiet, her gaze roaming over the dark room.</p><p>As the night wore on, Agatha felt herself drifting off, the warmth of Rio’s hand still lingering in her memory. Her last glimpse was of Rio, still and watchful as ever, her gaze cast out towards the window where a faint, silvery light filtered through.</p><p>In the middle of the night, she felt an arm tentatively wrap around her waist. Half asleep she tried to roll towards the touch, but the arm tightened, holding her close. Holding her in place. Agatha mumbled in her sleep and nestled back against the body pressed against her. As she drifted back to sleep she swore she heard a low pleased hum against her hair.</p><p>In the morning, Agatha awoke, stretching as the last remnants of sleep faded. Her room was quiet, but her heart sank a little as she noticed she was alone. She thought for a moment she’d dreamed it all—Rio's warmth, her quiet presence by her side. But then, her eyes fell on the pillow next to her, where a single flower lay.</p><p>She recognized it immediately, a symbol of memory, something left in places of significance, a token of promise.</p><p>She held it in her hand, letting her fingers trace the delicate petals. A faint smile tugged at her lips, despite the solitude of the moment. Even if Rio wasn’t there in person, the bloom meant she hadn’t truly left.</p><p>Just then, a soft breeze stirred through the room, carrying with it the faintest whisper of Rio’s chuckle, though Agatha couldn’t tell if it was her imagination or something more. It felt like a promise, a gentle reminder that Rio hadn’t gone as far as the shadows suggested.</p><p>And perhaps, in some ways, she hadn’t left at all.</p>

<p>The days began to blur together as Agatha and Rio fell into their quiet rhythm—a wordless understanding that carried them from one day to the next. The tension that hung between them, though subtle, was unmistakable; Agatha could feel it in the way Rio’s eyes lingered on her sometimes, and in her own racing heartbeat whenever Rio was near. It was like standing on the edge of something vast and unknown. </p><p>The mysteries of the underworld were <em>not</em> the most interesting secrets here. All the same, when Rio was away, the call of the magic buried in that awful bloody pool beckoned her.</p><p>Agatha kneeled now, beside the pool, the dark surface reflecting an image of herself. She pressed her fingers to the surface, focusing her intent, letting the quiet stillness of the cathedral fall away until all that was left was the pool’s unyielding depth. Just as she began to pull her awareness inward, a sudden image flared into her mind, vivid and unsettling.</p><p>The lush, vibrant garden she’d come to adore was withered and gray, the foliage brittle and lifeless. Shadeblooms, which usually glowed faintly, now lay scattered in strange, chaotic patterns, dotting the floor with dark, shriveled petals.</p><p>The silence was oppressive. She couldn’t feel Rio’s presence, a hollow ache settling in her chest as she reached out, but her hand only brushed cold air. She focused her mind and a new image formed. The throne was vacant, its form barely visible in the dim, unnatural darkness that seemed to swallow every inch of the room. Agatha stumbled forward, the weight of what she saw pressing in on her until—</p><p>The vision shattered, the pool rippling under her fingertips as she gasped, her breath ragged.</p><p>A moment later, she sensed Rio’s presence beside her, solid and steady. Agatha turned to face her, still reeling, her heart racing as the images from the vision lingered like ghostly afterimages in her mind.</p><p>Rio’s face softened, concern flickering in her eyes. “What did you see?” she asked, voice soft but edged with a faint tension.</p><p>“I… I saw the throne room. Empty. And everything was… wrong,” Agatha whispered, unable to shake the strange weight that had settled over her. She forced herself to meet Rio’s gaze. “It felt like something was missing.”</p><p>Rio’s expression didn’t change, though Agatha saw something flicker in her eyes—an understanding, perhaps, or something deeper. But as quickly as it came, it was gone, replaced by her familiar, composed mask.</p><p>“That was only a vision,” Rio said evenly, but Agatha could feel the slight hesitation in her words. “Magic can reveal many things, not all of them real. Sometimes we see what we want.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, yet the vision continued to gnaw at her, an insidious doubt creeping into her thoughts. She needed answers, something more than Rio’s quiet reassurances. She wanted Rio to tell her what the vision meant, to let her in on the mysteries that seemed to keep them separated.</p><p>“Is there something you’re not telling me?” Agatha pressed voice barely a whisper. “Something about… about all of this?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes met hers, steady and unflinching, but instead of answering, she turned her gaze back to the pool, her silence like a heavy curtain drawn between them. The distance Agatha had felt earlier seemed to swell, taking root in that single unanswered question, the quiet between them fraught with an unspoken truth that Rio refused to share.</p><p>After a moment, Rio stood, her hand hovering over Agatha’s shoulder for a fleeting second, as though she wanted to say something more but couldn’t find the words. And then she was gone, leaving Agatha by the pool, her heart caught in a place between wonder and fear.</p><p>Agatha growled in frustration. She would not be deterred. If Rio wouldn’t give her answers, she would take them.</p><p>Determined, Agatha returned her focus to the pool's shimmering depths, her mind racing. The whisper of possibilities beckoned her, promising secrets she had yet to uncover. She needed to know the full extent of her power, to command it and prove that she was more than just a visitor in this realm—she was a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>At the edge again, the familiar sense of trepidation coursed through her veins, but she quickly silenced it. She had faced dark things before, and had embraced the unknown. This time would be no different.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Agatha focused on the surface, allowing her fingertips to skim the pool’s edge. She felt the energy thrumming beneath her skin, a familiar pulse that sang to her instincts. Closing her eyes, she began to chant softly, weaving words of summoning that were unfamiliar but seemed to spring forth from her very bones. The incantation hung in the air, charged with a sense of urgency and ambition.</p><p>The blood began to swirl, its surface rippling like a restless sea, the deep burgundy and crimson blurring into a chaotic dance. Agatha felt exhilarated; she was touching the very fabric of magic itself. She pushed deeper into her thoughts, envisioning something to summon, perhaps a guiding spirit, someone who could provide the insight that Rio had denied.</p><p>But as the incantation built, so too did the power, swirling wildly around her. Agatha’s focus began to waver, the chaotic energy spinning out of her control. Tendrils of magic lashed out, wrapping around her, pulling her toward the dark edge of the veil—the thin barrier between the living world and something beyond the boundaries of the realm she found herself in now.</p><p>As she was drawn closer to the void, the world around her began to distort. She could see it now—a swirling darkness, a vast expanse of emptiness, where the echoes of lost souls lingered like distant whispers. The shadows writhed like smoke, swirling and coiling around her, their shapes shifting and pulsating with an eerie life of their own.</p><p>Agatha's heart raced as she realized she was teetering on the brink of something far more dangerous than she had anticipated. Panic surged through her as she felt herself being pulled into the void, shadows encroaching from every side, their wispy forms clawing at her, trying to drag her into their depths. The air felt thick and heavy, filled with the muffled cries of those who had been lost—specters of despair and longing that echoed in the recesses of her mind.</p><p>“Agatha!” </p><p>The commanding voice cut through the chaos like a beacon. Rio’s presence ignited a flame of recognition, grounding her in the midst of the spiraling shadows. Agatha felt the grip of the darkness falter as Rio rushed forward, her expression a blend of fury and fear.</p><p>“What have you done?” </p><p>Agatha gasped, fighting against the tide of energy that threatened to drag her further away. “I— I was just trying to see! I thought I could control it!”</p><p>“Control it?” Rio’s voice rose, sharp and slicing through the panic. “You’re playing with forces you don’t understand! This is not a game, Agatha. You could have been lost here permanently!”</p><p>With a swift motion, Rio extended her hand toward Agatha, channeling her own magic to counteract the swirling chaos. Agatha felt the familiar warmth of Rio’s power envelop her, anchoring her to the present, and pulling her back from the precipice of despair.</p><p>The shadows writhed in defiance, and Agatha could almost hear their lament, the cries of the forsaken who lingered at the edge of existence. They were not willing to lose their prize. The darkness felt alive, an ever-hungry void yearning to consume, and for a fleeting moment, she understood the fragility of her own life.</p><p>Just as the shadows began to close in again, Rio’s magic surged, a brilliant flash of green light that pierced through the gloom. Agatha felt the shadows retreat, their whispers fading into nothingness. She found herself collapsing back onto solid marble, breathless and trembling.</p><p>As she looked up at Rio, who knelt beside her, the intensity lingered in the air like static. “Do you understand the danger you were in?” Rio’s voice was fierce.</p><p>“I… I didn’t mean to—” Agatha stammered, shame flooding through her. “I thought… I thought it could bring me closer to—”</p><p>Rio shook her head, her anger palpable. “You must respect boundaries, Agatha. Otherwise, you risk losing everything.”</p><p>The silence stretched between them, heavy with the gravity of what had just happened. Agatha looked away, ashamed. “I didn’t think…”</p><p>“I know,” Rio interrupted, her voice softer now. “But that is why I’m here—to help you navigate this place. You must trust me, Agatha, as I trust you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her heart aching with the reality of her actions.</p><p>“I will,” she promised, a newfound resolve settling within her. “I’ll be more careful. I don’t want to lose...” She trailed off not quite knowing how to finish that thought.</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, the tension in her shoulders easing slightly as she met Agatha’s gaze. “Then listen to me. There is much you can learn, but it requires patience and respect for the magic we’re dealing with.”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><hr/><p>That evening, as the glow of twilight settled across the garden, Agatha found herself watching Rio from across a fountain that she had conjured here a few days ago. She was arranging a few of the luminous Shadeblooms, their soft glow casting her face in ethereal light, and Agatha felt the familiar pull, an ache she didn’t quite understand but had long since stopped resisting. She walked over to where Rio stood, her footsteps soft against the stone, and reached out to place a hand on Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>Rio glanced at her, something else beyond her earlier frustration in her gaze tonight—something heavier, as if she, too, could feel the unspoken words weighing down the silence.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened slightly on Rio’s shoulder, grounding herself. “I know you’re still mad about the pool. I just… I want to understand it better. I feel close to unlocking something. But I feel like I’m not going to have enough time. Have you… ever thought about it?” she asked softly, her voice barely more than a whisper. “What it might be like if I just… stayed?”</p><p>Rio’s expression didn’t change, but her hand stilled over the flowers, her gaze fixed on something distant. For a long moment, she didn’t speak, and Agatha felt a pang of fear that she had gone too far, that she’d shattered the delicate balance they had managed to build.</p><p>But then Rio turned to face her, and her eyes softened, though there was still that impenetrable shadow in them. “It’s not as if I don’t think about it,” she murmured, her voice low and even. “But… you belong to a world that’s bigger than this. One that can give you more than I can here. Remember what you came here for? Don’t get distracted.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart twisted at the words, an ache that settled into her bones. She took a step closer, reaching out to gently touch Rio’s face as if she could somehow make her understand the depth of her feelings through that one simple gesture. “What if I don’t want more? What if… this is enough?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes closed briefly, as though she were savoring the touch, or maybe bracing herself against it. When she looked at Agatha again, her gaze was filled with a mixture of affection and something darker—acceptance, perhaps, of the very thing she was holding at arm’s length.</p><p>“Don’t say that now. You don’t mean it,” she said, her voice so soft it was almost lost in the rustle of leaves around them. “When the time comes, Agatha, you may see things differently. You may find that what you want… has changed.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, feeling a flash of frustration. “Why do you always do that?” she demanded, her voice laced with a bitterness she hadn’t meant to show. “Why do you keep putting distance between us, as if you’re already… preparing to lose me?”</p><p>Rio’s expression grew pained, but she didn’t look away. “Because I <em> know </em> what it’s like to want something you can’t keep,” she replied, her voice heavy. “And I’ve learned that sometimes, it’s easier to let go before it hurts too much.”</p><p>The words cut deep, and Agatha felt the sting of tears prick at the corners of her eyes. She wanted to argue, to tell Rio that it didn’t have to be that way, but part of her knew that Rio’s fears weren’t unfounded. A deal was a deal and neither pacts between witches nor death were easily broken.</p><p>Taking a steadying breath, she took Rio’s hand in hers, intertwining their fingers. “Then let me be the one to decide that,” she said firmly. “I want to be here—I <em> chose </em> to be here—isn’t that enough?”</p><p>For a long moment, Rio didn’t answer, and Agatha feared she might pull away, and retreat back into that guarded place that Agatha could never quite reach. But instead, Rio’s fingers tightened around hers, her gaze softening, and Agatha felt the faintest hint of a smile.</p><p>“It is enough,” Rio murmured at last, her voice barely more than a whisper. “For now.”</p><p>The words should have been a comfort, but they only deepened the ache in Agatha’s chest. This promise was fragile, as though it could shatter with the slightest push. Yet, she held on, clinging to the warmth of Rio’s hand and the closeness that, for now, was enough.</p><p>The garden around them was hushed tonight, steeped in a comforting darkness that made the faintly glowing blooms seem almost ethereal. </p><p>Agatha settled beneath sweeping tendrils of the willow tree that had grown rapidly to now stand proudly at its full height. She leaned against the bark as the leaves played their own kind of music as they brushed against the grass and stone. After a moment, Rio joined her. She surprised Agatha as she moved to lay down, resting her head in Agatha’s lap. </p><p>Her anger and fear from before had simmered. Now she just looked tired. She relaxed now and Agatha scratched at her temples, both content, enjoying the quiet company. Perhaps it was easier if they didn’t speak. She focused on the solid warmth of her presence, listening to the rhythmic rise and fall of her breathing. It was peaceful—too peaceful, in fact, for the thoughts stirring within her.</p><p>Curiosity gnawed at Agatha. It had been weeks, maybe a month, or perhaps more. It was hard to tell the passage of time in this strange place. Beyond the whistle of the train signaling more souls arriving there was nothing to mark any difference between one moment and the next. And despite however much time had or hadn’t passed, this strange, compelling woman against her felt like a mystery she’d only begun to unravel. Every so often, there’d be a look or a stray comment, something that hinted at a life before, at experiences Agatha couldn’t imagine. She knew so little, and after everything they’d shared, this unknowing was starting to feel like a barrier she wanted to cross.</p><p>“You know,” Agatha began quietly, her voice soft, testing the waters, “you’ve never really told me much about… well, yourself.”</p><p>Rio’s posture stiffened ever so slightly, a subtle shift that only someone close could notice, though she didn’t pull away. Her eyes were fixed on a night-blooming flower nearby, its dark purple petals curling open in the cool air.</p><p>“What are you wanting to know?” Rio replied lightly, though her tone held a faint edge.</p><p>“Anything, really. I mean… I don’t even know how you became… this,” Agatha said, choosing her words with care, though her curiosity was earnest. “Or if you’ve always been this way.” She glanced down at Rio, hoping for a glance in return, but Rio remained unmoved, her gaze distant. </p><p>Rio took a deep breath, finally letting her head fall from Agatha’s lap and she rolled to her back, looking up at the starless sky. “There’s not much to tell. Or at least, not much that would make any sense.”</p><p>“Try me,” Agatha urged, her voice warm and encouraging. She slipped down the tree until she was lying on her side facing Rio. She reached out and placed her hand on her ribs, trying to coax her into opening up. “I just want to know more about you. I know you’re supposed to be this mysterious being beyond comprehension,” she teased before her voice grew gentle again. “But I know there’s more to you than that.”</p><p>For a moment, Rio’s expression softened, a brief vulnerability flashing across her face. But it was gone as quickly as it had appeared, replaced by a neutral mask, and Agatha felt her skin grow colder under her touch. She watched her hand rise and fall against Rio’s ribcage as the woman breathed in the cool air.</p><p>“There are some things, Agatha,” Rio said, her voice low, almost reluctant, “that are better left unspoken. My past is one of them.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, trying to gauge how far she could push without losing this moment of closeness. “I don’t mean to pry… but, don’t you think it’s only fair I start to know more? I mean… after everything.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze finally met hers, but her eyes were guarded, a flicker of something—regret?—in their depths. “I’m not hiding things to be cruel,” she replied, a slight edge creeping into her voice. “But whatever you imagine, I can promise you it’s not nearly as interesting as you’d hope.” She moved her hand to cover Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha could feel the distance creeping back in as if an invisible wall had slipped between them despite their current closeness. Her chest tightened, and she scrambled to keep the connection alive.</p><p>“Try me. I’m not looking for some fairytale,” she countered, trying to keep her tone light. “I just… I want to understand you better. Who you are now and who you were.”</p><p>Rio sighed, her jaw tightening. She rolled to face Agatha fully, her expression harder than Agatha was used to seeing it, an almost steely resolve taking hold. “The woman, whatever I was, Agatha… she doesn’t exist anymore. She hasn’t for a very very long time.” Her voice carried a note of finality. “You’re asking me to dig up a grave.”</p><p>Agatha sat in silence, her mind racing as she considered Rio’s words. Part of her wanted to push further, to pry open that closed door and reach the woman behind it. But the tension in Rio’s posture, the way she seemed to withdraw into herself, gave her pause. Agatha didn’t want to drive her away.</p><p>A heavy quiet settled between them, broken only by the soft rustle of leaves in the breeze. After a long moment, Agatha tried to bridge the gap again, this time with a softer touch. Her hand moved to trail along Rio’s arm.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to push,” she said quietly. “I just… I care about you.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened just a fraction, though her eyes remained shadowed. “I know.” She reached out, touching Agatha’s face briefly, letting her thumb brush against her cheek before pulling back. “Just… don’t expect me to be someone I’m not.”</p><p>Agatha managed a small, sad smile. “I wouldn’t dream of it.”</p><p>Rio nodded, but said nothing more. They lay together in silence, closer yet separated by an invisible chasm that Agatha could feel widening even as Rio remained by her side. She had wanted honesty, and she had it—though the truth, it seemed, came with its own form of distance.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that Rio had drifted to a place she could never follow. Like when she made her trips above to the surface. She always came back, but then always left again. And Agatha couldn’t help but consider again the time that had already passed here. For the first time, returning to the surface seemed like a hollow thing. </p><p>As the minutes passed, the garden around them began to feel colder, more shadowed, and Agatha was left with a deep ache—a sense that something precious was slipping through her fingers, though she couldn’t say why. </p><p>Agatha lay there, quiet, staring at the canopy of leaves above, and felt that emptiness settle deep in her chest. The months were creeping by faster than she’d anticipatedd, and the realization struck her with a clarity she hadn’t prepared for. Soon, her time here would be over—this strange, miraculous sanctuary she’d carved out with Rio would be gone. </p><p>Initially, she had been so sure of herself, convinced that her return to the surface would be triumphant. She’d envisioned herself unlocking her powers, mastering them, rising to face her coven with undeniable proof of her strength. She’d imagined the awe on their faces, the respect that would be hard-earned but at last freely given. It was a fantasy she had clung to, like armor, against all her uncertainties. But now, that triumphant return felt like a faded echo of something she no longer wanted. The thought of stepping away from Rio, from this place, was unbearably bitter.</p><p>Agatha shifted on the ground, her hand trailing across the grass as she fought the impulse to reach for Rio again, to cling to her as if that could make everything stop. Her voice came out in a whisper, almost as if she were afraid of the truth in it.</p><p>“You know, when I first came here, I thought this was just… a stepping stone.” She hesitated, searching for the right words. “I thought it would lead me somewhere bigger, somewhere more… victorious.”</p><p>Rio didn’t speak, but her eyes flickered with an intensity that showed she was listening.</p><p>“I just wanted to be powerful,” Agatha continued, voice laced with an unfamiliar edge of bitterness. “To return with this great, undeniable magic, enough to make my coven see what I could be. To prove I was… worthy.” She shook her head, a soft, rueful laugh escaping. “But now that feels… small. Empty.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened, but still held a hint of that guarded sorrow she always kept close. “Why does it feel empty now?” she asked quietly.</p><p>“Because I didn’t know what I’d find here,” Agatha murmured, her eyes searching Rio’s face, though Rio wouldn’t quite meet her gaze fully. “I didn’t know I’d find something—someone—worth more than all that. I’m not ready. I want more time.”</p><p>Rio’s expression flickered, a flash of something raw that she quickly tried to cover, her mouth pressed into a thin line. “You have a life beyond here, Agatha,” she said, her voice low and carefully neutral. “A future, a path to follow. I won’t be the thing that takes you from that. That wasn’t the bargain.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand moved to rest over Rio’s heart, as though holding her there could keep her from slipping away. “But what if I don’t want that deal anymore? What if I found something here that means more than whatever might be waiting for me up there?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened, her face an unreadable mask, and Agatha felt a flicker of frustration at how effortlessly Rio managed to retreat behind it, shutting her out. For weeks, they had fallen into a quiet, intimate rhythm. They’d spent countless nights like this, their silences filled with an unspoken trust. But now, with her heart laid bare, Agatha felt more alone than she had in a long time.</p><p>“I know what it’s like to let go of a path,” Rio finally said, her voice barely more than a murmur. “And sometimes… what you find after isn’t always what you hoped.”</p><p>Agatha could feel the distance creeping back, but something in her resisted. She felt a swell of resentment, raw and unexpected, toward the world above that expected her to return—to be the same person she had been when she left. She wasn’t. She wasn’t sure she could ever be.</p><p>She leaned closer, voice trembling with something fierce and desperate. “But I don’t want to look back at this as some… some passing thing.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened, and for a moment, her hand brushed against Agatha’s cheek, her fingers featherlight, as if caught between the urge to hold on and the knowledge that she shouldn’t. “Sometimes, things are meant to be beautiful for a moment, Agatha. That’s what makes them precious,” she said, her voice barely audible</p><p>The words hung in the air like a finality, and Agatha felt a chill settle into her bones. She could feel the expiration date looming over them, and the thought made her sick. She closed her eyes, leaning into Rio’s hand as if she could will it to stay, as if she could hold onto the warmth of this night forever.</p><p>She opened her eyes and took in Rio’s face, committing it to memory with a quiet desperation she hadn’t anticipated. She wanted to speak, to promise she would stay, that they could find a way. But the words wouldn’t come.</p><p>And somewhere, in the back of her mind, she realized the quiet darkness of the garden wasn’t as peaceful as it had seemed. It was the silence of something precious slipping away.</p><p>“We still have time though,” she said thoughtfully.</p><p>“And there will be more,” Rio murmured. “Don’t forget that. You do have to return. That deal is done. But you’ll get to come home.” Her lips quirked, displeased at her own words, as if she’d given something away.</p><p>Agatha studied Rio, the way she held herself with such certainty—an unshakable calm that seemed to reject the very notion of clinging. Agatha felt a pang, realizing how much she resented that serenity. She couldn’t reconcile the depth of what they shared with the thought that, one day, it might all be… over. Just a memory.</p><p>“You say that so easily,” she said, a tremor in her voice. “Like you don’t feel any of this.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze flicked back to her, a faint shadow crossing her face. “It’s not that simple,” she replied. “Feelings, memories—they’re powerful. They shape us. But clinging to them…” She hesitated, then let out a quiet sigh. “It doesn’t always keep them alive. Sometimes, it suffocates them.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, fighting back a sudden rush of emotion. She wanted to argue, to find the words that would convince Rio of what she felt deep in her heart—that this wasn’t fleeting. That it couldn’t be.</p><p>“Maybe,” she whispered, leaning close, “I’m not ready to accept that yet.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers brushed along her cheek, a fleeting touch that left a trail of warmth and ache in its wake. “Then hold on to what you must,” she murmured, her voice softer than Agatha had ever heard it. “But remember—this is your path. And no matter where it takes you… you’ll always find your way back.”</p><p>The words settled over them, thick and heavy, the “to me” left unspoken. There was strength in the vulnerability of this bond shaped by both the beauty of the moment and the looming shadow of its end.</p><p>“I will, always,” she said firmly before closing the space between them, rolling on top of Rio to kiss her again.</p><p>If she had but moments, she’d make them worthwhile.</p><p>This <em>would</em> be worth it.</p><p>She brushed Rio’s hair from her face, and noticed how it fanned out like a shroud around her.</p><p>They had kissed many times, but hadn’t progressed further since that encounter on the throne. Importantly, she hadn’t been able to touch Rio fully. There was a new desperation brewing in her. Not the primal want that they’d been swept up in before. Not the hunger that had led to her splayed out breathless upon that throne. Not the need that crept up around during the nights that she had touched herself imagining hands that weren’t her own. This was something else entirely.</p><p>Agatha’s hand lingered in Rio's hair, fingers slipping through the dark strands as her eyes traced Rio’s face, committing each line and shadow to memory. Her proud jaw, the almost imperceptible freckles scattered over her nose, the bow of her lips. The tension between them, a delicate balance of need and restraint, hung in the air as Agatha leaned closer, her heart pounding. They had shared so much, and yet, tonight, there was a rawness—a need—that she could no longer ignore.</p><p>Her voice softened, almost a murmur against Rio’s lips. “Let’s stay like this, just… for tonight.” She kissed at her jaw, trying to prove her want wasn’t selfish. She wanted to serve.</p><p>Rio’s gaze flickered with something deep and unreadable, but she didn’t pull away. Instead, her hand moved to Agatha’s back, steady and grounding, like an invitation without words. Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s fingers traced along her shoulder, anchoring her there, welcoming her closeness.</p><p>Who was she to deny her. She couldn’t fathom it. Slowly, Agatha closed the space between them again, her lips brushing Rio’s with a tenderness that promised more than words ever could. She didn’t think about the future or the uncertain goodbyes—only this moment and the warmth shared between them.</p><p>Rio sighed softly, lifting her chin and anchoring her hand in Agatha’s messy hair. The tree's leaves grew thick around them, curtaining them, shielding them. Every touch was exceedingly gentle as she removed Rio’s clothes. Each kiss against newly revealed skin was a promise. A plea.</p><p>Rio seemed to glow here underneath the ethereal light. Her body was unblemished, not a single scar or imperfection. Agatha’s hands moved with reverence. She wanted to absorb everything.<br/>
<br/>
Her lips moved to Rio’s breast, taking it gently into her mouth and letting her tongue explore. She smiled as she felt Rio arch up closer to her. The gasp as the woman’s breath hitched was something that she’d never be able to shake. She could never want to. She moved to the other side, trailing a hand down the dip beneath her ribs, over her stomach.</p><p>Another sound, a whimper, the most beautiful noise she had ever heard. A siren’s song. Agatha smiled, moving her head back to kiss the hollow of her shoulder.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful,” she sighed against her skin.</p><p>“You’re the only one who thinks so.” Rio replied, her words coming out as a half gasp as Agatha’s clever fingers moved lower still.</p><p>Agatha chuckled against her neck and pulled her head away for a moment. Rio made a small displeased sound but it was soon silenced by another kiss. Agatha flashed a wry smile at her, “Good. I don’t like to share.”</p><p>Any further quips were silenced, as Agatha pressed the tips of two fingers inside her. Rio cried out, a sharp needy sound that broke the calm of the garden.</p><p>Her fingers pressed deeper, curling as she beckoned death closer. It was a certainty that Agatha would far too soon be the one called away. But until that time came, she was perfectly content to spend every minute just like this.</p>

<p>
<span>The throne room was silent as Rio sat alone. She had come to this place often lately, retreating to its familiar shadows whenever she felt the need to think. Though Agatha’s sly mischief and warmth filled most corners of her world now, there were moments like these when solitude reminded her of what she’d allowed herself to be exposed to. What she now felt. What she would soon need to let go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hunger to understand, to </span>
<em>
<span>command</span>
</em>
<span>, was admirable—and dangerous. So unreasonably attractive. But Rio knew all too well what power did to those who pursued it too ardently; it was intoxicating and unforgiving. Agatha might not yet realize how much she’d changed, but the shift in her was undeniable. Every day, her magic grew stronger, sharper, more adept. And every day, the memory of Agatha as she’d first arrived—the girl who knew little of who she was, or what she would become—faded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes, allowing herself a rare moment of rest. She thought of how Agatha’s laughter seemed to ease the weight she bore, her presence a balm she’d never thought to seek. Her rosy lips, a gentle caress. She couldn’t stop thinking about her. Why would she want to?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Moments in time came back to Rio like leaves on water, drifting into her mind unbidden yet comforting. There had been that day in the garden, for instance, when Agatha had leaned close to examine a newly bloomed sprout, her face lit with pure fascination. She’d looked back at Rio with a grin that almost dared her to feel something in return. Rio had looked away, but later, her mind would bring back that exact image with an almost painful clarity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or that evening under the willow, when Agatha had fallen asleep against her shoulder. The moment had been fragile, held together only by the quiet sounds of Agatha’s breathing, the weight of her resting there, trusting. Rio had sat unmoving for hours, almost afraid to breathe lest she wake her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have I been out long?” Agatha had asked, wiping the sleep from her eyes. Adorably disheveled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, sweetheart,” she said, the pet name slipping from her freely. Agatha didn’t comment on it, but perhaps that was because had swooped in, magic assisting her only </span>
<em>
<span>slightly</span>
</em>
<span> as she lifted Agatha into her arms and whispered, “Let’s get you to your bed. Your back will hurt if you fall asleep on the roots again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The night after Agatha’s first true success with the pool’s magic… when she’d danced around the cathedral leaving bloody footprints in her wake, laughing with a joy so raw it left Rio speechless. In a rare, impulsive gesture, Rio had joined her in that unguarded moment, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s. She’d laughed then—one of the few times she could remember feeling free. Agatha had spun into her arms with a dramatic flourish. Like a partner in a dance. Agatha had grabbed her face and kissed her fiercely, drunk on victory. They’d spent the night together celebrating Agatha’s success. She loved how feisty success made her. How fiery she had been that night, as she told Rio, </span>
<em>
<span>ordered her really</span>
</em>
<span>, just where and how to touch her. Rio had been all too happy to oblige. Rio didn’t need sleep technically, but after that night she’d been a little more sluggish than usual as she went about her work the next day. And if a few souls got a couple hours of extra time, what of it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, as so often does when moments of contagious joy are experienced by those who have felt too little of it, a small dread had started to grow in her like a parasite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t been foolish to let herself believe in these fleeting moments, </span>
<em>
<span>had she</span>
</em>
<span>? How easily she had begun to fall into them—letting Agatha draw her out, inch by inch, into spaces she had long since abandoned. She’d felt it in Agatha’s laughter, echoing through the corridors, in the gentle weight of her head resting on Rio’s shoulder as they watched shadows dance across the garden.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Such moments had begun to sink into her heart, even as she tried to guard herself. She was an immortal indestructible thing, not limited to a being, she was a force of nature. Never had she felt more exposed. It thrilled her. It frightened her. That was a new feeling and she didn’t know what to make of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>More memories echoed. A night shortly after Agatha first came here, when they’d walked the edges of a spring that had formed in the corner of the garden. Walking together, fingers brushing as Agatha balanced on the rocks, her voice echoing with questions about ancient magics. Rio hadn’t meant to, but she’d reached out instinctually, steadying Agatha as she teetered on a loose stone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had laughed, a bright, genuine sound that struck Rio somewhere deep. She found herself looking at Agatha a moment too long, her hand lingering, feeling the warmth of her pulse. It was the kind of touch she hadn’t shared in centuries. Yet she’d quickly withdrawn, cloaking her heart behind practiced indifference.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later that same night Agatha had fallen asleep in her room, a book still open in her lap. Agatha had invited her to return to her room that night when her business in the city was done. It had taken longer than expected. Something was making the shades restless. Unruly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had found her there, and without thinking, she’d brushed a stray lock of hair from Agatha’s forehead, her fingers grazing her skin. She’d felt her breath hitch, an unexpected tenderness seeping in as she watched Agatha sleep, her face softened by dreams. She’d convinced herself it was nothing, just a lapse, a result of the silence and the quiet vulnerability of the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But those moments stacked up, creeping into her defenses, making her ache with a longing she hadn’t known in centuries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The strongest memory, the one she visited most frequently and selfishly, was that night Agatha had claimed her in the garden. Rio hadn’t meant for things to go that far, hadn’t intended to let Agatha in so deeply. But the warmth between them had overpowered her caution, her resolve crumbling beneath the weight of that intimacy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She could recall every detail—the way Agatha’s fingers had trembled slightly, but her gaze held steady, vulnerable yet resolute. Rio had seen a tenderness there that stripped her of all her defenses, laying her bare in a way she had not felt in ages. For that single night, the carefully guarded boundaries she’d built around herself fell away, and she had allowed Agatha to see her, fully, without any of the armor that had long defined her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was the memory that lingered the longest, a constant thrum beneath the surface, a presence that filled the quiet spaces between them. She found herself recalling it when she was alone, the way Agatha’s face softened, the quiet intimacy of shared breaths, the moments where words had fallen away entirely, leaving a voice she didn’t recognize—even though it was her own—crying out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They way Agatha’s had kissed over inch of her. How when they finally parted, there were dozens of meadow flowers left where their bodies had rolled in the grass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That night had been a quiet surrender, one she’d never intended to give. One that had slipped out of her the moment Agatha’s finger had pressed inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If she was honest with herself though, she’d surrendered—</span>
<em>
<span>parts of her at least</span>
</em>
<span>— to this witch much earlier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, seated alone in her throne room, Rio let out a sigh, her chest tightening as the truth threatened to break through. She had been careless. She had been foolish, too easily entangled in this strange and tender connection they’d built together. Too clouded with lust. Agatha had sought her out for power; she had come here to learn and to leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was what Rio told herself—that these shared touches, these glances, were nothing more than Agatha playing some silent game, gathering pieces of Rio’s soul to arm herself with, just to spite the world above. She told herself this, even as a quiet voice in her head whispered, “</span>
<em>
<span>You’re wrong</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>Don’t lie. You’ve never felt so alive.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hand closed into a fist, the ache blooming sharp in her chest as she forced herself to look past these small betrayals of her own restraint. All of this would change once Agatha left. How quickly would Agatha outgrow these memories, replace them with those of her newfound power, her life on the surface, her coven watching in awe?</span>
</p><p>
<span>How soon would she lose interest in Rio? How long before some other lover, one not made of sharp edges but warm sun-kissed skin, whispered sweet nothings, words that Rio would not allow herself to give. She couldn’t compete with the vibrancy of the living. Someone that Agatha could share in the experience of </span>
<em>
<span>life</span>
</em>
<span> with. To share ripe fruit on a hot day, to kiss in a spring rain shower, to love and grow old with. That human experience, the beauty of the mundane, Rio would never be able to offer her that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, despite her bitterness, those memories—Agatha’s smile, her whispered secrets, her playful banter and bravado, the soft breathy gasps that she made when Rio touched her just so—refused to fade. Rio pressed a hand to her heart, willing it to quiet, but the ache only grew. She had been foolish indeed, she thought, to let this attachment bloom where it had no place. Soon, she’d be alone again. She’d be a memory, another stepping stone for Agatha’s ambition. She couldn’t even fault her for it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But some part of her clung to the hope, even if she’d never admit it, that Agatha would remember her too—not just as a means to power, but as someone who, for a moment, had truly been hers. No one else had ever had that claim. There had never been someone like her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nevertheless, Agatha’s return to the surface was inevitable, and that thought was a thorn, lodging deeper with every passing day. Because once Agatha went back, what then?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t doubt that Agatha would become exactly what she wanted to be upon her return. Relentless. She would dazzle them, all of </span>
<em>
<span>them</span>
</em>
<span>, with her newfound power, perhaps more than she herself could even imagine. And Rio wouldn’t even be able to relish in that moment with her. She would have half a year's worth of life while Rio would be left completely in the dark. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She worried, too, that Agatha might forget the fragile bond they’d built here. She imagined a world in which Agatha would return with a hunger no longer for Rio, but for even more power—a taste for the world above that would inevitably pull her away from the quiet, dark beauty they’d created together. She would just be a means to an end. An inconvenience. Wasn’t that always the way she’d been seen? A literal dead end.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could almost see it now: Agatha, standing tall among her coven, her power undeniable, her spirit untamed, looking back on these six months as a strange but distant memory—a passing chapter in a long story.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled, steadying herself. She would steel herself, as she had before, knowing that whatever heartbreak waited, it would be nothing new. Her fingers tapped softly against the edge of her throne as she surveyed the empty hall, her thoughts tangled webs of regret and resentment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d been foolish—too open, too willing to let Agatha in, to share herself in ways she’d long forbidden. She’d known, from the moment Agatha arrived, that this connection would come with a price, but she’d let herself believe it might be different, that Agatha was different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How naive. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The more she dwelled on it, the more twisted the memories became. Those shared glances and touches, the nights spent in soft conversation felt suddenly tainted—like a spell cast over her, something meant to ensnare her, to soften her defenses so that Agatha could take what she wanted without resistance. Power. It was always about power with her. That’s what it was all about for them both, wasn’t it? Rio had seen it before: mortals were drawn to her domain not for understanding, not for connection, but for the allure of what lay beyond the veil, the promise of mastery over things forbidden.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio's lips pressed into a hard line. She bit the inside of her cheek harshly. She tasted the iron of her own blood. The bitterness and tang cleared the haze from her. Agatha, for all her talk of closeness and sincerity, had always had her own motives. She could see that now, couldn’t she? Agatha’s endless questions about magic, her incessant probing into Rio’s life and history, had all been a means to an end. A way to discover and harness whatever secrets Rio kept so closely guarded. Agatha was no different from the others who had come here wanting. Only, she had been cleverer, hiding her hunger behind a softness that Rio had let herself believe was genuine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clenched her jaw, her bitterness rising like bile. She saw Agatha’s touch in a new light now—each caress, each whispered confession, all part of some elaborate game. It was a dangerous thing, to mistake desire for affection. And she had played right into it, letting herself be drawn in, letting Agatha see parts of her she’d kept hidden for centuries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her chest tightened with a bitter twist of realization. What had she expected? That Agatha would leave her world behind? That she would come willingly back to this place of shadows and forget the taste of the sunlight above? When Agatha returned to the surface, she would have all the power she’d sought—more than enough to captivate her coven and take her place among them. And when the time came to return here, would she still be that eager? Or would she come reluctantly, no longer needing what Rio had to offer?</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was almost laughable. Rio had always prided herself on her distance, on the cool restraint that allowed her to navigate this realm and the one above without attachments. And now here she was, spiraling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t have that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enough,” she murmured, her voice hard, letting the word echo in the empty hall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It would not do to dwell on this. She weighed both streams of thought. The pleasant memories they’d shared, the cruel tales she’d twisted. The flower and the sickle held in opposite hands. Which would she carry?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Spring was almost here. She had seen it, the day before when she’d visited the surface to collect a soul. The air had carried the barest hints of change—the soft murmur of melting snow, the smell of thawing earth beneath the frozen ground. She could almost see the subtle shift in the colors of the sky, the slow warming of light. And in that quiet change, she could feel time slipping away from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before, she had found herself drawn to the surface in those early days of the changing season, observing the slow, fragile rebirth of life with a cold curiosity. Spring was the season that always reminded her of loss—the growth she could not touch, the warmth she could never bring back with her. She would stand on the edge of the living world and feel herself a stranger there, an interloper in a place that pulsed with vibrancy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This year, though, the season’s arrival carried an even greater weight. Agatha would go, back to that warm, blossoming world, and Rio would be left in the stillness. Her heart ached at the thought. Agatha’s presence had softened the sharp lines of this existence, filling spaces she hadn’t known were empty until now. She could feel it slipping from her grasp like sand through her fingers, and it was a sensation she found intolerable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But tonight, she thought, she could choose differently. She could push aside the bitter coil of resentment and the tightening ache of loss. Just this once, she could let herself be with Agatha without thinking of the future, without calculating what their inevitable separation would take from her. Without her guard. Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>would</span>
</em>
<span> be leaving, her magic brightening with every passing day, drawing her closer to the surface. But until then, she was still here, still within reach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The decision settled like a flame in her chest, and she found herself in motion, leaving the throne room and seeking Agatha. Her steps were determined and as she walked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio found her, Agatha was standing at the entrance to the garden, her back to her, shoulders wrapped in quiet contemplation as she looked out over the darkened flowers, many of which had grown and flourished under her touch. Her hair was down, messy from a day spent running her hands through it in thought. The silvery glow outlined Agatha’s form, casting her in an otherworldly light, a sight so striking that Rio felt it pierce through her heart like a physical ache. She couldn’t help the soft smile that pulled at her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Agatha," she called gently, the sound no more than a whisper, yet Agatha turned, her gaze softening with a warmth that made Rio’s resolve slip just a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Rio," Agatha replied, her voice almost reverent. She looked at her as if she were something precious, something worth cherishing, and it made Rio’s heart stammer, though she kept her face composed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without another word, Rio crossed the distance between them, reaching for Agatha’s hand. She didn’t speak of what lay ahead, didn’t tell her of the emptiness she’d feel when Agatha left. Instead, she let herself hold on, entwining their fingers, her touch lingering with a tenderness that she had, until now, only allowed in fleeting moments.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If this is to be your last night here before the world above calls you back…” Her voice was low, laced with something she couldn’t name, or perhaps was too afraid to. “Then let it be ours.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression softened, a flicker of understanding passing between them. The tension of what lay unspoken dissolved into a quiet acceptance, and Rio allowed herself to give in, to pull Agatha close. She traced her fingers along Agatha’s cheek, memorizing the warmth of her skin, the way Agatha’s breath hitched ever so slightly at her touch. Tonight, she would not let herself think of the seasons ahead, nor the lingering ache of tomorrow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just this once, she would let the night be enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She loved her so much in that moment.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha brushed her fingertips against her lips. She stood in the glade alone, left with the feeling of a parting kiss. A warmth that was rapidly fading. She traced her lips one more time and steadied herself, taking a deep breath, and took her first steps under the light of the sun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Each step brought her closer to her coven, to the towering stone that marked the outer circle of their sacred ground. Here, the air was heavy with the familiar scent of wild herbs and damp earth, a place she’d once thought of as home. Now, though, it felt foreign, like she was intruding upon someone else’s domain. She shook off the feeling, reminding herself of the reason she had come—to show them what she had become, the power she had embraced.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But even that purpose felt hollow. The moment she’d left Rio behind, a weight had settled in her chest, the memory of Rio’s touch fading like morning mist. She pushed it aside, burying it under the sharper feeling of her resolve. This was her time to face them, to finally break the silence that had followed her since her first hesitant steps into their world. She was finally ready. She would be undeniable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she approached, the quiet murmur of voices grew louder, blending into a tense, wary hush as they noticed her presence. Seven familiar faces turned toward her, eyes narrowed, lips pressed tight. She stood at the edge of the clearing, the ground itself seeming to reject her, the cold and stillness seeping through her boots. Her mother was the first to break the silence, stepping forward with a gaze that seemed to pierce through her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” her mother said, her voice a low, simmering contempt. “You’ve returned.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straightened, meeting her mother’s gaze with one of defiance. “I have.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another member of the coven, a tall, dark-haired woman Agatha had once admired, sneered as she took her place beside her mother. “And what do you think you’ve brought back with you?” she asked, her voice dripping with disdain. “More wild tales? Or something worse? You stink of death, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bitterness in their words stung, but Agatha swallowed it down, lifting her chin. “I’ve learned things that none of you could have taught me,” she replied, her voice steady. “I went beyond your boundaries, sought power you told me was beyond reach. And I have returned stronger for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother’s lips curved into a scornful smile. “Power,” she echoed, her eyes cold as she looked Agatha up and down, as if she were a stranger. “What makes you think you’re deserving of that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, startled by the venom in her mother’s voice. “Deserving?” she repeated, clenching her fists. “I thought I wasn’t good enough mother, that I didn’t meet your expectations. So I went and—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good enough?” her mother cut in, her voice like ice. “You were never anything close to good, Agatha. Your very existence was a mistake.” She took a step closer, her voice lowering to a whisper laced with contempt. “You’re nothing but an evil thing. You always have been. From the moment you drew breath you were touched with darkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart pounded in her chest, the words slicing through her like a blade. She had always felt the distance between herself and the coven, but this… She searched her mother’s face, looking for some sign of remorse or reluctance. But there was only cold certainty, a conviction that left her breathless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The other members of the coven stood silent, their eyes cast down or narrowed in disgust. Agatha’s gaze swept over them, searching for someone who might stand beside her. Looking for anyone who would even make eye contact. But they only looked away, as if her presence was tainting the very ground beneath them. Cowards.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So this is it, then?” she said, her voice shaking. “This was never about my magic, or how unruly I was. You just… didn’t want me here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother sneered, folding her arms. “You think yourself so clever, coming to this revelation at last. You don’t belong, Agatha. Not here, not with us. The only thing you’re good for is bringing ruin.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A silence settled over them, thick and suffocating. Agatha’s hands trembled as she struggled to keep her composure, to keep her emotions in check. The power she had returned with hummed beneath her skin, a steady rhythm that reminded her of the depth she’d gained in Rio’s realm. The strength she’d learned to wield was hers, and hers alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” she said, the words slipping through gritted teeth. “You don’t have to see it. But I’ll never be what you wanted, and I won’t let you tell me who I am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A ripple of power surged through her, and the air around her shifted, a faint, dark purple aura forming as her magic reacted to the anger seething within her. She saw the flicker of fear in their eyes, and it filled her with a cold, satisfying vindication.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without another word, she turned her back on them, refusing to give them the satisfaction of seeing the pain on her face. She would walk away from them, from this place of bitterness and smallness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But her mother didn’t let her. “Agatha!” she called, “Where do you think you’re going.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Isn’t it obvious mother? You don’t want me here. I don’t have to settle for somewhere I’m not wanted anymore,” she hissed, turning to face her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother laughed cruelly. “Child, you’re not <em>wanted</em> anywhere. You never will be.” She raised her hand and twisted it in the air. “Sisters! I cannot undo my mistake in bringing this spawn into this world. But with your help, we will scourge her from this surface.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The witches approached as Agatha stayed put, rooted in this spot. Her heart raced. She would not give them the satisfaction of running. She wasn’t afraid. She would </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> be afraid again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The coven moved as one, encircling Agatha like predators closing in on their prey, their hands crackling with ominous energy. Agatha kept her stance firm, her jaw clenched as she felt her own magic stir within her, deep and steady, fueled by something stronger than anger. She had left behind the last of her fear in Rio’s realm; here, she would stand her ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One of the coven members thrust a hand forward, sending a bolt of jagged, crimson light searing through the air toward her. Agatha reacted without hesitation, lifting her own hand to conjure a shield, her magic coalescing into a wall of shadow. The bolt slammed against it, scattering into harmless sparks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother sneered. “Is that what you came to boast you learned in the depths below? Tricks and illusions?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond. Another spell streaked toward her, an icy tendril aimed at her legs, but she twisted sideways, the ice skimming past her, leaving a frozen scar on the ground where she had stood. Another witch aimed a spell high, and Agatha ducked behind a tree, the blast scattering leaves and bark like confetti in the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The witches grew bolder, spells flying faster, yet none found their mark. Agatha moved between the trees, raising dark shields and deflecting bursts of magic that shattered in vibrant flashes against her defenses. She could feel their frustration mounting, feel them feeding on it, their energy only intensifying in the air around them. They would not relent. They wanted her broken.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She would not break.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mother watched her, eyes narrowed as she raised her arms, the air crackling with something darker, more insidious. Her voice echoed across the clearing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think you’re so powerful?” she sneered. “Let’s see if you can match the strength of those who gave you your pathetic life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother began a twisting gesture, her hands weaving a spell Agatha recognized—the binding. Agatha barely had time to react, attempting to summon a shield, but the spell coiled around it, sinking through her defenses with relentless force. The moment it made contact, a chill seeped through her limbs, paralyzing her, and locking her magic in place. She staggered, her body no longer under her own control, as the magical bonds solidified around her wrists and ankles, binding her to the spot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The witches closed in, their eyes glittering with anticipation and malice. Her mother stepped forward, a triumphant smile spreading across her face. She raised her hand, fingers curling in a way that made Agatha’s skin prickle with dread.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is the end of the line for you, Agatha. You’re not welcome here. You’re not welcome </span>
<b>anywhere</b>
<span>,” her mother spat, voice seething with years of pent-up disdain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pulse quickened as she struggled against the bindings, feeling her own magic rise in defiance, but her mother’s spell was tightening like a vice. She could feel her power trapped beneath the surface, struggling to break free.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's breath came in sharp, shallow gasps as she strained against the binding, every fiber of her being resisting the enchantment. In this moment, she thought of Rio’s voice, steady and unwavering, guiding her as she’d learned to tap into the pool’s energy. Her mother’s cruel words echoed, mingling with the memory of Rio’s instructions, her assurances that Agatha’s strength lay not only in her own power but in her connection to the vast, unfathomable forces around her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother circled her. “Look at you now, helpless,” she sneered. She leaned closer, her voice a poisonous whisper. “Useless. You never belonged among us. Weak, unruly... nothing but a curse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A spell surged from her mother’s hand, striking Agatha’s chest with searing pain. Her vision blurred as her muscles seized, agony lancing through her body. She felt her magic struggling against the binding, flaring in response to the attack, a trapped fire clawing to escape. Another spell hit her, followed by another, until the rest of the coven joined in, spells slicing into her like seven swords, waves of brutal, unrelenting pain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But beneath the torment, something else stirred. Agatha’s thoughts drifted to the pool, to the way she’d drawn magic from it, allowing the energy to flow through her, surrounding her and sustaining her. She focused, straining to reach the well of power, to unlock the connection she’d learned in Rio’s realm. She reached out not with desperation but with intent, imagining herself as Rio had always carried herself—calm, deliberate, powerful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As another surge of pain wracked her body, Agatha drew the energy in. The coven’s spells, their hatred, their own vicious magic poured into her, filling her with a burning, terrible strength. Her mother’s horrified expression shifted, sensing the change, but it was too late. Agatha felt their magic seeping into her like water through cracks in a dam, filling her veins with a raw, electric charge that ignited her every nerve. Her bindings cracked and shattered under the force of the siphoned magic, leaving her free. She screamed in rage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The coven gasped, their fear feeding her, their spells fading as she drew not only from their magic but from their life force itself. The witches stumbled, one by one, their faces paling, and then, in a single moment of overwhelming, blinding power, Agatha felt them drop. The ground fell silent as they collapsed in a ring around her, lifeless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bodies lay around her, her mother among them, eyes still open in her final, hateful glare. Agatha stood over them, her heart heavy not with remorse but with a deep, unyielding sorrow. </span>
</p><p>
<span> She felt nothing for what she’d done; if anything, a sense of grim satisfaction settled in her chest. They had forced her hand, and left her with no choice but to end them before they could destroy her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But the weight of it all came from something else. She looked down at her mother, the woman who should have loved her with the same ease she breathed. Agatha felt the ache of all the years she’d hoped for something that would never be—acceptance, kindness, a mother’s embrace that might soothe the edges of her magic instead of stoking its fires. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They had </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> loved her; they had only ever tolerated her presence, a misfit among their ranks. She’d wanted to prove herself, to show them she could be something more, but that hope had been crushed long ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She grieved, not for them but for herself, for the innocence she’d lost in wanting something as simple as love. They had forced her into this battle, forced her to show the very power they’d feared all along. And now, in her bitter victory, she knew that in their eyes, she’d become exactly what they accused her of: a dark force, a threat, something monstrous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straightened, her face hardened and resolute. If they had made her into this, she would bear it proudly. There was no regret. She looked around one last time, then turned her back on the scene, moving away from the place that had once held all her hopes and had now become nothing but a ruin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This would be her last farewell. She was done with them.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Death surveyed the bodies. A massacre.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d feared this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One by one, she walked to the body of each coven member, knelt beside them, and closed their eyes. She was emotionless and clinical as she passed over each of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Last she came to Agatha’s mother. The woman who had summoned her. Who had traded her child. Who had been cruel and scarred her daughter’s heart. This is the woman that had tried to break her. She could feel her spirit, still roiling with hatred and contempt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death pulled a jagged curved knife from her belt. This one didn’t deserve a graceful transition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The body was already cold, but Death slit her throat for good measure.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>In the months that followed, Agatha’s strength bloomed. Every morning, she woke with the thrill of it buzzing beneath her skin, a tangible power that felt boundless. It crackled and roiled in her as certain and steady as her heartbeat. She marveled at the magic she could now wield, at how the spells she’d once struggled to master now flowed through her effortlessly. It was as though each incantation, each spark, had always been there, lying dormant until she’d claimed it as her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The initial sorrow she’d carried—the ache of her mother’s rejection, the bitterness of that final confrontation—softened with time, reshaping itself into something almost triumphant. The betrayal no longer felt raw, but instead a faded scar she’d wear as a testament to her survival.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As her power deepened, she often found herself thinking of Rio. She would close her eyes and imagine the woman’s expression, her cool gaze softening in approval or, perhaps, curiosity. Sometimes, she allowed herself to imagine that Rio might be proud, that her calm, detached demeanor would crack, at the sight of Agatha’s newfound prowess. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a bittersweet fantasy. She also wondered if Rio would have tried to caution her, to remind her of what power could cost, or if she would have understood, silently bearing witness to what Agatha had become. But whether Rio would celebrate her growth or see it as dangerous, one thing was certain: Agatha wanted her to know. To witness what she’d managed to carve out of the darkness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As summer stretched on, Agatha’s days filled with purpose. She roamed the forests alone, strengthening her craft. Many days she brought herself to the edge of exhaustion and beyond it. She learned the language of the land, and felt her senses sharpen until she could almost feel the roots stirring in the soil beneath her feet. She’d let her magic play across her fingertips, watching the smallest sparks flicker, humming softly as if in conversation with her. Her spells became her company, her refuge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As each day crept by, Agatha felt the slow drag of summer pull her down, every sticky, humid afternoon making her long for the cool, shadowed stillness of the underworld. The realm above had lost its luster, its relentless sun pressing down on her until she felt ready to melt into the earth itself. How she missed the way Rio’s domain had whispered with a soft, perpetual chill. The sense of endless space and shadow offered comfort instead of confinement. Here above, the walls of heat closed around her, tightening like a spell gone wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite her powers now humming with a mastery she’d once only dreamed of, a nagging hollowness tempered the satisfaction. She had no one to share her triumphs with. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She began to think of Rio more with each passing day, wondering if, by some unspoken tether, Rio could feel her longing, could sense the ache that refused to dull. In her mind’s eye, Agatha would replay those moments in the underworld—Rio’s cool hand guiding her through magic so immense it felt like the pulse of the earth itself, her dark eyes studying Agatha with a quiet intensity. It hadn’t been warmth, exactly. But it was </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span>, something that Agatha had come to crave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sometimes she’d stop, mid-spell, and find herself staring out toward the edge of the forest, feeling that pull grow stronger. The thought of seeing Rio again, of letting her see the strength she’d cultivated here, kindled a flame of anticipation. She wondered if Rio might reach out to her, call her back as the veil between realms grew thin. The coolness of autumn would soon descend, and with it, her time on the surface would wane, an inevitability she felt winding closer every day. Anticipation coiled within her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But for now, she kept to the forest, channeling her magic, her mind drifting always to the woman who had sent her back with a wordless promise in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The leaves had </span>
<em>
<span>finally</span>
</em>
<span> begun their slow turn toward russet at the edges, and the once-warm winds grew crisper, especially in the mornings. Late-blooming wildflowers dotted the fields, but their colors were softer now, as if they, too, were winding down, preparing to retreat into the earth. Days grew shorter; the golden glow of late afternoon came sooner, casting long shadows that deepened with each passing week.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wondered if Rio could sense her strength, wherever she was, as keenly as Agatha felt it within herself. That pull, that undeniable thread, was still there, more potent than ever, like a gravity she couldn’t defy. In the quiet hours when she allowed herself to let her guard down, she imagined how it might feel to stand in Rio’s presence again, to let her feel the vastness she’d claimed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She dreamed what it would be like when she finally was able to touch her again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One evening, she walked through the dense forest, tracing the path of fading sunlight filtering through the thinning canopy. She stopped by a small stream, watching as leaves—some already tinged with the first signs of red—floated downstream. She’d been here often, listening to the water’s murmurs, letting it drown out the silence that sometimes haunted her. But tonight, it felt different, like a prelude, as if the world itself was shifting, bending toward some culmination.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart stopped. Balanced on top of a wide maple leaf, like a twisted variety of lotus, a single dark and rich bloom. </span>
<em>
<span>Her</span>
</em>
<span> flower from the garden. A calling card.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She clutched her hand at her heart, and tears pricked at the corners of her eyes in a sudden surge of relief. Gasping, she felt her lungs fill to bursting. Agatha laughed, cackled really, as she clutched the flower between her fingers. She raised it to her lips and let the thorn pierce her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she tasted blood she grinned wildly.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Soon, soon, soon. Finally, finally, finally.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio.</span>

<p>
<span>The moment Rio appeared in the woods Agatha ran to her. Her hands grasped desperately at Rio’s arms, her hands, her face. She clung to her as if she were drowning. “I did it,” she gasped, pulling her close and burying her face in the woman’s neck. She inhaled deeply, breathing in the smell of her. “Did you see? I did it. The coven, they turned on me. I unlocked my power. But I did what we practiced at their pool, I took their magic.” Agatha was breathless. Almost crying in relief of not only returning to this familiar embrace but to finally be able to share in her success.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t see the thin line Rio’s lips had pressed into. She hadn’t noticed the worried knot at her brow. “I saw, Agatha,” she said softly, carefully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed softly, her joy spilling over as she clung to Rio. She didn’t register the tension, the way Rio’s body felt less yielding, or how her arms wrapped around her at an unexpected distance. “You saw,” she repeated, breathing the words against Rio’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands rested on her shoulders, but she seemed hesitant, her touch restrained. “I did,” she replied, her voice measured and careful. “You’ve grown… much stronger, Agatha. More than I imagined.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back slightly, eager to catch Rio’s gaze, her own bright with excitement. She searched Rio’s eyes, looking for that glimmer of pride or admiration. But Rio’s expression was guarded, her jaw tight. She noticed a vein in her neck throb. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you… aren’t you proud?” Agatha’s voice softened, her excitement faltering as she registered Rio’s demeanor. She felt the joy of her accomplishment waver under the weight of that distant expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face softened briefly, but the warmth didn’t quite reach her eyes. “It’s not pride or admiration that concerns me, Agatha,” she said quietly, her gaze shifting to the ground. “It’s the weight of things. That kind of power… it doesn’t come without consequences.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straightened, feeling the sting of disappointment settle in her chest. She could almost feel herself deflating under the scrutiny of Rio’s words. “Consequences?” she repeated, her voice tinged with disbelief.  She pulled away with a pained expression. “You know what I faced. You know why I did it. After all that we—” She stopped, biting back her words, her own voice trembling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand dropped from Agatha’s shoulder, and she took a measured breath, as though each word had to be carefully chosen. “It’s not about what you faced, Agatha. I’m not doubting you, or what you went through. I don’t care that a few witches fool enough to come after you fell. I’m only worried about the cost.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her face flush with frustration. She had waited for this moment, had imagined Rio’s face alight with admiration, with shared pride. For months she had dreamed of how they would reunite, how they would celebrate this blessing. All of that shattered. Now she was met with this nightmare, this careful, restrained detachment, as if Rio couldn’t bring herself to give Agatha even a fragment of satisfaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Cost?” Agatha’s voice sharpened, her shoulders squaring as she stepped back. “You think I haven’t paid it already? I fought—</span>
<em>
<span>alone</span>
</em>
<span>—against everything that tried to break me. I didn’t expect a lecture about the ‘weight of things.’” Her words came out sharper than she intended, but she couldn’t hold them back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held her gaze, unflinching. “I’m not lecturing you,” Rio said, her voice still maddeningly calm. “But it would be foolish to ignore what this kind of power can do—what it can </span>
<em>
<span>take from you</span>
</em>
<span> if you’re not careful.” She seemed to weigh her words, her tone more a warning than an accusation. “Agatha, there’s a line that is </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> easy to cross. I just want to make sure you’re—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Careful?” Agatha interrupted, her voice cracking with anger. “Did you think I was reckless? That I haven’t been thinking about every step, every consequence, every risk?” Her voice lowered, frustration gathering in her throat and turning her words into a wounded snarl. “I thought you, </span>
<em>
<span>of all people</span>
</em>
<span>, would understand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression softened, and for a moment, Agatha saw a flicker in her eyes, that look she got when she was on the precipice of vulnerability. But the look was brief, dissolving as quickly as it had come. “It’s not that I don’t understand, Agatha,” she replied, her tone firm but softened around the edges. “It’s that I’m… afraid. Power like this… it has a way of taking more than it gives.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fists clenched at her sides, her chest tightening. “You’re not afraid of my power. You’re afraid of me. And you can’t stand it.” Her words were a barely whispered accusation, but they rang heavy in the space between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face turned to stone, a shadow passing over her eyes. “If that’s what you think, Agatha, then you haven’t understood me at all.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence hung between them, thick with all the words left unsaid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s time to go.” Rio said finally, her tone clipped as she turned. She pulled the dagger from her hip and allowed herself a flash of anger as she buried it in a nearby tree. She wrenched it to the side, prying the tree apart and creating a door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha followed her, fuming now. Every muscle in her body drew tense as they descended through the crack in the tree, spiraling down into the familiar darkness of the underworld. The silence between them felt brittle, charged with everything that had been left unsaid on the surface. The air grew colder the deeper they went, but Agatha barely noticed. Her anger smoldered, bright and raw, like embers pressed beneath her skin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had waited so long for this reunion, for this moment that was now spoiled. The thrill of her accomplishment had dulled, replaced by a hollow ache in her chest. The thought clawed at her, a wound she couldn’t stop pressing her fingers into. Drawing out the hurt, drawing blood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha quickened her pace until she was just behind Rio. “So, what is it, then?” she demanded, her voice tight. “What exactly are you afraid of, if it’s not me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s shoulders stiffened, but she kept walking, saying nothing, her face set like marble. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s patience snapped. She surged forward, stepping in front of Rio to block her path. “No, you don’t get to ignore this. You don’t get to shut down when it’s me wanting answers. For months, I’ve thought of nothing but you. And this—” She waved her hands, gesturing to the dark, silent landscape around them, her voice rising. “This is how you welcome me back?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flashed with something unreadable, but her face remained guarded. “We can discuss this later, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. We discuss it </span>
<b>now</b>
<span>,” Agatha hissed, closing the space between them. “I want to know if everything I thought we shared was a lie. If every time you looked at me, you were just waiting for me to fail.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw clenched. Her eyes held Agatha’s gaze, but there was something distant as if she’d already pulled herself away. Rio’s voice was low, her words laced with bitterness and hurt. “I was trying to protect you—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“From what?” Agatha shouted, shoving Rio’s shoulder, in a desperate attempt to shake her out of that infuriating composure. “From becoming something you can’t control? Or from becoming someone you might actually care about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio staggered back, her expression swirling between many emotions—shock, pain, anger—it was hard to tell. But she didn’t respond. Instead, she stood there, breathing hard, as if the weight of what Agatha had said was settling over her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought I meant something to you,” Agatha whispered, her voice barely holding together. “But if all you see in me now is a threat, then maybe I never did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face softened, and she reached out as if to touch her, but her hand fell short, hanging in the air between them. “It’s not… it’s not like that,” she murmured, her voice breaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t.” Agatha spat, slapping her hand from the air. Rio quirked an eyebrow at her, pressing her tongue into her cheek, but let her hand fall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t say it’s not like that when it is!” Agatha’s frustration boiled over, her heart racing with a mixture of anger and an undeniable longing. She stepped forward again, her fingers trembling with an energy that was raw and uncontainable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In a sudden surge of impulsive passion, Agatha reached out and grabbed the front of Rio’s shirt, pulling her closer. Before she could think better of it, she crashed her lips against Rio’s, pouring all her frustration, her hurt, and her longing into that single kiss. It was fierce, demanding, and full of desperation that she could no longer contain. It was a hungry beast now spiraling out of control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, time stood still. Agatha felt Rio’s body stiffen in surprise, her lips unyielding at first. But then, slowly, reluctantly, Rio responded, her hands finding their way to Agatha’s waist, drawing her closer as if trying to ground herself in the intensity of the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart raced as she pressed harder, deepening the kiss. She kissed her fiercely. She tasted the salt of her own tears as they slipped free, mingling with the heat between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Why couldn’t she just have been happy for her? Why was this passion being fueled by fury instead of the eager delight of returning to a lover? Why was she kissing Rio like she hated her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally broke apart, Agatha gasped for air, her chest heaving. She searched Rio’s eyes for understanding. “Tell me it matters,” she pleaded, her voice trembling. “Tell me this… whatever it is, matters.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her, her expression a storm of conflicting emotions. “Agatha…” she started, her voice shaky, but she faltered, unable to find the words. The vulnerability in her gaze flickered between fear and longing “You don’t know–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha interrupted, her voice fierce but laced with desperation. “I </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> know. I know I don’t want to hide from this, from you. You can’t go back to pretending that I’m some stranger you need to keep at a distance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitched, and for a moment, Agatha thought she might finally see the truth she had been searching for, but then Rio looked away, breaking the connection between them. The pain was evident in her voice. “You don’t understand what you’re asking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her heart sink, the weight of the world crashing back down around them. “I don’t want to understand anymore,” she admitted, her voice raw. “I want to feel. I want to be with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A heavy silence settled between them as Agatha fought against the rising tide of sorrow, feeling the familiar sting of rejection. She hated herself for wanting Rio. She hated that she couldn’t resist her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice broke. “Please.” She couldn’t stop the tears that were falling now. Her voice was begging, pleading in a way she didn’t recognize. “Please, don’t make me hate you, my love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Would it be easier on you if you did, </span>
<em>
<span>sweetheart</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio sneered. Her patience had run out. “I show concern for you, I tell you so clearly I care for you, and </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> is what makes you hate me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve told me </span>
<em>
<span>nothing</span>
</em>
<span>! Maybe if you did before we wouldn’t be like this right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes shone with hurt that quickly curled into anger. “Don’t you dare.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She spun on her heel to leave, but Agatha—desperate, wounded, feral Agatha— pushed her against the wall. “Look at me.” She grabbed Rio’s face, turning her jaw, forcing her to hold her stare. “Look at me, Rio.” She knew her eyes were crazed, she felt all the blood rushing to her face. She chewed her lip as she studied Rio, for what she wasn’t entirely sure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that how you want this, Agatha?” Rio asked coolly, her hand wrapping around Agatha’s wrist trying to coax her back from the edge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t give a fuck what I want,” she spat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was truly angry now. She drove her hands into the rock of the tunnel behind her and it exploded. They both were sent flying backward, crashing into the rubble. They struggled, scrambling and clawing at each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hit the ground hard but rolled quickly to her feet, adrenaline surging through her as she faced Rio. The rush of anger strengthened her. She lunged forward, her hands outstretched, not to summon magic, but to physically assert herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had barely regained her footing when Agatha tackled her, pushing her back against the jagged rock wall. They grappled, Agatha’s fingers digging into Rio’s shoulders as they struggled for control. “Why won’t you just let me in?” Agatha shouted, the words barely containing her rage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression flickered with surprise, but it quickly hardened into resolve. “You’re making this impossible, Agatha!” she cried, twisting free from Agatha’s grasp and shoving her back with a force that caught Agatha off guard. She stumbled but quickly regained her balance, eyes blazing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Impossible?” Agatha shouted, charging again. She threw a fist toward Rio, who dodged to the side with a fluid grace that when elsewhere applied had captivated Agatha. But this time, there was no allure in Rio’s movements; there was only a fierce determination to keep her at bay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, stop!” Rio barked, her voice echoing in the confined space. She aimed a kick at Agatha’s side, but Agatha twisted away just in time, countering with a swift jab to Rio’s midsection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were both breathing heavily now, emotions running high as they exchanged blows. Agatha felt the heat of their fight mix with the cool air of the tunnel, the space charged with an electric energy that crackled around them. “You don’t get to walk away from this!” Agatha yelled, throwing another punch, this one landing solidly against Rio’s jaw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stumbled back, surprise flashing across her face. She spat out blood to the ground at Agatha’s feet. Regaining her footing she rushed at Agatha, tackling her to the ground. They hit the dirt with a thud, and Agatha felt the breath leave her lungs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why can’t you see what this is doing to us?” Rio’s voice was strained as she pinned Agatha down, their faces mere inches apart. “I’m trying to protect you, and you’re—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Protect me?” Agatha hissed, pushing against Rio’s weight, but Rio held firm. “You think pushing me away will protect me? You’re only showing me that you don’t trust me!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression twisted, a mix of frustration and pain. “You’re not showing me that I </span>
<em>
<span>can</span>
</em>
<span> trust you!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sudden burst of strength, Agatha flipped them, putting herself on top. She pinned Rio’s wrists to the ground, her heart racing as she stared into Rio’s eyes. “Then tell me what you want, because I don’t want this,” she pleaded, her voice fierce but trembling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want you to understand the stakes!” Rio replied, her breath coming fast, anger still sparking in her gaze. “You think this is just about us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe it’s you who doesn’t understand!” Agatha shot back, frustration boiling over. She leaned closer, their breaths mingling. “I have fought so hard. I have changed so much. Why don’t you see me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression faltered for a moment before it hardened again. “You’re not the only one who’s changed, Agatha,” she said, her voice low and dangerous. “You’re walking a path I’m terrified of. I’m not scared of you. I’m scared </span>
<em>
<span>for</span>
</em>
<span> you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence hung between them, heavy with the weight of their unspoken feelings, the fight giving way to an uncomfortable truth. Inches from her face, Agatha could see the tears pricking at the corners of Rio’s eyes as she spoke again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I saw what you did to the coven. I’m not mad at you for doing what you needed to to survive. But seven well-known coven members were drained of their power and the eighth went missing. There are people out there who can put the pieces together. People who will hunt you down for what you’ve done.” Rio blinked back her tears but couldn’t keep the truth from spilling out. She realized she didn’t want to. If Agatha demanded the truth, she would have it. “So for six months, Agatha, I spent six months </span>
<em>
<span>terrified</span>
</em>
<span> of seeing you. Of being called up to collect a body and it turning out to be yours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes, wincing at Rio’s confession. She couldn’t look at Rio’s wounded face, she couldn’t live with the thought that she was the source of those tears. Another wave of hurt welled up inside her. She didn’t want this, didn’t want to feel so lost and torn apart. Agatha’s heart ached.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she let herself collapse, dropping her entire weight on top of Rio. She released her wrists and braced herself to be thrown aside. But a harsh touch didn’t come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Harshness would have been easier. She wasn’t prepared for the gentle caress of Rio’s hand threading through her hair. Agatha turned her head and rested it on Rio’s chest. She listened to the steady beat of her heart as Rio’s other hand softly rubbed her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry.” She whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Agatha repeated, looking up at her. Her brow furrowed as she noticed the bruise blooming on Rio’s jaw. An ugly mark she had caused. Her fingers skimmed it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flinched slightly but didn’t pull away, allowing Agatha’s fingers to trace the bruise with a gentleness that felt foreign after their fight. Agatha’s touch was tentative, as though she were trying to erase the damage she’d inflicted, to make sense of the pain she’d caused. Her fingertips lingered, soft and apologetic, and for a moment, the anger between them seemed to dissolve, leaving only the raw truth of what they’d both been holding back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does it hurt?” Agatha murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze softened, her guarded expression slipping. “Not as much as this,” she replied, brushing her fingers along Agatha’s cheek, where tears had left tracks. Her hand was steady, grounding, as though trying to hold Agatha together. “I never want this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lip quivered, and she pressed her face into Rio’s chest, the remnants of her anger dissolving into something softer, more vulnerable. “I know. I just… I didn’t know how else to show you. I thought if you could see what I’ve become, you’d—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do see you, Agatha.” Rio’s voice was gentle, a contrast to the tension that had existed only moments ago. “But I was afraid. Of losing you to this power you’ve claimed. I thought… if you grew so strong, so independent, maybe you’d never want to come back. I thought you’d be bored here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back, staring at her in disbelief. “You think I don’t want to come back? I wanted you to be proud, to see how much I’ve grown, and </span>
<em>
<span>all</span>
</em>
<span> I wanted was to share that with you. All of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression shifted, a hint of guilt and understanding flickering across her face. She reached up, brushing a stray lock of hair from Agatha’s face. “I am proud of you,” she said quietly, her voice breaking the silence between them. “I just was afraid of you outgrowing this—of outgrowing… me.” Rio’s hand stilled, her fingers resting against Agatha’s cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The weight of their fears hung between them, unspoken for so long, but finally laid bare. Agatha leaned in, pressing her forehead against Rio’s, and for a moment, they simply breathed together, grounding themselves in each other’s presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t have to be afraid anymore,” Agatha whispered. “Not like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes, exhaling slowly as her hand tightened gently in Agatha’s hair. “Then let’s start again,” she murmured, her voice low and earnest. “Let’s stop hurting each other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded against her chest and she felt Rio shift uncomfortably underneath her. “Anyway,” she said breezily, her usual teasing tone returning to her voice, “glad you’re here and all darling, but maybe we can kiss and make up not on bed of rubble?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, “Well if </span>
<em>
<span>someone</span>
</em>
<span> hadn’t been so dramatic blowing up a wall.” She stood and offered her hand to Rio, pulling her up with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m dramatic? You punched me! Who </span>
<em>
<span>does</span>
</em>
<span> that?” Rio snarked back. Agatha glanced quickly at her, still ashamed of how visceral their fight had been. But Rio’s eyes were playful as she reached up to her cheek healing the mark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, this whole time you could’ve healed yourself?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, yeah. Of course. But you know,” Rio shrugged as they continued down the tunnel, side by side, “sometimes you’ve got to let yourself feel the hurt.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed thoughtfully, leading them down the familiar paths back to her room. As they entered, her room was just as she’d left it. It felt so good to return to a familiar place. Coming home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, let’s put those healing hands to work then, I think you left a few bruises on me too.” She said, smiling at Rio mischievously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio quirked an eyebrow at her, not seeing any wounds on her body. “I don’t see—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, unbuttoning her shirt. “Oh I do, don’t you see just there?” she teased as she pulled her shirt off and pointed vaguely at her chest. “Why don’t you come closer and—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She laughed as Rio’s eyes brightened, catching her meaning, and hurried to tumble with her down onto the bed. “Won’t you be a <em>dear</em> and kiss it better?” She lilted, putting on a playful pout.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Who was Rio to deny anything from the woman she loved.</span>

<p>“You’re mad with power.” Rio teased, laughing as she leaned down to kiss Agatha. She pressed one hand over Agatha's heart as she did, supporting herself there long enough to brush her lips to her cheek as well.</p><p>That was an understatement. Agatha had been insatiable. A woman possessed with a singular focus on spending the night drawing as many orgasms as possible from her lover. Blame her competitive nature. Blame how hot Rio sounded when she threw her head back and gasped her name. How Rio looked like this, straddling her and looking down at her with a wolfish grin.</p><p>“No I’m not,” Agatha whined, pinching at Rio’s hips. “I just had a lot of time to myself for six months okay? Six months of just me and my imagination! And my left hand,” she teased wagging her fingers.</p><p>Rio’s laughter deepened, and her lips curled in that maddeningly teasing smile. “Oh, look at you,” she whispered, leaning down again, brushing her nose against Agatha’s. “Denying it just makes you look even more lust drunk.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, “And here I thought you <em>missed</em> me. But I can see you’re just here to make fun. And after how <em>generous</em> I’ve been…”</p><p>“Yes, yes, you’re a real saint darling.” Rio murmured, grinding her hips again, already on the way to seeking more from her. Agatha hummed in approval. “But this?” She leaned in, her voice warm and low. “This is even more fun.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, a soft, breathless sound, as she watched eagerly. “So that’s it, then? You thank me by teasing me half to death? I thought sainthood would get me more worship.”</p><p>“Half?” Rio raised an eyebrow, a sly glint in her eyes. “I’d say I’ve done more than that. Haven’t I? You’re all worked up… wound so tight, poor thing,” her voice was mocking as she reached down and pressed Agatha’s lip down with her thumb.</p><p>Agatha huffed, though she couldn’t keep a grin from slipping through. “I suppose you think you’re irresistible.” She propped herself up onto her elbows, leaning up and closer to her.</p><p>“Think?” Rio brushed her lips just shy of Agatha’s. “Oh, Agatha, I’m very confident in my charm.” She purred before kissing her deeply.</p><p>Agatha melted into the kiss, shifting all of her weight to one hand, she tangled the other into Rio’s hair pulling her even closer. They kissed until they were both breathless. When they pulled apart, her cheeks were flushed, and she couldn't help but roll her eyes at Rio's smirk.</p><p>"Confident, are we?" Agatha teased, catching her breath as she tucked a stray strand of Rio's hair behind her ear. "I seem to remember a time when you were so mysterious and broody and distant. Then you learned I’m <em> fantastic</em> in bed, and now you let me do whatever I want. So about my idea—"</p><p>Rio chuckled, feigning offense. "Please, I’ve always had the upper hand."</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, raising an eyebrow. "Oh? I distinctly recall you being the flustered one <em>several</em> times. Wasn't that <em>you</em> begging me ten minutes ago?"</p><p>Rio leaned closer, her hand tracing along Agatha's jaw, a teasing light in her gaze. "Maybe… just maybe, I let you think that," she murmured. </p><p>Agatha laughed, wrapping her arms around Rio’s shoulders. "Let me think it?" She leaned forward, brushing her lips close to Rio’s ear. "Or maybe you just couldn't help yourself. It sounded pretty desperate to me."</p><p>Rio shivered slightly, but the playful glint remained. "I’ll let you have that, just this once," she said, nipping softly at Agatha’s ear, sending a thrill through her. </p><p>"Good," Agatha whispered, her fingers sliding to rest at the nape of Rio's neck. "Because I <em> really</em> like getting my way,” she drew out her words, wagging her eyebrows meaningfully. “And I think you and I both would <em>really</em> enjoy it if you let me—”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes haughtily as she interrupted her, “<em>Fine! </em>We can try it.” She said with an annoyance she didn’t mean.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes lit up with delight, “You spoil me. Lay on your stomach,” she said eagerly, kissing Rio one more time for good measure and pinching her thigh before rolling them both into a new position.</p><hr/><p>“Do you… do you have some like… personal record you’re trying to break or something?” Rio panted into the pillow.</p><p>Agatha let out a sharp barking laugh as she rolled onto her side next to Rio, propping her head up on one hand as the other reached to brush away some of the sweaty hairs from the nape of the other woman’s neck.</p><p>“What can I say? You bring out my competitive streak.”</p><p>Rio huffed into the pillow, before reaching blindly to tangle their fingers together. “I really missed this,” she sighed.</p><p>Agatha smiled fondly and squeezed her hand twice. “Me too.” She felt like she was glowing. Not just from sex but from a deep warmth that spread through her as she gazed at the woman next to her. “I feel like I can breathe again.”</p><p>Rio chuckled before scooting closer to her, nuzzling her nose at the hollow of Agatha’s throat. She was still coming down, her breaths still ragged, her body an overstimulated live wire. “That makes one of us.” She pressed a kiss to her neck before tapping Agatha’s hip. “Roll over, I want to hold you for a while.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and obliged, scooting back against Rio, sighing as strong arms wrapped around her, their legs tangling together.</p><p>They settled into the quiet warmth of the room, a comfortable silence wrapping around them. Agatha felt Rio’s breath steady against her neck, her arms tight but gentle. Holding her so protectively, as if she was afraid if she loosened her grasp Agatha would slip away again. She traced lazy circles on Rio’s forearm, savoring the closeness. </p><p>After a few moments, Agatha tilted her head back, glancing at Rio over her shoulder. “So, I've been meaning to ask, what did <em>you </em> get up to while I was gone? Anything exciting?” </p><p>Rio gave a dry chuckle, rubbing her thumb over Agatha’s stomach. "Exciting? Hardly. I spent most of it just keeping things in order. You know how it is. That plague in Dublin took up a good four months. I kept myself busy.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, thinking of how those weeks must have dragged on for Rio, without anyone to talk to. "I mean, up there I would occasionally bump into someone. Traveling merchant, an occasional band of misfits lost in the woods. Sure, it wasn’t you, but… I could find occasional company.” She hesitated, wondering if her words might cut too close. “Did you… was there anyone here you could talk to?”</p><p>Rio’s hand paused for a moment before resuming its gentle rhythm. "Not really," she admitted, her voice quieter. "I don’t… make it a habit. The souls here are, preoccupied. Plus I can't give special treatment. I guess I just never really needed anyone down here."</p><p>A small pang twisted in Agatha’s chest. She realized, with a bit of sadness, that Rio truly didn’t have anyone else.</p><p>Rio let out a sigh, pulling Agatha a little closer, as if to hide in her warmth. “It’s never even been something I’ve… wanted, not until you.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart squeezed at that, her throat tightening. "So all this time, it was just… me?" she whispered, her voice barely audible.</p><p>“Yes, just you,” Rio replied softly, a hint of vulnerability slipping through. “And you… you were up there.” Her fingers stilled against Agatha’s side. “I didn’t realize until you were gone how quiet it would be.”</p><p>Agatha turned slightly in Rio’s arms, just enough to see her face. “I’m here now. And I’ll keep coming back.”</p><p>Rio’s face softened, but there was a faint shadow in her eyes like she wasn’t sure if she could trust the promise. She looked away, a small smile tugging at her lips. “You’d be the first,” she said, half-teasing, but Agatha heard the echo of loneliness there, something she doubted Rio would ever admit out loud.</p><p>Agatha took Rio’s hand and brought it to her lips, pressing a gentle kiss there. “Then I’ll just have to be the one who breaks all your rules.” She looked up, holding Rio’s gaze with steady conviction. “If you’ll let me.”</p><p>Rio’s lips quirked, her grip tightening around Agatha’s fingers. “I suppose I’ll allow an exception,” she murmured, her voice laced with something soft, something almost hopeful.</p><p>They stayed like that, wrapped up in each other, and for the first time, Agatha sensed that Rio was allowing herself to lean into that hope—into the idea that maybe she wasn’t alone anymore. She drifted off easily in Rio's arma and slept more soundly than she had in half a year.</p><p>When she woke up, she realized that Rio was still there with her and she felt a wave of affection rush through her. Agatha brushed her hair out of her eyes, grinning mischievously as she watched Rio stretch out beside her, looking relaxed and slightly amused as she noticed Agatha’s good mood. </p><p>"So," Agatha began with an air of playful formality, "In making up for lost time, and because you were <em>such a good sport</em> last night, I’ve decided to take you on a date."</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, feigning surprise. “Oh?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, eyes sparkling. “Courtship is an intricate ritual,” she said in mock seriousness</p><p>A wry smile crept over Rio’s face. “Hmm, I seem to remember a certain someone skipping a few steps. Aren’t you supposed to court someone before… repeatedly falling into bed with them?”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed, and she couldn’t hold back a chuckle. “Minor details,” she replied, waving a hand dismissively. “It’s never too late to start, right? Besides,” she added more softly, “don’t you think it would be fun?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, something more tender settling in her expression as she took Rio’s hand. There was something almost heartbreaking about the thought that, for all her years, Rio may have never really had this sort of experience—a night meant just for her. </p><p>“You’d be the first excited for a date with death.” Rio said with a wry smile.</p><p>“Seems I’m the first at a lot of things with you hot stuff.” Agatha teased with a roguish and over-exaggerated wink, laughing as Rio threw a pillow at her.</p><hr/><p>Agatha was meticulous, more so than she’d ever been with spells or training. She wanted this to be perfect, to give Rio something that felt special—a night that could belong to just them, untouched by the shadows and secrets that hung over so much of their past time together.</p><p>She had combed the underworld’s dim gardens for hours, gathering flowers with a careful eye for those that seemed to glow most brightly in the soft, blue-tinted light of the underworld. In the garden under the branches of the willow tree, Agatha arranged a spread of cushions and blankets she’d pilfered from her chambers—deep purples, silvers, and soft grays that seemed to echo the colors of the underworld itself. She set a careful bundle of dried herbs nearby, hoping to mask the ever-present, earthy dampness with a sweeter scent that would linger as they relaxed. She’d conjured a small spread—a blend of the underworld’s fruits and flask of wine she’d gathered during her time above ground.</p><p>When she heard footsteps approaching, she felt a rush of nervous excitement. She hadn’t seen Rio since morning and wondered if her little surprise would live up to her expectations. Taking a deep breath, she glanced around, reassuring herself that everything was in place.</p><p>As Rio approached, her eyes widened slightly, and a smirk tugged at her lips. “Well, you certainly went all out,” she murmured, a flicker of surprise brightening her gaze.</p><p>Agatha grinned, her cheeks flushed with a mix of pride and bashfulness. “Well, I’m trying to do this properly,” she replied, gesturing to the cushions and leading Rio to sit with her against them.</p><p>Rio’s expression softened as she glanced around the garden, her gaze lingering on the flowers Agatha had gathered. “It’s, very sweet,” she admitted, “Most people wouldn’t be able to… draw beauty out of this place.”</p><p>Agatha beamed a mischievous glint in her eye. “Most people don’t have you to impress,” she teased. She uncorked the dark, earthy wine and handed it to Rio, who took it with an amused raise of her brow.</p><p>As they settled into a comfortable silence, Agatha reached out to touch one of the Shadeblooms she’d woven into a makeshift garland nearby. “I don’t think you’ve ever mentioned it, but… do you ever spend much time out here, like this? When I’m not here,” she asked, curiosity sparking in her voice.</p><p>Rio leaned back, letting her gaze drift over the soft lights and shadows around them. “Not often. I used to, maybe, when I was younger,” she admitted, her voice low. “But there was never anyone else here to enjoy it with.” </p><p>The words hung in the air, soft and sad, and Agatha felt a pang in her chest. She knew, intellectually, that Rio’s life had been isolated, but seeing it spelled out like this brought the reality of it home in a new way. “Well,” she said softly, her hand finding Rio’s and squeezing it, “I’m glad we get to enjoy it together now.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, and at that moment, Agatha could see something close to awe in her eyes, like she couldn’t quite believe this moment.</p><p>“I don’t know how you do it, Agatha,” Rio murmured, her fingers brushing over Agatha’s. “Making this place feel less… hollow.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, a little shy but certain. “Maybe that’s my real magic.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “You're laying it on a bit thick, no? Shmaltz, I think that’s what they call it?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged her shoulders and leaned in closer, noticing how the wine had darkened Rio’s lips. “Call it what you want. Is it working?”</p><p>Rio’s smirk softened into something warmer as she leaned forward, letting their noses brush together. “Maybe,” she murmured. “You’ll have to keep trying if you want a definitive answer.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, sitting back with a flourish, her arm sweeping dramatically through the air. “Very well, then,” she announced, voice lilting and playful. “For my next trick…” She leapt up and extended her hand to Rio with an exaggerated bow, her eyes gleaming with mischief. “May I have this dance?”</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow, looking at Agatha’s outstretched hand. “Are you planning to just pretend there’s music?” She asked dryly.</p><p>Agatha grinned, undeterred. “Do we <em> need </em> music?” She tilted her head, batting her eyelashes in a melodramatic, mock-innocent way. Rio rolled her eyes again before standing and brushing away the leaves that clung to her.</p><p>Agatha grinned and pulled Rio close to her. “So, come here often?” she asked, as if they were strangers meeting in a dim, moonlit corner for the first time.</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh, the sound filling the quiet space. “Oh, is <em> that</em> your opening line? Pretty bold.”</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha countered, crossing her arms in mock offense. “I’ve been practicing that one. I think it’s rather charming.” </p><p>"Well, in that case… how could I resist?”</p><p>Agatha stepped close, resting her hand on Rio’s waist, her other hand securely in Rio’s grasp. They began to sway, a gentle, unhurried rhythm as they circled one another in the dim light. The Shadeblooms cast a silvery glow around them, their soft petals swaying as if dancing, too.</p><p>Rio chuckled, glancing around them with a playful shake of her head. “You think we really don’t need any music then, do we?”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, her lips hovering close to Rio’s ear. “Not with you. But if you've got the lost souls of a four piece band milling about here <em>do</em> let me know. For next time.”</p><p>They continued to sway, slowly and softly, Agatha’s fingers tracing gentle patterns along Rio’s shoulder. The teasing melted into something quiet and tender as they moved together, breaths syncing, their laughter fading into soft smiles.</p><p>Rio let her head rest on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>As they moved together, Rio felt a still unaccustomed warmth settle over her, threading its way through her defenses. Agatha was pressed close, her laughter quiet but bright, her fingers soft where they laced through Rio’s own. There was no music, no rhythm but the quiet pulse of the underworld's machinery around them. And yet, in Agatha’s arms, Rio found herself lost in something she’d never thought she could want, let alone need.</p><p>She let herself look at Agatha—the way her eyes sparkled, the way she’d gone to such lengths to create this small, beautiful moment. It was such a simple gesture, but in its simplicity, it was more profound than anything Rio had experienced in centuries. Agatha’s fingers grazed her cheek as she moved, and Rio felt herself pull closer, her heart rising unbidden.</p><p>The realization was sudden, almost startling. This wasn’t just attachment, or admiration, or even infatuation. The word that lingered on her tongue, the one she’d never dared let herself consider, was <em>love </em>. It filled her with a longing she didn’t know how to put into words, a desire to meet Agatha’s vulnerability with her own. In that instant, Rio saw herself reflected in Agatha’s eyes, and it was as if her defenses melted away, leaving only her raw, unguarded self.</p><p>
<em> The bearer of last breaths had found herself craving the beating heart of another. </em>
</p><p>It was a thought that might once have terrified her, might have driven her to retreat, to push Agatha away. But tonight, it filled her with wonder. She wanted to tell her—to let Agatha know, without the usual reservations, that she had somehow woven herself into Rio’s very soul.</p><p>Rio felt another pulse of warmth unfurling within her, battling against the coolness of her usual stoicism. The laughter, the teasing moments, and the intimate glances they’d shared over the evening coalesced into something undeniable, something deep and wild that she had tried to cage for too long. </p><p>With each gentle turn, she pulled Agatha closer, the rhythm of their hearts syncing in a dance that felt both old and new. The world around them dimmed, fading into the background, leaving only the sound of their breaths mingling in the quiet night.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio began, her voice barely above a whisper as she spun them into a dip, holding her steady. She met Agatha’s gaze, those vibrant eyes filled with a mixture of curiosity and anticipation. “I need to tell you something.” </p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed slightly, but there was no trace of fear in her expression—only the kind of trust that made Rio's heart ache. “What is it?” she prompted, concern etched in her features.</p><p>Rio raised her back to standing and cupped her cheek with her hand.</p><p>“I’ve never… I’ve never really let anyone in,” Rio admitted, the confession spilling out before she could second-guess herself. “You know how I am, how I’ve always kept my distance. Even from you.” </p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, her breath hitching as she sensed the weight of Rio’s words. “But…”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, steadying herself. “But you’ve made me want to change that. You’ve made this place feel less like a tomb and more like a home.” She hesitated, her heart racing. “I’m not good at this, at being vulnerable, but... I think I might be falling for you, Agatha.”</p><p>The admission hung in the air, fragile yet potent. Rio felt her chest constrict as she fought against the surge of emotions flooding her, fighting against the instinct to retreat back into her guarded shell. </p><p>Agatha's eyes widened, shimmering with surprise, and in that moment, Rio knew she had revealed more than just her feelings. She had laid bare the truth of her heart, and all that remained was to see how Agatha would respond to this leap of faith.</p><p>“<em>Oh.</em> I think that’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard.” Agatha breathed out, voice full of awe.</p><p>Rio's breath caught in her throat as Agatha’s earnest words washed over her, a soft balm against her fear. The tension in her chest began to ease, replaced by something warm and radiant that spread through her like sunlight breaking through clouds.</p><p>“Really?” Rio asked, her voice barely above a whisper, searching Agatha’s face for any hint of doubt.</p><p>“Really,” Agatha affirmed, her smile blooming bright and full of life. “You don’t know how long I’ve wanted to hear that from you.”</p><p>Rio’s heart soared, but a small flutter of uncertainty still lingered. “But I’m not... I’m not exactly” she trailed off, a hint of hesitation creeping into her voice. “I mean I’m the embodiment of death, Agatha.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Agatha replied, her tone light and teasing. “You’re a literal goddess of the underworld. I’m punching <em> way </em> up!” She leaned in, her forehead resting against Rio’s. Seriously, she whispered, “I want all of you, even the parts that make you nervous.”</p><p>The sincerity in Agatha’s gaze melted away the last of Rio’s reservations. With a soft chuckle, she tucked a loose strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear. “You really <em>are</em> mad, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Madly in love,” Agatha corrected, her voice laced with affection.</p><p>Rio grinned, the tension melting away as they swayed in the dim light. “Then we’ll go mad together,” she murmured, leaning down to capture Agatha’s lips in a soft kiss. It was tender, electric, and filled with a promise of the journey they were walking together.</p><p>As they pulled away, Agatha’s eyes sparkled with mischief. “So, what’s next for us, oh mighty goddess? More dancing under the stars? Maybe a ghostly string quartet? Dancing on top of a grave? Scandalous!” She stuck her tongue out, biting it between her teeth.</p><p>Rio laughed, her heart light. “How about we start with something a little less ambitious? Just you, me, and a good bottle of wine.” She lowered them both to sit again under the tree.</p><p>Agatha beamed, her smile radiant as she snuggled closer, resting her head on Rio’s shoulder. “I like that plan.”</p><p>Together, they embraced the stillness of the night, the shadows around them fading into a canvas painted with the beginnings of something beautiful—a scene of love between a human and a goddess, bound by their shared spark and the promise of more to come.</p><p>The veil lifted from between them, their feelings and hearts laid bare... Agatha felt a certain steady feeling wash over her. Nothing would come between this.</p><p>She would not allow it.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Every day Agatha grew more comfortable in the place she now called home.</p><p>Hidden in the shadows, Rio watched as Agatha held court in her own quiet way, communing wordlessly with the souls that lingered around her. They approached Agatha with a kind of reverence Rio had rarely seen, though the dead could not speak their faces open and grateful, as if Agatha was a warm fire in the heart of the Underworld’s cold and endless night. </p><p>Rio’s fingers clenched at her sides. Kindness, she thought, wouldn’t get these souls anywhere. This was the Underworld, a place built on the edge of desolation and despair; her strength was what kept it in line. Her command. For centuries, fear and order had been her tools, not soft words or gentle reassurances. Yet here were her subjects, her workers, drawn to Agatha as if she could offer them something Rio never could.</p><p>Agatha looked up and caught sight of her in the shadows. For a moment, her face shone with a startled awe, and then something softer, almost like gentle defiance. Pushing her boundaries. She whispered a parting word to the souls around her and moved toward Rio with a warm, familiar smile.</p><p>“You don’t have to lurk, you know,” Agatha teased, her voice light as she closed the distance between them. “I don’t bite.”</p><p>Rio forced a smile, though her jaw was tight. “Maybe you should, with the way they follow you.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, taken aback by the sharpness of her words. She tilted her head, studying Rio’s expression. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed, the words bubbling up before she could stop them. “Nothing you need to worry about.”</p><p>The irritation in her tone was unmistakable, and she regretted it the moment it left her lips. But she couldn’t quite swallow down the frustration, the unsettling feeling that everything she had built was shifting beneath her.</p><p>Agatha searched her face, her smile fading. “Rio… if I’ve done something—”</p><p>Rio cut her off, unable to hold back. “Do you think kindness is enough to keep this place in line, Agatha? These souls need strength, they need fear to survive here. What you’re doing… it isn’t going to help them.”</p><p>Agatha’s face softened, though there was an edge to her eyes now, something stubborn and steady. “Strength and fear have their place,” she said, voice quiet but unwavering. “But sometimes, people need to know there’s more than that. That there’s something to hope for.”</p><p>Rio felt a strange, piercing twist in her chest at Agatha’s words, and it took everything she had not to retreat, to shield herself behind her carefully built walls. She looked away, her pride too sharp to admit how threatened she felt, how much she feared the growing light Agatha cast on her world—a light that made her own shadows loom larger than ever.</p><p>After a tense silence, Rio forced herself to look back at Agatha. “I don’t need hope to rule here,” she muttered, the frustration still pulsing beneath her words. “And neither do they. I give them work, I give them purpose. Trying to remind them of their past… I don’t think that’s a kindness. I think it’s twisting the knife.”</p><p>Agatha held her gaze, unflinching. For a moment, Rio thought she might argue, might push back with that quiet conviction that both infuriated and fascinated her. But instead, Agatha only reached out, resting a hand on Rio’s arm, her touch gentle and grounding.</p><p>“Maybe so,” she murmured. “But I’m here. And while I am… maybe it’s worth trying to reach them.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened, caught between her pride at her resolve and a faint shade of jealousy. She pulled her arm away, though the touch lingered like an ember beneath her skin.</p><p>“Do what you like,” she said coolly, before turning on her heel. But as she walked away, she felt Agatha’s eyes on her, and for the first time, she wondered if her world could survive a heart softened by love.</p><p>She paused a second, and took a deep breath. Perhaps she was being too harsh. People needed community. You couldn’t get everything from one person. Well, most people couldn’t, she only had one other soul that truly captivated her, but Agatha was exceptional. She was still wary of Agatha’s influence but if it was companionship that her love was looking for, maybe she could redirect her to a more suitable target.</p><p>After a moment’s hesitation, Rio glanced back at Agatha, who was still watching her, waiting with that same patient gaze. The pull between them felt too tense, and Rio, unsure of how to untangle it, took a deep breath and forced a lightness into her tone. </p><p>“Since you seem so keen on company,” she began, her voice deliberately nonchalant, “there’s… someone I think you should meet.” </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, her interest piqued. “Someone?”  </p><p>Rio nodded, a faint smirk tugging at her lips. “Or rather… something.” She gestured for Agatha to follow, and, with a lingering glance, Agatha fell into step beside her as they walked deeper into the Underworld, down winding paths lined with shadowed trees and jagged rock formations. </p><p>As they approached a clearing, Rio stopped, her gaze sharpening. “Cerberus,” she called, her voice echoing through the cavernous space, commanding and steady. She whistled lowly.</p><p>There was a deep rumble, like thunder rolling through the earth, and a massive figure stepped out of the shadows. Agatha’s eyes widened as she took in the three-headed hound, each head watching her with an intensity that was both terrifying and awe-inspiring. Cerberus’ fur was a dark rippling black, eyes glowing red and yellow, his posture both imposing and regal.</p><p>“Meet Cerberus,” Rio said, her voice filled with a strange mix of pride and reverence. “He’s been by my side since I first took the throne. He guards the boundaries, keeping the lost souls in check.” </p><p>Agatha took a tentative step forward, her eyes wide with wonder. “He’s… incredible.”</p><p>Cerberus sniffed the air, then took a step closer, his middle head lowering to inspect her. Agatha held still, meeting the creature’s gaze without flinching, and after a moment, the hound let out a soft chuff, his heads turning to Rio as if seeking her approval. Rio watched the exchange with a faint smile, feeling an unexpected warmth as she saw Agatha’s awe.</p><p>“He’s not used to visitors,” Rio said softly, stepping forward to lay a hand on Cerberus’ massive shoulder. “But I thought you might appreciate his company. A little… distraction from the lost souls, perhaps?”</p><p>Agatha looked over at Rio, understanding the offer behind the words. “Thank you,” she said quietly, reaching out to let Cerberus sniff her hand before giving him a gentle scratch behind his ear. One of the hound’s heads closed its eyes, leaning into her touch with a rumbling sigh, and Agatha laughed softly. “He’s a sweetheart, isn’t he?” </p><p>Rio chuckled, a low, rare sound. “Sweetheart isn’t the word I’d use. But he’s loyal. And he’s powerful. Qualities I can rely on.”</p><p>Agatha glanced over at her, a softness in her gaze. “It sounds like you’re talking about someone else besides the dog.”</p><p>Rio’s smirk faded, a flicker of vulnerability passing over her face before she masked it. She reached up to scratch Cerberus’ head, her gaze averted. “He’s a reminder that strength doesn’t need… many words to be effective,” she muttered, but even as she said it, she felt a pang of doubt.</p><p>Agatha didn’t push, but she moved closer, her hand brushing against Rio’s. “Maybe it doesn’t,” she murmured. “But loyalty and strength don’t have to come from fear, Rio. Sometimes, they come from love.”</p><p>Rio tensed, her chest tightening as she looked away, back toward the shadows. But even as she did, Cerberus leaned against Agatha, nudging her hand with a low, contented huff, as though he had already chosen his side.</p><p>She sighed and deflected, trying to control the conversation. “Well, I know he’d like some more company. He gets antsy like his mama sometimes.” She laughed, as if to prove her point, Cerberus licked Agatha, his massive tongue lolling from her hand all the way up her arm and face.</p><p>Agatha laughed despite herself and scratched under his chin. “That’s okay… maybe like his mama he just needs a firm hand on his leash,” she teased, eyes sparkling mischievously.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p>A distraction, for now. But it wouldn’t last.</p><hr/><p>Rio had seethed with rage when she found a few shades lingering in the garden, in <em>their</em> garden, their sacred space. They had abandoned their duties, curiously following Agatha to this place. She stormed into the space, magic crackling at her fingertips as she lashed out with a sickly green bolt of energy. “Out!  All of you! You have work to do.” She hissed, a grim satisfaction passing over her as the souls rushed away.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said softly, realizing her lover’s temper was short today. “You didn’t need to do that. They were just keeping me company.”</p><p>Another silence. The faintest flicker of impatience crossed Rio’s face, and then her gaze snapped to Agatha, sharp and accusing. “They followed you to this place like they thought they could. Like they are an equal, like they get the same privileges you do. You do realize what that means, don’t you?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, thrown by the accusation in her tone. “What are you talking about? Rio, I’m just… I’m just trying to give them a space to rest. I’m not trying to take anything from you.”</p><p>Rio scoffed, turning away. “But you are, without even meaning to. They flock to you now, they pay attention to you. They look to you—and not to me.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha stepped forward, her voice soft, trying to soothe the bitterness she could see building in Rio’s eyes. “They still respect you—”</p><p>“Do they?” Rio’s voice rose, bitter and biting. “They look at you like you’re some guiding light, some warmth they’ve never known here. You’ve become a balm, a distraction. And now they’re beginning to question me, to question the very way this realm was built. They’re questioning what they’re doing here. And it’s not something they have a choice in. I give them jobs because if their minds aren’t occupied they start to think of everything up there, everything that they’re missing, it will drive them insane. It will change them, and not in the way you’re hoping!”</p><p>Agatha felt the words hit her like a cold wind, and she struggled to find a response that would steady Rio’s fears. “I didn’t… I didn’t mean to change anything. I was only trying to bring them some peace.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed, her voice lowering to a harsh whisper. “And by doing so, you’ve taken more than you know.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened, the weight of Rio’s words pressing on her heart. She could see the hurt buried beneath Rio’s frustration, but reaching it felt like stepping through fire. “Rio… please, let me help—”</p><p>But Rio’s pride flared, and she pulled away, retreating further into herself. “I don’t need your help,” she said coldly, her voice closing like a door. “Maybe you should save your kindness for the souls who you seem to think need it more than I do.”</p><p>Without another word, she turned and left, her footsteps echoing through the empty space, leaving Agatha alone.</p><p>Agatha felt the chill left in Rio’s wake, the weight of what was happening settling onto her shoulders. She realized that this rift could not be mended easily.</p><p>But Agatha also knew that this anger was personal to Rio. She knew that in her way, the woman was trying to help them make the most of their situation. They just had different ways of going about it. Misaligned perspectives tied to the intrinsic truth that only one of them had lived experiences of human life. </p><p>She would let Rio cool off a little bit. They were getting better at handling conflict. She had learned that with time she could usually bring Rio around to her point of view. It was a truth she wielded delicately though.</p><hr/><p>Some time later, Agatha found Rio lounging in a comfortable chair inside Agatha’s room. She approached slowly, careful not to startle Rio, who sat with her arms crossed tightly, her gaze fixed on some distant, invisible point.</p><p>But Agatha took solace in the fact that Rio wanted to be found. If not she wouldn’t be in Agatha’s room, occupying her favorite chair. Sulking, granted, but here. </p><p>Agatha took a soft breath, then crossed the threshold, coming to perch on the arm of the chair next to her. For a moment, she tried to think of something to say that would cut through the heavy air, something to make her smile, even just a little. She leaned closer, raising an eyebrow, her mouth tilting into a tentative grin.</p><p>“Would it be weird if I tried to make you laugh?” she murmured, nudging her shoulder gently. “I know, it’s a tall order, but I’ve heard I can be pretty charming.”</p><p>Rio gave a small huff, the tiniest ghost of a smile tugging at the corner of her mouth, but she didn’t respond. Her arms stayed crossed, her defenses carefully in place.</p><p>Agatha’s heart clenched, but she swallowed her own pride and reached for Rio’s hand, folding her fingers over hers. Her voice dropped to a whisper. “You’re still their queen, and no one can replace you.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened, her eyes flicking to Agatha’s hand. “They’re not seeing me that way anymore, Agatha. And that’s because of you.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, the truth settling uncomfortably between them. She wanted to reassure her, to deny it, but the words wouldn’t come. Because, deep down, she knew Rio was right. Every time she extended a hand to the Underworld’s people, she felt her own purpose deepen. And with each of those moments, she felt a subtle shift, a slow but certain pull, as if her very presence here was drawing Rio’s people away from her, one by one.</p><p>“I didn’t mean for any of this to happen,” Agatha murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. “I don’t want to fight. I don’t want to upset you. I only wanted to help.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said, but there was a sadness in her tone, a resignation that felt like an ache in the air between them. She ran a hand through her hair and poked her tongue into her cheek. “You’re changing things, Agatha. And I… I don’t know if I like it. I don’t know if I even understand it.”</p><p>Frustrated as she was though, Rio couldn’t stay truly mad for long. She had fallen in love with a human heart, she couldn’t fairly expect her to act against it. She sighed before moving her hand to Agatha’s waist, pulling her into her lap. “Come here. You know I hate it when you hover,” she grumbled.</p><p>Agatha looped her arms around Rio’s neck as she settled against her. She allowed the silence to stretch for a moment longer, the weight of it grounding her as leaned against Rio. But then, ever so carefully, she let a small smile play at her lips, her tone shifting to something lighter, teasing.</p><p>“Well,” she murmured, turning so her gaze could catch Rio’s, brushing her nose against her jaw, “you’re still my queen, you know. And I… I can be a very loyal subject.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows lifted, but her expression remained guarded, skepticism mingling with a faint intrigue. Agatha leaned closer, lips ghosting over Rio’s ear, as she played with her hair. She lifted Rio’s hand and placed it at the collar of her shirt, a clear invitation.</p><p>“Your most loyal,” Agatha whispered, her voice soft, almost reverent. “If that’s what you need from me.” She gently bit Rio’s earlobe. “I can be <em>very</em> giving.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flickered, her walls wavering for just a moment. Agatha saw it—the crack, small but unmistakable—and she felt the ache of wanting to be let in, to help shoulder Rio’s burdens.</p><p>“Think of it as an… offering,” Agatha continued her voice playful now, with a gleam in her eyes. “You’re used to calling all the shots around here, aren’t you? But not with us. Not when you’re with me. And as much as my ego loves bringing death to her knees… Maybe you need that outlet… Let me show you just how devoted I can be.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze narrowed, her pride and wariness caught between skepticism and intrigue. Agatha could see her thinking, weighing the offer. She held her gaze, unwavering, letting her know she meant it. If Rio needed that control, needed that reassurance of who she was in her own domain, Agatha would willingly offer it to her.</p><p>“Do you trust me?” Agatha asked her tone light but with a thread of seriousness beneath.</p><p>Rio studied her for a long moment before her lips finally curved, the smallest hint of a smirk breaking through. “Are you saying you’re at my mercy?” she asked, her voice low and almost taunting.</p><p>Rio’s hand trailed to the top button of Agatha’s shirt and slipped it out of place. Agatha knew her tells now. She could see the faint blush growing around her cheeks. She could feel Rio tensing beneath her like a beast ready to pounce. Just a little more.</p><p>“If that’s what you need,” Agatha replied, her own smile widening. “For tonight, I’m yours to command.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze turned contemplative, dark, and hungry with want. Her fingers paused on Agatha’s shirt, her smirk deepening as her gaze flicked back up, sharp and analyzing. "An offering, hmm?” Her voice held a note of mock contemplation, a teasing lilt that had Agatha’s heart racing. “Or maybe this is just another way for you to hold the reins, keep me right where you want me."</p><p>Agatha’s brow arched a playful challenge sparking in her eyes. "You think I’m that calculating?"</p><p>Rio’s smirk widened, her voice lowering to a murmur as she leaned in. "I <em>know</em> you’re always calculating, Agatha. You never give anything up easily. Offering me control just like that?" She laughed softly, but there was a thrill behind it. "Feels a little suspicious, don’t you think?"</p><p>Agatha could feel Rio’s breath against her skin, the thrill of the game charging the air between them. "Maybe I’m just showing my cards,” Agatha murmured, letting her voice dip, feigning innocence but her eyes giving away more. “Or maybe…” Her gaze held steady, a small, defiant smile tugging at her lips. “Maybe I want you to take it from me.”</p><p>Rio’s grip tightened, her smile shifting into something more predatory. "Oh, so that’s it. You want me to seize it.” She tilted her head as if genuinely considering. "That’s a lot to offer up."</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, but she kept her tone steady, matching Rio’s teasing intensity. "So… will you?"</p><p>Rio held her gaze, her fingers skimming down to take Agatha’s hand and raise it to her lips, the brush of her mouth both soft and unyielding. “You’d <em>like</em> that, wouldn’t you," she murmured, her voice low, daring.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip and squirmed a bit in Rio’s lap. “What if I say please?” she asked, affecting her voice with an over the top sweetness.</p><p>Rio laughed, a sharp edge creeping into her voice, “<em>Sweetheart</em>,” she drawled, making a mockery of her pet name, “it’s adorable that you think that bargaining has any place here. That you’re going to get to <em>choose</em> whether you beg me or not.”</p><p>Agatha shivered at the thrill that passed for her and she whined needily, dipping her head to try and kiss Rio’s neck. She hissed, caught between pain and pleasure, as Rio’s hand pulled her back by her hair sharply.</p><p>“You’re mine Agatha,” Rio growled, a dangerous note in her voice. “I think you’ve forgotten that. Everything, and everyone, in the Underworld I <em>own</em>.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help the moan that left her as she tried to nod but found her head still held firm.</p><p>“Say it.” Rio demanded. She rose out of the chair, pushing Agatha to stand with her. She kept Agatha’s head drawn back, her neck exposed. She watched the woman’s throat bob as she swallowed thickly.</p><p>But Agatha, proud defiant Agatha didn’t speak. Rio didn’t know whose benefit that was for. She loved the challenge all the same.</p><p>“Agatha,” she warned, her hand moving to Agatha’s throat. She held her firmly, not applying more pressure yet, just adding a layer of threat. Agatha’s eyes were blown wide as she panted slightly, her lips parted. But her lover was a stubborn thing. Rio loved her for that, it would only make this more fun. Yes, this was exactly what she needed. <em>Clever girl.</em></p><p>“Nothing to say… that’s certainly a first. But fine. Have it your way.” Rio’s words came out eerily calm. Agatha raised her eyebrow in confusion, and Rio took the opportunity to catch her off guard. She shoved Agatha roughly, at the same time sweeping her leg behind Agatha, sending her tumbling to the ground.</p><p>Agatha gasped as she hit the floor. Her eyes were wild as she looked up at Rio. But before she could scramble back to her feet, she felt her body seize and freeze sprawled out here on the floor. A binding spell. Her eyes flashed in surprise, she didn’t know Rio had it in her. To use her magic against her like this. To leave her completely powerless. </p><p>Rio stalked over to her, standing above her now as she considered Agatha’s helpless position. Agatha watched as Rio lifted her boot before pressing the toe of it against her chest. If she weren’t bound she would’ve grabbed her by the ankle and pulled her to the floor with her. Taken back her power. Flipped them and thoroughly put Rio in her place. But she wasn’t able to do that. Not now. The thought drove her crazy with excitement.</p><p>Rio’s commanding sneer softened for a moment before she tilted her head slightly. “Comfortable?” Rio asked. Agatha realized that she was giving her an out. Allowing her to back out of this power game. But Agatha couldn’t refuse a challenge. She licked her lips and nodded up at Rio.</p><p>“Never better,” she shot back, testing the strength of the magic that held her. But it, like the boot pressing against her, held firm.</p><p>“Good girl.” Rio purred, before stepping away and beginning to remove her own clothes. Agatha watched hungrily, and with a bit of jealousy. She loved undressing Rio, those should be her hands on her, her fingers clenched with muscle memory.</p><p>“Rio, let me help.” Agatha gasped, straining her head upward. “Please, I want to—”</p><p>“Ah ah ah.” Rio chided, now naked and moving to straddle her hips. Agatha groaned as she felt Rio against her, her desire already hot against Agatha’s skin. There was no question her lover was already enjoying this.</p><p>“I gave you the opportunity to ask for what you wanted.” Rio rolled her hips against Agatha and moaned, reaching up to palm her own breast as she grinned devilishly down at the bound woman.</p><p>“Please, I want to touch you. Let me do that. You know it’s better when—”</p><p>Rio roughly pressed two fingers into Agatha’s mouth, and Agatha’s pleading was cut off as she moaned around them.</p><p>“No.” Rio said firmly, pressing down against Agatha’s tongue. “You’re not talking now. I don’t need your words.”</p><p>Agatha whimpered again but nodded. She didn’t know if she’d ever been this turned on in her life. Whatever she wants. I will give this woman anything she wants. She thought, letting her tongue curl over Rio’s fingers.</p><p>Rio ground her hips against her again before removing her fingers, wiping them roughly against Agatha’s face. “You’re mine, Agatha. Last chance. Tell me. ”</p><p>“I’m yours!” Agatha gasped, staring desperately up at Rio. “Please. Please. Anything you want,” she begged, no longer caring about keeping her proud composure. This new game was much more exciting than the one she had started. </p><p>“See? That wasn’t so hard was it dear? You’re so pretty when you’re pathetic and needy like this,” Rio cooed, shifting on her knees as she moved her hips higher up Agatha’s body. “That’s all I wanted to hear. Now I want you to prove it.”</p><p>She lowered herself to Agatha’s lips, and the brush of her tongue against her clit was enough to break her focus on the binding ritual.</p><p>Agatha felt the change as the spell dropped but was so enraptured in wanton need, so completely blissed out, so focused on her new goal, so free from the control that she clung to so desperately, she didn’t make any move to flip them. Rio had taken command fully and seeing her like this, Agatha was all too happy to let her keep it.</p><p>Her hands moved to Rio’s hips, not to shove her away but to pull her closer.</p>

<p>
<span>Rio had ridden her face with a desperation that had left them both breathless and gasping. When she finally rolled off of Agatha she tumbled to the floor next to her, curling her body around Agatha’s protectively.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gently now, she turned Agatha’s face toward her. She kissed her lazily, smiling into it as she tasted herself on Agatha’s lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you feel better now about your command,</span>
<em>
<span> your majesty</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha teased, nipping at her lip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, reaching out tenderly towards her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” Agatha breathed, grabbing Rio’s hand from where she had reached to heal a mark at her neck. “Leave it, I like having your mark on me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed, pleased as she kissed the bruise but didn’t heal it further. She gazed adoringly at the woman next to her. Agatha was a mess, her hair wild, skin still flushed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hm. You’re my scar.” Rio said thoughtfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What does that mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It means, everyone can see that you’re mine,” Rio said, pressing her fingers possesively against Agatha’s hip. “But your marks are all over me too. You’ve carved your name into my heart. You’ve wrapped yourself around my mind. Just as surely as you’re mine. I’m yours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no hesitation in her voice, and she smiled adoringly before leaning forward and kissing her tenderly. “I love you, Agatha,” she said simply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the words wash over her, a warmth blooming in her chest that reached all the way to her fingertips. She took Rio’s hand, intertwining their fingers as she gazed into her eyes, a soft smile lighting up her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you too,” she whispered, her voice laced with certainty and affection. “You have me—all of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression softened, and momentarily, the two of them simply held each other’s gaze, the quiet understanding between them needing no further words. Agatha reached up to brush a stray strand of hair away from Rio’s face, her touch gentle, reverent, as if she were committing every line and curve of her to memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come to bed with me,” Agatha murmured, groaning slightly as she stood up from the floor. She took Rio’s hand in hers tugging her close as they settled into bed together. Rio wrapped her arms around her, pulling her into a protective embrace, and Agatha nestled into the warmth, feeling a deep contentment settle over her. She could feel Rio’s heartbeat steady beneath her hand, grounding her in the moment, in the feeling of being wholly together and at peace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they lay there, Agatha’s fingers traced gentle patterns along Rio’s arm, her voice soft as she spoke into the quiet. “No matter what happens, no matter what changes… I’ll always be yours.” She paused, pressing a kiss to Rio’s hand. “And nothing—not even the Underworld itself—will take that away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes, smiling softly as she held Agatha closer, allowing herself to believe, just for a moment, that the two of them could remain like this—unchanged by time, by duty, by the demands of a world that could be so dark. With Agatha in her arms, she felt a hope she had never dared to imagine, a love so powerful it had managed to change her very heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for tonight, that was enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the months that followed, Agatha and Rio grew inseparable, their love no longer confined to hushed confessions or stolen glances. They moved through the Underworld as if they had always belonged together, their bond a quiet but powerful presence that the realm itself seemed to respond to. Even when they had sex, even their most spirited sessions, held a new current of gentleness. They still fought with teeth, but the bite and sting of passion was always soothed after by a kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They said </span>
<em>
<span>“I love you”</span>
</em>
<span> often and freely, the words flowing as naturally as breath, unafraid and unguarded. Agatha’s laugh rang out in the once somber halls, and Rio’s answering smile softened the shadows that had so long defined her world. In the garden, once lifeless and overgrown with dark blooms, new life thrived under Agatha’s touch. Bright blossoms and fruit trees sprang forth, their colors vivid against the dark soil, as if responding to the warmth they had found in each other. </span>
</p><p>
<span>One day, as they wandered through the garden together, Rio took Agatha’s hand and lifted it to her lips, pressing a soft kiss to her knuckles. At that moment, delicate vines sprang to life, winding gently around Agatha’s finger in a graceful bloom, like a daisy-chain ring. Agatha’s eyes widened as she looked at the small, living token, her heart swelling with a joy so pure it left her breathless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They loved each other unhurriedly, savoring each touch, each look, as if time held no power over them. The knowledge of Agatha’s eventual return to the surface was a quiet undercurrent, no longer a cause for dread. Instead, it gave their moments a new depth, a reminder that their love would not fade with distance. They had found something unbreakable—a trust in the roots they’d laid together, and a confidence that wherever they went, they belonged to each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio would sometimes catch herself watching Agatha, her eyes lingering on the marks they’d left on each other’s hearts. “You’re mine,” she would murmur, her fingers tracing the curve of Agatha’s cheek, a fierce pride and love mingling in her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Always. And you’re mine,” Agatha would answer, her voice filled with certainty as she leaned in, letting their foreheads touch, a gesture as sacred as any vow. They had become each other’s home, and that certainty was enough to face whatever lay ahead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The last night came quietly, a gentle inevitability in the air that neither of them wanted to acknowledge, though it lingered in every shared glance and touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They moved through their evening together as if nothing had changed, the familiarity of their routines offering a kind of comfort. Agatha tended to the garden, her fingers brushing over the flowers she had coaxed into bloom, while Rio watched her from the shadows, a soft ache building in her chest. The thought of this space without Agatha’s laughter, without her warmth, made everything seem colder, and emptier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the evening wore on, they found themselves by the garden pool, the silvery waters casting faint reflections of lanterns of the underworld over their skin. Agatha dipped her fingers into the cool water, her expression thoughtful, and Rio felt a pang as she recognized the far-off look in her eyes. It was as if she were already halfway to the surface, her mind reaching for the world she would return to in just a few hours.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then Agatha turned, her gaze meeting Rio’s, and that distant look faded, replaced by something softer, more resolute. She crossed the distance between them, and without a word, she took Rio’s hand, her thumb tracing gentle circles along her knuckles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Here a soft, earthy scent lingered in the air, and the colors of the blossoms seemed almost luminescent in the dim light. Here, surrounded by the life they had nurtured together, Agatha turned to face Rio, her expression open and vulnerable. She didn’t need to say what was on her mind as her breath caught slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze softened, though a bittersweet smile played on her lips. “You’ll see it again,” she murmured, her fingers tightening around Agatha’s. “And I’ll be waiting, just as I always am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A silence settled between them, heavy and fragile, as if the moment might shatter with a single breath. Agatha reached up, brushing her fingers along Rio’s jaw, the touch featherlight but grounding, as if to reassure them both that they were still here, together, for now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha said softly, a quiet determination in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s chest tightened, and she pulled Agatha close, pressing her lips to her forehead in a gesture that was equal parts love and quiet desperation. She wanted to say something, to find the right words, but nothing seemed to capture the feeling of watching Agatha prepare to leave. So she held her, letting the silence speak for her, letting her heart pour into that embrace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They made their way to the bed they’d shared so many nights before, but this time, there was an urgency beneath their movements, as if they could imprint every touch, every whispered promise into memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gently moved her to her knees, Agatha’s face pressed into the pillow. They had played before with the toy that now hung low on Rio’s hips. But not like this. Agatha moaned deeply as she felt Rio press inside her. Gentle hands reached down, intertwining in hers, as Rio leaned over her, pressing a hundred tender kisses to her shoulders and back. With each slow and deep thrust of her hips, Rio whispered her adoration in a way that was indistinguishable from prayers of worship.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All night they made love to each other, lost in this space. Finding themselves again, as they always would be, enraptured in one another.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the dawn came, it crept in softly, spilling into the room like a reminder of all that was waiting beyond these walls. Agatha nestled into Rio’s arms, her head resting on her chest as they lay tangled together, breathing in sync. For a moment, they could almost forget that this would be their last night together—for now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers traced gentle patterns along Agatha’s back, her voice a murmur in the stillness. “Remember my love, you carry a part of me with you, wherever you go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand found Rio’s, intertwining their fingers as she looked up, a small, bittersweet smile on her face. “And I’ll return, carrying the part of myself I leave here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed like that, holding each other, grounding themselves in the knowledge that even as they parted, their love would remain tethering them here—a promise, a vow, deeply understood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Two souls, together, created something new.</span>

<p>
<span>Rio stepped onto the surface with the ease of slipping into an old habit, the chill of the evening air a stark contrast to the warmth she carried within her. Tonight, two souls awaited her collection. Two souls she assumed would be strangers, unremarkable travelers from one realm to the next. </span>
</p><p>
<span>What she hadn’t expected was to see Agatha waiting in the clearing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s pulse quickened, a rare break in her composed façade. She hadn’t seen Agatha since their final night together, and the sharp ache of missing her had settled into something she thought she’d learned to bear. But here she was, silhouetted against the faint moonlight, a small smirk playing at her lips, completely unsurprised to see her this early.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio said, her voice low and laced with surprise. She took in the scene, noting the two bodies on the ground nearby. Her gaze flicked to Agatha’s face, searching for answers. “I assume these were your doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, a flicker of regret in her eyes but no hesitation. “I needed to see you,” she said, her voice steady. “And I couldn’t wait any longer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help the faint grin that tugged at her lips, an old instinct to mask the rush of emotions bubbling beneath her calm exterior. Ever the charmer, she reached out and willed a small flower into her hand, a sprig of nightshade with deep purple petals that seemed to shimmer in the moonlight. She extended it to Agatha, her voice a low murmur. “For you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression softened as she took the flower, a touch of warmth flickering in her eyes as she tucked it behind her ear. The gesture felt so natural, so perfectly them, and yet there was a weight between them, a sense that something unspoken hovered just beneath the surface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I needed to tell you something important,” Agatha said softly, breaking the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a slow step closer, her gaze never leaving Agatha’s face, taking in every familiar detail, savoring the ache that twisted in her chest. She could feel the shift in the air between them, the quiet intensity in Agatha’s gaze, and something told her that whatever Agatha was about to say would change everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then tell me,” Rio replied, her voice a murmur, the words carrying a mix of anticipation and a rare vulnerability she allowed herself only in moments like these. “I can’t stay long…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught as Agatha took her hand, guiding it to rest against her abdomen. The gentle swell beneath her fingers was subtle but unmistakable, and a pulse of warmth seemed to radiate from Agatha’s skin, filling Rio’s hand with something that felt profoundly alive. She froze, her mind reeling, unable to process the impossible truth before her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could always feel the pulse of Agatha’s soul, her life, her heartbeat a steady thrum. Here now she realized, she felt another energy with them. Small, but growing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha…” Rio’s voice faltered, disbelief clouding her usually steady tone. “There’s no way. This—this isn’t possible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha was smiling, her eyes shining with a happiness Rio had never seen so openly on her face. “It is,” she whispered, her hand covering Rio’s, anchoring it there as if that could somehow make it real. “I’ve known for about a month.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart pounded, the certainty of her world shaken. The Underworld—her domain, her power—it took life, it didn’t create it. This defied every law she understood, every rule that had governed her existence since she’d first donned her crown. How could </span>
<em>
<span>she</span>
</em>
<span>, of all beings, bring life into the world?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did this…?” she began, her voice wavering, the questions crowding her mind chaotic and unanswered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression softened as she squeezed Rio’s hand, her gaze unwavering. “How it usually happens,” she said simply, her voice filled with quiet wonder. “Love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to speak, but the words tangled in her throat. Love. Agatha made it sound so easy, so natural. Yet this was anything but—this was miraculous and terrifying and entirely uncharted territory for someone like her. Her mind spun, a storm of questions she couldn’t voice tightening her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s joy was palpable, her whole being radiant with it, but Rio felt a dark twinge of fear gnawing at her own heart. What would this mean—for her, for Agatha, for the delicate balance of life and death she was sworn to uphold? A tiny, vulnerable part of her wanted to lean into Agatha’s happiness, to let that brightness banish the uncertainty swirling inside her. But her guarded instincts held her back, as sharp and instinctual as a blade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha seemed to sense Rio’s hesitation, her expression softening, her hand resting gently against Rio’s cheek. “I know it’s… a lot,” she murmured, her voice gentle, coaxing. “But I thought when I found out—I thought maybe it was fate. Something that could belong to both of us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio met her gaze, her heart torn between that same glimmer of hope and the weight of her own fears. She managed a small, almost hesitant smile, but her mind continued to whirl with the impossible implications. This had never been part of her world’s design—yet here they stood, bound by a love that had defied every law she knew.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My realm,” she spoke hesitantly, caught between her fear and pride, “it’s no place for a child.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed thoughtfully. “Our </span>
<em>
<span>home</span>
</em>
<span> is, my love. We grew a garden together. We created this child. We can build our home.” She leaned forward and kissed Rio gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught as she looked at Agatha, so beautiful, glowing in the moonlight. </span>
<em>
<span>A child. </span>
</em>
<span>She thought with wonder. She had no idea how it would work. But she knew that she would give her love anything in her power to do so. She would try.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s vision blurred as a surge of emotions rose up, fierce and unrestrained, her tears spilling before she could stop them. She cupped Agatha’s face, her trembling hands brushing away the strands of hair framing her cheeks. The impossibility of it all—their love, this child, this life growing within her beloved—it broke past every wall she had remaining within her. Already marked by this woman, Rio felt her heart fully open, raw, and vulnerable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unable to find the right words, she closed the distance between them, pressing her lips to Agatha’s in a tender, lingering kiss. Every unspoken emotion poured into that embrace: her fear, her astonishment, and, woven through it all, the overwhelming love that had changed everything. She pulled back slowly, eyes tracing every line of Agatha’s face as if she needed to memorize it anew.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But as the moments passed, reality crept in, tugging at the edges of her heart. She had been summoned to the surface for a reason, and her duties were waiting, demanding attention. She swallowed, steadying herself, forcing her voice into something resembling composure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have to go,” she murmured, her tone soft yet reluctant. She forced a smile, caressing Agatha’s cheek one last time. “But I’ll see you soon. I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha caught her hand, holding it close, and Rio could see the sparkle in her eyes, filled with a quiet certainty and warmth. “You’ll see </span>
<em>
<span>us</span>
</em>
<span> soon,” Agatha replied, her voice a gentle affirmation, her hand drifting down to her stomach as she smiled, the soft glow of love radiating from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her heart twist, a strange mix of joy and sorrow tightening her chest. She nodded, barely able to find her voice. With one last look, she slipped away, her figure blending into the shadows as she left Agatha and the miracle they shared. As she departed, she felt the weight of her role settle back onto her shoulders, but the warmth of Agatha’s touch lingered, a promise of something new and unbreakable that would follow her wherever she went.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Rio sat alone in her chamber, a heaviness pressing down on her that no shadow in the underworld could match. Her thoughts were tangled in the unyielding logic of life and death, her existence built on rules that had never bent, not until now. She, the queen of death, had created life. It defied everything she knew of herself, her purpose. The impossible had happened, yet here it was—a small heartbeat that would grow, a child born from love.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But a new ache stirred within her, darker than her worst fears. Agatha would have to return here before long, bound by their contract. And what would that mean for their child, for a baby born of Death? For a child to be born in this place, away from all things living. Rio pressed her hands together, feeling a chill at the thought of the underworld’s grasp on such a fragile, new life. She couldn’t allow it; she wouldn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And so, the grim solution began to settle in her mind, inevitable and merciless: she would have to find a way to bend their contract. She would need to find a way to make Agatha stay on the surface, away from her, so that she could protect the life they’d created. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart twisted as she imagined the cost. Keeping Agatha at a distance—keeping her away from the underworld and away from her, away from the love they’d nurtured so carefully. It was a pain that rooted deep in her bones, but it was the only way to safeguard their child. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifted her gaze to the dark stone ceiling, feeling the tears prick at her eyes, but she forced them back. She would need to be stronger than ever, not for herself, but for Agatha, and for the life she never thought possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ran a hand over her face, staring into the dim light cast across the stone floor, trying to steady the storm inside her. How would she even begin to explain this to Agatha? The thought of seeing her face fall, of that brilliant hope dimming in her eyes—it was too much to bear. How could she tell her that their love, which had defied all boundaries, now demanded this cruel separation?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She thought of Agatha’s joy, the way she’d placed Rio’s hand on her stomach with that radiant smile, so full of promise. Agatha was already seeing the future with hope, already dreaming of a life for the three of them. And Rio? She felt as if she were being asked to tear that future apart, piece by piece.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How could she make Agatha understand? She could imagine Agatha’s insistence, the way she’d fight this, try to reason with her, try to remind her that love had brought them this far. But Rio knew what the underworld was. She had lived and ruled it long enough to know that it would not be kind to a newborn—especially one born from the impossible, from her own essence. If she couldn’t protect this child from its darkness, she would have to protect it by distance. And that distance would break her. But better her than </span>
<em>
<span>them</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clenched her fists, searching for the words she would have to use, imagining the way Agatha might listen, hurt and defiant. Agatha would never accept this plan willingly, not without Rio tearing down every dream she’d allowed herself to imagine. She would see it as cruel. It </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> cruel. And how could Rio do that to her, to the woman who had trusted her, who had finally given her heart so completely? How could she possibly ask Agatha to stay away, to keep their child safe on the surface—a request that would likely feel like a rejection, like Rio denying the life they had built together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed her eyes, feeling the weight of her own grim decision solidify, and with it, the searing reality of what came next. She’d have to tell Agatha that their child’s only hope was a life away from here, away from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pain twisted deeper, making her wonder if she’d have the strength to carry out her own words. She didn’t see another choice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed her hands against her temples, feeling the weight of her own helplessness pressing down on her like an unyielding stone. She couldn’t let herself believe that breaking Agatha’s heart was their only option—not yet. There had to be something else, some old magic buried deep within the underworld's ancient lore, some lost spell that might make it possible for their child to survive here. For both of them to stay together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind drifted back to fragments of ancient texts, whispers of powers that few had dared to wield. The legends spoke of bindings and protections, of magic that even she, as the queen of the underworld, had never attempted. It was magic meant to be forgotten, buried in the underworld’s depths as tightly as the dead it harbored. But maybe… just maybe, if she searched deep enough, if she could find even a sliver of something that could offer protection, she could avoid this fate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a deep breath, her resolve hardening. She would begin the search immediately. She would pour over every ancient tome in her library, probe every corner of her kingdom for remnants of forgotten spells. If there was even the slightest chance she could alter the contract, and allow Agatha and their child to stay here </span>
<em>
<span>together</span>
</em>
<span> safely, she would not rest until she had found it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, doubt clawed at her. Old magic was often too dangerous, and no ritual of this depth had been attempted in an eternity. Fundamentally, the underworld wasn’t meant to nurture life. She, herself, was bound by its laws, and what she was seeking would challenge the very essence of her realm. Even if she found the spell or ritual she needed, it might not work—or worse, it might ask something of her that would endanger everything she and Agatha had fought for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, the risk was worth it. She could not bear the thought of losing Agatha, of separating her from their child. She had time, she reminded herself, a precious few months before Agatha’s return. A few after that before the child,</span>
<em>
<span> their child</span>
</em>
<span>, would take its first breath. And during that time, she would do everything in her power to find a way to keep them both safe here, within the only home she had ever known.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers flexed, her heart brimming with fierce determination. She would leave no stone unturned, no spell untested. She owed that to Agatha, to the love that had defied all odds, and to the child she had never dreamed could exist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She allowed herself a small, glimmering hope—maybe, just maybe, she would find a way to make this work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sank into her throne, letting herself imagine the life growing inside Agatha—</span>
<em>
<span>their</span>
</em>
<span> child, a soul born of two worlds, with one foot in light and the other in darkness. She tried to picture the face of this impossible miracle, her mind flitting over features she might recognize as her own or as Agatha’s, softened or sharpened in ways she couldn’t yet see.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Would their child carry Agatha’s bright blue eyes, with that fierce spark of curiosity that had always unnerved Rio? Or perhaps they’d have her own, darker gaze, tempered by the weight of ancient knowledge and a sense of stillness that only the underworld could bestow. She imagined a blend of their features: soft, smiling lips like Agatha’s, but framed by a serious expression that mirrored her own. A wild mess of hair, perhaps, something that would remind her of both Agatha’s resilience and her own stubborn nature.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And their temperament—would they take after Agatha, with her boundless compassion, that endless urge to nurture and heal? Or would their child inherit Rio’s guardedness, her silent strength, her need to protect those she loved even at her own expense? She wondered if their child might grow into a ruler like her, but with a softer hand, a gentler touch that Rio herself had never quite mastered. Or perhaps they would wield a fiery, rebellious spirit like Agatha’s, tempered with the wisdom and restraint that came from carrying death in their veins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A smile, faint and unbidden, tugged at Rio’s lips as she imagined a laugh that would sound like both of theirs woven together—a unique echo of their love. She thought of small hands reaching for hers, of a voice calling her to her as its mother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As these visions took hold, a wave of tenderness flooded through her. She could see Agatha’s influence, their love, their life together, woven into this child who might one day challenge both of them, who would come to know both the land of the living and the underworld as their birthrights. This child, she realized, could grow to be the best of both worlds—both theirs, but wholly themselves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought was terrifying and beautiful, and it anchored her resolve to find a way to keep Agatha and their child safe, no matter the cost. For the first time, Rio allowed herself to hope that, somehow, this impossible dream could be more than fleeting. It could be a future—a future with Agatha, with their child, and with a love that defied even death’s own limits.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She would make it so. She <em>had</em> to. For all of their sakes.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha sat on the porch of the cabin, gazing over the small clearing. It was isolated, surrounded by thick trees and dense fog that only seemed to clear around midday. Her hands rested on her stomach, almost protectively, as she took in the silence around her. It was hers now. She’d been decisive—ruthless, even—but she couldn’t bring herself to regret it. This cabin, nestled in the woods and smelling faintly of pine and smoke, could be the closest thing to a home she’d have for the coming months.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t shake the anticipation that filled her as she thought of Rio joining her here. She’d be here soon. The previous owner, a hunter, lay just outside the threshold. Agatha hadn’t liked the way he’d leered at her anyway. The way his warning about how “a woman with child shouldn’t be in these dangerous woods,” had sounded like a threat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the familiar brush of cold air, she turned to see Rio appear just beyond the treeline. Agatha’s heart skipped as Rio’s gaze swept over her, then the cabin, taking in the surroundings with an expression of barely concealed curiosity. Agatha gave her a small, playful smile, trying to lighten the sudden weight in the air between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth quirked into a smirk as she stepped forward. “So,” she said, her voice rich with amusement, “you killed someone else just to see me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, though her lips curved in response. “Do you think I just kill someone every time I miss you?” She raised an eyebrow, a playful gleam in her eye. “I’d have a very long list by now, wouldn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk softened, a warmth flickering in her expression. She stepped closer, tracing her fingers over the cabin’s doorframe. As she traced the entryway, a wreath bloomed to hang just over the door. Woven branches of cedar for protection, and little bundles of lavender, rosemary, and mugwort to strengthen the effect. “It’s… more than I expected,” she admitted, glancing around, as if surprised Agatha had made this effort. “Though I truly didn’t expect to see you yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let her eyes roam over Agatha’s body, settling on the swell of her stomach. A few months had passed and it was obvious how her lover’s body was changing as their child grew. Rio had always been hopelessly attracted to her, but now every protective instinct she carried was heightened. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, come now, Rio,” Agatha teased, her tone light but her eyes serious. “You get so few glimpses of this life we’re creating. And I… I want you here. I don’t want you to miss anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At her words, Rio’s gaze softened, and she reached out, cupping Agatha’s cheek in her cool hand. “You did all this because you wanted me to see… what exactly?” she asked, voice low, a tenderness creeping in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took Rio’s hand and placed it gently over her stomach. She saw the quick flicker of wonder in Rio’s eyes, and it sent a warmth flooding through her. “This,” she murmured, her voice steady despite the vulnerability that gripped her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt the unmistakable kick beneath her palm, and her breath caught, the sensation incredibly surreal. Her gaze stayed fixed on Agatha’s stomach, an awe spreading over her face that she couldn’t hide. She had expected to feel a stirring—some flicker of awareness—but this? This was life, tangible and undeniable, pushing back against her touch with a strength that left her stunned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hand remained on Agatha’s stomach, fingers splayed as though to anchor her to this impossible reality. “They’re strong,” she murmured, her voice thick with reverence. “Our child… They’re already strong.” She knelt in front of Agatha and pressed a gentle kiss to her stomach. “Aren’t you little one?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her, an almost shy smile tugging at her lips. “They take after you, I think,” she replied, her voice soft.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, her gaze still glued to the place where her child had kicked. “You,” she said, an uncharacteristic, quiet certainty in her tone. “That spirit—that resilience—no one could mistake that for anyone but you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, a gentle sound filled with warmth. “I think they’re a little of both of us, don’t you?” She reached down, brushing her fingers along Rio’s jaw, grounding her in the moment. “A life that could only be created because we found each other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s chin lifted, her gaze meeting Agatha’s. She hadn’t imagined, not even in her wildest dreams, that she could be a part of something so… alive. She, who had always been the bringer of endings, was here, holding the beginning of something precious and entirely hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha…” She paused, unable to find words grand enough to capture the wonder she felt, the fierce protectiveness that flared up inside her. It was a feeling so intense it threatened to overwhelm her, and yet, all she could do was whisper, “I… I will keep you both safe. No matter what it takes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand reached down and pulled her to her feet, her fingers threading through Rio’s own. “I know,” she said simply, the unwavering faith in her voice grounding Rio even more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed like that for a long moment, the quiet punctuated only by their shared breaths, a peace settling between them that seemed to pull the whole world into focus. Rio’s hand lingered over the life they’d created together, marveling at the impossible future unfolding before her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha led her into the little cabin. “I thought… it’d make a nice cottage for a little while, somewhere we could… be together.” She smiled, a bit sheepishly. “Think of it as a tiny piece of the mortal world, where we can pretend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let her hand linger over Agatha’s stomach, her fingers splaying with reverence. A strange mix of emotions crossed her face, as if she were seeing something precious and forbidden all at once. Her gaze turned almost teasing again, though her voice was laced with affection. “You’re lucky I’m rather fond of you, or I’d have to scold you and remind you not to kill anyone for me. Not every time, at least. You’re setting a bad example for the kid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled softly, her free hand trailing up Rio’s arm. “I’ll try to restrain myself in the future.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A quiet filled the space between them, charged yet tender. Rio’s gaze drifted down, lingering where her hand rested on Agatha’s stomach. Her face grew contemplative.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice dropped to a near whisper. “You want me to stay here… so I can see them grow,” she murmured, the words almost lost in the air between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her eyes bright. “Yes. I want you to be here… to be part of this. Whatever happens, Rio, this—” She placed her hand over Rio’s, pressing it gently against her. “This belongs to us. You’re part of this just as much as I am. And no one else, no person, no fate, nothing will stand in the way of that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face softened, her expression unreadable as she studied Agatha’s face. “You’re… relentless,” she murmured, a faint, almost affectionate accusation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You love it,” Agatha countered, her voice warm, with that mischievous gleam that Rio could never resist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth lifted at one corner, and she drew Agatha close, pressing a kiss to her forehead, lingering a little longer than usual. “Maybe I do,” she admitted, her voice barely a breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stood together in the silence of the cabin, the world around them hushed, as if the woods themselves respected the intimacy of the moment. And for now, at least, there was nothing but them—an unspoken promise hanging between them in that tiny, hidden cabin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you stay?” Agatha’s question was soft, hopeful, her eyes searching Rio’s with a quiet longing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I… have work,” Rio replied, her voice regretful, though her hand still lingered, reluctant to let go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Soon, then,” Agatha said, a gentle smile in her eyes as she squeezed Rio’s hand. “Just don’t take too long.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio returned the squeeze, a rare softness in her own gaze. “I’ll come as soon as I can.” She leaned forward, pressing a lingering kiss to Agatha’s lips, then drew back slowly, her gaze flicking to Agatha’s stomach one last time. “I’ll see you </span>
<em>
<span>both</span>
</em>
<span> soon,” she murmured, a quiet promise lingering in the air between them. Then, with a final kiss, she stepped back, her presence fading into the cool night air, leaving Agatha alone with the heartbeat of their shared dream nestled beneath her own.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>For a few precious months that summer, it was as if a great and subtle grace had swept over the world. The wars that had raged across continents seemed to slow, like tides drawn back to rest. Armies found themselves halting, the battles that had felt inevitable slipping out of focus, their edges blunted as treaties took hold where none should have. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In places around the world, doctors and healers witnessed small wonders—patients who had been all but gone took unexpected, almost magical turns toward life. Plagued lungs strengthened, fevers broke, and doctors shook their heads, chalking it up to mysteries of medicine or blessings from above. But behind these recoveries was Rio, quietly holding back her hand from souls she might once have claimed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And as she spent more time with Agatha, each recovery, each life saved felt like another step into a fragile and vibrant world she was still learning to understand. The weight of her usual duties became more distant, softened by Agatha's touch, by the feeling of their child growing day by day. When she looked into Agatha’s eyes or felt the soft pulse of their child’s heartbeat beneath her fingers, she felt her unyielding commitment shift, softened by something unthinkable—a willingness to let things be, to allow for joy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She still had to frequently return to the underworld, she couldn’t allow the souls to grow restless and idle. There was also the business of what she would do when Agatha was due to return there. But when she was in the sun, sharing that sacred little home with her, she put those things out of her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The world flourished with an almost tangible warmth, a soft but miraculous pulse of hope woven through even the simplest lives. Stories trickled through villages and towns of children who should not have woken up but had, of frail elders who somehow made it through the night hanging on just a little bit longer. These tales of unlikely recoveries filled people with joy and a quiet awe, as if, for a brief moment, they’d been allowed a glimpse of a life lighter than before. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And for Rio, this peace felt like a stolen gift—a way to indulge in what she'd believed was impossible: a chance to share time, love, and life with Agatha and their unborn child. She knew, of course, that she could not stay away forever. Every person only had so much time. But for now, each of those reclaimed lives, those miraculous recoveries, seemed a fair trade for one more precious day together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the beginning of the end of summer cast its golden light over the cabin, Agatha shifted in her chair, trying to find a comfortable position. She was visibly uncomfortable, her hand resting on her lower back as she leaned forward, a weary sigh escaping her lips. Her once-swift movements had slowed, and even simple tasks left her breathless. The baby seemed to grow heavier by the day, pressing against her bones and pulling at her muscles in a way that was both miraculous and exhausting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio noticed the strain in Agatha’s face the moment she walked in, and without a word, she slipped off her cloak and came to her side. She held a freshly-picked bundle of lavender and chamomile in her hands, the small flowers carefully arranged with a few sprays of delicate, tiny daisies in between.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lavender to ease your rest, chamomile to soften your worries, and daisies,” Rio said with a quiet smile, “for the innocence of new life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned into her touch, smiling despite her discomfort. “You’re too good to me,” she murmured, her voice filled with a weary warmth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knelt down beside her, reaching for Agatha’s hand and pressing a soft kiss to her knuckles. “Good has nothing to do with it. I just… I want to see you relaxed. As much as you can be,” she added, her thumb brushing along Agatha’s knuckles with a tenderness that was somehow both gentle and fierce.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile softened as she looked down at Rio, a tenderness filling her gaze. “I know,” she whispered, squeezing Rio’s hand. “And I’m grateful. I really am. But…” She hesitated, her words weighed down by a heaviness she’d tried to ignore. “It’s hard, Rio. Carrying them alone, even with you coming here as often as you can. It’s—” She broke off, her eyes tearing slightly. “It’s… a lot. And some days, I feel like I can barely make it through.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words tumbled out before she could stop them, and she lowered her gaze, feeling almost guilty for admitting her weariness. She wanted so much to be strong, to show Rio how much she could handle. But as the days had stretched into months, her strength had started to wane under the quiet but constant toll of carrying their child.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face softened, and she brought her hand up to cup Agatha’s cheek, brushing her thumb gently along her jawline. “I wish I could be here every moment,” she said, a note of regret slipping into her voice. “If I could, I’d stay by your side and make sure you didn’t have to lift a single finger. I’d carry the weight with you if I could.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes brightened, though a glint of tears shimmered there as she leaned into Rio’s touch. “I know you would,” she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. “And knowing that helps. It really does. But some days… I just wish you could be here more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked away briefly, her expression taut with frustration. She had bent so many rules, stretched the boundaries of her duties just to spend these moments with Agatha, but it was never enough. Not for either of them. Every time she left, she felt as though she was abandoning her, leaving her to bear the burden alone. And yet, each time she returned, Agatha was still there, waiting with open arms, as if every stolen moment was enough to sustain her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t deal in half measures. Yet here she was caught between love and obligation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Reaching for Agatha’s other hand, Rio met her gaze, determination in her eyes. “For as long as I can be here, I’ll do everything I can to make it easier. And when I’m not…” She faltered, feeling the weight of her own helplessness. “When I’m not, just remember that I’m with you in every way I can be, even if you can’t see me. I’ll make sure these woods protect you. I’ll keep you safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a small nod, her lips curving into a tired but grateful smile. “Thank you,” she murmured, her hand reaching up to gently brush a stray lock of hair from Rio’s forehead. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression softened, and she gave Agatha’s hand a reassuring squeeze. “You’re stronger than you know,” she whispered, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “But I’ll be here as much as I can to remind you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed that way for a moment, each taking comfort in the quiet presence of the other. Finally, Rio shifted, a glimmer of playfulness returning to her eyes. She moved her hand down to Agatha’s belly, her fingers brushing lightly over the swell, as if trying to connect with the tiny life growing inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, little one,” she murmured, leaning closer, her voice low and playful. “Listen up. Your mother is the strongest person I know, and you’d better be nice to her, or you’ll be dealing with me. Stop doing acrobatics in there, you keep punching her bladder.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a soft laugh, her fingers lacing through Rio’s hair as she watched her with an affectionate smile. “You’re going to scare them before they even have a chance to misbehave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at the corners of her mouth. “Oh, I </span>
<em>
<span>fully</span>
</em>
<span> intend to. This child of ours will need a healthy respect for the rules. Otherwise, I’m afraid they’ll take after you a little too well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, the sound rich and full despite her fatigue. “Is that right? And who’s the one always bending the rules to be here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio feigned innocence, lifting her gaze to meet Agatha’s. “That’s called dedication,” she replied with a grin, “a trait I hope they inherit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, shaking her head as she continued to smile. “Dedication, sure. And I suppose they’ll get my knack for rule-breaking along with your sense of duty. That’s a dangerous combination.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression softened, her hand moving gently over Agatha’s belly as if she were imagining the future she barely dared to hope for. “Maybe so,” she said, her voice quiet but filled with warmth. “There are worse things.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you stay awhile?” Agatha asked, hating how small her voice sounded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure dear, I’ll just call for world peace for a little longer. No big deal,” Rio teased. She stood and leaned down to kiss Agatha. “I can stay a little longer. What do you need from me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right now I need to lay down,” Agatha said tiredly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded and led her to the bed tucked in the corner of the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up at Rio, her expression softening, a hint of something unspoken glimmering in her eyes. She hesitated, then gave a small, almost shy smile. “I miss you, you know,” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. “Not just you being here… but your touch. All of that feels so distant sometimes.” She paused, biting her lip. “It’s like there’s a part of me that’s constantly waiting, missing you, even when you’re right here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze softened as she reached out, tucking a loose strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear. “I know,” she replied quietly, her thumb brushing gently over Agatha’s cheek. Her mind drifted, unbidden, to memories of their more intimate moments—the quiet laughter they shared in the dark, the way Agatha’s fingers traced patterns along her, the warmth and closeness that wrapped around them like a shield from the world. She felt her heart quicken at the thought, longing settling in her chest like a weight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips curved in a gentle smile, as if she, too, were lost in the memory. “I think about it sometimes,” she admitted, a faint blush coloring her cheeks. “I know I’m not exactly graceful right now, but… well…” Her voice trailed off, and she looked up at Rio, a soft glimmer of mischief in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, the sound low and warm. “I think graceful is highly overrated,” she replied with a grin, her fingers tracing small, comforting circles over Agatha’s hand. “But perhaps,” she added, her voice softening as her gaze drifted to Agatha’s shoulders, tense from carrying the weight of the baby, “a massage might do for now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes lit up, and she nodded with eager enthusiasm. “Yes, please. That sounds… wonderful.” She leaned back, trying to find a comfortable position as Rio gently guided her to sit at the edge of the bed, reaching for a small bottle of lavender-scented oil she’d brought a few visits ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio began to work her fingers gently into Agatha’s shoulders, her touch firm but careful, kneading away the tension that had settled there. Agatha let out a sigh, her eyes fluttering closed as she sank into the sensation, her body relaxing under Rio’s skilled hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have no idea how much I’ve needed this,” Agatha murmured, her voice a contented hum as Rio’s hands moved down her back, easing each knot with practiced care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled softly. “I think I have a pretty good idea,” she replied, her voice filled with warmth. “You’ve been carrying a lot—literally and otherwise. I’d be a poor partner if I didn’t make sure you were taken care of.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, her eyes still closed as she leaned into Rio’s touch, letting herself be cared for in a way that she often struggled to allow. “You always know just what I need,” she whispered, feeling a wave of gratitude wash over her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands moved down her back, tracing over each curve with a reverence that spoke of her love, her fingers working away every bit of tension they found. For a moment, the world outside their cabin felt far away, as if it were just the two of them, caught in this quiet, tender moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the massage continued, Agatha felt her worries slip away, her heart filled with a deep, steady peace she rarely allowed herself to feel. She reached out, squeezing Rio’s hand as she whispered, “Thank you… for being here. For everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned down, pressing a soft kiss to Agatha’s shoulder. “Always,” she murmured, letting her lips linger there as if to seal her promise. “For as long as you need me. C’mere, let me get your legs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifted her legs onto her lap and began to massage her feet, her touch firm but soothing. Agatha closed her eyes, a small sigh of relief escaping her as Rio worked her thumbs in slow circles along her arches.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, I love your hands,” Agatha moaned, leaning back her head in pleasure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, even though the sound had been caused by this innocent gesture, she couldn’t help how she responded to the familiar sight. She thought back to the other times she had drawn that moan from Agatha. In a different place she would’ve placed hungry kisses to her neck. But she wouldn’t bother Agatha with that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve been carrying them for months,” Rio murmured as she moved to Agatha’s calves, her fingers working out the tension there. “The least I can do is make it a little easier on you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, sinking back into the pillows as Rio’s hands worked their way up to her knees, easing each knot and ache. She let out a contented hum as Rio’s hands moved higher, to her thighs, and finally to her lower back, where she pressed her palms gently but with a steady pressure that sent waves of relief through Agatha’s body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know you don’t have to take care of me every minute. I know what you’re giving up each time you come here,” Agatha protested lightly, though her words lacked any real conviction. Her voice softened as Rio’s hands worked their magic along her spine. “But… I’m not complaining.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Rio replied, her voice a low murmur against Agatha’s hair. “I won’t hear any complaints tonight.” She brushed a loose strand of hair from Agatha’s face, tucking it behind her ear as she leaned down to press a kiss to her forehead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio finally settled beside her, Agatha reached for her hand, lacing their fingers together. “Tell me what else you brought,” she whispered, glancing at the small collection of blooms Rio had gathered for her over the past few weeks. Flowers of every color were scattered along the windowsill, filling the room with a faint, sweet perfume.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a deep breath, her gaze softening as she looked over the flowers. “Those,” she said, pointing to a cluster of sunflowers, “are for loyalty and adoration. And the asters,” she continued, indicating a delicate purple bloom, “are for patience. Like the patience you’ve shown me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile deepened, her fingers squeezing Rio’s. “You know I’m not known for my patience,” she teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned down, brushing her lips softly against Agatha’s. “I know you,” she whispered, “and I adore you.” She settled beside her, their hands still entwined. After a moment, her lips quirked in a playful smile, and she leaned down, her voice dropping to a low murmur as she addressed their child directly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” she said, her voice warm with a gentle, teasing authority, “your mother is incredibly strong. And incredibly brave. And I love her so much. You’ve got no idea how good you’ve got it, getting to be with her all the time. She’s the best of this world. So if you’re listening in there, little one, you’d better make things easy on her, understand?” She rubbed gentle circles over Agatha’s belly, her fingers light, as if coaxing an agreement from the unborn listener. “It’s both of our jobs to keep her happy. So no slacking, junior.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a soft laugh, glancing at Rio with amusement dancing in her eyes. “Did you just give our child a pep talk?” she asked, brushing her hand over Rio’s where it rested against her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin widened, and she shrugged, not breaking eye contact with Agatha’s belly. “I don’t see why not,” she replied with a smirk. “Someone has to get them in line before they get here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed again, a light and joyful sound, and the baby responded with a tiny, distinct kick under Rio’s hand. Rio’s eyes widened, her smile transforming into something softer, filled with awe. She stilled, her thumb tracing the spot where she’d felt the movement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand drifted to rest over Rio’s, a gentle smile on her lips. She tilted her head thoughtfully, amusement lighting her eyes as she considered the baby nestled between them. “You know, I’m trying to picture what kind of mothers we’ll be,” she said, casting a sidelong glance at Rio. “But all I can see is you being the one who spoils them rotten.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, her brows lifting in mock offense. “Me? Spoiling them?” She leaned back, crossing her arms with an exaggerated pout. “Excuse me, but I think we both know who the soft one in this relationship really is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, really?” Agatha shot back, arching an eyebrow. “I seem to remember you bringing me flowers </span>
<em>
<span>every single time</span>
</em>
<span> you come back to the cabin. And don’t think I haven’t noticed how you get all teary every time you feel the baby kick. That’s not exactly the behavior of someone who’s going to be strict.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed, though she couldn’t hide the small, embarrassed smile tugging at her lips. “Alright, fine. I might have a soft spot, but that doesn’t mean I’ll be the one giving in every time they want something ridiculous. That’ll be you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me?” Agatha laughed, shaking her head as she settled back against the pillows. “Please, you’re the one who’s already talking to them in soft, endearing tones. I’m pretty sure you’ll melt the first time they give you those big, pleading eyes. You can’t even refuse that dog of yours anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, trailing her hand gently over Agatha, lost in thought. “Maybe… but if they start picking up bad habits, we’ll know who to blame.” She gave Agatha a pointed look, her eyes twinkling with mischief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh?” Agatha replied, her tone just as teasing. “What bad habits are you so worried about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips curved into a smirk as she leaned forward, resting her forehead against Agatha’s. “Well, for starters, that sharp tongue of yours,” she murmured, tapping her fingers playfully against Agatha’s side. “Or your tendency to act first and think later. Imagine a tiny little troublemaker, running around, charming everyone into their schemes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but couldn’t keep the grin from her face. “And I suppose they’ll get their brooding and self-righteous streak from you, then? They’ll probably be a master of sarcasm before they can even walk.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted. “Oh, absolutely. They’ll have to be, with you around,” she teased, her eyes softening as she gazed at Agatha. “But they’ll be brave, too. And stubborn as anything. I wonder if we’re ready for that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile softened, and she reached to brush her fingers along Rio’s cheek. “I think… they’ll have all the best parts of us. They’ll be strong and clever, and, if we’re lucky, maybe just a little bit rebellious.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, leaning in to press a kiss to Agatha’s forehead. “Then we’re going to have our hands full,” she said, feigning exasperation, though the pride in her voice was unmistakable. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned into her, wrapping an arm around her neck and letting her fingers trail through Rio’s hair. “I suppose we’re in for a lifetime of spoiling, discipline, and a little chaos in between.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sweetheart, we were already on track for that.” Agatha laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, now there’s going to be a little monster running around too. I’m going to have to keep my eyes on </span>
<em>
<span>two</span>
</em>
<span> of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slapped her shoulder in mock horror, “You did </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> just call our baby a little monster,” she said with an exasperated smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a chuckle, feigning innocence as she arched a brow. "What? I’m just being realistic." She placed a hand on Agatha’s belly again, rubbing gentle circles over it. "I mean, they’ll have your stubborn streak. That alone qualifies them as a handful."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, though her eyes sparkled with amusement. "Right, you wouldn’t know </span>
<em>
<span>anything</span>
</em>
<span> about being stubborn, my love,” she drawled sarcastically. “Between the two of us, this child’s bound to be… let’s say </span>
<em>
<span>spirited.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, clearly enjoying herself. “Spirited. Now there’s a polite way to put it.” She leaned down and spoke softly, directly to the bump. “Hey, little one, you don’t need to be too spirited, alright? Your mother here might not admit it, but she can only handle so much chaos in her life. And I don’t like to be upstaged.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, rolling her eyes. “Says the one who literally rules the Underworld. Between that and this kid I think you’re going to be the one needing a nap.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll find a way to manage.” Rio’s voice was soft, her fingers tracing gentle patterns across Agatha’s stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha relaxed into her touch, letting herself picture it—the three of them, sharing this quiet life. Her voice turned wistful. “Do you think they’ll have your dark hair?” She paused, a hint of shyness creeping in. “I think they’d look beautiful with it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression softened, a trace of wonder in her eyes. “Maybe,” she murmured, her hand shifting to gently squeeze Agatha’s. “And your eyes. I’d like that.” She hesitated, a tender vulnerability slipping through her usual confidence. “Do you think… do you think they’ll be happy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’ll be cherished. Of course, they will be.” Agatha said softly, brushing a thumb over Rio’s cheek. “They’ll have a garden to grow up in, a river to play by… mothers who loves them more fiercely than anything else in this world.” She leaned forward, kissing Rio gently, pouring all her affection into the touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled her close, lingering in the kiss as her heart swelled with the magnitude of what they were creating. “I guess I’m going to have to break it to Cerberus that he’s going to be a big brother,” she said. She didn’t let Agatha see it, but internally she recoiled as her thoughtless words reminded her that she still hadn’t fully considered what this child’s place would be in the underworld.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression softened, and she tilted her head thoughtfully. “Do you think they’ll be a boy or a girl?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat back for a moment, considering the question, her gaze distant as she looked at Agatha. “You know, I haven’t given it much thought,” she admitted, brushing her thumb absentmindedly over Agatha’s hand. “I only know…” She paused, her eyes turning bright with a quiet, protective fierceness as she looked back at Agatha. “I only know that they’ll be loved. And they’ll know who you are, Agatha. They’ll know the strength and kindness they came from. They’ll know how powerful the woman they came from is. The magic that brought them here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face softened, and she leaned forward, brushing a tender kiss over Rio’s lips. “You’ll be just as much a part of them, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, her voice barely above a whisper as she murmured, “I think that’s what I’m most afraid of.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back slightly, her hand moving to cradle Rio’s face. “What’s there to be afraid of?” she asked, her voice gentle yet firm, trying to pierce through the shadows of doubt in Rio’s gaze. “You’ll be an incredible mother. Fierce, protective… and probably more patient than I will be,” she added with a soft laugh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips quirked in a faint smile, but her eyes betrayed her lingering uncertainty. “Death doesn’t nurture, Agatha,” she said, her voice laced with quiet resignation. “I’ve always been the end of things, not the beginning.” She looked down, tracing Agatha’s fingers with her own, as if the answer might be hidden in the lines of her lover’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand covered hers, warm and steady. “But love does,” she whispered. “You are so much more than your duty, Rio. You’ve given me a chance to be strong, to heal, to live more fully. And that’s what you’ll give to our child, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes, her features softening as Agatha’s words washed over her, soothing the uncertainty that twisted within. She wanted to believe it, to hold onto this fragile hope that had begun to bloom inside her like the flowers she brought Agatha. She opened her eyes, still uncertain, but a glimmer of warmth shone there, a faint ember of belief beginning to take root.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers traced gentle circles over Rio’s hand, anchoring her. “Now, back to the question,” she teased lightly, hoping to lighten the mood. “Boy or girl? Any preferences?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head thoughtfully, a faint smirk tugging at her lips as she considered it. “Well,” she began, “if it’s a girl, I suppose we’ll have someone to inherit your stubbornness. This world needs more women who are strong and unafraid of their power. And if it’s a boy, well… then perhaps he’ll learn all of my terrible habits, just to give you endless grief. Perhaps he’ll be harsh until he meets someone who turns him into a hopeless romantic that brings them flowers every day.” Her expression softened, the smirk giving way to something genuine and tender. “But honestly… no. I already couldn’t love them more. They’ll be ours, and that’s all I need to know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile was radiant, filled with love and quiet pride. “Then I suppose we’ll just have to wait and see,” she whispered, reaching up to kiss Rio again, their foreheads resting together as they breathed in the warmth and comfort of each other’s presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, her fingers brushing tenderly over Agatha’s belly as if making a silent promise. “I may be afraid, but… I’m going to try, for both of you. I’ll do whatever it takes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha brushed a hand over Rio’s hair, soothing her. “And that’s more than enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed and rolled them to their sides, draping one arm protectively over Agatha and holding her close. Her breath evened out and though Agatha knew that Rio didn’t need to sleep, she was glad she was taking a few moments to rest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lay awake, the quiet weight of her own thoughts settling in. She reached a hand over her stomach, placing it just above where Rio’s still rested, gently tracing small circles as she felt the soft flutter of movement from within. It was a tender, intimate reminder of the life they had created, yet beneath her warmth, a chill ran through her—a shadow of a memory she thought she’d long since buried.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother’s face came to her, unbidden, sharp and cold. Even in her faintest memories, Agatha couldn’t recall her mother’s eyes holding any warmth. It was strange; she had known her mother’s touch, her voice, but never the feeling of being truly loved or cherished. All the tenderness she had found in Rio, she had only once dreamed of knowing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened. She vowed, silently, fiercely, that her child would never know the kind of hollow ache she had felt growing up. She would be a different kind of mother—loving, patient, proud. Their child would know laughter and warmth, encouragement instead of scorn, support instead of judgment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But in the same breath, fear twisted in her chest. Was there any part of her mother within her? Was there a bitterness that could emerge if pushed, some shard of her mother’s cruelty buried deep within? She closed her eyes, willing the doubt to fade, reminding herself that she’d already broken free from her mother’s legacy in so many ways. She had found love in Rio, someone who had shattered the armor Agatha had so long held close to protect herself. And now, in their child, she would pour everything she had learned of love and devotion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thoughts drifted to Rio. A soft smile curved her lips as she imagined Rio’s interactions with their child—playful and tender, Rio’s gentleness hidden beneath her dry humor, her patience unyielding. She could already see Rio, crouched beside a toddling little one, handing them flowers and explaining their meanings with the utmost seriousness, a glint of warmth in her eyes that she never showed to the world. She imagined Rio patiently guiding their child, teaching them strength without harshness, loyalty without obligation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart softened further as she imagined Rio telling their child stories, her low voice weaving tales of bravery and courage, her eyes bright with love. And she knew, deeply and without doubt, that their child would be safe and cherished. Because Rio would protect them with all the fierce loyalty Agatha had come to love, and Agatha would make sure that their child would know, every day, that they were wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted uncomfortably, her whole body was </span>
<em>
<span>always</span>
</em>
<span> uncomfortable now, and turned to face her love. She brushed her fingers over Rio’s sleeping face, the depth of her gratitude swelling up in her. The love they had created was already reshaping the edges of her world, mending wounds she hadn’t even known were still there. With a gentle kiss to Rio’s forehead, she whispered a promise only the night would hear: to be the mother she’d never had, to give their child a life filled with the love that had, against all odds, finally found her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she nestled against Rio once more, burying her head against her chest, she closed her eyes, finding comfort in the warmth they shared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Soon there’d be three of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She listened to the steady rise and fall of Rio’s breathing, the quiet, grounding rhythm that had become her anchor in recent months. The thought of soon becoming a family of three filled her with an almost overwhelming mix of emotions. She imagined their child, bundled close to her, small and warm, with Rio by their side, guiding them and protecting them with a fierce yet gentle hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knew Rio would guard their child with a ferocity that nothing could break.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with that thought came another, quieter one that both comforted and frightened her: how different her own childhood had been. Agatha had always told herself that she was fine, that she’d built herself strong on the foundation of her own resilience. But the idea of offering her child a life so different, so free from the isolation and fear she’d grown up with, brought a pang of something bittersweet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers brushed lightly over Rio’s cheek, her heart swelling with a quiet determination. She would be there for their child in all the ways her own mother hadn’t been. She’d be a constant, a source of strength and warmth, of kindness and encouragement. And when their child faced their own struggles and hurts, as all children do, Agatha would be there—not as a shadow but full in her support, present and unwavering. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a soft sigh, she sank deeper into Rio’s warmth, inhaling deeply the scent of her. Before long, there would be a pair of small feet running across the floor, laughter filling every corner. She could already imagine Rio’s amused grin as their child’s questions inevitably turned into mischievous explorations and little rebellions—rebellions Agatha knew she’d find herself smiling over even as she tried to be stern.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes, her heart wrapped in the warmth of a future she hadn’t dared to dream for herself. She was still tired, her body aching from the weight of the baby and the sleepless nights, but at this moment, she felt a new kind of strength—one that would carry her through each hard day, each long night. For she knew, soon, there would be three of them, bound together by the love she had fought so hard to find.</span>

<p>
<span>To say Rio was displeased was an understatement. She had kept her composure in check as The Fates delivered their message. It would cause even more problems if they saw how much her supposed neutrality had been compromised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But as soon as they stopped their chant and vanished, Rio allowed herself to feel the rage pierce through her. So strong was her fury that she could heel her domain shifting and warping in response. She heard the crash and rumble of buildings collapsing to be swallowed by the ground. She didn’t care. She’d let it all crumble if she had to</span>
<em>
<span>. “A mother’s greatest treason,” </span>
</em>
<span>indeed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned the prophecy over in her mind. The Fates always spoke truths however cloaked and obfuscated they may be. But they were truths all the same. That’s why she had called upon them and asked, “Tell me of our child.” Having found no other more clever solution she tossed her line out into the web of existence and fortune. The danger of looking into the void is what you will find looking back at you.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“He must remain among the blooms,”</span>
</em>
<span> didn’t seem very open to interpretation. In order to be safe, their child, their </span>
<em>
<span>son</span>
</em>
<span>, would need to be kept in the mortal world. There were no blooming fields here. And if he never saw this place fully, that would resolve the matter of </span>
<em>
<span>“a child of darkness”</span>
</em>
<span> not being able to look behind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grimaced, poking her cheek with her tongue as a brutal finality sank in. This was it then. They would have their child. But he would be restricted to the overworld alone. Never would he bring light to the shadowed walls here. Never could he visit the places where his mothers had woven the love story that created him. Rio scowled as her stomach twisted with another sick realization.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She would never get to share her life, her domain, everything she had built with her son. The cold sickly feeling constricted around her heart as she reached another certainty. If their son must stay on the surface, he needed his mother with him. Agatha could not leave him alone. And Rio couldn’t keep him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All the visions she’d allowed herself to imagine of the three of them, together as a family, shattered. Her love, her two greatest loves, would walk together. And again, as it always was, and always would be, Death would walk alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had been a fool ever to consider any other path for herself. This was always how it ended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In letting herself fall for the witch who had stumbled into her world, she had damned them both.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart twisted viciously as she nearly cried out in pain. How could she possibly explain </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> to Agatha? How could she tell her that the love she felt was the strongest power she held, but </span>
<em>
<span>still wouldn’t be enough</span>
</em>
<span> to wield against Fate’s decree? How to explain that a child meant to be raised together, would carry more of Agatha’s influence than her own?</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She will walk in light, and I will remain here, as I always have.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>But she wasn’t ready to relinquish this last part of their time together, not just yet. She would make one final plea to the seasons, to the world above, a small gift to Agatha, a chance to welcome their son in the warm embrace of summer. She would delay Agatha’s return as long as possible, allowing the earth to hold her, the child to be born in warmth and light. Perhaps, this way, she could offer Agatha some solace, even if she could never be there to see it herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The only way to sever Agatha’s bond to the underworld was to break their pact. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She would have to undo the vow she had made in exchange for Agatha’s coven’s safety—now that Agatha’s ties to that coven were gone that protection had lost its meaning anyway. Perhaps the world would shift, the seasons strain, and her realm might grow colder with the loss of that warmth. But the Fates had been clear, and her family deserved a chance to live freely in the sunlight, without the tether of darkness pulling her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But how to tell her? How could she possibly explain that the world they had built, would soon be lost? How to explain that their son would never know this place? That he would only know his mother from the stories Agatha would tell of her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pictured the way Agatha’s face would fall when she told her this. There was no way to soften it. No way to make her understand that it wasn’t her love that had faltered, but the cruel nature of her own being—bound to endings, bound to separation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taking a steadying breath, Rio summoned all the resolve within her. When the time came, she would spin the best version of this truth she could manage, something that might at least offer Agatha a sliver of hope and comfort as she moved forward without her. She would tell her of the warm summer that awaited them, of their son’s need for sunlight and blooming fields. How she wanted his first vision to be of the mothers who loved him surrounded by flowers in the little cabin found just for them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She would leave out the last piece—that the underworld would soon close to Agatha forever, leaving Rio with only a memory of the light that had once graced her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hand moved reflexively to her chest, where the ache was sharpest. She straightened, pressing her fingers against it as if to absorb the pain. For Agatha. For their son. They would live in the light, and she would remain here, cloaked in shadows, watching over them from a distance that would never shrink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One day, Agatha would hate her for this. But if it meant that their son could live, untouched by the darkness that had once claimed her, then that would be enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio returned to the cabin carrying a small bouquet of flowers. Red carnations for everlasting love and devotion. Heather for protection from harm and good fortune. In the center a single daisy, new beginnings, and forgiveness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re late,” Agatha said, concern marking her features as Rio breezed through the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Rio paused, she would need to choose every word carefully. “I’ve been thinking…” She made her way to Agatha and kissed her cheek. These little mundane rituals she would miss most. “Maybe it would be nice for the kid’s first impression of life to be… I don’t know, a beautiful summer sunset instead of creepy darkness?” Rio continued her playful tone, this was the most important performance she’d ever given. “I don’t think anyone up here would mind if summer lasted just a little bit longer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled hopefully at Agatha. Hoping, praying, that she would accept this idea, encourage it, or simply be too tired to question her further.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head thoughtfully. “You can do that? Just change the pact? I thought that wasn’t allowed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged playfully, “Eh. I’m already giving you special treatment by bending the rules to come visit as often as I do. What’s the difference if I do it a little longer.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Please, Agatha. Trust me. Don’t question this. Let us have just a little more peace.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, as long we’re together, I don’t care where we are,” Agatha said finally, smiling adoringly at her love. “Can you put some tea on?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s shoulders relaxed, relief washing over her like a quiet tide. Agatha had accepted her proposal with that open-hearted trust, the same trust that had disarmed Rio from the beginning. She placed the bouquet on the table beside Agatha, lingering for a moment to gently brush her fingers along Agatha’s cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Of course my love, coming right up," she said, trying to keep her tone light. Her hands moved on autopilot, filling the kettle, lighting the stove, and arranging the tea leaves. The quiet routine settled her nerves slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Glancing back at Agatha, who had settled back into her chair, her eyes weary but soft, Rio felt the ache in her chest intensify. She wanted to remember every small detail of these moments—the quiet smiles, the ease between them, the promise that somehow lingered in the air of the cabin, even if it was one she could never keep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kettle whistled, snapping her back to the present. She poured the tea into two delicate mismatched mugs. Carrying the tray over, she handed her the cup, allowing their fingers to brush for just a moment longer than necessary.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was it—the beginning of the end she’d quietly dreaded. But the decision was made, and the spell was already forming in her mind. Still, she sat beside Agatha, fingers intertwined, savoring the fleeting closeness that would soon be all she had left of her beloved.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“We should be married.” Agatha’s words cut through the stillness of the night. She felt Rio stiffen next to her.</p><p>Rio’s eyes darted to Agatha as a deeply confused look spread across her face. “What’s that now sweetheart?”</p><p>“You heard me,” Agatha huffed as if she couldn’t be bothered to explain more.</p><p>Next to her in bed, Rio sat up, the sheets falling to pool at her waist as she turned and looked at Agatha. “What do you mean, we should be married?” Her brow furrowed slightly. She wasn’t sure if Agatha was serious or if this was just some idle thought.</p><p>Agatha shot her an annoyed look in return, “What do you mean, what do I mean?”</p><p>“I mean, why do you think we should define our relationship by mortal standards when you and I both know that what we have is so much more than that?”</p><p>Agatha was touched by the pure sweetness of Rio’s words. <em> Of course </em>, this wasn’t something Rio had even considered. She rolled her eyes at herself. Pregnancy was not suiting her. It was reawakening all the anxious parts of her that made her question if she was deserving of any of this. She just had so much love to carry. Realizing her sharpness, and taking in her love’s confused face, she grumbled and snuggled closer. She rest her head in Rio’s lap and roughly pulled her hand to her hair. A command and a plea for Rio to soothe her insecurities.</p><p>Rio understood and scratched gently at her temples, weaving her hands through her hair. Trying to defuse the tension, she took a chance with a gentle tease, “If you’re worried about what people will say, my love, I’m pretty sure Death’s child will be seen as a bastard whether he’s born out of wedlock or not.” </p><p>The woman in her lap huffed but did not pull away. “That’s not funny.”</p><p>Rio shook her head fondly, hand still playing in Agatha’s hair. She loved this woman so much. When she was fierce. When she was insecure. When she was cocky, self-righteous, and vicious. When she was doting, soft, and serene. She sighed softly. She was extremely reluctant to make any more tenuous promises but also was unable to ever deny the woman she held anything.</p><p>“Okay, Agatha. So are you asking, or are you telling?”</p><p>Agatha turned and looked up at her, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>She rephrased her question, “Are you asking me to marry you, or are you telling me you want to be married,” she said softly. She smiled gently at her. She didn’t need a man-made title to define their relationship. But if it would make Agatha happy she would do so gladly. </p><p>Agatha grumbled again and shifted slightly. She wouldn’t be so moody if she wasn’t so damn uncomfortable all the time.</p><p>“I don’t know. It’s silly. Just forget it––” Her deflection was stopped as Rio cupped her cheek, shaking her head slightly.</p><p>“Don’t do that. If it’s important to you, it isn’t silly.” Rio stroked her thumb over Agatha’s jaw. “If you want to be my wife, then I’ll be yours,” she promised gently.</p><p>“Are you asking me or telling me?” Agatha teased back, always clinging to a bit of petulance.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and lifted Agatha’s hand to her mouth, kissing her finger tenderly. She had done this once before and a daisy chain ring had blossomed. A sweet promise. This time, as her lips drew back, Agatha watched as a band of dark ebony wood curled its way around her finger.</p><p>“Will you?” Rio asked slyly.</p><p>Agatha took their joined hands and mirrored Rio, pressing a kiss to her hand in the same place. Here, two sprigs of yew intertwined and formed a braided band.</p><p>“Will you?” she breathed, tears welling slightly at the tender moment. Perhaps Rio had done this to humor her. But when she looked into her lover’s eyes she knew without a doubt that she was just as affected by this moment.</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>With Rio’s help, Agatha sat up in bed, turning to kiss her. The kiss was perhaps the softest that they had ever shared.</p><p>After a moment, Rio looked down at their joined hands. A teasing smile quirked her lips before she turned to Agatha and said in mock seriousness, “You know I prefer a thinner band.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and rolled her eyes, kissing her love, <em> her wife </em>, again just to shut up her teasing. “Never mind, I change my mind. I can’t stand you,” she shot back, still beaming.</p><p>“No way. No take backs. Till death do us part,” Rio teased, tickling her side gently. “And I say no.”</p><p>They fell back together, Agatha’s head resting on her chest. Both of Rio’s arms wrapped around her like a shield. </p><p>Agatha fell asleep quickly, still smiling. She wasn’t awake long enough to see her wife’s face fall with the added weight of this new promise.</p><p>As she watched Agatha drift back into sleep, a soft smile still gracing her lips, Rio held her close, her fingers absently tracing patterns along Agatha's arm. The quiet settled around them like a blanket, the only sounds in the room the slow, even breaths of her now-wife and the faint crackle of the fire. Her gaze lingered on the wooden ring around Agatha’s finger, an unbreakable circle—quite unlike the promise she’d just made. One she feared would break under the weight of fate.</p><p>The Fates’ warning echoed in her mind, each word carving itself deeper into her thoughts. <em> "A mother’s greatest treason." </em> She shivered, tightening her hold on Agatha as if she could keep her there forever. What kind of mother would she be to break her vows for the child she hadn’t even met yet? And yet, Rio’s loyalty, her love, was rooted so deeply in Agatha that it felt like a piece of her own soul. She would do anything to protect her.</p><p>And that was the promise she could never tell Agatha.</p><p>Lifting her head, Rio pressed a feather-light kiss to Agatha’s hair. In her sleep, Agatha murmured softly, nestling closer, as if sensing Rio’s touch even in her dreams. The sight of her, so peaceful and trusting, eased some of the weight in Rio's heart but only for a moment.</p><p>Closing her eyes, Rio whispered words only the night would hear, a private vow to the woman in her arms and the child in her womb: <em> "I’ll give you all I can, for as long as I can. And I swear—I’ll make sure our child will know, even if he only has you, that he is loved." </em></p><p>As Agatha sighed in her sleep, Rio pulled her closer. She needed to leave soon. This was too much. It wasn’t enough. For the first time in a long time, she felt the familiar dread of a ticking clock.</p><p>It wouldn’t be long now.</p><hr/><p>It would be any day now. Agatha felt this with certainty. </p><p>Tomorrow, the next, perhaps even today. Their child would be here soon. She was excited. She was terrified. She was more than a little annoyed at her wife.</p><p>Rio hadn’t been around in almost a week. It worried her. She understood that she’d probably been incredibly busy. The prolonged summer of this year had brought wildfire and drought. Farmers had scrambled to pick overripe fruit before it was scorched under the heat of the sun. She knew that was because of her, because of them.</p><p>But nevertheless, the thought of bringing this child into the world alone scared her. She stayed close to the cabin, not daring to venture deeper into the woods no matter how badly she wished to find Rio there. She had to be patient. Rio would come.</p><p>There wasn’t a world in which she would miss the birth of their child.</p><p>Agatha tried to keep her mind occupied, pacing the small cabin and smoothing the folds of the old quilt Rio had brought for their child. She hadn’t thought too hard about where she might have found it. She trailed her fingers along the window frame, eyes drifting to the woods. She imagined Rio moving through the trees, a figure swathed in shadows and sunlight, her cool presence bringing an air of calm and control that Agatha desperately needed.</p><p>But the worry gnawed at her. Each passing hour, each creak of the floorboards, each whisper of wind made her heart race with a hope she tried not to let slip into doubt.</p><p>The prolonged summer had begun to feel like an omen. She had thought it was a blessing—a chance for their child to be born under a gentle sky, in a world that felt full of warmth and life. But as the days grew hotter and the wildfires spread, Agatha couldn’t ignore the cost. She knew the land was suffering, stretching itself thin to accommodate this unnatural warmth, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something might break if it went on much longer.</p><p>The trees outside seemed to pulse with her thoughts, the leaves still green but curled, like they were bracing themselves against an inevitable end.</p><p>She was trying to convince herself, telling herself Rio was fine, that this absence was just a part of their unusual life. Yet, in moments of silence, her mind whispered doubts—what if something had happened? What if Rio was being held back, her powers split too thin as the seasons strained and cracked? The Fates had warned of treachery; was this Rio’s way of shielding her?</p><p><em> No, </em> she thought stubbornly, her hands protectively covering her belly. <em> Rio would come. She would keep her promise.</em> She had to be patient. Rio would come. They would welcome this child as they had created him, together.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes drifted to the edge of the forest, where the shadows thickened and tangled among the trees. She felt a pang of longing. She ached for the steadying weight of her presence, the sense of protection she could offer with just a glance, especially now, with her every nerve fraying as she awaited the child she could already feel shifting restlessly within her.</p><p>She held her belly, murmuring softly to the life stirring under her palm. “Soon,” she whispered, more for herself than for him. “Your mother will be here soon.”</p><p>Agatha forced herself to sit, to keep her breaths slow and even, but as another hour slipped by, her patience wore thin. Every little noise from the woods outside made her heart leap with hope, only for it to plummet when nothing followed. The cabin felt smaller by the minute, the walls pressing in with the weight of her anticipation and growing fear. She wanted to call for Rio, to reach out with every ounce of magic she possessed and demand her presence.</p><p>She would’ve lashed out with her magic and delivered a hundred souls if it meant she would see her love walk through the door.</p><p>As the sun began to dip low in the sky, Agatha’s anxiety shifted to exhaustion, a deep weariness settling into her bones. She lit a single candle and watched its soft glow spread across the room, casting a gentle warmth over the bed and the small cradle she had prepared. She was so tired, but her mind wouldn’t let her rest. She felt another pang of a contraction that left her breathless and gasping. Still, she stayed alert, her heart beating in rhythm with her child’s soft movements.</p><p>Just as dusk fell and she began to wonder if she’d have to endure another night alone, there was a rustling at the edge of the clearing. Agatha tensed, breath catching, every sense sharpening as her eyes darted toward the door. The shadows shifted, and then—she saw her.</p><p>“Rio!” she cried out, her face contorting in pain as she felt something different twist inside her.</p><p>Sweat broke out across her forehead. She looked up feverishly, like some wild thing. Why hadn’t she come in? Why was her love’s cool hands not upon her, settling her, comforting her. Something was wrong.</p><p>Rio stood just at the threshold, caught between coming and going. Between life and death. Here she was.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened with realization and her hand flew to cover her mouth. “No. No!”</p><p>For the first time, Rio felt Agatha look upon her, not with love but horror. It was familiar. She'd known it was coming. It killed her all the same.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said, her voice unnaturaly cool and calm, “my love, it’s going to be alright. But I need you to trust me.”</p>

<p>
<span>Rio wished she had been able to come willingly. That she’d come to the cabin carrying an armful of flowers, taken her wife into her arms, and held her and supported her through the birth of their boy. They would’ve been so happy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There had been one last soul to gather before she was to break off and rush to be with her love. But as she stepped out of the shadows onto the earth, she immediately realized where she had been called. And noose around her throat, she stepped off the gallows herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In doing so, she killed a part of herself. She buried the tears. She forced her face into a neutral expression. She bit the scar inside her cheek until she tasted blood with grim satisfaction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There were precious few moments to collect herself. Agatha, their child, they still needed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wouldn’t break what they had built. She’d sooner break herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened the door, pausing as she saw Agatha. She was so beautiful. Even though she had been caught, she couldn’t yet make herself do what she must. Just another moment. One more selfishness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That ended as soon as Agatha, always too clever Agatha, looked upon her with realization. With fear, and horror. She’d never wanted her to look like that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. No!” Agatha cried, half scrambling backward. For the first time she was willingly pulling away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio said, her voice unnaturaly cool and calm, “my love, it’s going to be alright. But I need you to trust me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My love, please! You can’t take him! Please! He’s your <em>son</em>!” Agatha wept, cradling her stomach protectively even as her body twisted with another contraction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped towards her and knelt beside her. Agatha flinched and Rio wondered how many times in one day her heart could shatter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” she said softly. “Please. Let me help you. There are still things I can do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her warily, but instinct took over and she grabbed Rio’s hand in hers squeezing it tightly as she screamed again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, listen to me. I can give you time. I can give that to you both.” Rio whispered, brushing the hair from her face. “I can’t give you everything I promised. And I am so, so, sorry. But you’re going to have this baby. We’re going to do this together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held onto Rio’s hand with all the strength she had left, her breath ragged, her face a pure expression of pain and fear. Her mind was spinning, trying to reconcile the woman before her—the love who had promised to be by her side—with the looming shadow of death that had suddenly appeared, not for her but for their child. She gritted her teeth, every fiber of her being railing against what she knew Rio would eventually ask of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re <em>not</em> taking him from me,” Agatha said, her voice trembling, defiant even in her weakness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not,” Rio said firmly, her own voice thick with barely concealed pain. “He’s yours, Agatha. I would never take him from you. But… he can’t stay here forever. We only have so much time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes blazed with a fierce protectiveness. “Then don’t take him from me. Don’t you dare. He needs us both, Rio. He deserves—he deserves a life!” She growled with the ferocious protectiveness that only mothers carry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her composure slip, felt the icy veneer crack. She wanted nothing more than to give her that life, to find some loophole, some way to rewrite Fate itself. But this story was already written. This was all she had. Every rule, every binding contract of her existence demanded this parting, even if it tore her apart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He will have that life, Agatha,” she promised, her voice choked. “It’s not everything I wanted to give him, to give you. But I’ll fight to give him as much time as I can.” She tightened her grip on Agatha’s hand, grounding them both in the here and now. “Right now, he needs you. He needs both of us. So let’s bring him into this world together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another contraction seized Agatha, and she doubled over, squeezing Rio’s hand with desperate strength. Rio whispered words of comfort, soothing her, grounding her as best she could. She stayed by her side, offering soft reassurances, brushing the damp hair from Agatha’s face, pressing her forehead to hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bore down, her breaths coming in frantic gasps, her body arching with the effort. With every ounce of strength, she pushed. Rio murmured words of encouragement, a steady presence through the storm of pain. Time blurred, a rush of agony and endurance, until finally, a small, piercing cry filled the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s tears spilled over, her breath catching as Rio placed their child—a tiny, fragile boy—into her arms. His skin was soft and warm, his eyes squeezed shut, and for a moment, every shadow, every threat, faded in the presence of their son’s first breaths.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s perfect,” Agatha whispered, her voice trembling with awe and love.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched them, feeling a mixture of pride and despair twist within her. She reached out, lightly brushing her fingers over their son’s forehead. “He is,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. She couldn’t look away, drinking in the sight of Agatha holding their child, of this family she had never thought possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up at her, her expression softening as she seemed to understand the depth of Rio’s grief. She placed her free hand over Rio’s, squeezing gently, as if to tether her to this moment, to this reality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My love,” she whispered, her voice tender. “We’ll find a way, won’t we? For him. For us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wanted to promise her that they would, to say she’d never let anything come between them. But the words caught in her throat. She felt the constraints of her power, the inevitability of what she was. The lie tasted bitter, so she said nothing, only brushing a kiss to Agatha’s forehead and cradling them both with a gentleness that betrayed every broken piece of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t stay here my love. I have to find someone else to take with me.” This was a cold certainty. There was a balance to maintain. A life for a life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not him though. Right?” Agatha looked up still pleading, unable to allow herself to believe that they would escape this snare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked back tears and shook her head. “Not him. Not today. I will stay away. For as long as I possibly can.” The words shattered her. Yes, she would give up everything for them. “You understand what that means, right Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her heart constrict, the weight of Rio’s words settling in. She held their son close, her fingers tightening instinctively around him as if to guard him from the truth that was slowly unfurling. She understood what Rio was telling her, what she was sacrificing. They could keep their child, safe and whole, but at a devastating cost.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed hard, her voice barely above a whisper. “It means… you can’t stay with us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes softened, the grief in them cutting deep. She didn’t say anything, just brushed a gentle hand over Agatha’s cheek, her thumb catching a tear that Agatha hadn’t even realized had fallen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their baby cried between them and they both moved to soothe him. Agatha cradled him, Rio rocked them both.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t be here like this,” Rio whispered, her voice breaking on the words. “Not without… tipping the balance. This world—it needs life. And I… I am what comes after.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart twisted. She knew that it was true, had always known what Rio was, what her presence in the world meant. But to hear it now, with their son in her arms, felt like a wound she would never fully heal from. She pressed her lips to their son’s soft, downy head, inhaling his scent, memorizing every detail of this moment that would be a balm and a curse in the days to come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How am I supposed to… how am I supposed to go on without you?” she whispered, her voice raw, broken.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand tightened over hers. “You’ll have him. And he’ll have you,” she said, her voice filled with all the love and sorrow she could not hold back. “And I will be here, as much as I can. I’ll be in every breeze, every shadow, every night that passes.” She drew closer, brushing her lips over Agatha’s knuckles, her forehead resting against hers. “I know it’s not </span>
<em>
<span>enough</span>
</em>
<span>. It’s not what either of us wanted. My love, it’s all I have left to give.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s shoulders shook with the weight of it. She clung to Rio, needing to feel her warmth, needing to absorb her strength. She would do this, she would carry this burden of separation if it meant their son could live, could have a future. But the thought of living with only half of her heart, torn between worlds, was almost unbearable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, it’s not enough,” she whispered, her voice thick. “But I’d rather live a life split in two than not have you in it at all. He’s yours, Rio. He’s ours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes, her own tears falling silently. She wanted to hold them both, to keep them safe forever. But she was Death, and Death did not belong in this world of summers and gentle mornings and new life. She cupped Agatha’s face, pressing a kiss to her forehead, letting the touch linger as if it could somehow imprint into her skin, stay with her always.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Raise him to know who he is, Agatha. To know that he is loved, fiercely and without end. And tell him about us,” she murmured, her voice trembling, “about who we were, and what we had.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, the tears streaming down her face. “I’ll tell him every story,” she promised, her voice a choked whisper. “I’ll tell him about the way you look at me, the way you always made me feel safe, and loved, and whole. I’ll tell him about the garden. I’ll tell him about you… my beautiful, impossible wife.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitched, and she pulled Agatha close, wrapping them both in an embrace that felt like the beginning and end of everything. They stayed like that, holding each other, memorizing every heartbeat, every shiver, every tear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio pulled back, her hand lingering over their son, her fingers tracing his tiny features with a tenderness that broke her. “You’ll be safe, little one,” she whispered, the words a promise, a vow. “And you’ll </span>
<em>
<span>always</span>
</em>
<span> know how loved you are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked back at Agatha, her gaze full of fierce, unyielding love. “I will come back,” she said, her voice soft but resolute. “Even if only in whispers, even if only in glimpses. I will find a way to be with you, both of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with a final, lingering kiss, she slipped from the cabin, leaving Agatha cradling their son, her heart torn in two.</span>

<p>
<span>“Mommy, look!” Nicholas ran to her on the porch, little fists full of flowers he had ripped from the earth with clumps of dirt still clinging to their roots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused, turning away from the clothes she was hanging on the line as he came bounding up to her. “Wow, what beautiful flowers! Let me see what you’ve got!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas held his fists out, proudly showing her his bouquet. The sight made her heart ache and swell all at once—she knew Rio must have left them, carefully arranging them along his usual path through the woods. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, my love,” Agatha said, crouching to his level, brushing some of the dirt off the stems. “Do you remember what they mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas grinned, puffing up with pride. “The yellow one’s for friendship, right?” he said, holding up a wild yellow primrose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded, smiling as she brushed a stray dark curl from his forehead. He’d gotten Rio’s dark hair but carried her same thick and messy mane. “That’s right. What else?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He carefully picked out a bluebell from his messy bundle, holding it up with a steady seriousness. “This one… this one’s for kindness?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Very close, love,” Agatha murmured, cupping his hand. “It’s actually for gratitude, for saying ‘thank you.’” She glanced at the flower, her own heart caught in her chest. “It’s the kind of flower someone leaves when they want you to know they’re grateful for something very special.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas looked up at her, curiosity flashing in his bright blue eyes. “Grateful for me?” he asked, his voice softening with wonder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart squeezed, and she reached out to brush her hand over his hair. “Yes, my darling,” she whispered. “Very grateful for you. For all that you are.” She paused, her voice catching as she took his hand, guiding his gaze back to the flowers. “And for all the joy you bring.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He seemed satisfied, returning his attention to the flowers and poking at the cluster left in his little fist. “What about this one?” He held up a dark purple hellebore, its petals delicate in his small hands. “Does this one mean anything too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her eyes softening. </span>
<em>
<span>Love and devotion, </span>
</em>
<span>the flower whispered to her, and yet… there was something bittersweet in that meaning. The hellebore was also a sign of a promise and, sometimes, of a love that couldn’t stay close. She had taught him about it before, but she could see he had forgotten.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It means love, and a promise,” she said quietly. “A promise that’s never broken, even when someone has to go away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas’s brows furrowed, and he held the flower close, turning it over thoughtfully. “Like… like when you tell me stories about Mami?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her throat tighten, a lump forming that was both sweet and painful. “Yes, just like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He gazed down at the hellebore for a long moment before a smile broke across his face. “Then I’ll keep it safe,” he declared, carefully tucking the flower behind his ear. “So she knows I love her back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand trembled slightly as she reached out, resting her palm on his cheek, feeling the warmth and life of him, so real and solid and here. “Oh, she knows, my love. She knows very well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas beamed, his gaze lifting to the sky, where soft clouds drifted across the deepening blue. He reached for her hand, and Agatha held onto it tightly, her heart full of both the love and sorrow that was her constant state as they stood together on the porch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, she swore she felt a gentle breeze curl around them, a soft warmth she knew was no mere coincidence. Rio’s love was here, just as present as the flowers their son held in his hand, lingering between the earth and sky, never far away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>True to her word, though it had been four years since she’d seen her wife, she never felt far from them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had found a way to remain close, like a hidden seam stitching their lives together. Even as years passed, Agatha saw her handiwork everywhere, in the small signs of love she left behind. Like gentle ghosts that guided and comforted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every spring, a patch of violets would bloom at the edge of the woods, even though they had never taken root there before. It was a small, quiet miracle—delicate purple flowers pushing up through the soil, as if Rio herself had coaxed them into life. Agatha would watch Nicholas find them, giggling as he picked handfuls to give to her, his eyes bright with a joy that felt like it had come directly from his other mother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On stormy nights, when thunder cracked loud enough to make him jump in bed, Agatha would soothe him, murmuring promises that he was safe. And just as she did, the wind would soften, the harsh flashes of lightning dimming to a muted glow as if a hand had cupped the sky. She could feel Rio’s presence in that calm. A familiar gentleness wrapped around them both. Agatha had long since stopped wondering if it was a coincidence—she knew her wife’s touch when she felt it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even in the kitchen, Agatha found little hints of her love. On days that seemed endless, with chores piling up and Nicholas needing more attention than she had to give, she would open the pantry and find fresh herbs hanging from the rafters. Herbs that she hadn’t gathered herself. Sage and rosemary, lavender and thyme, all ready to be used in soothing teas and healing balms. Agatha would touch the leaves with reverence, her fingers brushing over the stems as she whispered her thanks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And sometimes, on quiet mornings, she’d catch a whiff of something familiar—a scent she couldn’t quite place, but one that reminded her of Rio. It was like the smell of rain mixed with the rich, deep scent of earth. Petrichor, oak, and a touch of lily. She’d breathe it in, closing her eyes and feeling as though her love was standing just behind her, hands resting on her shoulders. She didn’t dare turn around, afraid the feeling would vanish like smoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas, too, seemed to sense these things. Once, after a winter snowstorm, they had gone out to play in the fresh drifts, and he’d spotted a trail of frost-covered footprints leading up to their front door and then disappearing into the woods. “Look, Mommy!” he’d exclaimed, his voice brimming with excitement. “Mami was here!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had laughed, brushing the snow off his cheeks, but a part of her believed it. She could picture Rio’s steps in the snow, her lingering glance back toward the cabin before retreating into the safety of the shadows. Agatha had to wipe a tear from her cheek when Nicholas wasn’t looking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On special days, like birthdays or the first day of spring, a single raven feather would appear on the windowsill. Agatha would find him proudly holding it, his fingers tracing its glossy surface with wonder. “For luck,” he’d say confidently, as though he knew exactly what it meant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha would tuck it into his book of pressed flowers and plants, where they kept a small collection of memories that Rio had quietly left for them. These were their keepsakes, small mementos that reminded them she was always watching, always keeping them safe in whatever way she could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was enough, sometimes, to feel her so close in these little ways. But on quiet nights, when Nicholas had long since fallen asleep, Agatha would sit alone by the fire and ache for her. She’d close her eyes and whisper into the darkness, hoping her voice could carry to wherever Rio was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I miss you,” she would say, her voice catching. “I love you. Always.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And sometimes, in those rare, fragile moments, the fire would flicker, a gentle warmth would brush against her skin, and she’d feel it—the unmistakable, lingering presence of the woman she loved, like a promise of her eventual return.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One evening, just as Agatha was settling down by the fire, she heard small footsteps padding softly across the floor. Nicholas appeared at her side, his arms wrapped around his book of pressed flowers and feathers. His eyes were sleepy, but a spark of curiosity kept him awake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mommy?” he murmured, clutching the book to his chest as he climbed into her lap. “Will you tell me a story about Mami?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart softened as she wrapped her arms around him, holding him close. She kissed the top of his head, breathing in the warm, familiar scent of him as she considered which story to tell. There were so many memories, so many pieces of their life she had tucked away, waiting for moments like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, let me think,” she said, leaning back and gazing into the fire, which flickered a little brighter as if it were waiting, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did I ever tell you about the time your mami taught me about shadeblooms?” she began, and Nicholas shook his head, eyes wide with anticipation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shadeblooms? Like the ones in the garden?” he asked, a spark of recognition lighting up his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, exactly. But the first time I saw them was in a garden deep in the Underworld, in Mami’s special place,” she continued. “You see, they were her favorite flowers, but they only bloom in the dark. And just like her, they’re stubborn and resilient, thriving where nothing else will grow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas snuggled closer, his head resting against her chest as he listened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was a little scared at first,” Agatha admitted, her voice low and warm, weaving the story just so. “The Underworld was full of shadows, and everything felt so still and quiet. But your mami... she held my hand, and she told me not to be afraid. She said that the shadeblooms could sense when someone was scared and that, if I stayed brave, they would bloom for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas tilted his head up to look at her, his eyes shining. “Did they bloom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, yes,” Agatha replied, her smile softening with the memory. “She whispered something to them—something only she knew. And then, right before my eyes, the garden came to life. One by one, the blooms opened up, their petals so dark they were almost black, with tiny silver veins glowing like starlight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas’s mouth dropped open in wonder, and he hugged his book tightly to his chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled softly, brushing her fingers through his hair. “Your mami always knew how to make the impossible seem ordinary. She could bring life where there was none, make flowers bloom in darkness. I think, even now, she’s still leaving pieces of herself for us, like those little flowers in the garden. She’s with us, even when we can’t see her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas was silent for a long moment, looking into the fire with a thoughtful expression. Finally, he looked up at her, his voice small and filled with hope. “Do you think she’s watching us now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath, her heart aching with both love and the bittersweet distance that had become her constant companion. She wanted so desperately to believe that Rio could see them, that her love was woven into their lives in every small, quiet way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know she is,” she whispered, her voice trembling as she hugged him close. “She’s always watching, always loving us. And whenever you feel something special—a breeze on your cheek, or a shadow moving just so, or even a feather by your window—know that it’s her, reminding us she’s here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas smiled, his little fingers reaching up to touch the raven feather tucked behind his ear. He leaned his head against her, comforted, his breaths slowing as he began to drift off to sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stayed there with him, feeling the warmth of his small body against hers, and, for just a moment, she could almost sense Rio beside her, her love filling the room like a promise, unbroken even by time and distance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The day after his sixth birthday, Nicholas asked her a question that froze her heart. “Mommy, what does ‘te veo’ mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught. She looked down at Nicholas, who was watching her with wide, curious eyes, completely unaware of the weight his innocent question had brought crashing down on her heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where… where did you hear that, love?” she managed, trying to keep her voice steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He gave her a small, lopsided smile, shrugging his shoulders as if it were the most natural thing in the world. He looked so much like his mother, Rio, in that moment. “I hear it sometimes when I’m in the woods. It’s like a whisper. ‘Te veo.’” He pronounced the words with delicate care, as though the phrase itself was fragile, something precious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's heart ached with a mix of joy and sorrow. She knew those words as well as her own name. Rio had spoken them to her a thousand times, each with its own meaning—</span>
<em>
<span>I see you, I love you, I am with you. </span>
</em>
<span>Words they had spoken in shadows, in shared glances, and in moments too fragile to last.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gently, she reached out, brushing a hand through his dark hair. “It means ‘I see you,’” she murmured, her voice thick with emotion. “It’s… a way of saying that someone cares deeply, that they’re watching over you. It’s something your mami and I used to say to each other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas tilted his head thoughtfully, looking back at her with that serious gaze of his. Far too serious for a six-year-old little boy. “So, if she says ‘te veo,’ it means she’s close, right? Even if we can’t see her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, love.” Agatha’s throat tightened. “Even if we can’t see her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas seemed satisfied with that answer, a small smile tugging at his lips as he leaned against her, content. She wrapped her arms around him, pressing a gentle kiss to the top of his head, as if her own embrace could somehow protect him from the sorrow she carried. He was so small, so full of hope, and she wanted more than anything to give him the certainty he longed for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mommy?” he asked, his voice muffled as he snuggled against her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, love?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can we go to the garden tonight? The shadeblooms… they’re always open there. Maybe she’s there, too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, but only for a moment. “Alright,” she whispered, smiling despite the ache in her heart. “We’ll go to the garden.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As night fell, Agatha led Nicholas out into the garden, where the shadeblooms glowed faintly in the moonlight, their petals unfolding like tiny stars against the deep shadows. Nicholas crouched down, touching one of the blooms reverently, as though it held a piece of magic meant just for him. In a way, she supposed it was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The night air felt charged with something unseen, and Agatha closed her eyes, breathing it in. She could almost feel Rio there beside her, the sensation so strong it was as though Rio’s presence lingered just out of reach, wrapped in the night and shadows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas looked up, a sense of awe lighting up his face. “I think she’s watching us,” he whispered, his voice filled with the kind of awe that only a child could muster.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knelt beside him, taking his hand in hers, and together, they sat in the silence of the garden, surrounded by flowers. The night seemed to hold them, wrapping them in a warmth that went beyond what was natural, something that Agatha knew, deep down, was a gift from her wife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Te veo,” Agatha murmured softly, hoping that wherever Rio was, the words would reach her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, a warm breeze stirred the flowers, the petals shifting as though in answer, and a single petal drifted down, landing in Nicholas’s open hand. He looked at it, then at Agatha, his face breaking into a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think… I think she sees us, too,” he said quietly, his voice filled with quiet certainty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t bring herself to speak, her heart too full. So instead, she squeezed his hand, letting the silence speak for them, their love filling the space where words weren’t enough. And in that quiet moment, surrounded by the blooms Rio had left for them, she felt a fragile hope take root—a promise, growing quietly in the dark. She would never stop believing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she knew that her love would never give up.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>From her distant vantage points in the shadows of the woods or on the other side of the veil, Rio watched Nicholas grow. Every milestone, every first word and step, drew her in. It compelled her to stay as close as she dared without breaking the delicate balance she’d sworn to uphold. And every time she saw them, she was filled with pride and a fierce protectiveness over both of them, a need to keep them safe that only grew stronger with each passing year.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She would carry this peace as long as she possibly could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Whenever she saw Agatha teaching Nicholas, her heart swelled with admiration for her wife. Agatha’s patience, her gentleness, her relentless strength—qualities Rio had once witnessed only in fleeting glances and stolen moments—had flourished into something so powerful. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s love was a force that wrapped around their son. It shielded him in a way that only Agatha could. In those quiet moments, Rio’s longing to be beside them became a tangible ache, gnawing at her resolve, challenging her promises.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sometimes, she couldn’t resist the urge to be near them, even just to leave a small token of her love where she knew they would find it. A feather, carefully laid on the windowsill; flowers arranged just so in the garden, mirroring the ones she and Agatha used to nurture together. These tiny gestures were all she could manage, but they were also her way of saying, </span>
<em>
<span>I am here. I am with you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, the more she saw Nicholas and Agatha, the bolder she became in her attempts to catch a glimpse of them. On quiet nights, when the forest grew still, Rio would slip closer to their cabin, close enough to see the soft glow of candlelight in the windows, to hear the echoes of laughter or the faintest lullabies that Agatha would sing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her love for them was both her solace and her torment. An ache that grew sharper each time she was reminded of all she was missing. She’d sit underneath their window for hours, just out of sight but always there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One evening, as Rio lingered at the edge of the clearing, she caught sight of Nicholas wandering near the cabin. She held her breath, watching him curiously examine the berry bushes at the forest’s edge. His small fingers brushed over the not-yet-ripe fruit, and he looked around with an expression that was both thoughtful and eager. As though he were searching for something—or someone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a quiet step back, careful not to disturb even the smallest twig, knowing she couldn’t risk being seen. But as she moved, Nicholas’s head snapped up, his gaze cutting through the shadows of the trees and meeting her own. For a heartbeat, neither of them moved, his eyes wide with surprise and something close to wonder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s instinct was to melt back into the forest, to let the shadows swallow her whole. But the boy’s gaze held her in place, and she found herself rooted to the spot, unable to retreat. He took a tentative step forward, his face lighting up with a recognition that made her heart twist painfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you…” he began, his voice soft and tentative, as if speaking too loudly might shatter the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her throat tightened, and she almost turned away, knowing how dangerous this was, how fragile the threads keeping her here had become. But Nicholas took another step forward, his eyes brimming with the same warmth, the same spark of life she had loved in Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she whispered, her voice barely a breath on the wind. “I’m here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A tentative smile spread across his face, and he reached out, as if trying to bridge the distance between them. “I </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> you’d come,” he said, his voice full of a child’s quiet confidence. “I knew you wouldn’t stay gone forever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wanted nothing more than to step forward, to pull him into her arms and hold him close. But she stopped herself, keeping her distance, her hands clenched tightly at her sides. She could feel the weight of all she couldn’t say, all the warnings and boundaries she’d imposed on herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m… so proud of you, Nicky,” she murmured, her voice breaking just slightly. “You and your mother… you mean everything to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He blinked, and his face softened with something she could only call understanding. He didn’t press her, didn’t move any closer. Instead, he gave her a small, reassuring nod. “We’ll wait for you, Mami,” he said, his voice full of certainty. “Whenever you’re ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart swelled and broke all at once. “Nicholas,” she said seriously. “Don’t tell your mom you saw me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How come?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed, forcing herself to stay calm as she met his innocent, curious gaze. She crouched down, leveling her eyes with his, though she kept herself just within the shadows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because…” She hesitated, trying to find words that would make sense, that wouldn’t hurt him. “Because it’s… hard for your mom to know I’m so close but still have to stay away. I don’t want her to worry. I want her to feel safe. And if she knew I’d been here…” She trailed off, knowing Agatha’s heart as well as her own, knowing the ache her presence would bring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas frowned thoughtfully, the way he did when he was trying to work through one of the many mysteries his mother would guide him through. He nodded slowly, finally seeming to understand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” he said with a seriousness beyond his years. “I won’t say anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s chest tightened, and for a fleeting moment, she allowed herself a small, bittersweet smile. He </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> inherited his mother’s strength, her resilience. Just as they’d hoped he might. She could see Agatha in the way he held himself, the way he met the world with a steady gaze and an open heart. And yet, he had her own quiet, watchful nature too—the willingness to understand even things that hurt, the way he seemed to look past the surface and into the shadows without fear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Nicky.” She reached out a hand, and though she kept it hovering in the air between them, not daring to close the gap, she felt the warmth of his presence like a balm on her heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He smiled back at her, “I knew you’d come one day. Even if it was just to see us for a little while.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll always be watching over you both,” she whispered, feeling the promise etch itself into her very being. “Every day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed that way for a moment longer, gazing at each other with a quiet understanding that only deepened Rio’s resolve. She would keep her distance; she would continue to protect them both, no matter what it cost her. But this moment, this glimpse of her son’s love, would carry her through every aching night, every stolen glance from afar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she stepped back, and Nicholas’s gaze never wavered, his small figure framed by the forest’s edge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goodbye, Mami,” he said softly, his voice filled with more love than she thought she deserved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goodbye, my heart,” she replied, her own voice breaking. “You know… you and your mom—you’re my greatest joy. You’re my light in all the darkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas’s eyes shone, his little face filled with a mix of wonder and pride that made her ache even more. “We love you, Mami,” he said, his voice small but clear, unshakable. “I know you’ll come home someday. Even if we have to wait a long, long time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit her lip, fighting back tears. “You’re so brave, my sweet boy,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “I love you so so much. We both do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas nodded, smiling at her with such certainty it nearly undid her. “I know, Mami,” he whispered, “I feel you everywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed hard, feeling the weight of her heart splinter under his words. She nodded, unable to speak, knowing this moment would have to carry her for years to come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she took a step back, preparing herself to fade into the shadows, she heard his voice one last time, soft and full of love.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Te veo, Mami.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath caught, and for one glorious, heartbreaking moment, she felt seen. She managed a trembling smile, whispering back just before she vanished, “Te veo, Nicky. Always.”</span>

<p>The moonlight filtered softly through the trees, casting a silvery glow over the cabin where Agatha slept. The quiet of the night was thick, the entire world heavy with the weight of what was about to take place. </p><p>Rio stood at the window, watching them—her family. She could see the gentle rise and fall of Agatha’s breath as she lay asleep, blissfully unaware. Nicholas was curled up in his bed, but Rio could feel his heart racing from where she stood, his dreams flickering with the same sense of unease that gnawed at her own chest.</p><p>
<em>It was time.</em>
</p><p>The ache of the decision tore at Rio, but there was nothing she could do. The time for waiting, for watching from the shadows, had passed.</p><p>Death had fought for a delay, but Fate and Nature were winning. She’d found herself intervening more and more frequently as Nicholas grew up and daring. He’d shared several brushes with her even though he had only spotted her the once.</p><p>One night he had slipped out from the cabin, and of course, Rio had followed him The moonlight guided her path, illuminating a small clearing where Nicholas had ventured out, captivated by the glow of fireflies dancing in the night.</p><p>Nicholas stood alone, his eyes wide with wonder as he reached out to touch a particularly bright firefly. Entranced, he didn’t notice the faint trail of smoke curling into the air behind him—a remnant of a nearby campfire that had been left unattended. The dry summer air was perfect for wildfires, and Rio knew the dangers all too well.</p><p>As the smoke began to thicken, swirling around Nicholas’s feet, he coughed, trying to shield his face. Panic flared in his chest as he took a step back, stumbling over a fallen log. Before he could regain his balance, a spark ignited on the ground, and flames began to lick hungrily at the edges of the clearing.</p><p>Rio acted swiftly, her movements fluid and precise. She extended a hand, and a gust of wind surged from her palm, extinguishing the flames before they could consume anything further. The smoke dissipated as quickly as it had appeared.</p><p>The fear in his eyes had broken her and she longed to pull him into her arms and console him. He’d hurried back and woken Agatha up, crying as he apologized to her. She'd soothed him gently, unable to scold him in this moment. Their son felt <em>so</em> deeply. Just like his mothers.</p><p>For seven years Rio had kept the wolves away. She’d isolated plagues, she’d chased off travelers who had stumbled across the cabin, she'd left herbs in the cupboards perfectly suited to cure any small ailment she sensed in him before it could twist into illness.</p><p>Eventually, though, it was not enough. She couldn’t keep away the multiplying threats. And she would not allow her child’s transition to be a painful or scary one.</p><p>Instead, she would try, to gently lead him by the hand. Just a little walk in the woods with his mother.</p><p>With slow, deliberate steps, Rio approached the door, pausing only for a heartbeat. She took in the scattered toys on the porch. One of Agatha's cloaks was draped over the banister and she lifted it to her face and inhaled deeply. She let a tear fall against the fabric. Rio considered taking it with her, but she was taking enough tonight. Instead, she folded it neatly and placed it on the chair. A lily of the valley bloomed between her fingers and she tucked it into the folds. <em>I'm sorry. Forgive me.</em> Then, with a flick of her fingers, the door creaked open.</p><p>She stepped into the room, quiet as a shadow, her presence a mere whisper in the stillness of the night. Nicholas stirred in his bed, sensing something, his small figure tensing. He blinked in the dim light, his gaze meeting Rio’s.</p><p>“Shh,” Rio whispered, pressing a finger to her lips as she knelt beside him. She wasn’t sure what hurt more—seeing him so close, so full of life, or knowing she was about to take him from the only world he’d ever known. </p><p>Nicholas’s eyes were wide with a mix of confusion. “Mami?” he whispered, still groggy but recognizing her voice. “What’s happening?”</p><p>Rio swallowed, her heart twisting. “I was thinking… maybe you and I could take a little walk together,” she murmured, brushing a lock of hair from his forehead. “Just for a while.”</p><p>Nicholas hesitated, uncertainty clouding his gaze. He glanced over at Agatha, still asleep, her face softened in the peace of slumber. “Won’t she be sad? When she wakes up?” he asked, his voice small, unsure.</p><p>Rio’s heart clenched at the question, but she quickly masked the pain with a soft smile, brushing a stray lock of hair from Nicholas’s forehead. She leaned in, her voice gentle but firm, trying to soothe him as best she could.</p><p>“Of course, she’ll miss you, my love,” Rio murmured, her hand resting briefly on his cheek. “But she’ll be happy knowing you’re spending time with me, and that you’re safe. You know how much she loves you. This is just for a little while, and then we’ll all be together I promise.”</p><p>Nicholas’s brow furrowed, his small hand clutching the blanket tighter as though it might anchor him to the world he knew. Rio didn’t rush him. She allowed him his moment of hesitation and refused to let the sadness in her own chest rise to the surface. She had to be strong for him now. “Together like a family?” He questioned softly.</p><p>“Yeah honey,” Rio continued, her voice steady and comforting. “But first you’re going to be with me, and we’re going to have our own little adventures. Just like you and mommy have. But somewhere new.”</p><p>Nicholas looked at her, his expression still unsure, but the comfort in her words began to ease his worries. He nodded slowly as if he was still learning to trust in the promise of this new journey.</p><p>Rio smiled softly, though her chest tightened with every word she spoke. “You’ll love it, Nicky. We’ll go to places you've never seen. Maybe we'll even find some new flowers for your collection, the rare ones, the ones only I know about.” She paused, letting the idea hang in the air, watching the flicker of curiosity spark in his eyes.</p><p>“And I know you’ve always wanted to see the forest at night,” she added, her voice playful. “The stars are brighter, and the trees, they glow just a little when the moonlight touches them. You’ll see— it’ll be magical. Just like those stories your mama used to tell you. We’ll pass through there. Maybe we can wish on some fireflies! And then you’ll get to see where I live.”</p><p>Rio paused as she tried to build up some excitement in her voice though all she felt was dread. “There’s a huge city I built. And I have a great big dog. So big you can ride on his back as you explore!”</p><p>Nicholas’s expression softened, the lines of confusion beginning to fade as his imagination sparked to life. “That sounds... really cool, Mami. I like dogs. I think. But—“ He hesitated, glancing back at Agatha, then at Rio’s eyes, sensing there was something important that still felt off. “Will we stay there for a long time? Without mommy?”</p><p>Rio’s heart ached at the question, but she swallowed hard, forcing the promise from her lips. “Not forever, sweetheart. Just a little while. Just long enough to see some new things together. And when she’s ready, your mama will come to us. And we’ll be waiting for her. Just like you both have waited for me.”</p><p>The words felt like ash in her mouth, but she pushed them out anyway, doing her best to make them sound real. To make them sound hopeful. She couldn’t let him see the storm raging beneath the calm surface she was trying to maintain. Not now, not when he needed this to feel safe. She didn’t have it in her to take him against his will.</p><p>Nicholas’s eyes brightened again, reassured by her tone, though he still hesitated. “Okay. Just for a little while.” He relaxed slightly, curling against her side, the comforting warmth of her presence enough to calm his worries, for now. “Maybe we’ll find some magic flowers, like you said.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her breath catching for a moment as she kissed the top of his head. His hair smelled like his mother’s. She knew there was no magic flower that could ease the ache in her heart, but she would make sure he had these memories to carry with him. "I’m sure we will, Nicky. I’m sure we will.” </p><p>She held him close for a moment longer, her mind racing with the weight of what was to come, but she forced it down, focusing only on him. When the time came, when he was older, she prayed he would understand— but for now, she would make it as easy as she could. What was death if not the promise of another adventure?</p><p>“Alright, little one,” Rio whispered, standing up carefully with him in her arms. “Let’s go see the stars.”</p><p>“Wait!” Nicky squirmed in her arms, hanging half out of them as he stretched to press a kiss to Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>Rio’s heart tore again, but she couldn’t stop herself from whispering, “Give her one from me too.”</p><p>Nicky did so.</p><p>And Rio carried him away with her into the night.</p><p>It was quiet. Just as she promised, the stars were bright. She knew that her son, despite his curious excitement, would be asleep long before they reached the door to her world.</p><p>He wouldn’t hear his mother’s piercing scream when she reached out to find an empty bed.</p><p>That was for the best.</p><p>She did not even allow herself to hope that Agatha would forgive her. She had kept her promise, she had given them both as much time as she possibly could. But she had broken them all the same.</p><p>Death takes and takes. There was no mercy or relief in it.</p><p>As they stepped through the door, the world grew cold.</p><p>Agatha in her sleep pulled the blankets tighter around herself against the chill. A temporary shroud. It wouldn’t last.</p><p>Nothing would.</p>

<p>Rio wasn’t sure what to expect as she carried Nicky through the door she had carved into her realm.</p><p>Normally she didn’t interact with the souls she collected. Her presence was usually enough, a magnetic force strong enough to draw them in. They <em> passed </em> as the mortals called it, and she didn’t think of them again until they arrived on the train as her workers. A few needed convincing. They floated above their bodies and tried to bargain with her. </p><p>But always she had been able to maintain such a firm presence that they’d soon relented. Death didn’t make exceptions. She’d tried to make one and even that she had failed.</p><p>She took a shuddering breath, and pressed a gentle kiss to the top of her sleeping son’s head, unsure if he would be in her arms when she reached the other side.</p><p>Death stepped through the door, carrying the first soul in history that had come willingly.</p><p>
<em> And in doing so, unbeknownst to mortals or gods, a deep and powerful spell was cast. </em>
</p><hr/><p>Agatha woke slowly, lulled by the softness of the early dawn light filtering through the cabin window. She stretched, reaching out instinctively for the warmth of Nicholas’s small body beside her—but her fingers met only the cool, empty sheets. Frowning, she sat up, glancing around the dim room. “Nicky?” she called softly, expecting to see him somewhere nearby, his mischievous grin peeking out from behind the door or under the bed.</p><p>But there was nothing. Just silence.</p><p>A chill slipped through her as she called his name again, louder this time, her voice echoing in the quiet cabin. “Nicholas!” She threw back the blankets and hurried through each room, her heart pounding with an intensity that bordered on terror as every corner she turned showed no sign of him.</p><p>She flung open the front door, her eyes scanning the forest, expecting, hoping to see him wandering among the trees like he often did, perhaps collecting feathers or bits of bark for his growing collection. But the path was empty, the morning still. Too still.</p><p>Glancing around the porch, her eyes landed on her folded cloak, and the flower pressed against it. And that’s when it hit her as if a hand had clamped down on her heart. She was choking. She was drowning. She was dying.</p><p>
<em> She was screaming. </em>
</p><p>The realization came with a force that nearly knocked her to her knees. Her fingers dug into the doorframe as fury and grief rose within her, blazing like an uncontained fire. She staggered back inside, gripping the edge of the table, her breaths coming in harsh, ragged gasps.</p><p>She had trusted Rio, trusted that she would keep her distance, that she would respect the quiet life they had built here. The cruel irony twisted in her gut. The very woman she loved, the woman she would have given anything for, had come like a thief in the night and taken their son without a word, without even the chance for her to say goodbye. That was the cruelest part.</p><p>She had known, deep in her gut that the fragile peace she’d carried wouldn’t last. She hadn’t expected that part. But never in the worst versions of her nightmares had she imagined she wouldn’t be able to kiss that sweet boy’s cheek one last time.</p><p>A raw, guttural sound escaped her lips as she slammed her fist onto the table. “How could you,” she choked, her voice trembling with rage. “How <em> dare </em> you, Rio.” She shouted and her voice filled the cabin as if the woman could hear her. She hoped she could.</p><p>Images flooded her mind—of Nicholas laughing as he played, the way he’d tuck a flower behind his ear and say he was keeping it safe for his mami. The promise she’d made to him every night, that she’d be there when he woke up, that she’d keep him safe.</p><p>A sob tore from her throat as she dropped to her knees, hands curling against the floor. She wanted to scream, to tear apart the trees and drag Rio back to face her. To demand an explanation, to claw Nicholas from her grip if she had to. But there was nothing, only the empty cabin, the mocking silence, and the hollow ache inside her heart where her son had been.</p><p>Trembling, she pressed her hands to her face, her voice hoarse and broken. “You’ve taken everything from me. You’ve taken him… and I can’t… I can’t…” </p><p>Her anger surged again, hotter and sharper than before. She swore under her breath, the words a promise, a curse. “I’m coming for him. I’ll bring him back, Rio. You may be Death itself, but you will <em> not </em> keep my son from me.”</p><p>Agatha rose, her grief hardening into cold resolve, her steps steady as she grabbed her cloak and stepped out into the dawn. The path before her was uncertain, the consequences unknown. It didn’t matter. She had a singular purpose now, one relentless drive: to find Rio and bring their son home.</p><p>Agatha stormed out of the cabin, her body thrumming with a raw, furious force. The soft light of dawn illuminated the garden, the delicate flowers Rio had left in secret for Nicholas, each bloom a quiet reminder of her love.</p><p>But now they felt like mockery.</p><p>With a snarl, Agatha dropped to her knees and wrenched a handful of lilies from the earth, dirt spilling from their torn roots. She crushed them in her fist, the petals bruising under her grip as her rage became uncontainable. Her hands moved with abandon, tearing through the flowerbeds that she had so carefully tended, shredding each petal and stem. Flowers that had once been symbols of memory and connection were scattered in pieces.</p><p>The garden wilted under her wrath. Each plant bent and curled, withering to gray before her eyes. She ripped out the roses by their roots, the thorns cutting into her palms without a second thought. She let the blood smear and spill. Agatha was no stranger to blood and thorns. Every part of her burned with a violent need to destroy—to unmake what they had built here, this small, fragile life forged under false promises.</p><p>With each plant she tore, the fury within her seemed to grow wild and consuming. It was a rage that defied words and surpassed any pain she’d ever known. Agatha was feral. She could feel her magic surging beneath her skin, responding to the dark, swirling storm inside her. The air around her grew heavy, thick with a palpable energy that sent a shudder through the earth beneath her feet.</p><p>Breathing hard, she stood and turned toward the cabin. Her home. <em> Their </em> home. The sanctuary where she had raised their son, where she had dreamed of safety, of love. The home she had shared with her <em> wife </em>.</p><p>But now, it was nothing more than a shell. It held only memories, promises broken and shattered beyond repair. It was an empty shrine to a life that had never been fully hers.</p><p>Her fingers curled, the energy pulsing through her hands, and she felt a sharp, almost exhilarating release as she flung her hands toward the cabin. The structure ignited instantly, flames licking hungrily at the wood, catching the rafters. The fire roared to life.</p><p>Agatha watched as the flames consumed everything, her chest heaving as her heart pounded in sync with the blaze. This was an ending, a severing of the ties that had bound her to this place.</p><p>No more would she be the woman who had planted flowers in the garden. The mother who hung laundry and told fantastic stories. That woman was dead. That woman had been buried under a mountain of grief the moment Rio had taken Nicholas away.</p><p>There was no softness left in her, no warmth. Only the cold, unyielding fury of a mother’s wrath.</p><p>As the flames climbed higher, reaching toward the sky, she stood rigid, her voice low and trembling with a terrible promise. “You’ve seen wars, Rio,” she murmured, her words swallowed by the inferno before her. “But you’ve never faced me. I’ll bring death to its knees if I have to. I’ll destroy everything for what you’ve done.”</p><p>The fire burned brighter, the cabin crumbling as the blaze devoured it whole. The morning itself seemed to darken as embers and ash swirled around her. And as she watched it fall, her face lit by the flames, she felt something solidify within her—a hardened resolve, a relentless purpose that would not be swayed.</p><p>She <em>would</em> find her son.</p><p>Agatha turned away, the fire blazing behind her, and with each step she took, she left the woman she had once been behind. This was <em>war</em>. She would stop at nothing until she had torn down the very walls of the underworld itself.</p><p>Life had been so gentle with—<em>Agatha could not bear to think his name</em>—with him. And her magic under that peace had slumbered. But now she could feel the familiar prickle under her skin. Love had been an interlude, vengeance was familiar.</p><hr/><p>Rio felt the first tremor ripple through the garden. She stood, her face impassive, as a rosebush suddenly wilted in front of her. Its vibrant blossoms faded to gray, shriveling under an unseen force. One by one, the blooms began to wither, as if crushed by an invisible hand, the leaves curling in on themselves, brittle and lifeless. They turned to ash and blew away.</p><p>It was like watching her heart being torn apart, petal by petal.</p><p>Around her, vines that had once draped gracefully in an arch over the stone bench—the bench they’d shared so many sweet whispers on—retracted and blackened. Their leaves curled and flaked to dust. The shadeblooms, delicate and aglow with ethereal light, dimmed and cracked, the soft petals falling away.</p><p>The entire garden—their sanctuary, their heart’s work, their love made physical—was unraveling before her eyes.</p><p>Rio forced herself to remain still, to keep her face an unreadable mask, but inside, a fissure ran deep, threatening to splinter her. She could feel Agatha’s fury, her raw pain, pulsing through each leaf that shriveled, each petal that was stripped from its stem. </p><p>It was as if Agatha’s grief had found a way to claw into the underworld itself, carving a path to Rio’s heart.</p><p>Each withered bloom was a reminder of what she had done. Of what she had stolen, all for the sake of love—and, perhaps, for her own cowardice.</p><p>The vines twisted in agony, snapping and falling, leaving gaping holes in the canopy. As the last of life crumbled to dust, Rio closed her eyes, letting herself feel every ounce of Agatha’s anger, every unspoken word and howl of betrayal.</p><p>She <em>deserved</em> it. She had known what she would unleash, the damage it would do, but still, she had taken their son.</p><p>With a shaky breath, Rio turned away from the wreckage, her shoulders squared, her jaw set. She knew the destruction would be absolute, that Agatha’s fury would be relentless and unending until she found what had been taken from her.</p><p>Agatha’s wrath would be unforgiving, an unstoppable force against Rio’s immovable resolve.</p><p>And still, Rio held a fragile hope—that, one day, Agatha might come to understand. That, even after all the pain and ruin, she might find a way back to her, a way to heal what they had both broken.</p><p>She retained her composure until one last thing was taken. There was a tight pain on her finger, and she watched as the braided wooden ring splintered. Its wood cracked and twisted as if torn apart by an unseen force. Rio’s breath hitched as she felt the searing pain coil through her chest. She looked down, watching helplessly as the ring—the simple, beautiful piece Agatha had crafted from roots and vines that had once symbolized their unity—splintered into shards, each fragment falling lifelessly to the ground. </p><p>The broken pieces lay in the dust, stark against the gray stone. Her fingers, now bare and aching, closed over the empty space on her hand as if trying to hold onto a part of it that still lingered. But there was nothing left. No remnant of their vow, nothing but the memory of that quiet moment when Agatha had kissed her hand and willed it onto her finger with a trembling smile.</p><p>Rio sank to her knees, her breath ragged as the full weight of the worlds above and below settled on her shoulders. She had always told herself that she could bear it, that she could withstand Agatha’s fury, even her hatred if it meant keeping their son safe. But this—this was agony.</p><p>The sound that tore from her chest was raw and unrestrained, the wail of a soul left in ruins. Her shoulders shook as her composure crumbled, her tears falling like rain over the lifeless garden. She pressed her hand to her chest as if to somehow hold back the tidal wave of grief and regret, but it was too late; the dam had broken.</p><p>Between sobs, she whispered Agatha’s name, over and over, like a prayer. It was a call to a lover she knew would not come, an apology too fractured to reach its destination. She was alone in the echoing silence of the underworld, her cries swallowed by the unyielding shadows.</p><p>She had faced countless battles and endured eons of isolation, but nothing had prepared her for the pain of losing Agatha’s love. This was not the wrath of an enemy she could conquer. This was the desolation of knowing she had been her own undoing.</p><p>She didn’t know how many minutes, hours, or years she spent here grieving her wife, her son, and their lives. Time was strange here. It also didn’t matter. She had been wrong before when she claimed that immortal beings couldn’t carry the same emotion for long.</p><p>Never again would she carry anything else.</p><p>When her tears finally subsided, Rio sat in silence, her head bowed, her fingers tracing the empty space on her hand as if she could somehow will the ring back into existence. She knew she would need to stand, to keep moving. There was always more work to do. But at this moment, she allowed herself to remain where she was, broken and bleeding, her heart as shattered as the garden that had once thrived under their love.</p><p>And with a voice worn raw from grief, she whispered one last time, “Agatha, please forgive me.”</p><hr/><p>The underworld was no longer a place of quiet shadows and solemnity. It was no longer cold and impartial.</p><p>It had transformed, as unrecognizable as the woman who ruled it. Heat seethed through every cavern and corridor, relentless and oppressive, baking the ground into harsh, cracked plains of metal and stone.</p><p>Smoke billowed into the air, turning it thick and suffocating. Rivers of molten metal replaced the cold, gentle streams, and the dark quiet of the underworld had been shattered by the clang of iron and the roar of machinery.</p><p>It blocked out any intrusive thoughts. It kept her mind sharply turned away from any memory of softness. Any memory of them.</p><p>Rio strode through this wasteland, her face set, her jaw clenched against the storm within her. She had ordered her workers to dismantle every hint of natural life, every reminder of what the underworld once was. </p><p>The gardens had been the first to go, ripped out by their roots by Agatha, their memory replaced by the unforgiving walls of iron fortresses by her own hand. The trees that had once adorned her halls were now kindling, their remains fed to the ever-hungry furnaces that blazed and scorched every corner. The air was choked with ash, the ground covered in a thick layer of soot, and even the stones, once etched with the wisdom of ages, had been ground down, reduced to dust and nothingness.</p><p>This was no longer a kingdom of death, but a hellscape, brutal and unyielding. A prison she had built to cage her own heart. It was the only way she knew to protect herself, to suffocate any trace of tenderness, any memory of Agatha and their son, under iron and fire.</p><p>She kept herself busy, moving from one construction site to another, her commands sharp and unyielding. Workers toiled under her relentless gaze, their eyes downcast, their movements efficient and hurried. There was no softness left in her; she had turned into a force as brutal as the world she had forged around her, and they all felt it.</p><p>Yet, no matter how many layers of steel she wrapped around her heart, no matter how many memories she burned, there were moments when the ache resurfaced. She could feel Agatha’s absence like a wound that refused to heal, a pulsing, constant reminder of everything she had lost. An open sore that would never scar.</p><p>One day, while overseeing the construction of another wall of iron, she allowed herself a brief pause. The noise around her faded, and for a moment, the world fell silent. Her gaze drifted over the smog-ridden landscape, the fortress she had built from pain and bitterness, and she felt a flicker of something unfamiliar—a doubt, a faint whisper of regret that slipped through the cracks in her armor.</p><p>Her fingers brushed over the empty space on her hand, where the ring had once been. She clenched her fist, hard enough that her nails bit into her skin. She was queen of this barren, merciless kingdom now, her heart hardened and her mind unyielding. </p><p>Yet, as she turned away from the endless expanse of smoke and iron, a single tear traced down her cheek, hidden and unseen, falling to the ground where it sizzled and disappeared into the scalding earth.</p><hr/><p>Faint footsteps echoed through the iron fortress as a young figure stepped into the hollowed-out halls, his face illuminated only by the flickering glow of molten metal in the distance. The boy’s eyes widened at the surreal world around him, but his gaze held steady, even as the shadows seemed to shift and twist. He could feel that he was being watched from every angle. This place—Death's dominion—was like nothing he’d ever seen, yet he stood resolute.</p><p>The Queen of this place appeared before him, a looming figure draped in dark armor, her eyes fierce, like embers flaring in the depths of an inferno. She observed him in silence, brow arched, bemusement masking the faintest hint of something far more dangerous.</p><p>"No mortal is allowed here," she murmured, her voice reverberating through the cold metal walls. She circled him slowly, inspecting this young interloper as one might a stray mouse who had wandered into a lion’s den. "I have not even granted safe passage to the most worthy of men. What makes you think you can pass through my gates without so much as a word?"</p><p>The boy swallowed hard, his fists clenched at his sides, but he didn’t back down. “I came here to find my brother. I know he’s here…somewhere.”</p><p>A smirk played on her lips as she took another step closer, looming over him. “You, a boy, have come into my realm to reclaim a life? Bold. Arrogant, even.” Her voice softened, dangerous with amusement. "Do you know the price of failure here? Or are you so ready to meet the same fate?"</p><p>For a moment, the boy faltered, but he gritted his teeth, raising his chin. “I don’t care what the price is. If I can bring him home…I'll pay it."</p><p>She let out a soft, mocking chuckle as if his determination was nothing more than a passing breeze to her. “And why should I humor such a request?” She let her fingers dance near him, as if ready to snuff out his life with a mere flick. “Few mortals have had the courage—or stupidity—to come here, and yet you stand, demanding my mercy. Convince me, then. Tell me why I should not simply crush you underfoot and be done with it.”</p><p>He opened his mouth, struggling to find words under the weight of her gaze. Finally, as she lifted her hand to strike he shouted, “Agatha sent me!” </p><p>The name struck her like a blade. She froze the flicker of amusement in her eyes gone, replaced by something raw and jagged. The faintest tremor of disbelief crossed her face before she forced it into stone once more.</p><p>“Agatha,” she repeated slowly as if testing the word on her tongue, her voice now an unreadable murmur. “You carry her name as if it were a shield, boy. Do you even know what that name means?”</p><p>The boy’s breath was unsteady, but he stood his ground. “I know that she’s known you for a <em>long</em> time. I know that she doesn’t give up. And I know she wanted to help me find Tommy, even if it meant I had to face you. She believed I could do it.”</p><p>Her expression darkened, though something sorrowful flickered in her eyes, a memory of Agatha’s defiance and warmth that lingered in her soul like a scar. Of course, she'd sent him. But her hesitation was brief. Her face hardened once more as she leaned down, her voice cold. “Then prove your worth, if you think you’re brave enough to bear <em>her</em> will.” She straightened, the faintest smile curling her lips. “Let’s see how far you’ll go for this brother of yours. I hope my <em>lovely</em> wife prepared you well, boy.”</p>

<p>The boy swallowed hard, meeting her gaze. “I followed the Witches’ Road,” he said. His voice was soft, almost reverent. “The path that only <em> she </em> knows, the one that leads you to what you want most.”</p><p>Rio’s brow arched, a mix of curiosity and disbelief crossing her features. She crossed her arms, studying him with newfound intrigue. “And what did she tell you was at the end of that road?”</p><p>His eyes softened, and for a moment, his gaze drifted as if he were remembering a far gentler memory. “I asked her once, what she’d found when she walked it,” he replied. “She said ‘Be careful what you seek Billy, at the end I found my greatest love and my biggest heartbreak.’” His voice trembled slightly, a glimmer of sadness in his gaze. “She told me she hoped I’d have better luck.”</p><p>The words hit Rio like a blow, knocking the breath from her lungs. Her face went still, her usual mask of iron slipping. Silence settled over them, thick as the iron walls that encased her domain. Rio’s gaze fell to the ground, and when she spoke, her voice was barely a whisper, laced with an ache she couldn’t contain.</p><p>“It’s a trick boy,” she murmured. “It doesn’t lead to what you want most, only what you’re willing to lose for it.”</p><p>Billy frowned, his young face furrowing with confusion. “She said you were waiting there,” he insisted, voice small. “She said that road brought her to you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes sharpened, the faintest glimmer of anger twisting beneath her sorrow. “And what makes you think that road will lead you to your brother?” she demanded, her voice cutting.</p><p>“Because Agatha believed it would,” he replied fiercely, his voice suddenly full of the same unyielding certainty that had once blazed in Agatha herself. “She told me that if I sang as I went, the magic would lead the way.”</p><p>Rio looked at him, the stubborn tilt of his chin, the fierce gleam in his eyes, so much like Agatha’s. He wasn’t their son but she could see her influence all over him. She felt a pang in her chest and wondered how much time Agatha had spent with him. How much she had shared. <em> No </em>, she wouldn’t be jealous of a child.</p><p>Her lips curved into a bitter smile. “And so you came,” she said softly, “to sing me a little song, did you? She didn’t send you here to <em>help</em> <em>you</em> out, she sent you as a message to me. You don’t know her like I do.”</p><p>Billy held his ground, meeting Rio’s mocking gaze with a resolve that surprised even her. “Maybe I don’t,” he said carefully, voice steady. “But I know she wouldn’t just send me to my death—not without a way out.”</p><p>Rio scoffed, crossing her arms. “You wouldn’t be the first Agatha sent to their death without blinking. Didn’t she tell you? Sending me a few souls used to be her way of getting my attention. You think that your way out is a <em> magic song </em>?” Her voice was laced with skepticism, but there was a flicker of curiosity in her eyes.</p><p>He hesitated, gripping the strap of his worn pack as if it were a lifeline. “Agatha saw something in me. She said I had the touch of a muse,” he replied, his voice uncertain but brave. “She said that sometimes… sometimes words can reach where nothing else can.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze darkened. The boy might have been naïve, but he was far from foolish, and Agatha had known that. The thought stung—a sharp, bitter pang in her chest. Agatha had chosen him, of all people, to stand in this place and challenge her. She wasn’t certain if she felt anger, betrayal, or a twisted sense of pride that Agatha would still defy her from afar. Why hadn’t she come here herself if she knew the way?</p><p>“Muses are fickle,” Rio murmured, her voice low and dangerous. “But you’re right, boy. Their words can bend fate, pluck the strings of destiny. My dear wife always had a knack for finding loopholes.”</p><p>She took a step forward, her eyes gleaming with something that lay between cruelty and grudging respect. “If you truly are a muse,” she said, her tone cold as the iron walls around them, “then sing, boy. Show me this gift she claims you have. Let me see if you have even a fraction of her power.”</p><p>Billy swallowed, clearly unsure. His fingers trembled slightly as he clenched them at his sides, but he didn’t back down. Slowly, he opened his mouth, and a soft, tentative melody began to fill the space between them.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> "Cloaked by the river Lethe’s veil, </em>
</p><p>
<em> A child torn by two who refuse to yield. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Forever searching Elysian fields </em>
</p><p>
<em> Death she takes, and Nature she heals</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Down by the river, </em>
</p><p>
<em> he bends to play.</em>
</p><p>
<em> Caught in between </em>
</p><p>
<em> night and day.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Love carried him in </em>
</p><p>
<em> It carried him out.</em>
</p><p>
<em> Hearts once together </em>
</p><p>
<em> Bleeding with doubt.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Flowers they bloom, </em>
</p><p>
<em> Then they rot. </em>
</p><p>
<em> A love so pure </em>
</p><p>
<em> Cannot be forgot.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> One day in the fields, </em>
</p><p>
<em> Three will stand. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Walking together, </em>
</p><p>
<em> Hand in hand." </em>
</p><p> </p><p>His voice was untrained, raw, but there was an aching purity to it, a truth that rang out in each note. The song was one of longing, of a bond unbroken by death or distance. His words echoed the pain of separation, the desperate hope of reunion. </p><p>It was Agatha’s pain, Agatha’s love, carried on his voice like a whisper of memory, and Rio felt it slip past her defenses, winding its way through the bitterness she clung to like armor.</p><p>Her fists clenched as she watched him, her expression stony, but inside, her heart was torn anew. This boy—this mortal child—had somehow bridged the impossible, brought her face-to-face with the raw truth she had been trying to bury.</p><p>As Billy’s voice faded, Rio’s gaze lingered on him, cold but calculating. “So,” she murmured, her voice a brittle edge. “You think you’re her messenger, do you? That you can soften me with a song?”</p><p>Billy took a shaky breath. “I don’t know if I can,” he admitted, his voice barely a whisper. “But I’ll keep singing if it gets me closer to my brother. I’ll keep singing until I find him.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, but a flicker of something softer crossed her gaze. She almost admired his bravery—almost. “If you think your voice alone will carry you through the Underworld, you’re even more foolish than I thought.”</p><p>“Maybe,” he said, his chin tilting up in defiance. “But it’s all I’ve got. And Agatha believed in it. She believed in me.”</p><p>Rio looked at him for a long, hard moment. “Get out.” She said icily.</p><p>Billy blinked, taken aback. “What?” he stammered, his voice cracking.</p><p>“Leave.” Rio’s voice was steel, each word as cutting as the edge of a blade. “Turn around and walk out the way you came. Leave now, and perhaps I’ll let you live.”</p><p>The fire in his eyes dimmed, uncertainty shadowing his face. But after a heartbeat, he shook his head. “No,” he said, his voice small but firm. “I won’t leave without my brother.”</p><p>Rio’s lip curled, a faint sneer twisting her expression. “Do you know how many have made demands of me, boy? Mortals, gods, spirits—none of them dared refuse me when I granted them a second chance.” She took a slow, predatory step toward him, her shadow stretching out across the ground like the jaws of a trap.</p><p>“But Agatha—” he began, and Rio’s hand shot out, fingers tight around his jaw, cutting him off. He winced but didn’t pull back.</p><p>“Don’t,” she repeated, her voice low and venomous. “Do not bring that name back down here.” Her grip tightened, and Billy felt a chill seep into his skin like ice spreading through his veins.</p><p>Billy met her gaze, refusing to flinch. “She wondered,” he said, his voice steady despite the cold biting into him, “if you still cared.”</p><p>For a moment, something in Rio’s face softened, a crack in her armor that almost allowed the sorrow beneath to show. But it was gone in an instant, replaced by cold fury.</p><p>“Care?” Her laugh was bitter, a hollow sound that echoed through the desolate landscape around them. “If I cared, I would’ve spared you the agony of even stepping foot in this place.”</p><p>She released him, and Billy staggered back, clutching his jaw where the cold had burned him. “Then kill me,” he said, lifting his chin. “If you don’t care, if you really hate her, then go ahead and do it.”</p><p>The silence that fell between them was thick. Rio’s gaze bore into him, a mix of contempt and something else, something raw and unreadable. “You’re no more than a pawn in her game,” she hissed, but the words lacked their usual bite.</p><p>“Then I’ll play,” Billy shot back, his voice rising in desperation. “If it means getting to my brother, I’ll play any role you need me to.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed, her expression unreadable. “I see why she took you as her little pet. You’re just like her ” she said, almost to herself. “Stubborn to a fault. Reckless.”</p><p>She straightened, looking past him into the shadows of her domain, the vast, cold expanse that stretched into eternity. “Very well, boy,” she murmured. “If you’re so eager to play the hero, I’ll allow it. But don’t think you’ll find me so easily swayed.” </p><p>Her voice turned sharp, commanding. “If you manage to find what’s been lost, I’ll be waiting. Then we’ll discuss what it costs.”</p><p>Billy swallowed, nodding, his determination undimmed. He took a step forward, his jaw set. </p><p>But Rio lifted a hand, her expression dark and calculating. “Before you begin, remember this,” she warned. “If you falter, if you stumble, even for a moment—Agatha’s name will not save you.”</p><p>With that, she turned, the shadows parting before her as she strode away, leaving Billy to face the unknown path alone.</p><p>The boy’s song lingered in her mind, each line like a small dagger pressing against a part of her she'd tried to lock away. The song echoed as the prophecy whispered long ago by the Fates themselves had. Yet, it twisted in ways she hadn’t expected. It was as if the words themselves were bending, shaping to fit something new. </p><p>She tried to push it away, but the echoes persisted, drawing threads between her own memories and the young boy’s song, binding her to a story she’d thought was closed.</p><p>
<em> "Cloaked by the river Lethe’s veil,   </em>
</p><p>
<em> A child torn by two who refuse to yield…” </em>
</p><p>Her son, the one who had vanished from her arms the instant she’d crossed into her realm as if the dark itself had swallowed him whole. She had tried, searched endlessly, and even invoked the river's keepers, but they gave her nothing but silence. </p><p>The Lethe’s magic hid her child from her grasp, as if he were both here and nowhere, kept between life and death, day and night. She had raged against it, thinking that perhaps it was Nature’s way of reclaiming what she, Death, had tried to claim for herself.</p><p>
<em> "Forever searching Elysian fields…” </em>
</p><p>Rio’s fists clenched. The Elysian Fields, that elusive paradise reserved for the purest mortals, a place she herself could never tread. If her son was somehow there, she would have to find another way—someone with enough love and magic to guide him back. Someone whose steps could walk where hers could not. Agatha had sent this boy, this unlikely messenger, instead of coming here herself. But why?</p><p>
<em> “Death she takes, and Nature she heals…” </em>
</p><p>She bit back the twist of bitterness at the thought. It had always been this way between them—a constant push and pull. But nature could not heal what had been taken. The wound left by her son’s absence was as raw as the day she’d crossed the river with him and felt him slip from her grasp. She was certain her wife would say the same. Some wounds couldn’t heal from nature or time.</p><p>Billy’s song continued to ring in her mind, its simple melody tugging at a deeper truth, a thread from the Fates’ prophecy that she’d long dismissed: <em> “One day in the fields, three will stand. Walking together, hand in hand.” </em></p><p>The image it conjured was almost too painful to bear—a world where she, Agatha, and their son might stand together. Somehow overcoming the barriers of life and death, of separation and loss. Breaking the cycle.</p><p>Was such a reunion even possible? Or was it just a child’s dream, twisted into song, sent to mock her?</p><p>She closed her eyes, considering the old prophecy from every angle, every implication. Had Agatha believed in it? Had she believed it enough to send this boy to challenge her, to remind her that the story might not yet be over? She almost laughed at the thought—a foolish hope that perhaps the Fates themselves could be defied.</p><p>As she turned away from the empty darkness, she felt a shiver of something unfamiliar ripple through her—a fragile sliver of hope, buried beneath layers of grief and anger. If she could somehow uncover the truth, if she could follow the thread of this prophecy to its end, perhaps a different story could be told. </p>

<p>
<span>In the days that followed, Billy wandered through Rio’s domain, his determination unwavering as he searched for his brother’s spirit. When he finally found him—a pale shadow of the boy he once knew, hovering on the edge of memory—Billy felt his own heart lighten. Tommy was </span>
<em>
<span>there</span>
</em>
<span>, somehow still waiting for him. Call it a restless spirit, unfinished business, love persevering. Together, they made their way back to the heart of the underworld, to the waiting figure of Death herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Billy approached Rio, he held his brother’s hand tightly, fear flickering in his eyes, though his voice was steady. “We found each other,” he said. “Now... will you let us go? Can I trust you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, Rio’s expression was unreadable, her gaze lingering on the brothers with a resigned distance. If she couldn’t hold onto what she wanted, perhaps she could at least grant them a chance at freedom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But she wasn’t ready to let them leave without a test, one last question to be answered for herself—could mortals truly change? Could anyone? </span>
<em>
<span>Could she? </span>
</em>
<span>Could someone ever let go of doubt entirely and place their trust in another, as she had once tried and failed to do?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded slowly, issuing her final terms. “You will both leave, but in a single file. One follows, one leads. You cannot look back, not for anything. If you truly want to leave together, you’ll have to trust one another. Not a step out of place. Do you understand?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy hesitated, gripping his brother’s hand even tighter, but his gaze remained steady. “We understand,” he said. And as he turned to lead Tommy out of the underworld, he glanced back one last time at Rio, an almost pitying look in his young eyes. “I hope... I hope you’ll find what you’ve lost, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched them go, her jaw tight as they faded from her sight, swallowed by the shadows of her realm. She didn’t know if they’d make it. But she allowed herself to hope they would.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As silence settled around her once more, a strange hollowness filled her, as if something she’d barely dared to hold had slipped through her fingers. She turned away, her thoughts drifting back to the garden she’d long left abandoned. It had been nothing more than ashes, stones, and barren soil since Agatha’s wrath had torn it apart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But as she approached, she saw two small blooms pushing up through the cracks—two slender flowers, delicate yet resilient, rising from the earth. A tribute to the kindness she had shown the brothers. She felt a pull, something soft and strange, stirring within her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rolling up her sleeves, Rio knelt by the twin flowers. Slowly, deliberately, she dug her fingers into the soil, feeling its weight and warmth, feeling the pulse of the earth as she planted a new seed alongside them, her hands working without magic, without command.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stayed there, kneeling in the dirt, letting the weight of the moment sink in, breathing in the faint, earthy scent of new life. The first seed of something that might yet grow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky,” she called out softly, unknowing if he could hear her words. “We’re going to plant a garden for your mama. We’re going to make it something so beautiful. You and me. And when she’s ready… we’re going to share it with her. Just like I said. When she’s ready, she’ll come home.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Agatha stirred as the morning light broke over the hills. But something else had caught her eye—a glimmer of deep, indigo nestled in the grass beside her. She blinked, her heart giving a sudden, startled leap. A single shadebloom had grown where she had slept, its petals as vivid and haunting as a memory come to life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart thudded as she stared at it, her anger momentarily forgotten. She hadn’t seen a shadebloom since…since before everything had fallen apart. Since they’d been happy, back in the days when their world was full of gardens and life and dreams for the future. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached out slowly, almost afraid it would vanish if she dared to touch it. But it didn’t fade—it remained, stubborn and alive, as if it had waited for her all this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It struck her then, clear as day—this was Rio’s doing. It had to be. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Somehow, after everything that had happened, Rio was reaching out to her, a quiet gesture in a language only they understood. Agatha’s heart tightened painfully, the weight of her anger and grief shifting, giving way to something else—a longing she’d tried so hard to bury.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Had Billy reached her, then? Had he softened Rio’s heart even a little? She closed her eyes. She was so tired. She was so tired of the rage that had burned through her, so tired of punishing herself and Rio, holding them both captive in a loss that seemed endless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And as she sat there, with the flower warm in her hand, she saw it clearly—she had lost her son, yes, but she didn’t have to lose her wife, too. Blaming Rio for their son’s absence, for something she herself couldn’t understand or control, wasn’t fair. It never had been.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thoughts drifted to Nicky, his words echoing in her mind as if he were there beside her, the gentleness with which he’d picked the flower Rio had left for him and announced, </span>
<em>
<span>“I’ll keep it safe. So she knows I love her back.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed hard, tears prickling her eyes. Maybe…maybe this shadebloom was Rio’s way of saying the same thing—that even after everything, she still loved her, still remembered what they had shared. Gently, Agatha lifted the bloom and tucked it behind her ear, feeling the cool petals brush her skin. The weight of her fury and sorrow began to lift, like a stone she could finally set down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped through the misted woods, her heart racing with each hurried stride. She had no sense of how long she’d been walking, only that she was drawn forward by an undeniable pull.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And in an instant, she realized where that pull was coming from.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was there, coming toward her from the other side stepping through a crack in a tree, her eyes wide and worn, her steps just as frantic. They both slowed as they closed the last of the distance, taking each other in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught—Rio looked like she’d been through a war of her own, her hair tangled, her cheeks hollow, the weight of sleepless nights and relentless sorrow etched into every line of her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She knew she probably looked just as broken, just as undone. They stood there, eyes meeting across the small threshold, feeling the fullness of the absence that had eaten at them both.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held out her arms, her face softening, her heart aching with a forgiveness she hadn’t been sure she would ever feel again. Without a word, Rio collapsed into her, and Agatha pulled her close, wrapping her arms tightly around her, feeling Rio’s shuddering breath, the press of her heartbeat against her own. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They clung to each other, each finding strength in the other’s presence, a silent understanding passing between them that needed no words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Agatha whispered, her voice breaking. “I hated you for so long, and I know it wasn’t fair. I know you were just as hurt…that you made the choice you thought you had to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand tightened on her back, her voice a hoarse murmur against Agatha’s shoulder. “I’m sorry too. I shouldn’t have decided alone. I shouldn’t have taken him without giving you a chance to say goodbye. I thought I was protecting you…but I was wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They pulled back, faces inches apart, each seeing the tears in the other’s eyes, the cracks in the armor they had built over so much pain. In that moment, there were no more walls, no more blame or hurt—only the fierce, unrelenting love that they had always shared</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cupped Rio’s face, her fingers brushing against her cheek, and without another thought, she kissed her, pouring every bit of longing, every apology, every word she had never spoken into that single, searing kiss. Rio melted into her, returning the kiss with equal fervor as if nothing else mattered but this—this moment, this reunion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing else did matter, to either of them, except the fragile hope of starting again. They lost themselves in each other, in the fierce, undeniable love that had never truly died. It never would. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally broke apart, breathless and holding on tight, they stayed close, foreheads touching. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s go find our son,” Rio whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha winced “Don’t, my love, don’t give me false hope now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not false. That boy you sent. The song he carried. I think it was a guide… I think I know where our boy is.”</span>

<p>
<span>Rio led her down a path that they had not walked before. As they moved through the dark here, along the outskirts of her city, Agatha noted the jagged metal towers, the smoke clouding the air, and the new oppressive heat that blanketed the landscape. “You’ve been busy down here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “A distraction. When I arrived back here… with Nicky, I passed the threshold and he had slipped through my arms. I couldn’t find him. I couldn’t </span>
<em>
<span>feel</span>
</em>
<span> him here. And I couldn’t bear it. So I went to work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My love,” Agatha gasped softly, reaching to take her hand, “all this time… I was so angry that you took him, without me getting to say goodbye, but I found the tiniest shred of comfort that at least he’d be near you.” She hesitated before adding in a small whisper, “You didn’t get to have him either.” The realization that they had both suffered the same agony broke her heart all over again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did not.” She kept hold of Agatha’s hand, a tether and an anchor as they walked. “Tell me about the boy. The one you sent here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, she was a clever witch but she had impressed even herself with that particular scheme. “He found me. He told me he’d had a vision about his missing brother, Toby or whoever. I didn’t pay attention but then he said that he knew he was in the underworld. And that some other meddling god had let slip to him that I was the only living person who had passed between the earth and your kingdom. So he willed his magic into a song that led him to find me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you believe that? That he </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> some oracle or muse?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Beats me.” Agatha shrugged. “But he was young. Sweet and eager. So earnest… malleable. I thought that there may be a way to use him. I planted a seed of inspiration. I encouraged him to write a song about reunion and love. I convinced him that perhaps it would be enough to carry him to Death and thaw her heart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A wave of understanding hit Rio and she grinned at Agatha’s cleverness. “So you puppeted the strings and led him to me to deliver a prophecy,” she breathed, her voice full of pride and wonder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha beamed at her. “I did. And as you once told me, a prophecy spun by fate or muse will always come to pass in some way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was pulled into a deep and passionate kiss. Rio pulled away, smiling brightly for the first time since the night their world had been torn asunder. “You clever, conniving witch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guilty.” Agatha chuckled before growing serious, “There is no power I would not claim, no path I would not walk, no opportunity I would not exploit to find a way back to you and our son,” she confessed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled proudly and squeezed her hand, “Well, all that’s left is to see if it holds any truth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They came to the banks of a massive river. But it did not rush or churn. It was eerily placid and still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is the river Lethe. It… is tricky. To pass through it is to challenge yourself, it tries to wash memory away. But on the other side, is the path to Elysium. And if your pet is right, that’s where our son plays.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, already stepping forward. “Okay, let’s go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait.” Rio pulled her into another tender kiss. “You go first. I will wait here and do my best to guide you across. Wait for me on the other side.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay.” She smiled at her wife, raising her hand to her lips and kissing her knuckles. “See you in a moment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped down into the Lethe, and the chill was immediate, curling around her ankles like icy fingers, tugging her down. The water felt thick, more like mist than liquid, and as she waded deeper, a strange heaviness crept into her limbs, slowing her steps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The river’s magic seeped into her, gentle at first—a soft, quiet nudge that lulled her racing thoughts into silence. She took another step, and a flicker of memory slipped away like smoke, vanishing before she could grasp it. Her fingers twitched as she tried to hold onto something, anything—</span>
<em>
<span>why am I here?</span>
</em>
<span>—but the answer melted into the river as soon as it formed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another step and her own name began to unravel, fading like an echo swallowed by the hungry river mouth. She knew there had been a purpose in coming here, but it slipped away from her too, swallowed by the river’s relentless flow. Her mind drifted, hazy and unfocused as if she were caught in a dream, and for a moment, she simply stood in the middle, lost.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned, searching for something she couldn’t name, and her eyes met those of a woman on the river bank. She felt a strange tugging in her chest—a soft, wordless ache—but she didn’t recognize the beautiful ethereal woman standing at the river’s edge. Yet, despite the unfamiliarity, she felt drawn to her, bound by a thread she couldn’t remember weaving. Her heart beat painfully, insistently, and she felt something </span>
<em>
<span>important</span>
</em>
<span>—something she’d once known—shifting beneath the weight of the water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked at the woman on the river bank, and though she didn’t know who this person was, she </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> her, with a certainty that made her heart throb. Something about her seemed warm, familiar, precious. “I… know you,” Agatha murmured, her voice barely a whisper above the river’s pull. She lifted a hand toward her, almost like a question, and for a fleeting moment, she wanted to turn back, to leave the river and stay by this stranger’s side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio, her eyes shining with determination and sorrow, nodded to her. “Keep going, Agatha. Just a little further,” she urged, her voice steady, cutting through the fog clouding Agatha’s mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hearing that name—</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>—felt like someone had struck a match in the darkness. Agatha clung to it, letting it echo within her as she took another trembling step, the chill of the river deepening, clouding her mind with every inch. She staggered forward, her body aching with the effort, her thoughts drifting in fragments. </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha… Agatha…</span>
</em>
<span> She repeated the name to herself, holding onto it like an anchor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, her foot found solid ground, and as she stumbled forward, her mind began to clear. The fog lifted, and memories came rushing back all at once—her name, her purpose, the feel of her son’s small hands in hers, and most of all, the love that had driven her here. She turned, breath catching in her throat, and her eyes met Rio’s once more, fully seeing her, fully remembering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised her hand in a little salute and Agatha’s brow furrowed as she beckoned her to cross. “Just a little further my love, your turn,” Agatha called.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the river’s edge, Rio paused, her expression shadowed as she responded. “This is as far as I can go,” Rio murmured, the weight of countless centuries in her voice. “You can reach Elysium without me. My duties, the souls… I am bound to them, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, standing on the other side of Lethe’s shimmering, silver-tinged water, her memories of Rio and their son vivid and warm within her heart, looked back at her wife with fierce determination. “They need you, yes. But not as much as </span>
<em>
<span>we</span>
</em>
<span> need you,” she said, voice quiet yet strong. “You’ve guided the dead and ruled the Underworld with care, but now it’s time to come with me. Our family… we need you more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, the tension in her shoulders betraying her conflict. She had been the keeper of the passage of death for so long, taking up a thankless mantle when no one else would. Yet here was Agatha, asking her to give it all up for a single chance at happiness—a chance Rio had long told herself was never meant for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please,” Agatha whispered, hand outstretched toward her. “You’re my family. Don’t let us slip away for a duty you don’t have to bear alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She would not be fool enough to make the same mistake twice. Not after just finding her love again. Rio’s gaze softened, and she waded into the waters with a final, resigned breath. The chill coiled around her as she crossed, each step a quiet battle to hold onto her love for Agatha and Nicky. The further she went, the more she felt pieces of herself begin to drift, the centuries of her rule losing their hold on her heart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She let them go willingly, allowing the river to wash over her sense of duty and resolve. Her reasons, her purpose, the iron walls she’d built around her heart—they faded into the water’s pull.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she reached the other side, she looked at Agatha, not as the queen of the Underworld, but as a woman whose heart beat only for the family that had been waiting for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand was warm as she took Rio’s, grounding her as she emerged from the Lethe’s grasp. The quiet weight that had been so constant for centuries now felt like a distant memory, blurred and fading.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped closer, her thumb brushing softly over Rio’s knuckles, and her voice broke with quiet pride. “I know what you’re giving up for us,” she whispered, her gaze steady, her eyes full of unspoken love and gratitude. “You’ve carried so much, all on your own, and I’ve never known anyone stronger. I’m… so proud of you. And I love you. More than you could ever know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt a warmth spread through her chest, melting the last remnants of the icy resignation that had been her armor. She wanted to correct her, to tell Agatha that she hadn’t lost anything, that nothing could be more precious than what she stood to gain. But she could only pull Agatha close, pressing her forehead against hers, the words coming out as a whisper, raw and true.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You and Nicky—you’re everything to me. </span>
<em>
<span>Nothing</span>
</em>
<span> matters more than that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held her tightly, her arms wrapping around her as if anchoring them both. For a long time, they stayed in each other’s arms, sharing the silence that spoke louder than words. Their breaths mingled, their hearts pounding in sync as the river's distant murmurs faded away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally broke apart, Agatha took Rio’s hand, her expression softened yet resolute. “Come on. We’ve made it this far. Let’s go find our son.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hand in hand, they left the river behind, moving toward Elysium’s mist-shrouded hills with hearts whole once more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stepped onto soft, dew-laden grass, greeted by the vast expanse of Elysium’s endless, rolling fields. The gloom faded and sunlight warmed their skin as they looked out across the landscape, where golden wildflowers danced in the gentle breeze. The fields stretched endlessly, vibrant and rich with life, each hill blending into the next under a radiant sky. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The couple exchanged a glance, their fingers laced tightly together as they took in the beauty around them. It reminded them both, achingly so, of the garden of their courtship, when the weight of everything hadn’t yet settled on their shoulders. There was that same sense of possibility, of something precious unfolding, only now it felt more tangible, more earned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walked through the fields in quiet wonder, each step brushing against blossoms that shimmered as if dusted with stardust. And then, a voice, clear and bright, called out across the fields:</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mami! Mommy!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They froze, their eyes widening as they turned toward the sound. There, standing on a rise in the golden light, was their son. Whole, healthy, and glowing with life, he stood with his arms outstretched, his face lit up with a radiant, unburdened joy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand flew to her mouth, a sob breaking free as she watched him take off at a run, his feet light as air as he bounded toward them, his laughter filling the air like music. Rio felt her own breath catch, her heart swelling as their son barreled forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he reached them, he threw his arms around them both, squeezing tight, as if he’d been waiting a lifetime to do so. They knelt next to him and wrapped their arms around him, holding him close, each overcome by the warmth, the life, the pure love that pulsed between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mommy,” he murmured into Agatha’s shoulder, “Mami told me you’d come.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stroked his hair, her heart brimming with relief as she whispered, “We’re here now, my love. We’re here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And as they held him, standing together in the golden fields of Elysium, everything else fell away. In that moment, there was no past, no pain, no shadows—only the light of their family, whole and unbreakable, reunited at last.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>The quiet hush of Rio’s domain greeted them as they crossed back into her realm, but it was nothing like the place they had left behind. Gone was the shadowed, forbidding expanse ruled by order and control. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, nature had crept over everything, weaving itself into the stonework, transforming the dark corners into a peaceful sanctuary. Buildings once stark and foreboding were softened by vines heavy with blossoms, vibrant and alive, as though they’d been waiting for this very moment to unfurl. The air was warm and filled with the gentle hum of life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Spirits drifted here and there, no longer bound to toil and labor but free to roam, settling in quiet places to rest. Rio had released her hold over them, and now they moved with a tranquil purpose, their presence lending the realm a serene beauty. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was no longer a kingdom of the dead; it was a place of peaceful transition, of memory and release. Rio’s rule had changed, softened by love and loss, and the underworld had blossomed in kind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they walked through the transformed realm, Nicky’s eyes were wide with wonder. When he stepped into their garden—a place once beautiful then broken—it burst into vibrant color around him. Flowers bloomed at his feet, bright blues and purples and whites, an explosion of life that covered the garden floor. The air felt lighter, softer, as though all the burdens they had once carried had been gently laid to rest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the heart of the garden stood the willow tree, its branches trailing down like gentle arms embracing the earth. Agatha felt a pang of nostalgia as they approached, memories of long nights spent beneath its boughs washing over her. It was where she and Rio had fallen in love, had spoken in quiet gentle voices of things dancing around things that they were both too afraid to say aloud. Words that now came to them freely. And now, here they were again, with their son in tow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The three of them sat together in the cool shade, feeling the weight of their journey melt away. Rio reached to her belt, where her dagger hung, polished and gleaming. She held it out to Nicky, who looked up at her with wide, questioning eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Take it," Rio said softly. "This place—this life we share—it belongs to all of us now."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky took the dagger reverently, his fingers wrapping around its hilt as he leaned forward, pressing the blade’s tip to the smooth bark of the willow. With careful strokes, he began to carve their initials into the tree. As each letter took form, the tree seemed to respond, its leaves glowing a little brighter, its branches swaying as if in acknowledgment of their bond.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he finished, Nicky leaned back, his face beaming with pride. The three of them looked up at the tree, at the simple carving that would remain as a testament to the love they had fought so hard to preserve.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned her head on Rio’s shoulder, and Nicky crawled into her lap. They sat there together enveloped by the peace of their garden. The willow’s branches swayed gently above them, and for the first time in many lifetimes, they were at peace, together, under the shade of a love that had endured everything. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In that moment, there was no kingdom, no duty, only family, beneath the willow tree, forever marked with their names.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They lived there happily, never to be separated again.</span>
