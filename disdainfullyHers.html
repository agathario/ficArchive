    <h2>
     Chapter 1
    </h2>
   </div>
   <!--chapter content-->
   <div>
    <p>
     <span>
      Being an unemployed single mother of a teenager had its perks, but it also had its downsides. She could do whatever she wanted when Nicky was at school but surprisingly no one wanted to be around the bossy daughter of a former millionaire. She had despised her mother, but when she died she somehow still received the fortune her mother had retained, perhaps simply because she was the only living relative left at the time. Either way, this meant she had a lot of free time.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      One thing Agatha could never do was sit idly by and watch the world pass. She could have gotten a job of course, but she wanted to be able to spend as much time with Nicky as she could, determined to be nothing like her mostly absent mother had been. That being said, this led to her campaigning for the PTA president. She may or may not have threatened to blackmail the woman running against her until she dropped out, giving Agatha the position by default, but that was besides the point.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She took her position seriously, putting on the best fundraisers for the school, advertising upcoming school events, and dealing with Principal Vidal which felt like a job in and of itself. She did all this for the sake of Nicky. If he asked for a better baseball field, she’d find a way to get funding for it. If he wanted the school band to be involved in more events, she made it happen.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her current endeavor was surviving a bake sale to raise money for a senior field trip. She could plan events like no one’s business but dealing with the other parents of the PTA? That took a lot of patience.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Where should I put my gluten free bundt cake?” her least favorite parent spoke up, breaking her from her thoughts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Preferably in the trash,” Agatha replied, eying the baked good Jennifer was holding.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jennifer huffed and walked away to her wife, Alice, and placed the cake on an empty table. Alice, she could get along with if the interaction called for it, but Jennifer? Absolutely not. The know-it-all that always piped up with the most inane ideas at meetings grated her nerves. She didn’t know how Alice put up with it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha turned back to her own table, laden with a variety of baked goods she had made. People may think she’s lazy but she did use her time wisely. She could just as well have bought the treats instead of baking like Jennifer should have done.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ms. Harkness, what do you think you’re doing?” a familiar voice called out. She pinched the bridge of her nose and turned to find Vidal marching up to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m holding a bake sale, dear,” she replied, her voice sickly sweet.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “With whose permission? I don’t recall signing off on this event,” the principal seethed, her hand gripping her walkie-talkie hard enough her knuckles turned white. She could stand to go to a few yoga classes and calm the fuck down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission,” Agatha shrugged. “Plus, the money will be going to help fund the senior trip, allowing those who can’t afford two nights in a hotel a chance they wouldn’t have had otherwise. I don’t see a problem with that. Unless of course you want to shut it down and be the one to blame. Have fun explaining that to the senior class.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Vidal glared at her and pointed the radio directly at Agatha. “You can stay, but you better have this wrapped up by 5 PM. And don’t pull this shit with me again.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Language, dear. We don’t want the principal setting a bad example for the students now do we?” the older woman asked, unable to keep herself from having the upper hand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The principal continued to glare but did not respond, instead turning on her heel and marching off. Another battle won.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha had a history of trouble with Vidal. The stubborn woman never wanted to approve anything she asked for, finding some flaw or another with the proposals, so Agatha decided to simply forgo the pain of asking her. It surely saved her a lot of stress. Plus, getting a meeting with the principal to discuss said proposals was like getting Nicky to stay off his phone for 5 minutes– practically impossible.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Oh well. She was already over the estimation of her profit with the bake sale so the seniors would all be getting the chance to go. She couldn’t understand why Vidal had to act like she had a stick up her ass about simply not asking permission, but she had given up on understanding anything the woman did in Nicky's freshman year– and he was a senior.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Besides the Vidal scuffle, the bake sale went off without a hitch. Soon enough Agatha was back home, sitting at the dinner table with Nicky.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Did we make enough, Ma?” Nicky asked. He elected to stay home instead of going to the sale with her so he could catch up on homework, but she was no fool. He was really using the time to play video games.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We did,” she hummed. “Your friend Teen–”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s Billy.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Whatever, will be able to go on the trip with you,” she replied, knowing Nicky’s best friend had desperately wanted to go but simply didn’t have the funds required. His parents both died in a car accident 3 years ago and he was now staying with his grandmother who wasn’t prepared for raising a teen boy and only made a living by selling leggings online. She may have a soft spot for him despite the impersonal nickname she insisted on calling the boy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yessss! I’m going to text him now. He’s going to be pumped.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha really tried to have a no phone policy at the dinner table, but she couldn’t exactly enforce that when her son was so excited to share the news. It would be cruel.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Go ahead,” she sighed dramatically, shooing him off with a smile on her face to let him know she wasn’t truly upset.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky needed no further words as he slid out of his seat and ran to his room to grab his phone. She supposed dinner was finished, then.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha ran her fingers through her hair and sighed, standing up to clean. She knew Nicky wouldn’t be back from his room now that he had been allowed to use his phone. That was another reason she wanted to support the trip. It allowed her time to be with him, even if it meant chaperoning both him and his friends. At least now Billy would be able to come along as well. She could have paid for his trip on her own, but she knew the teen wouldn’t accept it. She had tried to do things like that for him before, given he was so close to her son, but he always felt guilty taking things she offered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      No, she’d use it as a fundraiser to allow him to go. Plus, now other students could go as well, so it wasn’t a lost cause, even if it meant being in the vicinity of Jennifer and Vidal.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Unfortunately for her though, as PTA president she was in charge of planning the trip including planning the itinerary, booking buses, reserving the exact number of hotel rooms, and paying for tickets for everyone for the theme park they were going to. Sure, she had plenty of time to do so, but it was tedious work and even worse when no one was willing to help her, not that she’d resort to asking.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She groaned and cleaned up from dinner before making her way to her bedroom to sit on her bed and pull out her laptop. No time like the present to get things done. She pulled up her email first, checking for the final numbers she needed which Alice was charged with collecting. She saw a message from the security guard, ever the reliable one even if her tastes in women were questionable. There was also an email from Vidal.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes and opened the message.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ms. Harkness,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As you are well aware, an administrator will be required to accompany the senior trip as a representative of the school. Unfortunately for each of us, I was the one chosen to attend. Add me to your list at your earliest convenience.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Disdainfully,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio Vidal, M.Ed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Principal
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Westview High School”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lovely. At least she could avoid her in the big park and keep the interactions at a minimum. Plus, she was positive the other woman wanted nothing to do with her either if the email sign off was anything to go by. Still, Rio Vidal always seemed to find a way to push her buttons. It would be an interesting few days.

      The day of the trip arrived much sooner than Agatha had anticipated despite having planned the whole thing basically on her own. Nicky, however, was very excited and made sure to remind her as soon as she walked out of her bedroom.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m all packed,” was the first thing he said when he saw her. She frowned, thinking it was much too early in the morning for such excitement.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Toothbrush?” she asked, knowing he had a penchant for forgetting things.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Underwear?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maaaaa,” he groaned, embarrassed at the mention as if she hadn’t changed his diapers for the first few years of his life.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Just checking,” she shrugged. “Charger?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky paused and turned around, running back to his room. Knew it. What would he do without her?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The rest of the morning went as smoothly as it could for an excited teenager and middle aged woman that hadn’t had her morning coffee. They stopped by Lilia’s to pick up Billy on their way and the two boys wouldn’t stop talking the entire drive. Was she ready to endure the 2 hour bus ride full of chatty teens just like them? Nope, but sacrifices must be made for those you love.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Once they parked in the school lot Agatha stood outside the bus, checklist in hand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Once I call your name, you can get on the bus,” she announced, ensuring everyone that was supposed to go on the trip was present and they didn’t leave anyone behind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nicky and Teen go ahead,” she waved the two off, obviously knowing they were already present. The boys needed no further permission and quickly got on the bus, hoping to get the best seats.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She continued rattling off names of various teens, marking them off as she went along. She was nothing if not organized which served her well given an extra person showed up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Excuse me, who are you?” she asked the additional adult who was most definitely not on her list.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Sharon. I’m chaperoning for Tommy Maximoff,” the woman with an annoyingly high pitched voice replied.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Who?” Agatha asked, scanning her list. “There’s no Shannon on here.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before she could respond, her least favorite person spoke up behind her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hi Sharon,” Vidal said in a cheery voice. “Ms. Harkness, Ms. Davis here asked me directly to chaperone. I approved it a week ago. Did I forget to mention it to you?” she asked in a falsely innocent voice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose and took a deep breath before responding. “You did.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hm. It must be difficult sorting things out when you don’t communicate your plans with other people.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      So that was what this was about. Vidal was getting back at her for not asking permission for the bake sale. Well, two could play that game.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It must have gone to spam. Since you’re close with her and I only booked rooms for the amount of people I knew were coming, I’m sure Ms. Vidal wouldn’t mind sharing a room with you, Ms. Davis.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She smirked, feeling the principal's rage from behind her and reveled in it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh dear, she can but I fear I’d keep her awake all night. See, I have to use a CPAP machine at night. Sleep apnea. It’s very loud,” Sharon explained.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groaned and shook her head as she waved the woman off. “I’ll…figure it out. Get on the bus and I’ll sort it out before we get there.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sharon happily left, leaving the principal and Agatha as the only two not on the bus. Agatha rounded on Vidal, pointing her pen at her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You did this on purpose,” she accused.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Vidal dramatically placed a hand on her chest as if surprised at the accusation. “Me? Why, I would never.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha glared at the response, knowing the woman took pleasure in her frustration. “Get on the bus, Vidal.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The principal simply grinned and skipped off to the bus, whistling some nonsensical tune probably to further piss Agatha off. It worked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Being the only one left, Agatha did a last check of the list before getting on the bus as well, telling the driver they were good to go. She glanced around to find a seat and what do you know? The only seat available was next to Vidal. The universe must really hate her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Come along,” Vidal said with a shit-eating grin, patting the empty seat next to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No.” Agatha looked around the bus for suitable replacements. “Ms. Davis, wouldn’t you like to sit next to Principal Vidal on the ride there?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh dear, I would but Tommy asked me to sit with him.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groaned. What teenage boy asked an adult to sit with them on a 2 hour ride instead of sitting with friends?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Fine, she’d sit with Vidal but she wouldn’t engage with her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As soon as she sat in the seat next to the infuriating woman, she grabbed her airpods and turned on music, finding it the most suitable option for ignoring the younger woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      While the bus drove to their destination, Agatha focused on the list of chaperones, trying to figure out who she could pair up. Jennifer and Alice were already in the same room so that wouldn’t work. Ms. Davis was apparently not an option. That only left one pairing, one she didn’t want to accept.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As she came to this realization, Vidal tapped Agatha on her shoulder, motioning for her to take an earbud out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha did so, knowing if she didn’t the woman would continue to bother her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?” she asked, not even trying to tone down the annoyance in her voice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Just wanted to say hi, roomie,” Vidal said with another shit-eating grin. Clearly Vidal came to the same conclusion as Agatha had, then.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re sleeping on the floor,” the older woman replied.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The fuck I am!” the principal responded, causing Agatha to raise an amused eyebrow.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not setting a great example for the students shouting such profanity, Vidal.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “They’re not even paying attention. I’m not sleeping on the floor.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well I certainly am not, so that’s the only option,” Agatha continued.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What? Afraid to have another woman in your bed?” Vidal taunted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha glared at the infuriating woman before leaning in so she couldn’t be overheard.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Getting women in my bed isn’t the problem, Vidal. It’s getting them
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       out
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      that’s the issue.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Vidal scoffed at the comment. “I doubt that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m sure you do, dear,” Agatha replied, dismissing the woman as she put her earbud back in, effectively ending the conversation. Or so she thought.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before she knew it, Vidal ripped the earbud out of her ear again, glaring at her. “I’m sleeping in the bed. I don’t care if you’re in it or not.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha matched the glare, snatching the ear piece back. “Touch my property again and I’ll have you fired.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m so scared,” the principal responded, rolling her eyes. “You like arguing with me too much to try. Admit it, you prefer me-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Horizontal?” Agatha cut the other woman off, causing Rio to pause. Huh? “In a grave?” Ah. That made more sense.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You wouldn’t be able to handle me horizontal,” the principal responded, ignoring the vaguely hidden death threat.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chuckled lowly, shaking her head. “Darling, you wouldn’t last a minute with me.”

     <span>
      The rest of the ride went as well as it could. Agatha had put the earbuds back in and thankfully didn’t have them snatched away again by the infuriating woman sitting next to her. Their conversation about the bed still ran through her head as they checked into their rooms. She’d prefer if the other woman stayed on the floor, but it appeared that wasn’t going to be an option.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Then there was the insinuation that the principal would destroy her in bed. Preposterous. If she didn’t loathe the woman so much, she’d be tempted to prove her wrong, but that was quite unprofessional, even if the woman was…
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       moderately
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      attractive.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha checked in to the hotel, handing each person their key cards before giving them a stern talk. “The rest of the afternoon is free, but that does not mean you can act like idiots. Someone will be on duty at all times. Bed by 9.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This was met by a series of groans but that was to be expected by the teens. She shrugged and made her way to her own room, Vidal following behind. Mercifully the woman didn’t speak until they entered the room.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I get the left side,” she called, pushing past Agatha to put her luggage on the bed and claim it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The older woman rolled her eyes and went about unpacking her own bag, claiming the set of drawers under the tv stand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Did you leave any room for me?” The principal asked, a pile of clothes in hand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Sorry, drawers are for people who have the right side of the bed only,” Agatha snarked, shutting the drawer she had just filled.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fuck you,” Vidal responded, moving past her to put the clothes in the empty closet.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You wish,” Agatha replied easily. “You’re on kid duty. I’m going to the bar.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shot Agatha a glare. “And just why am I the one on duty?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The older woman shot the principal a smirk. “Because I’m in charge of the trip. If I say you do it, you do it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I despise you,” the younger woman groaned.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The feeling is mutual, dear. Have fun!” Agatha replied with a smirk before leaving the room.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She could hear a frustrated grunt as she walked down the hall which only made her even more satisfied. Sure, she hadn’t planned on sharing a room with the principal but if this were to be the case, at least she could have fun riling her up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Once she made it to the bar she ordered the most expensive merlot they had, intending to spend the evening relaxing and potentially getting just drunk enough that she wouldn’t have to think about sharing a bed with the woman who gave her so much turmoil for no reason.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      How dare she rip her earbud out on the ride there? How dare she pointedly refuse to meet with her to discuss funding? How dare she undermine her and add another chaperone, leading her to their current rooming situation? Agatha gripped the glass hard and downed the contents.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Another,” she said to the bartender. “Keep a tab open.” It was going to be a long night.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It took only a few more glasses before she knew the alcohol had its intended effect. She felt the pleasant buzz in her body, making it feel weightless while she walked back to her room. Perhaps she indulged a bit more than she should have, but in her mind it was worth it to get over the rooming situation she was stuck with.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She stumbled into the room moments later, kicking off her shoes with reckless abandon before she even noticed the younger woman in the bed, sitting with a book in her lap.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wow, first night in and you’re already wasted,” the principal said, eyebrow raised curiously at Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I need it to deal with you,” the older woman replied, grabbing pajamas to change into.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Should I be concerned that an alcoholic is in charge of the PTA?” Vidal responded, shutting the book in her lap.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Considering I’m not one, I’d say no,” Agatha replied before walking into the bathroom and shutting the door, effectively ending the conversation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Had she overindulged tonight? Perhaps, but it was necessary. Plus, she couldn’t remember the last time she had been drunk. Vidal just wanted to push her buttons.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She scrubbed off her makeup and changed into her silk pajamas. Were they revealing? Yes, but when she packed them she hadn’t known she’d have to be sharing a room so they were her only option.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha returned to the room and climbed in the bed, leaving as much space between herself and the principal as possible, unaware of the look she was receiving from said woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That’s what you packed to wear on a school field trip?” Vidal asked, judgment laced in her tone.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shot the woman a glare but made it a point to sit up straight, accentuating the fact the material left little to the imagination. “I hadn’t planned on being seen by anyone. What’s the problem, dear?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The principal scoffed at the comment. “The
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       problem
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      is you packed that to wear at a children’s field trip. What if there was an emergency in the middle of the night and you were needed?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Then I’d send the highly capable school administrator to handle it,” Agatha replied easily.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That’s not how this works,” Vidal responded, anger evident in her voice. “You don’t get to boss me around like you do with everyone else in your life. You owe me some respect.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha couldn’t help but to let out a cackle. “Respect? Give me one reason you deserve that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Vidal moved over, wanting to ensure Agatha truly heard her. “Because whether you believe it or not, I’m your superior.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The older woman saw red and without thinking reached out and placed her hand around the principal’s neck, moving to climb atop her to prevent her from wriggling away. “If you believe I can’t have you fired in a second, you’re even bigger an imbecile than I imagined.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio reached up and gripped the older woman’s wrist, holding tightly as she spit at her face. “Fuck you, Harkness.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If that's what she wanted, that was what she would get. Agatha tugged the principal to her and pressed a bruising kiss to her lips, perhaps messier than it would be if she were sober, but she also would not be driven to this if she hadn’t had anything to drink either.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It took the principal a second to recover from her shock before she kissed back, groaning at the pressure around her neck combined with the feeling of the older woman’s lips on her own.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Tell me you don’t want this, Vidal,” Agatha husked, grip remaining steady despite her altered state.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The principal glared at Agatha but said nothing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Tell me to stop and I will. Tell me you haven’t been thinking of this every time you yell at me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The only response was Rio shifting to reach up and pull Agatha back down to her lips. Agatha needed no further confirmation and allowed her tongue to slide in the principal’s mouth, moaning at the ability to have so much power over the woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She removed her hand from around the woman’s neck and shifted to cup her breast over her clothing. The response was immediate, Vidal moaning as she arched her back into the touch. Agatha chuckled into the kiss, knowing she had such an effect on the principal.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The older woman shifted, placing open-mouthed kisses down Vidal’s neck. Her hand moved lower, sliding beneath the waistband of the principal’s shorts. She immediately felt just how much the woman
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       hated
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Pathetic,” she huffed, sliding her fingers through the wetness. “I’ve barely done anything and you’re already like this.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Shut the fuck up,” Vidal growled, not looking as intense as she perhaps planned to pinned beneath the older woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha grinned maniacally, slipping a finger deep into Vidal’s center, effectively quieting the woman. “Not very mouthy now, hm?” Agatha taunted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio couldn’t respond, her body reacting despite her mind telling her she shouldn’t be doing this. She bucked her hips against Agatha’s hand, matching her rhythm.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “More,” the principal whined, causing Agatha to bite down on her collarbone. She responded though, sliding two more fingers in, thrusting at an uneven rhythm. Pathetically it barely took much longer before Vidal came undone, her body trembling with the aftershock of the efforts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha removed her fingers and rubbed them off on Rio’s shirt. “Pathetic. Go clean.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio lifted an eyebrow, post-sex clarity hitting her hard. Fuck, she hated Agatha, didn’t she? But god, the feeling of her hand around her neck, her lips against hers, the lingering taste of alcohol on her breath…fuck. She slid out of bed and shut herself in the bathroom, wondering what to do.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She splashed water on her face, hoping that it would help but no, she was still confused but with a moist face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio groaned and exited the bathroom, intending to address whatever had happened with Agatha but upon viewing the bed she saw the older woman passed out, deep asleep.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Tomorrow then. Tomorrow.

    <p>
     <span>
      The harsh light of day woke Agatha from her slumber, followed by the stark realization that she had a pounding headache. She may have overdone it the night before, but she didn’t regret it given she effectively reached her goal of not remembering a thing past the first few drinks at the bar.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She groaned and turned, almost forgetting she was sharing a bed with the reason she drank the night before. Rio was already awake and looking at Agatha with a confusing look she couldn’t decipher.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Watching a woman sleep is very concerning,” Agatha said, her voice groggy from just waking up. God, she needed ibuprofen and water stat.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Just making sure you’re alive after last night,” Vidal replied, sitting up in bed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why wouldn’t I be? I hardly overdid it,” Agatha lied.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What do you remember about last night?” the principal asked, her voice sounding smaller, though it must have been a trick of the mind. Agatha furrowed her brows, wondering if this was a trick.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The bar, drinking, then coming back and sleeping.” Okay, the last part was a lie but she knew at some point she had made her way to the room to sleep given that was where she woke up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hm,” the principal hummed, expression unreadable.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t have time for your probing,” Agatha groaned, sitting up in bed to get up and grab something to dull the headache pounding in her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio rolled her eyes and followed suit, sliding out of bed to grab her clothes to change into for the park. She mused to herself while changing in the bathroom about the night before. Had Agatha really not remembered what happened or was she just pretending so she didn’t have to address it? Knowing the older woman she was leaning towards her not remembering given she’d most likely taunt her about the events if she could recall them, but she couldn’t be positive.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When she stepped out of the bathroom, she noticed Agatha had changed as well, wearing a pair of jeans, tennis shoes, and plain tshirt. It was the most casual she had seen the woman and honestly it wasn’t a bad look. Far from it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Took you long enough. Move,” Agatha said, pushing past Rio to shut herself in the bathroom.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The moment Agatha saw her reflection in the mirror she winced. She looked exactly how she felt– a mess. She didn’t have any energy to put in the effort to brush her hair so she ran her fingers through it and settled for that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She contemplated the way Vidal had been acting when she woke up. She wasn’t immediately hostile, which was unusual for the woman. She seemed subdued in a way but she couldn’t figure out why and honestly it would use too much of her brain power to try to decipher that enigma, so she pushed the thought aside and went about brushing her teeth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Back in the room Rio ran her hand through her hair, trying to sort through her feelings. She couldn’t tell Agatha about last night, knowing she wouldn’t believe her if she even tried. Did she want to try? She wasn’t sure, but she did know whatever she felt about the woman before yesterday had shifted and she wasn’t sure she liked that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Come on, let’s go,” Agatha’s voice broke through Rio’s thoughts. Ah, bossy as ever. They  made their way to the lobby, most students already there, surprisingly. She supposed she shouldn’t be surprised given they were headed to the park.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright, you all know your assigned chaperones. Ms. David’ group will be accompanied by Principal Vidal-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Actually, they won’t. Thanks Ms.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Davis
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      for volunteering to come. I believe you are a fully capable chaperone and I will roam between groups to ensure everyone is being civil.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha clenched her hand in a fist and shot a glare at Vidal. She didn’t want to be babysat by the woman. She wouldn’t stand for it, but that was an argument to be had outside the vicinity of the school seniors.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Fine
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      . Everyone get on the bus.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She watched as everyone filed out, Vidal attempting to as well, but she shot her arm out to prevent the woman from moving further.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What do you think you’re-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What are you playing at, Vidal?” Agatha asked, cutting the woman off from her frustrated tirade.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio immediately put on a falsely innocent face. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. As principal it’s my duty to ensure everyone is abiding by the rules. Especially ones being supervised by a woman with a hangover.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The older woman shot the principal a glare at the call out. “I’m perfectly fine.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fine, hm? Then you wouldn’t mind getting on a ride when we get to the park?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I wouldn’t do that no matter the circumstance,” Agatha shot back.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hm. That sounds like an excuse to me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes, not giving into Vidal’s goading. “Get on the bus.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “As you wish…m’lady,” the principal responded, bowing to Agatha in a ridiculously dramatic way before heading off to the bus.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It took so much effort for Agatha to resist the urge to fight the woman, but she somehow managed. To say it would be a long day would be more than accurate.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      —-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They somehow made it to the park without incident, even if Agatha was stuck sitting next to Vidal yet again on the ride over. Soon enough, she was walking with Nicky and Teen through the entrance, the principal trailing behind. Honestly it was very frustrating to know she was acting like some sort of watchdog, but Agatha made it a point to act like it didn’t bother her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We have to go to the biggest ones first before the lines get long,” Nicky said, walking at too fast a pace for Agatha’s liking. Truly she had no clue why someone would be so excited to ride these death traps. She couldn’t see the appeal at all.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t go too far,” she warned, glad she chose sensible shoes over her usual heels.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maaa, we have to. Come on,” Nicky urged. Of course she couldn’t say no to him, so she quickened her pace.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not too bossy now, hm?” the grating voice of the principal spoke up behind her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha turned and shot a glare at the woman, getting even more frustrated when she caught up to her. “I’m only rude to those who deserve it,” she replied, making a point not to look at the woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Sooo, everyone but your son?” Rio probed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Precisely,” Agatha responded without shame.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They walked in blissful silence for a few minutes before they reached the first ride. The boys ran ahead to get in line and Agatha happily found a bench to sit and wait for them. Unfortunately for her, Rio decided to sit beside her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Again, I don’t need babysitting,” Agatha snarked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe I just like spending time with you,” the principal replied, causing Agatha to laugh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Right. Says the woman who actively avoids meeting with me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shrugged, her attitude somehow different than usual but Agatha couldn’t put a pin on why. “I am a busy woman.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Busy every time I try to schedule a meeting?” she asked, raising an eyebrow.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe that’s just for my amusement.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re infuriating,” Agatha groaned.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That’s not what you said last night,” Rio responded quickly, immediately regretting it. Honestly last night was still confusing for her, but Agatha didn’t exactly act like she
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       liked
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      her, more liked the idea of having power over her which despite everything she truly didn’t mind from Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What are you talking about?” Agatha asked, remembering the younger woman’s words from the morning asking if she remembered the prior night. Did something happen she didn’t remember?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That was awesome!” Teen’s excited voice interrupted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha turned to see the two boys practically bouncing to go ride the next death trap. Honestly they reminded her more of children in this moment than moody teens, not that she was complaining. She found it sweet, even if it did cut off her conversation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “C’mon, let’s go!” Nicky said, wasting no time in tugging Agatha’s hand to pull her up from the bench and drag her to the next ride. She rolled her eyes but smiled, enjoying her son’s enthusiasm.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She followed along until they reached the next contraption. She fully intended to sit down again before Teen spoke up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’ve gotta ride this one, Ms. Harkness!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I will do no such thing,” she scoffed, crossing her arms.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Scared?” The principal asked, too close for Agatha’s comfort.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I value my life,” Agatha responded, undeterred by the goading from the younger woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Come on, Ma. Please?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Damn it. Nicky asking in that voice of course made her say yes. He knew it was her weakness and clearly he was using it to his advantage.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ms. Vidal, you should come too so she doesn’t have to sit with a stranger,” Teen voiced, looking conspiritally at Nicky. What were they planning?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well we can’t have that,” Rio replied happily, looking her arm through Agatha’s before the older woman quickly tore her arm away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha reluctantly followed the boys to the queue of people waiting to board. How the hell did she let herself get roped into this?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She looked over and saw Vidal had a look of glee in her eyes, the woman practically bouncing on her toes. It seemed fitting someone like her would enjoy this so much.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Next passengers boarding. Remain seated and pull the safety bar towards you,” a dull voice rang from the speakers. Great. Time to get it over with.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Truth be told, Agatha’s heart was pounding. She had a fear of heights and the drop on this thing looked way too high for her liking. She pulled the safety bar as close to her as possible, not wanting to take any risk of her falling out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nervous?” Rio’s voice broke through her thoughts. She sounded genuine, a change from her typical goading behavior. That didn’t mean Agatha trusted her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m perfectly fine,” Agatha replied, forcing herself to look confident.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Of course that immediately changed when the ride started moving. Her face visibly paled and she gripped hard on the bar. They slowly crept up the first drop, the anxiety building in Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio turned her head and saw the woman’s unmasked fear and didn’t even think before reaching out to grip her hand, hoping it would ground her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Given any other circumstance Agatha would rip her hand away, but seeing as she felt she was about to die, she gripped the hand tightly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The dreaded drop came before Agatha knew it and her stomach felt like it went straight up to her throat. Meanwhile, Rio was screaming and laughing maniacally. How could someone enjoy something like this?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her grip tightened even more, uncaring if she was hurting the woman. It appeared Rio didn’t mind anyway given her wild screams of joy continuing all the way to the end.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As the ride slowed to a stop, Agatha extracted her hand from Rio's, the younger woman still letting out a few chuckles from the adrenaline rush.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Thank you,” she said softly, only just enough for Rio to hear her. She didn’t look the woman in her face, embarrassed at her reaction and the fact she sought comfort from her mortal enemy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You must do a lot of shit just because Nicky asks you to,” Rio said in reply, looking at Agatha curiously.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “He’s all I have. Of course I do. I’d do anything to make him happy,” Agatha explained, unsure why she was revealing all of this to Vidal.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio returned her hand to Agatha’s and squeezed lightly. “I think that’s admirable. Especially when it lets me see you so freaked out,” she chuckled, unable to keep from teasing the woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It won’t happen again,” Agatha grumbled, quickly exiting the coaster to escape the woman’s touch.

      “You think it worked?” Nicky asked Billy as they rushed off the ride, trying to get out of eyesight before Agatha and Rio exited as well.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I saw them holding hands, dude,” Billy said, a twinkle in his eye as their plan was unfolding as they planned.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky had come to Billy last night and discussed his desire for his mother to be happy. It wasn’t unknown to him that she didn’t really have friends. He was happy to spend time with her and knew she loved doting on him, but he didn’t want to be the only one she let her guard down for.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It wasn’t a secret that his mother had a history with his principal. He had witnessed her arguing with her many times and often heard her ranting about the woman even when they were home. It took him a while, but recently he wondered if there was a different reason behind his mother’s slight obsession with talking about Vidal, even if she didn’t recognize it. He had seen a few people his mother dated over the years and knew enough to know she was his mother’s type at the very least.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy was all for the plan when Nicky brought it up to him. It was him that came up with the idea of getting the two to get on the ride together. Part two was all Nicky, though. It may be a little cruel, but he had a feeling it would work to his advantage in progressing the plan.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Come on, we have to go before they see us.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Part two: disappear so the two would be stuck together. Would his mom freak out? Probably, but he was 17, hardly the same fear a parent would get if their toddler were to be missing instead.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      He and Billy made their way around the park, going to the far end as Agatha would most likely initially assume they were nearby somewhere waiting for the two women to catch up. If this all went according to plan, his mom would be talking about his principal in a very different way.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      —
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha walked out of the exit, surrounded by excited teens scrambling to get their next adrenaline rush on another ride. She was more than happy to stay firmly planted on the ground and wait after being coaxed into riding.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Then there was the Vidal factor. The woman holding her hand on the ride was uncharacteristically sweet, but it didn’t mean she wanted to keep it up. The principal could fuck off for all she cared, which she didn’t. Definitely not.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If Agatha thought about it, she wasn’t entirely sure how they became so hostile towards each other. It wouldn’t be completely surprising if it was her own doing given she had a penchant for pushing people away to avoid them getting too close and hurting her. Thanks Evanora and the lingering trauma she left behind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Still, she could acknowledge it may be her fault but she still didn’t want to get close to Vidal. The principal had a knack for getting under her skin and peeling away the layers she didn’t want people to see. Her natural response was to lash out, a pattern that lasted the entirety of Nicky’s high school career.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha glanced around the area where the people exiting the ride funneled out, looking to spot her son and Teen. They exited before her, she knew that much, but she couldn’t see them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Where’d they go?” Vidal spoke up, voicing Agatha’s thoughts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “They probably just walked a little further ahead,” the older woman replied, trying not to let the small bit of anxiety show though she hastened her pace. The boys didn’t appear to be anywhere in the vicinity of the exit, which was unlike them. Nicky had never been one to just wander off without telling Agatha where he would be going.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m not seeing them,” the principal said unnecessarily.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha turned towards her and snapped. “I’m aware of that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, I’m trying to help you. Being pissed off isn’t going to do anything to help,” Rio replied, walking closer to Agatha than she would like. “Come on, we’ll go look around. Where did they say they wanted to go next?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha closed her eyes and took a breath before centering herself. Vidal was right, but she was worried and the principal was the closest thing to lash out on.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “They wanted to go on The Raptor,” she said, trying to collect herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay, we’ll head there and look,” Rio said in an annoyingly calm voice. How could she be so put together when two of her subjects were missing?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha led the way silently, glancing around at the park attendees as she passed them, scanning them for Billy’s lanky body or Nicky’s long hair, but she saw neither. It wasn’t long before she arrived at the ride the boys said they would be going to but there was still no sign of them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe they’re in line?” Rio hypothesized, looking over to Agatha who was having a harder time keeping herself composed. “Let’s sit and wait for the next few rides to see if they come out of the exit,” she suggested.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nodded and walked to the bench, her eyes glued to the exit of the ride once seated. She nervously picked at her nails, a habit her mother scolded her on many times as a child but something she couldn’t break. Nicky had to be here. She wasn’t sure what she would do if he wasn’t.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A soft hand on her own broke her thoughts abruptly and Agatha turned to look at Vidal in question.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s going to be okay. They probably just got too excited about the rides and didn’t realize we weren’t following them,” the principal said in a calming tone, her hand squeezing Agatha’s reassuringly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What if they didn’t?” Agatha couldn’t help but to ask.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Then we figure it out. We can get park security if we need to. Has he texted you about where he is?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Shit. In her panic, Agatha hadn’t even thought about her phone. She pulled it out quickly, seeing no notification from him, but she called his phone anyway. The phone rang…and rang…and rang. Agatha once again squeezed Rio’s hand tightly, the fear different from riding on the coaster earlier, but still very real.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She felt a lump form in her throat when the phone continued to ring. Where was her baby? Did he get kidnapped? Sure, he was 17 and tall for his age but it could still happen. He wouldn’t run off without her. It wasn’t like him. It wasn’t-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hello?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha released a silent sob she had been holding in when she heard her son’s voice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nicky, where are you?” she asked, trying to keep the fact that tears were now running down her face out of her voice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We’re at The Apocalypse, we told you we were going there.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No you did not,” she said, shaking her head though he couldn’t see it. “Stay there. We’re coming soon.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah, bye Ma.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The call ended and Agatha wiped the tears from her eyes, though it was pretty useless given they were still coming.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are they okay?” Vidal asked, surprising Agatha briefly as she had forgotten the woman was even there despite her holding her hand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Y-yes. They’re at a different ride,” Agatha replied, staring at the ground to calm her breathing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s okay,” Rio said, wrapping her arms around Agatha without notice. “They’re okay.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha hadn’t anticipated the embrace, but strangely welcomed it. Rio somehow kept her centered throughout her momentary panic and helped her come up with a solution to the problem.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She pulled back after a moment and sighed. “Thank you. If anyone asks, this didn’t happen,” she said, a soft chuckle escaping her lips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mmm, like last night didn’t happen,” Rio replied, causing Agatha to look over at her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That’s the second time you’ve brought that up.What are you trying to say?” she asked, standing up so they could make their way to the boys.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You really don’t remember? I know you hate me but fuck, I didn’t realize it was this much.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t ha-,” she shook her head, breaking herself from the thought to cut to the chase. “What happened, Vidal?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio grabbed Agatha’s hand to stop her from walking and looked at her. “Let’s say I’m surprised I don’t have bruises on my neck. And you’re not half bad at kissing, among other things.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha froze, short flashes of what Rio was hinting at popping in her mind. Did she really…? “I did that?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You did,” Rio confirmed, her grip remaining on Agatha’s hand. “And despite what you may believe I think of you, I didn’t mind it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Oh. Fuck. The whole basis of Agatha hating Vidal was
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       because
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      she was afraid to get too close but apparently that was all out the window now. She wanted to regret getting drunk and allowing herself to let go but a part of her was relieved it happened and even more relieved Vidal didn’t seem too upset about it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why?” she asked simply.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why what? Why don’t I mind?” Rio asked, her eyebrow raised in question. She continued when Agatha nodded. “Agatha, I never hated you. Yes, you get under my skin and yes I may have made myself busy to avoid you but I never hated you. I mean, you’re a single mother raising one of the most accomplished kids in the school and doing everything you can to make him happy. Yes, the ways you go about it are perhaps not the best…or the most ethical, but you do it because you love him. I can’t be angry at that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This was what she had intended to avoid by pushing the woman away. It was like she could see through her in a way no one else could and that scared the shit out of her. But…
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Did I really..?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio chuckled and nodded. “Yeah, and it was fucking hot.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s eyes darkened at the comment and god she wished she could remember everything that went down the night before. Perhaps tonight could be a sober redo.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We will continue this conversation later. In private.” Agatha started walking back in the direction of the ride Nicky said he would be at, Rio trailing behind with a stupid grin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I very much look forward to that,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Ms. Harkness.
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>

      The moment Agatha and Rio caught up with the boys, the teenagers immediately could tell there was a shift in the dynamics between the two. They never said or did anything to explicitly give it away, but Nicky had spent 17 years with his mother which was more than enough to know when she was acting shut off like she normally did with others. When she thought no one was looking, it seemed she even had a smile.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky glanced at Billy and gave him a low high five behind his back, hidden from the two adults. It looked like their plan worked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ma, you should get on this ride too,” he spoke up, causing Agatha to scoff.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nicholas Sage Harkness, I will absolutely not be getting on another one of those contraptions for as long as I live.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Damn, she pulled the whole name,” Billy teased, nudging Nicky with his elbow.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Watch your language, Teenager or I’ll tell Lilia,” Agatha was quick to quip, causing Billy’s eyes to widen.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Sorry, Ms. Harkness. Please don’t tell her. She gets…kooky when I do something wrong.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha held back her grin and waved the two boys off. “Go. But bring your asses back here when you get off. No running off.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The boys didn’t need to be told twice. They left quickly, Billy’s “why can she curse but I can't?” drifting over to her as they departed. Only once the two were out of sight did Agatha allow herself to chuckle. They certainly were something else, but she loved them all the same.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You really do love them,” Rio said, sitting down next to Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Please stop or I won’t be able to stop myself from kissing you in the park and risk all the students seeing,” Agatha responded, unafraid to discuss her attraction to the woman openly now given she apparently already did so the night before and it was clearly reciprocated.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’d have no complaints,” Rio shrugged, her signature smirk gracing her lips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m sure you wouldn’t,” Agatha smirked. “But you’ll have to wait for tonight.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If anyone told her before today that she’d be openly flirting with the principal and enjoying it, she’d stare at them in disbelief, yet there she was doing exactly that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Their flirtatious banter continued throughout the day, only when the boys weren’t around of course. How to act around them would be a discussion for another day. It wasn’t long, though it felt like eons, before they were back in their shared room. Agatha assigned Jen as the adult on duty because she couldn’t help but to rile the woman up, but that also gave her the excuse to have free time with Rio without having to be careful around others and she intended to use that time to her advantage.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, last night,” Agatha began almost as soon as the door shut to their room.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes?” Rio asked, the smirk a constant since they began flirting.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Run me through it. Details.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s face reddened, but she sat down on the edge of the bed and began to recount the event. “We were fighting. I don’t even remember what we were fighting about but then you grabbed me by the throat…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Damn, Agatha hadn’t been that forward with anyone before. At least it seemed the woman didn’t mind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And then it turned into kissing. I didn’t do anything, or I didn’t
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       get
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      to do anything. I wanted to, but you are very demanding,” Rio chuckled. “It didn’t last long, the whole thing, but you fucked me and then told me to clean up. And then you passed out.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s eyebrows raised at the description of the events. She wished she could remember them, but there was no taking that back. She could certainly control the present though. Agatha moved to stand in front of Rio, her finger lifting the woman’s chin to look up at her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And you turned soft for me after one drunken fuck, hm?” she asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s eyes darkened at the question. “I never said I wasn’t soft for you before then. You just never seemed to reciprocate until last night.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh? How often have you thought about me, Vidal?” Agatha questioned, moving to straddle Rio’s lap. “Do you think about me at night?” she asked, leaning in to whisper besides the woman’s ear. “Do you touch yourself thinking of me when you’re alone in bed?” Her tongue darted out to lick the shell of Rio’s ear.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio chuckled softly and put a gentle hand on Agatha’s shoulder, pushing her back so they could face each other. “You asked the same questions last night,” she smirked. “The answer is still yes.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s eyes darkened, the pupils increasingly erasing the icy blue of her irises. “Then let’s not waste time on repeating conversations,” she replied, her hand moving to the back of Vidal’s neck to bring her closer, finally connecting their lips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She didn’t rush the kiss, though a part of her desperately wanted to. The desire to savor the action won over. Agatha wanted to memorize every moment, having a need to make up for the night before.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her tongue ran along the bottom of Vidal’s plump lower lip, the principal eagerly letting her in. God, if this was any ounce similar to last night there was no wonder Rio acted so strange in the morning.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The younger woman moaned into the kiss, sending heat straight to Agatha’s core. She hadn’t
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       not
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      thought about the woman in this context before, but she never deluded herself into believing it would go anywhere beyond her imagination. Now that she had her, she intended to explore the fantasies she created in her mind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s hands traveled lower, from Rio’s neck down to the hem of the woman’s shirt. She broke from the kiss to look into the principal’s eyes in question.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Please,” Rio replied, eagerly giving Agatha permission to remove the top. Agatha was gentle, making sure not to tug too hard. Once the shirt was removed, the older woman leaned back to take Vidal in.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I vaguely remember you saying something about my pajamas last night, but you end up wearing this?” Agatha asked, staring at the sheer black bra that left little to the imagination given she could see right through.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio chuckled, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of Agatha’s shirt. “It’s a bit different given no one would see it unless I had no shirt on.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha raised her arms, allowing Rio to remove her own shirt. “I suppose you have a point,” the older woman hummed, reaching behind Rio’s back to unhook the bra in one deft movement. She pulled the bra off and tossed it to the side, admiring the view in front of her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m not complaining about being the one to see you without your shirt,” Agatha smirked, gently pushing Rio down, guiding her to lay on the bed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She slid off Rio’s lap and took off her own bra, bringing her pants down with it and discarding them off the floor before she crawled back on the bed and resumed her position atop the principal.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fuck,” Rio husked, her hands moving to reach up to Agatha’s chest, but the older woman stopped her, gripping her wrists to move them above her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Me first,” she explained, leaning down to press kisses down the younger woman’s chest, savoring the little noises of pleasure escaping Rio’s lips. She made her way to one of Rio’s breasts and took the nipple between her lips, teeth grazing it lightly. The younger woman’s back arched into Agatha, encouraging her to continue. Agatha used her free hand to palm the principal’s other breast, not wanting to neglect any part of her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha,” Rio moaned, the sound of her name escaping the younger woman’s lips sending heat through her body.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha moved up, capturing Rio’s lips with her own, removing her hand from the woman’s wrists. Rio took the freedom eagerly, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s back, her nails digging in which caused the older woman to moan into the kiss. Rio made sure to commit that sound to memory.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha broke the kiss, her hands moving to unhook and unzip the younger woman’s pants. Rio ungracefully tugged them off and tossed them to the side, her own hands reaching to grip the edge of Agatha’s underwear.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Getting impatient?” Agatha teased, though she allowed Rio to tug down the last remaining piece of clothing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I never got my turn last night,” Rio replied simply, lifting her hips so the older woman could tug off her own garment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mm, well I don’t remember most of last night so we’re even,” Agatha teased, bracing herself above Rio. That appeared to not please the younger woman though, as she reached up and pushed Agatha so she was laying on her side, each woman facing each other.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Then let’s do it together,” she challenged, a spark of excitement twinkling in her eyes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha raised an eyebrow in confusion while Rio reached for the older woman’s hand and guided it between her legs. Oh. Together.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio released Agatha’s hand now that it appeared she understood what she meant and reached out to Agatha, her fingers teasing her entrance. Agatha couldn’t hold back the moan at the delicate touch and responded in kind, her fingers circling Rio’s clit, feeling herself grow more wet at the reactions she was eliciting from the younger woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She leaned forward, kissing Rio passionately as she felt two fingers slip inside her. She bit Rio’s lip on accident at the unexpected action, but given the principal’s moan in response, she didn’t seem to mind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Not wanting to fall behind, Agatha curled her fingers after gliding them in, the younger woman gasping in response. She pressed her palm against Rio’s clit, matching the rhythm of her fingers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio wrapped a leg around Agatha, spreading wider as she matched Agatha’s pace. Her thumb traced the sensitive bundle of nerves between Agatha’s thighs, causing an immediate reaction from the older woman as her hips moved to match the motion.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Aga-” Rio gasped, trying to catch her breath. “I’m close.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t,” Agatha said, feeling the pressure slowly building.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Please,” the woman pleaded, her rhythm getting increasingly unsteady as she attempted to hold out for Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wait,” Agatha commanded, knowing she was getting closer. Sweat was beading on her forehead as she continued to move her hips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio tried her best but she couldn’t wait any longer and let the feeling wash over her. It took Agatha only a few more seconds before she experienced the same bliss Rio was feeling.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They both lay next to each other, hips jerking slightly as each of them waiting for the waves to subside. Once they caught their breath, each woman removed their fingers. Rio cleaned hers off in her mouth, looking directly at Agatha as she did so and fuck, it was the hottest thing she had ever witness.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha glanced at her and took her wrist, pulling it back to remove her fingers from her mouth so Agatha could replace them with her own. Rio moaned immediately, her tongue slowly swirling over each digit. Okay, nevermind.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       This
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      was the hottest thing Agatha had ever seen.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She slowly removed her fingers from Rio’s mouth and pulled her in for a short kiss.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I can’t believe I spent four years hating you when I could have had this,” Agatha said, chuckling softly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You only needed to ask,” Rio whispered, her hand reaching up to trace the sharp lines of Agatha’s face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mmm, well I have you now and I’ll be damned if I let you go.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m not going anywhere, Agatha.”
