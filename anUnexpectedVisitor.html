     Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      The Darkhold's magic wavers for a mere moment as Wanda completes her enchantment over the town of Westview, yet a mere moment is all it takes for the shroud of Agatha's secrecy to slip and for Rio to find her.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agatha's camouflage fails long before Wanda steals her magic, Rio find her at the beginning of Wandavision, chaos ensues.
     </p>
     <p>
      X
     </p>
     <p>
      Rio however, didn’t look upset at all to see her. If anything she looked thrilled, shooting a wolfish grin at Agatha over Wanda’s shoulder, as if to say
      <i>
       found you bitch
      </i>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      “Hello,” Wanda’s voice, which startled Agatha back into the present, was both infuriatingly pleasant and welcoming, “can I help you with something?”
     </p>
     <p>
      Rio’s sharp grin remained in place as those dark eyes of hers continued their slow perusal of Agatha's figure, taking her in from the bottom of her kitten heels, to the perfectly pinned dark curls around her face. At long last, her gaze slid away from holding Agatha hostage to answer Wanda’s question.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Hi neighbour, I was just passing by and thought it polite to introduce myself. I’m Rita Valdez, I live at number 17, just right down the street from here”.

     Notes
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Needed somewhere safe to exorcise these demons between episodes - I hope you enjoy!
     </p>
     <p>
      It's sort of semi-canon, but I have taken some liberties with canon regarding Rio and Agatha as we obviously don't know there backstory just yet :)

    <h2>
     A Characteristic Moment
    </h2>
   </div>
   <!--chapter content-->
   <div>
    <p>
     The energy source had been easy enough to sniff out, like a bloodhound on a fox she had found it quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had turned out to be a witch, a single witch, who whilst in the throes of unbearable grief, had bewitched an entire town to play make believe with her, like a spoiled child demanding creative control of the games at recess.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was hilarious really, how power in different hands could be used for different means. This particular witch for example, had used it to make real-life dolls of her neighbours which was an utter waste of such power. Yet the thought of it in more capable hands, in more knowledgeable hands, well, it would be unstoppable.
    </p>
    <p>
     From there the question was born, the question of
     <i>
      how
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      How
     </i>
     had this witch gathered such power within her palms. What had she traded, sold, bartered, or even stolen to gain power enough that her magic practically conjured itself, running on the conception of a thought, rather than the rituals of casting that Agatha herself had been taught and depended on for centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew then that this wouldn’t be a quick job; it would take time and it would take patience.
    </p>
    <p>
     The time needed, Agatha had plenty of. The patience however would be a stretch, yet for power like that, she would do what needed to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
     It hadn’t taken long to set herself up as a long-term resident of Westview. Just another neighbour who had been ensnared by an evil witch’s spell, who was amongst the ranks of people who could claim the title “victim”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph had been easy enough to enchant, man-child that he was. All she had to do was ensure the wi-fi didn’t go down, keep his fridge stocked with sugary snacks, and he would stay where she had put him. She was certain she had never known quite as content a prisoner as that airhead.
    </p>
    <p>
     His house would do as a base, although she had several severe opinions on the upholstery and the artwork was a bit bleak, almost morbid, which was saying something considering the fact she was an actual witch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her timing, fortunately, could not have been better, as she had managed to thread herself into the fabric of Westview just as those final scarlet tendrils had finished transforming every modern feature into it’s 1950’s equivalent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking down, Agatha was begrudgingly pleased to find herself dressed in a vintage swing dress, quite similar in fact, to the types of dresses she had chosen for herself during that actual decade. The colours of the chequered material were still a mystery to her however, as every shade of colour other than black, white, and grey had been strained from the town, like soap bubbles from a sponge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deciding to have some fun whilst undercover she gathered up a large potted plant from Ralph’s hallway, slapped a ribbon on it, and bustled over to greet the neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
     After all, the sooner she started to unpick Wanda’s mind, the sooner she would be able to gather all of that delicious power into her chest and wreak havoc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her first interaction with Wanda was going just as Agatha desired; she asked her questions, ran circles around the other woman and poked at her façade, eager to see how this all-powerful witch might twitch at having some of her less than perfect surfaces scuffed with questions pertaining to wedding rings and birthdays.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unfortunately though, that was as far as she got before her plan was derailed like a train careening off the tracks, for there was another knock at the door; three sharp raps of knuckles against wood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda looked surprised, as though shocked that her well-crafted sitcom was going off script.
    </p>
    <p>
     They both paused, unsure. Agatha glanced between Wanda, the door, and then at the faceless camera man for a cue or a hint.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, who could that be?” Wanda’s curiously polite, perfectly poised house-wife tone rang out into the empty space between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     With quick feet she stepped up to the front door and pulled it open. Immediately her face lifted into a courteous smile as the person on the doorstep was a stranger to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not to Agatha though,
     <i>
      not at all
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     For it was Rio Vidal, the bane of her existence, stood in the doorway, silhouetted by bright sunlight, looking for all intents and purposes like a long-lost star of the golden screen. Her dark hair was pulled up and away from her face in a side part, lightly curled and falling just above her shoulders. And Unlike Wanda and herself, Rio was dressed in tailored capris, with a snug white shirt neatly tucked in to the waistband of her trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like everything else, she was shrouded in the black and white colouring of 1950s network television, but this, if anything, simply amplified her beauty, causing the already naturally dark shades of her hair and eyes to pop against the neutrally grey background surrounding her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It only took a few short milliseconds for Agatha to register all of this information, for in the next few, her lips were drawing back in a fierce sneer and she was choking back a furious scream at having her ex-wife, of all people, show up unannounced.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hadn’t seen Rio Vidal for over a century, not that the distance of time nor geography actually made the pain of that unhealed gouge in her heart ache any less. If anything, it made the history of it all the heavier.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio however, didn’t look upset at all to see her. If anything she looked thrilled, shooting a wolfish grin at Agatha over Wanda’s shoulder, as if to say
     <i>
      found you bitch
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her stomach plummet then as evidently something had changed in Westview, something she had been unaware of. Something must have caused a weakness, or a breach in the Darkhold’s shroud of magic, that cape of darkness that had kept her hidden from Rio for so long.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Shit
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello,” Wanda’s voice, which startled Agatha back into the present, was both infuriatingly pleasant and welcoming, “can I help you with something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s sharp grin remained in place as those dark eyes of hers continued their slow perusal of Agatha's figure, taking her in from the bottom of her kitten heels, to the perfectly pinned dark curls around her face. At long last, her gaze slid away from holding Agatha hostage to answer Wanda’s question.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi neighbour, I was just passing by and thought it polite to introduce myself. I’m Rita Valdez, I live at number 17, just right down the street from here”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice was as dark and silky as it had been on the day they had met all those long years ago, and Agatha was proud of the way she stopped herself from shivering at hearing it again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda retained her expression of neighbourly friendliness, although the twitch of her eyebrow indicated that Rio’s sudden arrival and presence in her false world was as much a surprise to her as it had been to Agatha. Still, she was polite as ever when responding to Rio's introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh well isn’t that sweet, and such wonderful timing too. I'm Wanda, come on in!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda span with one hand still on the door handle and the other gesturing in front of herself, indicating for Rio to step inside before sweeping it outwards in Agatha's direction. Rio, staring at Agatha the entire time with a dark glare, stepped through the door to follow Wanda towards the couch, where she was quick to sprawl out, sitting not at all like a lady from the 1950s would.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You see Rita, Agnes also thought it a good time to drop by and say hello,” Wanda’s smile grew as she fell into the rhythm of her character, allowing the sharp edges of reality to be rubbed away by the false personality she had assigned herself, “I won’t worry over introducing you ladies, as surely you already know one another!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda laughed first and Agatha forced a loud bark of laughter only a few moments too late, intent as she was to continue on with her plan, even with the unexpected issue of
     <i>
      Rio Vidal
     </i>
     turning up as "Extra Number 7" in another witches absurd grief fantasy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t laugh at all, but she did widen her grin to show more of her teeth. It would have been unnerving if Agatha didn’t still find it attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Damn her.
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We sure do know each other, very well indeed,” Rio’s voice dropped a few octaves and the innuendo in her words was as clear as the day was bright.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha jumped in, speaking through gritted teeth, “Oh
     <i>
      Rita,
     </i>
     how lovely it is for you to drop by so...
     <i>
      unexpectedly
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at her, eyes intent and possessive in their perusal of her, “I would have dropped by much sooner if I could have”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her meaning was stark and the message between her words was clear. Agatha felt a mixture of emotions start pooling in her stomach: fear, apprehension, concern. All of those feelings were ones she had might have expected to feel at Rio's sudden reappearance in her life, yet what surprised her more were the other emotions swirling in amongst the rest; dashes of joy, flashes of nostalgia, and a sprinkling of relief at seeing her again. It was a confusing mess and Agatha felt it sensible to retreat, to take some space to reassess Westview’s chessboard now another player had been added into the mix so suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slapping both hands on her knees, she got to her feet with a bright, overly loud tone, “well, I had better be on my way. I have a whole turkey cooking in the oven and I just know Ralph won’t even notice the house is on fire until the television starts melting”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swept to the door, addressing Wanda over her shoulder, “feel free to pop by for a cool glass of iced tea whenever the notion takes you hon, I can’t wait to get to know you better. I’m sure we will be life-long lady friends”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Choosing not to say farewell to Rio and instead simply ignore her presence, Agatha grasped the door handle, along with the belief she had made a swift escape, when a hand weaved between her arm and the dip in her waist, trapping her own beneath it against the cool metal.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll walk you back and make sure you get home safe to
     <i>
      Ralph
     </i>
     ,” Rio’s voice was a whisper, so close she could feel the exhale of her words against the hot skin on the back of her neck. Agatha became all too aware then of the proximity of the body behind her, of it's warmth. Far closer than necessary in her opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wriggling slightly to free her hand, she drew her elbow forward before pushing it back harshly into Rio’s diaphragm. In order to cover the violence of her actions, she shot Wanda an overly shocked expression, leaning into the slapstick comedy that was so well adored during this era of television.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt Rio's hand loosen over her own and heard a small grunt the moment her elbow made contact, which was then promptly followed by the laugh track Wanda had somehow rigged to run whenever something remotely humorous happened.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s quite alright toots, I know the way”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hand tightened over hers again, her nails digging in sharply against the skin of Agatha's hand, “I
     <i>
      insist
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Realising there was no way out of this situation without physically fighting with her ex-wife, which wouldn’t be the first time nor the last, she sighed heavily, managing to claw a smile back onto her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     After all, she didn’t really want to fight with Rio in front of Wanda and break character so soon into her scheme, that would be risking her shot at snatching all of that lovely power.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine then hon, but only to my garden gate. I don’t need the neighbours making up rumours about me and my gal pal, alright?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced over her shoulder to study Rio’s expression, which she could see was wildly amused at Agatha's attempt at appearing straight.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rumours are ghosts of the truth,” she felt Rio’s nose nuzzle closer, disturbing the curls styled over her ear, “isn’t that what they say?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Coughing loudly, Agatha threw herself backwards in order to pull the door open, managing as she did so to loosen Rio’s hold on her hand. Taking a few desperate steps forward she put some much needed space between her body and Rio’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stumbling slightly in her fluster, she managed a final, “farewell Wanda, I’ll see you real soon. I’ll bring over a tuna and Jell-O pie for you and your husband to enjoy together, the Jell-O really absorbs that fishy taste, you won’t be able to get enough,” before beginning to storm back down the pathway, mumbling the entire way about rogue ex-wives and stupid green witches.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was hot on her tail, she knew this because she could hear her laughing as she started to skip after her, prancing from one side of the street to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t bother even attempting to insist the green witch leave her at the garden gate as she had asserted at Wanda’s house. Instead, she simply flew up her own pathway and slammed her front door open, leaving it swinging on it’s hinges, knowing that it was futile closing it anyway; Rio would just climb through the window or down the chimney if she did try and shut her out.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment they were alone and Agatha had spun around in her living room, fists clenched and crackling with purple, Rio shot her a dangerous grin and jumped, using the momentum of her body weight to push Agatha backwards and up against the wall, drawing that damn knife she insisted on carrying everywhere with her so she could press it against the soft skin between her clavicles.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve missed you,” Rio said, pitching her voice up girlishly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hate you,” Agatha spat through gritted teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How long has it been Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not long enough”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face darkened as the tip of her blade pressed more firmly against Agatha’s skin, causing her to wince slightly at the sting of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You hid from me, you wrapped yourself up in all that dark magic and you hid yourself away from
     <i>
      me
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt something she had felt only rarely in her long, long life: Guilt. Tendrils of the stuff started to claw up her throat, not so much at Rio’s words, but at the expression on her face, at the fury in her eyes that had so clearly been born from heartbreak.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knew why she had done it though, and she stood by that why even now.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was for the space she had so desperately needed after losing Nicky, after having him ripped away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, she had always known her and Rio’s relationship had been a co-dependent one. After all, the pain she had felt whilst being the executioner of their strange dynamic had been catastrophic enough, so she could only imagine the tsunami of fury and hurt that Rio would have experienced over all these years as the side of the coin who didn’t get a say, who didn’t get a choice when Agatha ripped herself away.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Rio had done to Agatha what she herself had done to Rio, leaving Agatha alone in a world without her or Nicky before hiding in a way so she could never find her, well, Agatha would have summoned Rio in the only way she was certain she couldn't have ignored, without breaking any of her own ground rules that is.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she could understand Rio’s upset, she got it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But still, there was a lot at stake and she didn’t need a vengeful ex ruining the scheme she was running right now, especially when the pay out of power would be beyond anything else she had ever experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you here? How did you even get in this...
     <i>
      thing
     </i>
     too?” she waved a hand around herself, indicating the black and white world they were both wrapped up within.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned again, her eyes widening with that edge of madness that her ex-wife always seemed to be flirting with. It made Agatha’s heart sputter to life in her chest, like a little electric shock of longstanding attraction had just been applied to it's flesh, awaking the old muscle after a long slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wanted to see you, and I wanted to know what you were up to,” Rio glanced around, casually taking in the furniture and features from another time, “there is a lot of power bubbling in this town, all thrumming under the surface. Can you feel it Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took another step closer, bracketing Agatha’s kitten heels with her leather saddle shoes, so close that whenever Agatha breathed out and her chest expanded the material of her dress grazed Rio’s shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can feel it Rio,” Agatha tried to laugh, but it came out more like a strangled gasp at feeling Rio so close to her again, “why do you think I’m here”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The green witches’ lips twitched in amusement as she stared down at Agatha’s face, eyes burning a trail from her eyes, down to her lips, before dropping even lower to take in the remaining space between them. Frowning slightly, she took another half step closer, eliminating the space entirely by pressing the length of her torso against Agatha’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     As much as they would deny it, even under oath, the moment their bodies touched they both sighed as though an ancient weight had at long last been lifted from their shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does it feel like
     <i>
      me
     </i>
     Agatha? Does it feel like
     <i>
      my
     </i>
     power to you? Like
     <i>
      home
     </i>
     ? Is that why you want it so badly?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s question exposed Agatha in a way she despised. She hadn’t prepared for this; for this sudden reunion, Rio’s abundance of questions, nor her intoxicating presence.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Agatha shifted the focus back to the issue at hand, “what’s your play here exactly? You came here, dressed the part, and even thought of an alias, didn’t you
     <i>
      Rita
     </i>
     . So what is it you want? Why are you here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked, “I haven’t decided yet. All I know is that this is where you were, so I came to find you. I might have to nip off now and again, you know…” she lowered her voice, as though they were sharing secrets, “for a business trip or two. But yeah, I think I will stay for the time being, at least until I figure out what exactly it is I am feeling, or what exactly it is I want to do to you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She added pressure to the knife still poised at Agatha’s throat, nicking the skin and causing a hot trail of blood to weep down the hollow of her throat, the red coming through as a dark black against the white of her skin in their current monochromatic world.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need to figure out how I am going to punish you. But until then, I will watch you flounder here, grappling against powers you haven't even begun to grasp or understand”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gasped at both the pain and the pulse of heat she could feel low in her stomach at Rio’s words. Her eyes started to water as she bared her teeth in an expression that resembled a grin. However before she could respond, Rio took two steps backwards and slid her knife back into its sheath on her belt.
    </p>
    <p>
     A mask descended over Rio's features then, as though she really was just a neighbour dropping by to ask for a cup of sugar or a couple of eggs. She started to walk towards the front door, turning only to murmur two words to Agatha, who was still pressed up against the wall as though Rio had left a shade of herself in her living room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Te Veo”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those damningly familiar words finally jolted Agatha away from the wall towards the couch, where with a hiss she grabbed a pillow  in order to scream herself hoarse.

   <div>
    <p>
     Agatha had kept herself busy over the remainder of the 1950s, doing as all good housewives should and spent her time ignoring her fake husband, studying witchcraft, preparing her basement for magical emergencies, and avoiding her ex-wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had attempted to gain entry to her house multiple times, but now that Agatha knew the green witch was also residing in Westview, she had taken some time to put up a few magical defences against unwanted intruders. Her work had resulted in several roars of frustration resounding from the porch, which were much like music to her ears as she sipped her morning coffee, twitching the curtains aside to wave at Rio, even letting her dressing gown slip down her shoulder slightly just to rub salt in the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not that her defensive spells were much help to her whenever she left her house, keen as she was to keep up appearances as the nosy neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, her luck held out for a short while and they didn’t have a proper run in for a few more days, not until the day Agatha awoke to find everything around her had changed once more, modernising in one easy sweep to appear 10 years newer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda had fancied a change evidently.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, the 1960s. Another wonderful decade, if not one of the best to be a witch in modern America. Agatha was sure she hadn’t worn a bra once over the entire era.
    </p>
    <p>
     Studying her own personal upgrades in the mirror she frowned, unhappy to see that her clothing was far closer to the more conservative dresses of the 50s. She had been hoping for something slightly more liberal. A nice off the shoulder peasant blouse maybe, with a long skirt, chain belt, and a pair of tinted teashade's would have done the job nicely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh well. It would appear Wanda’s impression of the 60s was far more rigid, which considering what she had learnt about Wanda’s youth in the Soviet Union came as no real surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sighing, she grabbed Señor Scratchy, who she had already tucked away in his travel cage, ensuring he had plenty of lettuce leaves and carrots to nibble on throughout his afternoon, and made for Wanda’s house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Befriending the other woman had been a surprisingly easy job. As it turns out, Wanda was desperately lonely, even with her enchanted husband at her side. She had a keen ear and was very eager to be a hearty member of her captured community, always offering to help with different events whether it be calling the numbers at bingo, or helping to organise an afternoon tea dance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Today Agatha had arranged to drop Señor Scratchy off with Wanda as he was to be part of Wanda and Vision’s magic act. The irony of which was indeed not lost on her, that a genuine witch’s familiar was helping in a so-called
     <i>
      magic
     </i>
     show consisting of childish parlour tricks. Still, the loan of her dearest pet bought her something valuable; Wanda’s trust.
    </p>
    <p>
     She made it to Wanda’s house without any interruption’s, handed Señor Scratchy over, and had even managed a banterous exchange with Dennis the mailman. Yet just as she was righting herself after judging the state of Dennis’s polyester uniform, she felt a presence behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha closed her eyes, preparing herself mentally.
    </p>
    <p>
     For she knew precisely who was lurking behind her, as she always knew when Rio was near. It was a skill impossible to not pick up after centuries of loving a person. Although the simmer of power she could immediately sense sparking over the back of her neck was always a bit of a giveaway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moments later, she felt warm hands slide over the dip of her waist to tug her back into a firm torso, as a pair of warm lips nuzzled beside her ear to whisper a single word, “boo”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt herself instantly melting back into the embrace, the motion of which felt as natural to her as breathing. Yet the moment she saw Wanda returning from placing Señor Scratchy inside her home, she jerked away from Rio’s touch, suddenly remembering that Westview, at least currently-cursed Westview, possessed the mindset of the 1960s, where being seen in the arms of another woman would win you a prison sentence, and not a colourful parade through 5th Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned quickly, intent on telling Rio to pack it in when her tongue caught on the roof of her mouth and seemed instantly content to stay there. Her eyes popped wide as they dropped down to take in the extent of Rio’s outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Fucking Hell.
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had probably designed it herself, for she was the only resident in Westview wearing an outfit that showed this amount of skin. She had gone for a white and black chequered miniskirt, black turtleneck, and thick, black platform boots that contrasted beautifully against the strip of skin visible between where her skirt ended and her boots began. Her hair was fairly normal, and not styled in a classic 60s beehive or bouffant. Instead she had chosen to keep it shoulder length and straight, with only the ends curling outwards slightly. Half of it was pulled back into a neat bun and feathered bangs framed her face, drawing attention to the eyeliner she had used to emphasise just how pretty her dark eyes were.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      The Bitch.
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Morning sweetheart,” Rio murmured, drawing closer to gently tug on one of the tight curls by her ear, causing it to spring down and then bounce up, falling out of position.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whilst Swatting Rio’s hand away Agatha scowled at her, only just managing to rectify her expression into one of neighbourly warmth the moment Wanda joined them back by her garden gate.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rita!” Wanda cried in friendly greeting, “how lovely to see you again”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled at Wanda, a lazy smirk as she looked the other woman up and down, “Wanda,” was the extend of Rio’s greeting, yet by the way Wanda smiled and blushed, it had apparently been enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having had quite enough of
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     , Agatha grabbed Wanda’s wrist and wrapped it around her own arm, intending on dragging her to Dottie’s soiree before Rio could beg herself an invite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet her efforts were, of course, in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda for one refused to be dragged, instead she turned back to face Rio who was still standing on the sidewalk outside Wanda’s home, picking the leaves from her front hedge, only to rip them up into small pieces and throw them over the street and the two women now stood in front of her like confetti.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rita?” Wanda’s voice was politely perplexed. It was obvious she was not entirely comfortable around someone as strange as Rio, yet she was still being driven by her moral compass, which would not allow her to exclude Rio from a gathering with the other woman of Westview. “Would you care to join us for lunch? Dottie is having a bit of a get together before the neighbourhood talent show later today”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned another one of her sharp, wolfish smiles as she slipped forward like the wraith she was to drag Agatha’s other arm over her own, clamping it close to her waist as she nodded, “I have some time to kill”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well then, it was meant to be!” Wanda commented happily before beginning to lead the three of them, who were now all linked by their arms, down the road, babbling all the while.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha however, was struggling to take in a single word the other woman was saying, as Rio had brought her free hand up and started to gently brush the tips of her fingers over the skin of Agatha’s forearm, a distracting caress that she knew, Rio knew, would drive her insane.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately, it didn’t take them long to get to Dottie’s house which was only one street over from their own, where Agatha was quick to wriggle free from both of the arms wrapped around her own. She managed as well, to dodge Rio’s last minute attempt to drag her back towards herself with a well-timed sneeze in the other direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Smirking, she watched as Rio’s frustration at Agatha’s slipperiness descended over her face. Rio was not the only one who knew what made the other tick after all, and Rio was always so beautifully riled by the prospect of a chase.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dottie spotted the trio approaching her house and was quick to wave them around the back where the other women had gathered, offering them drinks as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha introduced Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda then introduced Rio, as Agatha was pretending Rio didn’t exist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately, Wanda had taken it in her stride the moment all the other ladies of Westview stared at Rio as though she was a stranger, which she was. Agatha was surprised Rio not knowing the neighbours hadn’t planted a big red flag in Wanda’s mind, yet alas, she seemed more concerned with magic shows and keeping the world in shades of grey than putting massively obvious clues together.
    </p>
    <p>
     From their introduction it was immediately clear that the gaggle of other women found Rio a perplexing puzzle of a person. Some of them frowned at the amount of leg she had on show, other’s ogled with confused appreciation. All of them reared back when she smiled at them in that mad way, with her eyes wide and eerily vacant, but then immediately leaned back in, evidently charmed and intrigued by this unusual, attractive stranger who had come for tea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha found herself relying on the large selection of alcoholic drinks Dottie had lined up to get her through the entire event. She spent the soiree entertaining herself with a glib comment here or an unnecessarily graphic description of her fake husband’s ass there. She liked the way they would all bristle and clutch their pearls prudishly. Plus, it had the additional benefit of causing that crazed glint to appear in Rio’s eyes, a look that always made Agatha's blood heat up, even if she refused to admit such things out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was, surprisingly, all going rather well. Shockingly Rio had done little more than eat an entire bowl of olives, pips and all, whilst glaring at Agatha when it all suddenly went off piste again.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the ladies had introduced the topic of husbands, bemoaning the fact her own spent all of his time either working or at the bar with his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dottie had then commented on her own marriage and from there had been a domino-line of women airing their relationship grievances. Until it reached Wanda at least, who was so sickeningly in love it made Agatha want to retch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, well…” Wanda stuttered the moment everyone’s eyes settled on her, their gazes expectant and demanding she join their ranks of feminine fury, “Vision is a wonderful husband, he takes good care of me and I love him very much”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha would have been sick and she very nearly was, if not for Wanda distracting her by throwing her under the microscope instead, “how about Ralph, Agnes? Any complaints?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately, Agatha who spent a lot of her time making up bizarre stories about her fake husband for her own amusement, was quick to ad lib, “there are many,
     <i>
      many
     </i>
     things wrong with Ralph, one being he just cannot keep up with me you know…” she lowered her voice, eager to scandalise the other ladies, “…in the
     <i>
      bedroom
     </i>
     . I guess I'm just too much woman for him".
    </p>
    <p>
     They all tittered and gasped, each of them absolutely scandalised at her crude answer. Yet it was Rio who was the first to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wrong person for you then isn’t it,
     <i>
      Agnes
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes narrowed sharply in Rio’s direction, “not at all,
     <i>
      Rita
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk was as attractive as it was bold and Agatha immediately regretted even bringing up the bedroom, joking or otherwise, for she knew instantly that Rio, who didn’t know what a verbal filter was let alone possessed one, was about to say something highly flammable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If Ralph can’t keep up with you then he isn’t right for you. You should be with someone who satisfies you, someone who knows how to tire you out”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bristled where she sat, finding herself to suddenly be the scandalised pearl-clutcher as she raised a nervous hand to twiddle with the collar of her dress. She forced a polite smile onto her face as she glanced around at the other women, taking in their affronted expressions before turning to glare at Rio again, who was now leaning back with her arms stretched out behind her, one leg crossed over the other looking far too good in that minskirt and far,
     <i>
      far
     </i>
     too pleased with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, Agatha knew exactly what petty button to press.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wouldn’t know what that’s like hon,” she chuckled loudly, embracing Agnes’s well-known habit of sharing far too much information, “never had the luck of being with someone who tires me out. Must be nice”.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the other women had fallen silent at the tense exchange taking place between their nosy neighbour and the distractingly good-looking stranger they had just met. Their eyes dragged towards Rio following Agatha's statement, awaiting her reply as though they were watching a tennis match in slow motion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched with satisfaction as the rage flared behind Rio’s eyes at her pointed words. They both knew that what she had said wasn’t true, like at all. It was a big fat lie but saying it out loud pissed Rio off and that had been her goal. She felt her breath still in her throat whilst watching Rio gear up for what was undoubtedly going to be an acidic response, yet once again Wanda and her desperate need to stay on scripted schedule saved Agatha from an explosive confrontation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh gosh, look at the time! We better hurry ladies or we will be late for the magic show!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Golly-gee Wanda, lets motor,” Agatha replied, voice filled with overly concerned pep. She managed as well to shoot a smirk at Rio, whose hands had clenched into furious fists at having her opportunity to reply shorn short.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha would have counted it as a win, if Rio hadn’t of brought one long finger up against her own throat to drag it sideways. She knew then that this squabble of theirs was far from over.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXX
    </p>
    <p>
     The magic show would have been utterly boring and predictable if it wasn’t such a good opportunity to cast the odd chaos-inducing spell. Agatha was quick with her fingers, swirling her purple fire under the table, eager to cause their pully system to malfunction or for Vision to draw the wrong card.
    </p>
    <p>
     Señor Scratchy really had been the true star of the show and the moment he jumped off stage, prompted by the chaos of Wanda and Vision's act going wrong, Agatha slipped backstage, keen to ensure her familiar was safe and content.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she was hidden amongst the curtains though, studying the ground to spot a tuft of white fur, she felt strong fingers grip her wrist and tug her into another curl of curtain that then wrapped around them tightly, pulling Agatha against her captor and sheltering the pair of them from prying eyes, as if someone had charmed the drapes to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hand on her wrist slid to her waist as another curled around her throat, tightening slightly as Rio drew their faces close together, close enough that the flutter of exhales could be felt on lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gasped, surprised to find herself so quickly wrapped up with her ex.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked at her, dipping her thumb into the hollow of her throat to graze over the small patch of skin she had marked the other week, now healed and unblemished, “you sure were mouthier with everyone else around. What’s wrong Agatha? Lost your tongue?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She was using that sweet voice, the light tone that meant she was furious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked up at her, unwilling to give an inch or be intimidated by anyone, even if it was her furious ex-wife who was also the human incarnation of Death.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What’s wrong Vidal? Bruised ego?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She choked on her gasp when Rio pulled her closer still, trying desperately not to enjoy the sensation of Rio's hands all over her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We both know what you said earlier was a lie. Or has it been too long, and you need me to remind you of how it used to be?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha attempted to wriggle free, but the spell Rio had cast on the curtains, which had since wrapped around their legs too, held them together in their own small bubble of secrecy. She felt her pulse drop into the depths of her stomach, suddenly finding herself unable to stop staring down at Rio’s mouth, which was hovering just over her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her flustered state spurred Rio on, who drew so close Agatha felt their lips brush when she spoke, “do you want me to remind you of how I used to make you feel? How I can
     <i>
      still
     </i>
     make you feel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her temper flare then, suddenly feeling exceptionally angry at herself for feeling weak in the face of temptation and at Rio for tempting her in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck you,” she spat, allowing her mouth to brush Rio’s, intent on claiming some of that control they were always wrestling over for herself, and feeling a simmer of pleasure the moment she heard Rio’s breath catch in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Name the place and time, sweetheart”.
    </p>
    <p>
     They both stilled then, simply staring at one another with chests heaving and tension mounting, until the sound of the crowd applauding the finale of the magic show jolted Agatha back to reality.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waving her own hand until purple flames crackled over her palm, she swirled her wrist causing the curtains to loosen and uncurl from around their entwined figures.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Rita
     </i>
     ,” she quipped, petting her ruffled hair down with both hands to ensure it didn’t look like Agnes had been two seconds away from being ravished inside a curtain, “you know I’m a married woman”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio arched an eyebrow, looking disturbingly pleased with herself all of a sudden. Agatha felt her stomach plummet.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course I know that, you’re still
     <i>
      my
     </i>
     wife after all”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could tell shock had enveloped her previously smug expression, which was not a feeling she enjoyed experiencing. After all, not a lot could shock a 350 year old witch, yet that particular statement had stolen the breath from her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? No I’m not. Not
     <i>
      anymore
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin was back in place, looking far too much like a shark cornering a flounder, “you sure are sweetheart. I never actually signed anything so…”
    </p>
    <p>
     She shrugged flippantly, as though she hadn’t just fundamentally changed Agatha’s understanding of her own life.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You didn’t sign the… oh for
     <i>
      fuck sake
     </i>
     !” Agatha roared, causing the crowd outside to fall silent for a short moment before the babble of uncertain conversation carried on at a quiet murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leant forward and pecked her on the cheek, “I think you should move home my love, this estrangement of ours has gone on for far too long, we both know it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned to leave and whilst gathering the curtain to do so, said over her shoulder, “plus, we all know Ralph can’t satisfy you,” she smirked, “if
     <i>
      he
     </i>
     even can”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hissed at her, unable to think of anything else to say whilst having her sexuality called out so blatantly. She also thought it was an excellent way to communicate her opinion on their current marital status. Although her response was cut short when Rio left their semi-structured curtain tent, as it flopped over the moment the spell ended, landing on her head and encasing her in the thick fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wonderful,” she seethed from beneath it, allowing it to cover her and lacking the energy to remove it, “fucking
     <i>
      wonderful
     </i>
     ”.

     Agatha knew the moment Westview had been redecorated again, because the moment she opened her eyes, she was blinded by the depth and variety of colours suddenly surrounding her; all manner of blues, greens, yellows,
     <i>
      purple
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda had evidently reinvented the wheel and introduced colour back into their world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t say she was disappointed with the change.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hopped out of bed with a level of energy she usually lacked before nine in the morning, yet the golden sunlight streaming through the window was causing a shimmering rainbow of sporadic light to reflect off the white wall opposite her bed, filling Agatha with a healthy dose of vitality and an uncharacteristic amount of morning pep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her wardrobe was open with an outfit hanging on the outside of the door, so she took the hint that this was to be her new costume and pulled it down, as Wanda's spell was many things, but subtle was not one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The outfit turned out to be a white undershirt with a wide collar, designed to be worn under a form fitting navy dress with a patterned skirt. It wasn’t the most stylish of outfits, but she would take it over the restrictive, heavier materials of the past two decades.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not to mention, her hair was finally long again, as she preferred it, back to its rich, full length with only a few feathered sections styled around her face to give it that 70s edge. Giddy relief filled her as she ran her fingers through it, ruffling and messing it up just for the sheer joyous freedom of the act.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck did it feel nice not to have a whole can of hairspray on her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     She dressed quickly, slipping her feet into the pair of leather brogues that had been charmed to appear by her bedroom door, before wandering down the stairs for breakfast. Agatha grabbed a grapefruit from the fruit bowl, sliced it in two and started to scoop out the fruit with a spoon directly into her mouth, forgoing the need for a bowl. As she ate her breakfast, she peered out her front window, curious to see if there had been any major changes to the geography of the street following Wanda's latest update.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly a face appeared on the other side of the glass, eyes wide and grinning madly. Agatha screamed and jerked backwards, managing to fling the entire grapefruit over her head to splatter on the wooden floor behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You asshole!” Agatha roared, slapping her hand against the glass right in front of Rio’s face, who was now snickering in amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     In response Rio pressed her face and palms closer against the glass, causing her nose to squish upwards and her lower lip to drag down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me in”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Erm let me think about that for a moment…” Agatha placed a finger to her chin, pretending to ponder the question, “no”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on,” Rio was using that low, teasing tone now. It was a dangerous one, one that had always gotten under Agatha’s skin and made it very hard not to do whatever it was Rio wanted her to, “let me in, you know you want to”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, trying to hide the way Rio’s imploring voice made her pulse quicken, “why would I want to do that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because I haven’t seen the blue of your eyes for over a century and I deserve that much after what you did”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The painful truth of Rio’s words was in opposition to her casual actions, which was to lean forward again, breath heavily against the cool glass to fog it up, and then draw a large heart with her fingertip in the condensation.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ease in which Rio stated something so painful was the only reason Agatha eventually sighed and opened the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Rio had spat it out of spite or in the heat of an argument, Agatha would have been able to gather enough petty fury to at least pretend she was revelling in Rio’s pain. Yet Rio had said it so easily, so factually that it had struck Agatha silent for a short moment. It was such a beautiful, melancholic sentence, so grief filled and simple, it caused Agatha’s heart to pound painfully beneath her ribs, demanding she remember its existence and the way it still yearned so desperately for the woman asking to be let inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio skulked through the front door, brushing unnecessarily close to Agatha’s front as she slipped passed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who was still feeling rather unsettled following Rio's words, shut the door quietly after her. Once closed, she turned to lean against it, giving herself a moment to study Rio in her updated clothing, taking in the beautiful vision she made in full technicolour.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s outfit, much like Agatha's own, had also changed with the times. It now consisted of flared bellbottom jeans and a white Fleetwood Mac t-shirt that she had tucked into her trousers. Her hair was longer in this era too, although it had been styled in a way that reflected Rio's laid-back approach to 70s fashion, having been deeply textured and layered, giving it a shaggy, relaxed look that suited her lazy smirk a bit too well.
    </p>
    <p>
     The green witch allowed Agatha a moment to take her in before swooping closer, caging her against the door. Rio didn’t reach out to touch her, instead she simply stared, dragging her eyes from Agatha’s black brogues, up her navy, patterned dress. For a short moment, those dark eyes halted on her lips, pausing a moment to consider them as Rio dragged her own lip between her teeth, before continuing their journey up to capture Agatha’s gaze with her own, where they finally settled and stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So blue they’re almost grey. Just like the ocean after a storm,” Rio murmured, nodding to herself as she drew a hand up to hold Agatha’s chin in place. It felt as though she was trying to reassure herself that she had remembered them correctly, that she hadn't forgotten the exact shade of her eyes after all these years apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath shuddered out from between parted lips, and she felt tears start to pool in the eyes Rio was still intent on studying.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was the damning reality of her love for Rio, it always had been, for as long as she could remember.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Agatha loved every aspect of this frustrating, dangerous woman and she always had. She loved every side, every version, every iteration. Many of Rio’s faces frustrated her, many of her layers weakened her, yet when Rio was tender, when she was sweet and her words were poetry whispered softly against her skin, it destroyed her, her and every other defence Agatha had managed to construct between her heart and Rio's.
    </p>
    <p>
     A single tear slipped free, trailing over the curve of her cheek. Rio raised her other hand and gently wiped it away with her thumb, before settling her palm against the side of Agatha’s jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unable to resist the vulnerability she could feel bleeding into every place Rio's body touched her own, she reached up with shaky hands to softly clasp the other woman’s face. Then without prior thought or calculation, she allowed her body to take control and gently tugged Rio's face down so she could press her lips against Rio’s forehead, causing both of them to exhale heavily the moment soft lips met warm skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt Rio shudder before practically sagging against her. Within moments, she had buried her face in the slither of space that existed between Agatha’s shoulder and jaw. Unable to resist providing the comfort Rio's body was screaming out for, Agatha wrapped both her arms around her shoulders and tugged her closer with an arm around her waist and a hand gently cradling the back of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pair of them remained like that for several still silent minutes, where they were both breathing deeply and in sync, until Rio drew back slightly, only far enough away to murmur a single word.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agatha
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a word exhaled in a single breath. A word wrapped in pleading and disguising a cavern of agony with simple desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha drew back, guiding Rio’s face away from her throat with gentle hands so she could see her expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     She found herself staring then, as she absorbed the depth of colour in Rio’s eyes too. A deep brown shining almost golden in the sunlight pouring through the window, like whiskey on a summer’s day.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were Agatha's favourite colour. Above all others, including purple; not that she would ever admit to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could sense her resolve weakening quickly as her desire to remain away from Rio unravelled like a caught thread from a spool. Within moments of the realisation, her control snapped and she felt herself leaning in, as she drew Rio’s face closer to her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, for a second time that morning, a loud bang outside jolted Agatha back to reality.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jerking back, Agatha felt the walls Rio had managed to scale in an embarrassingly short amount of time, shoot back into place to quickly surround her heart and cover that old, bruised muscle with barbed wire and rusty spikes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flushing, she chuckled hollowly and slipped out from between the wall and Rio's body, removing her hands from Rio’s face as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the hell was that?” she asked loudly, just for the sake of breaking the tension that had crept in between them, like toxic fog hovering ominously around their ankles, eager to choke her after a single slip up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio remained where she was for a few short moments, facing the wall with her fists clenched, eyes closed, and breathing deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No idea,” Rio finally muttered, her voice deadpan and toneless. She stalked towards the window and twitched the net curtain away from the glass. Her frustration with the interruption was apparent in the way her fingers kept twitching towards her knife. An old habit that Agatha used to sooth with the gentle brush of fingertips against the back of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio peered outside for a few moments before raising a finger to point down the street, “ah, its our new best friend. Somethings changed”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha approached slowly, ensuring there was still plenty of space between Rio and herself. She was not ready to be in such close proximity to the green witch again, especially with the desire to reach out and touch her still thrumming just below the surface of her skin. It felt painful, like every cell in her body was leaning towards Rio, each one reduced to nothing more than a desperate flower searching for the heat of Rio's light.
    </p>
    <p>
     She peeked out as well and immediately noticed the aura of power shimmering over Wanda’s house. It was an iridescent scene, very similar to how heat looked simmering over concrete. Occasionally a flare or crackle of scarlet power would flash past a downstairs window or up the chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Huh,” Agatha said whilst arching a curious eyebrow, “I had better get a closer look”.
    </p>
    <p>
     In an attempt to do so without notice, Agatha glanced sideways to get a reading of the other woman's expression, yet she soon realised Rio had stopped looking outside, and had instead been staring at Agatha's profile with dark, possessive eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eager to remove the heat she could still feel pulsing between them, that same heat that crackled violently the moment her gaze met Rio's, Agatha quipped, “you know where the door is yes? Show yourself out”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And with that she fled her own home, desperate as she was to put as much space between herself and the green witch as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXX
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda was pregnant.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or at least she had convinced herself she was and her body was acting as such, with expanding stomach and all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether there was an actual baby in her womb though, who could say? This entire town was being fuelled by chaos magic and the pregnancy was progressing too quickly for it to be natural. No, it was just another branch of insanity on Wanda’s crazy tree; managing to convince herself she was pregnant with a dead man’s child.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck her, if it didn't hurt though. The reminder of him, of who she had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
     As it always did, Agatha's pain quickly turned to spite and she found herself leaving a few obvious clues for Vision. She was more eager now than ever for him to realise the truth of their current reality; that his wife was holding an entire town hostage, that he was dead, that their child didn’t even exist, that Wanda was the true villain of this show.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha charmed Herb, leaving him a paused glitch in the background of this damn sitcom. Then just to add acid to a burn she had already created, she made sure Vision saw herself and Herb whispering together, intent on heightening the Synthezoid man's paranoia regarding the things around him that just didn’t add up.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she made her way home, she felt her fingers tightening on the bike handles. That old familiar pressure was building beneath her skin again, that burning desire to drain the energy from something, to destroy something, to take something from someone else because something precious had been taken from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She left her bike propped against the front of her house, before storming inside and slamming the door behind her. A cry of fury erupted from between bared teeth as she turned to sweep the tall lamp from beside the front door to the ground, relishing in the violent sound of glass smashing across the hardwood floor the moment it shattered around her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     In an instant, all of that desperate rage drained from her veins like a dam bursting a leak, leaving Agatha with nothing but the anguish that had fuelled the outburst. Slowly she slid to the floor, leaning up against the door with her arms wrapped around her knees and her head buried in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     She never sobbed. She didn’t allow herself to, yet she felt closer to doing so than she had in a long, long time.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was as she was attempting to force ragged drags of air down her throat in a desperate attempt to stop the tears from spilling and drowning her completely, that she felt the warmth of another body beside her own and the weight of two arms wrapping around her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     What little strength had been holding her up evaporated the moment she felt Rio’s body supporting her own and she quickly collapsed sideways, burying her face in Rio’s throat, the positioning now a complete reversal of their embrace from that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt Rio’s arms tighten around her so she could haul Agatha closer. One of her hands remained wrapped around Agatha's shoulders, whilst the others guided her legs sideways over Rio's own, so she was practically cradling Agatha to her chest, creating a safe place for her to fall apart in, to allow the inundation of pain to overtake her completely whilst secure in the knowledge that she wouldn’t be swept away forever, that she wouldn't drown in the agony of it all. For her anchor was here, holding her tight, holding her safe.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda, she…” Agatha stuttered, finding it hard to think the words, let alone say them out loud, “she’s pregnant, she’s going to have a baby”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt Rio sigh beneath her, a heavy knowing sound.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was clear then that Rio hadn't been aware of what had upset her so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her heart contract painfully at that realisation. For not only had Rio's first instinct been to simply hold her, even whilst entirely in the dark as to what had caused her distress, but she also can't have left Agatha's house today. She had been sat here waiting all day, refusing to leave, as she knew the magical defences Agatha had installed around her house wouldn’t let her back in if she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     This woman. This frustrating, ancient, wonderful woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha recognised too the moment Rio pieced together exactly why Agatha was so distraught, for her arms tightened and her breathing became as ragged as Agatha’s own, an uneasy breath through parted lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Agatha had been alone she would have managed to hold herself together with some well practiced breathing techniques. But here, in the arms of the woman she still loved so dearly, in the arms of the only other person who loved Nicholas in the same furious way Agatha did, it was impossible not to crack, to not to release a whimper that quickly mutated into a strangled sob.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gates burst then and she was soon sobbing, properly, in a way she hadn’t since Rio had been forced to take that small bundle from her arms and carry him away as silent tears poured down her beautiful face; a mothers grief muted by the suffocating shackles of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pressed a hand to her own chest, trying to calm the frantic pounding of her heart, certain the muscle couldn’t take this level of grief, this depth of pain for much longer. Rio’s hand was quick to find hers, cupping her own over Agatha's, pressing them both gently against her chest, bracketing it, supporting it with a warm palm and a tender touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It hurts, it
     <i>
      still
     </i>
     hurts so badly, it never stops hurting,” Agatha whispered, eyes clenched tightly to ward off errant thoughts and shadow-like memories of whispered babbling coming from a phantom cot.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know sweetheart,” was all Rio said in reply, her voice wet with desperate grief as she tightened her arms around Agatha’s body, “I know”.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXX
    </p>
    <p>
     They stayed in the same spot for over an hour, long after the sun had tipped beyond the horizon and the streetlights had flickered on outside, leaving their tangled embrace shrouded in the dark shadows of the long hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
     A metaphor for their current relationship if Agatha had ever heard one.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was strange, because as much history and hurt as there was that existed between them, they were still, agonisingly, each other's safest place. It made Agatha's head spin, the weight of their relationship and all of the ways they were tangled together, the depths of the roots they each had in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eventually though, her brain felt tired of those confusing, spinning thoughts and her body felt painfully stiff from sitting on the floor for such a long time. Refusing to stretch her muscles wasn’t going to change the past after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My ass has gone numb,” were the first words Agatha mumbled, lifting her chin up slightly to glance at Rio, who was still leaning back against the wall cradling Agatha close. Rio's head was tilted back with her eyes closed, giving Agatha a wonderfully divine view of her long throat and sharp jawline.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio remained still aside from a single hand, which slipped from holding Agatha’s waist to grab a handful of her ass, “want me to rub it better for you darling?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scowled for it would appear that the tender moment they had been sharing was over. Rio smirked at Agatha's reaction and dug her fingers in to dimple the flesh of her rear greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha yelped in surprise, causing Rio’s smile to transition from a smirk into a grin as sharp as the knife she favoured.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me up you creature,” Agatha swatted at both of Rio’s hands which suddenly felt like they had multiplied and were taking the opportunity to revisit their old favourite places to grasp and grab, as the one on her ass swept up to palm the curve of her hip and the other started to run down the length of her thigh at a decadently slow pace.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But you feel so good,” Rio complained, pouting slightly as she hauled her closer again, reducing what little space Agatha had managed to claw back between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     She scoffed, “what are you? Part octopus? Hands off".
    </p>
    <p>
     She flicked her hands at Rio’s, shooting two short darts of purple into the other woman's flesh, making Rio hiss from the gentle burn of her magic and drop the hold she had on Agatha’s body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was quick to scrabble to her feet, groaning slightly at the ache in her lower back when her spine straightened out. Rio didn’t stand, instead she slipped further down the wall until her entire body was laid flat out on the floor aside from her head and shoulders, which were still propped up against the skirting board.
    </p>
    <p>
     Refusing to let Rio's childish antics soften her resolve further, Agatha pointed at the front door, “it’s late. Go home”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scowled and pulled the knife from her belt. She fiddled with it petulantly for a few moments, entirely ignoring Agatha's orders before jabbing the tip of her blade into the wooden floorboard beside her own body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go on,” Agatha kicked gently at Rio’s limp thigh, “I have a horrendous seventies recipe to follow and you need to… to go do whatever it is you do with your free time. Haunt children, hang out in graveyards, you know the usual”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Huffing, Rio finally dragged herself to her feet, using the knife sticking out of the floorboards as a brace point. Once standing, she pulled the blade free and sheathed it in a well practiced fluid motion. Her eyes rolled heavily at Agatha's stern expression, but they caught in place the moment she glanced over Agatha’s shoulder towards the kitchen, “an awful seventies recipe?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked, aware Rio was probably the only other person she knew who would enjoy the puckish nature of her evening plans, “yep. It’s a cottage cheese, gelatine, and corned beef consommé. I found an era-appropriate recipe book in the kitchen, and I make sure to cook a delicious meal for my husband Ralph every evening, he can't get enough of them".
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyebrow arched sharply at Agatha referring to her fake husband in front of her very real wife, yet for once, she chose not to comment on Agatha's pointed choice of words. Instead her smirk ticked up as her eyes sparkled in that familiarly mischievous way. It was a look Agatha had always found irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I help you make it? After all, I think it's about time I met this so called
     <i>
      husband
     </i>
     of yours”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s immediate reaction was to deny the request, to shake her head and insist Rio leave Agatha to feeding her fake husband terrible food by herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet the tired glint in Rio's expression led Agatha quickly to a realisation, an important one. She understood then that Rio was also reeling heavily following the emotional exorcism they had shared that afternoon. That the grief they exposed to one another was as big a moment in Rio's life as it had been in Agatha’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio asking to help was her asking to stay. It was Rio pleading, in her own way, for support, for company. And after she had held Agatha so tightly, so well, and for so long. Well, she might be a morally questionable witch with a devious hunger for power, but she wasn’t a total monster.
    </p>
    <p>
     So instead of shaking her head and pushing Rio towards the door, she held a hand out and nodded her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, sure you can help me. I’ll tell Ralph you are my gal pal from down the road”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s responding smile was entirely worth a few sacrificed bricks from Agatha's emotional walls, it was her soft smile after all, the gentle one she rarely allowed to slip over her beautiful face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Careful Agatha, people might talk,” was Rio's glib reply, belying the relief Agatha could see clearly in the way her shoulders relaxed. Quickly, as though afraid Agatha was going to snatch her hand away again, she grasped the offered hand tightly with her own, linking their fingers together just like they used to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked, “aah hell, let them talk. Rumours are ghosts of the truth after all? Isn't that what they say?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she tightened her grip on Rio’s hand and dragged her to the kitchen.

     Things had been strange since the 1970s dissolved around them, having been promptly replaced by the neon colours and block patterns of the 1980s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Strange in the sense that ever since that particular afternoon in her shadowy hallway, her dynamic with Rio seemed to fluctuate between moments of gentle tenderness to instances of furious resentment. As for all the moments encompassed in the grey between those grand sentiments, well they both gained far too much pleasure from irritating the other, like children on the playground pulling pigtails.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, Agatha refused to let Rio’s presence distract her from the mission at hand, so she continued to play the role of “nosy neighbour” as successfully as any Broadway star might have.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda had given birth to twins, or at least two babies had appeared in her house. Whether she had actually given birth was still up for debate. Although, the way Agatha saw it, whether the babies were a figment of Wanda’s curse or real-life human children, it made no difference to the screaming racket they made at all hours of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their crying had woken her that morning in fact, around 5am, which was an ungodly, cursed hour. Agatha had rolled over and glared from her nest of pillows and blankets at the bedroom window, where early morning sunlight and the screaming cries of demanding babies were drifting through the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having had enough, she pulled on the spandex outfit Wanda’s enchantment had crafted for her and ensured her permed curls, which she admittedly loved, were falling just right around her face and shoulders. She then shoved some food in her mouth, brushed her teeth, and grabbed her bag before heading across the street to Wanda’s house.
    </p>
    <p>
     As it had been charmed to do, Wanda’s front door swung open the moment she stepped up to the threshold. Within moments, the audience laugh track played alongside her very own cheesy theme tune as "Agnes" made her big entrance. Inside the house, she came upon a scripted scene that both Wanda and Vision were in the middle of acting out together, which consisted of them bickering over the best way to soothe their restless twins.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hiya kids!” Agatha said brightly, pausing for a short moment to bask in the applause, even if it was fake and the result of a spell.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agnes!” Wanda replied cheerily, turning from the two cots she had been worrying over to say hello to her neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was just on my way to jazzercize, when I heard your two little bundles of joy on a sleep strike!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Vision stepped forward, “oh, who told you that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned to him with a sassy hand on a sassy hip, “er, my ears!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly another theme tune started to play, as the front door swung open again and the fake audience started to cheer loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a different melody to the one Wanda’s enchantment had composed for “Agnes”. It was more heavily reminiscent of a slow electric guitar solo, a cool, untouchable song that indicated a fan-favourite had just entered the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course it made sense that Wanda’s magic had written Rio into the show, having been unable to source her origins or remove her, it had chosen instead to simply incorporate her. Evidently, if her outfit was anything to go by, as the sexy rebel archetype that had been crafted into legend by the cinematic ventures of the 1980s.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was, of course, Rio at the door, who was now donning fitted high-waisted jeans, a simple black vest tucked into the waistband of her trousers, an oversized denim jacket and aviators. Her dark hair was still long, although it had transformed from the feathered cut favoured in the 70s into the well-known tousled layers of the 1980s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Put simply, Rio looked good.
     <i>
      Really
     </i>
     good.
     <i>
      Frustratingly
     </i>
     good.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rita!” Wanda greeted in the same cheerful voice she had welcomed Agatha a few moments earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s responding smile was sharp, although her eyes were still hidden behind the dark lenses of her sunglasses.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda,” she said in cool greeting before turning towards Vision, “Vision,” she added politely. Finally, Rio’s head tilted and her gaze landed on Agatha. She raised a hand to lower her sunglasses until they were resting just below the bridge of her nose, allowing her dark eyes to peer over the top of the lenses and graze a hot trail up Agatha’s spandex covered figure.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a scorching second, Rio murmured her final greeting, “Agnes”. Her voice had dropped in pitch and was loaded, heady with tension and heavy with hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t often get embarrassed; she considered herself far too old for such inane reactions. Yet, Rio looking at her like
     <i>
      that,
     </i>
     talking to her like
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     , in front of Wanda and Vision no less, caused a hot blush to rise up her throat and along her cheekbones until even the tips of her ears were bright pink.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Rita
     </i>
     ,” Agatha squeezed through gritted teeth, her forced smile doing a terrible job of disguising a frustrated grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a few steps closer to her and pulled the aviators from her face with a dangerous smirk, “did you miss me, baby?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gaped at Rio's boldness and felt her flush darken. Distantly, she heard Vision cough to cover a shocked laugh and was suddenly hideously aware of their audience. She peered sideways to take note of Wanda and Vision’s reaction, only to immediately notice the way one of Wanda’s eyebrows arched as she and Vision exchanged a curious glance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eager to tame this fire before it burned her, Agatha laughed loudly, obnoxiously so, before slapping a hand on her hip again, “
     <i>
      baby
     </i>
     ? Oh Rita, aren’t you just a riot? The only babies I see are these two little miracles”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stepped forward to peer into the crib closest to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     On glancing in, she noticed the name “Billy” stitched onto his green blanket. Unable to resist the maternal urge that suddenly consumed her, she gently traced the tips of her fingers over the soft skin of his little hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Baby Billy, who had been crying this entire time, paused to sniffle slightly before turning his hand over to grip one of her fingers with his small fist. He then immediately started crying again, even with Agatha caught in his tiny clutches.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly, Agatha felt her damaged heart crack and her throat tighten. Nicholas had always done the same when he had been small, taking any opportunity to grip one of her fingers in his much smaller ones, taking comfort from the presence of his mother, even whilst being too young to even realise he was doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her sudden stillness caused the others in the room to pause too, exposing each of them to a stiflingly awkward atmosphere the instant Agatha’s charismatic energy evaporated from the room, leaving only a parent’s silent grief in its wake.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda exchanged another loaded look with Vision before stepping forward to brush a gentle palm against Agatha’s shoulder, “Agnes? Are you alright?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately, Rio, who was the only other person in the room who knew the precise reason Agatha had been reduced to a statue of stilted pain, stepped closer and wrapped a tight arm around Agatha’s waist, hauling her tightly into her side, “she’s fine, aren’t you baby?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s possessive touch broke Agatha out of her trance, as her insistence on using romantic terms of endearment, even in company, caused a frustrated scowl to break out on Agatha's face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio squeezed her waist again, a hint that she should at least pretend to be normal.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, sorry!” she laughed awkwardly, all the while trying to wriggle out of Rio’s firm grasp, “I just adore babies and seeing these two little bundles of sweetness so upset, well it upsets me too, you know”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She forced another chuckle, as she finally managed to dislodge Rio’s hand from her hip. Then, in a quick attempt at distracting Wanda and Vision from the scene Rio was insisting on making, she threw her bag on the couch to search for the lavender relaxation potion she had brewed yesterday evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Peering up whilst hunting through the depths of her bag, she grinned at Wanda, “fussy babies! We dare you to stay awake!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda and Vision stepped to the side then and started to have a bit of a to-do, trading hushed whispered back and forth, each of them cringing at every loud, piercing cry their children were taking turns to emit.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was making Agatha's head pound painfully too, so the moment she felt the glass bottle of her relaxation potion in her palm, she pulled it from the depths of her bag and started to spray the sweet-smelling concoction just above their cribs, eager for the natural aroma of lavender to soothe them enough to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had always worked a treat for Nicky, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment they realised Agatha was spritzing something at their children though, Vision looked over with a concerned expression on his face, “oh?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lavender!” She told him loudly, “it’s supposed to have a calming effect. Ralph sprays it on me every night, but there’s no taming this tiger!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Vision flushed bright red at her words, however her glee at his discomfort was cut short the moment she felt a firm palm slap her ass, “who would want to tame you? That’s criminal”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s voice was confident, with not an ounce of shame at being so outrageously flirtatious amongst company.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha immediately yelped and jumped away from Rio, as she once again started to flush heavily. She covered her embarrassment by quickly pointing towards the kitchen, all the while trying to ignore the perplexed expressions on both Wanda and Vision’s faces, “I’m just going to… just going to look for, for the… the thing that I need. You know, the thing…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scurried to the kitchen, breathing deeply and trying to force the heat from her skin. In a bid to distract herself, she started searching through Wanda’s cupboards, hunting for their alcohol, whilst continuously grumbling quietly to herself about Rio and her consistently rising levels of sheer audacity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agnes,” Wanda’s voice was a hushed whisper, coming from just over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, having not heard Wanda follow after her, closed her eyes tightly before spinning around to face the other woman. She made sure her forcefully joyful smile was back in place as she said, “yes hon? I'm just looking for your dark liquor”. She slapped a dramatic hand against her chest the moment Wanda's eyes widened, “not for me, for the twins! What sort of babysitter do you think I am?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s surprised expression dropped back into one of troubled concern, like something beyond the false reality of her sitcom was bothering her, “Agnes… we’re friends, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s grin, if at all possible, got brighter, “of course we are hot stuff! Why? Is something wrong?”
    </p>
    <p>
     A sheepish look stole across Wanda’s face then, making her lips tug down slightly at the corners, “no, nothings wrong really, it’s just… may I ask you something? Something personal?”
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time throughout this interaction, Agatha felt uncertainty stir in her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her smile dimmed slightly, “er, sure hon, what’s on your mind?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s kind of awkward, but you and Rita… are you… is there something… have I split…” Wanda suddenly stopped herself from speaking. She glared down at the floor for a short moment whilst evidently gathering the courage to spit out her actual question. Then it came all at once, like she had to say it quickly in order to say it at all, “is there something going on between you and Rita?” Her voice got lower, a whisper, “something romantic?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could tell her face must have dropped in surprise because Wanda was quick to take a desperate step forward. She grasped Agatha’s hand, “it’s not a problem if there is, I swear! I just…”
    </p>
    <p>
     She frowned then, a look crafted from frustration and concern, “I am just worried that something might have come between the pair of you... something that I might be able to… to help you fix?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyebrows shot to her hairline as she processed Wanda’s words. This was the closest Wanda had ever come to breaking character and admitting that the world they were all living in was indeed a fallacy of her own creation. Wanda’s candidness surprised her, but it didn’t take Agatha long to piece it all together. Wanda was evidently concerned that Agatha and Rio had been in a relationship before her curse had swept through the town of Westview in a wave of scarlet, only for it to split them apart, pairing Agatha with a random man to make their presence more appropriate for a sitcom set in the 1950s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thinking quickly, Agatha lied, amending the truth to suit herself and make Rio look foolish, which was always a benefit in her opinion, “aah you caught wind of Rita's little crush, did you?” Agatha leaned closer, making her voice a whisper, “she has
     <i>
      always
     </i>
     had a bit of a thing for me, to be honest. She even asked me to junior prom, but I, of course, had to let her down easy. Bless her sweet, gentle, yearning heart”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A small wrinkle appeared between Wanda’s eyebrows as she stared back at Agatha intently. It was clear she was trying to puzzle out the truth of Agatha's words. Whether it was the actual truth, or whether it was her curse pushing a false narrative to keep a pair of lovers apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Evidently, Wanda was comfortable with hostage-taking and kidnap but drew the line at homophobia. Which honestly, Agatha respected. If anything it made the other witch more likable. But right now, in Agatha's current situation she did
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     need her relationship with Rio studied closely, especially by the witch who was still pulling all of the puppet strings.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You must have known her a long time if you went to high school together?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Taken aback by the question, Agatha paused as a stream of memories started to pass through her consciousness; the soft drag of woollen cloaks, husky laughter on frosty mornings, hot palms tracing the sensitive skin of her waist, the sound of a child's laughter echoing throughout a once happy home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, the ghosts of what had once been consumed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” she eventually breathed, unaware of how her eyes had softened whilst looking passed Wanda towards the door, towards Rio, “we have known each other practically our whole lives. She… she’s my best friend”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda, who had been witness to the flood of emotions encompassing Agatha's expression, looked suddenly distraught, “and something…
     <i>
      something
     </i>
     big came between you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Still lost to her past, Agatha nodded with distant, wet eyes, “something big did come between us, yeah”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you remember what that was... specifically?” Wanda’s voice was politely inquisitive. Lightly toned, which was in direct contrast to her actual question, as once again she was poking at things she probably shouldn’t be. It was immediately clear to Agatha that she was trying to uncover whether the “something” in question was her curse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unable to actually admit the truth without revealing herself, Agatha, in a snap decision, utilised the spell’s existence as a convenient excuse and simply smiled brightly again, “nope!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she turned and started to rifle through the next few cupboards, still intent on finding a bottle of alcohol, which she eventually did, tucked behind some old cans of tuna and tomato soup.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned with a whoop whilst holding the bottle aloft in victory, only to see Wanda’s eyes still studying her closely. The other witch looked sad and most worryingly of all, guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
     This plan had quite obviously backfired, as it was clear Wanda was now blaming herself for whatever rift she could sense between Rio and herself. Yet Agatha’s ability to explain, or even reassure the other witch that the "something" in question was entirely separate from the curse, had been muted.
    </p>
    <p>
     So with the intention of distracting Wanda from her complicated relationship with Rio, she strode forward with a broad grin and linked their arms together.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, lets go see if this helps that frustrating teething pain of theirs”.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, the moment the pair of them turned back into the living room, they were met with a scene that caused Agatha’s heart to melt and run molten through her veins, carrying the love that still burned so strongly for Rio around her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was sat on the sofa, leaning back into the cushions with her usual air of casual comfort, yet this time she had a twin in the cradle of each arm. For once, both babies looked settled and were babbling quietly to themselves, whilst staring up with innocent fascination at Rio’s face. Billy had even managed to wriggle a small arm free from his swaddle to grab a handful of Rio’s dark hair with his little fist. Rio, who didn’t appear to mind that a baby was now tugging on her hair, was simply staring back at them, eyes roving with simple awe from one chubby face to the next, then back again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t help the sound that left her then, a very quiet yet exceptionally heavy, “
     <i>
      oh
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was all so much; Rio holding babies, the babies finding her ancient presence a calming one, Rio being surprised,
     <i>
      again
     </i>
     , that an innocent life could take comfort at being held in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda was stood beside her with a gaze that flickered heavily between the two of them. She absorbed Agatha’s suddenly wrecked expression, before glancing at the gentle vision Rio made holding Wanda's son's close to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It doesn’t look like they are going to need this, after all,” Wanda's voice was soft as she pulled the slipping bottle of bourbon from Agatha’s slack grip. She then gave Agatha's shoulder a gentle nudge, pushing her towards Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha drifted closer to Rio without thought, like a ship heading home through a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked over the moment Agatha perched on the couch beside her, being sure to not disturb the now snoozing babies when she sat down next to the three of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her dark eyes were misty as they captured Agatha’s own, “hey,” was all she said in gentle greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” Agatha parroted quietly, her voice just as soft.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were both aware no further words were needed in this moment, that there was an unspoken understanding of who exactly they were both thinking of. Yet, for the first time the memory of their son didn't just instigate the drowning depths of their grief. For the presence of the new born twins reminded them both of the happiness they had shared as his mothers, of all the moments they had laughed together in this exact position, one of them cradling a baby and the other sat close by creating the ultimate image of an entwined pair connected through the love they had for one another, and the love they shared for their child.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled at her then, an expression as full of pain as it was disbelieving joy. She peered down at the young lives cradled in her arms, both of them snuggled comfortably into the crook of an elbow, before looking back up at Agatha with a hesitant glance, as if to say,
     <i>
      can you believe it
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her own eyes pooling then as she smiled back. Unable to resist the contact she knew they both desperately needed, Agatha lifted a hand to the back of Rio’s head and gently ran her fingers through her hair, before tracing her fingers over the side of her neck to cup Rio's jaw. Finally, Agatha nodded, intent on reassuring Rio that she could most certainly believe it. For Rio was many, many things, several of them bad, heaps of them questionable, but she had always been an exceptional mother who had loved their son fiercely, and he had loved her the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha would reduce anyone who said otherwise to ash.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, it looks like we finally found the cure to the boys tears,” Vision’s voice was a hushed whisper, almost reverent.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the sound of his voice breaking the silence, Agatha turned from Rio to look towards Wanda and Vision, who were stood together with their arms wrapped around the other, smiling softly at the image of their friends holding their boys.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda hummed softly, eyes glued to Agatha’s hand, which was still gently cradling Rio’s jaw, “a cure indeed…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she nodded to herself, as though determining a route forward through a problem only she was aware of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swallowed heavily, sure that Wanda was currently doing what any witch worth her salt would do with the clues she had managed to piece together; she was plotting.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha, Agatha was suddenly certain that her life in Wanda’s world was about to get a lot more complicated.

    <p>
     The next time jump was bigger, shooting the town of Westview twenty years into the future, rather than the standard ten Wanda had chosen for the past four upgrades.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, it was the beginning of the new millennium greeting the residents  of Westview with CD Walkman’s, low-rise jeans, and glittery butterfly clips.
    </p>
    <p>
     At least, these were the items that had appeared in Agatha’s house once the spell had completed its changes.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the transformation occurred this time, Agatha had clenched her eyelids tightly together whilst the magic had sparked around her, wrapping everything in sight within it's scarlet fronds, making different items glow bright red as their particles were rearranged, modernising the entire town in under a minute. This was the issue Agatha had found at not being under Wanda’s spell. Because, unless she was asleep, Agatha would feel the painful burn of magic across her skin every single time Wanda decided to redecorate. This was a very different experience to all of those townsfolk caught entirely within the enchantment, as they would be frozen in place, blind and deaf to any changes occurring around them, even changes to their own clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eventually though, as all things did, the burst of magic came to an end and the heat of sorcery fled, leaving the room feeling far chillier than it had been before the shifting energies of transformation had warmed everything up. Agatha knew then, once everything felt suddenly cooler, that it was safe to open her eyes to see what changes had been made.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been in her bathroom this time, in the middle of brushing her teeth and readying herself for the day. So the moment she unclenched her eyelids, she was able to study her reflection. Fortunately her hair was still long,
     <i>
      thank fuck
     </i>
     , and loosely curled, hanging prettily over her shoulders. Her make-up had been done well too, and she was extremely pleased to see her eyebrows had been left alone, aware that the era the town had now been sequestered into was infamous for the ultra-thin eyebrow; a trend Agatha had always despised, then and now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze dropped down her own reflection, following the line of her body as her eyebrows rose high up towards her hairline.
    </p>
    <p>
     She whistled appreciatively, turning to get a full look at the black velour tracksuit that the eighties-styled clothes she had been wearing had been transformed into.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tilting her head slightly, she read the mirrored words emblazoned on her rear, “Naughty,” she murmured to herself slowly. Her lips pulled down in a contemplative expression, before she shrugged in blasé agreement with the statement, "true".
    </p>
    <p>
     Whilst walking from the bathroom to her bedroom, she was pleased to see a few modern amenities added here or there. It was still the turn of the millennia, so nothing too exciting, yet she was pleased to see an actual television in her bedroom instead of just a radio.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was at this moment, just as she was heading towards the collection of video's neatly stacked beside the TV, eager to see what movies Wanda’s magic had picked out for Agnes to enjoy, that the flash of a figure passing her bedroom door made her jump and spin around.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who in the hell?” she hissed, immediately darting after them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she entered the hallway, another glimpse of a body turning to head down the stairs caught her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey!” she yelled, intent on finding out who exactly was clambering around her house without permission.
    </p>
    <p>
     Echoing footsteps sounded from below, the thud of boots on hardwood floors, as she hurried after them down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The interloper was heading away from her towards the front door, so she couldn’t immediately identify who it was. She could tell though that it was a man from the breadth of his shoulders and the narrowness of his hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt anger spark in her blood then, fuelled by a mixture of impatience at being forced to chase this intruder down, and the sheer audacity of this stranger being somewhere he shouldn’t be.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey fuckface!” she yelled the moment she landed on the bottom step, having jumped several in the middle, drawing her purple fire close to the surface of her palms.
    </p>
    <p>
     The man didn’t run though and he didn’t do anything threatening either. Instead, he span in place and waved happily at her with a friendly smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning, ma’am,” he said, voice bright with morning pep, “did you sleep well?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She dropped heavily off the final step, eyeing him warily. Her arms rose up to cross tightly across her chest as she dragged unimpressed eyes up his body to the top of his head, taking in the wrinkled shirt and messy hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ralph!” She barked, throwing her arms from where they had been crossed upwards in a gesture of pure exasperation, before dropping them heavily to slap against the side of the thighs, “what the hell are you doing out of the attic?! How did you get out?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     He frowned at her, looking perplexed, “I have to get to work,” he pointed a thumb over his shoulder towards the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
     She scoffed, “since when do you
     <i>
      work
     </i>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He laughed, although it was an awkward sound, one of confusion not amusement, “erm, ever since I signed the lease on the attic room?” Ralph chuckled again, this time more genuinely, “obviously! As if you would have let me live here without proof of income”. He shook his head in amusement, before continuing, “I remember how your wife joked about smothering me in my sleep if the rent was ever late”.
    </p>
    <p>
     His laughter petered out then as his eyes fogged over and he got lost in the false memory embedded in his mind, “at least I think she was joking”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph frowned at the floor for a few moments, obviously trying to clarify his thoughts through the scarlet fog no doubt holding his synapses captive. Within a few short moments though, he jerked his head up, his bright smile was back in place too, almost as though someone had pressed reboot on his system.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, it’s been great chatting to you Mrs Valdez, but I really need to get to work. I don’t want to be late!”
    </p>
    <p>
     And with that lovely little bomb dropped in her lap and left to explode, he waved and turned back towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     He didn’t make it far though, for the moment his back was to her she swiped a single hand and he was unconscious, slumped in a heap on the floor within seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was hard to breath through her mouth with the intensity in which her jaw was clenched. She was certain that if she were to see herself right now, that the vein in her forehead would be bulging and her eyes would be crazed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Mrs Valdez!
     </i>
     ” she hissed, disbelieving the name as her own even though it made a sickening amount of sense.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of a key in a lock sounded out then, momentarily distracting Agatha from her anger. She looked up just in time to see the door thump to a premature stop the moment it met Ralph’s unconscious body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face appeared through the narrow gap, a broad predatory smile on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Honey I’m home,” she crowed, whilst beginning to shunt the door back and forth against the weight blocking her entry, which in turn caused Ralph to groan slightly as he was pushed further into the hallway, still unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha fumed silently, watching this pantomime play out in her hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was finding it difficult to think of the words that would communicate just how she was feeling about this new amendment to Agnes's life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Until finally, she settled on an exhalation of roared frustration and snapped her fingers, causing a spark of purple to shoot towards Ralph, who was promptly transported in a puff of smoke from the hallway to the basement.
    </p>
    <p>
     She would deal with him later.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for Rio. Well, she would deal with her now.
    </p>
    <p>
     With another flick of her wrist the front door slammed shut behind her
     <i>
      wife
     </i>
     . Rio, of course, didn’t jump, but her grin did broaden, giving her that feral, unhinged edge that always made Agatha feel slightly weak in the knees.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So,” Agatha spat, spinning on her heels to head towards the kitchen and pour herself a glass of whiskey, even though it wasn’t even ten in the morning yet, “you have been re-cast, have you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who was now wearing era appropriate cargo pants and a black tank top, sauntered after her. Her hair was pulled back in a high ponytail, and she was fiddling with one of the hoop earrings she had in, which frustratingly enough, drew the eye naturally to the slender line of her throat and the sharp jut of her jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I did,” Rio replied, eyes dropping to take a lazy stroll up Agatha’s body, evidently appreciating the velour tracksuit and the way it clung to her body’s curves, “finally got the part I wanted”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed, as the majority of her anger drained out of her. She slumped forward, leaning her forearms on the counter, before groaning “why would she do this to me? I thought she liked Agnes!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked and stalked closer, taking a moment to read the word printed across her pants, “what? Print "naughty" across your ass?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ignored Rio's question, choosing instead to huff loudly and lay her forehead down on her arms so her torso was practically laying on the work surface. Rio didn’t allow her to sulk for long though, as she promptly slapped a hard palm against Agatha's ass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t know whether to feel thrilled that you’re wearing this, or rip Wanda’s throat out for putting you in it. She must have looked to know how good this would look on you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The action jolted Agatha into a standing position again, although with Rio behind her and the counter in front, she had no escape from the warm body behind her, nor the hot palm that stayed cupped against the round curve of her rear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” Agatha’s voice was a breathed warning, a thin, delicate line that she knew Rio wouldn’t hesitate to trample all over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s voice drew nearer to her ear, so close she could feel the gentle flutter of her words as she spoke, “what? You’re my wife now aren't you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shuddered when Rio’s other hand lifted to pull her hair away from her neck, exposing her throat to soft lips. Immediately, Rio started to drag her mouth up and down the tender flesh, tracing the straining tendon that had appeared when Agatha's head tilted to one side without conscious thought, giving Rio more access to the sensitive skin of her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was surprised at how deep her voice sounded as she quipped, “I was your wife before too, or were you lying about that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s teeth nibbled on the thin skin above her pulse, which was fluttering like the wings of a nervous bird, before drawing away slightly to husk into Agatha’s ear, “you have always been my wife, even Wanda could see that you belong to me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Rio’s hands trailed up the curve of her hip, stopping for a moment to palm it greedily, before dragging it up and around to her stomach so she could tug Agatha’s body back into her own. Simultaneously, her other hand traced upwards to grip Agatha's throat. Slowly, she pressed the pad of her thumb into the soft flesh under Agatha’s jaw, pushing her head over even further to expose more of her skin to Rio's hungry mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could feel her resolve to stay away from Rio's warmth dissolving like ice over a fire, turning first to liquid before disappearing entirely in a cloud of steam. Her body arched backwards into Rio's, as one of her own hands travelled to tighten Rio's hold over her own throat and the other crept around to the small of Rio’s back, intent on holding her close.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, having sensed Agatha’s eager reaction to her seduction, slipped the hand she had over Agatha’s stomach under the thin velour jacket she was wearing to run a greedy palm over the hot skin of her abdomen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck,” Agatha hissed when Rio got bolder and bit the side of her throat, hard. This had always been an element of their relationship that they had both always enjoyed, the ferality of the act.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me come home to you,” Rio’s words were whispered into the skin she had just bruised and claimed, “let me live
     <i>
      here
     </i>
     again," the palm under her jacket dragged upwards, trailing over the sensitive skin of her breast to settle headily over Agatha's pounding heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had been two seconds away from agreeing, from spinning around in the circle of Rio’s arms to capture that damn devilish mouth with her own, from reacquainting herself with the taste of Rio's lips, when the slap of a newspaper against glass, flung by an unbothered teenager on a bicycle at the kitchen window, violently lurched Agatha back to reality.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We shouldn’t,” she whispered, clenching her eyes tightly to try and force her heart back into its normal rhythm. She didn’t push Rio away, unable to push her away when being close to her felt so much like returning home after a long journey, as comforting as the smell of a wood fire on an evening claimed by frost. So instead she pat the hand on her stomach twice, indicating that Rio should release the possessive grip she had on her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     A tired, almost grief-ridden sigh sounded from over her shoulder, before the hands gripping her loosened, then slipped away completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha resented how desperately she wanted their warmth back the instant they were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     She inhaled deeply, before turning to point towards the stairwell that led down to the basement, determined now to move on from whatever had just happened between the two of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ralph is no longer my husband in Wanda's narrative. He thinks he's our lodger now, so obviously Wanda has made a few changes".
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at her for a few short moments, eyebrows raised in resentful disbelief that Agatha was just going to pretend like they hadn’t been three seconds away from consummating their marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally though, she exhaled slowly, folded her arms and leant back against the counter behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well duh,” she said, with slightly more ire in her tone than normal, which for Rio was saying something, “Wanda obviously thinks she split us up”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded, “she does. She asked me when we were over there the other morning if something
     <i>
      big
     </i>
     had come between us, something that she could help us fix”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes widened, she looked impressed, “bold of her to hint at the curse with someone she believes to be trapped by it. Meddling with perception magic like that could cause the entire thing to collapse”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed tiredly and wandered to the fridge. Immediately, she started to pull out all of the ingredients needed to make pancakes; one of Rio’s favourites.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know," she groaned, "and now she has gone and changed Ralph’s role from husband to lodger, and yours from neighbourhood lurker to my wife”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked knowingly, eyes intent as she watched Agatha’s hands start to stir the pancake batter, “technically, I was already your wife”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The stirring of the batter got slightly more violent as Agatha felt her frustration grow at just how true Rio's words were. She had feared Wanda would do something like this after that disastrous morning at Wanda’s house with the twins, pushing her and Rio together like dolls.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slapping the whisk down beside the bowl, she turned to slam a frying pan onto the cooker, let a slab of butter melt down to a greasy puddle before pouring a generous portion of pancake mix into the pan.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whilst the pancake bubbled from beige to golden brown, Agatha kept her face tucked down as she thought through her options and tried to figure out the best way to deal with all of these curveballs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, to her credit, remained quiet, giving Agatha a moment to ponder things silently.
    </p>
    <p>
     It only took a few minutes until the pancake was cooked, so whilst still lost to her own thoughts Agatha slipped it from the pan onto a plate, spun and shoved it across the counter towards Rio, who had, in her boredom, started to carve a geometric pattern into the wooden work surface with her curved knife.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grabbed the syrup from the cupboard and pushed it towards Rio, choosing to ignore the vandalism. It wasn’t her house after all and to be frank, she didn’t give a shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right,” she clapped her hands together, “Wanda’s going to crack soon enough, but I need to think of something that will speed things up, then I can finally get out this damn town”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who had poured so much syrup onto her plate it had overspilled and was now seeping onto the graffitied work surface, looked up at Agatha with a fierce scowl. Although, it did lose some of its power with the way her cheeks were bulging from the amount of pancake she had shoved into her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me guess?" she spat through a mouthful of pancake, spraying crumbs across the kitchen island towards Agatha, "you want to speed things up to get away from me again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The question was heavy, loaded with ammunition from their past that had grown rotten with furious resentment and desperate pain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s voice abandoned her in the face of Rio's bluntly spoken, yet terrifyingly accurate perception. She had grown used to not having anyone around who had the undeniable ability to call her out like that, who actually knew her and the reasons she made the choices she did better than herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     What made the accusation worse was how true the allegation actually was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because she
     <i>
      did
     </i>
     want to get away from Rio again. Although her reasons had changed, having transformed and mutated with every moment they had spent together over the last few weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knew it was cowardly, she knew it was unfair and selfish, but she couldn’t stop that instinct she had to run. To get as far away from Rio as possible, if only to protect herself from just how vulnerable Rio made her, from how soft Agatha became around her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because Agatha knew now, she knew, without a single doubt how much she still loved her wife. How desperately her body, her heart, even her magic yearned for the witch stood staring back at her. It had been a confounding thing to be confronted with, especially after an entire century of trying to persuade herself that the burning emotion she felt storming through her veins at thoughts of Rio was now hatred and no longer love.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had managed it eventually, had convinced herself that she didn’t even like the green witch, let alone loved her anymore. Yet the moment their hands had brushed, her fallacy had crumbled to dust around her, causing swirling tides of her own lies to choke her with the truth; that she loved Rio as deeply, as truly, and as furiously as she always had. As she always would.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet the thought of Rio knowing the truth, of being forced to feel as exposed, as vulnerable as Agatha had when Nicholas died and her heart had shredded itself to a bloody pulp beneath her ribs, was beyond her wildest terrors. Even the possibility of experiencing pain of that calibre, of that potency
     <i>
      again
     </i>
     shot fear through her heart, for Agatha knew she wouldn’t survive it a second time. She had barely survived it the first. So she had to go and she couldn’t let Rio follow her. It had to be soon too, because Agatha knew the longer those dark, knowing eyes continued to perceive her, the more likely it became that she would give in to her base instincts and throw herself at Rio's feet, pleading with her to stay, to love her again, to simply exist with her for eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her jaw had been flapping uselessly the entire time her mind had been spinning through these terrifying thoughts, all the while trying to search for the right combination of words that might actually work as an effective excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know what?” Rio ripped the final chunk of pancake from the fork with her mouth, flashing her sharp, white teeth as she did so and making the bruise on Agatha’s throat ache needily, “don’t worry about answering that question right now. We both know what the true answer is”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finished chewing before swiping two fingers through the puddle of syrup on the work surface. Then with quick steps she reduced the space between their bodies, managing to trap Agatha against the counter again, only this time they were facing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her dark eyes were layered with frustration; a swirling mix of anger and fury; each strand born from a different upset or insult Agatha had dealt her over the years.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, she raised her fingers and swiped the sticky, sweet syrup over Agatha’s lips before bringing her hand up to her own mouth to suck them clean. Through instinct, Agatha’s tongue poked out to lick the syrup from her lips. Rio’s eyes zoned in on the movement as her pupil swallowed her iris, turning brown eyes black.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio drew even closer still, her voice a deep ancient rumble, like the earth itself was speaking. It was a voice that reminded Agatha of Rio’s true power, of what she was, of
     <i>
      who
     </i>
     she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But do mark my words,
     <i>
      wife
     </i>
     ,” the fingers Rio had just licked clean drifted back up and swiped against her mouth again, following the same path Agatha's tongue had just taken, “this conversation is not over.
     <i>
      This
     </i>
     is not over".
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Rio took several steps back and grinned at her like she hadn't just caused Agatha's heart rate to gallop beneath her breast, that same devilish smirk that had seduced Agatha all those years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Plus, I think I have an idea of just how you can use your ex boy-toy to get into Wanda’s head”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who was still reeling from the heady pulse set off deep in her stomach by Rio’s latest antics, took a moment to actually perceive what Rio had just said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hhmm?” she managed to grit out through her tightly clenched jaw, afraid if she actually opened her mouth to speak, words she hadn’t authorised her mouth to say would jump from her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s responding grin was wolfish, as though entirely aware of the affect she had on Agatha’s body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know how to get in Wanda’s head. We’re going to have to enchant him though,” she jerked her chin towards the basement, where Ralph was probably still lying in an unconscious heap.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh?” Agatha finally felt confident enough to actually speak, although her voice was admittedly far huskier than normal, “how so?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let’s just say, I know a guy,” Rio shrugged flippantly, before wandering over to draw her fingers through the puddle of syrup again. She took her time sucking them clean, her gaze holding Agatha hostage across the kitchen as she did so. Finally, once she was satisfied with just how fast Agatha’s breathing had become, she removed her fingers from between her lips with a salacious pop and shrugged again, “or at least I
     <i>
      knew
     </i>
     a guy. Found him in Sokovia with more holes in his body than a golf course before I led him home”.

    <p>
     Between the two of them, it had only taken a single afternoon to enchant Ralph into believing himself to be Wanda’s brother, Pietro.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was amusingly simple really: a few spells to change his physical appearance, one quick download of the Maximoff family history directly into his mind, and a single incantation to increase his natural speed and he was ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had dropped him off on Wanda’s doorstep like a baby on the steps of an orphanage, still slightly confounded by the amount of magic still whizzing through his mortal body. It had felt much like playing a round of ring and run when she had pressed the doorbell, been forced to wait a few short seconds for the chime to sound out, and then sprinted down the path, all the while trying desperately not to laugh and give herself away, back towards Rio who was crouched behind the hedges that separated her house from Wanda’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha managed to slide behind the cover of the shrubbery just as she heard the door opening and Wanda’s shocked gasp. At which point she had been forced to bite down hard on her own lip to stop any guffaws of amusement from escaping. However, the moment Wanda ushered Fietro into her home, they both collapsed with mirth, giggling like children.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt good, nostalgic almost to be doing this alongside Rio. It should have set off alarm bells in her mind, warnings about not letting the green witch too close, yet the laughter they were sharing, the genuine amusement and delight at causing chaos together again felt much like stretching a muscle that had become stiff out of disuse; it felt good.
    </p>
    <p>
     And much like a warmed muscle, the moment it stretched, the painful pressure eased and Agatha found herself resting her hand over Rio’s on the soft grass, with, unbeknownst to even herself, an exceptionally gentle smile on her face as she watched the joy of the moment play out across Rio’s features.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who had still been peering through the shrubs trying to see if she could catch a glimpse of what was undoubtedly a dramatic evening unfolding in the Maximoff household, was completely unaware of the blue eyes tracing over her face or of Agatha’s soft expression, one that was so fully rooted in yearning it would have been impossible for Agatha to deny it’s presence if questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly though, much like a sunset burning across the horizon, that same smile started to flicker and to dim, before it slipped away unseen, a wisp of a want exhaled on a breath and swallowed by time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned to her then, a devious smirk still on her face from the mischief they had concocted, causing a similar strike of that resounding longing, that same yearning she had only just managed to swallow down, to pound so painfully deep inside Agatha’s heart it felt entirely too much like homesickness, to say, “should I set their trash cans on fire too?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She waved her hand until a flickering nest of green flames was hovering in her palm, but when she raised her arm as if to flick it towards Wanda’s front yard, Agatha grabbed her elbow and tugged it back down, stubbing the spell out into a wisp of smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe another night,” Agatha compromised, tugging Rio up from the ground to lead her back to her house, or rather Ralph’s house. Rio grumbled slightly, yet the moment Agatha slipped her hand down her wrist to grip her hand, she fell silent and followed without complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest of their evening, surprisingly, remained peaceful. Or rather, it remained peaceful until it was time for bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, absolutely not,” Agatha stated, standing with her hands gripping each side of the doorframe and her feet braced against the threshold on either side, using her body as a blockade against Rio, who had tried to follow her into the master bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh come on,” Rio rolled her eyes, “I stole your virtue centuries ago, stop acting so prudish”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes even harder, “that is so far from the point”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked and drew closer so she could whisper, “what are you afraid will happen huh? It’s just sharing a bed. A double bed too, plenty of space for two”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scowled at her before quickly darting to the left to block Rio’s sudden attempt at diving passed her, only for Rio to feint right and slip through the small gap she had left unguarded. Instantly, Rio dove for the bed and starfished across it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Spinning on the spot, Agatha narrowed her eyes and clicked her fingers, causing a flurry of amethyst smoke to erupt around Rio’s prone figure, engulf her in its purple haze and deposit her at the bottom of the stairs, right on her ass with a loud thump.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked when she heard Rio’s voice thunder out a furious cry from the floor below.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Pillows and blankets are…” she shrugged flippantly from the doorway, watching with a feline smirk as Rio ascended the stairs and started to storm down the hallway like the ghoul she was, “…around here somewhere... probably. I don’t know, it’s not actually my place”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she slammed the door in Rio's face, but not before sending a final wink towards Rio though, who had been darting forward to close those final few feet of space between herself and the bedroom door, with her lips drawn back in a furious sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
     The door handle turned a few times, but the ward Agatha had carved into the metal glowed softly, keeping Rio out. It didn’t take long for Rio to understand then that it was indeed magic preventing her from entering Agatha's room, so instead of continuing to try and break in, she spoke loudly, her words muffled yet still audible through the wooden door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright Agatha, you win”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly Agatha felt her victorious grin drop; she knew that tone and it stank of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio continued, “sleep well sweetheart,” and then she heard her footsteps walking back down the hallway towards the other bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     All was still for a tense minute, and then, just as Agatha was about to exhale with relief, believing that she had actually gotten away with her antics, she felt a sharp draft blowing across her now bare skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her neck snapped down, and immediately she could see that every stitch of clothing she had been wearing had been vanished amongst a fog of emerald fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha roared out her frustration, uncaring that Rio, who was now undoubtedly smirking like the devil, was next door and could hear all of the colourfully furious sounds erupting from behind her bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Spinning around, Agatha stormed towards her wardrobe to find some replacements. Yet on opening it, a second growl of loud fury was immediately squeezed out from between her clenched teeth, for every article of clothing Wanda had hexed into her closet had been replaced by a matching set of forest green lingerie.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seconds later, all she heard in response to her thunderous anger was that familiar cackle, echoing down the hallway and through the wall that currently separated them.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXX
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately, whatever spell Rio had cast on her clothing had dissipated by the morning and she was relieved to see another velour tracksuit hanging in her closet. This time the velvety material was a dark purple with the word “Juicy” stamped across the ass.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deciding she was going to be the bigger person and simply ignore Rio’s presence; Agatha descended the stairs intending for breakfast to be a silent affair. Which lasted all of thirty seconds, for the moment Rio realised Agatha was giving her the cold shoulder, she enchanted chunks of charred toast to fly off the counter and smack Agatha in the face whenever she raised her spoon to try and eat a mouthful of cereal.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Quit it!” Agatha finally roared, when the ninth burnt lump of bread hit her mouth, instead of the bite of granola she had been expecting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned in victory the moment Agatha addressed her and was quick to pull herself up to sit cross-legged on the kitchen island, right in front of Agatha’s bowl of cereal. Instantly, she reached out a hand and started to twist a lock of Agatha’s long hair around her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Guess what?” Rio whispered, as she started to pick through Agatha’s bowl of granola for the raisins she knew Agatha wouldn’t eat with her other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glared up at her before grunting out a monosyllabic “what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s Samhain”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, Agatha felt her posture straightening as she glanced at the calendar pinned to the wall across from her. On confirmation a broad grin lit her face up, “so it is!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who having eaten all of the raisins in Agatha's breakfast had now started on the almond slices, smirked down at her from her place on the counter. “What’s the costume going to be then?” she scoffed, “let me guess? A witch?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s mouth dropped open with dramatic offence as she waved a hand at herself. Instantly, her purple tracksuit transformed into a short black dress with slightly puffed sleeves, a tall stereotypical witch’s hat landed on top of her head, and some stylish streaks of grey appeared as highlights threaded throughout her naturally dark hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t knock the classics babe,” Agatha smirked at her, tugging on the brim of her new hat so it would sit at a jaunty angle on her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Grinning, Rio slid from the counter with the smooth grace of a cat before waving a hand at herself, just as Agatha had done.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly, a matte black cloud of smoke simmered around the green witch, descending heavily until it was layered over Rio’s body as a thick cloak. It was long and slightly ragged, encasing her entire figure from head to toe. Beneath the robe, Rio now wore a black dress with an intricately carved chest piece which left enticing flashes of bare skin free across her stomach and the skirt possessed a long slit up one side, baring a tanned thigh to Agatha’s heated stare. The cloak was hooded, draping heavily over Rio’s head, and held in place upon her dark hair by a laurel wreath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I would never knock the classics
     <i>
      babe
     </i>
     ,” Rio drawled, pulling Agatha’s eyes up from the golden skin now freely on display back to her face, which was now a half skeletal visage; a vision only made more impactful by the way the white of exposed bone now sat in striking contrast to the shadowy depths of Rio's dark cloak, “I
     <i>
      am
     </i>
     the classics”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was struck then by a bolt of heat so intense she nearly had to take a step backwards to brace herself against its impact. The issue being, Rio was always attractive, in whatever clothes she wore, in whatever style from whatever decade, she was always a beautiful sight with a deeply magnetic aura. Yet in her true form, when Rio allowed herself to return to the powerful roots of herself, of
     <i>
      who
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      what
     </i>
     she truly was, well it was a decimating sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha, well Agatha hadn’t seen Rio like this in over a century, and the sight of her like this again; it stole the air from her throat with a shock so powerful it left Agatha stranded in the current of her own attraction. Desperately, she tried to pull away from the source drawing her closer, until all of her energy was spent and she finally slipped closer, into the hands waiting to welcome her home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without conscious thought, Agatha stood and drew closer to the deity stood in the kitchen she had stolen. Rio remained still, holding herself tightly with muscles tensed, waiting with narrowed eyes to see what Agatha was going to do, only to exhale quietly the moment Agatha’s warm palm met her cold cheek. The bone thawed then beneath Agatha's hand as Rio’s face returned to it’s normal appearance, one of dark eyes, full lips, and warm, flushed skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You certainly are, aren’t you?” Agatha’s voice was awe-filled, as taken by the majestic site of Rio as she always had been, “truly a vision”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, as though under a spell, although no charm had been cast toward her, she cupped Rio’s jaw and drew their faces together, not stopping until the soft press of Rio’s lips met her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     They both froze the instant their lips touched, each just taking in the familiar press of the other’s mouth, a mere pause of momentary surprise that this was even happening between them. Then, quite suddenly, like an open flame being held to a crop of dry wheat in the heat of summer, a spark suddenly caught, smouldered, and then spread, as they both jerked forward, almost harshly, to pull the other closer, always closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rios’ arms wrapped tightly around Agatha’s waist, hauling her so firmly against her own torso that Agatha’s lungs capacity condensed and her witch’s hat was knocked from her head, floating to the floor in silent descent. Agatha’s arms went in the opposite direction, winding securely around Rio’s neck to keep her pressed snug up against her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment they drew apart to each gasp a desperate breath, a shuddered sigh fluttered from between Agatha’s lips. It was her body’s relieved exhalation at having been provided, at long last, something it had been craving so desperately, like a woman dying of thirst in the desert, finally stumbling across a lagoon of fresh, clear water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their embrace was only broken for the few seconds it took to each draw breath and for Rio to raise a hand from Agatha’s waist to her jaw, intent on reuniting their lips a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second kiss was headier, their natural desperation for one another bubbling to the surface as Agatha pushed her body weight against Rio, not stopping until the green witch was pressed up against the wall beside the kitchen doorway. She loosened her arms from around Rio's neck to wrap possessive fingers over the dip of Rio's waist, gripping tightly at the exposed flesh and relishing in the shudder she felt rattle through Rio as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, never one to back down from a challenge, returned the favour by dragging one hot palm down to grab a handful of Agatha's ass and the other upwards to cup a breast with a greedy fingers. She then dragged her tongue along the seam of Agatha’s bottom lip, demanding entry which was granted immediately. Evidently relishing how pliable Agatha felt in her arms, she felt Rio smirk through their kiss the moment she heard a husky moan escape from Agatha's throat in response to her attentions.
    </p>
    <p>
     They kissed until the demand for oxygen became intoxicating and were forced to gasp apart, both of them panting down desperate gulps of air as they stared at one another, both of their eyes dark with the dilation of black pupils across lighter irises, as they took in the mussed hair and swollen lips of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fucking hell,” Agatha hissed, as weak a woman as any to the sight before her, before she bent her head down to run her open mouth up Rio’s throat, searching for that familiar place below Rio's ear that had always been hers. The moment she found it, she bit down as hard as Rio had on Agatha's throat only the day before. Instantly, Rio’s body jerked against hers in satisfaction and she raised a hand to the back of Agatha’s head, holding her there beneath her jaw, insisting Agatha continue her fruitful exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
     A loud ringing finally managed to persevere through the haze they had descended into together, it’s irritating shrillness as much a frustrating distraction as it was a summons to return to the reality they actually existed in. A reality where Agatha and Rio were no longer a pair whose names belonged pressed up against one another, but were now two estranged statements, separated by an abundance of pain and the depths of a history so long it would take just as much time to explain its intricacies.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her lips from Rio’s skin but stayed close for a few gasping moments, aware her panting breaths would feel like a series of hot waves against the mottled flesh beneath her mouth. After a few still moments, she drew away completely. A simple detachment of one body entangled with another, moving first her face from the nook between Rio’s shoulder and jaw, then her torso, and finally her hands from the hot skin at Rio’s waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      What the fuck is that?
     </i>
     ” Rio’s voice was two-toned, with a bassy vibration bouncing after every word she spoke, revealing to Agatha just how close Rio was to losing the weakened grip she had on the frayed thread of her control.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s the doorbell,” Agatha answered, her voice an appealing blend of deep tones and huskiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stared at Rio, taking in the vision her wife made and memorising the way she was still braced against the kitchen wall with her chest heaving, lips swollen, with the mottled line of pink running up her throat that followed the route Agatha’s teeth and lips had blazed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finding it difficult to tear her eyes away, Agatha finally muttered, “stay here,” before turning to answer the door, for whoever was on the doorstep was still there and stubbornly demanding entry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled the door open and forced a cheerful smile onto her face the moment she saw it was Wanda, Fietro, and her two boys at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh hi guys! Happy Halloween!” she crowed brightly, remembering then to run both of her hands through her hair and to at least try and appear less like she had just been ravishing her wife in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who of course, hadn't done as Agatha had told her to, drew close behind Agatha and loomed over her shoulder in the doorway, looking very much like the grim reaper made infamous by folklore; the irony of which was not lost on Agatha in the slightest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you want?” Rio asked bluntly, wrapping both her arms around Agatha’s waist to haul her back against Rio's front and lay her chin on Agatha’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda, who was smirking at them knowingly with a frustratingly pleased sparkle in her eye, didn’t look offended in the slightest at Rio’s curt tone. Instead, she glanced at the dappled skin of Rio’s throat and shot a subtle wink over the top of the twins’ heads at the pair of them, ensuring her children didn't see it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Happy Halloween ladies! Oh don’t you two look fabulous!” Wanda cried, she pointed a finger at Agatha, “let me guess… a vampire?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha huffed, frustrated at the blush she could feel blossoming across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm obviously a witch,” she pointed to her head only to realise then that her hat, the most recognisable feature of her costume, was still on the floor in the kitchen. “...I do have a hat too,” then with a flustered wave she gestured towards the kitchen, “it’s in there”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s smirk, if at all possible, grew bigger, “oh
     <i>
      of course
     </i>
     ". She then turned towards Rio, who was staring her down from over Agatha’s shoulder, “and Rita, what are you dressed as hmm? Let me think for a moment".
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda placed a fingertip to her chin as she thought through the possibilities, finally she shrugged in defeat, “boys, Pietro, do you guys have any ideas who Rita could be dressed as?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tommy’s little face lit up as he pointed at Rio, “you’re a Ringwraith from Lord of the Rings!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately Billy grinned too, nodding enthusiastically along with his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could feel Rio softening in the face of the twins excitement and knew the moment she felt Rio’s head tilt against hers, that these boys were about to get their wish fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I sure am. Good guess boys,” Rio agreed, voice an indulgent drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s so cool!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s awesome!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Both of the twins’ voices sounded out at the same time in their enthusiasm, and even Agatha found herself genuinely smiling at their innocent enjoyment of the holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha jolted then, remembering that Agnes would have definitely invited her guests in by now. Evidently she was still distracted, her mind left reeling from what had just happened between Rio and herself. She took a few eager steps backwards and gestured for the guests on her doorstep to come inside. Fortunately, Rio moved without complaint, stepping back with her, obviously content to move as long as she could remain wrapped around Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh gosh, look at the pair of us being so rude. Come on in guys!”
    </p>
    <p>
     However, just before the small group at their door could clamber inside, she flicked her wrist charming several different Halloween decorations to bloom around the house in clouds of purple smoke, for countless bowls of Halloween candy to appear on the kitchen counter, and for a large pumpkin, in a state of mid-preparation, to blossom on the kitchen table, surrounded by old sheets of newspaper and the tools needed to carve it properly.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the twins, Wanda and her fake brother piled in, Agatha pointed the kids towards the kitchen with a mischievous smile, “there is far too much candy in the kitchen for the two of us to finish on our own! Do you boys think you could help us out with some of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The twins beamed, nodding furiously in acceptance of her challenge as Agatha ushered them towards the kitchen, where their shouts of glee at finding such an abundance of candy could be heard from the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda glared at her playfully, “you spoil them Agnes”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fietro piped up then for the first time, a childish grin on his face, “nothing wrong with that! Ladies,” he drawled, winking at both Rio and Agatha before dashing after his nephews, no doubt intending on competing with the twins to see who could eat the most candy in the shortest amount of time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda laughed, blushing slightly at her “brothers” antics, “sorry about him, that’s my brother Pietro, he has come to stay with us for a while and he has absolutely no manners!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha waved a dismissive hand and chuckled as though amused by their family antics,  “nothing to worry about hon, Rita here can’t resist all of that sugar either”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shot Agatha a feral, knowing grin over Wanda’s shoulder, although Wanda’s smirk wasn’t much better.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can see that,” Wanda murmured, eyes travelling down Agatha’s body to take in the way her hair was undoubtedly still mussed and her dress was badly wrinkled, despite her best efforts to neaten up her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
     In order to steer the conversation away from
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     particular direction, for more than one reason too, Agatha asked unnecessarily loudly, “how can we help hon? Not that we don’t love your visits, but I assume you guys all came over for a reason?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda slumped onto the couch, sighing heavily. She opened her mouth to answer Agatha's question, but fell silent to watch in silent curiosity the moment Rio drew her knife from the belt beneath her cloak, then knelt to start carving a floral pattern into the wooden coffee table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda's eyes flickered towards Agatha with her eyebrows raised, evidently waiting for her to berate her wife for vandalising their home, yet for Rio it was a habit as old as time and Agatha was used to it, if not even fond of the talent Rio had for transforming plain-looking furniture into detailed pieces of art with just the sharp tip of her knife and a steady hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Realising that Agatha, or rather “Agnes” wasn’t going to say a word about what her wife was up to, Wanda shrugged before looking towards the kitchen where the twins and Fietro could be heard discussing Ringwraiths and the important role they play in the Lord of the Rings books.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I promised the boys I would take them to the Halloween festival in the centre of town later tonight, but I don’t have time to take them trick-or-treating first. Pietro has offered to take them, but…” she furrowed her brow, trying to find words that wouldn’t imply she didn’t trust her own brother, even though it was clear she didn't, before forcing a laugh, “well, you can see how much of a big kid he is. So, I was wondering if you guys would help him take the boys out for a few hours? Just up and down a few of the houses along the streets closest to home”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course hon!” Agatha said brightly, shooting one of her brightest, most neighbourly smiles at Wanda. Her eyes shot to Rio the moment she agreed, as Rio's head had shot up from focussing on her carving to glare at Agatha with a scowl, shaking her head to the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s smile sharpened the moment it was directed at Rio, “we would be happy to take the twins trick-or-treating,” she softened her voice, “wouldn’t we sweetheart?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The term of endearment did as she hoped it would, as she instantly saw Rio’s posture soften and her face melt into one of exasperated agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine,” she eventually sighed, returning to her woodwork, if not with slightly more aggression.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda beamed, “that's amazing! Thank you guys, seriously! Pietro will be around to help too, it’s just such a relief to know I’m leaving them in such caring, capable hands, you know!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her smile straining at Wanda’s naivety, at how a sorceress powerful enough to cast a spell of this magnitude was unable to sense even a single spark of the mingling power that was currently residing in this simple suburban home. How could she could be in the presence of an actual ancient deity blessed with power enough to control the elements of the earth itself, and a centuries old witch who was thrumming with the absorbed power of countless witches, and not have a single witchy instinct tell her that something about her neighbours was unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t’ you worry hon,” Agatha simpered, ushering Wanda to the door, “you go do whatever it is you have to do, and we will make sure those boys get the most candy of any kid on the street!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda leant forward and pressed a grateful kiss to Agatha’s cheek, “you’re a lifesaver!”
    </p>
    <p>
     And then she turned, opened the door and just as she was closing it yelled out, “bye boys! I’ll see you all at the festival later on tonight!” A mingling, muffled shout of voices responded from the kitchen, each one yelling goodbye through a mouthful of candy and chocolate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha span to eye Rio, who was still perched on the floor, carving her pretty pattern into the coffee table. Although she was now working down the leg, adding flowers and vines in an eye-catching motif.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So,” Agatha sighed, feeling pinned against the front door the moment those dark eyes shot up to hold her in place, “you up for some trick-or-treating? We can make sure the ratio favours trick rather than treat,” she shrugged, a smirk lifting at the corner of her mouth, “could be fun right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s cheek twitched in amusement, “like old times?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded as her puckish smirk thawed into something softer, “just like old times”.

    <p>
     Taking the twins Trick-or-Treating had turned out to be a surprisingly enjoyable venture, although it had certainly helped that every single one of their Halloween troupe had mischief running through their veins.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their evening had started out with at least an attempt to make sure everyone was well behaved, with Agatha leading the twins and Wanda's fake brother from house to house and ordering them to collect extra candy for her and Rio, who was sweeping after them all, still enshrouded in her robes of Death. Not that any of the neighbours were aware of who exactly was passing them by whilst casually chewing on a bar of nougat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, as Agnes in this particular case, was determined to prove to Wanda just how responsible she could be, intent as she was on gaining more of her trust in order to finally discover the origins of Wanda's incredible power. However, her attempts at good behaviour were corrupted the moment they passed a local convenience store, for Rio's grin had broadened roguishly, and with a single swipe of her hand she summoned several trays of eggs to land in a neat stack by her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey boys!" Rio sang cheerfully, capturing the attention of both twins and Fietro, "watch this". With that, she grabbed an egg and hauled it at Dennis's kitchen window where the shell instantly shattered and yolk splattered across the glass in a large, seeping mess.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, all three boys roared with laughter and converged on Rio, who was all too eager to hand a tray to each of her newly acquired allies and wave them off with a broad, feral grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     The carnage from that point was unfounded, as they each started to pelt eggs at cars, houses, and each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, on noticing the chaos Rio had managed to sow behind her back, glared at her smirking wife before starting to storm over towards her. However, just as she was raising a hand to gesture at the raw egg now smeared across the sidewalk, she passed Billy who was continuously throwing eggs at Herb's post-box, yet kept missing.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was such a sad sight that quite suddenly, as though she was momentarily possessed by a particularly puckish ghoul, she grabbed an egg from the tray in Billy's hand and grinned down at him. "You have to aim it like this sweetheart," she raised her hand and pulled the egg back over her shoulder, "you want to line it up straight, draw it back and not let it go until your arm is back over your head alright, helps keep it on target". She did so, demonstrating for him the perfect way to vandalise the neighbours house.
    </p>
    <p>
     The egg did as she had hoped and splattered against the metal side of the post box. Immediately, Billy grinned up at her with amazement, "woah!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't resist smiling back, "your turn champ".
    </p>
    <p>
     His grin brightened as he snatched up another egg, pulled it back as she had shown him and let it loose.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes!" he cried, throwing a fist up in victory the moment the perfectly aimed egg splattered against the post-box.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That' a boy!" she cheered, clapping her hands at his success. Moments later, she was choking back a guffaw of laughter the moment Herb's furious face appeared at the window, staring out at his post-box with wide, shocked eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh shit! He's seen us! Come on kid," she threw Billy a devilish smile, one born of chaotic camaraderie, before grabbing his arm to drag him back down the street towards the others, who were hiding behind the trunk of a large oak tree, cackling all the while.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had then tried, valiantly she might add, to put her foot down and steer them all back to the type of Trick-or-Treating behaviour children didn't get sent to juvenile detention centres for. But after a single glance at the devious smiles of Rio, the twins, and Fietro, she soon found herself with an armful of toilet rolls, giggling like a child as the five of them successfully TP’d Mrs Hart’s house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their antics caused them to be late meeting Wanda at the Halloween festival, although the other witch didn't seem to mind nor be aware of the trouble her children and their babysitters had been getting up to in her absence. They stayed for a brief catch up with Wanda, who had invited them to stay and join her family at the festival, however they declined and once the boys had been safely deposited back with their mother, each of them hyped up on the mass amounts of sugar they had consumed and the adrenaline of lightweight vandalism, Agatha and Rio headed back to their house.
    </p>
    <p>
     The entire evening had felt light, joyful, and nostalgic. In truth, Agatha felt her heart brightening as it had done outside of Wanda’s when they had first dropped off Fietro, basking in the simple warmth of Rio’s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet the moment they stepped across the threshold and the door shut soundly behind them, tension as thick and as sweet as syrup swallowed them both. It was as though someone had left a tap of the heady stuff running whilst they were out, and as a result of their negligence, their hallway was now filled with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t help then but compare the sensation of wanting Rio to what an addiction felt like, having experienced that desperate desire for more every single time she had siphoned a witch's power. It was a heady, aching, want. That demanding feeling of desiring a single taste of whatever sin was in control of a person's darkest needs. She had tasted her lips again after all, could even recall, vividly, the exact pressure of Rio’s kiss. The seal of restraint had been broken between them, and it was a well-known fact that once something had been broken, even if it was repaired, it was always weaker for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hallway was dark, a mass of shadows permeated only by a single beam of light slicing through the small panel window above the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes were on her, Agatha couldn't see them in the darkness, but she could feel their heat all the same; they were an exceptionally heady and demanding weight on her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s late,” Agatha found herself whispering, even though they were the only two in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s shadow moved and she knew without having to see, that Rio had tilted her head to the side in that endearingly curious way she so often did.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is,” was Rio's hushed reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     A breath rattled from between Agatha’s lips and she could feel her chest start to heave from the pressure building in the narrow space separating them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe we should…”
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t get to finish her sentence, for in the next moment Rio swept forward and encased her against the wall with both her arms on either side of Agatha’s head; a domineering figure still shrouded in her dark robes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Should
     <i>
      what?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s words were a challenge, a definitive gauntlet that had been thrown at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not a witch to bend to the will of others, Agatha clenched her jaw and tilted it haughtily into the air. She knew that she couldn’t allow a seduction to take place, not like this, not when the issues wedged between them were still there, undiscussed and haunting like phantom anchors, dragging them down into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Should go to bed sweetheart,” Agatha answered simply, ensuring her voice was gentle, knowing well enough that Rio, as much as she might deny it, often desired tenderness, having lived her entire existence as an entity the majority fled from. She heard the bones in Rio’s knuckles creak as her fists tensed against the wall beside her head. A heady frustration bled from Rio's body then. It was born from the hunger they both felt for the other, a hunger that kept nipping at their heels, like a rabid fox eager to pursue a fleeing rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, as predicted Death softened at her kind tone and at the loving endearment. Leaning closer, Rio rested her cloaked head against Agatha’s shoulder, just under her chin. Rio's hands dropped too, landing lightly on the dip of Agatha's waist. It was the exhaustion of centuries weighing on a figure more mortal than most would ever believe.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me stay with you tonight”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s words were a whispered plea spoken against the sensitive skin of her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s arms lifted and wrapped around the figure resting against her, holding her tight. She paused before replying though, gifting herself a moment to consider if this was a sensible course of action or whether it made better sense to re-route from their current destination and send Rio to her own bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then Rio said something else, something that destroyed Agatha's ability to say no, like a cannonball through a barricade made of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have known three lives. I have known the frigid air of my existence before our paths crossed, I have known the blazing heat of being yours, of you being mine, and I have known the barren, desolate, freezing solitude of having lost you, lost you both. Please,
     <i>
      please
     </i>
     don’t ask me stay out in the cold for another night. It’s a weight beyond even the crown on my head or the duty that binds me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio had finished speaking Agatha was already nodding her head, a frantic unconscious movement as her arms tightened around Rio in a protective embrace. Holding her close, she summoned a flurry of amethyst clouds to surround them and deposit them directly onto her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her magic had done as casted, removing any trace of make-up from both of their faces, replaced clothing with soft bedclothes, and cleansed their teeth until they were sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
     They landed together on a bundled pile of bedding; a nest of duvets, blankets, and pillows that had been left unmade that morning. Agatha manoeuvred them both, holding onto Rio as tightly as she was clinging onto Agatha. she slid down until she was laying flat on her back and Rio was nestled into her side, with one arm wrapped tightly over her stomach and one leg thrown over both of Agatha’s, keeping her close. Her head nestled into the space beneath Agatha's jaw, where her throat met her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha noticed the moisture then, as tears slid from Rio’s eyes to pool in the hollow of her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh sweetheart,” she cradled Rio’s head close to her heart as her own tears started to well and bleed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I looked for you in every single face,” the words were a whimpered confession, so quiet Agatha would have missed them if any other noise had permeated the moment, “every single time I felt the pull of a soul in need of me, I would hold my breath until I saw their face, until I knew it wasn’t you lying on the floor, glassy eyed and freezing cold”.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was defining moment in Agatha’s long life, the confirmation of her selfishness. She had always known it was a trait she possessed, had relished in it even, yet the realisation that she had never once considered this reality, that Rio, bound to her duty as the sun was bound to rise, would be forced to continue her work. That the very act of it might mutate into a warped torture of her mind, as she waited for the day Agatha’s death was the one finally beckoning her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a sob choking up her throat, the sensation similar to vomit in the way her own guilt was making her sick. Yet Rio didn’t stop speaking, as though now she had started, she was unable to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And even then, when I knew that the person laying dead at my feet wasn’t you, I still looked around, desperate to see if they might have perished at your hand, waiting for a trace of your magic, or hoping perhaps you might leave me a clue like you used to, a hint as to where I could find you, a trail for me to find my way home”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breathing was ragged as she listened to the glistening, bloodied truth of Rio’s pain.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But you never did, and I was always so cold, so cold I couldn’t sleep”.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a desperate bid to at least attempt to right the wrong, Agatha pressed her lips against Rio’s forehead as she drew the swathe of blankets tighter around Rio’s shoulders, nestling her within them, ensuring she was finally warmer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence descended then, the only noise coming from the gentle sway of the curtains as a sharp October breeze swept through the open window, causing the heavy material to rustle against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, when the emotions blocking her throat had drained enough for her voice to escape, Agatha spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll keep you warm tonight sweetheart, I won’t let the cold touch you again. Sleep now”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s breathing had already deepened and her muscles had already started to relax, turning buttery and soft against Agatha’s body, yet she managed to mumble, “promise?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha squeezed her eyes tightly together, adding the harm she had inflicted to the woman she loved to her long, long list of sins. A fresh wave of tears moistened her eyelashes and dripped down the sides of her face before she tucked her face slightly to nestle her lips against Rio’s forehead. Then, as though swearing an oath whispered the words, “yes my darling, I promise”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And at long last Rio slept, Rio slept like the dead.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
     The following day Agatha awoke to a flat screen television on the wall, Rio’s chest pressed tightly against her back, and Rio's arm wrapped snugly around her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Glancing around, Agatha quickly noticed several other new additions to her bedroom including a smartphone on the bedside cabinet and a reading tablet on the desk. It was technology far more advanced than that available during the turn of the Millennium.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shifted closer, mumbling something incoherent under her breath the moment Agatha wriggled slightly to see if anything else had been modernised. Agatha paused, then sighed the instant she truly registered Rio's embrace; which was both warm and familiar. A siren call, beckoning Agatha to sink backwards into it, to greedily indulge in the sensation of being cradled close, of being loved.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that blaring alarm, the one that had been silenced so effectively by Rio’s tears yesterday evening had started to scream in her mind once more, spreading a sense of panic throughout her body, warning her that she was getting closer to an edge she wasn’t prepared to leap off of. For Rio, as much as Agatha loved her, represented everything that had very nearly destroyed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha suddenly needed distance, so with gentle fingers she grasped Rio’s wrist and tried to wriggle free without waking the green witch. Of course, the moment she did so, Rio awoke and tightened her grip, hauling Agatha’s body tight against her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have never, in the three hundred and fifty years I have known you, been able to get up without waking me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s voice was husky from sleep, sparking a pulse of heat that started to simmer low in Agatha’ stomach. Suddenly aware that her body was about two seconds away from giving up the last few tethers of restraint holding her back from simply straddling her wife, she slapped an impatient hand at the arm still holding her captive.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well maybe if you didn’t have the hearing of a bat, I would be able to slip away. Now, let me up”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snorted from behind her, “a bat? I’m literally a vessel of natural power. As if you could sneak away from me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I managed it well enough before”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment the sharp words slipped from between her lips she regretted them, closing her eyes tightly to await Rio’s reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, instead of anger or acidic words in response, as she had been expecting, Rio simply exhaled once and slipped her arm from Agatha’s waist. Several inches of space appeared between them then, making that small slither of mattress appear as wide as a jagged crevasse, waiting to swallow them both whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That you did,” was all Rio murmured quietly before standing from the bed and treading softly towards the door. Agatha stayed where she was, amongst the rumpled bedding still warm from Rio’s body heat, waiting for a final jab or insult.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet Rio said nothing else, choosing instead to pull the bedroom door open and quietly close it behind her, leaving Agatha to fester in a puddle of her own guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha closed her eyes again and exhaled heavily, attempting to breath out some of the turmoil she felt. However the moment she opened her eyes, she found she had been transported onto a simple sofa in a plain, bare room.
    </p>
    <p>
     A camera was set up to film her from the shoulders up and a glazed-eyed man wearing a baseball cap with the word “PRODUCER” emblazoned across its peak stood beside the stand. He raised his hand and flicked the camera to rolling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, another fight with your wife. What was this one over Agnes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     His voice was monotone, like a bad actor reading directly from the pages of a script, with no inflexion or rhythm to his speech pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced around and then down at herself, realising then that her pyjamas had been transformed into a purple v-neck sweater and dark slacks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” she snapped at the producer, frustrated that whatever madness was currently occurring, was happening right at the moment she needed it to happen least.
    </p>
    <p>
     He repeated the question in exactly the same tone, “so, another fight with your wife. What was this one over Agnes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a scowl settle on her face, for this farce was undoubtedly linked to Wanda’s newest update of Westview's least favourite programme. After all, sitcoms followed certain tropes and a fairly modern inclusion was the art of the confessional; if done right, it created comedy gold.
    </p>
    <p>
     This entire addition was new, however what was even more unusual, was the fact the sitcom aspect of Wanda's enchantment now appeared to be taking place, even when not in direct view of Wanda or Vision. Usually, everything to do with the television show Wanda was insistent on creating happened only within proximity of her family, and had never happened when Agatha had been alone at her house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gathering herself, she was quick to get in character with a bright grin, “oh you know how it is when us ladies sync up. It's pistols at dawn in our household until one of us caves and grabs the chocolate ice cream with fudge chunks from the freezer”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The blank-faced man didn’t react to her answer, but he did ask another question, “Rita seemed upset. Are you going to apologise Agnes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her grin tighten into something malicious and forced herself to inhale deeply, intent on maintaining Agnes’s peppy façade, “well in that case, I’ll be sure to grab the salted caramel from the freezer too”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The producer didn’t look impressed or pleased with her responses, but she must have said something right, for he brought a hand up to the camera and switched it off. The moment he did so, she blinked and found herself back in her bedroom, still dressed in the clothes she had been magicked into.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well shit,” she grumbled, realising things were getting even more difficult than they had been before, in more than one way too.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn’t in her room, nor was she in the kitchen. The bathroom was empty, and the living room was vacant.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who was insistent on reminding herself that she didn’t actually care where Rio was, and that she just wanted to ask whether she had also been dragged away for a confessional interview, frowned heavily as she retraced her steps upstairs, wanting to ensure Rio hadn’t doubled back to nap in Agatha’s bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     She swung the bedroom door open and ripped the covers from the mattress with clawed hands, pulling them into an untidy pile on the floor. The bed was empty, just like everywhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glared furiously at the empty mattress as thought it was personally responsible for Rio’s sudden disappearance, when a sudden pool of inspiration flooded her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The garden!” she clicked her fingers knowingly, where else would a green witch retreat to?
    </p>
    <p>
     She hurried down the stairs and through the kitchen, only to growl under her breath on reaching the back decking.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the garden was empty too, and there weren’t even any blossoms growing amongst the brittle winter grass to indicate Rio had been there recently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where the fuck is she?” Agatha hissed, trying hard to swallow the panic she could feel beginning to bubble up her throat at Rio’s sudden absence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Storming back through the house, she pulled the curtains aside from the front room window and stared out the glass. Scanning her narrowed eyes up and down the street she felt her heart start to pound with anxiety at the green witch's disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, a breeze fluttered around her. Agatha turned quickly to find Rio perched on the arm of the sofa with a guarded expression on her face. She wasn’t dressed in modern clothing, nothing at all like the clothing Agatha was wearing. Instead she had resorted to the clothing she had always preferred; a forest green jacket crafted from weaved vines, grass, and leaves and dark trousers, decorated with golden ruins, threaded in intricate patterns along the matte material. The clothing was tight on Rio's figure, highlighting the attractive curve of her hips and waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, just like usual, the most common emotion Agatha felt in reaction to her own weaknesses, whether that be the flare of attraction she felt at seeing Rio in her own clothing, or her desperate fear at Rio's sudden absence, Agatha felt fury burn in her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where the hell have you been? I was looking for you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged and pulled the dagger from her belt to fiddle with it, “I had business to attend to”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed harshly, “oh
     <i>
      business
     </i>
     , was it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze snapped up to Agatha’s, her eyes harsh, “yes, it was. You know I am bound to it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did, she knew better than most.
    </p>
    <p>
     Choosing to ignore the bait she could feel loaded in Rio’s words, she gestured upstairs, “well go and get changed then. We need to go and see if Wanda is close to cracking or if she needs another push”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slipping from the sofa, Rio wandered towards the fireplace and dug her knife into the stone mantle, causing a hideous screeching noise to resound through the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am not going to get changed”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, loudly, spitefully, “you can’t walk around Westview like that, they already think your bananas. We don’t need to draw any more attention to ourselves”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You misunderstand me. I am not going to get changed because I need to leave again. Something has happened, a disaster of sorts across the sea and there is a town in need of me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha drew back as though she had been slapped and her mocking smile froze into one of strangled fear, “you’re leaving?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha crossed her arms and raised her chin arrogantly, trying to minimise the physical evidence of her anxiety, “for how long?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at her; eyebrows raised with disbelief at Agatha’s sudden demands, which contrasted violently with every other time she had ordered Rio to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     “For however long it takes,” Rio barked a frustrated laugh, “I thought you would be pleased to be rid of me, it’s all you have spoken about since this all started”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s mouth dropped open, uncertain as to how to respond to the statement. It was true after all, yet now facing the reality of it, of Rio being gone again and she alone, it left Agatha's skin prickling with a heavy desire to pull Rio close and not let her go.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet as always, Agatha's pride reared its head as those shutters of self preservation, forged violently through a mother’s hatred and a community's neglect, rattled shut at the first sign of rejection.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who said I wasn’t pleased?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze became heavier. She looked suddenly exhausted, “well, in that case, your wish has been granted. I hope whatever power you find here finally sates you. Nothing else seems to”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And with that Rio swept toward the wall and dragged her dagger down the wallpaper, slicing it neatly in two. A section peeled back away from the wall, revealing a dark cavern backlit with a green glow, as though several thousand fireflies were hovering just out of view.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised her foot to step through and the image of that, of Rio leaving with her shoulders heavy with the burden of loving a witch as difficult to love as Agatha, caused her to jolt forward to grip Rio’s wrist tightly between desperate fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn’t say I was pleased either,” her own voice sounded foreign to her ears, unused as she was to hearing it quite so distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took pity on her and paused her departure, turning slightly to look at Agatha over her shoulder, “that’s the problem Agatha, I am not sure which one is the truth and honestly, I’m not sure you do either”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt tears pool in her eyes as she tightened her grip on Rio’s wrist, “let me figure it out then, give me time to do that”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked away, smiling. It wasn’t a happy smile, it was overloaded with self-deprecation and a fracturing heart, “if you don’t know the answer after one hundred years away from me, then I think that is truth enough. And I do have a job to do”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Desperation spurred Agatha closer, “will you at least come back afterwards? You won’t disappear?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile hardened, “what? Like you did?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swallowed hard, closed her eyes and took the hit; she knew it was deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, like I did” she admitted quietly, her words little more than a whisper, “you have to promise me you won’t do that to me, I know I don’t deserve it, but please don’t. I couldn’t stand it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes travelled down to her own wrist. Those dark eyes studied the fingers gripping her arm so tightly the blood was straining to flow through, turning the tips white with pressure. Slowly, her gaze lifted to capture Agatha's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please my love, please come back to me,” Agatha pleaded, and for the first time since their paths had crossed again, allowed the truth to be visible through her eyes. She was desperate for Rio to see her swirling confusion, her fearful hesitation, her earnest desire, yet also, underneath it all, to see the bruised, scarred heart that still only beat for the green witch before her and the child they had shared and lost.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha waited and felt relief sweep through her body the moment Rio’s gaze softened minutely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t speak, but she did give a single sharp nod of her head, which for Rio was as good as a signature on a contract. Then she turned to escape through the thin door she had crafted, leaving Agatha with a heart full of sorrow and an unspoken fear that this might be the first promise Death, who was the rule of law in the natural world and the keeper of oaths, may just renegade on.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Rio was through the makeshift doorway, the wallpaper zipped back together, sealing shut. The only evidence anything peculiar had ever happened to it was a single indented line down its centre.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked her eyes closed, trying to exhale the pain out in a single ragged breath and pull herself together, to gain focus back on the plan in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet the moment she opened her eyes, she found herself once again sequestered away in that same empty room, perched on a lonely sofa with the blank-faced producer staring at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     He flicked the camera on.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, Rita left you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bristled, “she hasn’t left me”. Her voice was biting, with not a single hint of Agnes in her tone or expression, she was entirely herself; feral and furious. “She has business to attend to, she's coming back”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The producers face remained slack, aside from a single eyebrow twitching upwards by half a centimetre, “she didn’t look very happy, she looked tired, fed up”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her heart pound painfully in her chest at the truth of his words, “we had a fight, but that won’t stop her from coming home. It never does”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn’t sure who she was trying to convince anymore; the producer or herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     He remained silent, giving her space to expand on her statement. The only noise in the room was the gentle hum of the camera equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She will be back,” she reinforced her point through gritted teeth, “she will come back to me, she always does”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll see,” was all he said in that same blank voice, encapsulating Agatha’s fears with two simple words.
    </p>
    <p>
     The producer then lifted a hand and flicked the camera off. Reality warped around her moments later and she was promptly sent back to her living room, where she spent the remainder of her afternoon staring at a slither of wallpaper with a single line running through it.

     It might be fair to assume Agatha spiralled, although she was unwilling to admit it, even to the very end.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had waited, for several days she had waited, biding her time for when Rio would return as she had promised. Yet, she didn’t reappear, not even after a full week of playacting as the gossiping neighbour and enduring several passive aggressive interviews with the blank-faced producer, Rio had still not come home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Initially Agatha remained resilient to her own doubts. She had reassured herself, both verbally and mentally, that Rio would come back, that she always did, that she always would. But when day four slipped passed without any sign of her wife, Agatha’s mood sunk into a far darker recess.
    </p>
    <p>
     From that point, the reality of it all and the pain of that last conversation stuck to the forefront of her mind, like a photograph superglued to the interior of her consciousness. It was the look on Rio’s face as she had left, that heartbroken smile of hers. Her words followed soon after, spinning amongst Agatha’s thoughts. It was primarily Rio's confession, the one she had whispered against the skin of Agatha's throat, of how she had searched for her across the years. It echoed in her mind every moment of the day, as though someone had pushed play on a cassette tape inside her brain and she was unable to find the off switch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sadness followed soon after. It was an emotion Agatha despised entirely, even though she was intimately familiar with its cold hands upon her heart. Then as another day passed, sadness mutated, transforming into a feeling Agatha hated even more than simple melancholy: guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
     After all, Agatha and guilt had never seen eye to eye. It would have been impossible to have lived the life she had and committed the crimes she did if she had ever allowed that particular emotion to rule her.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, Agatha did what she always did when confronted with the consequences of her own actions and an array of emotions she despised; she doubled down and became vicious.
    </p>
    <p>
     And who better to aim all of her pent up fury at, than the woman currently prevailing over a fantasy world that Agatha both envied and hated? For Wanda had everything, literally
     <i>
      everything
     </i>
     Agatha coveted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda had her great unlimited mass of power, she had her dead lover; reanimated and conscious, she had her
     <i>
      children
     </i>
     !?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was an injustice of the highest order that Wanda got everything she wanted, that she could hold a town hostage in order to live out her perfect life. Yet, all Agatha had gained over the centuries was an abundance of heartbreak and grief.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had power sure, but she had ripped it from the hands of dead witches who had all tried to kill her, she had a love in her heart so all-encompassing that at times Rio’s absence made her feel mad, truly insane with the loss of her. Yet she couldn't keep Rio, she couldn't be with her because of all that still remained between them, as thick and as obstructive as a concrete wall, and her son? Her son was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her thoughts followed this dark pattern for the remainder of the week, when she was suddenly struck with a dire, dreadful concept, one that sent her spinning down a reckless path. It was the thought that if Rio, the woman she loved above all others, the woman who knew every single inch of her dark, corrupt soul, no longer considered Agatha a person worthy of pursuit, well, she would have to embrace the only thing she had left. Of course, it was that same ugly darkness that had kept her company from the start, corrupting any spark of goodness she might have possessed if her mother had actually loved her, if her son hadn't been snatched from her arms whilst she slept, if her wife would simply come home.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the darkness, as it always had been, was ravenous, and oh so eager to gape open and swallow her whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     As a result, her determination to discover answers to her original quandary doubled, fuelled by her need for distraction from the bloody, ragged hole in her chest where her heart had once sat. She focussed all of her attention on getting the truth to the questions that had been haunting her since discovering this great orb of scarlet energy: where was Wanda sourcing her immense power? And how, how could Agatha possess it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Her final campaign had started out successfully enough, as every piece she had set to fall did so when designed to, like a grand wave of domino's, one tipping into the other until the larger picture was revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda had trusted Agnes to care for the twins, whilst she had what basically consisted of a magical breakdown, causing the warped reality she had wrapped around the town of Westview to flicker and flash back and forth between the real world and the hex. The twins had followed Agatha trustingly, both of them happy to sit on her sofa and pet Señor Scratchy.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been easy enough from that point to spell them to sleep and then transport them in a cloud of purple smoke to the enchanted room attached to her warded basement. She wasn’t a monster, so she had made sure it was filled with everything two young boys might enjoy whilst waiting for their babysitter to question their mother; bunkbeds set back against the wall, two plush beanbags set on a comfortable rug, a large flat screen on the wall that was hooked up to a selection of video game consoles. A fridge was in the corner, stocked full of cartons of chocolate milk, cans of soda, and ample snacks to feast on.
    </p>
    <p>
     The spiteful part of her had considered removing some of the luxuries she had added in a moment of weakness, but they were sweet boys, sweet boys who reminded her far too much of the son she had lost, so she left them their modern comforts, especially as she couldn’t guarantee them their mother’s life once she had finished her interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
     An opportunity then presented itself to get Wanda alone too. Agatha played the doting neighbour, swooping in to drag Wanda away from a confrontation with Geraldine. From there, it had been a matter of luring Wanda into her enchanted basement where her wards were already drawn and waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their journey through Wanda’s life had been as insightful as it was frustrating. Frustrating because it became clear very quickly that Wanda’s chaos magic stemmed from a life drowning in death and submerged in grief. Yet, Agatha, who had existed for centuries before Wanda had even been born, who had been despised by her mother the moment she entered this world, who had been attacked with the intent to kill by her own coven, whose true love had taken her son's spirit whilst she slept leaving her to wake with his cold, still body in her arms, who had enough rage running through her body to fuel a country, was unable to utilise magic in the same subconscious way Wanda did with such ease. And just to add insult to injury, had also mastered it's application without any sort of tutoring or magical education.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was, put plainly, downright offensive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Naturally things had digressed from that point, ending in a grand battle between the two of them. It felt especially cathartic to finally use the full extent of her magic, to at long last, wipe clean the mask of Agnes and step into the power she had been forced to hide for weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her Arrogance had been her downfall in the end, alongside her greed for more, always more.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had assumed herself to be the player always two moves ahead, yet Wanda had spun the world out from under her by using Agatha's own knowledge against her, exposing the giant wards she had seared into the circular, glowing walls of her hex before stealing every ounce of magic Agatha possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda had floated back to earth, hauling Agatha alongside her, who had no more power to resist the enchantment she had been captured by, who could only bow her head in humiliation as the ground grew closer. Her legs collapsed beneath her the moment her feet touched tarmac, although she did try to retain an unphased exterior, even whilst kneeling in defeat before the scarlet witch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good girl,” she murmured, glaring up at Wanda from under her brow. She was unused to feeling shame settle into a horrible tangled mess beneath her ribs, especially after three centuries of reigning victorious over her fellow witch. It was a humbling experience, and it did not suit her. She didn’t like it.
     <i>
      At all
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “So what now? Just going to lock me up somewhere?” Her voice was brittle with barely disguised fear, a final attempt at bravado. Although Wanda’s response made panic quickly spread throughout her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, not somewhere. Here”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll give you the role you chose. The nosy neighbour”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And for the third time in Agatha’s long life, she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No please”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s face was resigned. It was the expression an executioner wore having decided to finally drop their axe, “I’m sorry”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, you’re not, you’re cruel. You have no idea what you have unleashed, you’re going to need me,” she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If I do, I’ll know where to find you,” Wanda’s eyes drifted over her face as a curious wrinkle appeared between her brows, “I really liked you Agnes. Or Agatha, I suppose. I thought we were friends”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait, wait, wait!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Those were the last words Agatha heard from within her own consciousness, for in the next moment, Wanda leant closer and tapped a soft finger against her temple and in a single whisp of magic, secured Agatha as a prisoner within her own mind and drew the mask of Agnes firmly over everything Agatha knew and everything Agatha was. A ripple of power sizzled over her skin and within seconds every thought, memory, hope, fear, and dream from her long, full life were encased in scarlet tendrils and replaced with daytime television, book club, and almond milk lattes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Glancing up from blinking at the sidewalk, Agnes grinned at finding Wanda, her best friend, standing over her, “oh hiya hon!” Her eyes roved across Wanda’s body, appreciating the scarlet outfit she was donning, “say, that’s some kind of get up you’re wearing. Did I leave the oven on? Or is that just you hot stuff?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda smiled down at her with a pleased, somewhat endeared expression on her face, “you live here now. No one will ever bother you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okie-dokie artichokey,” she chirped back, content to remain in the town she had been born in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda smiled again, Another amused twitch of her lips before starting to turn away from Agnes, who was sat on the floor? Outside?
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, before Wanda was able to turn away entirely, a blazing line of flashing, green light appeared beside her, as the point of a curved blade sliced downward through the glowing air. A section of the street in front of her lifted then, as a figure, covered in mud and leaves and holding a bouquet of wildflowers, stepped through the strange slither of space onto the street, right in front of them. As quick as it had appeared, the rippling doorway disappeared with a final flash of green light.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes felt her heart brighten on realising it was her darling wife, “Rita, honey! You’re finally home from your business trip! Oh how I missed you!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rita however, didn't looked pleased. If anything she looked furious, as angry as she did whenever the Westview Wolverines lost the softball league. Agnes could tell, for she had been quick to notice how badly Rita's hands were shaking, which was a fairly common reaction from her wife to upsetting emotions. What was unusual though, were the sparks of green energy flashing from her palms and the wide eyes that were wild, almost feral.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda too, had noticed the return of her lovely wife and turned to greet her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re a witch
     <i>
      too
     </i>
     ?” her voice was stricken, brimming with rage as scarlet energy swirled around her palms and her pupils flashed red.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rita’s voice was two-toned, almost bassy when she pointed a finger at Agnes and roared back, “
     <i>
      what have you done?!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes was currently not much use to either of them, mainly because, in all honestly, she was finding it difficult to drag her eyes away from her wife. She just looked so beautiful, especially when she was angry and covered in soil, just like she was right now. It wasn't unusual for her to be covered in dirt after all, as she was so often sprinkled in the stuff after spending an afternoon in the garden. Rita was always so keen on ensuring their garden was kept as their own secret oasis, spending hours at a time mowing the grass, repotting plants, and trimming back any dead leaves or branches. She sighed dreamily and let her eyes drift in lazy appreciation down her wife's body, before zoning in on the bunch of wildflowers she was still gripping so tightly their stems had started to bend and were now clearly at risk of snapping.
    </p>
    <p>
     A blush dusted Agnes's cheeks as her smile grew bashful and she couldn’t resist asking after them as she pointed up towards Rita's clenched fist, “Are those for me, my love?”
    </p>
    <p>
     As though her words were an incantation, Rita froze and stared down at her with, much to Agnes’s surprise, her mouth drooped in shock and her dark eyes brimming with… heartbreak? Now, that couldn’t be right. Agnes was right here, they were married. What was there to be devastated over?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rita’s voice was low, almost timid as she repeated Agnes’s words back to her, “you’re love?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes’s responding smile was a beaming grin, for she was unable to stop the love she felt pounding beneath her breast for this woman from pouring out of her in every way it was possible to express it, “of course you are my love, you’re my whole heart, sweetheart”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rita’s lower lip quivered as slow tears started to drip down from her beautiful eyes. Agnes frowned, suddenly feeling extremely shaken at the sight of her wife’s distress, especially as her upset had been in reaction to the words of love they shared so openly and so often in their marriage. Agnes got to shaky feet, unsure why she was even sat on the tarmac in the centre of town in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rita, sweetheart? What is it? What’s wrong?” Agnes tried to bridge the space between them, arms open, eager to embrace her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet Rita, who had turned towards her with the evident intention of collapsing into them, didn't get to, for a bright beam of scarlet energy suddenly struck her in the chest and sent her spinning through the air to land in a pile of limbs several feet away.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the way she reacted though, it was as though Rita had never been hit in the first place, for she was quickly back on her feet and flying towards Wanda. She raised both hands and started to fire bolt after bolt of green crackling lightning at their neighbour, who managed to block every blazing attempt with a swipe of her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      What have you done to her?!
     </i>
     ” Rita screamed, “
     <i>
      you bring her back to me! Right now!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda threw a wave of energy towards Rita as she hissed from between clenched teeth, “you were both in on this scheme, were you? In it together to steal my power from me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rita hissed, her eyes wide and sparkling manically, “I don’t need to
     <i>
      steal
     </i>
     your power, chaos magic is beneath me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda scoffed, “oh yeah? And what makes you so special?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rita didn’t answer her question, instead she drew a stream of magic into her hand and flicked it out like a whip to wrap around Wanda's ankle before tugging it backwards so the glowing chain would tighten and pull Wanda over onto the concrete. Rita hauled it hard, dragging Wanda back towards where she stood with an orb of emerald energy sparking around her. Wanda hissed in pain as her hands and knees scrabbled hard against shards of rubble and chunks of brick as she tried to fight against the energetic vine hauling her backwards, managing at last to grip the curb's edge and halt Rita's ability to reel her any closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt like the right time to try and diffuse whatever this was, so Agnes stepped between them with a nervous smile stretched across her face, “gosh, you’re both angrier than a pair of hissing kittens,” her brow drew downwards in concern then as she glanced between her furious wife and her seething best friend, suddenly feeling desperately unhappy that they were so upset with one another, “what’s got you both in such a twist, huh? Can’t we sort this out over cocktails?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her intention had been to calm the confrontation down, yet almost instantly, her words had the opposite effect. Because the moment Rita realised Agnes was addressing them both, a ripple of suffering anguish swept across her features as she stared back at her, replacing her anger momentarily and unknowingly gifting Wanda the key to her agony.
    </p>
    <p>
     For in the next moment, Wanda pushed out a wave of scarlet energy, throwing anyone standing in the square off their feet, before swiping a sparking palm  toward her ankle to banish the tendril of green magic still wrapped around it. Agnes, who had also been thrown backwards in the blast, scrambled back to standing, just as Wanda's jeering tone echoed out towards Rita, who was also hauling herself back up into a fighting stance with a manic feral grin slashed across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So it wasn’t all fake huh? You two were actually together before I came here? Actually
     <i>
      in love
     </i>
     ?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rita hissed at Wanda through clenched teeth and drew a wave of speeding air upwards so she could throw it towards Wanda who was forced to brace against its onslaught.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have no idea who you are quarrelling with!” Rita’s voice was a terrifying blend of fury and demand, with a bassy echo that carried even over the rushing noise of power being hurled across the square, “now undo the enchantment you have placed on her,
     <i>
      now
     </i>
     !”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rita honey?” Agnes shouted, trying hard to intervene again, even whilst holding both hands over her head to protect her face from the loose rubble and litter that was now swirling above them all, caught in the storm her wife had... conjured? Somehow? “Why don’t we just go home. We can put on that show you love? The gardening one?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is your
     <i>
      wife's
     </i>
     punishment!” Wanda shouted at Rita, ignoring Agnes entirely. “She plotted this entire thing, she has been lying to me for weeks! She forced me to relive the darkest moment’s in my life!” Wanda’s voice was a violent roar; it was the voice of a broken woman whose only reserve was stemming from the well of anger she held inside. “And now, now the only things I had left in this pitiful world I will have to lose! Because of her! My
     <i>
      husband
     </i>
     ! My
     <i>
      sons
     </i>
     ! My entire
     <i>
      life
     </i>
     ! because of
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     ,
     <i>
      because of all she tried to steal from me
     </i>
     !”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rita rushed forward then as her own fury pushed her closer to Wanda. As quick as a flash, another whip of green light shot from her palm to wrap around Wanda’s throat. Rita tugged her forward, like a curling vine wrapping around the branch of a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rita’s voice was pure poison as she spat out, “you cannot comprehend the horrors I will do to you unless you
     <i>
      fix her
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda didn’t look fearful though in the face of Rita's threats. She didn’t look concerned and she didn’t look cowed. Instead, she laughed, a manic crazed laugh that was promptly reduced to a spluttered choking when the magical vine around her throat started to tighten, squeezing the air from her lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing you do to me is worse than what I will have to do to myself,” Wanda hissed with what air she had left, as her eyes flashed towards the overturned minivan her husband and sons had been sheltering behind since the battle started.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rita tugged Wanda that final foot closer, reeling her closer with the glowing vine that she then replaced with her own clawed hand. With a single tug Rita dragged her closer, until their faces were mere inches apart. Rita’s teeth were clenched and her eyes were wild, reminding Agnes of the kind’s of animals they would watch documentaries on together, all cosied up on their couch, learning about lions or wolves from the Discovery Channel.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next two words Rita spoke were a hissed warning through clenched teeth, a final demand, “
     <i>
      free. Her
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s mouth was bloody from their fight when she grinned up at Rio, her white teeth glistening as red as the magic swirling in her pupils, “no. She needs to be punished”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rita shook Wanda by the throat with one hand as she drew the curved dagger from her belt with the other, yet before she could even try and use it, a cloud of red smoke engulfed Wanda, transporting her swiftly out of Rita’s reach and back towards Agnes who, on realising neither of the women were going to listen to her, had taken cover behind a street bench.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda, honey I don’t know why Rita is so mad, but let me talk to her - I'm sure we can sort this out!” Agnes started to speak the moment she realised her best friend was standing beside her, yet Wanda didn’t reply, instead she grabbed Agnes’s shirt and tugged until her back was pressed to Wanda's front.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey now!” Agnes cried, having had quite enough of whatever had made two normally reasonable women brawl in the street, “now I know you two girls are having a tough day, but there is no need for physical violence!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet once again, Agnes was ignored, for Wanda was too busy glaring at Rita with blazing eyes, who had started taking dangerous strides closer. Strangely enough though, with every step she took her face shimmered, appearing from some angles almost... skeletal?
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t know her wife could do that. Huh, the more you know and all that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda didn’t appear phased either, as she quickly held up a hand to draw a wall of scarlet fire between them, preventing Rita from getting any closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I have just thought of the most fitting punishment for you too,” Wanda spoke loudly, so Rita would hear her over the hum of her magic.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You cannot punish
     <i>
      me
     </i>
     ,” Rita hissed through her bony mouth, an eery sight even for Agnes who loved her with her whole heart, even if she did have some secrets they would definitely be discussing over a bowl of Agnes’s homemade casserole later that night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s scarlet barricade blazed in time with her temper, holding Rita at bay the moment she brandished her own wave of emerald energy and poured it towards the red wall blocking her path.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are an accomplice in her treachery, committed an offence against my family, are a liar, and you deserve to be punished for your crimes, just as she does”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s voice was stern and final, like a judge decreeing a sentence after a long, tiring month in court.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rita didn’t reply with words, only screamed with fury as she started to slash at the wall of scarlet with her curved dagger in desperate, rage-fuelled strokes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, as a result of your deception I will be forced to pull this whole hex down, destroying my
     <i>
      home
     </i>
     , collapsing my
     <i>
      family
     </i>
     , killing my
     <i>
      husband
     </i>
     , and reducing my
     <i>
      children
     </i>
     to little more than atoms. So, you
     <i>
      definitely
     </i>
     do not get to continue living in matrimonial bliss with the woman you love, I won’t allow it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rita’s voice was barely human as she threw herself at the red mirage, her temper so great that the magic holding her back started to shudder and weaken, “
     <i>
      don’t touch her! Don’t you touch her!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her wife's anguish caused tears to pool in Agnes’s eyes, yet the moment she tried to wriggle free, intent on holding Rita and soothing her fears, Wanda's grip on the back of her shirt tightened and she hauled her backwards even harder, just as Rita’s punishment drifted from her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So,
     <i>
      Rita
     </i>
     if that is even your real name,” Wanda spat, sounding disgusted, “this is for you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And with that, Wanda raised a hand from where she had been gripping her tightly to tap a gentle fingertip against Agnes’s temple, causing a single spark of scarlet energy to sink through skin and bone.
    </p>
    <p>
     A shudder ran through Agnes's body and she managed to take a single shaky step forward before her eyes rolled back and she dropped heavily to the floor, aware only of the seething, primal scream that echoed nearby as all went dark around her and the pavement, like an old friend, greeted her once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     The next few hours were nothing more to either Agatha or Agnes than shadowed darkness, glimpsing dreams, and shades of faces, or one face in particular really.
    </p>
    <p>
     Awareness bled back slowly after that as her senses returned to her one after the other, like a polaroid photo gaining clarity as it develops.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hearing was first; the rustle of her own body against soft sheets, a gentle breeze sailing through an open window and causing curtains to brush against one another.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then smell came second; laundry detergent, fresh cut wildflowers, alongside an undercurrent of something earthier, like the scent of dry soil after a rainstorm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Touch followed soon after; the soft give of the pillow beneath her aching head, a hand holding hers, it’s palm rough but ever so gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
     And finally sight, as her eyes cracked open, first only to bleary shapes and merging colours, like the spread of watercolours across a damp canvas, just for everything to sharpen into focus quickly after a few painful blinks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her bedroom was as it had always been, with her television on the wall and her hamper in the corner. Agnes glanced around, taking note of a bunch of drooping, broken-stemmed wildflowers in a vase on her bedside cabinet, before finally focussing on the person sat beside her, who was cradling her hand with her head bowed over it, looking almost like she was praying.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her movement must have alerted the woman to Agnes’s waking, for she looked up the instant Agnes shifted. Immediately, Agnes was met with brown eyes shimmering with unshed tears and a face so pretty it made her inhale sharply. The woman's face crumpled with relief the moment their eyes met, “you’re awake," her voice was strained, rusty from tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes stared at her curiously, allowing her eyes to travel from dark eyes, down the long, elegant slope of her nose to parted lips. After a moment of heavy silence and study, Agnes sat herself up with her free hand and as she smiled timidly at the beautiful woman in front of her, finally found her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not that I’m sorry to wake up and see such a beautiful face looking back at me,” Agnes grinned, feeling shy, “because seriously, did I die and go to heaven, or is that just you hot stuff?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman’s jaw dropped in shock, evidently slightly disturbed that Agnes was bold enough to flirt with her moments after opening her eyes from what she assumed was some sort of concussion? Caused by... something? Maybe a freak accident of some kind?
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman didn’t say anything though, so Agnes was able to continue asking what she had been intending to since she had awoken in her bedroom with this beautiful woman watching over her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But, if I could ask, without appearing rude or ungrateful; who exactly are you? And why are you in my house?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes hadn’t thought it an unreasonable question, nor asked in particularly abrupt manner, yet the way the beautiful woman’s face collapsed in despair did seem like a slight overreaction to her innocent query. Brown eyes flashed the most peculiar shade of green as tears started to drop down over her cheeks. Her lip trembled on a slack jaw, appearing as though she was attempting to speak but had forgotten every word or motion required of the mouth to communicate verbally.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry hon, I didn’t mean to upset you,” Agnes murmured, not quite sure what to do with this overtly emotional stranger in her bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she spoke, the darkhaired woman’s devastated gaze shot up to capture hers and as their eyes locked, Agnes watched with an uncertain frown as the stranger’s distress suddenly transformed into a spitting fury. Her hand tightened around Agnes’s own and her brow dropped heavily over her dark eyes, giving the woman a menacing, threatening aura, making her look dangerous, in fact she looked deadly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, much to Agnes’s surprise, she didn't feel frightened or concerned at having this angry, somewhat feral stranger in her bedroom, she felt merely confusion, over a lot of things in fact. The sensation of which then multiplied twice when the stranger opened her mouth and spoke, in a voice as furious as it was solemn, “I’ll get you back my love I swear it. And then, once I know you are safe and yourself once again, I will find the scarlet witch and she will learn that there are far worse fates than simply dying”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes blinked before a slow, patient smile bloomed over her face, “ah, right… well, that sure sound’s exciting hon. Now, what time is it? Did I miss Jeopardy?”

     <b>
      RIO
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hadn’t been born when time began, it had been far simpler than that. It had been an unassuming transition from non-existence to existence and at first it had been silent.
    </p>
    <p>
     The universe was quiet for a long time, a silent vacuum with naught but a sporadic wave of sound from some distant exploding star, spreading its energy out across the plane of darkness that Death had hewn her robe from.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly though, as more stars died and their matter mixed and their elements curdled, life began.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had watched as microscopic organisms adapted, as bacteria formed, as fungi and plants worked together to leave the ocean floor, as corals appeared, and then fish, and then insects, each one developing over eons of time. Her view had been similar to that of a zoetrope, one that displayed the process of evolution through a sequence of progressive changes, like flickering images flashing from one to the next in sporadic, bumpy, sometimes ugly jumps.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, it wasn’t until humanity had bloomed from the constant turning of time that the point of Rio had then become clear. For the veils of the beyond had fluttered, an ache had started in her sternum and soon she followed that feeling until she took her place as guide; the being responsible for ferrying the masses from one plane to the next in a constant cycle of death and rebirth.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was at that point she had learnt the clinical, black-and-white definition of what it was to have a purpose. But, it wasn’t until she met Agatha Harkness, that the true meaning of the word purpose, of what it actually meant to have something, or rather someone, driving an individual forward, came into sharp focus and she started to understand the
     <i>
      why
     </i>
     of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <i>
      why
     </i>
     of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was her spark in the dark, the breeze that stoked a smouldering ember into a blazing fire. She had kissed Rio’s mouth, exhaled life into Death and in a single instant, everything Rio thought she knew of the universe, the assumptions she had ignorantly made were promptly scrambled and rearranged into a new mosaic, one that revolved around moody blue eyes, dark, wild hair that flowed over proud shoulders, and a pouty mouth that hid a sharp tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, when Wanda had touched a gentle finger to Agatha’s temple and removed every trace of Rio from her mind, Rio had felt that hollow emptiness, the one that she had existed in, quite unknowingly, before Agatha had taught her what it was to be human and set her on fire from the inside out, the one that had tried to drown her when Agatha had run from her, promptly returned. With its maw open and gaping, waiting to swallow her whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a pain beyond comprehension. One she wasn't entirely sure she would survive, which was absurd considering she herself would never know the peace death brought. It was an agony comparable to being doused in oil, set on fire, and left to burn. But without ever actually dying or being extinguished. A consistent, aching, shredding, violent pain that howled from the cavern beneath her ribs where her heart, black and shrivelled as it was, sat.
    </p>
    <p>
     The days following Agatha waking from scarlet magic dissolving all evidence of Rio from her mind were the hardest she had ever lived. And she had existed for all eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been forced to lie, almost immediately, for one thing. Not even given a grace period to comprehend the horror of what had been done to the woman she loved, or the agony of their love having been ripped from Agatha's mind as though it were merely a stray weed growing amongst flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had used her real name, the name Agatha had always known.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm Rio, Rio Vidal… you’re neighbour," she had managed to choke out, hoping desperately that it would spark some sort of familiarity in Agnes's eyes. Yet, she had been met with nothing but dim politeness and that same beaming smile Agnes had been donning since her eyes had opened and asked a question as futile as whether she had missed a particularly bad quiz show.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio Vidal..." Agnes had repeated brightly, "well, ain't that as pretty as a meadow in May. It just rolls right of the tongue, it's beautiful".
    </p>
    <p>
     That first night, Rio had tried to draw Agatha to the surface with her own magic. She had snuck back into Agnes's bedroom once she had fallen asleep, placed one glowing palm against her forehead, the other against her heart, bowed her head and wept. She had sent wave after wave of energy through Agnes's body, hoping to untie the scarlet knots currently holding her mind hostage. Yet, after a few minutes Agnes's eyes had shot open, her pupils had flashed red, and she had screamed herself hoarse, clutching her head between her hands as though someone had stuck a burning poker through her ear and scrambled it around. Rio had tried that a few more times, but after the fourth attempt, when Agnes's body had collapsed from exhaustion once the pain finally subsided, Rio stopped trying to force her way through Wanda's curse. It was clear, after all, that magic alone wasn’t going to free Agatha from this spell.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was fortunate in a lot of ways that the character Wanda had forced Agatha to adopt was laid back and desperately lonely, because now Wanda, the woman Agnes believed to be her best friend, was gone, she clung to Rio's apparent friendship like a clinging vine climbing a tree. That first night, she had insisted Rio stay, first just to wait out her own concussion, then it had been for dinner the following night, then it had been to go to the farmers market the following morning. It didn't seem to even cross Agnes's mind to ask or question why the stranger who supposedly rescued her from a car accident was now practically living with her. But, Rio wasn't going to turn her nose up at a turn of good fortune, although their proximity did cause issues.
    </p>
    <p>
     The primary issue laid at the feet of that familiar darkness waiting to swallow Rio whole. It was always there, waiting and watching, inching closer every time Agatha, or rather "Agnes," glanced her way, with familiar eyes that held no depth, that were as shallow as spring puddles, like Wanda had reached forward with clawed fingers and scooped the very essence of Agatha out from between her ribs, leaving only a muted, poor imitation of the woman Rio loved.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second issue was temptation. Agnes, who at her heart was inspired by Agatha's own traits, including her queerness, was as gay as Agatha and even more flirtatious with it, which was saying something. She wasn't backwards in coming forwards when it came to her own attraction, and fairly soon into her friendship with her new "neighbour," Agnes made it very clear that she would be interested in far more. She would smile at Rio from under her lashes, she would blush whenever Rio entered the room, and she would trace Rio's body with hungry eyes, eyes that were disarmingly familiar and would often cause Rio to double-take, certain that at last
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     witch had returned to her. Although, it was comforting in a strange sense too, because even if her Agatha had been locked away within her own mind and had Rio wiped from her memory, it was clear that her body recognised Rio, or at least recognised it's longstanding attraction to her. It was a small comfort in the labyrinth they were currently lost within. Yet, on the whole it was a complication. One Rio did not need, because all she wanted to do, whenever Agnes would stare at her with those dark eyes, promising her all manner of dirty deeds, was lean into the sensation of being loved by this woman, this woman whose hands she would recognise against her skin in the dark, whose weight was as familiar as the earth's breeze upon her neck, whose lips she had memorised the pressure of. It was the direction Rio's internal compass was set to, to just go to her when Agatha beckoned, like a flower towards sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
     So it was a torture of it's own to deny them both the comfort of a warm embrace and the bliss of a familiar kiss. But she resisted, because Rio knew that it wasn't truly Agatha, it wasn't really the woman she loved. And she knew it wouldn't be right nor fair to either of them to give into the fallacy Agatha was currently being blinded by.
    </p>
    <p>
     They existed within this agonising purgatory for an entire year. And Rio, in between collecting the mounting piles of dead souls from around the world, the one’s who were forced to wait for Death to drag herself away from a small town in New Jersey and finally grace them with her presence, Rio simmered, and she plotted, and she researched, and she kept watch. She would check on Agnes under the pretence of neighbourly concern, which quickly changed into neighbourly friendship, which Agnes was all too willing to indulge her in, whilst occasionally attempting to seduce Rio into neighbourly lust.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, like all monumental moments, which most often occur on the most mundane of days, a wave of scarlet power had exploded through the living room they had been sat in together, causing Agnes to slump forward, unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio jumped to her feet, eager to close the space between them and ensure Agnes was well. Yet, the moment she did so, Agnes awoke, sat up and stared at Rio with a hard, pointed stare, one world’s away from the beaming smile Rio now associated with Agnes. It was the one Agatha would have worn more often if she hadn’t been weighed down by a mountain of grief, the full one where her eyes scrunched and her entire face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes scoffed, “Oh boy, here we go again. Who called the feds in?” Her voice was lower, almost a drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s brows rose high on her forehead, unsure as to what was happening. She played along though, curious to see what had just changed, “I suppose the right answer would be the Chief of Police?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes scoffed and got to her feet, a lolloping stride instead of the dainty, hip-swaying walk Agnes usually used, “the body has been bagged and tagged by my team. It’s in my morgue. You have no right to come storming in here and demand access to a file I haven’t even had the chance to review properly”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, just as Agnes was drawing a chair from beneath the kitchen table in a wide swing, as though pulling a car door open, she slumped forward as a second flood of scarlet magic burst around them both. Rio was quick and caught Agnes’s falling body in a soft cloud of emerald smoke, laying her gently on the couch with a pillow beneath her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     A deep frown marred Rio's brow as she stood over Agnes, who was still out cold. Uncertainty reigned as she waited for her to wake, unsure what she could do to help her witch. She swiped a gentle hand over Agnes’s forehead, trying to see if she could gain any clarity with her magic as to what was occurring, when she suddenly discovered something that made her freeze, something that made hope start to bleed from her black heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because, for the first time since Wanda had bewitched Agatha’s mind, Rio’s magic didn’t spark defensively at the blockade of scarlet power simmering just below the surface of her mind. No, for the first time, it felt as though the door to Agatha’s mind had been left unguarded, as though the usual chains of scarlet energy that fortified Agatha’s mind against any attempts to free her had been loosened and dropped to the floor with a metallic rumble.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time since Wanda had pressed her finger to Agatha's temple, the door to Agatha's mind was
     <i>
      unlocked.
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     Which meant, all Rio had to do was find a way to
     <i>
      open the door
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Hope spread throughout Rio then like the first rays of dawn, slowly at first with only weak beams banishing the shadows before blossoming into a morning of blinding sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something must have changed, something
     <i>
      important
     </i>
     and now the door was unlocked. It would be possible for Rio to explore, to search, and to find the real Agatha, who was still locked up in the depths of her own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     So when Agnes finally awoke, with a different version of herself settled onto her features, Rio was ready and willing to play along, determined now to get to the bottom of this cruel sorcery and end it once and for all.
    </p>

     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The Red Witch was causing problems again, big problems. Herb’s report had told her as much. It had been written there, in black and white, that the Red Witch, or at least that’s what she was called within certain circles, had started asking questions about the parts of the city the feds knew belonged to Agnes, even if they couldn’t prove it. It was a stupid nickname in Agnes’s opinion, a little old fashioned and chauvinistic too, that a capable woman was demeaned by such an archaic term, only to then be further belittled by the colour of her hair. Even if Agnes hated the bitch, she didn't hate her because she was a woman, she hated her because she was a cop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes after all, although on the other side of the law to the Red Witch and her team of bumbling officers, could respect the mettle of a woman who had worked hard enough to make a formidable name for herself, especially in a field predominantly dominated by men.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was rather sensitive to the topic, if truth be told, as it was a bone of contention in her mind and an exceptionally touchy subject. Primarily because, although Agnes had inherited her empire, one built on an array of crimes including, but not limited to, arms sales, money laundering, and hired hitmen, she refused to have the efforts she had put in to ensuring the family business thrived labelled as little more than the result of good luck or nepotism.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes had bled for this fucking kingdom. And she wouldn’t allow a fed, even a pretty fed with green eyes and red hair, to rip it all apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, she had ordered a hit. A neat, tidy one that could never be traced back to her or any of her people. It would require outside help though, someone new who had no ties to her organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the end it had been Phil who had stepped forward and whispered a name into Agnes’s ear when she had summoned her inner circle and demanded they find someone fresh, someone who would be entirely new to New York, let alone the O’Connor family.
    </p>
    <p>
     The name was one she had never heard before, although it would be a lie to say it’s utterance didn’t make a puzzled frown blossom between her brows as a frisson of
     <i>
      something
     </i>
     ran up her spine. It was a name she didn’t know nor could she recall, yet it still felt… familiar. Like she had heard it in a dream and promptly forgotten it upon waking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Vidal?” she had questioned, voice sharp as she sat on the stiff backed arm chair in the basement of the nightclub her family owned, the basement where all of her most important meetings took place.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s the one boss,” Phil repeated, awaiting further orders.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hummed and ran a hand over the back of her dear companion, a white rabbit who she had christened Scratch, “have a meeting arranged. As soon as possible”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right away Ms O’Connor”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The appointment had been organised without complications and the following evening Agatha found herself in the same seat, with the same white bunny in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her henchman were scattered around the room; an intimidating scene which had been their intention. A sharp rap of knuckles against wood soon broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come in,” she ordered. Promptly, Phil opened the door and held it for a woman to enter before him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes allowed her gaze to drift in a lazy meander up the stranger’s body, as a single eyebrow rose with sincere appreciation. She was an attractive woman, very attractive in fact, with dark hair pulled back in a low bun, a pouty mouth, and eyes that held an intensity that might have been hard to look at if Agnes wasn't quite so formidable herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio Vidal,” Agnes stated, not standing to greet her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agnes O’Connor,” Rio replied, her voice a smoky low echo in the quiet room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have heard you are the sharpest shooter on the eastern seaboard,” Agnes allowed a small smirk to grace her face, “so, you had better not miss”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Much to Agnes’s delight, Rio smirked back. It was a bold, confident expression, the type that Agnes rarely had pointed in her direction by her employees.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn’t realise I had even been hired yet,” Rio glanced around then, taking in the details of the basement office, which included a broad oak desk, several filing cabinets, a drinks trolley stacked with ample bottles of liquor, and a small hutch in the corner for Scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk brightened into an actual smile, “is it always like this up here for you? With extras and scenery too? No wonder you always liked to perform. I always said you were an actress born a witch”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes frowned, suddenly lost amongst the waves of confusion thrashing against the inside of her skull, “what are you talking about? Performing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes snapped back to her own and her shoulders straightened, “oh, nothing. I was just thinking out loud. Whose the target?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes’s frown remained plastered on her features for a few moments longer, before the roaring noise in her mind finally settled to that normal familiar hum, “the Red Witch. I need her dead, and I need it done quietly”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face darkened gleefully at the thought, “I’d love nothing more”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes smirked, “that’s wonderful to hear. Now, as far as payment goes, I will pay you half now and the rest once it’s done, and done to a satisfactory manner. I cannot, under any circumstances, have either the feds or the press getting wind of our involvement in this. It needs to look like a rogue hit, or at least like an accident”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Humming in consideration, Rio took several steps closer, until she was stood directly in front of Agnes's chair. It was a clever move, for it immediately put Agnes on a back foot as she was forced to remain seated whilst looking up into Rio’s face; a face that now looked particularly pleased to be standing over her in such a domineering way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Surprise filled Agnes as Rio reached out a hand to run gentle fingers through the soft fur on Scratch's back, causing all of the henchman surrounding them to inhale sharply, for they all knew no one other than Agnes was allowed to pet her dear companion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes felt a jolt of shock zip up her spine, followed closely by a simmering heat. Her jaw dropped to scold Rio for her boldness, but Rio spoke first, halting Agnes's tongue before it got the chance to move.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t think this version is the right one for this, we need something else”.
    </p>
    <p>
     That same flood of confusion roared back to life, causing Agnes to wince at its volume, “what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We need to go again”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dizziness crept upon her now, making Agnes's vision darken and her ears ring, “again?” she managed to mumble.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Again,” Rio ordered in a voice that echoed before everything went dark.

     It had been a long, hard journey but they were finally here and she could not be prouder. Her class of misfits had done it, they had pulled together and finally become the team Agnes always knew they could be.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had designed, if she did so say herself, the ultimate mash-up of Lorna Wu and Stevie Nicks for the kids to perform. It was the perfect blend, and had taken her hours to craft, trying to draw on all of that magical 70s whimsy that both performers exuded so easily.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kids had been thrilled when she had shown them and they had spent weeks practicing to prepare for this moment. Their last rehearsal had gone perfectly, all of them pitch perfect and dancing on beat. Or at least it would have gone perfectly if
     <i>
      she
     </i>
     hadn’t shown up right at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had all been going so well too. Agnes had just dismissed the kids after a gruelling two-hour rehearsal, flapping a hand at them to hurry home and get a good night’s rest, all whilst shouting after them to not be late for the bus in the morning, which she had arranged to ferry them all over to the venue on the other side of town.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once alone, she leant against the piano and exhaled through a happy grin whilst bringing both hands up to cup her cheeks in an attempt to still her smile from widening even further. This felt
     <i>
      right
     </i>
     , it felt like this might just be the year that her team wins, the year they finally beat their rival team; the Scarlet Soprano’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, it was at that exact moment Agnes's evening turned for the worse and her smile slipped from her face. Because as she had turned to collect her bag, she had found instead, her very own nemesis leaning against the doorframe with her arms crossed across her chest and her hip cocked at a frustratingly attractive angle, one that highlighted the deep curve of her hip.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes felt her brow drop into a scowl as she watched the cheerleading coach swagger into her choir room, staring around as though she had never seen it before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whistled, sounding faux impressed, before giggling? Very unusual behaviour from the usually caustic cheerleading coach.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now you have to admit, this is a new low, even for you,” she glanced at Agnes then, her dark eyes skimming up and down her body, “a
     <i>
      sweater vest
     </i>
     ? Really?” Rio snorted derisively.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes felt her jaw lift stubbornly and crossed both her arms tightly across her chest, “better than another red tracksuit. Seriously, do you own any other clothes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swanned closer, running a single finger along the polished wood of the piano that was still set between them as she circled around it, “why? Do you want to see me in something else? Or just nothing at all?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes’s eyes widened in shock, surprised that the cheerleading coach would imply something so licentious. She felt a hot blush spreading up her cheekbones and down her neck as she scoffed uncertainly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What on earth are you talking about?” Was all she could think to say, bringing a hand up to clutch her own throat and hide the flush she could feel burning under her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked and drew closer still, until she was stood toe to toe with Agnes. She didn’t respond right away, taking her time to glance around and take in the staggered seating set to one side of the room to watch performances, the motivational posters stuck to the walls, and the array of instruments resting on stands around the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “When I have you back, I am never going to let you live this one down”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes frowned as a loud roaring started to sound in her mind, as though someone had turned on a blender right by her ear, “huh? When I’m back? Back from where?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk softened into a gentle smile. Her hand lifted and she brushed her fingertips against Agnes’s cheek, “we’re getting closer, I can feel it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The roaring got louder, making Agnes wince. With eyes and teeth clenched from the pain she managed to hiss out a final question, “feel what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s answer resounded through her mind, before it suddenly felt like she was falling and the world around her started to collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Feel you, sweetheart”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Darkness swallowed her.

    <p>
     The tales of old had not lied, when they warned the living that Winter was Coming. It was as brutal and as violent as their forebears had described, freezing entire families in a single night and causing every plant to shrivel and shrink beneath the soil, until all that remained was barren twigs and empty fields.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her Kingdom had been prepared though and their stores were filled with enough wheat and barley to see them through the long months ahead. Her kingdom was well fortified too. It was a simple land filled with good, hearty folk who worked hard through the long days of summer and offered their fealty to the O’Connor name with brave loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was grateful for it, for the Red Queen who reigned over the southern isles had declared war on Agnes’s kingdom and she had been forced to raise the banners and call the men to arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes was watching from the ramparts of her castle with a thick, fur cloak wrapped around her shoulders to keep winter from gnawing on the exposed skin of her throat, as the men below practiced their drills and sparring form. A line of archers were also practicing firing their bows at a line of targets off in the distance, and she felt a thrill of pride run through her at how capable they all were, how willing they were to fight for her and their homeland.
    </p>
    <p>
     A bugle sounded from the gates and Agnes peered over to see who was arriving with enough prestige to warrant an announcement. With such an entrance, she had been anticipating an entire troupe, yet only one person entered, dressed in a thick, emerald travelling cloak with the hood pulled up, hiding their face from view. Driven by her own curiosity, she swept from the ramparts and down the steep, stone staircase to greet the stranger who had just entered her courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You there,” she ordered, once close enough to be heard, “remove your hood”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The stranger did as they were bid and drew it down, exposing the face of a traitor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes hissed as her eyes widened with fury at seeing the woman who had betrayed her kingdom’s trust, who had sold her secrets to enemy rulers whilst stealing her most valuable treasures from the vaults below. “You dare show your face here?” she brandished a regal hand towards the robed woman, “guards!
     <i>
      Seize her
     </i>
     !”
    </p>
    <p>
     They can't have been within hearing range though, for none of the guards moved from their posts to do as she had ordered them to, leaving Agnes pointing a determined finger at Vidal, who tried to cover a snort of laughter with the back of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes felt a scowl tightening her features as she allowed her eyes to drop in judgement over Vidal’s outfit, which was most frustratingly of all, dashingly handsome. She was wearing clothes appropriate for travelling across miles of rough terrain including a pair of thick leather breeches cinched at the waist by a broad leather belt, which had a curved dagger hanging off of it. A white shirt was visible beneath a thick emerald green tunic. She also had dirt smudged across her face and leaves in her hair from where she had slept amongst the undergrowth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m impressed,” Vidal grinned, “this is your most cinematic attempt yet. The ramparts are my favourite,” she pointed then, over Agatha’s shoulder towards the top of her castle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My ancestors built this fortress with stone gifted to them by the old Gods,” Agnes replied, voice haughty with disdain for the woman in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although it was clear her words were not having the impact she hoped they would, for Vidal smothered another guffaw of laughter behind the back of her wrist, “it’s a creative use of the couch, I’ll give you that”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes scowled, “you besmirch my family home after all you have done?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Vidal’s smile slipped, although it didn’t disappear, instead it became almost thoughtful, “all I have done, I have done out of duty or out of love”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Vidal mentioned the word love, Agnes felt her heart clench painfully beneath her ribs, as though it was reaching out, trying to grasp something that felt close, closer than it had in a long while.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Love?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Vidal stepped closer and swept a single hand down Agatha’s arm so she could grasp her hand gently and bring it to her lips, “yes my lady,” she answered, her voice equal measures of solemn and sincere, “love”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A pain erupted then within the heart pounding violently in her chest, suddenly it felt like something was desperate to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes shook her head, trying to shake some sense into it, “I don’t understand, I can’t…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s alright. This was always going to hurt, just keep pushing sweetheart, you’re almost there. We’re so close”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes shuddered as flashes of purple sparked in her peripheral before everything went dark and her castle started to crumble around her.

     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mother’s predictions had turned true the moment the clock struck midnight on her twenty third birthday. For Lady Agnes O’Connor was now officially a spinster, a spinster who was firmly on the shelf and no longer expected to parade around the parlours of London in an attempt to snare a wealthy a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn’t as though she hadn’t received offers. Countless gentleman had asked for her hand; Count Ralph of High Attic, Lord Herb of Walgreens, and Count Dennis of Postalshire had all practically begged for her to be their wife. But she had a secret, one that Agnes shared with only her own beating heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Lady Agnes O’Conner didn’t hold a single ounce of desire for a man, no, Lady Agnes O’Connor wanted a woman. And not just any woman, she wanted one woman in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman in question though, was not a possible suitor. The most glaring reason being her gender, which the entire ton would be scandalised to even hear whisper of. The second most obvious reason however, was the fact the woman who Agatha’s heart pined for so ardently, was a servant. A stable hand specifically, one her family had rescued from the orphanage when she was just a girl. A girl who had grown into a beautiful young woman, one who had the power to make Agnes’s heart beat furiously from just a single glance of those dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     These issues, large as they were, hadn’t been enough to prevent Agnes from admiring her love though, whom she had run down to visit the moment her awful mama had released her from their breakfast table.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning! What a beautiful day it is today!” She greeted loudly the moment she spotted Rio in the stables, sweeping rogue pieces of dry hay and straw into a neat pile in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned to face her, her lips twitching up into an amused grin as she did so. Her eyes though, for some reason, widened in what appeared to be surprise? “Oh, wow,” she mumbled, chuckling lowly beneath her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes frowned, uncertain as to why Rio would be laughing at such a simple polite greeting, “what is so amusing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyebrows rose to new heights as that same smirk remained plastered on her lovely face, “I just wasn’t expecting a British accent this time round, if truth be told. It’s not bad though, bit pitchy in places”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes’s frown deepened, “what on earth are you talking about?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled again before waving a dismissive hand at her, “nothing, nothing. What were you going to say when you came in here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, as though someone had shouted action and slapped a clapperboard in front of a camera, Agnes’s face shifted back into a flirtatious smile, “don’t you remember what day it is? It’s my birthday!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed and leant the broom up against the wall, “of course, of course it is. And did you get all the gifts you asked for?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes drifted closer, taking a step forward for every one Rio took back, “well, my hideous mother got me a few boring books, but there was one thing I wanted
     <i>
      desperately
     </i>
     but have yet to receive”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s back hit the wooden wall of the stables as Agnes drew closer still, “I think you know what that might be”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face flushed heavily and Agnes watched with delight as her pupils dilated, swallowing her irises in their entirety until Rio's eyes were as dark as her hair. Agnes leaned in whilst grinning, intending on
     <i>
      finally
     </i>
     capturing Rio’s mouth with her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only her mouth didn’t meet Rio’s, for Rio, in a moment of panic had sidestepped her kiss and drawn backwards, “We can’t,” she stuttered, stumbling away even further.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes felt a ball of pain well in her throat and struggled not to cry at Rio's rejection, “you don’t want me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, Rio closed her eyes as her fists clenched tightly. She inhaled deeply for a long minute, as though attempting to restrain herself, before finally opening her eyes. Agnes felt her own widen then, for the depths of pain staring back at her was startling, “I want you, desperately. Never, ever doubt that. But I want the
     <i>
      real
     </i>
     you, the you that is locked away deep inside. Let
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     out and then I will kiss you, free her Agnes,
     <i>
      please
     </i>
     and I will give you everything I am and everything I have”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A cracking sound started to sound inside her mind at Rio's words, like someone had thrown a rock at a frozen lake, shattering it’s iced surface and causing large cracks to splinter across it’s entire surface.
    </p>
    <p>
     She brought both her hands up and held her head tightly, trying to keep her skull together for it felt like it was splitting apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on baby,” Rio begged, sounding desperate, “come back to me, please”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t know what… I can’t… what is this… who are y…” was all Agnes managed to grind out between clenched teeth before she was falling and the ground met her with a resounding thump.

    <p>
     It had been months since she had last seen another person. Or, at least since she had seen another living, breathing human being. One whose face hadn’t been swallowed entirely by fungus or tried to inject their filthy, ravenous spores into her skin with their cracked, bloody teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rations had been easy to find when this had first started; every house, apartment, and store had contained at least one thing hidden away that was worthy of searching for. Yet, as the months had passed, food had rotted, survivors had hunted, and soon enough, everything was dwindling.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was food Agnes was searching for now, in this abandoned suburban house in the remains of middle America.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was pitch black, as it was safer to scavenge at night, and silent, as she was trying to remain as quiet as possible whilst pulling out the contents of several kitchen cupboards, hunting for the apocalyptic version of gold: tinned food.
    </p>
    <p>
     A bang suddenly sounded from the floor above. Agnes froze and held her breath, waiting to see if an infected was about to come stumbling down the stairs to try and gnaw on her flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Much to her surprise though, it wasn’t a clicker, it was a woman. An angry woman who was holding a torch aloft, shining the yellow beam right at Agnes, forcing her to squint and raise a hand to protect sensitive eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the hell are you doing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who the hell are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     They both spoke at the same time, the woman demanding to know why Agnes was in her kitchen, whilst Agnes demanded this strangers name.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman’s face dropped, looking morose for some peculiar reason as Agnes’s question settled in the silence between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m Rio. Rio Vidal,” she answered quietly, shouldering through the veil of sadness that had dropped over her all of a sudden, before tilting her chin towards the cupboards. “Why are you emptying the cupboards at…” she checked the clock set on the wall, which for some obscure reason, was still ticking? Even after all this time? “…at 3am”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn’t realise this place was taken for the night. Had to get off the streets though, you know what it’s like out there. Nearly had a nasty run in with a few runners, so thought it best to lay low until dawn”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, absorbing this information slowly before quite suddenly her shoulders slumped and she sighed heavily, looked exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t know how many more times we are going to have to do this”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes chuckled in commiseration, “tell me about it. World’s gone to shit and here we are hunting for canned peaches like they’re a stash of diamonds”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned, “what else can I do? What else can I do to free you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Free me
     </i>
     ?” Agnes laughed, an uncertain sound. The world ending hadn’t exactly been a balm for those with strained mental health and there were many people she had run into who had unfortunately succumbed to the madness of losing everything. It would appear Rio too had surrendered to insanity; she must have lost someone very important to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Taking a few steps closer, Rio flicked the light switch which actually turned on the mains, much to her surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You got a generator rigged up here? I haven’t seen a spark of electricity since the grid went down,” she whistled appreciatively, “that’s damn impressive”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, all of a sudden Rio started to speak in a voice that was double toned, one that reverberated throughout both the room and Agnes's suddenly aching skull, “
     <i>
      enough
     </i>
     . Enough fallacy. Tell me your name”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Frowning, Agnes answered, “...Agnes O’Connor”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      No
     </i>
     . The witch who placed you under this spell is gone. Something has happened to her and the magic binding you has fractured. You are stronger than this, you can break through it. Now tell me, what is your name!”
    </p>
    <p>
     A roaring, cracking sound started to pound through her head as her jaw clenched tightly together, “I told you already! Agnes O’Connor!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me the name of the witch who caused this! Tell me the name of the Scarlet Witch: wielder of chaos! Tell me the name of the witch who has you trapped in this
     <i>
      lie
     </i>
     , in this hallucination!”
    </p>
    <p>
     All she could hear was noise, like the violence emitted from the eye of a storm, when suddenly like a whisper amongst screams, two words emerged.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Wanda Maximoff
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. Good,” Rio encouraged, “yes, Wanda Maximoff did this to you. So tell me, who are you, who did she wrong?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The gale screeching through her mind got louder still, it’s noise encroaching on violent before all fell suddenly silent. Agnes sighed in relief, only to hiss in pain a moment later when a burning started to spread across her skin, as though someone had held a thousand matches against her bare flesh, hoping to scar her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it hot?” Agnes panted, pulling at the collar of her sweater.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked pleased, “that’s it, claw your way out”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agnes pulled her sweater off, then her shirt searching for a relief that never came. Only beneath was a… dress? An old-fashioned dress?
    </p>
    <p>
     She groaned in pain as the heat across her skin continued to bubble.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled the dress off, then a fur cloak? A sweater vest? Another dress – more modern this time, like the sort of thing she might have worn in a nightclub.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had hoped that would be the end of it, but clothing continued to appear, only to be pulled from her scorched skin and dropped in a messy pile on the floor. Purple jumper and slacks; velvet tracksuit; aerobic clothing; on and on it went until at last she stood staring at her own hands, hands now entirely bleached of any colour, standing in stark contrast to the bright colours of the surrounding kitchen and the rainbow of clothing spread across the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Say it
     </i>
     ,” Rio commanded, “tell me
     <i>
      Who. You. Are
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And like a thin sheet of glass creaking under the weight of a rusty anchor, the bindings holding her mind captive snapped suddenly, almost violently as the answer to Rio’s question became clear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flashes of purple, of Salem, of Nicky, of the woods, of the road, of countless covens, of a blurred face with dark hair but unrecognisable features, of a cloaked figure; too far away to see who they might be, span through her mind. Certainty settled and with confident hands she gripped the final lapel of the last dress and tugged, freeing herself from the burning confines she had been trapped in for so long.
    </p>
    <p>
     For she knew who she was, she knew
     <i>
      exactly
     </i>
     who she was.

      AGATHA
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha Harkness opened her eyes slowly. She took her time, relishing the sensation of being in control of her own body once more as a deep sigh left her lungs. When finally, at long last she peered around, taking in her surroundings with narrowed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first thing she noticed was her location; still in Ralph’s house, then.
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced around even further, taking in the open cupboards with their contents spilled out onto the counters below, and her own nudity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Huh,” she said peering down, her voice lightly curious before turning slightly to find a woman with dark hair stood by the kitchen door. She was wearing pyjamas and had her arms crossed tightly across her chest. It was a defensive position, one that contrasted heavily against the desperate mix of emotions swirling in her dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     A flicker of a memory flashed in Agatha's mind as her eyes narrowed to study the woman, who was now quite openly admiring her body, which was still very naked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without feeling an ounce of shame, Agatha crossed one arm over her breasts and leant her elbow on it, then with a lazy wrist she pointed at the dark haired woman, “I know you don’t I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman’s eyes snapped to hers with a desperate hunger, “you do,” she confirmed, voice solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pouted and with narrowed eyes studied the woman stood in her house, when suddenly she remembered. She clicked her fingers and pointed at her, “I’ve got it! You’re the neighbour. Rita? Was it? Is that right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She snorted in amusement, flapping a hand at Rio as though the answer didn’t actually matter as she swept away to collect a silk robe from the hook by the door. She paid little attention to the way the other woman’s posture sunk, as though a burden recently lifted had been dropped straight back down from a great height, causing her to stumble in place.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s Rio,” she eventually murmured, voice husky and verging on broken. Although Agatha, who wasn’t paying any attention whatsoever to the stranger in her house, was already moving on from their conversation, sweeping off to check on Señor Scratchy.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was important after all, following this sort of ordeal, to be met with a familiar face, one who she knew she loved beyond all others. Not a random stranger.
    </p>
    <p>

     <b>
      RIO
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     It came as no surprise that Agatha was harder to corral than Agnes had been. She was naturally more suspicious, more demanding, and her words were a lot meaner too.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had returned from her search for Señor Scratchy in a blur of colourful silk, with the white rabbit safely cradled in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had stopped in place, her flurry of motion halted suddenly on finding Rio just where she had left her, almost as though she had forgotten about her presence entirely and was surprised to see her still stood in that same position by the kitchen door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Er,” she said pointing at Rio with a lazy finger and narrowed eyes, “the front door’s through there...” she then gestured at her like she was shooing a dog away, “you know, ándale”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio inhaled deeply, shoving every fractured shard of her broken heart down into the depths of herself, into that blank, empty place she had once existed. It was necessary, for if she focussed on the loss of Agatha’s love, of the loss of their history, she wasn’t entirely sure she would remain sane.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha frowned at Rio's lack of motion and threw her hand up towards her, as though trying to forcefully expel Rio from the house. Only no magic responded, not a single purple spark. Evidently, Wanda’s magical chains fracturing and finally breaking hadn’t actually given Agatha her magic back. Nor, much to Rio’s despair, her memories.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stared at her hand in horror. Ignoring Rio, she placed Señor Scratchy gently on the floor and rushed to the living room mirror, where she immediately started to drag a finger against her palm and swirl her wrists, amongst all sorts of other magical contortions that, before at least, would have caused purple light to crackle between her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      No, no, no, no
     </i>
     ,” she mumbled verging on desperate as she closed her eyes, centred herself and journeyed inside to where her magic had always resided.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew the moment Agatha felt it’s absence, for she roared furiously through clenched teeth and began to punch the sofa cushions with both fists, as though they had personally wronged her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed and took a step forward towards her frantic wife, “don't worry, we’ll get it back”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s rabid movements jerked to an instant stop as she stared up at Rio with wild eyes through her hair, which was a crazed mess around her face. Her eyes were blazing with unrestrained frustration as a vicious sneer twisted her mouth upwards, evidently on the verge of spewing something ruthless. Quite suddenly though, her eyes widened with intrigue and she snapped her jaw shut before any insults could escape from between her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed then as her shoulders sagged with fatigue. It was reassuring in some ways, for it was clear Agatha was exactly the same power-driven, advantage-taking woman she had always been, only with a single green thread plucked from her mind like an errant mistake removed from a broad tapestry. For, Rio knew where this was going, oh yes. Of course, it wouldn't be Agatha if it didn't. She should have predicted it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get
     <i>
      what
     </i>
     back exactly?” Agatha asked, voice low with devious hope.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, unphased by Agatha’s tone, for she knew all of her tricks, and her treats for that matter, was honest in her reply for there was little point in lying.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your magic. We’ll get it back”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s intrigue was almost palpable. Her eyebrow arched sharply and her eyes flickered down towards Rio’s fists, trying to sense a spark, “you know about magic?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure do,” Rio replied, keeping her answers short and succinct. She was curious to see how Agatha would react to this new development.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh well… that’s certainly good news,” Agatha smirked as her gaze sharpened on Rio. It was a potent thing, to suddenly have the full expanse of Agatha's attention on her again as she drifted closer to ask, “what did you say your name was again? Rita?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt the weight of their lost history drop on her shoulders as she breathed out the answer, hoping desperately it might trigger something,
     <i>
      anything
     </i>
     in Agatha’s mind, some sense of recognition, “it’s Rio. Rio Vidal”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused thoughtfully, as though digesting the words slowly. “
     <i>
      Rio Vidal
     </i>
     ,” she murmured, almost to herself as her eyes glazed slightly, lost in thought. “
     <i>
      Rio Vidal
     </i>
     ,” she repeated under her breath, as though plagued suddenly by a question that didn't have an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes?” Rio prompted, as hope started to grow like a winter blossom between her ribs whilst Agatha pondered the four syllables that her name was built from.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, as quickly as hope bloomed it shrivelled and died, for in the next moment Agatha shook her head as though ridding herself of something nonsensical and smiled at Rio in that particularly spiteful way she had perfected over the years, as though trying to incite another to violence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Which is exactly what she was trying to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why is an upstart witch in my house hmm? Are you one of Wanda’s little lackeys, come to spy on me and make sure I’m still trapped in that humiliating spell of hers?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned, swallowing the painful remains of her own jagged hope. She didn’t deign to reply, just crossed her arms and arched an impatient eyebrow, waiting for Agatha to get this attempt at inciting her to violence over with and out of her system. It wasn’t a surprise really; she was, at least from Agatha's current perspective, simply the first unlucky witch to cross her path since waking from the curse. And Agatha was powerless too, making her even more of a ruthless hunter than she normally was, which was saying something. It made perfect sense that she would try and steal the first spark of magic she sensed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes narrowed when her words didn’t gain a reaction, so she reassessed her prey, glancing down at Rio’s bare legs in her sleep shorts, taking in her rumpled hair. Instantly, Agatha’s eyebrows rose as a lecherous smirk spread across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I
     <i>
      see
     </i>
     ,” she floated closer, “you and me huh? Keeping Agnes
     <i>
      company
     </i>
     , were you?” she studied Rio’s face closely, “well, I hate to break it to you sweet cheeks, but Agnes is gone. She’s D-E-A-D and won’t be coming back”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes then immediately dropped to Rio’s hands, hoping that a harsh reminder of her lost love might startle a spark from her that Agatha could steal.
    </p>
    <p>
     A pained bark of laughter escaped Rio’s throat at the irony of her assumption, “you’re
     <i>
      this…
     </i>
     ," she held up her hand, showing a small slither of space between her thumb and index finger, "…close to being right, but just not quite on the money I’m afraid”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sneered before her lips once again lifted into a sly smirk, having undoubtedly thought of some other devious thread to pull on that might upset Rio enough for her to blast a beam of magic at her chest. But Rio, having had quite enough of this fruitless game cut to the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look, let me set you straight on a few things Agatha”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her stern tone caught Agatha by surprise, who splayed a hand out in a dramatic gesture, implying she should continue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know what you are trying to do, and I know how you work. So, let me say this once and for good; I will
     <i>
      never
     </i>
     , under
     <i>
      any
     </i>
     circumstances, strike you with magic. It’s a closed avenue to you, so you may as well give it up now”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gasped and held a hand to her chest, “moi?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt her lip twitch in amusement at her wife’s antics. She had always been the same, so damn dramatic, “yes,
     <i>
      you
     </i>
     . Nothing you say will anger me enough to ever strike you, so you may as well accept my help and stop trying to piss me off”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes narrowed again, this time in determined curiosity. Rio could tell she had caught her attention now, properly and for good. After all, Agatha could never stand a mystery she didn’t understand and Rio felt a sudden sharp thrill run up her spine at the knowledge her wife's sights were now firmly set on her as a target to chase, as a secret to discover. It felt disarmingly nostalgic, much like it had when they had first met and Agatha had pursued Rio fiercely, killing coven after coven to simply get her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And how is it you know so much about me huh?” she ran a hand through her long, dark hair, stretching her jaw up in a way she knew was devilishly attractive, “a fan of my work are you? Wanted to learn from the best?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn’t stop an endeared smile from stretching across her face, finding simply being with Agatha, of being surrounded by everything that made her wife herself; her
     <i>
      intonations
     </i>
     , her
     <i>
      humour
     </i>
     , her
     <i>
      rudeness
     </i>
     , her
     <i>
      shamelessness
     </i>
     especially after a year of Agnes’s sweetness, so damn comforting. Even if Rio was a mere stranger who had simply caught her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shrugged, “you could say that”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s gaze dropped again, once again skimming over bare legs and skimpy pyjamas, although this time Rio could feel the appreciative heat in her gaze, a warm familiar rush, “you want to help me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A leering edge lifted Agatha’s smile into something dangerous as she swept even closer and placed a warm palm against Rio’s sternum. Leaning closer, she whispered, “and how exactly do you want to help me,
     <i>
      Rio Vidal?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt it then, as Agatha began to try and gain a sense of her power, detecting her magical core through the skin and muscle of her chest to see just how much magic was burning within Rio’s body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, Rio’s magic responded enthusiastically to her touch, as it always had done, causing Agatha to shudder at the intense power Rio possessed. Agatha exhaled heavily and clenched her eyes tightly at the sensation and when her eyes finally flickered open again, her pupils had grown large and dark, eclipsing the moody blue of her iris almost entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lips drew closer to Rio’s, “will you help me Rio? Will you help me find a spark?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their lips brushed softly and Rio felt Agatha’s hands drifting to her waist, her long fingers curling around the gentle curve. Rio felt an agonising shudder ripple through her then, for her desire for this woman was paramount, yet she couldn’t trust Agatha not to try and draw Rio’s magic out from between her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was, way back when, one of Agatha’s favourite ways to drain a witch’s magic from her body. To her, it was a seductive game, one she took great pleasure in winning. Rio knew Agatha after all, better than anyone, so she knew the moment Agatha felt Rio's magic, it's potency would have caught her attention like a predator scenting blood, and that she was now utilising another weapon in her arsenal.
    </p>
    <p>
     One Rio had always been weakest against.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, she also knew if Rio did allow Agatha to kiss her and Agatha, unknowing she was Death, drew her power into her body, it would kill her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Which was incomprehensible.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, with that warning blaring in her mind, Rio took a stumbling step backwards and held both her hands out in front of herself, “I will help you,” she said, voice insistent, “I will help you find a coven to draw from, but it cannot be me. I can’t let you, not from me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Something special, are you?” Agatha’s voice, surprisingly, didn’t sound sarcastic. Instead it sounded sincere, deep with a curiosity Rio knew to be dangerous. Because when Agatha was like this, when she wanted something from someone, even if that something was simply the truth, she became a relentless creature, willing to do anything and everything to draw what she coveted from whoever was withholding it from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t need to confirm Agatha’s statement either. She knew Agatha could feel it in the magic pulsing beneath her skin. After all, Rio wasn’t human and she wasn’t just a witch, she was something else, something more. And Agatha could sense it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Humming quietly, Agatha’s eyes remained narrowed before she span away to fetch Señor Scratchy from the floor. She then turned back to Rio with a broad, devilish grin, “well then, in that case
     <i>
      Rio Vidal
     </i>
     , we had better get ourselves ready. A coven is what I desire, and a coven is what I shall get”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio, weak as she always had been and always would be to the whims of her wife, simply nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     They had both prepared for the day, Agatha in a swirling bustle of motion as she threw every article from Agnes’s closet over her shoulder with disgusted mutterings, one after the other, horrified that she had been wearing them for the past year.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s process was slower, more rooted in practicality, which had always been their dynamic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Its continuity was as comforting as it was painful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Throughout their morning together Rio caught Agatha staring at her on several occasions. Each time with narrowed predatory eyes. It was a familiar look, as it was the one she always possessed when intrigued by something or someone. Although Rio wasn’t entirely sure precisely what it was Agatha was hunting for from her; the truth about how Rio knows so much about her? Rio’s power itself? Or something else, something more... physically satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
     It would be a lie, after all, to deny a heady attraction didn’t still simmer between them. It was as potent as it always had been, if not slightly hotter, which was certainly an achievement, because now, Rio was something new for Agatha to pursue; a new conquest to capture, and her attention was as sharp and as debilitating as it always had been.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, just as they were debating the best way to actually leave the house, because Agatha’s car consisted of a dining room chair taped to a broom and Rio didn’t know how to drive a car, let alone owned one, a loud boom echoed from upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     They glanced at one another, unsure as to who or what had made the noise when another bang resounded down the stairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Someone’s here,” Agatha hissed and within moments Rio shrouded them both in a cloud of green light and transported them from the kitchen to the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their sudden appearance made the intruder jump; a skinny figure with their hood pulled up and a beanie pulled low who had climbed through the bedroom window to rifle through the drawers of the dresser, obviously hunting for something in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey!” Agatha roared, immediately darting forward to try and grab the stranger who was surprisingly nimble. Quickly, they dodged right to avoid her swiping hand before shooting forward to try and clamber back through the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
     He would have escaped too, if Rio, who was quite literally Death incarnate, wasn’t present and with a snap of her fingers drew vines from the air to wrap around his ankles, wrists, and throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     The invader started to gag as the vines tightened, limiting the amount of air he could draw in. Rio smiled in satisfaction at the opportunity to stretch her magical muscles, for they sometimes grew stagnant, causing the pressure in her sternum to build from disuse until she finally had a reason to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt good, too good and she was certain her eyes would be glowing with the raw, unrestrained power she possessed as she flicked her wrist out to throw the stranger into the chair in the corner, drawing even more vines to hold him in place, preventing his escape.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swept closer, passing Agatha who was watching her work with dark, hungry eyes. She knew why; the use of her raw power, the violence, and the ruthlessness of her actions will have hooked even more threads of Agatha’s curiosity. The truth of that thought made her black heart glow golden, for it brought her great comfort to know that even without their history tying them together, Rio was a person Agatha would always be drawn to, that their magnetism and connection was as undeniable as the tides, or the moon, or gravity, and that it always would be.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn’t afford the distraction though, even if Agatha’s hot gaze on her back made her want to spin round and push her up against the nearest flat surface, because she had an intruder to interrogate.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, with that she took one final stride closer and ripped the hood and hat from the strangers head, exposing the face of a terrified teenager.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who the hell are you?” Rio hissed, drawing her dagger to hold under his trembling chin, “and why the hell did you break into our house?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Our
     </i>
     house?” Agatha asked loudly from behind her, before chuckling and muttering, “even as a loser like Agnes I had game”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rolling her eyes at Agatha’s unhelpful commentary and entirely false assumptions, she raised the tip of the blade even closer to the teen’s trembling jaw, “answer me, right now. Or I swear to all of the gods above, I will gut you like a fish”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry!” The boy shouted, face ashen with fear, “I’m sorry, okay, I swear. I was just trying to help!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes narrowed dangerously, “help who?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Help her,” he gestured with a tilt of his head towards Agatha, who dramatically looked behind her as though a third party had been summoned before pointing at her own chest in outrageous shock.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why do you think she needed help?” Rio asked suspiciously, refusing to lower her dagger until some of this started to make more sense.
    </p>
    <p>
     The teen inhaled deeply as though attempting to ground himself before exhaling slowly, “let me start at the beginning okay, I swear I don’t mean you guys any harm. My name is ------- ------ and I-”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swept closer, eyes squinting at him curiously, “try that again”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The teen's jaw wagged uncertainly for a moment before he said with a trembling stutter, “I- I- don’t mean you any harm, I –“
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” she waved an impatient hand at him, “the other thing. What’s your name?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “------- ------”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio and Agatha looked at one another, eyebrows raised in a mixture of surprise and curiosity at the sigil that had appeared over his mouth, hiding his name from them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed once before gesturing with the roll of her hand, “continue”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The teenager glanced between them unsure, before carrying on with his explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have read about you Ms Harkness, and when I tried to visit before… well you didn’t seem well... yourself. So, I did a load of research to free you from the curse you were under”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That doesn’t explain why you broke in here?” Rio snapped, eyes still sparking dangerously.
    </p>
    <p>
     He flinched and avoided looking her in the eye, sensing the danger she exuded, “I needed something personal to do the incantation, something that mattered so I thought jewellery was a safe bet”.
    </p>
    <p>
     He uncurled his fist, which had been clenched tightly in his lap and still restricted by Rio’s vines, revealing Agatha’s Maiden, Mother, Crone locket.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You dirty little thief,” Agatha hissed, suddenly spitting with anger. Her reaction was understandable, for that locket was her most sacred possession. It represented her painful, twisted roots, her escape from her mother’s coven, and most importantly of all; their son. She snatched it quickly from his palm and held it with both fists to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen tried to reassure her again, having noticed how upset she was, “I wasn’t going to keep it! I promise! I just needed something to use for the spell. I’m sorry!”
    </p>
    <p>
     His eyes flickered between the two women stood in front of him and after a short pause, tried for an endearing youthful grin, “I guess I didn’t need to break you free though did I? So, I suppose the right thing to say is... welcome back?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bowed closer to him, eyes narrowed to study his face, “nobody does anything for free though do they? So what is it you wanted from me hmm? What was locked away behind the curse that you wanted to get your grubby little paws on?”
    </p>
    <p>
     His answer was swift, like he had choked it up, for it fell from between his lips with an abrupt eagerness, “I want to walk the witches road!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes widened and Rio watched as her gaze flickered between the teenager in front of her and Rio, who had taken a step back to observe the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The witches road doesn’t exist," Agatha said factually, although her voice was still threaded with intrigue.
    </p>
    <p>
     He rolled his eyes, a motion only a teenager could do quite so effectively, “you’re lying”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyebrows rose at his audacity, “am I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s just what real witches say to keep the amateurs out”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, is it now?” Agatha asked, eyebrows still raised high on her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, confession time,” he grimaced slightly, before chuckling as though embarrassed, “I know an egregious amount about you. I’ve been obsessed since I first read up on your Salem days,” he grinned, “one of my favourite
     <i>
      you
     </i>
     eras, by the way”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked, preening under his adoration, “it’s a good one,” she turned to Rio then with a lascivious smirk, “a
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     good one. You would have liked it, I’m sure”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s heart thudded painfully beneath her ribs as she responded with a weak smile and a weaker nod, attempting to cover the pain currently pulsing throughout her body. As it suddenly felt like she had been stabbed right through the heart, causing the muscle to convulse beneath her ribs as though rebelling against this level of agony.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Rio did like the Salem days, she liked them a lot. After all, she had been there; it was where their story had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s smirk dropped the moment she noticed Rio’s pained response, not out of concern but out of that same burning curiosity she had been staring at Rio with all day.
    </p>
    <p>
     With narrowed eyes, Agatha turned back to Teen, “the adults are going to talk now, we're going to decide what to do with you". She then grabbed Rio’s elbow to drag her from the room and down the stairs to the living room, where their conversation wouldn’t be overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, what do you reckon?” Rio asked, pointing up towards their stowaway, who was still trapped by Rio's vines.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grinned and fluttered her eyelashes, “kid has great taste in idols, that’s for sure”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes, “he should go home to his parents. You’re free from the spell, so the point of him being here is now null and void”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked, “not entirely. He wants to walk the road…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes narrowed then, for she could see yet another scheme had been hatched in her wife’s conniving, brilliant mind over the last ten minutes or so. After all, Agatha didn’t know that Rio knew the road was merely a hoax to trick witches into supplying her with power.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as powerless as she was, it made sense that Agatha would turn back to her most fruitful scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Rio, of course, decided to play along.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But the witches road isn’t real, it’s a myth, a folktale that covens tell to their young before bed”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes sparkled with devious hunger; it was clear she thought Rio close to being hooked on her scheme. Little did she know.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It isn’t a myth gorgeous,” she murmured, voice suddenly low and appealing. Rio felt her cheeks flush at the term of endearment, much to her dismay, “it’s real. I have walked it before. And it’s true what they say, because if you do make it to the end you get whatever your heart desires”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha drew closer to Rio and raised a hand to run her fingers through the ends of Rio’s hair. Her eyes flickered across Rio’s face intently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wonder what your heart desires hmm? Riches?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She pondered that for a moment, “no, no that isn't right. You don’t seem the type to value wealth. How about power?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She raised her other hand and laid it on Rio’s chest, enticing her magic to bubble and simmer beneath her skin at Agatha’s touch, “nope," she hissed in pleasure at it's potent reaction to her caress before continuing, "you have
     <i>
      plenty
     </i>
     of that. Heaps of the stuff. So, it must be that third option your pounding heart covets,” she drew closer, so close she could breath her next words right into Rio’s ear, causing a shiver to run down her spine and across her shoulder blades, “you want
     <i>
      love
     </i>
     . You want to be adored, worshipped completely by another”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She drew back to take in Rio’s expression, smirking in delight on noticing her rapid breathing and fluttering pulse, knowing that she had hit the nail on the head. She had always been exceptionally good at reading people, at finding out what made them tick.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyebrow twitched with intrigue as she stared at Rio's mouth, "and I think too, that you wish to adore in return. To worship another completely as well; an equal exchange of devotion and desire between you and someone else, someone special," her eyes darkened, as she leaned in slightly, "perhaps by one witch in particular?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio jolted the moment Agatha’s lips drew closer and brushed her own. She couldn’t let her, not when Agatha was still clawing desperately for whatever spark of power she could find. Agatha was a loose cannon right now and dangerous in her greed for magic.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re right,” Rio agreed, taking a step backwards, away from Agatha’s body for her own sanity’s sake, “I do want someone, a specific someone,” then in an attempt to lead the conversation back towards the witches road, she prompted, “and you think the witches road will help me find her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's brow dropped heavily, evidently frustrated that Rio wasn’t falling for her attempts at seduction, so with a huff she crossed her arms and pouted petulantly, “yeah,” she flung a hand out, “yeah, the witches road would help you find
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     . Whoever
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     is”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Taming a smirk at her wife’s sudden peevishness she thought it through. The road was fake, Rio knew that much, but what they were after was a coven. After all, there was very little chance of Agatha being able to break through yet another curse to reclaim her memories, especially without her own magic to fight against whatever remaining enchantment was holding her memories of Rio hostage.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made sense. It was the same trick that had served them time and time again. They could use the boy’s innocent charm to lure a few local witches into their scheme, use Agatha’s prestige as the only witch to survive the road as an attractive bonus, gather them all together, sing the ballad, and steal every ounce of magic they possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha would get her spark back and from there they could find a way to restore Agatha’s memories.
    </p>
    <p>
     Concluding to herself that it was the right decision and a solid plan going forward, Rio looked up from staring in thought with her mouth primed to confirm her agreement, that the witches road was indeed a good idea, when she felt her words suddenly stall in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Agatha was staring at her like she had seen a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?” Rio asked, taking a step closer, “are you alright?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried to tame her hope that a flame of recognition had sparked to life within Agatha’s mind but it was not the case, for Agatha quickly nodded, holding a hand up to her own throat in a gesture Rio recognised as one she often did when attempting to self-soothe.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh yeah, I’m fine,” she reassured lightly, before blowing a raspberry and shaking her head, “you just, you just really, really look like…” she clenched her eyes tightly together and waved an impatient hand, “never mind! Anyway!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s heart plummeted into her stomach, because she knew exactly who Agatha had just recognised in Rio’s face. Rio and Nicky had been two peas in a pod after all; it was one of the reasons Agatha had fled from her after his death. Rio's face reminded Agatha of all she had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pain flared but Rio swallowed it down, deciding it was best to just persevere for the time being and redirect them back to their objective; to steal as much magic as they possibly can and regain Agatha's power.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So,” Rio smiled at Agatha and nodded towards the stairs, “we are going to walk the witches road, are we?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s responding smirk was devilish and frustratingly attractive, evidently sponsored by the belief Rio had fallen for her ploy. Slowly, with swaying hips she swept closer to start playing with the ends of Rio’s hair again, “hell yeah we are. But first… first we need to find a coven”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned, the wolfish one that she new always made Agatha’s eyes darken; which they did, almost immediately. It was good to know that some things hadn’t changed, especially after everything they had been through.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Wherever you are, a coven there shall be
     </i>
     ,” Rio murmured, unable to stop her eyes from glancing down towards Agatha’s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the moment she did so, she knew she shouldn’t have.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because Agatha had the instincts of a jaguar scenting blood and the instant Rio’s eyes had flickered down to savour the vision of her mouth, those lips had twitched upwards into a smirk as familiar as it was terrifying.
    </p>
    <p>
     For it was a smirk Rio knew well, too well. It was a smirk that said two words, two words that encapsulated Agatha’s mindset when she found someone she wanted, someone she wasn’t going to stop pursuing, and someone she knew to be exactly where she wanted them.

     <b>
      AGATHA
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s spell had felt, in hindsight, like she was under water; muffled sound, refracted light, weeds wrapped around her ankles to drag her deeper whilst gasping for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the feeling of tightening claustrophobia, but without knowing you were even trapped; a sensation entirely built on feeling and not at all on fact.
    </p>
    <p>
     And even now, whilst finally free from Wanda’s entrapment, she could still feel the sticky sweetness of Agnes’s presence inside her mind, like a residue covering every thought and action. It was a bitter aftertaste, one that still made her shudder and wretch whenever she found herself blurting out something as inane as “okie-dokie,” or “in a while, crocodile,” without meaning to, as if in reflex.
    </p>
    <p>
     These subtle relics of Agnes were not helped at all either when, following her impromptu escape from Wanda's hex, memories from her time as Agnes started to drip feed through into her consciousness, each one randomly prompted by a particular item or a certain phrase. Agnes’s memories were blurrier than her own, shaded in smears of red. It was still comforting though, in some abstract way, to have at least a partial record of what she had said and done whilst not in control of her own body, which was certainly a confounding thing to try and grapple with.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was more, with every memory that resurfaced like air bubbles popping to the surface of a still, dark lake, Agatha’s curiosity started to burn ever hotter regarding one particular person.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because, to put it frankly, things to do with one Rio Vidal were not adding up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like
     <i>
      at all
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha had a nose for fallacy, considering she herself was so good at weaving it.
    </p>
    <p>
     At first she had assumed Rio was just a neighbour Agnes had shacked up with, which had made sense because Agatha was gay as hell and Agnes shared Agatha’s body, so of course Agnes would choose a woman to take to her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, almost as a direct reaction to that one thought flittering through her mind, flashes of countless rejections appeared, one after the other, each one a snap shot from the past year in which Rio had gently and admittedly, rather smoothly, managed to dodge any and all of Agnes's sweet, yet not particularly subtle, attempts at seduction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those particular memories had caused an initial flare of offence, because why the hell wouldn’t Rio want to be with Agnes. Agnes had Agatha’s face and body after all, and she knew the power those parts of her possessed on their own, even with Agnes's measly personality covering her own far more magnetic character. Offence had been promptly replaced by confusion though, because
     <i>
      why
     </i>
     would Rio have been there otherwise? If Rio wasn’t there because she and Agnes were more than friends… then why the hell was she sleeping in Agnes’s house? For a
     <i>
      year
     </i>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     That realisation had then caused even more memories to stream forward in which, nestled amongst the onslaught, was the very first moment Agnes had awoken following that final, humiliating confrontation with Wanda, the one where she had stolen all of Agatha’s carefully curated magic and then shoved Agnes’s horrid personality over her own, like a scratched record that just wouldn’t stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     And much to her surprise and rather desperate curiosity,
     <i>
      Rio had been there too
     </i>
     . Right at the start, bowed over her hands as though Agnes mattered. Which was absurd, because Agnes didn’t
     <i>
      exist
     </i>
     . And if Rio wasn’t there for
     <i>
      Agnes
     </i>
     then she must have been there for
     <i>
      Agatha
     </i>
     but, and here’s the crux of the mystery, Agatha doesn’t know her.
     <i>
      At all
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     She would remember a face that beautiful, she knew that much.
    </p>
    <p>
     Which in itself was a confoundingly absurd puzzle to piece together. Yet, beyond that and perhaps even more absurd still, was the undeniable comradery Agatha felt towards this random stranger almost immediately, this stranger who it turns out was also a
     <i>
      witch
     </i>
     . A witch with a power so potent fizzling beneath her ribcage that Agatha’s eyes had almost rolled backwards at feeling its strength under her palm.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of this was intriguing enough without even mentioning one of the most disarming, and frankly bewildering, points. Which was just how much this stranger resembled her son.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the longer she looked, even more similarities between the two became obvious. for he was there in the curve of Rio's cheek, in the shape of her button nose, the colour of her hair, the tone of her skin, it was all absurdly kindred, it was all so very, distractingly, painfully
     <i>
      Nicky
     </i>
     . So much so that even her
     <i>
      teeth
     </i>
     struck a chord of familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a jarring thing to witness, to see her beloved son’s face in the features of a stranger. And what’s more, the longer she thought on it, trying to piece her thoughts together, much like trying to force a puzzle to reveal it’s image with several of the pieces missing or entirely blank, the blurrier everything felt, as though her ability to focus, to question Rio’s presence in Agnes’s house, and to ponder her confounding similarity to Agatha's son, turned into fog and was suddenly ungraspable.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, with all of these thoughts swirling around her mind and confusing her further, she attempted to internally summarise every piece of information she had gathered and managed to piece together so far:
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      1)
     </b>
     Rio, who bore an uncanny, potentially eery resemblance to her lost child, had been the first face Agnes had seen upon waking.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      2)
     </b>
     She had then stayed beside Agnes this entire time, aside from the occasional business trip which Agatha could recall Agnes feeling particularly melancholy during.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      3)
     </b>
     She had not once been receptive to any sort of physical relationship with Agnes, yet was still here and still willing to help Agatha reclaim her power.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      4)
     </b>
     She knew exactly how Agatha operated, how she stole magic from unsuspecting witches.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      5)
     </b>
     And possibly the most absurd point of them all, even with all of these glaring inconsistencies and whilst covered in countless red flags the size of the pacific ocean, Rio still managed to make Agatha feel frustratingly safe, as though she was a person who Agatha could actually
     <i>
      trust
     </i>
     . Which was a novel experience in Agatha’s long life, that was for damn sure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind continued to consider each one, attempting to coalesce and merge together the known facts into different shaped theories or potential motives, like an internal Rubik’s cube that she was continuously reconfiguring until more of it matched up and started to make sense, as Teen drove them across town on their hunt for a coven.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was sat in the front, having shoulder barged Rio out the way with a loud “shotgun!” The moment they had all started to head towards his old beat-up sedan, that had undoubtedly seen better days about twenty years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     Through narrowed eyes she turned to study the subject of her fascination from over her shoulder, lowering her sunglasses as she did so to the bridge of her nose, so she could consider the other woman and her mysterious motives properly.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was more to all of this, to her, much, much
     <i>
      more
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew that much at least for her instincts, which were never, ever wrong, were crying out loud that this was the case. She was missing
     <i>
      something
     </i>
     , something vital. And she would have bet all the magic in the world that Rio was the key to it all and that she knew far more than she was letting on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha would get to the bottom of it though, she had no doubt about that either. She always did in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, as though summoned by the heat of Agatha’s stare, Rio turned from looking out the window, causing their eyes to meet and gazes to lock.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moody blue on golden brown.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio arched a brow, smirking at Agatha’s review of her, probably because most people, once discovered staring, would look away blushing, embarrassed at being caught. But Agatha felt neither shame or humiliation, nor did she look away, because she, if anything, felt even more determined to discover Rio's secret the moment she saw those distracting lips tick up with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, in direct reply to Rio’s nonverbal challenge, Agatha arched a sharp eyebrow of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Erm, sorry to interrupt… whatever you guys have going on right now…” Teen’s irritating voice rang out, disturbing what was turning into a rather pleasant stand-off, “...but where exactly am I supposed to be heading? Is there like a meeting point? Or a signal we should blare out or something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scowled and slipped her sunglasses back into place before turning with a loud harumph to face the front windscreen again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Wherever you are, a coven there shall be
     </i>
     ,” Agatha drawled, whilst lazily chewing on her thumbnail.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s beautiful,” Teen murmured, as though he found the words profoundly moving.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, it's definitely not,” Agatha disagreed, lip upturned with disdain for his puppy-like sentimentality.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen let go of the wheel with one hand to pull a small notebook from his back pocket, “can you actually jot that down for me? There’s a pen in the glove compartment”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh yeah,” Agatha feigned, pulling the pen from the glove box only to immediately throw it out the window, she gestured for the notebook, “did you want me to take that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no,” Teen murmured, “that’s alri-” his sentence was interrupted though, because Rio reached between the front seats to snatch the spell book from his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hummed loudly, pulling it open to flip through the pages, “ooh, a boys first spell book?” she eyed Teen over the top of it’s pages, hiding the devilish smirk cemented onto her face, “what kind of secret things have we in here hmm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cackled loudly, delighted with Rio’s game as she undid her seatbelt to clamber between the seats into the back, where she landed, quite intentionally, on Rio’s lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey!” Teen yelled twice, first at Rio snatching his spell book from his hand, only to yell it louder a second time whilst pulling on the steering wheel to correct the car’s route, it having been knocked off course by Agatha’s wayward knee.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio jolted slightly at the sudden weight of a body dropping onto her lap, but was quick to wrap an arm around Agatha’s waist to keep her secure in the still moving car.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked down at her, exceptionally pleased that Rio hadn’t just pushed her aside.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Rio's quick reaction affirmed one very important thing in Agatha’s mind, one vital thing she hadn’t been entirely sure of ever since those first few memories had seeped back into her consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because with a single motion, Rio had confirmed that she was at least
     <i>
      attracted
     </i>
     to Agatha. She felt foolish for doubting her own allure if truth be told, because up close like this, Rio’s attraction was as clear as a summer sky. Agatha could see it easily, that familiar heady hunger. It was there in the dilation of Rio’s pupil, in the strong forearm wrapped firmly around her waist, in the possessive fingers digging into her hip to hold her steady, and most especially in the shuddered exhale that fluttered against Agatha’s lips the moment Rio realised just how close Agatha’s face was to her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Well, well, well
     </i>
     ,” Agatha drawled, raising a hand to push an errant strand of hair away from Rio’s face and behind her ear, “fancy meeting you back here, gorgeous”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are all witches this gay?” Teen asked pointedly from the front of the car, “or is it just you guys?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Silence puppy,” Agatha grinned at him puckishly in the rear view mirror, “mummy and mummy are talking right now”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She heard him murmur “ew, gross,” before turning her attention back to Rio, who was still holding Teen’s spell book with the hand not currently gripping Agatha’s hip.
    </p>
    <p>
     She grinned down at her before plucking the book from her hand, “now what sort of magical things does our young apprentice of the craft find extra intriguing hmm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She started to flick through it, exclaiming out loud, “ooh
     <i>
      invisibility
     </i>
     ; now that’s a good one. Hot tip: you have to forgo clothing to make it work, so you had better not overestimate how long it will last, because you could end up in a crowded place in your birthday suit”. She leaned in closer to whisper in Rio’s ear, “I did that once, ended up entirely naked on the deck of the Titanic if you can believe it? You should have heard the gasps of scandal from first class, it was like they had only just discovered tits weren’t mythical”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though, much to her surprise, Rio didn’t laugh as Agatha had hoped she might, instead she grimaced, looking quite suddenly like someone had punched a fist through her ribcage to grab her heart and roughly squeeze it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her eyes narrow at Rio's strange reaction, yet continued flicking through the pages, deciding to file it away amongst all the other odd little behaviours she had noticed since reclaiming her bodily autonomy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Love spells
     </i>
     , Teen?
     <i>
      Really
     </i>
     ? How very licentious of you,” She gasped dramatically, feigning shock before grinning wolfishly, “maybe there
     <i>
      is
     </i>
     hope for you yet”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She saw him roll his eyes at her in the rear view mirror, before turning the page to read the title on the next page.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Communicating with
     <i>
      Death
     </i>
     ?” Agatha arched a brow, as a strange bolt of
     <i>
      something
     </i>
     suddenly fizzled up her spine. Rio had stiffened beneath her lap too, her fingers tightening almost painfully on Agatha’s hip.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t really notice this though, for her mind, all of a sudden, felt blank. Like someone had wiped a thought that had been on the tip of her consciousness away with the ease of rain over chalk on stone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah!” Teen said from the front, unaware of the strange tension that had started to bleed from the witches on the backseat, still focussing on the road ahead, “I found it in this old spell book I bought at an antique thrift store in the city! How cool is that? That it’s possible to actually summon him!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The phrasing, for some curious reason, caused Agatha’s hackles to rise, even through the fog she was currently battling within her own mind, “and
     <i>
      why
     </i>
     is it you assume Death is a
     <i>
      man
     </i>
     ? I took you for a lot of things Teen, but a chauvinist?” She ticked her tongue in disapproval, “I’m very disappointed in you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     He flushed, “oh god, you’re right. I shouldn’t have assumed anything”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Death's probably really old and really ugly,” Rio added, finally starting to relax back into her seat, “and could be like totally covered in nipples”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted, feeling genuinely amused by the woman beneath her, which was a novel feeling for Agatha Harkness who more often than not, genuinely despised everyone, “
     <i>
      nipples
     </i>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and smiled up at her, “who knows? They could be. Or they could be a complete smoke-show”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes locked onto Rio’s and for a fraction of a second, it felt like she was staring at Rio's face in an entirely different place at an entirely different time, for her visage was suddenly surrounded by dense foliage, her hair covered in a rich green hood, her smile anxious, before, in the same amount of time as it had taken to change in the first place, they were once more in the back of Teen’s terrible car.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile faded the longer Agatha stared at her with a confused, befuddled frown, “are you alright?” she asked, the concern clear in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quickly, Agatha shook herself free from the absurd fantasy; undoubtedly the result of residual chaos magic zipping from one synapse to the next. She shot Rio a reassuring grin, “never better hot stuff,” she drawled whilst leaning more of her weight onto Rio, whose breath, in reaction to feeling more of Agatha's body pressed up against her own, shuddered out against the back of Agatha’s neck in a few tantalising waves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked like a cat with a mouse to play with, relishing the effect she was having on Rio as she pointed a determined finger between the two front seats towards a scruffy looking building just off the main road, “pull in up there,” she told Teen whilst grabbing Rio’s wrist, which was still pressed against her stomach, to tighten the hold she had on Agatha's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Glancing down, she winked at Rio before whispering to the flustered woman beneath her, “I smell a witch”.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     “Welcome to the curious,” a wispy voice echoed out, as a figure drifted through the beaded curtain that separated the front of the shop from the personal quarters out back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh
     <i>
      happy days
     </i>
     ” Agatha crowed, adopting a southern drawl; her performance entirely inspired by the pearls and shawl she had stolen from Teen's car. “We are hopin’ for a miracle today, this is my boy Beuford,” she gestured towards Teen before slapping a hand over his mouth to stop him talking, “he doesn’t talk much, he’s got the social anxiety”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She then span towards Rio, who had followed them into the shop only to be immediately distracted by a bowl of potpourri on the counter by the front door, which she was now rifling through to pick out the largest petals to eat like it was a bowl of chips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And this…” she drawled, leaning over to grab Rio’s wrist, drag her closer, and wrap a tight arm around her waist, “…is my dear, dear
     <i>
      friend
     </i>
     Gertrude. She used to clean our pool, every Monday and Thursday, but soon moved in after we lost Beuford’s father, my late husband, Friedrich, god rest his soul”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The witch whose shop they had invaded lifted an amused eyebrow, “you moved the pool girl in after your husband died?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her lips stretching into a wicked grin, “why o’ course. She helps keep everything functioning, don’t you sweetheart?” She turned to Rio and pinched her cheek, dragging her face side to side for a few moments, which Rio just accepted with a placid expression, “she’s not just good with cleaning the pool pipes, she can plumb all sorts of things. She’s good with seeing to the garden too, trimming the bushes and what not”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen feigned retching from behind her, so she drove an elbow backwards into his stomach, “oh sorry darlin,” she cooed over her shoulder when he grunted in pain, “didn’t see you there,” she span back around and rolled her eyes at the grey-haired witch, “he’s just so damn quiet”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other witch's eyebrow remained high on her forehead, as an expression that seemed to be an equal mix of amusement and disbelief appeared on her face. She introduced herself with an airy palm, “Lilia Calderu,” before waving the same hand towards a small round table with a crystal ball sat in the centre, which was set to the side of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia drifted towards the table, cutting an eccentric figure in her cluttered store. Her hair was steel grey, curled tightly and pinned back, with a few loose ringlets left free to frame her face. She wore a brightly coloured jacket, a patchwork piece of clothing that looked well worn and well loved over a flowing shirt and relaxed trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you ma'am,” Agatha simpered, as she led her ragtag group towards the table. There were only three chairs around the table; Lilia took the first, Teen the second, so with a shrug Agatha sat down on the third and promptly pulled Rio onto her knee.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia’s eyes met hers over the table. She smirked knowingly and shot a pointed look towards the woman perched on Agatha's lap, “here because you
     <i>
      miss
     </i>
     your dear husband, are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Enjoying the game and her performance, probably a little too much, Agatha closed her eyes in a mockery of grief and nodded solemnly. “I
     <i>
      am
     </i>
     , I
     <i>
      do
     </i>
     ,” she whimpered loudly and dramatically, inspiring a cackle of amusement from Rio which she silenced with a hand wrapped over her mouth, “but to be quite frank with you, what is top of mind is the location of some gold bars my darling husband Friedrich may or may not have buried in our backyard".
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right well…” Lilia eyed them all, “whose paying?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha elbowed Teen and grinned brightly at Lilia, “he takes such good care of his mama and auntie Gertrude, don’t you sweetie pie?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen rolled his eyes and pulled his wallet from his pocket. He paid for the reading and then immediately struggled to stifle a laugh when Lilia closed her eyes, swept her hands over the crystal ball, and started to warble wordlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face brightened as she too raised her hands towards the ceiling and started to chant loudly in an attempt to try and harmonise with the divination witch. Lilia stuttered to a shocked stop and glared at Rio through narrowed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Excuse me young lady, the art of divination is a delicate practice and requires years of training and a refined understanding of the great beyond”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, totally,” Rio agreed, blank smile set back on her face, which prompted a strangled laugh to escape from Agatha, who was once more surprised to find herself genuinely enjoying Rio’s company; she was turning out to be just as much of a wind-up merchant as Agatha was.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a surprisingly comforting thing to experience and something Agatha could never recall feeling with anyone else; instant harmony with another person.
    </p>
    <p>
     It left her stunned for a brief moment as she stared up at Rio’s face, allowing her eyes to sweep over those frustratingly and absurdly familiar features.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who was this woman? And why,
     <i>
      why
     </i>
     did Agatha know, deep, deep inside herself that she
     <i>
      mattered
     </i>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     “You'll find the gold bars in an old bowling bag at the back of his closet".
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia’s answer jolted Agatha from studying Rio's face, prompting her to throw both hands up in victory, “oh
     <i>
      happy days
     </i>
     ! Thank the lord above and your daddy’s spirit for blessing us with these hidden riches, amen”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gripped Rio’s hips and gently pushed her up off her lap, feeling bold enough to flex her fingers and make the other witch jump slightly from the subtle teasing, “hop off of mama, darlin,” she drawled, “I’ll let you hop right back on as soon as we get home”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you like, not,” Teen sighed, eyes closed with teenage disgust as he too got to his feet before pushing his chair back under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     However before Agatha could reply with something else to scar him for life, Lilia started to speak once more, her tone suddenly solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There’s something else. You’ve been under the influence of another, someone you hurt. They took your agency for an entire year. It’s not the first time your witchkin betrayed you, but you survive in a way few do, in fact it’s why you’re here,” her knowing eyes flickered to Rio as she slowly got to her feet. “Other mysteries surround you now, a puzzle that once solved will provide you with everything you have ever sought,” her gaze darkened, “but I am still
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     interested”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She then turned to Teen, “your bank statement will say ‘Lilia’s Leggings’ but that’s just my side hustle,” and with that she turned and swept back through her beaded curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Lilia
     </i>
     !” Agatha sang, prowling after her into the older witch’s kitchen, “you haven’t even heard the pitch”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio followed, wolfish grin now firmly in place, “it’s a good one too”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia’s eyes swept from Agatha towards Rio and for a moment her gaze froze upon Rio’s face. Her face paled slightly, as though she was seeing something other than pretty brown eyes and temptingly plump lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t need to,” she mumbled, eyes dragging slowly from Rio towards Teen, who was hovering politely by the door before shooting another formidable glare towards Agatha, “what witch in her right mind would join
     <i>
      Agatha Harkness’
     </i>
     coven?”
    </p>
    <p>
     And so it continued, the back-and-forth bartering until they were finally sweeping from Lilia’s shop, having enticed her enough to divine a list for them, a list that without conscious choice, Lilia’s own name had ended up on.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That was amazing!” Teen cried as they headed across the street, back towards his car, “and we got a team roster out of the deal too!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Damn I’m good,” Agatha sighed, pulling her hair from the conservative bun she had drawn it back into before entering the shop. She closed her eyes and exhaled slowly, savouring that familiar sensation of a trap tightening around her prey as she basked in the afternoon sunlight streaming over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her peace was immediately disturbed though by Rio shouting “shotgun!” And barging her out the way to get to the front passenger seat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey!” Agatha cried indignantly before immediately wrapping an arm around Rio’s throat in a headlock to haul her backwards, whilst trying to twist them both sideways so she could get to the door first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin grew delightedly feral when Agatha started to fight back and the moment Agatha attempted to push her away from the door she dropped low to offset Agatha’s centre of gravity, hooked her arm around Agatha’s waist and hauled her up until she was slumped over Rio’ shoulder like a sack of potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah! Put me down you
     <i>
      creature
     </i>
     ,” she growled, starting to pound both her fists against Rio’s back, who responded by striding over to a dry patch of grass on the other side of the road. She then promptly dumped Agatha onto the dusty ground right on her ass, so Rio, now benefitting from a head start, could spin on her heel and sprint back to clamber into the front seat whilst Agatha screamed in frustration at being bested and immediately scrabbled back to her feet in order to give chase.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Guys, we have to gather like two more witches this afternoon,” Teen sighed, already sat in the car with both hands on the wheel and his eyes closed; evidently practicing mindful patience.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ignored him and stormed up to the passenger seat to begin aggressively tugging on Rio’s arm, trying to physically drag her from the car, “you’re lucky I don’t have my magic right now,” she hissed at her, eyes alight with competitive rage, “I’d have you gagged and bound in the back of this car with a single click of my fingers”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, Agatha froze as she watched Rio’s amused grin darken into something wolfish and menacing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, don’t you even
     <i>
      dare
     </i>
     ,” she ground out, stumbling backwards as Rio slowly raised her hand and clicked her fingers causing a burst of emerald smoke to snatch Agatha from the street and deposit her in the back of Teen’s sedan with both her ankles and wrists tied up with vines.
    </p>
    <p>
     She growled at Rio through clenched teeth, struggling furiously against her bindings, “I swear to god Vidal, if you don’t free me right now I will kill you the old-fashioned way with knives and axes and iron maidens and…”.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio, who had picked up Agatha’s sunglasses from where they had been abandoned on the dashboard, simply slid them onto her face with a smug, victorious grin and ignored the continuous stream of threats being thrown at her from the back seat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Better start driving Teen, those restraints will only hold her for about three more minutes, and I think it’s fairly safe to assume she will immediately try and climb up front to fight me the moment she can”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked absolutely delighted as she said this, now peering over her shoulder with a beaming grin to watch Agatha's reaction, whose blazing gaze met Teen’s in the rear view mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
     His eyes were wide with uncertainty; evidently questioning the validity of Rio’s words, which Agatha confirmed by nodding firmly at him as a sharp, feral grin spread across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     And with that, he gulped, threw the car in drive and sped off towards town, intent on finding another witch before the two currently sequestered away in his old beat-up car could cause an accident.

     <b>
      AGATHA
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     They had been in the car for around fifteen minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had spent the time glaring out the window at a tidy shop in the centre of town, a sign declaring itself “Kale Kare” was superimposed across it's front in big bold letters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen had spent the same amount of time glancing between Agatha and said shopfront, waiting for a sign that it was time to exit the vehicle and actually approach the store.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio, Rio had spent the time blooming an array of colourful flowers in her palm to thread through Agatha’s hair, who, much to her own surprise, didn’t mind in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
     when the clock struck the eighteen minute mark, Teen spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are we like… going to go in? Or are we waiting for her to come out here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned loudly in response, an overdramatic petulant sound as she slumped forcefully back into her chair, “
     <i>
      ugh
     </i>
     , why of all the witches in the world did it have to be
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Friend of yours then?” Teen asked, keeping his voice light and airy to disguise the true depth of his curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ha!
     <i>
      As if
     </i>
     ,” she scoffed, although her disdain lost some of it’s power due to the large daisy now being threaded through one of the plaits falling over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, Rio jolted backwards with a hissed, “no fucking way!” This was followed promptly by the car door opening and then slamming shut as Rio scrabbled from the backseat onto the sidewalk; the backseat she had been forcefully dragged onto the moment Agatha’s bindings had fizzled and disappeared, much to Teen's demands they '
     <i>
      stop right now before I crash Mom's car!
     </i>
     '
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey!” Agatha called, perturbed at the thought of losing sight of Rio, which in turn perturbed her further, because she had never in all her long years considered herself clingy before, “where are you going?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She gestured for Teen to follow before rushing out the car to spin in a wide circle, hunting for a flash of Rio's familiar figure amongst the mix of pedestrian’s striding down the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There," Teen said, pointing down the street a good distance, where they caught the tail end of Rio turning down an alleyway that led behind a tired looking Italian restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the hell is she doing?” Agatha growled, speeding after the wayward witch. Yet, the scene she found on turning the corner into the alley wasn't what she had been expecting, although in truth, she wasn't entirely sure what she had been expecting in the first place either. Because on turning the corner, she found Rio firing a beam of green light at the scampering hind of a skinny coyote, who quickly fled from the alleyway with a growl the moment the bolt of magic struck it on the ass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A
     <i>
      coyote!?
     </i>
     ” Teen yelped, “what’s a coyote doing this close to town?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good question,” Agatha murmured, brow heavy with curiosity as she watched Rio’s expression. It was dark and weighted, threaded with what looked like flashes of a temper that was spitting just below the surface, like magma beneath a volcano. Physically too, it was clear she was distressed, for both her hands were clenched and her chest was rising and falling quickly, as though trying to contain her upset with a few deep, cleansing breaths.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You good?” Agatha asked, taking a step closer to tilt her face up, capturing Rio’s gaze, “something you need to share with the class?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes found Agatha’s and like lightning through storm clouds, her fury shattered and worry bled between the fractures.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That mangy mutt is one of the Salem Seven,” Rio’s expression hardened again as she took a step closer to grasp Agatha’s wrist tightly, “they’ve found you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s stomach plummeted at the realisation, “shit,” she hissed through clenched teeth, suddenly feeling exceptionally vulnerable without magic to protect herself with. It was such a disarming sensation, so distracting, she didn’t even think to question how or why Rio even knew about her oldest enemy or the fact they had been hunting Agatha since her Salem days; it was simply a thought lost to the static of her panicked mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Adrenaline started to pump as a new found sense of urgency prompted her to spin in place and start speed-walking back down the alleyway, “come on then losers, no time to lose. Got witches to lure!”
    </p>
    <p>
     And just as she was turning the corner back onto the busy high street, she heard Teen murmur to Rio, “witches to
     <i>
      lure?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio, god bless her heart, strange mystery that she was, simply grinned at him with wide, wild eyes, shrugged blasély and murmured in appeasement, “recruit”.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey! Where do you keep your jade eggs? I’m fresh out of marbles, and my pelvic floor is all over the place!” Agatha entered the shop with a flourish, disturbing whatever spiel Jen was spouting to sell her terrible wares.
    </p>
    <p>
     She strode forward and gestured to the two women she had been close to swindling, “actually, you gals wanna go splitsies on one? Hmm? Anyone? Anyone? Sisterhood of the travelling Kegels?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Glancing between them, she grinned as the two mortal women fled from Jennifer’s shop and Agatha’s insistent presence, “no? no?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She heard the shop door rattle open, then closed. She turned towards Jennifer with a big, fake smile, “Hi Jen!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen stared back, looking particularly displeased to see Agatha in her store, “god, Agatha! I haven’t seen you since I made a really pointed effort to never run into you again”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed loudly, boisterously, “so good!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jennifer matched her energy, smiling with faux interest as she asked, “how are you? Awful?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Unwilling to continue on with what was amounting to be a painful level of small talk, and with what little patience she had for both inane conversation and Jennifer Kale specifically drying up like a puddle in the Sahara desert, she got straight to the point of their visit, “I’m assembling a coven, I need a potions guy. We’re gunna walk The Road”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jennifer frowned and opened her mouth, obviously to say something in opposition to Agatha’s statement, when her eyes drifted over Agatha’s shoulder and widened with shock, “erm,
     <i>
      excuse me! Miss!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned and watched with an amused grin as Jen scampered out from behind the counter towards Rio, who was drifting from candle to candle across the store, lighting them with a green spark from the end of her finger, so she could then dip that same finger into the melted wax to taste the different flavours.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted a laugh as Jen, now in a state of concerned fluster, followed Rio around the store to blow out each flickering flame, all while trying to get Rio’s attention with polite a continuous stream of, “excuse me, miss, these particular candles are not for human consumption, they aren’t probiotic, they’re literally wax!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned then, with a finger still between her lips and cheeks hollowed with suction. She hummed in contemplation before pulling it free with a resounding pop, “this one’s definitely my favourite”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pointed to an orange candle labelled, “spiced banana bread”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay,” Jen nodded quickly with a forced smile, as though trying to talk down an insane person before pulling it out of Rio’s reach. She stared at her nervously, evidently concerned Rio was about to explode from ingesting too much candle wax, “do you feel alright - do you feel sick at all? Should I call an ambulance?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cackled and winked, “don’t worry about her, she’s our third”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s eyebrows rose in disbelief, “our
     <i>
      third?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Evidently she didn’t appreciate the joke, so Agatha sniffed and gestured towards Rio, who had since drifted towards Teen and made him jump by pulling a large spider from behind his ear, as though she were a magician and it was a coin, “she’s our green witch. One of the best”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Who
     </i>
     even is she? I’ve never seen her before,” Jen's eyes widened as she started to shake her head with muted horror at the prospect of walking The Road with Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s…” the question itself was innocent enough and obviously Agatha knew the factual answer it required. She knew she should open her mouth and say, ‘
     <i>
      her name is Rio Vidal
     </i>
     ’. That was the simple answer Agatha knew to be correct, yet the question still caused her tongue to stumble as she stared at Rio, who had since lowered the spider to show Teen, who was now holding out a nervous hand for the long-legged creature to creep onto his broad palm, much to Rio’s evident delight.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s important, alright, very important,” the answer felt right, although it didn’t actually answer Jen’s question, “and really talented. So, just trust me, she’s one of the good ones”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen scoffed, “
     <i>

     As if me trusting you wasn’t absurd enough, you want to walk the

     It’s a dead end.

     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh come on Jen,” Agatha wheedled, “I’m offering you the chance to finally lift the binding spell that has kept you magic-less for the last… what century?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen sidled closer; charming, youthful grin in place and large spider in hand, “you look amazing”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s narrowed eyes remained locked on Agatha's as she agreed, “I know,” before asking suspiciously, “what do you care about my magic?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scrabbled for an answer, gesturing with her hands, “I…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh!” Jen pointed at Agatha's fingers, now as pink as the day she was born and free from the Darkhold’s sinister stains, “you lost the Darkhold, and now you’re powerless and exposed”. A smug smile bloomed on Jen’s face at the realisation, “how far you’ve fallen, witch-killer”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt that hit like a strike to the face but refused to gift Jen the satisfaction of knowing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “As least I’m still a witch,” she shot back as Rio finally joined their conversation, now bored from studying the questionable items Jen was trying to sell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio and Teen's faces swung from left to right as they watched Agatha continue to squabble with Jen, back and forth like a tennis match. Which they did, for several more minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn’t take long though for Agatha to lose her patience and consider this entire attempt a lost cause, “ugh! Have fun healing the healthy!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen didn’t follow her towards the door though, instead he attempted a friendlier, more simpering approach. “Hi. I love your Insta-page by the way. You totally minimized the size of my pores”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen eyed him, “who’s this? Another child sacrifice?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Now that quip hit even harder than the first, causing Agatha to waiver slightly in her anger. However, before she could even exhale a pained breath, Rio swept closer to Jen with a dark expression on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was intense; the incredible change Rio managed to trigger with just a furious frown and a clenched jaw, transforming instantly from curious weirdo to dangerous threat. That simmering potent power she possessed flared too, causing the tips of her fingers to crackle with sparks of emerald light.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You
     <i>
      dare
     </i>
     speak of such things?” Rio’s voice was a violent rumble, like thunder promising the earth lightning was on its way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a flutter in her stomach; at Rio’s evident power yes, but also at actually being defended by someone else, at feeling, for the first time in her life, that she had an ally who was willing to watch her back, who would look out for her and protect her completely. It was a new sensation, one whose warm glow she could feel herself softening toward. A slippery slope, she was sure.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was jolted from her thoughts, which were still a buzzing mix of arousal and confusion, the moment Rio’s hand went towards the curved blade she kept strapped to her belt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sweeping closer, Agatha wrapped gentle fingers around Rio’s hand with the intention of simply pulling it away from the knife, yet the moment Rio felt Agatha’s fingers brush along her own, she turned her hand to capture them, threading them between her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did a double take but allowed the contact. She reasoned that if it was successfully distracting Rio from stabbing Jen, which was the whole point of her intervening in the first place, then she would let it slide. But if Rio’s palm did happen to fit particularly well with her own, and the brush of her long fingers against Agatha’s skin caused a simmer of heat to boil in Agatha’s stomach, well that was her own damn business.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now Rio, violence isn’t the answer,” she tutted, smirking at Jen, “especially toward a woman who has no magic to defend herself with”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s shoulders relaxed the moment Agatha spoke to her and with a gentle tug she was able to pull her backwards, away from Jen. Rio went willingly, only to then stand behind Agatha, hands still linked, and glare at Jen from over her shoulder, much like a muzzled guard dog might.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t hate the feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t get a moment to relish in the uncomfortable expression on Jen’s face from Rio’s behaviour however, because in the next moment Teen grinned in victory and flipped his phone toward Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m really sorry about your recent legal troubles”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a devilishly proud smile stretch across her face then, as she took a moment to appreciate just how quickly Teen had managed to perfect the art of manipulation and relish the comforting heat of Rio's body hovering just behind her own.

     “
     <i>
      Lorna Wu?!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen’s loud exclamation caused a lull in all of the surrounding table’s conversations, as several heads turned to see who had just shouted out the name of a 70s rock star in the middle of the mall's food court.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take it easy,” Agatha rolled her eyes, mouth still full of corndog and soda.
    </p>
    <p>
     He didn’t listen though, continuing to talk at a mile a minute about their intended targets legendary mother, “she wrote the most famous version of the Ballad! My mom went to see her last tour right before she died, RIP.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes again, this time even harder before taking another feral bite of her corndog. She hadn’t realised how starving she was, nor how inane teenage conversation could be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen droned on, “I bid on a limited edition signed LP of the ballad, but it cost-”
    </p>
    <p>
     He was cut off by Rio returning to the table with two trays of food, each one covered in a selection of plates from different food vendors including a bowl of chow mein, a greasy burger and fries, a baked potato covered in grated cheese, a hot dog with relish and mustard, a box of chicken nuggets, and three large drinks of unknown flavours.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha found herself amused again and couldn’t resist reaching over to snag a fry from Rio's tray. She chewed on it for a moment before leaning closer to whisper, so close her lips brushed skin, “you’re a hungry girl, aren’t you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s responding shudder was so slight Agatha wouldn’t have known it had happened if she wasn’t sat close enough to feel it tremble through Rio’s body. She turned her head to stare at Agatha, eyes dark and intent, “
     <i>
      ravenous
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unwilling to break the delicious tension she could feel building between them, Agatha smirked and lifted another fry from Rio’s tray, only this time she offered it to the other witch, “better eat up then”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without breaking eye contact, Rio leant forward and snapped sharp teeth into the fry with far more aggression than a single slither of potato required to be bitten in two.
    </p>
    <p>
     And without the will nor desire to resist, Agatha mumbled a sultry, “good girl,” before immediately turning back toward Teen, who had since slumped in his seat with his head in his hands, evidently trying to ignore the two flirting witches sat across from him.
    </p>
    <p>
     She smirked puckishly, enjoying both Teen’s discomfort and the small growl Rio had choked down following their heated interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though her enjoyment was cut short almost instantly, because out of her peripheral she glimpsed a small, black shadow running along the skirting board of the food court’s balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hissing through her teeth at yet another member of the Salem Seven being bold enough to attempt an approach in broad daylight, she grabbed the box of nuggets from Rio’s tray and swept from their table, “let’s go losers!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, shoved the final bite of burger in her mouth, took another bite of the hot dog, and then grabbed a literal handful of chow mein for the road.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen gestured to Rio’s abundance of empty plates and cardboard containers she had abandoned, “you’re just gunna…” he sighed and gathered up all of the litter, “fine”.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Subtle
     </i>
     she had told them, in fact her exact words were, “for the love of all sin you assholes,
     <i>
      act subtle
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Which neither of them were doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen was stood awkwardly in the middle of an aisle, staring intently at Agatha, obviously awaiting further instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whereas Rio had taken a pair of sunglasses from the stand by the door, slipped them on her face and then continued to stare at Alice from over the top of a rack of clothing, as though the sunglasses themselves had the power to hide her from view.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice, who was at least semi-competent enough at her job to notice they were a strange group worth watching, was still sat on her stool in the corner with a perplexed frown on her face, staring back at Rio who had since started to grin at her, a wide toothy grin that looked more like a wolf flashing its teeth than an actual smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Guys, I said be cool
     </i>
     ,” Agatha sighed with resignation. She looked around, trying to figure out a way to incite conversation with the blood witch, when she remembered the glasses still perched on Rio’s nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Psst
     </i>
     ,” she whispered, trailing fingers lightly over the small of Rio’s back as she wandered up the aisle behind her, “make a run for the door," she whispered in her ear, intentionally close and breathy. A dark grin spread across her face at Rio's responding shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned slightly to smirk at her from over her shoulder, “you want me to commit crime as a decoy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s responding smile was filled with mischief, eyes sparkling puckishly, “you’d do that for lil' ol' me? Commit a little bit of harmless theft?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk deepened, “I'd do anything for you sweetheart”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knew logically that it was only light flirtation, that it was merely an enjoyable exchange between two near-strangers, who quite evidently, found one another attractive. Yet she still couldn’t stop her heart from contracting girlishly at Rio’s words, at her accompanying smile, at simply everything Rio Vidal
     <i>
      was
     </i>
     . Agatha felt, in truth, much how she supposed a moth might when blinded by a glaring light, unable to look away or steer herself in another direction, for the pull of Rio's luminescence was far stronger than Agatha's will or desire to resist.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it was then, just as she was distractedly contemplating the most effective and quickest way to seduce this beautifully intriguing stranger, this mysterious woman who causes chaos, riles tempers, and eases Agatha’s anxiety with a simple smile, Rio’s previous words resounded throughout her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      I do want someone, a specific someone. You think the witches road will help me find her?
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     The sudden memory caused an overwhelming wave of jealousy to swarm her, like locusts on a fresh crop, stripping it entirely and causing her previously amused smile to drop into a scowl as a petulant pout bloomed on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     That wouldn’t do. That wouldn’t do
     <i>
      at all
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn’t have a witch she was feeling rather enchanted and besotted by focussed on another. It felt like a strike of steel against iron, the resounding, echoing, greedy want to have all of Rio’s attention on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, not a want; a
     <i>
      need
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     And it was what she would get, for Agatha wasn’t the type of witch to not get what she wanted. Nor was she the type of witch who felt guilt over taking things that belonged to others, in fact she relished in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as Rio’s eyebrows dropped into a frown of concern at Agatha’s silence, she vowed to herself that one way or another, she would claim Rio Vidal’s devotion for her own; body, heart, and soul. She would accept nothing less, and the other witch in question, the one who Rio evidently felt some sort of distorted, misspent loyalty to, would soon be nothing more than a mere memory, a wisp of a thought on the back of Agatha’s coattails.
    </p>
    <p>
     But first, they had a witch to lure.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go on hot stuff, show me what you got,” she prompted with a nod and a wink, gesturing with a tilt of her head towards the shop doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared for a moment longer, assessing Agatha with a long, steady look before shooting her a toothy grin and sprinting for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was quick, but Rio was quicker. Because the moment Rio reached the door and triggered the detectors to start beeping, Alice put out a foot with the intention of tripping her, yet Rio simply skipped right over it before completing a U-turn, so she remained within the shop. This sudden change of direction prompted Alice to grab Rio’s collar and tug her closer, pulling her away from the door and any chance of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Damn,” Rio whistled, sliding her stolen glasses down her nose to leer at Alice, “you ought to be careful with how you handle your customers lady, some people enjoy this sort of thing”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice grimaced and span Rio in another rough circle, yanking her even further away from the exit, “glasses.
     <i>
      Now
     </i>
     ,” she ordered, holding out her other hand for Rio to deposit them into.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Oh my god
     </i>
     ,” Agatha cried, throwing herself into the fray with a dramatic flourish, “unhand her this instant!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ma’am, she was trying to steal these sunglasses,” Alice said, voice professionally polite but with a hint of reserved frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gasped loudly as Teen stepped closer, arms crossed looking smug, “I mean technically, she never left the shop…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh yeah,” Alice scoffed, “because I stopped her…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Gulliver!
     </i>
     ” A tall man thundered, sweeping in through the other doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sir!” Agatha cried, gripping Rio’s arm with both hands to tug her closer, “this woman just assaulted my fiancé!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who was still wearing the dark glasses simply nodded, “hell yeah she did, and I was only about ninety-three percent into it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gasped, holding a hand to her chest, “
     <i>
      ninety-three
     </i>
     percent?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned and brought one of Agatha's hands to her lips so she could press a lingering kiss to the back of it. Then, whilst staring at Agatha over the top of her sunglasses, she exclaimed “yeah, only ninety-three percent sweetness, I save that final seven percent just for you baby”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyes sparkled as she stared down at Rio, matching smirks on their faces as it became mutually understood, even without words, just how much they were both enjoying acting out the show they were intent on putting on for their captive audience. Much to Teen’s despair, if the loud sigh from behind them was anything to go by.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swooned, “oh honey! You always say the most sweet-darndest things,” she beamed at the irregular circle surrounding them, “did you hear that you guys, that seven percent is just for
     <i>
      me
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Er,” Alice droned, obviously disturbed by the circus troupe that had just driven into her store in a metaphorical clown car, only to start honking their noses to try and get her fired, “you can keep the seven percent, I don’t want it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another dramatic gasp from Agatha as she dragged Rio further away from Alice, “
     <i>
      liar!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ladies!” The tall man interrupted, holding both hands up as though he was a tired principle dealing with bickering teenagers, “please calm down so we can sort this out”. He turned to Rio, “ma’am, did my colleague assault you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure did. Right hooked me and everything”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice started to stutter as her boss turned on her, “No, I didn’t! She’s lying!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re old lieutenant convinced me to give you a shot, but you’ve been nothing but bad luck. You’re fired!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice sighed tiredly, as though given bad news she had been expecting, before sloping off to grab her bag which was still leant against her stool.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What divine intervention is this?” Agatha asked as they followed her from the store, “you’re out of a job, and the three of us are setting off for The Road today!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice turned, brow furrowed with anger, “Wait a damn minute! You guys set me up, so I’d join you on the
     <i>
      witches road?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh
     <i>
      ya
     </i>
     ,” Agatha drawled, as though the answer were obvious, “so, whaddaya say? Up for a journey that will lead you to your heart’s most ardent desire?” Agatha raised her eyebrows up and down, trying to entice Alice to join them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice scoffed, “people like you are dangerous”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded, “agreed. Especially her”. She pointed at Rio, who in her boredom had pulled the knife from her belt and started carving her name into the nearest wall, “but the road?” Agatha prompted, pulling on her plaits.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The road isn’t real, it’s just a stupid song,” Alice scowled, pulling her headphones from her bag to rest them around her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Um, forty million copies worldwide beg to differ?” Teen argued; arms crossed, eyebrows raised.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio span from the wall to say, “Road is real. Agatha’s been there,” before going back to start carving Agatha’s name beneath her own, much to the muttered contempt of a passing woman, who quickly squealed and fled the moment Rio turned to bark at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And back,” Agatha added, shrugging in an exceptionally humble way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice shook her head, still not convinced, “The Road is a myth, it’s a con, a cult”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swept closer, intent on sealing the deal, “yeah? But what if it isn’t?” She stared into Alice’s eyes, eager to drive her point home, “what if you could finally answer the question that has been haunting you for most of your life; what happened to Mommy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice stared back, eyes widening with an old pain that had been dragged up by unexpected hands, in an unexpected place, before sweeping off towards the mall exit, pulling her headphones over her ears to block out any further arguments as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Staring after her with narrowed eyes, Agatha hummed, “she’s a tough nut to smash”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Crack”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Demolish”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both Teen and Rio suggested alternative adjectives at the same time; his tone riddled with concern for Agatha’s violent choice of words, Rio’s the opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ugh! I didn’t even get to give her your address,” Teen suddenly groaned in frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You won’t need to,” Rio said simply, staring after Alice with a stoic blankness, “her and her fiery friend will be back, don’t worry”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen frowned, “fiery friend?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Duh,” Rio shot back, before turning to play with one of Agatha’s plaits, who slapped Teen on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We don’t need her, come on,” she told him, before marching off in the other direction, flinging her hands out at two passer-by's to wedge herself between them and disrupt their pathway, just because she could and she found it funny.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bark of laughter from Rio at her dramatics was just the cherry on the cake.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     The next few hours consisted of Teen rifling through Agnes’s kitchen cupboards, trying to pull together some sort of hors d'oeuvre to offer the other witches, whilst Agatha ascended to her basement, intent on pulling out some of the clothing she had stored away; pre-Agnes hex. It was about time she exchanged these hideous outfits for clothing of a much high calibre.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had taken a few hours to pull together from the jumble of clothing she had collected over the years, but at last she finally crafted the perfect outfit; high waisted pants; the same colour as the magic that swirled in her veins, a white shirt that was practical, comfortable and looked devilishly good, and of course, the pièce de résistance; a coat so beautifully fitted to her figure it looked as though a team of tailor’s had spent weeks ensuring it’s perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it was as she was admiring this incredible invention, an ode to her own excellent style that had not once waived throughout the many decades she had been alive, that she felt another set of eyes on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning to see who was watching her, she smirked at finding Rio’s dark eyes travelling up her figure, evidently admiring her new look too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Enjoying the attention, especially from this particular witch, she span in a circle, “what do you think? Screams ‘
     <i>
      might kill you; will kill you, but you’ll probably enjoy it
     </i>
     ’ right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked as she descended those final few steps, starting to circle Agatha to get a full view of her outfit, “it looks alright,” she shrugged nonchalantly, but her hot gaze confirmed her agreement with Agatha’s opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched her, spinning slowly to keep her eye on Rio. It was a delicious sensation, the back and forth with a witch she had decided to seduce, a witch who she knew wanted her but for some reason was hesitant to give into the heat she could feel building between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those same damn words resonated again:
     <i>
      I do want someone, a specific someone. You think the witches road will help me find her?
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s spine straightened as jealousy engulfed her. Who was this other witch Rio was so damn loyal to?
    </p>
    <p>
     In either case, it didn’t matter. Loyalty had it’s limits and Agatha was determined to unpick Rio's, to hack it apart if she had to, so she could grab whatever devotion continued to pour from Rio and wrap it around herself, tightening her focus on Agatha and Agatha alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     For it was clear Rio's loyalty to this mysterious other had already started to fray, because no witch truly loyal to a lover would stare as hungrily as Rio Vidal did at Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Alright?
     </i>
     ” She repeated, feigning offence whilst stalking closer to Rio who had since stopped circling her, “only
     <i>
      alright?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged again, smirking all the while, “you know how good you look, you don’t need me to tell you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pouted, taking a step forward for every one Rio took back until her back was pressed against the wall, “you don’t think a witch likes to hear it said out loud too?” She reduced what small amount of space was left between them, pressing the weight of her body against Rio's until their lips were a mere inch away from one another, “especially from someone she wants to hear say it, someone she wants to think these things about her”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes darkened and she inhaled sharply, as though taken by surprise at the intensity of Agatha’s body pressed against her own. Agatha sighed in response, intentionally making it resemble a moan. She tilted her chin up slightly so her lips would brush against Rio’s as she spoke, “I see the way you look at me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately Rio shuddered and clenched her eyes tightly, evidently trying to claw together any remaining ounce of self-control she possessed. Agatha smirked, delighting in how easy it had been to mangle whatever fair-weather loyalty Rio felt towards this other witch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I look at you too, you know. Even though you’re a mystery to me Rio Vidal, even though all of the puzzle pieces don’t quite slot together just yet, I look at you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes opened, only to close tightly again the moment Agatha clutched her waist with possessive hands and pushed her harder against the wall, pressing even more of her body against Rio's; until they were thigh-to-thigh, hip-to-hip, and chest-to-chest. Rio’s chin tilted up, as though praying to a god that wouldn’t listen for strength to resist, giving Agatha an unobstructed view of her long, smooth throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Smirking at the advantage she had just been presented with on a silver platter, Agatha leaned in and ghosted her lips up the hot skin, searching for that particularly sensitive area above her pulse, that was currently fluttering like the wing of a hummingbird.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re both grown witches,” Agatha whispered, “let’s stop playing coy and admit we both want this,” before dipping her tongue between her lips to moisten Rio’s pulse point, only to then graze it with her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Fucking hell
     </i>
     ,” Rio hissed, twisting a hand through Agatha’s hair to hold her head in place beneath her jaw, as her back arched away from the wall, trying to get as close to the warmth of Agatha’s body as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lips twitched into a lecherous smile against the skin of Rio's throat; the grin of a predator whose jaws were close to snapping around their prey the moment Rio’s other hand dropped to palm her ass, to grab a handful of it and dig greedy fingers into her flesh through her pants.
    </p>
    <p>
     Allowing a whimper to escape, she felt the flush of dawning victory rise beneath her skin and couldn’t resist, petty, possessive witch that she was, from murmuring a few more heated, jealously-fuelled words against Rio’s pounding pulse, “maybe you’ll find something else at the end of The Road now, someone
     <i>
      else
     </i>
     , someone
     <i>
      better
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A heated groan rumbled from between Rio’s lips, lips that now Agatha had thought of them, wanted nothing more than to claim entirely. With fervid hunger, she dragged her mouth upwards, placing a fluttering of kisses up Rio’s throat, along her jawline, over her chin to the corner of her mouth where she placed a single lingering kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, the moment she tried to capture Rio’s lips properly, the moment she was finally close enough to taste them, Rio jerked backwards, as an expression that resembled alarmed fear flashed across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Shit
     </i>
     ,” she hissed, bringing a hand up to cover her eyes as though trying to block Agatha from view, and therefore remove the object of her temptations from sight too.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the final straw in Agatha’s dwindling patience, who quickly slammed both hands beside Rio’s head to cage her in place, “
     <i>
      why the fuck won’t you kiss me?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grimaced guiltily, as her eyes flickered over Agatha’s face, “I… I kno-”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha refused to listen to anymore excuses, as that same wave of feral jealousy, the one that had struck her earlier at the thought of Rio pining for some other witch, overcame her. An unfounded wave, if truth be told, especially for the length of time Agatha had known her. It was absurd really, the ability Rio had to draw the most extreme reactions from Agatha. It was certainly an element for further introspection; when she wasn’t crowding said witch against a wall, that is.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Who is she?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes narrowed with confusion, evidently struggling to follow Agatha thoughts, that were spinning quickly from one direction to the other, “who is who?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scowled and rolled her eyes, “you know,
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     . The
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     you’re hoping to find at the end of The Road?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh,” Rio drawled, piecing it together in her own mind, although far too slowly for Agatha’s tastes, “that
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Yes
     </i>
     . That
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     . Now, tell me, who is
     <i>
      she
     </i>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed, a long drawn-out frustrated sound. Her eyes glanced up and flickered across Agatha’s face, taking her in with a certainty and an intensity that caused Agatha’s heart to stutter. “
     <i>
      She
     </i>
     isn’t why I won’t kiss you Agatha". Rio chuckled darkly as her hands came up to rest on Agatha’s hips, holding her close. She then leant her head back against the wall, appearing suddenly exhausted, “in fact, she would probably be in full support of me kissing you, would demand, really loudly and obnoxiously too, that I do so right now”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s frown was as heavy as her sudden confusion, “what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s fatigued smile drifted as her eyes grazed Agatha’s features, before finally landing on her lips and staying there, “no, the reason I can’t kiss you, is because I can’t trust you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s head jerked backwards, highly offended, “you don’t
     <i>
      trust me?!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     A smirk was not what Agatha had been anticipating as a response. “Oh, come on Agatha, you know this game, you invented it - you seduce a witch; you absorb her magic through your kiss”. She arched a knowing eyebrow at Agatha, whose jaw dropped in shock, suddenly feeling significantly awed and unnerved that Rio, a complete stranger up to the past day or so, knew so much about her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I- well, I might have done that
     <i>
      once
     </i>
     or
     <i>
      twice
     </i>
     ,” Agatha managed to scrape together as a passable sentence, feeling somewhat chagrined.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled, “exactly. And you, hungry little witch that you are, wouldn’t hesitate to pull every ounce of power out of my body the moment it fizzled on your tongue”. Rio’s voice dropped into a sultry whisper as she leant closer, “and trust me sweetheart, it would fizzle”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heat dropped low in Agatha’s stomach, “I’d just taste it,” she groaned petulantly, “I wouldn’t draw it closer, I swear”. She felt almost wild with frustration; for both a taste of that decadent power and to know the weight of Rio’s body on hers, “I can kiss without killing, it’s a choice”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile softened, into one almost far too endeared for two witches who have only known one another just over a day, “a
     <i>
      choice
     </i>
     I’m not sure you would hesitate to make right now”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please, just kiss me, let me prove it to you. I don’t want your magic, I want your mouth,” Agatha whispered, drawing close again to ensure the exhalation of her words brushed against the sensitive skin of Rio’s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio simply shook her head before leaning down to press a long, lingering kiss to Agatha’s throat, “soon, soon sweetheart, when I can be certain you won’t try and steal what you can’t handle”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She then twisted them around, so Agatha was against the wall and Rio was free to wink at her once and head off for the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha, who was feeling a furious mixture of painful arousal and heated annoyance scoffed loudly and promptly stormed after her, “
     <i>
      can’t handle?
     </i>
     You certainly think you’re something special, don’t you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stopped suddenly on the top step, causing Agatha to almost slam into her. She turned and grinned down at her, a wild look that caused the heat already plaguing Agatha’s body to heighten and tighten painfully, “I know for
     <i>
      a fact
     </i>
     you can’t handle it baby. But don’t worry, I’ll keep you safe, I'll make sure you don’t do anything you’ll regret”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned closer, causing Agatha’s breath to catch in her throat as her eyes focussed intently on her mouth, that damn mouth that continued to whisper dangerous promises.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But trust me and mark my words; I swear I will kiss you Agatha Harkness,” she drew closer still, “I promise to strip you bare, lay you down, and press my mouth to every last inch of you, and then when you're finally writhing beneath me, begging for more, practically feral, only then will I kiss your lips with the certainty you are far too distracted, and far too wild with need to even
     <i>
      consider
     </i>
     the thought of drawing the magic from my body”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio then smiled innocently, span and ascended the final few stairs, disappearing from Agatha’s view, who was frozen in place by the desire burning in her veins like a forest fire after a drought, making her practically incoherent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moments later, she jolted forward, leaped up the final two steps and swung herself around the doorframe so she could yell across the kitchen after Rio, “you could test that theory out if you want?! Give it a go, like
     <i>
      right now!
     </i>
     Lets see if it works?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio, who was already crossing through the kitchen door to the hallway, simply blew Agatha a kiss over her shoulder before loudly asking Teen whether he had hung the greeting sign in the living room wonky on purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha, a lover of challenges and a hunter of prey, couldn’t have stopped the feral grin from spreading across her face as Rio's words resounded throughout her mind. For she would hold Rio to her word, one way or another, she would ensure she kept her promise.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sighed heavily, expelling her unspent desire that would remain unsatisfied for the time being, as she leant back against the kitchen counter. “
     <i>
      Rio Vidal
     </i>
     ,” she murmured, eyes hazy with lustful heat as she stared at the last place Rio’s body had been within her sightline, “
     <i>
      where the fuck have you been my whole life?
     </i>
     ”

     Chapter Notes
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Alright, Alright, Alright,
     </p>
     <p>
      I hope all of you fine folks are well and had a restful holiday period, however you celebrate! I got slightly delayed posting this due to a busy Christmas time filled with way too many mince pies and beating my family at board games.
     </p>
     <p>
      For this chapter, I had to figure out some quirks of the story - primarily how much or how little Rio knows about The Road from the get-go. So I have gone for a teensy pinch of salt and landed in the middle ground. Obviously, she's a primordial being so she isn't going to be duped by it, but at this point she doesn't know how The Road has come to be, or who is responsible for it. She is also having to play along too, because she has also convinced Agatha that she, as just a green witch, knows of The Road but doesn't know the truth of it's origins or how Agatha uses it as a trap for unsuspecting witches.
     </p>
     <p>
      I hope all of that ^^ makes sense! It was a bit of a knot that needed untangling which was another reason this chapter took slightly longer.
     </p>
     <p>
      With all of that out the way, I once again want to thank you for all of your extremely kind comments - seriously, you guys are so sweet, And thank you, of course, for the kudos too! I'm really pleased people are enjoying this story &lt;3
     </p>
     <p>
      Enjoy! xox

     <b>
      RIO
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Much to Rio’s surprise, the three witches they had invited to walk The Road with them did actually turn up at the requested time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen arrived first, her pink couture outfit popping brightly against the terribly dull wallpaper. Lilia came next, quickly swiping a stale hors d'oeuvre from Teen’s tray before exchanging a biting introduction with Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “High priestess,” Lilia said; voice airy, eyes distant.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jennifer Kale; Potions”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lilia Calderu; Divination,” Lilia responded glibly before staring intently at Jen, “you’re bound”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you need a chemical peel,” Jen shot back, expression haughty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was third to arrive, notifying them all of her presence with a deep sigh and a forlorn, “this is never gunna work”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen, who looked thrilled to see her, probably because she was the youngest witch to join their ranks and closest to his own generation, exclaimed brightly, “Alice! How did you..?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She swaggered closer, looking around at Ralph’s horrible furniture and the collection of witches stood in a makeshift circle in the living room, “I’m an ex-cop – that’s gunna be the answer to a lot of questions”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who had come skulking in after Rio with her neck and chest still flushed from their tense exchange in the basement, and who had spent the entirety of their new coven’s initial introductions boring holes through Rio’s clothing with the heat of her stare, quickly snapped back to reality with a shake of her head and a single firm clap of her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, gang’s all here. Let’s hit the road!”
    </p>
    <p>
     She started to storm towards the basement with a dramatic flick of her coat, leading their temporary coven through the kitchen whilst throwing Rio a loaded stare over her shoulder as she did so, who simply smirked in response and dropped back even further to walk beside Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You got cuffs on you too, copper?” the question was innocently posed, but she knew victory was hers the moment Agatha’s shoulders tightened and lifted half an inch towards her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice gave her a sideways look, “might have. Whose asking?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned like a wolf and held out a hand, “Rio Vidal. Big fan of all instruments of torture; big or small”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Frowning as though she had just discovered a strange mould growing in her fridge and was uncertain as to how it got there, Alice accepted Rio’s handshake, “you’re a very strange person, Rio Vidal”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blushed, “thank you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice shook her head in amused disbelief, taking the lead through the doorway and down the stairs towards the basement.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn’t take them long to assemble in a circle following Teen’s expulsion from the basement. However, the moment Agatha chimed the bell to indicate they should actually start singing The Ballad, Teen appeared once again at the top of the stairs with a nervous, “erm, Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      What?!
     </i>
     ” She growled, purple feathers ruffled at being prevented from capturing the magical sparks she was coveting so ravenously, and
     <i>
      so very
     </i>
     close to stealing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry to intrude but…” he called out, “…someone knocked on the door… and she's refusing to leave; something about garbage day and your trash cans not being put out for the past four weeks”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha threw her hands up in exasperation, looking around at the other witches as though they all shared in her level of frustration at the interruption, “tell her to go to hell, I’m busy”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen cleared his throat, “er… she’s already inside… and standing right beside me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agnes O’Connor
     </i>
     ,” an aghast voice drawled. It possessed a heavy New England accent, and sounded very much like a disappointed mother overhearing her child saying something inappropriate at a family holiday party.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled and watched as the vein on Agatha’s forehead appeared; a sure sign she was on the edge of screaming a furious tirade.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Mrs Hart!
     </i>
     ” Agatha ground out through clenched teeth; straining to sound as sweet as apple pie whilst closing her eyes to gather her own patience, “I didn’t realise it was you dear!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Two sets of light footsteps echoed down the stairs as Teen led their neighbour further into the basement. He rushed a quick, “sorry!” Before fleeing back up the stairs before Agatha could throw something at him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs Hart looked around, polite smile in place as she took in the circle of unusual women gathered in the basement.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you having a party?” She asked, voice lilting joyfully as her curious smile grew. She was covered in dirt, with a large floppy hat on her head and a gardening apron tied around her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who had always felt a mild sense of kindred rapport with the neighbour who loved flowers, the same neighbour she had shared several conversations with over their garden fence throughout Agatha’s time as Agnes, trading gardening tips and gossiping about the neighbours, subtly held a hand behind her back to blossom a sunflower with a swirl of her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mrs Davis,” Rio said, using the woman’s real name to sooth any possible offence caused by Agatha faux pas, “we are having a party of sorts and would be honoured if you joined us”. She then presented the flower to Mrs Davis, a warm smile on her face. Rio’s voice was gentle, soothing. It was the tone she used on frightened souls recently turned to calm them down, to make them more open to being led through that final flickering veil; an object of abject terror for the majority. She felt a surge of genuine warmth the moment Mrs Davis reached out with a hesitant hand to grasp it’s long, green stalk as though she didn’t quite believe the bright bloom was actually for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my!
     <i>
      Rio Vidal!
     </i>
     ” She gasped, voice draped with genuine joy, “what a beautiful flower! Thank you!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes caught Agatha’s over the top of Mrs Davis head, who had bowed her neck to sniff the yellow petals; even though sunflowers were not famous for a particularly strong or sweet-smelling scent. Agatha arched an unimpressed eyebrow at her; whether it was at Rio presenting another woman with a flower after their heated conversation earlier that day, or frustration at having to deal with the delay of the interaction she wasn’t entirely sure.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio, who always enjoyed Agatha’s darker moods and her wife's temper, simply shot her a subtle wink before turning to introduce Mrs Davis to all of the other witches stood waiting with varying levels of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mrs Davis; this is Jen, Lilia, and Alice,” she gestured to each of them as she listed them off, before waving another hand at the short woman beside her, “ladies, this is Mrs Sharon Davis, she’s our neighbour and a fellow green witch; she has the greenest thumbs this side of the Atlantic”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each of the witches nodded a polite greeting or murmured a quick hello as Mrs Davis grasped hold of Rio’s elbow and pointed the sunflower at her in jovial accusation, “a green witch! Ha! Well, aren’t you the charmer today. I will admit it’s been a wonderful year for azealia blooms in my garden, so much so even I wondered if I had planted magical seeds instead of the standard brand from the garden centre. But a green witch! Now that is quite the compliment!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Using the grip Mrs Davis had on her elbow, Rio gallantly escorted her to join their circle, “here Mrs Davis, join us. We were just about to get the party started, weren’t we Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs Davis frowned and looked between Rio and Agatha, who was stood with the twitching impatience of a bird of prey hovering on the wind above an unsuspecting mouse, “Agatha? Whose Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia barked a laugh, “surprise, surprise.
     <i>
      Agatha Harkness
     </i>
     has pulled a fast one on her neighbours”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s responding smile was as sharp as a razor. She chose not to answer Sharon’s question nor Lilia’s jibe, instead, she simply glanced around the circle with that false, forced grin and nodded eagerly at everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right, well… now that everyone is here, we can
     <i>
      finally
     </i>
     begin,” and with that, she rang the bell, sounding a single chime and started to sing, '
     <i>
      seekest thou The Road to all that’s foul and fair…
     </i>
     '
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone harmonised with the ease of witches who had spent hundreds of years chanting with sister witches, mothers, and covens. It was an old tune after all, and to sing it together felt like a throwback to simpler times, when women would sing together whilst completing laborious chores in an act of feminine unity in the face of an oppressive world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even Rio, who wasn’t human and hadn’t experienced the prejudice of men nor religion, felt her arms dapple with goosebumps as Lilia’s soprano threaded and drifted between Jen and Alice’s smooth alto’s and Agatha’s husky melody. Even Mrs Davis, who would only recognise the tune from Lorna Wu’s universally beloved rendition of The Ballad, was bouncing eagerly and joining in on the chorus as the song lifted towards it’s climatic ending.
    </p>
    <p>
     The change in the atmosphere was apparent as magic began to swirl around Ralph’s house. Rio sang quietly, eyes absorbed, focussed only on Agatha who was always at her most captivating when performing just as she was at that present moment, hands holding tightly to the witches she was intently persuading to
     <i>
      believe
     </i>
     , to
     <i>
      believe
     </i>
     in the lies the lyrics told so prettily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could tell her own pupils were dilated as a heady thrum of anticipation grew in her stomach at the thought of Agatha capturing these witches sparks, of watching, at long last, her wife do what she does best and deliver bodies unto Rio’s alter as purple power swirled around her body once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew too that Agatha could sense her excitement, because as that final note tolled out into silence, their eyes locked and Agatha’s cheek twitched upwards into a subtle smirk; a smirk that radiated arrogant understanding of just how attractive she was, and just how enraptured Rio was with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence remained between them all, heavy and still for a few lingering moments, as the other witches held their breath’s, awaiting the arrival of a door Rio knew would never appear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio continued to stare at Agatha, watched her glance around hungrily before forcing her slight smirk to fall and adopt a mask of annoyance instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Huh, some feedback for you, it did not take this long last time,” she jeered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, if she wasn’t so pitchy,” Jen threw at Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia sneered, “says the voice flatter than a pancake”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The arguments and bickering grew from there, as witch sniped at witch and Agatha stood centre stage mixing their irritated unrest as though they were a soup and she their chef.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood and watched the show with an eager, wolfish smile on her face. Sharon attempted to make peace with a cordial, “well, I thought we sounded great”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, a loud bang resounded from the floor above and even quicker than it’s echo trembling through the floor, Rio sensed a shift in the magic surrounding the house as an undercurrent of genuine malice started to bleed through the brickwork and cement.
    </p>

     ,” her voice cut through the squabbling, intent as she was to warn her of the change in the atmosphere, like a storm brewing on the horizon drawing close both hard and fast. Agatha’s eyes lifted to hers,  Although she misinterpreted the intensity of Rio’s attention and assumed she was demanding her focus due to an inability to restrain her attraction, for Agatha simply winked at her before turning back to the others. The others who were all still arguing over whose singing had offended The Road so badly it was refusing to be conjured.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are there any real witches in the house? Because all I see are has-beens and could’ve-been’s”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia bristled, “you recruited us!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I was a fool,” Agatha’s voice became deeper, adopting an affected tone that Rio knew meant she was closing in on her prey, “you can forget the Witches Road. I’d
     <i>
      die
     </i>
     before letting you
     <i>
      befoul
     </i>
     it with your
     <i>
      noxious mediocrity
     </i>
     ”. She glared at them all, dragging her eyes up and down their bodies as though judging their worthiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What a team of rejects,” she scoffed, before focussing on Lilia to spit, “coward!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Jen, “fraud!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Before finally aiming for Alice with a hissed, “disappointment!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt her focus tear between watching the sparks simmer around the palms of clenched hands and trying to strain her ears to discover what was happening a floor above, where she could hear Teen scrabbling around as though he had disturbed a nest of rats.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed again, “I’d say you should burn like the rest of them, but that would be a waste of kindling”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Enough!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You need to shut up!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go to hell!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Make me!
     </i>
     ” Agatha jeered, hands flexing greedily for the power she could taste on the air as each of the witches reacted just as she desired them to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet Lilia crying for them to “wait!” was a sudden, unexpected change to the scheduled proceedings. “This is a power grab!” She warned the others, having sussed out Agatha’s scheme; the first witch to do so in hundreds of years, “she
     <i>
      wants
     </i>
     us to attack her!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha simpered an overtly false, “
     <i>
      what?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia continued; her voice sharp and her words pointed, “you brought us here hoping our
     <i>
      proximity
     </i>
     , coupled with your
     <i>
      cruelty
     </i>
     , would get you a spark you could steal. You had no intention of bringing us on The Road!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s not my fault only a true coven can open the door!
     <i>
      Heh!
     </i>
     ” Agatha shot back, not her best work Rio could admit, although what little patience Agatha had clawed together snapped moments later as another loud bang rang out from upstairs. Teen’s shrieks became louder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I don’t have time for this! Just
     <i>
      blast me you bitches!
     </i>
     ” Agatha thundered; teeth clenched tightly together.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is that?” Mrs Davis voice rang above the others for the first time, inciting silence as she pointed to a glowing door that had appeared beneath their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Was that there before?” Jen asked, as they all took hurried steps backwards off of the wooden slats.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Alice breathed in reply, staring down at the newly appeared door as though doubting her own senses.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Holy shit,” Rio breathed out, squatting low to run an exploratory hand over its surface as her eyes shot up to capture Agatha’s, who was staring back at her; pale faced and genuinely shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gawked at her, suddenly feeling as though the game they had been playing as allies had suddenly changed without her knowledge, that Agatha was now on an opposing side of the board with all of the pieces hidden beneath her coat.
    </p>
    <p>
     How could this be? The Road wasn’t
     <i>
      real
     </i>
     , it never had been.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Unless
     </i>
     … unless Agatha had
     <i>
      lied
     </i>
     to her?
    </p>
    <p>
     Which wasn’t exactly out of the realm of possibilities for her wife, especially as The Road’s inception occurred after Nicky died and Agatha would have eagerly tormented Rio with lies just for the sake of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stared back, eyes widening with something like panic, though she was promptly distracted by a loud rumbling that started to echo around the basement. Teen’s voice became louder as he skidded down the stairs with a terrified, “
     <i>
      Agatha!!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, he sees the glowing door and hauls it open, “is this it? Is this The Road? Because we should really,
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     go,
     <i>
      like right now!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Several feral howls start to echo down the stairs, prompting each witch to take their chance following the teenager into the strange, glowing portal rather than tackle the robed, feral witches who had just broken into Agatha's house. One of which had started to crawl down the stairs after Teen, a horrifying screech erupting from her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     After all of the other women had scurried down the stairs after Teen, Agatha looked between the trapdoor and Rio, her jaw swinging with uncertainty for a brief moment before glancing over her shoulder to see the shrouded woman clawing her way closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Evidently, Agatha was in complete shock that The Road had somehow manifested, yet was still intent on pretending that had been her goal this entire time. After all, she still didn’t know Rio knew the truth about its origins.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly a clawed hand swiped at Agatha’s ankle, in reaction she grabbed Rio’s wrist and dragged her down the stairs. Together they swung the trapdoors shut just as the feral witch’s horrifying face appeared over the entrance; showing them her rotten, cracked teeth and the depths of lunacy in her veiled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another rumble vibrated throughout the floor and with a final stiffening crack, stone replaced wood. The door was gone; they were sealed in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio halted Agatha’s attempt to continue down the stairs with a firm hand on her elbow, “turn's out you weren’t kidding," she prompted with a hitching tone, maintaining her act of ignorance, "I can't believe The Road is actually real". She made her voice sound breathless, riddled with shock, as she tried to entice Agatha to give away something,
     <i>
      anything
     </i>
     about this twist Rio had not been expecting. Which was certainly saying something for a primordial being.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused, her eyes dragging across Rio’s face. Her brow suddenly furrowed as though she was staring at a puzzle that was missing a single piece, a piece she couldn’t find, before she lifted a hand to drift light fingertips across Rio’s cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Truly uncanny, even more so in this light,” Agatha murmured to herself, evidently distracted again by Rio’s similarity to their son.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?” Rio prompted.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shook her head suddenly, as though waking from a trance, before focussing more intently on Rio’s imploring expression, “I don’t kid about anything gorgeous,” she winked, “
     <i>
      ever
     </i>
     ,” she added before turning to descend the stairs and follow the others into the glowing unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     The strands of truth that Rio knew to be fact were becoming tangled far quicker than she had ever anticipated. And the truth that had just been revealed; that some form of The Road did indeed exist, became the equivalent of a large knot at the puzzles centre.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind spun as she followed Agatha down the stone stairwell, her dark hair shining under the blue glow that was emitting from between the large roots that surrounded them, out into a foggy woodland, one with a central pathway running in a winding route onwards between scraggly trees and large swathes of moss. A full moon was shining in the distance, lighting their way and illuminating the others who had huddled together a few metres from the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost instantly, alarm bells started to sound in her mind causing her to draw closer to Agatha, not wanting her to roam far from her sights. After all, she might be a primordial being, immortal and unable to die, but Agatha was still mortal, even if she was a witch. She pulled Agatha back into the shadow of the large tree the stairwell had drilled down into, preventing her from moving away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This place feels off,” Rio said quietly, needing to warn Agatha of what her senses were picking up; which put simply, was the land surrounding them screaming at her, as though it were being stretched from what it should be into something else, something obscure. But she had to warn her in a way that wouldn’t alert Agatha to the truth either; that Rio knew The Road was a fallacy. She could tell though that this place was false. After all, she had a solid grasp of what realms existed, what realms didn’t, and what realms simply
     <i>
      shouldn’t
     </i>
     . It was her job, not that Agatha knew that right now, and she knew without any doubt that whatever world they had stumbled across wasn’t as it seemed, and that danger wasn’t far away. “The air tastes weird and I can’t feel the tree roots beneath the soil. It feels...
     <i>
      wrong
     </i>
     . Did it feel like this when you walked it before?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded, glancing around at the entrance hiding them from sight, “I know, it’s a strange place,” she sighed out the lie with ease on a ragged breath, “but, and hear me out here, what if this is the chance we both need”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at Agatha as that potent spark that always glimmered in her wife's eye whilst in the throes of a con started to twinkle in the dusky light, “what if this place is the answer to all our problems”. She held out a palm as though it represented the trail they had discovered, walking two fingers of her other hand across its flat surface. “What if, at the end of this path is a prize so valuable it’s worth risking
     <i>
      everything
     </i>
     for?” She clamped her hand around her own fingers, imitating capturing something tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a step closer to Rio, now in full persuasion mode; a particularly attractive side to her wife, even if Rio was biased. “
     <i>
      I
     </i>
     could get my powers back tenfold, and
     <i>
      you
     </i>
     …” her eyes scanned across Rio’s face as she lifted her hands to gesture towards her, “
     <i>
      you
     </i>
     could have
     <i>
      anything
     </i>
     you desired,
     <i>
      anything
     </i>
     at all”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s heart clenched hungrily at the possibility, even as her mind wrestled with the cold, stark facts.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Road doesn’t exist, or rather it
     <i>
      shouldn’t
     </i>
     exist. And yet, here they were. On The Road. So, what does that
     <i>
      mean?
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     Was it actually possible? Was it an option to walk it, to claim the prize? Was it possible to walk The Road, reach the end and then utilise her winnings to gain Agatha’s memories back? Could she restore her wife’s mind in its entirety, filling in every blank space, dot every I, cross every T, and reassert herself within the fibres of Agatha’s grey matter, right where she belonged, where Rio had grafted for centuries to reside?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a desire so acute she felt a sharp rush of excitement pulse within her veins at the idea, at the thought of Agatha, at long last, remembering who Rio was, exactly who they were to one another, and how entwined their lives actually were like ancient roots twisted together beneath the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s smirk lifted before Rio nodded, having read the agreement in her expression before she had even confirmed it within her own mind. Agatha turned then and headed off towards the others, although she let her fingers trail across Rio’s stomach in bold familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio paused a moment to gather her thoughts, to sort them through, for they were all screaming around in her mind vying for attention and making her, for once, actually miss her incorporeal form, for energy cannot think, it can only be, and she had discovered the more familiar with humanity she became, the far noisier and far more chaotic her thoughts became too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Glancing around she reaffirmed what she already knew, The Road wasn’t real, not entirely at least. But, it was here, so that would imply that the prize at the end was here too. And if passing a few trials and playing a few games meant she could restore Agatha’s mind, she would do so. But she would remain vigilant, especially toward her wife, who she knew, better than most, would happily hide game pieces from her in order to gain whatever jackpot Agatha could sense waiting at the edges of this strange place.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio!” Agatha called, hailing her attention towards their small troupe, each of whom had removed their shoes and were awaiting her company.
    </p>
    <p>
     She swept closer, removed her own boots, and took her place beside Agatha to lead them all into the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     The Road, or at least it’s inception, turned out to be much of the same. Almost like one of those old-fashioned rolling sets, where stagehands out of view of the audience, would pull on levers and draw the scenery along in the background. It’s repetitive staging and overuse of both mist and eery lights struck a nerve of familiarity in Rio. It felt
     <i>
      staged
     </i>
     . As though, someone, somewhere, had designed it for a film or a television show.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest of the coven didn’t seem to find it quite as inauthentic though, as each of the witches, aside from Agatha, would jump and shriek at every flickering shadow or tree branch groaning in a breeze that smelt horribly synthetic.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had only been on The Road for around fifteen minutes and had already bickered over what had chased them, what could be found beneath the streets of Westview, what Mrs Davis actual name was, and the pressing matter of analog magic versus pure power – which was still an ongoing debate.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know,” Teen drawled, “labour-intensive, manual acts of magic. Witchcraft – emphasis on the craft”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen, evidently having had quite enough of Teen’s sass, threw out a hand towards him, “again… who are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m ------- ------”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen, Lilia, and Alice all recoiled in surprise, before Lilia’s mouth lifted in a half amused, half curious smirk, “well, I’ll be. Someone’s put a sigil on that boy”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A what?” Teen asked, sounding concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
     All eyes flew to Agatha as Jen accused, “looks like Agatha brought a sparkly little mystery with her”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia joined in, “she was probably trying to keep him all to herself,” her sharp eyes focussed on Rio then, who up to this point had taken to jamming her knife into the bark of a nearby tree, trying to strip it away to see what was hidden beneath. She didn’t truly believe it was a tree made of actual wood, and was determined to discover the truth of its creation; whether it be foam or perhaps rubber? “Him and the other freaky mystery she has brought along with her; a woman without a future to read, nor a past to decipher”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes narrowed as she glared at the older witch from over her shoulder, her stabbing motions halted in place by the sharp accusation in Lilia’s tone. She tugged her knife from the tree and sauntered closer, “excuse me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia bristled and raised her chin, “don’t act coy with me, you’re practically a walking shadow. I can’t get a single read on you, and we both know that’s
     <i>
      exactly
     </i>
     how you like it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A feral smirk blossomed on Rio’s face as she drew even closer to Lilia, raising her blade beneath the other witch’s chin to draw her face up so Rio could look her in the eyes properly, “why don’t you take a closer look
     <i>
      witch
     </i>
     ,” Rio hissed, “perhaps draw a card and see what the deck divines?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha promptly grabbed Rio’s elbow and tugged her backwards, although the hungry curiosity burning in her eyes made it clear she had been tempted to let the fight continue, especially if it meant she could discover Rio’s secrets. Her voice was appeasing though as she addressed the others, talking them down and insisting that all their hearts could ever covet would be found at the end of The Road.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet she was stopped short when it became apparent Sharon was missing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The others immediately spread out to look for her, each of them calling her name or a variation of her names. All except Agatha who swept closer to Rio with a frown line branded between her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was an expression Rio recognised, one that implied she was getting frustrated at not knowing something, that a mystery she had once found enticing had started to taste bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No more games, tell me who the hell you are?” Agatha whispered harshly. Evidently, Lilia’s accusations had piled atop all the other unfinished sentences Rio’s presence caused in Agatha’s perforated mind, becoming unbearable and causing her patience to snap.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a step closer and lifted a hand to cup Agatha’s jaw, she swept her thumb along her cheekbone, savouring the softness of her wife’s skin, of feeling the warmth of her body beneath her palm before answering her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am someone who would do anything for you Agatha Harkness, anything you desire of me, anything within my power to provide will be yours”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s jaw dropped in surprise at the clear devotion in Rio’s tone and words. Her pupils dilated too, no surprise considering how much she enjoyed being worshipped.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Anything at all?
     </i>
     ” Agatha whispered, drawing closer whilst repeating Rio’s words back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Anything
     </i>
     ,” Rio vowed; voice earnest and entirely reverent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s clawed hand shot out and gripped Rio’s collar, hauling her closer, “you’re a
     <i>
      liar
     </i>
     ,” she hissed, as fury once again sparked beneath the lust Rio had stoked to life in her heated gaze. “Earlier I asked you to kiss me; you
     <i>
      refused
     </i>
     . And now I am asking you
     <i>
      who the hell you are
     </i>
     , and you
     <i>
      still
     </i>
     haven’t provided me with an answer to my question”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s body remained relaxed, unphased by Agatha’s aggression even as her tirade continued. This flare of anger had been expected, her wife wasn't infamous for her patience after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So at least do one of them; tell me the truth, kiss me on the fucking mouth, or explain what Lilia meant by ‘
     <i>
      you’re practically a walking shadow
     </i>
     ’. Just stop lying, stop pretending to
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     know more than you do, because I
     <i>
      know
     </i>
     you have answers Rio Vidal, if that even is your name”. Now Agatha had started to rant, it would appear she was unable to stop, as even more frustrations started to pour from between her lips, lips that were now only an enticing inch away from Rio’s own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me why the fuck you were there the moment I woke up as Agnes, but I have no idea who the hell you actually are? Tell me why you stayed for the entire year? Why you refused to
     <i>
      fuck
     </i>
     Agnes even though she was throwing herself at you, even when you told me earlier today how you want to lay me down and press your lips to
     <i>
      every last inch of me
     </i>
     ? Tell me how you know so much about me? How you know about my gift, how I can draw other witches magic into myself and make it my own? Tell me
     <i>
      how the fuck
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      why the fuck you look like…
     </i>
     ” Agatha suddenly gasped in pain and clutched her head between her hands. Her eyes and teeth were clenched tightly together to manage the agony she had started to writhe with, even as she continued to stubbornly try and speak, “like… like…
     <i>
      fuck!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?!” Rio said, voice urgent, tight with worry. She grabbed Agatha’s arms with her own the moment she swayed forward, holding her upright and supporting her weight as her knees gave beneath her. Her eyes were still shut tightly together.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      How- how-
     </i>
     ” Agatha stuttered through the pain, determined as she was to keep throwing her observations at Rio, “how can it be? How do you look like
     <i>
      him?
     </i>
     And how can I
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     know who you are if you have
     <i>
      his
     </i>
     face?!
     <i>
      It doesn’t make sense?!
     </i>
     And it fucking
     <i>
      hurts
     </i>
     to even think about it! To even ask myself
     <i>
      why?!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     She yelped as scarlet light started to spark around her head, shimmering over the skin of her temples and making her dark hair appear auburn. Whatever magic Wanda had inserted into Agatha's mind was starting to heat up with all of these unanswered questions, like a piece of machinery overheating whilst in use, as it tried to desperately block every single one of Agatha's synapses that questioned Rio’s presence and tried to link what Agatha had discovered since waking as herself to what her mind knew to be true, even if those truths were shrouded by the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was clearly causing her a lot of pain though and the moment she opened her eyes and Rio saw they were glowing scarlet, a resounding pulse of fear swept into her stomach at what possible damage could be being done to Agatha's mind from a spell overreacting like this and to such confounding stimuli too.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Who
     </i>
     are you? Who the fuck are
     <i>
      you
     </i>
     ? Who are you to
     <i>
      me?!
     </i>
     ” Agatha started to question, eyes glowing red, scarlet sparks growing brighter around her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, you need to stop!” Rio ordered, dragging her hands down Agatha’s arms to grip her wrists, to try and shake her back to normal, to force her from this avenue of thought that was hurting her.
    </p>
    <p>
     But her wife, stubborn creature that she was simply continued to demand answers, even through clenched teeth and a harsh trembling caused by the agony she was experiencing, “
     <i>
      why do you look like him?
     </i>
     Why do I feel like my fucking body, down to my actual
     <i>
      cells
     </i>
     recognises you? What did Lilia
     <i>
      mean
     </i>
     ? Just tell me the truth, tell me the truth, please for the love of all sin, just tell me the fucking
     <i>
      trut-

     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shut her up the only way her body knew how to. It was a risk, because Agatha was still without power, still volatile and vicious, but Rio had to trust that the mysteries Agatha was demanding answers to would be enough to stop her from trying to drain Rio’s power through her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took a stilted moment for Agatha to recognise it was Rio’s lips upon hers that had silenced her, but the instant she realised exactly what was happening, she groaned into Rio’s mouth and wrapped eager arms around her neck to pull her close and keep their bodies pressed snugly together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hands dropped to Agatha’s waist, flexing into the curve of her body. She swallowed a whimper the moment she felt Agatha’s tongue sweep over her bottom lip, an order to allow her entry; not a request. Weak as ever to the demands of her wife, Rio’s jaw dropped and Agatha claimed her totally, emitting a husky moan the instant their tongues met, and a spark of Rio’s magic danced between their lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately, it would seem Rio’s gamble paid off, because Agatha didn’t start to syphon her power, instead she simply chased the taste of Rio’s magic with her tongue, swiping it deeply into Rio’s mouth in a possessive, primal motion that caused Rio to jerk their mouths apart in order to remain in control of herself. “
     <i>
      Fuck
     </i>
     ,” she hissed, staring at Agatha through lust-hazed eyes, taking note of her gaze too, now clear of any scarlet sparks but dark with hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t get a moment more to try and realign her senses or gasp in another breath however, because Agatha grinned at her, like a wolf might grin at a hare, and roughly grabbed her around the neck to fuse their mouths back together. She then started to take forceful steps forward, pushing her body weight against Rio’s to back her into a tree, which she landed against with a hearty thump and a strangled, "
     <i>
      umph,
     </i>
     " which Agatha swallowed greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now this, this was familiar. Agatha’s writhing body at her front, the press of bark to her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I
     <i>
      knew
     </i>
     you were special,” Agatha mumbled against her mouth, as though unaware she was saying her thoughts out loud, “I
     <i>
      knew
     </i>
     you were different". Dragging her teeth down Rio’s throat, she mouthed at and then bit down hard on a tendon straining beneath Rio's skin as she arched her face away to give Agatha better access.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      You have no idea
     </i>
     ,” Rio managed to hiss out between clenched teeth, as her hand swept up to cup one of Agatha’s breast over her shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned at the contact and arched her back, pressing her chest more firmly into Rio’s palm, “
     <i>
      tell me
     </i>
     ,” she demanded between lingering kisses to Rio’s throat, “
     <i>
      tell me everything
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt herself weakening in the face of Agatha’s fervent demands, demands hissed out between ravenous lips that were pressed against her hot skin. Maybe it would be easier to just come clean? To tell her the truth of their past? Agatha would believe her, surely she would. Especially when she considered the fact it was Agatha herself who had made the connection between Rio and Nicky, like a thread of gold connecting them together in her foggy mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made her want to weep, the fact their son, their darling boy, was once again tying them together, having done so throughout the centuries, throughout the grief of losing him, throughout arguments, and fights, and now even through this damn hex. He was their constant, the one thing that they had never denied connected them, even whilst Agatha had been running away from Rio, whenever their paths had crossed it was thoughts of Nicky that would soften her wife towards her for a short while, long enough to grant Rio a kiss, or an embrace, or on rarer occasions her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, just as her jaw trembled open, partially in reaction to Agatha nipping at the thin flesh above her pulse and partially to finally broach the truth; that they were married, that they shared a son who they had lost, that Rio was Death, that she had been forced to lead him away from his other mother, his other mother who had never forgiven her wife for doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
     A voice rang out from between the trees; it was Mrs Davis, “help me! Getting lower, witch-people!”
    </p>
    <p>
     They didn’t spring apart at the interruption, neither of them too worried about the fate of their neighbour and certain that the other witches would get to her first either way. Instead, their lips met one final time, like old lovers greeting each other in the same breath as bidding a heartfelt farewell. It wasn't just a meeting of lips, it was a meeting of hearts, of souls. It was a kiss that said quite simply, ‘
     <i>
      I have, at last, found you. I won’t let you slip away again
     </i>
     ’.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled through a sigh when their mouths finally separated, her eyes closed with the simple pleasure of reacquainting herself with Agatha’s kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha playfully tugged on a loose lock of Rio’s hair, prompting her to open her eyes again, “come on,” she ordered through a knowing smirk, eyes glowing with a mixture of lust and that everlasting curiosity for answers, answers Agatha knew she was even closer to gaining. “Lets go see what beast’s maw Mrs Hart has fallen into”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand dragged down Rio’s arm to link their hands together before leading her off towards the gaggle of witches they could hear arguing between the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mrs Davis,” Rio corrected, squeezing Agatha’s hand in gentle reprimand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha frowned heavily as a confused pout blossomed on her face, “
     <i>
      who?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio couldn’t stop the loud bark of laughter that escaped her throat, suddenly feeling lighter than she had in years at the combined sensation of Agatha’s warm hand in hers, her kiss fresh on her lips, and her wife’s terribly self-involved commentary ringing in her ears.

     <b>
      AGATHA
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen had been right; the first trial was indeed not the stuff of nightmares. On the surface at least.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, it turned out the be a beach house. A beach house set against an idyllic backdrop of golden sand, turquoise waves, and a peach-kissed sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had, as was her new coven’s primary response to any sort of stimuli, argued over how to open the door and whether it would be considered rude to just traipse right on through.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who didn’t give a damn about manners or rules, was the first to grasp the handle, swing the door open, and saunter across the threshold as though it were her own house.
    </p>
    <p>
     The interior was as classy and opulent as the exterior implied it would be, with cream couches, expensive artwork on the walls, an inbuilt bar, and even a whole wall crafted from glass to showcase the expansive horizon spreading out across the distance. A beautiful view no doubt, but one that birthed more questions than answers on just where they were, on how expansive The Road really was, and the level of magic required to run such a potent hex in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made her consider too, how unusual it was that The Road, so far at least, had presented them with a luxurious holiday destination, and not a cavern filled with spiders, or some just as horrific scene to battle through.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, what was even more surprising was the change The Road had made to their wardrobes the moment they had stepped inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced down, expecting to see her familiar clothing, only for it to be replaced with an entirely different look. One consisting of grey slacks, a white cashmere turtleneck, and a brown jacket that her locket had been pinned to; which was a relief to see, that was for damn sure.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Huh,” her lips curved in pleasant surprise whilst looking down to study her new outfit. Glancing around, she noticed all of the others had been redressed too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each of their prior outfits had been transformed into a particularly wealthy aesthetic, making them look like the type of people who could afford to own a house of this calibre. Rio looked particularly captivating in an emerald green velvet suit, one that had been tailored to her figure and didn’t appear to include a shirt, only a waistcoat. Agatha swallowed, feeling her gaze darken as she dragged heavy eyes across exposed collarbones and the small slither of tanned skin now visible between her waistcoat and waistband.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen was the first to step away from the front door, looking around with curious eyes, “it’s giving ‘
     <i>
      middle-aged second chance at love
     </i>
     ’ vibes, and I’m here for it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stayed back, even as the others followed after him. Her eyes shot to Rio briefly at the mention of finding love, finding his statement hitting a little too close to the truth for their current predicament. Shaking her head to rid herself of as childish a notion as love, she ran a nervous hand over the door, causing her anxiety regarding their change in scenery to increase exponentially the moment she noticed the door handle was gone and their exit was sealed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Definitely a '
     <i>
      sip-your-tea-with-both-hands
     </i>
     ' Kinda place,” Alice quipped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen stared at herself in the mirror, evidently shocked to have been restyled so differently to how she would choose to express herself. “I look like one of my customers,” her voice treading the line between disturbed and amused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, Teen’s voice cut across the rest, “check this out!” Agatha looked over from running a hand over a particularly ugly glass sculpture to find him holding a small card aloft. From this distance, it looked like an invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
     The group coalesced around him, Agatha managing to get there first to snatch the card from him, “what is this? A wedding? Please god, not a baby shower!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen then snatched it from her, which Agatha would have normally fought her over, but she found herself promptly distracted from trying to scrap with Jen by Rio’s warm presence, which settled beside her with a comforting hand on the small of her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      The Witches’ Road cordially invites you to The First Trial
     </i>
     ”. After a quick glance around at all of their faces, she flipped it over and exclaimed, “it’s a riddle!
     <i>
      My age has value, no fun alone, I mess with your mind, my tricks are well-known…
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t resist pointing out the most obvious answer, “sounds like a witch”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen was quick to quip back, “sounds like
     <i>
      you
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wasn’t above mimicking her like a child, which she did. Moments later she felt a smirk blooming across her face at Rio struggling to stifle a bout of laughter. A glowing warmth blossomed then, deep in her heart at the knowledge that at long, long last someone finally
     <i>
      got
     </i>
     her. She wasn’t being reprimanded for her humour, she wasn’t being scolded for being childish, or for being rude. No, Rio found her behaviour
     <i>
      amusing
     </i>
     , Rio found Agatha
     <i>
      funny
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     And as she felt her smirk softening into something gentler, something concerningly enamoured, Mrs Hart solved the riddle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Wine!
     </i>
     ” She exclaimed, reaching for a bottle of expensive red standing on the table behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s it! Ten points for Mrs Hart,” Alice said, sounding impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Arguing devolved from that point, as was their standard process. However it was clear, if not entirely obvious, that the wine would have to be consumed. Not by her though, hell no was she drinking that; it could be poisoned.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn’t take long for Teen to source a bottle opener, for them to open it, and pass round a glass of wine to each of them. Except for Teen that is, who had promptly asked for some and been denied by the far more boring and conservative members of this lacklustre coven. Though in her opinion, if a teenager could handle a situation as strange and anxiety-inducing as The Road, a place that shouldn’t even exist, the lad had earned himself a damn drink. Alas, she was outvoted; two to four. Rio of course, twin flame Agatha was discovering her to be, had voted for the teenager to have a drink too.
    </p>
    <p>
     The others spread out, sipping their cursed glasses of wine and chatting amongst themselves. It was an absurd sight really; this mismatched group of covenless witches, one teenage boy with a mysterious sigil, and their neighbour, all stuck together for this moment of magical chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio drifted towards the broad glass doors to enjoy the view, wine glass in hand. Utilising the opportunity of distraction, Agatha discreetly threw her drink on a large potted plant before turning back to study the green witch for a moment longer. Rio’s expression was contemplative, evidently thinking deeply on the trial at hand, or some other secret she was still refusing to share with Agatha. She found herself disturbed to see though, moments after Agatha had disposed of her own wine, Rio lifting her drink towards her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Hey!
     </i>
     ” She hissed, keeping her voice low enough to not be overheard. She scurried over and gripped Rio’s wrist, halting her upward motion. Quickly, she glanced over towards the others, who fortunately hadn’t looked over toward them, and dragged Rio out of view, pushing her into a small alcove housing a record player and a towering stack of records, “
     <i>
      don’t drink that!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who had allowed Agatha to drag her away, and who didn't look appropriately alarmed at Agatha’s alarm, simply looked down at the glass of wine in her hand, then back up towards Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?” Her tone was relaxed, almost amused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scowled, aware she couldn’t let slip the fact she hadn’t actually been here before. She had to warn her in a way that indicated she knew all the tricks of The Road, that she could be trusted to guide her safely.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just trust me, you do
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     want the hangover that wine will give you,” she tried to pull the glass from Rio, but she held fast refusing to loosen her grip.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That doesn’t seem very fair to the others now, does it Agatha?” She still didn't look concerned at all as she tutted dramatically. The mirth clear in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked, drawing closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was determined to get the wine away from Rio, unwilling as she was for her new… new
     <i>
      friend
     </i>
     to risk her life for this task when they had three spares along for the ride, three spares she didn't give a damn about whether they made it off The Road successfully or not. Yet, if she could make the process of capturing said drink from said friend
     <i>
      fun
     </i>
     … well, she was only human.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you being so
     <i>
      stubborn?
     </i>
     ” She whispered, running her hand up the wine glass to brush enticing fingers along the delicate bones of Rio’s wrist, enjoying the feel of her smooth skin beneath her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why aren’t you being a
     <i>
      team player
     </i>
     ,” Rio shot back, pupils expanding even as she continued to act indifferent to Agatha’s gentle caress.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pouted, “I didn’t realise you were such a rule follower. Don’t you want to break the rules with me?” She remained bold with her hands, running one up the flat of Rio’s stomach to tease at the bare skin visible at the top of her waistcoat, and the other under her tailored jacket to the small of her back, where she tucked possessive fingers into the waistband of her pants, holding her close.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bowing her head, she pressed a lingering kiss to Rio’s throat, “it’s fun to break the rules”. A wolfish grin bloomed on her face when she felt Rio shudder, a grin she made sure Rio could feel against her pulse, “it’s even been said once or twice that that's what they’re for; to be broken”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She drifted her mouth upwards, ensuring her touch remained light, barely a whisper, before claiming Rio’s mouth in a deep kiss, grateful that this was something they did now, that this was something Rio trusted her to do without trying to absorb her magic through her tongue. Which was as delicious and as fizzy as Rio had promised it would be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kissed her back immediately, deepening it the moment Agatha groaned and her back arched slightly, pressing her torso firmly against Rio's. It was so good, so damn good that Agatha completely forgot the main reason she had planned on kissing Rio in the first place; entirely forgetting to run a scheming hand down Rio’s arm to take the glass of wine away whilst she was distracted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead Agatha lost herself in the kiss, only to hiss with upset the moment they separated, and Rio brought the glass to her lips and downed the entire lot in a single smooth sip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Damn it!
     </i>
     ” She growled, pulling the empty glass from Rio’s hand; a pointless thing to do now it was empty. “I thought we were breaking rules together Vidal,” she glared up at her, their bodies still entwined tightly in a possessive embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk dropped into something endeared, a gentle, warm expression that made Agatha’s heart sputter in her chest. It reminded her of how it felt to miss a step whilst walking, when you expect the ground to be there to catch you, only to be met with empty air and the demands of gravity instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lowered her face to Agatha’s, pressing a long kiss to her mouth, a kiss Agatha could feel her smile through before drawing back, “a little fact about me sweetheart; I
     <i>
      always
     </i>
     follow the rules”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How boring,” Agatha snarked before rolling her eyes and snoring obnoxiously, as though Rio had started reading an unknowable tome on quantum physics to her. Yet, even through her dramatics, Agatha felt her stomach tighten with worry over what the wine might do to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     It suddenly struck her then, the reality of what she was experiencing, something she hadn't felt since a young boy had breathed his last.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Concern
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Concern for…
     <i>
      someone else?
     </i>
     Someone she had only known for a few days? The realisation heralded panic, which followed the worry pooling in her stomach, causing it to all mix together in an uncomfortable, unfamiliar mess.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, as though someone had just held a livewire to her ass, Agatha jolted backwards, removing her hands from Rio’s body. This feeling made her twitchy; the sensation of giving a shit about someone else. She didn’t like it, and as far as she could see, only one person was to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t say I didn’t warn you,” is all she managed to growl out through her swirling thoughts, before promptly turning to stride back towards the others, flicking her long, currently beautifully curled hair over her shoulders as she went.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her temper bristled further, when she heard Rio chuckle quietly behind her, as though Agatha's moment of claustrophobic panic had been anticipated. As though she
     <i>
      knew
     </i>
     Agatha, well enough as well, to predict her reactions and moods to a situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Needing a distraction from the frustrating witch taking up most of her thoughts, she swept closer to the other women, who were still gathered near the couch. Although she lurched back the moment her eyes landed on Mrs Hart’s exceptionally swollen face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Holy shit,” Rio said, stifling a laugh behind her hand, having followed closely behind Agatha to regroup with their mismatched coven.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice approached Mrs Hart cautiously, “Sharon... you’re a little swollen”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs Hart suddenly looked terrified, “is it bad?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted with amusement and laid herself along the back of the sofa, feeling a sense of relief easing into her nervous system at not having consumed the wine herself, “I think she looks fantastic”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ve been poisoned,” Jen’s voice rang out across the room, tone severe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Panic ensued as everyone scampered to study themselves in any reflective surface they could find, each of them reacting in their own unique way to this particularly hilarious symptom of the toxic wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my god! I have
     <i>
      jowls!
     </i>
     " Alice panicked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My
     <i>
      face!
     </i>
     My
     <i>
      formerly perfect face!
     </i>
     ” Jen cried.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Honestly,” Lilia drawled, studying herself in a hand-held mirror, “I don’t hate it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Amongst the chaos, Agatha crept toward the other doors, testing each one to see if any of them opened, hunting for an exit. However, the moment she spun around, frustrated to the tips of her teeth that not a single door or window would budge, she noticed Rio sat on the sofa, leaning back with her arms and knees spread out, looking devilishly handsome in that damn suit, devilishly handsome and not at all swollen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The poison wasn’t affecting her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn’t upsetting her system
     <i>
      at all
     </i>
     . And it would appear as though Rio knew this to be the case too, for there wasn’t a single hint of concern or panic on her distractingly lovely face. No, instead of worrying like the others, she was just sat there, watching, reacting to their reactions, as though they were merely an immersive troupe of actors performing a captivating play.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes narrowed as she stalked toward her, not stopping until she was stood right in front of Rio, so close that Agatha’s legs had halted between the green witches, as she stared down at her with a suspicious glare.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why aren’t you all puffy too?” She demanded, hands gesturing toward Rio's face impatiently before dropping to land on her own hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged nonchalantly, though that familiar glimmer of amusement was still sparkling in her eyes, “I have a strong constitution”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bowed closer, lowering her face toward Rio's to search for a single inch of swollen skin, which there was none, “...and so slides another puzzle piece into my pocket".
    </p>
    <p>
     "Puzzle piece?" Rio asked, voice dramatically affected to sound
     <i>
      oh-so
     </i>
     innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyes remained narrowed, "yes, puzzle piece. I'm collecting them all Vidal, every single one. Every time you say something unusual, every time you do something strange, every time you react absurdly; I'm collecting them all, every piece of information on you I can. And soon, soon I will figure it out and all of your secrets will be mine to keep".
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk transformed into a puckish grin, “keep collecting them sweetheart, you’ll still never guess right”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her stomach pulse with want at both Rio’s challenging words and the woman herself, sat beneath her in a position that should be deferential, yet still managing to comport herself in a manner befitting royalty.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll see,” Agatha bit out, matching Rio’s grin with a feral one of her own. Their eyes remained locked for a short moment, the tension and secrets bristling between them like the hackles of an angry dog, before Agatha's attention was dragged away by the conversation taking place behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you feel tingling in the back of your throat?” Jen was questioning Mrs Hart, trying to figure out what the poison could be.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No!” Mrs Hart answered, eyes wide with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen nodded once before asking another, “do you taste mulberries?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do mulberries taste like?” Mrs Hart whimpered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sensing this was going to take a hot minute, Agatha sighed and dropped to perch on Rio’s knee who held her steady with a hand on her hip. She glanced around to meet Rio’s eye, throwing up an exasperated, impatient hand at the scene in front of them, which prompted an understanding smirk to bloom on Rio’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I feel a little better,” Mrs Hart said suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice looked relieved, “your face is back to normal”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Phew!
     </i>
     ” Agatha said dramatically, miming wiping away a sweat-drenched brow with the back of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs Hart ran curious fingers over her own face, “yay!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen however looked terrified, “not
     <i>
      yay
     </i>
     . Very much not
     <i>
      yay!
     </i>
     ” Jen glanced from face to face, taking in each of their fearful expressions before explaining, “the fact that the face swelling decreased so quickly means it could only be one type of poison: Alewife’s Revenge. Face swelling is just the beginning. Next is dizziness, delirium, loss of motor-function, heart racing, hallucinations, and eventually…
     <i>
      Death
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s leg muscles tensed beneath her, prompting Agatha to turn and stare at her.
     <i>
      Finally, she reacts
     </i>
     . Finally, a spark of fear from her calm companion. Although Agatha’s satisfaction was marred the moment she felt another disturbingly uncharacteristic spike of concern for Rio's wellbeing. So much so, Agatha couldn’t resist running her hand down the back of Rio’s head, smoothing her hair in an attempt at offering comfort; even though she was terrible at it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced up and caught her eye, although this time her smirk remained absent.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do you spell Alewife?” Teen asked, his timing as terrible as his current combover.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes scanned across Rio’s face and body, feeling an inexplicable need to make sure she was still herself and not yet a victim to the poison or it's symptoms. Once satisfied Rio’s face was lovely as it always was, she grabbed her wrist and hauled them both of the sofa, “
     <i>
      come on
     </i>
     ,” she said quietly, “
     <i>
      let’s get out of here
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     They didn’t get far though before Jen pointed an accusatory finger at the pair of them, “they didn’t drink the poison. You can’t cheat your way out of this! You have to drink it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Why?
     </i>
     ” Agatha sniped back, feeling cornered, “
     <i>
      who says?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      The Road!
     </i>
     ” Lilia drawled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, that’s ridiculous! We don’t
     <i>
      all
     </i>
     have to suffer. Teen didn’t drink!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He’s not in the coven, and he’s underage!” Jen argued.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio interrupted their argument with a simple, “I drank it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha elbowed her and hissed out the side of her mouth, “shut up!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen suddenly looked unsure, glancing at Alice for a brief moment for, before focusing back on Rio, “you did?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I did, tasted good. Like old grapes gone mouldy,” Rio grinned, that same unnerving smile she always seemed to adopt when talking to the potions witch, much to Agatha’s consistent amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen glanced around, “can anyone verify Rio drank the wine?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen held up a hand, “the glass over there is empty – the lipstick on it matches Rio’s current shade”. He then pointed to another glass, the one Agatha had abandoned on the counter after watering the plant with her portion, now once again full to the brim with dark wine, “that one is Agatha’s. I saw her hovering by the plant after we first poured the wine”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pouted and crossed her arms, raising her chin arrogantly, “you know, snitches get murdered in prison”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen didn’t look scared, he looked unimpressed with both her and her joke as he fetched the now full glass of wine and tried to pass it to her, “well, it’s a good thing we're not in jail then, isn’t it? Now, drink it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      No
     </i>
     ,” Agatha said, voice petulant as she pushed his hand and the glass away from herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia approached, her expression a brewing storm, “I’m going to shove it down your gullet, so help me!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Having had enough of this whole ‘
     <i>
      team-versus-Agatha
     </i>
     ’ energy she was picking up on, a horribly familiar throwback to her original coven, she hissed out an angry, “you know what!” before grabbing the glass and chucking it at the wooden floor, shattering it into pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      No!
     </i>
     ” Several of the coven cried as Agatha glanced around at each of them, feeling particularly smug at besting them all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah!,” she jeered, “mmhmm!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “On the upholstery?!” Mrs Hart groaned, devastated at the sight of red wine staining the expensive fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We are wasting time!” Lilia snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have to
     <i>
      drink
     </i>
     , Agatha!” Alice implored, trying a gentler approach than the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     She threw up a flippant shrug, “well I would, but there’s no more wine”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quickly, as though she could hear the clock ticking directly in her ear, Alice glanced around before snatching Rio’s glass up, which immediately started to refill with wine. Alice looked up to glare at Agatha in smug victory.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So
     <i>
      cute
     </i>
     ,” Agatha jibed, starting to feel uncomfortably warm beneath her clothes from the stress of this situation, at experiencing, once again, the disdain of an entire coven for doing what any animal would and should do when in a dangerous situation; try to protect itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen’s glare was the harshest of them all, “
     <i>
      drink!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     His tone took her by surprise, forcing her to do a double take. However, the moment he took an angry step forward, obviously intent on pressuring her into drinking the full glass of wine, he was halted where he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Rio had swept in between them, hand on the handle of her knife, eyes dark, almost oppressive with the strength of her outrage.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Back. Off
     </i>
     ,” she growled, voice low, almost bassy as she pulled her knife from it’s sheath and held it out towards Teen’s chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could see the tension in Rio’s shoulders, could tell she was entirely prepared to strike Teen if he took a single step closer. So, in a bid to calm her down she placed a warm palm between Rio's shoulder blades, attempting to soothe her animosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen reared back further the moment the blade was drawn, evidently not expecting Rio to be quite as protective as she was being. He glanced around nervously before pulling the wine glass from Alice’s hand, “fine, then I will!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Now Agatha was many things, most of them not particularly self-sacrificing or moral, but she did have at least one line she refused to cross. She didn’t hurt children, and this child, as much as she knew he would hate to be referred to as such, was about to drink poison in her stead.
    </p>
    <p>
     So without prior thought, she snapped out a “no!” and grabbed the glass from Alice before he could.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio span, eyes wide with concern as Agatha hesitated momentarily to stare at the dark liquid, already gagging at the prospect of such terrible wine, before finally biting the bullet and downing the entire glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Ugh
     </i>
     ,” she retched, “
     <i>
      ugh!
     </i>
     ”
     <i>
      It’s so cheap!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please,
     <i>
      please!
     </i>
     Wanda? Wanda, I’m
     <i>
      begging
     </i>
     you. Let him
     <i>
      breathe
     </i>
     , please!” Mrs Hart was pleading with a non-existent Wanda for her dead husband's mercy, her eyes glazed, staring off into the distance before promptly collapsing onto the couch, unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So,” Teen quipped, “the hallucinations seem chill”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was distracted from all that was happening however, because the moment the poison touched her tongue, she felt it’s toxicity take affect causing her skin to tighten, to become hot and painful to the touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,
     <i>
      Potions Witch
     </i>
     ,” she called out to Jen, demanding her attention, “it’s time to brew an antidote,” her face now the same swollen vision as all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     They had split into groups to gather the list of ingredients Jen required to brew an antidote.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia, Teen, and Alice had gone to one end of the house looking for frankincense and honey, whilst she and Rio had been sent out to hunt for zooplankton, which she had a sneaking suspicion Jen’s product's would be stuffed to the brim with.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately her face had deflated around ten minutes ago, although the dizziness that kept trying to sweep her feet out from under her was becoming rather bothersome.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was after the third time she had swayed into the wall in the hallway, arms full of products so unable to stop herself from landing on her face, that Rio interjected, guiding her with a gentle hand into one of the bedrooms to perch on the bed for a brief moments respite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could feel sweat gathering on her brow, so took a moment to breath through the toxin making its way through her body and closed her eyes, inhaling deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
     She heard Rio shift slightly before a cool palm slid over her forehead. Its temperature felt like heaven, and she soon found herself leaning into it, eager for more of Rio’s soothing skin to touch her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes opened to find Rio crouched in front of her with a deeply concerned twist to her brow, their faces level.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just take a moment,” Rio ordered, flipping her hand around to feel Agatha’s temperature with the back of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We have to get this crap back to Jen,” she insisted, finding even the action of talking taking far more energy than it should.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We will,” Rio said, voice certain that their mission would be completed without failure, “but first, just take a minute. You don’t look too hot right now”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even through the poison’s toxicity she managed to scoff, “
     <i>
      excuse you
     </i>
     , I always look hot”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s responding smile held a warmth that a near-strangers shouldn't. “Well,” she drawled, running the hand that had been checking Agatha’s temperature down to tuck a loose lock of hair behind her ear; a motion of comfort and familiarity, one that caused Agatha’s heart to clench with something similar to yearning, “I can’t argue with you on that”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled, unable to stop herself from doing so as her eyes locked on Rio’s. A moment of silence settled between them, the gentle kind, like that singular moment of stillness before falling into a long, peaceful sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt that same panic from before start to brew in her stomach and try to claw its way up her throat the longer they stayed in this strange purgatory. Because she felt, quite suddenly, as exposed as if she had been sat there entirely nude. It was unnerving, for it felt as though Rio could see right through her, that there wasn’t a single thought or feeling she could conceal from this woman, this woman who had secrets upon secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt desperately unfair, like the scales between them were weighted in Rio’s favour. And it was especially precarious when she considered just how quickly her heart was beating beneath her ribs, how furiously her pulse was fluttering beneath her skin, and how her soul felt as though it had finally, at long, long last, found a place to call home.
    </p>
    <p>
     The words slipped out without conscious thought, her voice now quiet, almost pleading for the truth, in complete contrast to the anger that had exploded out of her the last time she had asked Rio this particular question.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Who are you?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face remained clear, her lovely eyes flickering across Agatha’s face as though trying to memorise her features. It was clear she was contemplating what to say, of how much of herself to reveal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her jaw dropped once as if to speak, before her brows dropped heavily over her eyes in a frustrated frown as her lips met once more, keeping their silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sensing she was close to breaking, Agatha asked again, “please tell me who you are?
     <i>
      please
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sighing heavily, Rio dragged a hand down her face, “I- I can’t tell you anymore than I have”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A spark of anger lit in Agatha’s stomach, “why the fuck not?” She closed her eyes, swaying a moment as the toxin made a wave of heat wash through her, not helped by the rush of her own temper. They didn’t have time for this, the didn’t have time for this damn conversation right now, yet Agatha had never felt so close to learning the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s responding expression was one of worry, of deep concern. In fact, there wasn't a single note of the anger Agatha had been expecting to be find on Rio's face as she said, “I have no idea what will happen if I do,” her features hardened slightly, “I won’t risk you Agatha. I refuse to do it for my own gratification or for yours”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Confusion joined the mess of emotions seeping into Agatha's stomach, “
     <i>
      risk
     </i>
     me? How would you be
     <i>
      risking
     </i>
     me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head and stood up, “come on, we need to get back. We don’t have time to discuss this right now”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glared up at her, ever stubborn, even with sweat pooling on her forehead and nausea swirling in her stomach, she refused to move until she finally received some answers.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t get a chance to say anything else though, for Rio waved a hand and transported them in a cloud of emerald green smoke from one end of the house to the other. The rest of their coven were assembled already, having found their ingredients and brought them back to Jen, who had set the sink up to act as a cauldron.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where’s the zooplankton?” She demanded the moment they reappeared, her face looking just as ragged from the poison's contamination as Agatha felt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here,” she held up Jen’s own products, raising a challenging eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen hesitated, obviously caught.
    </p>
    <p>
     “All natural or not, Jen?” Agatha teased.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Drop it in,” she ordered, voice tight with a reluctant confession.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      I knew it!
     </i>
     ” Agatha said, throwing the products, containers and all, straight into the potion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen stirred the antidote as instructed, each of them waiting with eager expressions for it to change colour and indicate that it was ready, yet nothing changed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen looked sheepish as she glanced around at all of their pallid faces, “any bright ideas on how to set this sink to boil?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      You didn’t think of this before?!
     </i>
     ” Agatha roared, furious at the potion witch's ineptitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     “In the middle of a traumatic hallucination?” Jen thundered back, “no Agatha,
     <i>
      I did not!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here,” Rio said, stepping forward to lay a palm against the side of the sink. Moments later it was bubbling away as though a fire had been lit beneath it. Agatha gaped, staring at Rio in awe. For that level of magic would usually take an incantation, or at least be physically manifesting itself on the conjurer's expression or body, making them strain and gasp. Yet, Rio’s face was smooth, her brow calm and cool, even though she too had consumed the poisoned wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen, Lilia, and Alice were all looking on with similar expressions of impressed shock. Jen was the first to snap back into action, “everyone pull a strand of hair out of your head now. A single hair only. Everybody, hurry up!”
    </p>
    <p>
     However, just as Agatha was raising a hand to pluck said hair from her head, she froze. For a noise had echoed across the kitchen, loud enough to drown out all other sounds; the bubbling potion, the panicked voices of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a baby’s cry, a familiar cry too, one she never thought she would hear again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning slowly, her eyes found a simple pram, set between the kitchen island and the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
     As though in a trance, she started walking towards it. Her eyes were already pooling with tears at the prospect of seeing her son again, of seeing Nicky as he had been all those years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet the moment she reached forward and pulled back the soft blanket, the baby’s cry came to a sudden muted stop and in the place of a baby was the Darkhold; the item every witch here, except perhaps Rio, believed Agatha had traded her child for. Her darling boy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rearing back in horror at seeing the Darkhold again, especially in the stead of her baby, she gasped in desperate gulping breaths, for her lungs felt like they were on the verge of collapsing under the weight of her suddenly unmanageable grief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agatha!
     </i>
     ” Jen’s voice broke through her hysteria, grounding her in reality to see that the pram was gone, that it had never even been there in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     Scrabbling to turn on her knees, feeling not much more than a wild animal at this point, she found herself gasping all over again the moment she did so, for Rio had left her station and dropped to the ground beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you alright?” She asked, voice tight with worry.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Oh god
     </i>
     ,” She groaned, finding the similarity between this enigmatic woman with pockets bursting with secrets and the son she had lost even more potent whilst his cry was still ringing in her ears. Her hands shot out, and without conscious thought she gripped Rio’s shoulders, tightly curling her fingers into the material of her suit jacket, unable to let her go when she looked so like him, when Agatha had been so close to finding him again, to
     <i>
      seeing
     </i>
     him in that pram, only for it to have been a cruel trick of The Road’s torturous trial.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned heavily. She was obviously confused, which made sense considering she wouldn't have witnessed Agatha's hallucination or be aware of it’s context even if she had. Yet, her ability to provide whatever Agatha needed, even without her verbalising whatever that might be, was clear in the way she wrapped her arms around Agatha’s waist and lifted her from the ground, keeping her close in the halo of her arms once they were standing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could feel herself trembling, as humiliating as it was, but couldn’t seem to stop herself as she stared into Rio’s eyes. Those eyes that were the exact same shade of ochre as Nicky’s; even down to the individual flecks of mahogany, and the streaks of bronze that glowed golden when the sun hit them just right.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on,” Rio urged gently, guiding Agatha back towards the sink, aware the clock was ticking on all of their lives, as the poisoned wine continued to spread throughout their bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, we need your hair!” Jen said, her words an order not a request.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Agatha had comprehended the demand through the haze of her recent turmoil, Rio had already lifted a hand and plucked a single hair from Agatha’s head, dropping it into the mix with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And yours too, Rio,” Jen prompted impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze met Jen’s, “I dropped mine in already, before I went to help Agatha”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s eyebrows rose in clear disbelief. She gestured at the potion, “this won’t work if you don’t put your hair in too”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The responding flash of
     <i>
      something
     </i>
     in Rio’s gaze was potent. It wasn’t exactly anger, nor was it upset. It was a strange third thing. Like power incarnate, or a glimpse of
     <i>
      something
     </i>
     that none of them should have born witness to. It made Agatha’s pulse thrum hotly beneath her skin, a desperate mix of curiosity and hunger for that power Rio wielded so easily, and for the authority that Rio insisted on hiding behind a teasing smirk or slightly eccentric behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright,” Jen finally said, giving in with a despondent shrug, “but it will be all of our funerals when this doesn’t work”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It will work,” Rio said, voice brooking no room for argument, “you just need to add the final ingredient”.
    </p>
    <p>
     An expression of shock fell across Jen’s face, “oh shit, of course! I completely forgot”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well...
     <i>
      what is it?!
     </i>
     ” Lilia demanded, slapping both hands down on the counter, shooting a furtive glance toward the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We need the blood of the unpoisoned”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t hesitate to pull the knife from Rio’s belt and grab Teen by the elbow, “thanks for being underage”.
    </p>
    <p>
     To his credit, he didn’t fight her, instead he let her pull his hand over the sink and wait for Jen’s signal to run the blade across his palm, which sliced open as easily as hot butter on a summers day, before clenching a fist to squeeze fat pearls of scarlet into the potion, which immediately flashed a bright cerulean.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slid the blade back into Rio’s belt before they grabbing one of the cups of antidote being offered around. Each of them gulped it down quickly whilst gagging at the horrible flavour. Almost instantly, Agatha felt the cool relief of the medicine working, as it chased the toxin through her blood stream, swallowing it entirely and saving her from suffering any further side effects.
    </p>
    <p>
     She passed a cup over for the others to force feed to Mrs Hart, who for this entire trial had been unconscious on the couch. Perhaps it had something to do with her mortal blood? Unused to handling the potent energy witch-folk dealt with so naturally?
    </p>
    <p>
     Moments later, the timer started to beep and the oven door clanged open.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that our exit?” Alice asked, voice lilting with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia bent down to study it, “I am
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     climbing in an oven!” She turned and stared at them all, a dramatic flourish in her words and expression, “that happened to a friend of mine. She had a lovely house, and she ended up-”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Screams erupted at the same level of ferocity as the water suddenly bursting through the windows surrounding the kitchen. Agatha was caught beneath a waterfall, yelling furiously for a long moment before her survival instincts kicked in and she started to wade her way towards the oven doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Help me with her!” Alice screamed, trying to lift Mrs Hart from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not a chance!” Agatha yelled back, glancing around for Rio who she could see standing beside Alice. Unlike the rest of them who were all panicking at the prospect of drowning, Rio’s entire person exhumed calm, and there was a certain weight to her expression as she stared down at their unconscious neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen hurried over in Agatha’s stead, yelling as he did so, “we don’t know what happens if we leave her behind!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Fine!
     </i>
     ” Agatha finally agreed, stomping over to grab a limb and help haul the unconscious woman over to the exit, “god! She’s so little, why is she so
     <i>
      heavy?!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen and Lilia were visible on the other side of the oven the moment they crouched down with Mrs Hart held between them all. “Just shove her in there,” Agatha commanded, “just shove her, shove her in there!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Once their heavy parcel was delivered, she glanced up at Teen, “you next!”
    </p>
    <p>
     He did as he was told, sliding into the small door with the ease of youth before she then looked at Rio, “now you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned at her, looking particularly feral with her wet hair plastered around her face and the waterfall roaring in the background through countless broken windows, “beauty before wisdom,” Rio said, giving Agatha’s shoulder a gentle push.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not a particularly self-sacrificing person, Agatha didn’t hesitate to accept Rio’s generous insistence, “all right. Me next!”
    </p>
    <p>
     She then slid herself through the door on her back, crying a victorious wail as she did so, which quickly turned into a genuine scream when the door turned into a slide that twisted and turned between scraggly trees and heavy mists. Her lovely coat was back too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice came next, which made sense considering just how chivalrous Rio had proven herself to be, as much as it frustrated her that Rio would prioritise a random witch over herself. Finally, Rio appeared, spinning down the slide, cackling madly; truly a woman of vast layers and unspoken depths.
    </p>
    <p>
     She landed with an ‘
     <i>
      umph
     </i>
     ’ beside Agatha, who had already gotten to her feet, soaking wet and kicking Jen out of her way the moment the potions witch tried to stand up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A little
     <i>
      rusty
     </i>
     there, Jen?” She couldn’t resist jibing, now her life wasn’t in imminent danger.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A little
     <i>
      traitorous
     </i>
     there, Agatha?” Jen immediately shot back, shooting her a heavy scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop,” Lilia intervened like a mother between squabbling siblings, “we’re alive. We made it through the first test, everyone is safe”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not everyone,” Teen announced, voice shaking, “Sharon’s dead”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who’s
     <i>
      Sharon?
     </i>
     ” Agatha asked, genuinely confused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia, Alice, and Jen all looked fatigued at her behaviour, Teen however, looked scandalised.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” She asked, frowning at him.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      She’s
     </i>
     Sharon,” Teen hissed pointing at the woman at their feet, his youth and innocence on broad display at feeling this level of despair from something as mundane as death.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Oh!
     </i>
     ” She crowed, pointing, “you mean Mrs Hart”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other three witches ignored her, each of them kneeling beside the body to pay their respects, as Teen gently pulled her eyelids down so it would appear as though she was sleeping. Rio however, remained where she stood, still dripping wet in her black jeans and t-shirt, eyes fixed on the corpse as though it had wronged her in some way.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You good?” Agatha asked, skirting Mrs Hart and her mourners to draw closer to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s neck snapped round to stare at her the moment she heard her voice. A flash of panic suddenly crossed her face, before her eyes started to flicker between Agatha and Mrs Hart, as though trying to figure out the answer to an equation that included the two of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” Agatha soothed, assuming she was distressed at the other woman's death too. “It’s alright, she lived a… you know… she lived
     <i>
      a
     </i>
     life,” running a hand down Rio’s arm to comfort her, even through a frown of confusion. For everything she learned about this woman made her make less sense in Agatha's mind. She didn’t panic after drinking poison, she didn’t consume nor need the antidote, she wasn’t worried when the kitchen was literally flooding.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this,
     <i>
      a body
     </i>
     , was enough to stop her, was enough to freeze her energetic momentum in place as though an arctic breeze had suddenly swept through the clearing they were gathered in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t say anything, she just continued to stare at the body, even as Teen and Alice grabbed sturdy branches to use as makeshift shovels and started to dig a shallow grave.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Guys!” Agatha crooned, finding the thought of hanging around frustrating beyond reason, “I don’t think that’s necessary, Mrs Hart wouldn’t mind if we-”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was promptly cut off by four voices yelling at her simultaneously, “
     <i>
      Sharon!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, alright,
     <i>
      damn!
     </i>
     ” She gestured placatingly with both hands, willing them all to calm down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, as though someone had flicked a switch within her mind, Rio shot forward to grip Agatha’s hand and tug her away from the others. “Listen to me,” she implored, voice serious and face set.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but smirk at Rio grasping her so tightly, “I’m listening hot stuff, although if you’re trying to snatch me away for a quickie you don’t need to ask, I’m in”. She then tried to lead Rio deeper into the trees, but was stopped short when Rio didn’t move.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning, her eyebrow rose in question as she tugged on her hand once more, implying Rio should follow her. But again, Rio remained still, her face heavily pained.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can’t Agatha, I can’t right now,” her voice was a pleading whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha frowned, “why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s jaw dropped uncertainly as her eyes flickered towards Lilia who was still bowed over Mrs Hart, chanting a haunting song of farewell, “I- I can’t because I have to go-”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately Agatha felt her throat tighten and her muscles tense beneath her skin at the prospect, “what?
     <i>
      Why?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tugged her closer, running her other hand down Agatha’s arm so she was gripping both her hands tightly, “I can’t explain right now, but I have to leave for a short while”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s frown, if at all possible, became heavier, “you cant just
     <i>
      leave
     </i>
     The Road, Rio.
     <i>
      It’s The Road
     </i>
     ”. She emphasised the realm’s name as though she found Rio simple, which to be fair, considering what the green witch was suggesting, wasn’t entirely removed from the list of possibilities. “You know,
     <i>
      The Witches Road
     </i>
     . Incredible magic, kind of a '
     <i>
      stuck-here-until-you-solve-it
     </i>
     ' sort of situation”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need you to trust me. I know none of this will be making a lot of sense, but I
     <i>
      need
     </i>
     to leave for a while; a few hours max and then I’ll be back. I promise,” Rio implored.
    </p>
    <p>
     A whisper of a memory was tempted from the back of her mind at Rio’s words, it was a memory dressed in scarlet, one from her time trapped as Agnes. Several clear moments of Rio leaving intermittently followed. Agnes would always ask her to stay, Rio would then always insist she must go but would return without failure; much like she was doing now.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was of equal measures comforting and disturbing. Comforting because Rio had indeed always returned, but disturbing because Agatha still didn’t know
     <i>
      why?
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt herself reacting, as she so often did to situations that caused her to feel unsure or vulnerable, with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So
     <i>
      what?
     </i>
     ” She snatched her hands back, putting them on her own hips instead as she glared at Rio, “you just
     <i>
      leave
     </i>
     , go flouncing off to wherever without answering a single question, and leave me here to carry on without you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha saw a spark of frustration ignite in Rio’s eyes, “it’s not that simple”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sneered in response to Rio’s weak excuses, “it is actually, it
     <i>
      is
     </i>
     that simple. What the hell could be more important than this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio remained silent, her eyes dark with irritation. Whether it was at herself or at Agatha, she wasn’t entirely sure.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha had grown tired of her excuses, of the constant secrecy. Of questions without answers, of similarities and power and memories that didn’t belong to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had grown tired of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Scoffing harshly, she crossed her arms and dragged her eyes up from Rio’s boots to her eyes, which were still heavy with the weight of words she refused to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whatever,” Agatha scoffed, shrugging as though she didn’t give a shit. Which she didn’t, or at least that’s what she was insisting on telling herself, “you go do…
     <i>
      whatever
     </i>
     it is you feel the need to do. But don’t expect me to be sat here waiting for you like Agnes did”.
    </p>
    <p>
     With that she turned on her heel and stalked off between the trees, leaving Rio behind to fend for herself, just like Rio was planning to do to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And If the action made her feel sick, and if the thought of Rio leaving her behind, even after only knowing her for a few short days, made her want to bawl like a child, well that was her own damn business.

     <b>
      AGATHA
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wasn’t surprised by how little time it took for the others to notice Rio’s absence, she just would have preferred anyone other than Jen, the witch she had the least patience for, to ask the pivotal question, “Where the hell is Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed and closed her eyes, trying to claw together what little patience she had left. “Rio has…” she paused, grasping for an excuse although she too was in the dark, “she has had to step off The Road for a few hours, alright,” she kept her voice light, eyebrows raised and smile tight, daring anyone to question her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Which they immediately did. Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Stepped off
     </i>
     The Road?” Jen repeated disbelievingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      A few hours?
     </i>
     ” Alice questioned, still waist deep in Mrs Hart’s grave, “what do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can’t just
     <i>
      step off
     </i>
     The Road,” Teen argued, as though Agatha had designed the game rules herself and had been caught breaking them. He pulled his spellbook from his back pocket to rifle through it, hunting for any forgotten notes that mention a
     <i>
      get-off-The-Road
     </i>
     clause that he might have missed in his initial research.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia remained silent, her eyes wise and heavy on Agatha’s face as all the other voices continued to rise in volume, echoing throughout their small patch of forest. She allowed them to carry on for a few moments before the pitch of them all squawking at her became too grating, and she felt compelled to throw out both hands and silence them with a loud, obnoxious shushing noise.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio’s
     <i>
      gone
     </i>
     alright. For how long specifically? I don’t know,” she stared at each of them in turn, demanding they remain quiet with the potency of her glare, “she told me she would be back, and all we can do right now is hope that she is telling us the truth”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Noticing Jen was gearing up to demand yet even more answers, Agatha silenced her with a loud clap of her hands, “right then, now that’s all cleared up. Shall we? Alright,” She spun, throwing her coat out behind her to act as a full stop to this particular interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no one followed her. Instead, each of them stayed still and continued to stare at her as though disbelieving the depth of her indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
     She grappled to hold onto her small, remaining thread of patience and turned to soothe whatever issue was
     <i>
      now
     </i>
     causing them to move so damn slowly, feeling very much like a frustrated teacher might whilst herding a whole class of kindergarteners around.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, so what’s the problem now?” She asked, glancing around impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A woman is dead Agatha,” Lilia scolded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” she nodded slowly, “and Alice and Teen are kindly digging a grave for her. So, they’ll catch up when they can. Vámonos!” She tried to lead them away a second time, but again found their stubbornness to be a stronger foe than she had anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay,” she finally relented, “Mrs Hart shouldn’t have been here, but it’s no one’s fault except her own that she insisted on talking about
     <i>
      garbage removal
     </i>
     in the middle of a summoning spell, alright”. She threw up a conciliatory hand, “of course The Road killed her, more power for the rest of us!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had hoped that final claim would have pleased them; it pleased her after all. But apparently their desire to appear righteous outweighed the truth, which was that every single one of them was on The Road for the exact same reason Agatha, she was just the only one being honest about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Setting aside your staggering callousness, we still have the issue of our incomplete coven,” Jen drawled, standing from the log she had been perched upon.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, okay. Yes, okay, now I know the confusion,” she swirled one hand over the other, “we needed the whole gang to access The Road. But after that, it’s anybody’s game. It’s like the Ballad says,
     <i>
      Burn and brew, with coven two, and glory shall be thine
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     She was lying through her teeth, making it all up as she went. An impressive feat if she did say so herself considering only a few days earlier she had been shored up within her own mind, still Wanda’s prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, a pain sparked deep in her skull at thoughts of Wanda. Suddenly, memories blurred, and the residual presence of scarlet magic in her mind seemed to glow in ominous warning. She shook her head, eager to dispel the distraction, and the thought of any ounce of Wanda’s magic still being present within her body. She felt disturbed by the idea of it still having an effect on her even now, like Wanda was some sort of twisted puppeteer and Agatha merely a doll with strings to pull on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s irritating voice dislodged her thoughts from their current predicament, dragging her back to reality, “the Ballad clearly says,
     <i>
      with coven true, glory shall be thine
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, “no it doesn’t! It’s coven
     <i>
      two
     </i>
     ,” she insisted, holding up two fingers to illustrate her point.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      That doesn’t make any sense
     </i>
     ,” Jen argued childishly, elongating the vowels and dragging out her words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her immature behaviour sparked a twin flame in Agatha, for she promptly spat back, “it does if you’re a student of the Ballad!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia’s familiar drawl interrupted their argument, “her mother recorded the most popular version of the Ballad, so maybe we ask Alice”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Okay!
     </i>
     ” Agatha threw up a hand, spinning round to face Alice and implore her to agree with Agatha's point. She had written the damn song after all, she knew the words. And Lorna Wu damn well knew them too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice didn’t affirm either of them though, instead she asked Agatha another question she found herself lying to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How many witches left The Road with you last time?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Thinking quickly, Agatha solemnly held up one finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen looked unsure for a brief moment before her expression hardened into something stubborn, “well, whatever. We still need a Green Witch”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well,
     <i>
      our
     </i>
     Green Witch has stepped out for a minute,” Agatha snapped, unwilling to consider any alternative options, or the thought of Rio not keeping her promise and leaving Agatha here on The Road alone, “so, we’ll just have to make do without one until Rio comes back”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      If
     </i>
     Rio comes back,” Jen murmured, tone baiting.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      When
     </i>
     ,” Agatha intoned, her voice edged dangerously, “
     <i>
      when
     </i>
     she comes back”. Having had quite enough of the entire interaction, she threw a lazy hand towards Alice and Teen, “get digging then. You have fifteen minutes to get her in the ground, or else I’m leaving without you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And with that, she threw her coattails behind her and spun to saunter off between the trees, suddenly desiring nothing more than a moment to herself. Or at least, a moment with the only witch who was no longer beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice’s trial was next, that much was obvious almost immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     The five of them had crossed the threshold to discover a house stolen directly from the 1970s. The entire room was constructed from either warm stone or dark mahogany. The floor was polished, records and portraits of different musicians decorated the walls, and musical instruments were spread out sporadically, as though a band had just stepped out the back door from a recording session for a quick cigarette break.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, she caught a glimpse of her own reflection, jaw dropping open with just how good she looked, “oh, check me out!” Her outfit was everything she would have chosen for herself, in fact it was everything she had chosen for herself during that particular decade, including skin-tight golden flares and a navy sleeveless jacket, one with floating pieces of fabric for sleeves, and an intricate design upon it’s lapels.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other’s drifted over to stare into the mirror too, their eyebrows raising almost instantly in appreciation for their own new looks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean seriously, we’re an album cover waiting to happen,” Teen quipped. Agatha couldn’t disagree with his statement; even she had to admit everyone looked
     <i>
      good
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “The Road changes for the coven,” Lilia reminded them all, parroting Agatha’s earlier words, which had been entirely made up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The Road isn’t subtle,” Alice sighed, staring morosely at herself. Agatha couldn’t help but wonder if she could see her mother reflecting back at her in that moment, their similarities even more obvious now, not just by being one another’s closest kin, but by seeing herself surrounded by her mother’s world of music and 70s décor.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh!” Teen threw his hand up like an eager student, “I was just thinking about the invite on the mantel. Maybe there is like, a riddle, or a kick-off for this one, too”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright,” Agatha gestured for everyone to spread out, “you heard the teenager. Look around and see if there is a clue or a hint hidden amongst the gaudiness”.
    </p>
    <p>
     For once, they did as ordered without asking any questions or arguing back, and for a few still moments the only sounds resounding throughout the large room were gentle footsteps and the brush of fingertips over shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, as promptly as the silence had settled it was disturbed by a loud creaking sound.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is that?” Alice asked, voice sharp and alert.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone started to spin on the spot, glancing around to source the origin of the noise, whilst subconsciously grouping together in the centre of the room; almost like a real coven might have.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s getting louder,” Lilia said, clinging to Jen’s arm tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned in a circle, determined to locate the threat when she noticed movement coming from the corner of the room. It was a large potted plant, as round as a tyre, with a curving palm tree shooting from the earth it held, the same earth that was spitting out in small clumps, right onto the floor in sporadic bursts.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the
     <i>
      fuck?
     </i>
     ” Agatha drawled, breath baited and held as she watched the entire plant pot start to shudder and shift, as though something large was stuck within its ceramic walls.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of them screamed then, a resounding chorus of fear, as a clawed hand erupted from the earth, leading to a bent elbow, before an entire body was birthed from deep within the plant pot in a contorted mess, spilling out onto the polished floor amongst a cascade of dark soil. The body continued to bend and crack into place, until to all of their surprise, Rio was stood before them with a broad smile on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What’s up guys!” She greeted with a wave, cricking her neck one final time with a horrendous crack, “did’ya miss me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Rio!
     </i>
     ” Jen shouted, eyes wide, horrified at what she had just born witness to, “you scared the shit out of us!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t look disturbed by this revelation, in fact she looked thrilled by it, “I did?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, you asshole,” Alice sniped, before waving a hand at Rio’s entire person, as though trying to make sense of her sudden presence, “where the hell have you been? And why did you use a plant instead of the
     <i>
      fucking door?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s expression remained blank, “you mean that wasn’t the door?” She pointed behind her at the plant pot, now cracked open with soil spilling from it, and the tree it once held securely leaning precariously against the wall, it’s knotted roots exposed to the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sensing they weren’t going to get any answers from the green witch, Agatha hadn’t been able to after all, so the others
     <i>
      certainly
     </i>
     wouldn’t, Agatha gestured for them to resume their search for the trial’s starting point, “she’s a tourist guys, ignore her. Keep looking”.
    </p>
    <p>
     With muted grumbling they did so, drifting away in pairs to recommence their hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook the soil from her body and glanced down, humming slightly at her new clothing which was a frustratingly attractive blue dress, skin tight and crafted from a mixed medium of solid silk and sheer tulle, the fabric decorated decadently with small silver disks and partially draping over Rio’s head too, creating a hood that gave her outfit a sharp, mysterious edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stylish,” she commented to herself, eyes drifting up from reviewing her own clothing to study Agatha, who was still stood in the centre of the room, arms crossed tightly across her chest, glaring at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes widened the moment they traced Agatha’s outfit, evidently appreciating the low-cut neckline, and flares that were so tightly moulded to her hips the curve of her body was on evident display.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whistled appreciatively, “you look to die for sweetheart”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still utterly furious at Rio for leaving, and for insisting on holding her secrets so tightly to her chest, even though Agatha
     <i>
      knew
     </i>
     , maybe not literally, but at least deep down inside herself, that those secrets were
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     business too, she didn’t respond. Instead, she tilted her chin upwards and strode away, determined to finish the damned Road, even if Rio wasn’t taking it seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stalked through a darkened doorway toward the back of the house, which turned out to be a recording booth, decked out with a full studio bench covered in buttons and dials, a trolley full of old-school microphones, and two padded chairs on wheels, one of which she slumped into with her eyes closed, needing a minute to sort through her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, Rio had kept her word. She had indeed come back.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that still left the gaping black hole of a question as to
     <i>
      where she had gone?
     </i>
     And as to what had been so damn urgent it couldn’t wait a few days?
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, there were two more questions to add to the ever-growing pile of queries she had regarding the beautiful stranger who had lived in Agnes's house for a year.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind settled into that period of time, once more trying to scan through the red haze of magic that covered Agnes’s memories, hunting for something, something else,
     <i>
      anything
     </i>
     at all, that might give her a clue or a hint as to just who Rio Vidal was to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flashes of instances rushed past her minds eye the longer she pondered it, highlighting an array of moments.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were ample domestic scenes: Rio laughing at the television whilst shoving handfuls of popcorn into her mouth; Rio making them both coffee; Rio holding Señor Scratchy close to her face, finding comfort in the warmth of his soft fur.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was an abundance of memories consisting of Agnes lusting after her roommate too, each one a snapshot moment focussing on a particular feature or trait Agnes had found painfully appealing: toned arms pushing the lawnmower; Rio grinning, wide and feral with a streak of soil across one cheek; Rio guiding Agnes with a steady palm on her lower back through a door she was holding open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before finally, another memory started to drift into her consciousness. It was an important one, one that had been hidden beneath the layers of other less poignant memories.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the moment she had awoken as Agnes following her battle with Wanda. A scene she had revisited before yes, yet now it had returned with a starker clarity, one that included audio, audio of the exact sentence that had passed from Rio to Agnes upon waking.
    </p>
    <p>
     The words resounded in her mind, spinning around and sharpening her already ravenous intrigue, prompting her to sit up straight in her chair, feeling quite suddenly, as though she was on the cusp of a breakthrough.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s voice had been dark, filled with grief, and wet with unshed tears, “
     <i>
      I’ll get you back my love, I swear it. And then, once I know you are safe and yourself once again, I will find the scarlet witch and she will learn that there are far worse fates than simply dying
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll get you
     <i>
      back?
     </i>
     ” She mumbled to herself, staring down at the bright carpet The Road had outfitted the recording booth with, not seeing it at all for how deep she had ventured into her own memories, “be
     <i>
      yourself
     </i>
     once again?” She whispered, repeating out loud each prevalent point from the memory she had just unearthed, “the
     <i>
      scarlet witch?!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her teeth clenched tightly as she realised who exactly Rio had been referring to, of course, who else would it be;
     <i>
      Wanda Maximoff
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Her spiralling thoughts, and all the connections she was drawing too, were all promptly interrupted by Rio darkening the recording booth’s doorway with a wary, “knock, knock”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still running on the high of remembering the details of such a pivotal moment, she locked Rio’s gaze with her own and repeated, with a tone verging on accusatory, the green witch’s words back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      I’ll get you back my love, I swear it. And then, once I know you are safe and yourself once again, I will find the scarlet witch and she will learn that there are far worse fates than simply dying
     </i>
     ”. Pausing a moment, she watched Rio’s brow drop with confusion, evidently not recognising the sentence nor its origins, “that’s what you said to me. When I first woke up as Agnes, you were crying, your head was bowed over my hands, and you said those
     <i>
      exact words
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She allowed the silence to swell, wanting Rio to feel the discomfort of it pressing against her, to feel the trap that had been set and how it was now tightening, limiting her opportunities to evade Agatha’s questions any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio however, much to Agatha's frustration, didn’t flinch or cringe, or have any other number of reactions Agatha had anticipated she might. No, instead the only giveaway Agatha’s words had impacted her at all was the slightest twitch of her mouth, as she did what Agatha was discovering to be an unconscious habit, and stuck her tongue into the inside of her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could feel her impatience rising at the lack of reaction from Rio, fuelling her to throw both hands up in exasperation, “well? Nothing to say?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally Rio reacted. She sighed heavily and closed the door behind her, sealing them in the recording booth together and took a few steps closer. To Agatha’s surprise though, she looked more concerned than caught, almost wary as she studied Agatha’s face, eyes flickering from her eyes to her chin and back again, as though scanning it for a detail Agatha was unaware she possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, what do you want me to say Agatha?” Rio's voice when she finally spoke was subdued,  like she was trying to talk down the ramblings of an insane person.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s temper flared, both at Rio’s consistent attempts to avoid providing her with any clarity, but also at the insult of being spoken to in such a way, as though Agatha should doubt the validity of her own memories.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hissing through clenched teeth, Agatha shot to her feet. The wheelie chair she had been sat on shot towards the wall from just how quickly she had stood, and Rio too stumbled backwards as Agatha swept closer, herding her against the bench of dials and buttons with a sharp finger that she jabbed into her chest, directly over her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You had better start talking, or even without magic I’ll make you sorry if you don’t,” her lip curled as she spat her threat in Rio's face, “what the hell did you mean by ‘
     <i>
      getting me back?
     </i>
     ’ and what the fuck did you mean by when I’m ‘
     <i>
      myself
     </i>
     ’ again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face remained passive, although she exhaled gently, relaxing her body to lean back against the bench behind her. Agatha’s eyes flickered across her face, once again seeing her son in her features; in the shape of her eyes, the slope of her nose, the colour of her hair, and the tone of her skin.
     <i>
      All of it
     </i>
     was Nicky,
     <i>
      all of it
     </i>
     was her darling boy, yet this woman was a
     <i>
      stranger.
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     Or
     <i>
      was she?
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     Was that the secret? Was that what Rio had meant by getting her
     <i>
      love
     </i>
     back? Was that why Rio desired vengeance on the Scarlet Witch?
    </p>
    <p>
     Had something else been taken from her? Aside from her own agency, had Wanda stolen some of her past too, some of her soul. Had she
     <i>
      stolen
     </i>
     Nicky’s other parent from her mind?
    </p>
    <p>
     The finger she was stabbing into Rio's chest softened it's attack before hardening again, although this time it was her entire fist as she grabbed tightly to the collar of Rio’s dress, needing a physical link to the present as a wave of connections and possibilities swept through her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Who
     </i>
     was Nicky’s other parent?
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind started to hum under the strain of searching for answer, an answer she was sure that had been there before, but was now shrouded from her, as though someone had pulled a curtain across the truth, hiding it from view.
    </p>
    <p>
     Did he even
     <i>
      have
     </i>
     another parent?
    </p>
    <p>
     She squeezed her eyes tightly together.
    </p>
    <p>
     The answer became clear then, like the glow of a lantern through fog;
     <i>
      Yes
     </i>
     .
     <i>
      Yes he did
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     She had named him Scratch, Nicholas Scratch. For he was a child conceived without a seed, he had been born of
     <i>
      two
     </i>
     mothers, he had been made from
     <i>
      scratch
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes widened with horror as the reality of what Wanda had stolen from her settled in her fatigued mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     That same, familiar pain started to pound in the back of her mind, in the same place it had earlier when she had been arguing with Jen about the Ballad’s correct lyrics, and the time before that too, when she had lost her temper and raged at Rio for keeping so many secrets. Rio’s expression finally shifted, as alarm cloaked her features. Quickly, both of her hands shot out to hold Agatha’s waist, supporting her weight as her knees buckled beneath her from the waves of agony suddenly echoing around her skull.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Rio’s voice was tight with worry and sharp as a whip, “you need to
     <i>
      stop
     </i>
     . You need to
     <i>
      stop
     </i>
     trying to figure this out! I mean it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clenched her eyes tightly together, trying to centre her thoughts even through the sparking pain emanating from her mind, “then tell me the truth! And I can stop trying!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s fingers flexed on her waist, “I can’t!” She thundered, sounding for the first time since Agatha had met her genuinely panicked, “I can’t! I don’t know what will happen if I do! You’re already in pain just trying to think about it! Fuck knows what will happen if I tell you
     <i>
      everything!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha forced her mind to clear and inhaled deeply, feeling relief trickle in like cold water on a dry, burning throat as the pain finally started to recede.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright,” she eventually whispered, panting hard from experiencing such agony. She could concede that there was a definitive connection between Rio’s secrets, and the ache that would pierce through her head the moment she thought about them in too much detail, “alright, I’ll stop”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed, evidently relieved that Agatha had agreed to stop digging for anymore information. And if Agatha were in a better mood, she would have snorted in amusement at Rio thinking such an absurd thought, because as much as she could admit the two things were indeed connected, it certainly wouldn’t prevent her from hunting for the truth she desired to possess. No, it just meant she would have to find a route through to the truth without triggering whatever magic was holding her thoughts captive.
    </p>
    <p>
     For one important fact, after all, was as obvious as Rio standing directly in front of her. Yes, it was clear that she could ponder these questions and theories to a certain degree, at which point the pain would start and her mind would blur.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, she would have to learn as much as she could whilst simply
     <i>
      skimming
     </i>
     for answers, and by keeping away from any depth of details.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had remained quiet and still whilst holding Agatha up, having been supporting her weight this entire time. It was obvious she thought Agatha needed a moment following the pain she had just endured, not that Agatha was actively plotting a way through the very maze Rio held a map of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shifted slightly, evidently intent on slipping from between Agatha and the booth to head back to the others. Yet, Agatha slid sideways with her, keeping her caged against the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have an idea,” she said quickly, “how about I ask you a few questions, and you give me a few answers”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes, “I already told you,
     <i>
      I can’t
     </i>
     . You nearly collapse-”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh-uh,” Agatha placed the hand not clutching Rio’s collar tightly over her mouth, silencing her instantly, “you can give me a few yes-or-no answers, that much shouldn’t cause my head to implode”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s glare grew hotter, enraged at the image Agatha painted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sensing she had the ability to persuade this particular witch though, Agatha dragged the hand covering Rio’s mouth to hold her chin instead. Gently, she tilted Rio’s head down so she could lock their gazes together and stare imploringly, “please”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s stubborn frown remained on her face for several loaded moments before, after another exhausted sigh, she closed her eyes and nodded once, “fine. You can ask a
     <i>
      few
     </i>
     . But if you wince even once, I’m pulling the plug
     <i>
      immediately
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha beamed with victory and allowed her hand to drop from Rio’s jaw to the side of her throat, where she started to brush her fingers against the hot skin above her pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s expression morphed into an apprehensive one as she awaited the first question, and Agatha couldn’t help but wonder if her hesitance stemmed from purely trying to ensure Agatha’s wellbeing, or whether their relationship, the one she couldn’t remember, had a whole host of skeleton's she was unaware of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deciding to get right down to business, Agatha started with the most obvious question.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know you, don’t I? Even though I can’t remember you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s lip trembled slightly before she whispered, “yes”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed, dragging her fingertips from Rio’s pulse to the hollow of her throat, “and I’m guessing Wanda is the reason I can’t remember you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     A spark of anger flashed in Rio’s eyes at the reminder, before it simmered into something gentler, “yes. Yes she is”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha found her throat tightening, surprised at the weight she felt in her chest at having her suspicions confirmed, at knowing Wanda stole so much more than a single year of her life. “And you-,” she swallowed heavily, desperately searching for the fortitude to ask her next question and broach a topic she usually kept safely tucked beneath her heart, “and you- you… know my son?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyebrows lifted slightly, even as her eyes softened, clearly understanding that Agatha was struggling with the concept of discussing her son with a woman she didn’t know. Even if all the evidence was pointing to that very same woman being his other mother.
    </p>
    <p>
     She nodded slowly, eyes intent upon Agatha’s as her fingers tightened on the dip of her waist, “I do”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha closed her eyes, causing a single tear to glide down her face. The brush of a soft thumb followed as Rio wiped it away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her next breath shuddered from between her lips, and she felt her body melting even further against Rio’s. It was fuelled by a sudden urge, almost desperate in it's potency to feel her close, as though her body on it’s own recognised Rio and knew it would find comfort in her embrace. It turned out her body had been right too, for Rio was quick to wrap both her arms around Agatha’s waist and hold her tight, supporting her without question.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyes opened slowly and she studied Rio’s face, desperately trying to recall it’s image from the depths of her memories; the memories that weren’t marred by scarlet stains but the older ones, the ones as old as her love for her son.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she was met with nothing but silence. It felt like she was lost in a blizzard in her own mind, calling out for an answer that never came.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she asked another question, raising her hand from Rio’s throat to brush soft fingertips against the plump give of Rio’s mouth, “and you matter to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned, evidently unsure on how to answer that particular question before she shook her head once to the negative, “no-,” she started to answer before immediately tilting her jaw in a gesture of uncertainty. “Honestly…” she sighed, a sound that personified yearning, as her eyes flickered across Agatha’s face, trying to divine an answer from her features, as though they might whisper a covert answer to her without Agatha’s awareness, “I don’t actually know”.
    </p>
    <p>
     That response was the most surprising to Agatha yet, because she had never, in all her long years, ever felt quite so bothered by another person before. And by bothered, she meant protective, possessive, and hungry, amongst many other raging emotions that had continually fired off within her since waking up to find a sleep-tousled Rio standing in Agnes's kitchen. So it simply didn’t make sense how Rio
     <i>
      couldn’t
     </i>
     matter, when Agatha’s reaction to her, even now, was so strong.
    </p>
    <p>
     She packed that answer away with the others, ready to pick it up later and turn it over in her mind until the truth revealed itself to her, and asked another.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where did you go? Why is whatever it is you do, so important you had to leave
     <i>
      The Road
     </i>
     of all places,” her frown deepened, “more so, how did you even
     <i>
      leave
     </i>
     The Road in the first place?”
    </p>
    <p>
     A small smirk blossomed on Rio’s face, “now those weren’t yes-or-no questions, were they?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Scowling, Agatha tried to think of the best way to rephrase her queries but found herself coming up short. Feeling petulant at the realisation, she pouted and looped both arms around Rio’s neck, trying to look innocently imploring as she bit her lip, “you won’t tell me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk slid slowly from her face and was replaced by a troubled expression, like clouds drifting in front of sunlight, “I don’t think I should tell you anymore than I have. We’re already pushing our luck talking about it, I don’t want to hurt you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes narrowed, “well, I figured out this much already. It’s only a matter of time until I get the rest from you,” she smirked, “I can wait”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A bark of laughter escaped Rio’s throat, “
     <i>
      you
     </i>
     can wait?
     <i>
      You?
     </i>
     The least patient witch I have ever met?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I’m sure I can think of some effective persuasion techniques to try out,” Agatha quipped, eyebrows rising puckishly. And as she spoke, she became even more conscious of their current position, of the fact she was practically standing between Rio’s thighs, who she had pushed against the bench so tightly it was now holding her up. Rio’s hands were warm on her waist, her own hands were looped around Rio’s neck, and their faces were close, exchanging words only a mere inch from one another’s lips, as though they needed to feel the exhalation of them in order to comprehend their meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
     She dipped her eyes down slowly, taking in Rio's outfit again, now she was less furious with her…
     <i>
      friend? Ex? Current-girlfriend-who-she couldn’t-remember-because-of-chaos-magic?
     </i>
     Noticing once more just how low Rio’s dress dipped, and how it was almost an exact match in length to her own jacket's plunging neckline.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, the impulse to press their chests together, to feel Rio’s skin against hers and to feel the vibration of her heartbeat echo throughout her own ribcage overcame her, and without delay or question she did so, tightening her grip on Rio’s neck until their torso’s were intimately aligned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gasped at the sensation and her hands slipped from Agatha’s waist to the dip of her lower back, holding her in place as her eyes closed softly, her expression as serene as petals drifting to float on a still pond.
    </p>
    <p>
     “See,” Agatha whispered, drawing closer to Rio’s ear so her words could be breathed against sensitive skin, “I’ve already got you exactly where I want you. I’ll get the rest out of you eventually, just you wait and see”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s responding expression was amused, as though Agatha’s words had a level of irony to them that Agatha was blind to. Rio didn’t say anything in reply though, instead she leant in and pressed a soft kiss to Agatha’s lips, as though having her as close as she did, Rio couldn’t quite resist the temptation of doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed and immediately welcomed the kiss, running one of her hands upwards to thread into Rio’s hair, uncaring of messing up the hairstyle The Road had chosen for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     A tender feeling stole across Agatha’s heart then, one she wasn’t familiar with, or perhaps she
     <i>
      was
     </i>
     familiar with it but it too, like her memories, had been stolen from her mind by a wave of scarlet magic.
    </p>
    <p>
     The reactive panic that seemed to swell in her stomach whenever she felt herself feeling a bit too enamoured with Rio, was promptly quelled from forming though by a series of loud, resounding bangs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both of them jerked away from one another, turning swiftly to source the origin of the noise which turned out to be Jen and Alice, who were stood on the other side of the recording booth's window, their hands raised to slap against the glass. They wore matching expressions, one that changed the longer they stood there staring at Rio and Agatha, turning quickly from absurd shock to knowing smirks, as though neither of them were all that surprised to have found the pair of them wrapped up together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cleared her throat, pulled her jacket down and strode from the recording booth with her chin tilted up arrogantly. Rio followed, although her stance and stride remained relaxed, completely unphased to have been caught making out like a pair of teenagers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Surprise, surprise,
     </i>
     ” Jen drawled the moment they were once again in the main room and within hearing distance of one another, “
     <i>
      Agatha Harkness
     </i>
     is digging her claws in to the next available witch she finds,
     <i>
      shocker
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sniffed derisively as she looked Jen up and down, “what’s the problem? You jealous?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen scoffed as her arms crossed tightly across her chest, “of you maybe, not Rio”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio appeared by her side, grin wide and wild as she comprehended Jen’s meaning, “oh yeah, is that right Kale?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's jealousy was quick to bloom in reaction to this particular interaction, especially after the truth’s she had just discovered. So, in a bid to shut it down as quickly as it had started, she grabbed Rio’s hand and dragged her away from Jen and closer to Teen, who was in the process of setting up a record on an old-fashioned player.
    </p>
    <p>
     He smiled at them as they approached, before placing the needle gently on the spinning disk. Immediately, a disturbing, drawling noise erupted from the record player, one that caused a spike of fear to burst up from her stomach through her lungs, stealing her breath with the horror it instilled in her body; a primal, instinctual terror.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry!” Teen cried, hands over his ears, “I thought it was a clue!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What made you think
     <i>
      that?
     </i>
     ” Agatha yelled over the noise, staring at the record cover he held up that immediately answered her question, for upon it’s front in large, black print the words, ‘
     <b>
      PLAY ME
     </b>
     ’ were imposed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s spinning backwards,” she realised, as both Jen and Alice cried at her to put an end to the hellish racket. Without requiring any further prompting, Agatha grabbed the entire player, ripped it from the table it was resting on and threw it on the ground. The noise dimmed slightly, but didn’t stop, so she stormed closer and drove the heel of her boot into it several times, not stopping until they were once again enveloped by silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ve been cursed,” Lilia said, voice low with despair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, a methodical ticking resounded out, like the flicker of a clock. Spinning again, Agatha saw it was a metronome set on the piano that had started ticking, just as Rio pointed at it and said, rather unhelpfully and with a large, excited grin, “I think this means the trial's started”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen scowled at her, “why are you smiling?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I told you before, she’s a tourist,” Agatha sniped, finding Rio’s lack of fear both amusing, and the start of yet another curious stream of questions about this woman she apparently knew, but couldn’t remember.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s a psycho,” Jen immediately shot back, a disturbed expression on her face before flinching away the moment Rio nodded in agreement, eyes wide and wild.
    </p>
    <p>
     Screaming suddenly made them all jump a second time, for Lilia had dropped to the ground, writhing in pain as smoke started to sizzle from the skin of her shoulders, “
     <i>
      it burns! It burns!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was the first to react, snatching Rio’s knife from her hand with one clean swipe, so she could draw a circle of protection around Lilia, who only sighed with relief the moment she was entirely enclosed within protective charm.
    </p>
    <p>
     A debate quickly followed as they threw back and forth different ideas on how to tackle this particular curse, however once more their conversation jerked to a violent halt the moment Jen started to scream in pain, much like Lilia had.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice drew another circle, protecting Jen from whatever evil was currently circling them, waiting for an opportunity to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s you isn’t it?” Agatha grabbed Alice’s shoulders, shaking her slightly to emphasise the urgency of her question, “you brought it in here”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Leave her alone Agatha!” Teen tried to intervene, but Alice was already crumbling, opening up and revealing her own dark truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn’t think it was real. I thought it was me, that it was my fault that I cant keep a job, that everything I touch turns to
     <i>
      shit
     </i>
     , that I couldn’t save her”. She drew her hair away from her shoulder, her hands shaking as she did so, “I convinced myself they were birthmarks. Even though she had the same ones”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait,” Jen interrupted, voice sharp, “are we talking about a
     <i>
      generational curse?!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you poor thing,” Lilia crooned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Poor us!
     </i>
     ” Jen argued, “now we have her family’s old-ass curse!”
    </p>
    <p>
     A gust of wind preceded the demon’s next attack, as it swiftly lifted Teen from his feet and threw him across the room, right into the window of the recording booth, which his body smashed through with a violent, shattering bang.
    </p>
    <p>
     Much to her own surprise, Agatha was one of the first through the booth’s door, her concern for Teen a confounding addition to her newfound concern for Rio. She paused by the door, allowing Alice to be the one to approach and actually offer him comfort, aware of her own shortcomings when it came to that particular ability.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart released from the fist it had tightened into the moment she saw him sitting up, a small, pained smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning with a relieved sigh, she returned to the centre of the room, throwing Jen a condescending glare for having not moved an inch toward the Teenager who might have been bleeding out in the sound booth, “so what, you live in that circle now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe,” Jen sniped back defensively.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt Rio’s warmth by her side, “what’s the plan Agatha?” She tilted her head towards the metronome, “time’s ticking”.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha had hardly heard Rio’s second warning, for her attention had fallen on Alice, who was staring at the piano with a fearful furrow to her brow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re right,” she pointed at Alice, capturing her attention, “that’s the solution”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, it’s
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     ,” Alice insisted, shaking her head and taking hurried steps away from the instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We have to play Lorna’s Ballad,” Agatha said, staring imploringly at Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not playing that song!” Alice said, voice stern.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gestured around them before putting her hands on her hips, “all signs point to a jam session”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice continued to prevaricate, wasting valuable time they did not have whilst refusing to sing the song her mother had crafted into a protection spell for
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     . The urgency of the moment was compounded however when the curse started to scream, it’s horrifying cry echoing around the room in great echoing shrieks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay! Who’s good on piano?! Lilia?!” Agatha asked, unwilling to take no for answer any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. No, I studied the zils,” Lilia said, a small proud smirk on her face, “and a little pan flute”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, Jen?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ballet,” was the resolute answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her patience was down to it’s final thread, so she quickly barked an order for Jen to take up the bass, for Teen to play guitar, Alice the piano, and Lilia… whatever instrument took her fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took centre stage, gripping the microphone, just as she noticed Rio settling behind the drum-set without needing to be told. A flare of attraction bloomed in her stomach, one at Rio being so fucking good at knowing exactly what Agatha needed from her, sometimes before even Agatha knew, and two, at just how good she looked behind a damn drum-kit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shaking her head, aware that now really wasn’t the time to start lusting after a possible situationship she had no memory of, she pointed at Alice, “play it right, play it well, and maybe we won’t die”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      I have learned the lesson, of all that’s foul and fair…
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     The tune starts slowly, as Lorna had designed it to, but it built well and after a shaky thirty seconds the entire coven settled into the rhythm of the familiar melody. It was fortunate Alice could play the piano, as it was clear she was the spine of the entire song. Although credit where it was due, Rio was doing an exceptional job at keeping them all on beat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha soon found herself doing what she did best; performing, and other than the moment her own shoulders were scorched with burning claws, forcing her to grit her teeth through the pain, she found a peaceful distraction in singing the song she had written with her own son, a song that another mother had used to protect her own child.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tune built toward its natural climax as Alice played and sung like their lives depended on it, which they did. And as the final note echoed around them, the curse that had burdened Alice’s family for generations was finally engulfed by its own flame, burning in it's entirety with a shrill shriek, until all that remained was a scattering of ash surrounding Alice’s piano stool.
    </p>
    <p>
     A tense silence shrouded them then, until at long last, the metronome stopped its infernal ticking, and the piano lid swung open like a trapdoor, revealing their way out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although the jubilation at their success was cut short the moment Teen, now covered in blood and staring at the shard of glass piercing his stomach, dropped heavily to the floor with a resounding thump.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     She had needed a moment. A few minutes to herself to breath, to recover from that painfully familiar maternal fear that had overtaken her the moment she had spotted the blood spreading across Teen’s shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was fine. He was resting. He was being mouthy again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She reiterated these thoughts to herself, wandering away from the fire that the others had settled themselves around, all of them sharing stories of scars long-since healed, and laughing loudly at each other’s humourous anecdotes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had joined them briefly, had even shared a story about the scar on her elbow, but the comradery they all fell into so easily made her uncomfortable. It made her itch.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was a covenless witch, that was who she was. Not just through choice but by design. After all, her gift had never allowed for anything else, because what witch in their right mind would truly trust a sister-witch that could draw every last pulsing ounce of life from their body.
    </p>
    <p>
     So it was easier to draw away, to separate herself and cut herself off from tasting what she knew she could never have. Better that, than to experience it and fool herself into thinking it might be something she actually wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, she found a small glade that was far enough away from the others she could no longer hear them, nor see the flames of the fire keeping them warm flickering in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a heavy sigh, she closed her eyes and leant backwards against the broad trunk of a scraggly tree. It’s branches were full and draping, creating a curtain of foliage that separated Agatha even further from her makeshift coven, providing her with the curtain of solitude she was craving.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, her peace didn’t last long, because moments later she heard the rustle of movement, and after opening her eyes found a flat palm in front of her nose, on which a single flower lay, it’s bright petals standing in stark contrast to the skin it was resting upon.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You found me,” Agatha murmured, lifting a hand to accept the offered flower. Her own reaction surprised her, for although it had been solitude she had been hunting for, she found the fact this particular witch had followed her into the trees a pleasant surprise. One that didn’t rekindle the claustrophobia she had felt beside the fire with all of the others and their forced joviality.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I did,” Rio agreed, as her cheeks twitched up into a smirk, “I always do”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stared at her; eyebrows furrowed, for she was sure that statement was loaded with context she should understand. Suddenly, the opportunity to learn more became clear and she couldn’t resist probing for more information, “is that so?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yep,” Rio confirmed, voice flippant and short, almost intentionally. Whether it was to irritate her, or just because Rio knew it wasn’t safe for Agatha to ask these sorts of questions, she couldn’t quite tell.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you always seem to manage finding your way back to me after disappearing... just like you did earlier,” she raised a pointed eyebrow, “ready to tell me more about that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin was mischievous as she leant her body against Agatha’s, trapping her against the tree. Rio didn’t answer her question, choosing instead to bow her head beneath Agatha’s jaw so she could run hungry lips up the side of her throat. The sensation made Agatha gasp in surprise as her back arched into Rio’s body, yearning to be closer, and to feel the entirety of her body pressed against her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know what your trying to do,” Agatha managed to breathe out, words ragged through her shortness of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could feel Rio’s sharp teeth against her pulse as her grin broadened, “you do?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned then, because seconds after asking her question, Rio opened her jaw and bit down on the pulse she had been kissing only moments before, “yes, I-” Agatha's response was interrupted by another husky groan, as the need her body felt started to burn almost painfully, “you’re try- trying to d-distract me from asking any more questions”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s lips journeyed down even further, focussing on the bare skin between her open collar, branding Agatha’s flushed chest and collarbones with lingering, open-mouthed kisses and small nips with sharp teeth, “is it working?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scowled at the confirmation, even as she pushed her chest closer to Rio’s ravenous mouth and threaded her fingers through her hair to hold her close. “Might be,” she conceded grudgingly before tightening a fist in Rio’s hair to drag her mouth up from her chest, so she could claim it properly. Rio whimpered into the kiss the moment their lips met, her hands drifting from Agatha’s waist down to her ass, where they grabbed greedy handfuls to haul their hips closer together. Agatha drew back slightly, panting heavily and through a smirk managed to husk, “although, I have an idea that would definitely distract me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her need was overwhelming then as she dragged her hands down to Rio’s, which were still greedily palming at her ass, grasped her wrists with steady fingers and guided them towards the button of her pants.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes locked as their chests heaved and the heat in Agatha’s stomach burned even hotter the moment she saw that spark of power, that dangerous thread of something
     <i>
      other
     </i>
     flash in Rio’s eyes, as though she were so tempted by what Agatha was offering that her mask had dropped momentarily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio allowed it; allowed Agatha to guide her hands to the button holding her pants up, allowed Agatha to lead them through the motions of sliding the button through the buttonhole, of slowly, almost painfully so, gliding the zipper down. She even allowed Agatha to push her fingers down even further, until they had slid, as smoothly and with the ease of covering familiar ground, passed the material of Agatha’s pants to rest between the lace of her underwear and her flushed skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     However it was then, just as her fingers trembled right above where Agatha needed them most, that Rio froze, and would have jerked backwards completely if Agatha hadn’t caught her by the waist to prevent her from doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio clenched her eyes tightly together, and Agatha could see the strain in her jaw, could feel it too, in the hand in her underwear, now tense with indecision.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agatha
     </i>
     ,” she ground out, as though her desire was causing her physical pain, “I- I don’t know if we should-”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her lust boil then, turning almost molten with frustration at the thought of Rio stopping right now, “
     <i>
      why?
     </i>
     ” Her voice was husky with need, “why shouldn’t we? I want you; you want me. We’re both adults”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She drew closer and claimed Rio’s mouth, tempting her to open her jaw even further with an enticing flick of her tongue, so she could imprint her desire into Rio’s mouth, before drawing away to stare up at her with dark eyes and swollen lips. She pressed a hand over Rio’s which was still buried beneath her underwear. Though still hadn’t moved an inch closer to where Agatha needed to feel her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I-” Rio exhaled a ragged, hungry breath before pulling her hand from Agatha’s pants and slowly drawing the zipper back up and re-buttoning them, “I can’t”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, Rio,
     <i>
      please
     </i>
     ,” Agatha could cry from how frustrated she felt, a burn that felt even more potent now she was so close to feeling the carnal satisfaction her body was so desperately ravenous for. Her hands scrabbled at Rio’s trying to stop her from moving away any further. “
     <i>
      Why?
     </i>
     ” She despised the desperation in her own voice, but couldn’t find the strength to stop it from being painfully obvious, “I know you, my body knows you, my heart knows you, I know you matter to me, I can feel it,
     <i>
      here
     </i>
     ,” she grabbed Rio’s retreating hands and dragged them up to rest against her heart, “I want you, so badly, why are you so afraid of this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s chuckle was self-deprecating, a sound filled with mourning, “I'm not
     <i>
      afraid
     </i>
     Agatha, I’m-” her eyes drew upward and locked onto Agatha’s own. A small, pained smile appeared on her face, “I want to, I want nothing more than to touch you, to feel you-”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Then do it!
     </i>
     ” Agatha’s voice was sharp with frustration and impatience, instantly she tried to drag one of Rio’s hands back down towards her waistband, “do it, touch me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio resisted and lifted the hand away from Agatha’s pants to cradle her jaw instead, “I can’t because I know, as much as it pains me to admit, that you, the
     <i>
      you
     </i>
     who knows me, wouldn’t necessarily want this”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha frowned, startled from her lust by that particularly jarring revelation, “
     <i>
      I wouldn’t?
     </i>
     ” She stared at Rio, dragging her eyes up her entire body to settle on her beautiful face, “is the me who knows you
     <i>
      clinically insane?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled, dropping her brow to rest on Agatha’s shoulder, “I agree, she must be,” she drew back to look into her face again, “but it is, unfortunately, the truth. And I won’t take advantage of having our history erased from your mind,” she sighed heavily and ran a hand down Agatha’s hair, tucking a loose, wayward lock behind her ear, “as much as I might want to. I can’t”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha exhaled heavily, resentfully accepting Rio’s words as she slumped back against the tree, “so what? You’re never going to touch me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled at her petulance, “I will. When you get your memories back and you recall this moment, if you still want me to touch you, the horde’s of hell won't be able to stop me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, she drew closer a final time, captured Agatha’s mouth in a furious kiss, a kiss that merely hinted at the passion brewing beneath Rio’s skin, before drawing back, leaving Agatha flushed and breathless, slumped against the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on,” Rio said, tugging gently on Agatha’s hand to lead her back toward the fire, “we need to get some sleep”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, dazed from the kiss she had just been branded with, and the dissatisfied hunger still burning in her stomach, allowed herself to be guided away from the tree as a pout bloomed on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright fine. But just a heads up, If you keep kissing me like
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     , I won’t be liable for my own actions”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A bark of laughter escaped Rio’s throat, amused at Agatha’s petulance, as she drew Agatha’s hand upward to press a kiss to the back of it before murmuring an amused, “noted".
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio led her back to the others in silence, where the moment they slipped down to lay on soil warmed by the fire, Agatha grabbed Rio’s arm and pulled it over her waist, so the curve of Rio’s body bracketed her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt Rio settle behind her and couldn’t resist pushing her ass teasingly into the cradle of Rio’s hips, “goodnight
     <i>
      Sister Rio
     </i>
     ,” Agatha snarked over her shoulder, feeling particularly nun-like for the first time in three hundred years, “if you wake up with dark and devious urges,
     <i>
      please
     </i>
     don’t hesitate to wake me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the last thing she heard before sleep claimed her was a quiet chuckle, as a warm arm tightened around her waist, holding her close, holding her tight.

     <b>
      AGATHA
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's journey from the gentle darkness of sleep to the disorientation of wakefulness happened in a single jarring lurch. Her eyes were the first body part to react, widening suddenly to take stock of her current situation and remind herself of exactly where she was and precisely who she was with.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her slow-to-respond senses eventually combined enough to report the following: she was laying on leaf-litter above cool, compacted earth. The fire directly in her eyeline had burnt itself out, smouldering down to mere embers that were glowing red amongst a bed of dusty ash. Rio’s warm body was behind her own, their embrace anchored by Rio’s arm which was tucked tightly around Agatha's waist, which she had made sure remained so with a firm grip of her own around Rio’s wrist. The green witch’s body was relaxed, and still deep asleep like all the others, none of whom had jarred awake like Agatha had only a few moments earlier, when what had felt like a small earthquake had jolted her back into full consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sitting up slowly, so as not to disturb Rio, she guided the other witch's arm down to lay on the ground, which was still warm from Agatha’s body heat, and slowly got to her feet. She muffled a slight groan at a complaining ache in her lower back, one born from lying on the cold, hard ground and stretched it out as she took quiet steps away, intending on checking the perimeter of their makeshift camp to ensure nothing untoward or dangerous was lying in wait.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Road was as silent as it always was, with not even a breeze to disturb the fallen foliage or cause bare branches to rustle as they would in a more natural place. It was a disturbing silence, one so deep that she took pause when whispers started to drift across the air towards her, shrill whispers from hissing voices spitting only two words;
     <i>
      Agatha Harkness
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     She halted for a brief moment, straining her ears to make certain that the words she could hear on the wind were indeed reality, and not just the result of a tired mind, one that had been quite badly abused by chaos magic in recent months.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her concerns were cemented as genuine though the moment she heard a single feral shriek followed by a command to “
     <i>
      find her. Find them all!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Requiring no further prompting, she turned tail and sprinted back toward the fire, only to overhear the end of a conversation that was already underway. A conversation that apparently revolved around her, and her dark history with the Salem Seven; a story of how the gift of clemency had been repaid with ravenous, violent pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The moral of the story kids is always finish what you start! Also, mercy is overrated. All right, everybody, pack up your shit!
     <i>
      Let’s go!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     For once, her coven assembled quickly, efficiently, and without argument, as each of them immediately started to sprint after her down The Road. They ran for several long, tense moments before a shriek resounded from just down the way, their view of which was blocked by a rocky bank that a web of thick roots were crisscrossing over, each one winding down amongst the stone to reach the soil below.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That was ahead of us,” Jen warned, as they all span around, intent on turning back on themselves to source another route through. Only they were forced to stop again when another feral scream echoed from behind them, trapping them on a very narrow stretch of Road.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s behind us!” Alice mirrored.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tension mounted as they all started to look around, hunting for an exit, or any means of defending themselves, when suddenly Teen’s voice broke through the panic, anchoring them all to reality with his ridiculous suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about a hexenbesen?”
    </p>
    <p>
     And with that question spoken aloud, like a pin to a balloon, the atmosphere deflated from one of fright to one of bickering disbelief, as Agatha, Jen, Alice, and Lilia all groaned out pained refusals. Rio, on the other hand looked thrilled and pointed at Teen in eager agreement, “Yes!” She insisted, flicking her hand at him to emphasise her categorical support for him and his suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s a terrible idea!” Agatha insisted, scowling at even the notion of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Yes!
     </i>
     ” Rio said again with another determined point toward Teen, staring directly at Agatha in stubborn opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, if you’re all too cool for a practical means of escape!” Teen quipped, evidently annoyed his plan was being disparaged so quickly and so openly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Any further arguments were promptly cut off by a loud screech, one that sounded far closer than any of the others had before.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Brooms are great!” Alice said, as she rushed closer to one of the stone banks bordering them, and started to rip a large root from the rock's scarred face. Each of them were quick to follow, hauling different roots and plants together to build a broom for their fellow witch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, Agatha started to pull vines of ivy down from a rocky ledge, with the understanding a hexenbesen enchantment worked most effectively when the broom had been decorated with the witch it would carry in mind, as though small emblems or trinkets emphasised the casters desire for the recipient of their gift to be carried safely. And even though Agatha’s memories of Rio had been plucked from her mind like an apple from a branch, she knew just from Agnes’s scarlet-shrouded memories alone, how much Rio adored plants. So, it felt fitting to pull the evergreen vine from it’s home and twine it around Rio’s broom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Covertly, She glanced over, curious to see what Rio was choosing for her, as it was an unspoken understanding that the two of them would build a broom for the other, without question. To her surprise, or with retrospect it wasn’t a surprise at all, Rio’s eyes were already settled upon her, and sparkling with that same lingering hunger that always seemed to be present whenever her gaze landed upon Agatha's person. Although her hands were busy still, securing Agatha’s broom with strips of dried root, evidently prioritising safety over aesthetics.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heart gave a needy little whimper at Rio’s expression, at the knowledge this witch, a woman she couldn’t even
     <i>
      remember
     </i>
     , was so clearly devoted to her wellbeing that everything she did was designed to ensure Agatha’s safety; both emotional and physical.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a reverent thing to witness and a heavy weight to bear. Not from a place of ingratitude for once, but rather at feeling, quite spectacularly too, that she was unworthy of such depths of piety.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, another crying shriek jerked her back to reality and with haste she and Rio completed the hexenbesen ritual and swapped brooms, their hands brushing slightly as they did so, causing a stirring of heat to bloom beneath her skin. A heat she was forced to ignore and tamp down on the moment a member of the Salem Seven leapt at Teen from the rocky outcrop above, throwing them both onto the ground with a violent, resounding thump.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thinking quickly, Alice used her broom to swipe the feral witch away from Teen, and within a few panicked minutes they were all soaring up toward the sky, with only the wild shrieks of the Salem Seven, and Rio’s gleeful whooping echoing around them, as the ground shrunk away and the broad expanse of The Road’s night sky welcomed them all with a stunning show of twinkling stars and a huge glowing, luminous moon.
    </p>
    <p>
     The peace that followed felt surreal; almost abstract in comparison to the series of adrenaline-inducing events that had occurred since jolting awake. The gentle hum of laughter and light conversation sailed past Agatha’s ears, carried on the wind as their troupe embraced the serenity of the moment; of an instance of sisterhood that, for the first time since their makeshift group had formed, felt like it possessed a genuine element of covenhood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha inhaled deeply and allowed herself a brief moment to feel her lungs expanding with fresh air, to centre herself, and steer herself away from the fear the Salem Seven always managed to provoke into motion whenever she heard their feral shrieks echoing on the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes, almost as though they were the tide and Rio the moon, were drawn back to stare at the green witch from over her shoulder. She managed to capture Rio in a rare moment of respite, where all of that constant tension the green witch held inside, obviously with the effort it was taking to keep all of her secrets so close to her heart, to worry over Agatha, and to make up excuses to sneak off to do whatever deed demanded her time and attention, had been left on the ground below, leaving her, quite simply, a witch gliding on a broomstick, glowing under the moon’s opulent light, with the breeze teasing at her dark hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was, to use a word that didn’t do the scene justice, although Agatha wasn’t sure one actually existed that could encompass it in any case, beautiful. And for a single blinding moment Agatha felt all of the air her lungs had been holding onto, in that subconscious motion of breathing every human possessed, stutter in her throat, causing her to inhale sharply at just how stunning Rio was whilst sailing high above the straggly tree tops of The ever-winding Road below.
    </p>
    <p>
     A heavy frisson of want started to ache deep inside her body, although this time, it wasn’t sexual. It was an ache to simply
     <i>
      know
     </i>
     her, to know her in a way that would mirror the devotion she could see so clearly in Rio’s eyes anytime her gaze landed upon Agatha’s face. She wanted so desperately to understand it, she wanted to learn everything about her, and she wanted back what had been stolen from her, this woman and their history, in it’s entirety.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it was as she was staring at Rio that her mind made another connection.
    </p>
    <p>
     The mysterious
     <i>
      Her
     </i>
     Rio was searching for, the one she was hoping the end of The Road would help her find.
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <i>
      Her
     </i>
     was Agatha. Of course it was, it all made so much damn sense. So much so, she almost felt embarrassed that she was only now realising this to be the case. Not to mention the potent level of spitting jealousy she had felt at even the
     <i>
      thought
     </i>
     of Rio yearning for anyone but
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Another beat of tenderness pulsed throughout her then, knowing that of all the things in this world Rio could wish for when granted an impossible request, was for Agatha’s mind to be returned to her, and for the memories that had been stolen from her to be released from the scarlet prison they were currently being held in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze, which had gentled with undisguisable yearning, was jolted from it’s current focus when Rio’s broom, along with her own, started to twist upside down, before starting to steer downward too, aiming for the leaf-strewn Road below.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What’s going on?!” Lilia shrieked, clinging desperately to her broom.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s The Road!” Agatha called back, “it’s forcing us down!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re going to crash!” Alice cried; voice filled with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It won’t let us leave!” Agatha managed to yell before her voice was drowned out by all of their screams, a mixture of winding wails as their brooms continued to spin down towards the ground with terrifying speed.
    </p>
    <p>
     All except Rio that is, who was cackling manically, as though she was merely on a day out at a theme park instead of hurtling towards a messy and painful death.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the last moment, just before they made contact with the dirt, their brooms levelled out and they continued flying forward, only this time skimming the leaves covering The Road’s undulating path, causing them to flurry around them like a stormy autumn’s day with the burst of air their flight made as they shot by.
    </p>
    <p>
     A dark figure appeared on the path ahead, a figure shrouded in black, with a gaping maw from which thousands of iridescent cicada's emerged in a single heaving mass of clicking wings and scrabbling legs. Without any option to avoid the impact, Agatha led her makeshift coven directly through the storm of insects, and right through the shrouded witch too, who shrieked with fury at their determined resilience to her pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their flight ended when the ground finally met them, throwing them all together in a writhing heap of arms and legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The screams of the Salem Seven continued to echo all around as Agatha got to hurried feet, only to see the sanctuary of the next trial materialising in front of them. As quickly as possible, they piled through the cabin doorway and when Agatha finally shut it, sealing them inside, a resounding thump on the outside of the door indicated just how close to being caught they had been.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha breathed out an “
     <i>
      oh my god!
     </i>
     ” As everyone drooped with fatigue, taking a few minutes to breathe deeply and recover from the furious flight they had just endured.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took a moment for Agatha to take note of their new location and the style The Road had chosen for them too. She had a moment of recalling Wanda’s hex and how her fake television show would run through the decades, because this entire set, including her new outfit, had been plucked directly from the 1980s. It had evidently been inspired for the 80s penchant for slasher films revolving around groups of friends spending the weekend away in a cabin in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
     A large purple shirt was her main article of clothing; comfortable and baggy, covering shorts that were short enough to be hidden beneath the shirt entirely, making it look like she was basically wearing nothing on her bottom half. Lifting a hand she brushed fingers over her hair, relived to feel it’s length had remained the same, only now pulled up into a messy side ponytail.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest of the coven had been restyled too, including Rio whose long legs were bare in skimpy shorts. Agatha’s eyebrows rose in silent appreciation as she dragged distracted eyes up the full length of them, admiring the subtle indentation of muscle that became clear with every step she took forward, and the way her tanned skin glowed gold under the yellow lamplight.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay,” she eventually said, having caught her breath and valiantly pushed Rio’s long legs and bare skin to the back of her mind, “all right? Okay. We’re okay,” she reassured them all, just as her fingers found a cicada shell in her hair, which she promptly plucked out to throw on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen, of course, was the first to argue back, “no we’re
     <i>
      not!
     </i>
     The entire Halloween aisle’s outside waiting for us!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha drew patience close and ground out a semi-polite response, “and it doesn’t look like they can get in, does it? So, all we have to do is complete the trial and continue on before they can reach us. Okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How?” Alice shot back, arms thrown up in exasperation, “kiss, marry, kill?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean…” Rio drawled, sauntering closer to Agatha to tug on her ponytail, “that get’s my vote”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Absolutely not,” Jen said sternly, immediately putting an end to that particular train of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was joking,” Alice said quickly, counteracting Rio’s agreement, who, now she had been loudly outvoted, simply shrugged and started to saunter around the room, fiddling with random nick-nacks and other things that had been added to the trial scenery, like the background dressing on a film.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone dispersed to hunt for the next clue, each of them still breathing heavily following their hectic escape. Agatha watched them all for a brief moment, eyes jumping from one to the next, until her eyes, quite naturally, were drawn back to Rio, who was currently fiddling with a rubix cube toward the back of the cabin, where the shadows were deep enough to hide the kisses Rio had just joked about. The same kisses, now they had been mentioned, Agatha was determined to claim.
    </p>
    <p>
     Glancing around to ensure the others were still occupied, Agatha sauntered closer to Rio, raising an eyebrow in obvious amusement as Rio struggled to solve the puzzle cube.
    </p>
    <p>
     “All of that power bubbling beneath your skin and you’re foiled by a
     <i>
      child's toy?
     </i>
     ” She couldn’t resist prodding, feeling a spark of that heady, familiar attraction rush through her the moment Rio’s dark eyes shot up to glare at her, genuinely annoyed that she couldn’t beat the cube's colourful riddle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s obviously rigged,” Rio said through a scowl, as her eyes dropped back to study the toy with petulant venom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled, “it obviously
     <i>
      isn’t
     </i>
     . It’s a puzzle solved through logical thinking”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyebrows rose in amusement, “oh, is that so? And am I to assume you, Agatha Harkness, are logical enough to solve it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yep,” Agatha said with pep, whilst rocking from her toes to her heels in overt innocence, “I can show you how to beat it, if it’s annoying you that much”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio held it out for her to take, but Agatha, always the first to grab any opportunity presented to her and twist it with both hands until every single drop of gain could be wrung from it, simply shook her head and refused to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pushed the rubix cube closer, impatiently gesturing for Agatha to take it, “show me,” she said, her tone a command.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ooh, demanding aren't we?” Agatha couldn’t help but drawl lewdly as she sauntered even closer to Rio, “I’ll show you how to win the puzzle game, but you’ll owe me for it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A knowing smirk started to bloom on Rio’s face, “for showing me how to solve a puzzle cube?” Her voice was low, almost disbelieving that Agatha was intending to take a conversation over a toy, where they both knew it was going.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, for solving a puzzle cube,” Agatha parroted mockingly, at last plucking it from Rio’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Playing along with Agatha’s game, Rio’s smirk deepened, “and what debt will I owe for this demonstration?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pretended to ponder it for a short minute, humming quietly as she lazily started to twist the rubix cube around, “hmm, I’ll have to think about my terms, but I should warn you it will be something wicked, and will probably involve you losing all of your clothing”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed in shocked delight, evidently surprised at Agatha’s audacity, which, if they had known each other for as long as Agatha had deduced they must have from yesterday's revelation's, was amusing in it’s own right.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s grin broadened as her hands picked up speed, moving so quickly that she solved the rubix cube in a boast-worthy amount of time. Then, as though it were merely a cheap trinket, she held it out for Rio to double-check each side of the cube consisted of a single wall of colour. “Here you go. I held up my half of the deal, so you’re now contractually obliged to hold up yours whenever I decide to cash in”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took the cube back from her and studied it closely, “I don’t think so. You didn’t even show me how, and you did it really quickly to show off. Seems like a crooked deal to me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gasped in mock outrage, “
     <i>
      crooked?
     </i>
     As if
     <i>
      I
     </i>
     would ever try and trick an innocent witch into doing something deviant”. Sensing another opportunity, she drew closer to Rio and wrapped both arms around her waist from behind, so she could cradle both her hands and the rubix cube with her own, “I can show you like this if that's any better, it will give you an opportunity to really focus on my fingers”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agatha
     </i>
     ,” Rio drawled in warning, immediately picking up on the overtly sexual undertone of Agatha’s words, “what did I say last night?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, Agatha feigned innocence. “I resent the implication that I am doing
     <i>
      anything
     </i>
     but showing you how to beat this puzzle, just like we agreed,” she whispered into Rio’s ear, denying the claim she was actively attempting to seduce the green witch, which was exactly what she was trying to do. “I was just going to say that the rubix cube is a toy of strategy, pattern recognition, and memory”. Rio melted slightly, her body drooping to rest against Agatha’s as that physical wall she was intent on keeping between them started to tremble and shake, just as Agatha intended. “It could even be argued it’s a lot like having sex with someone”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snorted at that, obviously aware of what Agatha’s was trying to do but unable to find the strength to pull away. Smirking at Rio's weakness for her, Agatha doubled down, continuing to whisper words into the green witch's ear whilst guiding her hands to mess up the puzzle she had just solved, so they could solve it again together.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Agatha sighed out slowly, relishing the goosebumps that erupted across the back of Rio’s neck at the feeling of her breath brushing her skin, “you don’t believe me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew if given enough time to respond Rio would say something sarcastic, something that might ruin the sweet tension she had worked hard to build. So, before Rio could say anything, she continued to speak. “A rubix cube takes patience, just like good sex. To win it you have to pay attention to the patterns emerging, the same way you should pay attention to your lovers body. It takes focus, it takes spatial awareness, it takes a certain level of imagination, as you have to think ahead and consider what positions might work most
     <i>
      effectively
     </i>
     ”. As she spoke she guided Rio’s hands through the motions of the puzzle, showing her the rhythm of it, demonstrating the times to keep a section as it was and the times it was best to change it, “a lot of twisting and turning is involved, alongside a need for dexterous fingers, and of course…” she hauled the last two sides into position, completing the cube for a second time in as many minutes, “...satisfaction is oh-so sweet the moment you slide into home plate and claim the win”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could tell Rio was affected by her efforts because her breathing had quickened, yet just as Agatha was moving Rio’s plait from her neck in order to free up enough tanned skin for her lips to start exploring properly, Alice, the bitch, interrupted the moment with a banal question, “whose trial is this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio answered, her voice shaky as she staggered from Agatha’s grip and back towards the others, much to Agatha’s growing frustration, until she heard Rio’s answer at least, “it’s Agatha’s trial”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do you know?” Teen asked, voice lilting up with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A blood moon – when the veil between the living and the dead is at its thinnest,” Rio explained, turning to pin Agatha with dark, hungry eyes, her chest still heaving, “who better to commune with the dead than someone who’s put so many in the grave?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes and walked on sullen feet back towards the others too, annoyed that she hadn’t managed to steal a single kiss, and had managed instead to make herself even more frustrated than she had already been after last night. Which was saying something.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s answer, and her ability to deduce that this was indeed Agatha’s trial, didn’t surprise her. The fact she spoke of Agatha’s long list of victims with something resembling reverence however, or even pride at how many lives she had snuffed out, certainly did.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was becoming the case that for every new thing she learned about Rio, and every time Rio exposed more of herself for Agatha to hungrily recommit to memory, she gained an even deeper understanding of precisely
     <i>
      why
     </i>
     the two of them had been drawn together in the first place, even without her memories to act as proof. It just all made an awful lot of sense, especially with how complimentary and cohesive their unique brands of chaos blended together, complimenting one another like a sunset across a broad, dark lake; it simply worked, no further justification was required.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We have to Ouija,” Teen announced from behind her, having scouted a Ouija board from the pile of 80s boardgames. She turned to find him turning the box upside down so the board and planchette fell onto a squat coffee table, surrounded by an array of colourful beanbags.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of their watches beeped simultaneously, indicating the trial had started. The rest of the witches drew together as Teen read out the rules to all of them, “number one – do not use the Ouija board alone. Number two – do not speak over each other”.
    </p>
    <p>
     He threw a rather pointed look towards Agatha, even though literally all of them started to argue against that particular point, which she did too, obviously, demanding loudly, “
     <i>
      it’s not written there! Show me that!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     He silenced them all by continuing to read aloud over the top of their raised voices, ignoring all of their complaints and questions, “three! Do
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     taunt the spirits”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once again, an accusatory glare was thrown her way from Teen, and much to her disgust, everybody else too.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      What?
     </i>
     ” She said, feigning innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
     He repeated the point to emphasise it, an unnecessary effort in her opinion, before finally finishing the list of rules. All of which, felt more like
     <i>
      suggestions
     </i>
     rather than strict rules with terrible consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, it was clear from the timers starting that this was indeed the correct game to play for this particular trial. So without much fanfare they gathered around the board and started the first round of attempted communication.
    </p>
    <p>
     A devilish voice on her shoulder whispered a particularly hilarious idea in her ear, one that quickly took shape as she started to push the planchette to spell out a name they would all recognise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen spelled it out for them aloud, “
     <b>
      M.R.S/H.A.R.T
     </b>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Mrs Hart
     </i>
     ,” Jen gasped fearfully, before continuing to address her dead neighbour with a voice threaded with nerves, “hey girl, feeling better?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How’s your face?” Alice asked lightly, evidently going for a gently banterous approach to communicating with the recently deceased.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No taunting!” Lilia scolded, which was the perfect opportunity for Agatha to rip the board from beneath her distracted fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Your hands!
     </i>
     What did you
     <i>
      do?!
     </i>
     ” Agatha cried, slipping into character as easily as an otter slid into a stream.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia looked horrified, “I didn’t do it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t hear her however, all she heard was the resounding
     <b>
      ACTION
     </b>
     from the clapperboard in her head, before she started to writhe and shake as though an angry spirit had indeed possessed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Oh, my,
     </i>
     ” she drawled, adopting a strong New England accent and inflecting her words just like Mrs Hart would have done, “
     <i>
      what a journey!
     </i>
     There I was, living my tiny life in the burbs, baking
     <i>
      casseroles
     </i>
     , linking into conspiracy theories on
     <i>
      Facebook
     </i>
     , drinking before
     <i>
      noon
     </i>
     , and there you were bringing
     <i>
      chills
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      thrills
     </i>
     and bringing on my own early
     <i>
      demise!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Listen Mrs Hart...” Lilia said, attempting to appease the angry spirit she thought they had disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s not Mrs Hart,” Jen corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s Sharon Davis,” Alice supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I
     <i>
      am
     </i>
     ,” Agatha insisted, blank smile on her face, “I’m Sharon Davis”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s voice was annoyed when she popped her façade, “she’s Agatha”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      What?
     </i>
     ” Agatha giggled, continuing on with her impression, primarily because she found it funny.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s scared,” Rio told the others, pointing out a truth Agatha would have much preferred stayed a secret, before looking up at her with dark eyes and a challenging smirk, “come on sweetheart, you’re not afraid of something as lame as ghosts are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Now forced to claw around for her dignity, she stretched her neck slightly, “okay, I thought that was pretty good”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The clock is ticking,” Rio said, slapping her palm against the cushion beside her with an emphatic motion, “it was a good impression though, I’ll give you that”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Feeling rushed to do something she
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     didn’t want to do, Agatha flapped her hands and begrudgingly dropped down to join their circle, “fine. Well let’s get to it. Right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her question preceded a nervous glance at each of their faces, as the reality of the specific door she was opening became even more paramount. It was the not-knowing that made the entire affair far worse to face, because she didn’t know which ghost from her past, of which there were
     <i>
      plenty
     </i>
     , was currently waiting on the other side, eager to torment her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Faces ran through her minds eye, flickering from Evanora’s hateful sneer to Nicky’s sweet smile. She would prefer her mother if truth be told, as horrifying as that reunion would be, because the thought of her son being used in such a heinous way was beyond comprehension, not to mention revealing a past that she didn’t want to share with any of them. Except perhaps the green witch beside her, who might well have a claim all of her own to Agatha’s child. But that was a thought for another time, as she placed trembling fingers onto the planchette and started to repeat the same infernal chant again, her voice far more serious this time round.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first word the planchette spelled out sent a rush of fear through all of them, all of them except Rio who craned her neck back with glee as they sounded out the word together in monotonous chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <b>
      D.E.A.T.H. Death
     </b>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next word sent yet another wave of alarm through Agatha's body, sharpening the fear she could already feel buzzing just beneath her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <b>
      P.U.N.I.S.H. Punish
     </b>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the answer that followed the next question of “punish who?” Grabbed those first few initial alarm bells and tripled them, as though the bell tower of a grand cathedral had blossomed beneath her ribs and was trying to alert her to Sunday service.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <b>
      A.G.A.T-
     </b>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew where this was going, and she now knew precisely who was waiting for her. For there was only one soul on the other side who would use the word
     <b>
      PUNISH
     </b>
     in that particular manner. For it was a word Agatha had become intimately familiar with throughout her miserable childhood and even worse teenager years. A word that had been weaponised against her for every single transgression she had ever committed, however light or accidental they might have been at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a twisted woman’s twisted weapon, utilising the act of parenting to instil terror in a child for the mere crime of existing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Stop! All right, stop!
     </i>
     ” She bellowed pulling herself up to stand on wobbly legs, not willing nor ready to face this trauma, the trauma The Road had no right to pick out from her psyche in order to design it’s sick games.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had endured too many people prodding and poking through her thoughts and memories over this last year, taking things that should be sacred, stealing moments that should be safe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet the rest of the coven, aside from Rio who had also shot to her feet and was trying to coral Agatha toward another room in order to calm her down, just continued to spell out the word the planchette was spelling again, and again, and again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <b>
      A.G.A.T.H.A/A.G.A.T.H.A/A.G.A.T.H.A…
     </b>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Stop!
     </i>
     ” She heard a voice rasp desperately, not at all aware it was her own with the level of panic that had overtaken her actions and words, scrabbling away from them all, “
     <i>
      stop it! Stop making it do that!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, that same fear dragged her forward to grab the board and throw it, putting a stop to that horrific chant of her name that was haunting her just as well as any ghost might.
    </p>
    <p>
     whatever entity had been trying to communicate with them roared in fury, making a rapturous noise erupt all around them, as a swirl of wind so powerful it dragged books from shelves and pillows from chairs swept around the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of them were screaming at one another, each of them afraid and unsure of what to do until Jen pointed out the answer with a disturbing level of relish, “they already told us!
     <i>
      Punish Agatha!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     The noise stopped, yet Agatha’s fear only seemed to grow as the witches she had not yet considered a threat started to circle around her, pointing out her flaws, her mistakes, and insisting to one another that to punish her was the only way to win this particular trial.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, like a light from the darkness, Rio swept through the circle they had formed around her, and with her knife held aloft and pointed directly at Jen, so close that the shining blade brushed the skin of her chin, she placed herself between Agatha and the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     The cabin seemed to darken as she did so. It almost appeared to pulse with a power not entirely of this world. And it was clear too, that whatever entity had been taunting them from beyond the grave wasn’t responsible for this sharp change in the atmosphere either, for the room suddenly became minutely warmer, as though the ghoul had been pushed away with the mere force of Rio’s anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen, Alice, and Lilia all took a nervous step backwards, as Rio said two simple words in opposition to their stance, “
     <i>
      Try. Me
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t know what happened beyond that moment though, because in the next instant that same freezing cold she had only moments ago felt recede, suddenly returned and coalesced around her entire body. Everything suddenly went black, and then when her vision returned, it was as though she could only witness the scene through a hole as large as a pinprick. It felt like she had been shunted to the back of her own body, whilst something large, dark, and evil slithered between her skin and bones to take control of her autonomy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moments passed in flashes from that point onwards, and it became even harder to orient herself the minute all of the lights went out in the cabin, pitching them all into darkness, because, quite suddenly, she found herself looking at her coven from an entirely different angle, one that a bird may have shared if the roof didn’t block it’s view.
    </p>
    <p>
     The panicked voices from below echoed through her mind slowly, as though they were travelling through treacle, only to be blocked out by a voice she hadn’t heard in centuries, a voice she had purposefully tried to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I always knew you were a demon born of human flesh, you beastly child. Look at the monster you have become, Killer-of-Witches”.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Agatha had been in control of her body she would have shuddered in fear, yet her mother had taken over complete control of her faculties, so all she could do was whimper silently and feel every ounce of terror the child in her had felt when faced with that same hateful voice, the one that had preceded every beating, and inspired every instant of fear she had experienced before she had finally severed that painful, rotting, familial tie.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where’d she go?” Lilia’s voice echoed around her, almost in slow motion.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agatha
     </i>
     ,” Jen drawled, “let’s talk about this for a minute. We’re sisters in the craft, remember?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of rattling breathing overpowered all other noise then, growing louder and louder until she realised her own lungs were the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does anyone else hear that?” Alice asked quietly, voice fearful.
    </p>
    <p>
     A light blinded her vision next, as Teen pointed his torch upward jolting her into action to try and push her mother’s spirit out of her body. They dropped to the ground, and as their energies fought for internal control, her body continued to contort and bend horribly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen scrabbled away and her mother zoned in on his face, pushing Agatha’s spine into a crab-like arch with which to pursue him with, as Rio’s voice finally became the loudest in the room, asking in a concerned drawl, “sweetheart, you okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Even Rio’s voice wasn’t enough to drag her back into control of herself though, and within a blinding flash her mother had Jen against the wall with Agatha’s hands around her throat, squeezing the life out of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     the moment the cabin lights came back on, it was over as quickly as it had started; her body was her own again. Her head was pounding, feeling very much like her brain had been stretched to accommodate an intruder. Her body hurt too, feeling achy and sore from the ways in which it had contorted into positions she had never before attempted, or thought physically possible if truth be told.
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened her eyes slowly, flinching at the brightness of the lights, and realised she had been flung, quite violently, onto the balcony overseeing the main section of the cabin. The others were all in a panic below, unsure where she had ended up, or if she was still possessed with the spirit of a ghost that had tried to choke Jen to death.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha contemplated staying put, her sense of self preservation still on red alert from earlier on when every single one of her so-called coven, except Rio, had considered punishing her without pause for concern or empathy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet it was Rio’s voice, sounding panicked and stricken with concern, “Agatha! Where is she? All right,
     <i>
      where is she?
     </i>
     ” That prompted her to try and get on shaky knees and attempt to stand. And it was Rio’s voice too, that alerted her to the fact her mother’s spirit must now be physically manifesting, for her answer to Teen’s fearful questions was an emphatic, “
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     is a ghost. I
     <i>
      hate
     </i>
     ghosts”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who are you?!” Lilia demanded, voice pitching up fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hateful mother’s voice echoed out in response, her haughty tone the exact same as it had been in Salem, nearly four hundred years ago, “Evanora Harkness of the Salemites”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Figuring there wasn't going to be a better opportunity to enter the conversation, Agatha grabbed the balcony’s ledge and hauled herself up, pushing wayward hair from her clammy face as she did so with a shaky hand, “hey mom, it was nice having you in my body for a second there. I’ve never felt so close to you before”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Evanora ignored Agatha, choosing to address the other’s as though Agatha hadn’t even spoken, “my coven risked
     <i>
      everything
     </i>
     to kill her. And you fools have willingly
     <i>
      joined
     </i>
     her”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop embarrassing me in front of my friends, Mom,” She couldn’t resist drawling, still struggling to keep herself upright on abused muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wasn't sure if Jen's next question was about her mother or herself, “so what do we do? Do we banish her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia’s answered Jen’s question, “emotion ties them to this plane. They have unfinished business”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So lets finish her business,” Teen said quietly, before raising his voice to shout at Evanora, “what do you want?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You must finish the Witches Road
     <i>
      without
     </i>
     Agatha,” her mother answered, her voice a detestable command.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She means
     <i>
      punish
     </i>
     Agatha,” Lilia deduced quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mother was quick to confirm Lilia’s deductions, “leave her,
     <i>
      with me!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s voice sliced through the conversation like a sharpened blade through flesh, “no!
     <i>
      No way!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha crept closer the moment Evanora’s odious stare fell upon Rio, lip curled back almost disdainfully as she swept her gaze from Rio’s feet to her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mom?” Agatha drew her mother’s ire back onto herself, “why do you hate me still?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice was nervous, and it felt, humiliatingly so, as though she was sixteen-year-old Agatha again, anxiously asking her mother the question she had never received an answer to, and no longer the grown woman who had lived entire lifetimes since her mother had tried to kill her, and died for the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a question any child would want to know the answer to; what was so wrong with them that even their parent, the one person whose love should be unconditional, couldn’t find it within themselves to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it hurt, far more than she would have ever predicted, that even
     <i>
      now
     </i>
     , three hundred and fifty years since ending her mother’s life in an act of self-defence, that Evanora couldn’t find an ounce of affection or empathy for her child. The child she had despised for merely existing, for having a gift that she didn’t understand, and a hunger for knowledge, that if nurtured, could have brought wonderful blessings to her covens doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
     And with her glare as disgusted as it always had been when staring down at her daughter, Evanora answered Agatha’s question without hesitation or pause, “you were born evil. I ought to have killed you the moment you left my body”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We have to go,” Jen’s voice cut through Agatha’s heartbreak. A word she despised, for it meant her mother still had the power to do so in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet even Jen’s determined, spiteful voice was drowned out in that moment by every single piece of wood holding the balcony in place cracking in two, by every pillow and beanbag bursting and spilling their feathers and innards out onto the floor in rattling waterfalls, and every light bulb in the cabin flickering violently as Rio drew both her hands up in front of herself, and in a voice preceded by a bassy echo took control of the entire scene with unquestionable ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Shut your mouths, all of you!
     </i>
     ” A pulse of emerald power shot outward from Rio’s body, stunning them all, including Evanora, into silence. Agatha’s jaw dropped as she watched in shocked awe as Rio stepped toward Evanora with deadly intent, “who summoned you here, wraith?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s voice sounded ethereal and regal, as though she was stepping out from behind the mask she had been hiding behind, and was finally exposing the true depths of herself at long last. Her mother’s ghost flinched back as Rio stormed closer, though she didn’t fade or disappear, stubborn bitch that she was. If anything, it appeared as though Evanora’s sneer became deeper as she stared at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know
     <i>
      you
     </i>
     ,” her mother hissed, “I know who you are to my daughter, the sin you shared together. I know how your darkness defiled her body, how your unnatural evil grew inside of her”.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Agatha had thought Rio looked dangerous before, she had underestimated Rio’s power, for in the next flash of the cabin light’s Rio’s face changed momentarily, appearing ghoulish, almost skeletal in appearance before it was once again flesh and blood. Yet with a single swipe of Rio’s hand, she pushed Evanora’s spirit backwards with a thunderous gale of air, one her mother’s phantom body couldn’t fight as she was pinned against the cabin wall, and a satisfying spark of fear flashed across her ghostly features.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You
     <i>
      dare
     </i>
     speak to me in such a manner,
     <i>
      witch?
     </i>
     Do you have
     <i>
      any
     </i>
     idea of the things I can do to your soul? Of the
     <i>
      places
     </i>
     I can send you for all eternity?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mother gasped and her eyes widened with fright as they focussed on Rio’s face, “oh,” she suddenly cried, “oh mercy, I didn’t- I didn’t know who-
     <i>
      what
     </i>
     - you are!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could no longer see Rio’s face, for she had turned her back and was facing Evanora who was still pinned to the wall, yet whatever was written across Rio’s expression must be startling, if not entirely terrifying, for although her mother was already a ghoul and the same colour as a cloud, she paled further still.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s voice was a harsh growl as she continued to berate Evanora, “you plead for mercy, something you never found within yourself to give to your very own
     <i>
      child
     </i>
     . You will pay for your sins Evanora Harkness, now that I have finally found you, after years of searching for your wayward soul. Here you are, delivered to me, trapped like an insect beneath a pin”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Evanora’s spirit seemed to expand at that, her panic causing her to flash in and out of existence, until with a wild pop her physical form devolved into a single orb of light, one that immediately started to shoot around the room, hunting for an exit out of the trial they were all trapped in together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Realising there was no escape to be had, the orb aimed for Agatha instead, evidently intent on taking control of her body once more in order to force herself off The Road, or maybe to use her body as some form of shield against Rio's anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone started to scream and squeal in reaction to Evanora's flight. Lilia jumped onto the sofa as though her mother's sailing soul was a scuttling cockroach, whilst Jen and Alice both started to leap for it the moment it flew past, trying to catch it with their bare hands, although it was a phantom and simply flew right through their flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, as if the scene wasn’t chaotic enough, a loud, resounding bang started to echo on the front door, as though whoever was on the other side was using something hard and heavy to try and ram the door down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who had managed to duck and dive every attempt her mother had made to smack her in the face and as a result re-possess her, watched then as Rio drew the blade from her belt and sliced it through the air, right as Evanora was sweeping past, causing her soul to freeze in place and crash to the floor, where it lay sputtering; a sad, flickering orb on old, dusty floorboards.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s teeth were bared like a creature from a fairy tale, and her voice was an undisputable order as she threw an arm out towards the Ouija board in the corner, on which the planchette had started to spin wildly in an attempt to communicate something else to them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What does it say?!” Rio demanded, as she crouched to secure Agatha’s mothers soul with her knife to the floorboards below, pinning the spirit in place even as it wriggled and writhed against it's restraints.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen, who had skidded on his knees to read whatever message was being imparted, spelled out a name Agatha had never uttered to anyone in this room, not within current memory at least.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <b>
      N.I.C.H.O.L.A.S/S.C.R.A.T.C.H. Nicholas Scratch!
     </b>
     ” He yelled the answer out just as the Ouija board went still and a staircase descended from the wall, as though it had been buried within the structure of the cabin this entire time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha jerked towards Teen and the Ouija board, feeling the blood drain from her face in both shock at hearing Nicky’s name spoken so bluntly; without the reverence he deserves, but also at the thought her son's soul was
     <i>
      here
     </i>
     . That Nicky was in this very room, that he was waiting to speak to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t get a minute to even try and communicate with him though, for the front door started to splinter under the strain it was enduring and her mother’s spirit started to flicker, as though she was close to pulling herself free from beneath Rio’s knife.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who had taken several concerned steps toward Agatha the moment her son’s name had been exclaimed aloud, suddenly jolted to a halt and spun around with anxious eyes to consider the failing door. Then, as though she were their undisputed leader, she started barking orders at all of them, “you need to go! All of you, you need to carry on down The Road and I’ll catch up soon!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen scrabbled to his feet and was quick to take heed of Rio’s demanding tone, corralling Jen, Lilia, and Alice through the hatch. He threw one final nod toward Rio, like a soldier on the battlefield acknowledging their general, before he too fled the room, following after the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt frozen in place, stuck in a room that her mother had tormented her in, stuck in the same room she had heard her son’s voice in too. Unable to move on from either moment, she felt herself fracture internally at the mixing, queasy mess her emotions were creating in her stomach, like some hideous boiling broth that consisted of her most ardent hopes and her most hateful memories.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agatha!
     </i>
     ” Rio said, voice urgent now the door was creaking under the strain, and splinters of wood were flying towards them, through which feral hisses could be heard, “you need to go! Follow the others. I’ll catch up!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s final words jolted her back to reality and she found herself frowning in confusion, “what do you mean
     <i>
      catch up?!
     </i>
     Are you insane?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabbed Rio’s wrist and tried to drag her towards the door, but Rio held firm and gently pulled her fingers from her body, “go! Please, I’ll deal with this lot. I need to do something, something important”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the fuck is so important you can’t run for your life?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     And much to Agatha’s anger, Rio chuckled as though Agatha had said something foolish, before her expression suddenly softened into something warm yet urgent, “please, just listen to me. Go on ahead. I’ll be right behind you, I just have a job to do first”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet Rio underestimated Agatha's stubbornness, for she quickly crossed her arms and arched an eyebrow, “I’ll help you with whatever little job you have to do. Now come on, let’s get to it before we’re both murdered in cold blood!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face flashed with panic at Agatha's refusal to leave her. Moments later, her expression shifted, turning into a regretful cringe for what she was about to do, “forgive me for this sweetheart,” she said softly before Agatha could determine what she meant, which was to snap her fingers and cast Agatha from the trial; up the staircase, through the door, and drop her by the others, who were all panting and back in their own clothes, in a cloud of emerald smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was, much like Rio had done outside Lilia’s shop, dropped right on her ass, from which she immediately hauled herself up with a furious roar, before storming back the way they had come from, right past the others, determined to reach the last trial and drag Rio out of there by her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet the Road just kept stretching onwards in an ominous undulating wave and the cabin, the cabin that Rio was in, was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      RIO
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Agatha was expelled from the room, and even though Rio had spun to face however many of the Salem Seven were forcing their way into the trial, the door gave a final judder and was suddenly still, as though they too had been forced back onto the primary stretch of Road by Rio’s magic.
    </p>
    <p>
     A dark fear started to bleed throughout her mind then at the thought of sending Agatha to a place the Salem Seven could reach easily, not to mention the fact their feral hunting senses were so in tune with Agatha’s scent, that the moment she was gone they knew their quarry was no longer hiding within the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Desperate to speed along the process and not feeling particularly charitable towards her wife’s despicable mother, she pulled her knife’s point from the floorboard, keeping Evanora’s soul pierced through it and dangling on the tip, before flinging it violently at the wall, until the physical manifestation of Evanora was once again pinned to the wall, her face drawn and eyes wide with fear at the too late realisation of precisely
     <i>
      who
     </i>
     she was facing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dark mistress,” Evanora started to simper through a quivering lip. Rio was certain if ghosts could cry she would be sobbing for clemency, “have
     <i>
      mercy
     </i>
     , oh ancient one. Have mercy on an old woman’s soul”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t have the patience nor the desire to make this situation easier for her, “you beg for something you never gifted. No, witch, you have earned a fate worse than what lays beyond the veil. Although I do not currently possess the time to decide precisely what it is I want to do with you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Within a flash, Rio summoned her Robe; she allowed her flesh to dissolve, and her true face to gleam below the cabin’s dim lights. Evanora shuddered with horror at her appearance as she tried to wriggle free, which was futile for Rio’s power was absolute.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, for now I shall store you where I can keep a close eye on you, and when I have the time to decide what punishment befits your crimes, I shall revisit your fate Evanora Harkness of the Salemites”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, without further delay Rio drew an old jar from the never-ending depths of her Robe’s pocket. It was an antique-looking thing, with cloudy glass and algae growing across the threadbare swath of black cloth that sealed it's top.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swept a hand over the jar, the black cloth disappeared, and with a single sharp inhale Rio drew Evanora’s shrieking, clawing, begging spirit into her mouth where she chewed her down to size, before spitting it into the jar for safekeeping. Then, with another brief glide of her hand, the lid was back in place, sealed until Rio decided otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Within moments she stored Evanora’s soul back within Death’s Robe, and dissolved the evidence of her true self, reclaiming her human face and the outfit The Road had dressed her in for this trial.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, on hurried feet, she fled up the staircase, and started to sprint the moment the cabin dissolved around her to reveal the familiar Road, with its twisting path and scraggly trees upon its border, like row's of ancient soldiers, ordered to guard it for all eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, even after running for ten, even fifteen minutes, she couldn’t find the others. There was no sign of any of them, no sign of anything at all, until she came across a scene that caused her blood to chill in her veins, and her black heart to freeze to a block of ice beneath her ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Agatha’s locket, her most treasured possession, laying face down in the dirt beside a bubbling pool of thick mud, mud that looked as though it were moving, writhing with someone’s desperate attempts to haul themselves free, even as the mud continued to drag them down, down, down deeper into The Road’s greedy underbelly.

     <b>
      RIO
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The mud, in which Rio was elbow deep and clinging with desperate fingers to slippery clothing, smelt, most absurdly of all, of nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn’t hold the aroma of earth or loamy mildew as most mud did, it didn't have scraps of leaf litter breaking down within it’s gloopy mass, and it didn’t, on closer inspection, have any earthly energy either; not the kind Rio could sense with a mere brush of her fingers at least.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, as she hauled the body she had found in the depths of this clinging puddle of sludge upwards and out, these observations merely flickered through her subconscious like sparrows, for her conscious mind was far too focussed on finding her witch and dragging her to safety to take any real notice of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     At first she felt triumph start to quicken beneath her ribs at finding a body still within grasping distance. Yet, when the head of said body finally breached the surface, with a loud, rattling gasp for air, disappointment swiftly drowned out any sense of victory that had started to develop within her heart. For the head she had freed was young, male, and had short curly hair the colour of a starless night.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a growl she roughly hauled him to the edge so he could drag himself the rest of the way, and within seconds was immediately back on her stomach, with both arms buried up to her armpits in mud searching desperately for another brushing glance of warm flesh or drifting hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers felt naught but slippery mud though, so with another wild roar she slipped even further forward until her head and torso were also wading through the thick gloop, now with even more fervid desperation. Absently she noted fingers gripping the waistband of her trousers; Teen had evidently crawled to freedom and was anchoring her search.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then finally,
     <i>
      there
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     A drag of hair against her wrist. Both her hands shot in the direction she had felt the tickling caress and soon found purchase on long hair, then shoulders, and finally underarms which she hooked both her hands under and with all of her strength, which was bolstered by her magic, dragged Agatha to the surface. Teen’s anxious face appeared stark in the blue light from The Road's glowing moon, as he quickly grabbed Agatha from Rio to drag her the rest of the way out of the mud, and onto the leaf-strewn ground beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Is she breathing?!
     </i>
     ” Rio’s voice was a desperate, fearful growl as she clambered back from the edge to start unbuttoning Agatha’s coat and the top two buttons of her shirt, intent on freeing her chest to check her lungs were still moving.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt her stomach drop through itself, far too aware that being who she was prevented her from doing anything to stop nature from following its own rules, and it’s rules were simple; if something stops breathing, then that something stops living.
    </p>
    <p>
     She placed a shaky hand on Agatha's chest and closed her eyes, trying to feel Agatha's lifeforce and that thread every human who had ever lived possessed that linked them to Rio. almost immediately, a pulse of fear echoed in her mind like a rumble of thunder at just how thin Agatha's thread felt when Rio pulled on it; she didn't have long left.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could feel tears dribbling down her cheeks in a wild torrent as she stared up at Teen, “
     <i>
      do something! Save her!
     </i>
     ” She demanded of the pale teenager, a person who
     <i>
      could
     </i>
     interfere and save a life that was seconds away from blinking out, unlike Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice jolted him to action and he dropped to his knees beside her, as the mud from all three of their bodies started to pool into a slick brown puddle onto the leaves beneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was a boy scout and we did like loads of first aid stuff,” he was babbling anxiously even as he started to administer compressions onto Agatha’s chest, before tilting her head up slightly to exhale air into her lungs. He did this three more times with no change. Until, through her tears, Rio watched a new, fierce determination fall across Teen’s brow as he hovered both his hands above Agatha's chest, closed his eyes and started to whisper words Rio couldn’t hear through the pounding fear rushing through her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     When his eyes shot open again, they were glowing blue, radiating light the same way Agatha’s shone purple whenever she was in the midst of conjuring a powerful spell. Rio frowned, not expecting Teen to be so capable at handing, nor possess at all for that matter, such a potent class of raw magic. Magic whose signature felt almost
     <i>
      familiar
     </i>
     , as though his magic was a song built from the notes of another melody, one she had already heard before.
    </p>
    <p>
     His hands, still hovering above Agatha’s chest, moved upward toward her throat which at last jolted movement from her still body. In a sudden flurry of motion, Agatha’s eyes shot open as she slouched sideways, coughing violently to expel a large clod of mud from between her lips, one that had evidently been blocking her airway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her rasping breaths were ragged but not dangerously so, as she held herself up on shaky forearms and took a moment to pant her fatigue away. Rio scrabbled forward on her hands and knees to cradle Agatha’s face and hold it up to study, needing to see her pupils dilate in the moonlight, to feel the proof she was breathing upon her face, to see the perspiration on her forehead, and all the other beautifully empirical evidence that life still thrived within her wife’s body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you alright?” Rio asked, voice a shaky whisper. Her heart didn’t start to settle until she saw the corner of Agatha's lips quirk up into a tired smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “All the better for seeing you, hot stuff,” she croaked, further proving her wellbeing with an ill-timed joke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s responding smile was lost somewhere between relief and fear, a wobbly expression that she was certain made her look even more tragic than the tear tracks still shining on her muddy face.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a shaky hand she held out Agatha’s broach to her, who took it from her with a relieved exhale and a long slow blink, emphasising just how worried she had been it was still at the bottom of the muddy puddle she had been floundering in. Genuine gratitude blossomed in Rio’s black heart for Teen then, as he slumped backwards onto his ass in the dirt, worn out from the energy he had expelled to save Agatha’s life. Rio met his eye and nodded at him once, a serious, solemn gesture for she was intent on showing him just how sincere her thanks were. He acknowledged her gesture with an unsure, tired smile and a short nod of his own, still entirely unaware he had just earned the respect and eternal gratitude of an immortal deity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio fussed over Agatha for a few moments longer, wiping the thick sludgy mud from her face and helping her sit up properly. Then finally, once she had comfortably reassured herself that Agatha was alive, that she was breathing, that she wasn’t going to die before Rio had found a way to free her memories and reaffirm herself as the love of Agatha's life (as much as Agatha herself would deny such a claim), she threw a curious, demanding glance between the pair of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the fuck happened?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah,” Agatha sighed as she clambered to her feet, and with a grimace, started to haul her mud-caked coat from her body, it having been made from a material that had become heavy and cumbersome with sludge. “Yes, well…” she turned to drop her filthy coat beside her, before using both hands to slick her hair back away from her face, “it was a joint effort”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned, feeling a spike of confused frustration start to burn in her gut at Agatha’s evasiveness, “what the hell does that mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It means...” Agatha drawled, stepping closer to Rio so she could start swiping some of the excess mud from Rio’s face and shoulders too, “that one of those Salem bitches came out of nowhere and jumped him”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head toward Teen, who had since started searching through the other mud puddles for the rest of their missing coven.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s frown deepened, “that doesn’t explain how you both ended up in the fucking mud though does it, Agatha?” Rio could hear the frustration and impatience in the tightness of her own voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced over her shoulder to ensure Teen was out of hearing range before lowering her voice even further, “turns out our young friend over there has power beyond his own knowledge,” Agatha’s eyes widened in that curious, hungry way they always did whenever she discovered a new potent power source. “
     <i>
      chaos magic
     </i>
     ,” she breathed out reverently, voice awed and ravenous. “He has no idea how to control it, probably didn’t even know it was there bubbling beneath his palms. What went down was this: Salemite number one jumps on his back, he starts falling all over the place trying to get her off and stop her from clawing his eyeballs out, when, in a moment of panic, he sends out a big’ ol billow of magic that throws all of us, including himself from the mere fucking force of this thing, off The Road, right into the gloopy mess you found us in”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes widened as she recalled the blue power that had crackled over his palms and in his eyes as he saved Agatha’s life, “he saved you with it too, he cleared your airway. Kid's a quick study”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Huh
     </i>
     ,” Agatha considered this new information carefully, throwing another almost-maternal look of affection over her shoulder towards the teenager still scrabbling on his hands and knees for their coven-mates, “clever boy, just like his mother". She turned back toward Rio then and winked in that familiarly frustrating way. It was an expression that implied she had figured
     <i>
      something
     </i>
     out, something that she was going to use and keep to serve herself for as long as she so desired.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning, Agatha sauntered over to Teen, tapped him on the shoulder and said something Rio couldn't hear. Whatever it was upset him though, because he was quickly back on his feet to tower over her with that familiar look of righteous indignation on his muddy face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “His mother?” Rio repeated to herself quietly, frowning for a short moment before, as though the single rock holding back a landslide of understanding had just given way, her comprehension of precisely
     <i>
      what
     </i>
     Agatha meant, snapped into place within her mind, like a riddle answered through implication alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     His mother.
    </p>
    <p>
     His
     <i>
      mother
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
     His
     <i>
      mother
     </i>
     who wields chaos magic with the ease of an archer dispensing arrows.
    </p>
    <p>
     His
     <i>
      mother
     </i>
     whose arcane signature was that very melody Rio had found so familiar, just rearranged to serve her son instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind span through the realisations, turning back to that horrific day when Wanda had stolen Agatha’s memories of Rio from her mind, and left her trapped behind the façade of Agnes. Of how her hex had disintegrated, how Wanda's screams of anguish could be heard from down the street as her dead husband returned to the grave and her children, children who were born from scratch, much like Rio’s only child, had disintegrated and returned to the swirling mass of the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or so Rio had
     <i>
      thought.
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her head shot up as she studied him. Agatha’s back was turned to her as she and Teen continued to speak, so Rio forced her human façade to fall away, allowing, for a brief moment, her true face to show and her innate power to shine through. As quickly as possible she scanned his body with eternal eyes, studying the blood that thrummed beneath his veins, taking note of the DNA threaded throughout his flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Kaplan
     </i>
     . That
     <i>
      is
     </i>
     his family line.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, here were traces of Wanda’s child
     <i>
      too
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     She reclaimed her human face and clothing, although not before hauling her Book from her robe, her Book that had every name of the dead or dying scribbled within it’s mildew-stained pages. Flickering through it, she searched for the name Kaplan and paused the moment she spotted a discrepancy.
    </p>
    <p>
     One she probably should have noticed before now, but one that had been overshadowed by Rio’s personal tragedy of being erased in her entirety from her wife’s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     For there, in black ink was the start of an entry, an entry that was incomplete with the horizontal line of the L in KAPLAN dragging off the page; as though the universe’s pen had been pulled forcefully from the parchment before the word could be finished.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, there it was, in black and white. And alongside it, Rio’s understanding of the situation, followed by the heart-shattering realisation of what it actually
     <i>
      meant
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Because this discrepancy
     <i>
      shouldn’t
     </i>
     exist, and it was Rio’s universe-bound duty to
     <i>
      fix it
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     And in order to
     <i>
      fix it
     </i>
     , she will have to
     <i>
      take him
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Laughter broke her out of her silent stupor, drawing her eye back towards Agatha who was gripping both of Teen’s shoulders and staring up into his face with glowing maternal pride. On his face was a spark of bashfulness and a light flush at having his powers celebrated in the way Rio knew Agatha would be celebrating them. Providing this lost, lonely, magical child with all of the reassurance the vicious witch stored away in Rio's robe had never given her wife when she was his age.
    </p>
    <p>
     Up to this point in her existence, Rio had never experienced a panic attack before.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, the closest she had come to one before was the moment Agatha had disappeared from beyond her senses, shrouded by the Darkhold and out of Rio’s reach for good.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now, facing the realisation that she was going to
     <i>
      have to do it all over again
     </i>
     , that she was going to have to take
     <i>
      another
     </i>
     child from her wife, well, it just about made her lungs collapse and her heart implode at the maddening injustice of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what was worse, Agatha didn’t even
     <i>
      know
     </i>
     that this wasn't the first time Rio had been forced to do such a thing to her. Nor the very reason why she had to in the first place, considering Rio’s true identity was something she hadn’t yet disclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps this was her punishment for falling in love with a mortal witch. Perhaps this was simply the pattern she has been cursed to repeat until Rio finally understood that love, or at least the human definition of the thing, wasn’t something she had any right to feel or experience. That perhaps her feelings, these ever-growing, vibrant sensations that bloomed between her ribs like vines of ivy whenever she felt Agatha’s warmth beside her, or felt the radiance of her smile upon her face like the sun's warm beam on a cold day, were merely an anomaly of the universe, something that should never have been possible; Death’s very own mutation of matter and purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps this was indeed Rio’s fate, the ultimate cosmic joke; that she was to be poisoned and ruined by the one thing all the poet’s of the world agree had the power to transcend even her dark veil; love.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio!” Agatha snapped impatient fingers in front of her face. She quickly jarred back to reality to find she had been bracketed on either side by Agatha and Teen, both of whom had been trying to get her attention for the past minute or so, “finally,” Agatha quipped, “were you sleeping with your eyes open just now? That's like super creepy if you were. Even for you".
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio simply stared at her with wide, panicked eyes, fixating on her smiling face, an image she would never get to see again after she did what she had to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha however, who was entirely unphased by Rio’s strange mood, simply pointed at Teen as though she was a magician and Teen her glamourous assistant, “show her, Teen”.
    </p>
    <p>
     He grinned, looking proud as punch as he said, “my name is Billy Kaplan”.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Ah there it is
     </i>
     , Rio thought to herself, feeling her stomach plummet at the confirmation of her theory; for the seal that had concealed him from all witch-folk was no longer required now Agatha had figured out his identity, confirming he was indeed Billy Maximoff in William Kaplan's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted at Rio’s lack of reaction, “tough crowd”.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was clear she had just assumed it was another one of Rio’s quirks though, for she quickly spun in place and started to saunter down The Road as though she wasn’t still covered in mud, hands in her pocket and chin tilted up arrogantly, “come on, lets go find the next trial”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen started to walk after her but halted the moment his eyes fell on the bubbling puddle of mud beside them, “what about the others though? Shouldn’t we keep looking for them”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha spun and whilst still walking backwards, shrugged flippantly, “even witches can’t hold their breath for that long, kid. If they’re in there, they’re goners”. She then gestured for him to follow her, as though she hadn’t just implied half of their coven had just met a grisly end, and turned to continue walking down The Road’s long winding path, “come on, last one to the next trial is a loser”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio started to follow after her, deciding it was wiser to bide her time, aware that taking Billy will have to be a strategic moment, one that limits the pain of the action for all involved. Including herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had to
     <i>
      think
     </i>
     it through, and she had to be tactical about how she should reveal this reality to the both of them. She would need Billy to come willingly after all, for the risk of his wayward soul taking flight the moment he realised she was onto him was too great.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha… well Agatha was a whole other battlefield. One that her own heart was in the centre of; unarmed, unshielded, and no doubt mere hours away from being crushed beneath the weight of her own dark duty.
    </p>
    <p>
     She drew to a halt beside Billy, who was still standing beside the mud, unsure of which direction to take or which part of himself to follow; his brain which evidently wanted to follow after Agatha, or his heart, where his loyalty to the others lived.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deciding to throw him a bone, primarily due to the gratitude she felt for him helping Agatha in a way Rio couldn’t, she nodded her chin toward the puddle of gloopy mud, “they’re not in there”.
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked surprised that she was talking to him at all, then eager as what she had said registered in his mind, “they’re not? How do you know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She shrugged, feeling the weight of the universe and her duty balancing on her shoulders like rusty anchors, dragging her down into a familiar darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just do,” was the only answer she would provide, before passing him to follow after her wife, her wife who she was certain would truly, without question, despise her for what she was about to do.

     The next trial was perhaps, the most cinematic of them all. The scene was a majestic one, regal even; a soaring turret of dappled stone, lit only by the flickering amber glow of torches, with a single table standing in the centre of a circular room. A deck of tarot cards were set upon it’s varnished surface, waiting for the fortunes hidden between cards to be revealed and made true.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was, quite obviously, Lilia’s trial.
    </p>
    <p>
     Which would have been evidenced by the tarot cards alone, yet even more weight was added to her theory by the fact all three of them had been dressed in the costume of a famous witch from modern day cinema or television. A portrayal Lilia, over the last few days, had driven home how much she despised, by the endless rants on the appropriation of witch culture.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha span, enjoying the twirl of her coattails and the flare of her fitted purple trousers beneath her new tailored jacket. Her skin was green, so it was pretty obvious who The Road had cast her as; the Wicked Witch of the West. A witch so evil the entirety of Oz celebrated her demise.
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced down to take in her outfit, noticing just how closely it resembled a school uniform, wondering momentarily why it didn’t consist of the black robes made famous in the original film.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Ah
     </i>
     . Suddenly the penny dropped. So she was Elphaba; a misunderstood witch who was demonised beyond measure, yet who, although misconceived, had a heart of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried to swallow the snort of derision that tried to escape at that
     <i>
      particular
     </i>
     comparison before turning to study Teen and Rio, curious to see who they had been cast as in this unusual play.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen was wearing an elaborate costume primarily crafted from black leather and dark blue velvet. The costume alone was pretty ambiguous, yet when paired with curved horns and exceptional eye make up, it was clear he was dressed as Maleficent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unsure but unbothered to find out why he had been cast as that particular witch, her eyes continued on toward the only other figure in the room. And the moment they locked on target, Agatha felt the muscles keeping her jaw in place loosen from awed surprise, leaving her standing there gaping, without any pretence or shame, directly at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t know which famous witch she had been styled after, nor did could she say what piece of media her image had been stolen from.
    </p>
    <p>
     All she knew was Rio was standing in the centre of the room in a blood red, fitted dress that was as low-cut in the chest as her 70s outfit had been. In contrast to the tight bodice, the sleeves were airier and draping away from her wrists in a triangular style that reminded Agatha of the type of dress a queen from a fairy tale would wear. Rio's hair had grown significantly, and now reached her hips. It was gently waved, with two plaits pulled away from her face and curled together into an elaborate knot on the back of her head, and around her throat was a decadent choker, with a centrepiece that looked similar to Agatha’s own broach in size and style.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of that was enough to grab Agatha’s attention, yet most shocking of all, was the fact Rio’s dark hair was now a rich auburn, a colour that complimented her tanned skin and her dark eyes almost too well.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Holy shit
     </i>
     ,” Agatha finally managed to mumble. Her legs started to move without conscious thought, taking her closer to Rio who was running curious hands over her fitted bodice and grasping the ends of her now visible hair to study it’s new colour. Agatha drew to an unsteady stop in front of her, causing Rio to glance up with curious eyes the moment she did so, as though unsure as to what it was Agatha was staring at.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, in order to make her thoughts clear and avoid any misunderstandings, she repeated her earlier sentiment of, “
     <i>
      holy shit
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You good?” Rio asked, taking a step closer to tilt Agatha’s chin up so she could see her face from beneath the brim of her witch’s hat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck me Vidal, you look
     <i>
      good
      <i>
       ,” Agatha husked, starting to circle Rio so she could get the view of her in
       <i>
        that
       </i>
       dress from the back too.
      </i>
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do?” Rio asked, sounding genuinely intrigued as she started to spin in a circle as well, trying to catch a glimpse of herself like a dog might chase its tail.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” Agatha said, voice husky as her eyes continued to trace up and down Rio’s body, “
     <i>
      you do
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled, although Agatha was quick to notice that it wasn’t like her other mad grins, for it didn’t brighten her entire face. Instead, it looked as though something was bothering her, something that had taken root inside her thoughts and started to rot, preventing her joy from blooming to it’s full potential.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha frowned for a moment before an answer became clear. Rio was probably, much like Teen, grieving the loss of the others. So, in a quick bid to distract her, Agatha tapped a finger against her own chin as she studied Rio once more, this time from a more analytical perspective rather than a lustful one.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have no idea who you are supposed to be,” her brow furrowed. “Billy!” She called out, not removing her gaze from Rio's own, “any ideas who she's supposed to be? I’m assuming this particular witch is from this century, which is why I don’t know her”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen, who had been studying his cheekbones in the mirror, turned towards them. His head tilted curiously for a brief moment before his eyes widened with realisation, “aah, I know who she is! She’s Melisandre from Game of Thrones!”
    </p>
    <p>
     ”
     <i>
      Melisandre?
     </i>
     ” Both Agatha and Rio parroted simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah!” Teen’s excitement made it clear he was a fan of the show, “she’s this badass bitch who can cast fire and shadows! Oh yeah, and she can resurrect corpses and like give birth to monsters”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes gleamed in that wild, feral way that made Agatha’s heart pound, which it did immediately, as she murmured a satisfied, “neat”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen gestured towards the table in the centre of the room, “it’s a tarot challenge! I know this… kind of”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The three of them gathered around the table. Teen picked up the deck of cards as an anxious expression spread across his face. “I’ll read for one of you two, I guess,” he said, looking between Agatha and Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Read for her,” Rio ordered quickly, almost suspiciously so. Agatha turned and stared at her through narrowed eyes from below the shadowed brim of her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Always so quick to dart out of the spotlight, aren’t you?” Agatha drawled, “afraid we’ll discover something dark and dangerous about you, Vidal?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s cheek twitched as though she wanted to laugh at Agatha’s accusation. “Something like that, Harkness,” she murmured before pulling the seat out for Agatha to sit, “please, humour me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed petulantly and took the offered seat, although she ensured her narrow-eyed glare remained fixed on Rio suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
     ”You’re lucky I’m only ever interested in hearing about myself," she said through a scowl before turning back to face Teen, who had sat himself opposite her and started to shuffle the deck of cards. “Go on then,” she spread a dramatic hand over the table, “let’s hear how my future is panning out, oh great and mysterious Teen”.
    </p>
    <p>
     He gave her a long-suffering stare from across the table as he pulled a card from the deck, “you do know you can say my name now, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Smiling brightly, she ignored his question and slapped an impatient hand on the table, “come on psychic Sally, time’s-a-wasting”.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a roll of his eyes, Teen turned the first card over and studied it with a frown, “the horse drawn carria-”.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      “The
      <i>
       chariot?
      </i>
      ” She drawled pointedly.
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     He glared at her, prompting her to raise both eyebrows at him in condescending disbelief and say, “it’s literally written on the card”.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was his turn to ignore her now, as he continued on with her tarot reading, “right, so obviously you’re leaving somewhere behind, and you have these sphinxes with you, and they represent your… your mysteriousness”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have a real gift,” Agatha commented, voice as dry as a bone left in the desert.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This card hasn’t really come up much for me,” he sniped before slapping it down into one of the empty square’s that had been carved into the table’s surface, evidently for this very purpose. However, the moment the card touched wood, a swooshing sound echoed around them, followed swiftly by a violent clang as a sword fell from the ceiling, driving itself with the force of it’s fall into the wooden floorboards, triggering as well, the ceiling to start dropping closer inch by ominous inch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both she and Teen jumped. Rio however, ever unfazed, simply drifted toward the sword to tug it from the floor, where she then started to swing it around in precise, well-formed stances.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who never found it hard to stare at Rio doing anything, leered over her shoulder to admire the flex of Rio’s arm muscles as she swung the sword above her head and mimed driving it into an imaginary foe.
    </p>
    <p>
     ”You have excellent form,” she husked, before yelping in pain the moment Teen kicked her in the shin under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     ”Concentrate!” He snapped. Obviously the stress of the sword-covered ceiling slowly lowering itself towards them was getting to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     She scowled at him in warning, but relented and gestured impatiently for him to draw another card.
    </p>
    <p>
     ”Seven of Swords”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gave a pointed glance toward Rio who was still throwing the sword around and then at the ceiling, “at least you’re on theme”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know this one!” Billy chirped, far too proud of himself, “It’s about deception and betrayal!”
    </p>
    <p>
     She hummed, “check, check”.
    </p>
    <p>
     He glanced back at the card and frowned, “but it’s reversed… so that means the opposite”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio came back to stand beside them, having slid the sword into the belt of her dress to rest beside her knife, “it mean’s she’s telling you the truth,” she told him, before shrugging “at least this time”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately picking up on the gauntlet of teasing Rio had set down before him, Teen smirked and said “well, that can’t be right,” before slapping the second card on the second square, causing, once more, a razor-sharp sword to drop to the floor with an ominous clang.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having had quite enough of being both the object of their mockery, and existing under the threat of a slowly descending death, Agatha snatched the deck from Teen’s hand, “
     <i>
      my turn
     </i>
     . Tarot is a con like any other! There’s no magic to it, there’s no skill!” She started to explain, whilst shuffling the cards in order to redraw them for him instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s not true!” Billy argued, “It’s about intuition, knowing which card to pull. And it’s about interpretation, divining their meaning”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Kid has a point,” Rio commented lightly, as though their discussion was about little more than the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
     Choosing to ignore them both, Agatha said instead, “
     <i>
      eenie meanie miney mo!
     </i>
     ” Before throwing the first card she pulled from the deck down onto the table with a dramatic smack.
    </p>
    <p>
     A sword clanged into the floor beside them, far closer than the previous two. Rio collected it as she had the first, sliding it into her belt to rest alongside the others as Agatha started slapping card after card down onto the table, causing sword after sword to drop from the ceiling. One of the cards would end up in the right place eventually, it was merely a matter of trial and error.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Slow down!
     </i>
     ” Teen cried, fearfully looking at the ceiling, before staring at Rio with wide eyes and raised eyebrows, imploring her to do
     <i>
      something
     </i>
     to stop Agatha’s tarot tirade. Yet she simply shrugged at him, before pulling a few more swords from the floor, completely at ease in a room primed to kill her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chose to ignore him again, right up until the moment a sword fell directly where he had been sitting. Fortunately, it missed him by a grazing inch, as he threw himself to the floor just in time to avoid being impaled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your turn is going great,” he quipped sarcastically from the floor, clinging onto the table with scrabbling fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is a numbers game,” she told him flippantly, “we keep at it until we get the right cards in the right spots, or the ceiling runs out of swords!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not sure how much math you did back in Salem-” Teen started to say, voice sullen and filled with teenage frustration before Rio interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Literally none, she refused to do any arithmetic. Claimed it was the devil’s work and that it would turn her into a witch,” Rio told him with a snort of amusement at the memory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scowled, feeling annoyance bubble in her stomach for several reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first; Teen and his unrelenting sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second; Rio’s eagerness to pull back the curtain on the reputation she had worked so hard to build over
     <i>
      centuries
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     And the third; the fact Rio could recall these moments from their shared past with ease, a past that was still little more than a black hole swirling through her hexed mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We still have time!” She growled, pointing to the hourglass with snappy irritability.
    </p>
    <p>
     ”I wish Lilia was here,” Teen groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as though he had summoned her with his yearning alone, a cupboard door swung open spewing Lilia, Jen, and Alice out to land in a heap on the varnished floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     ”
     <i>
      You’re alive!
     </i>
     ” Billy cried joyously, running over to wrap each of them up one by one in a warm embrace. “Thank god,” he sounded near tears as he squeezed his grip around Alice’s shoulders who squeaked at the tightness of his arms, “I thought I’d killed all of you guys!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Relax baby, we’re cool,” Lilia reassured him, “young witches lose control of their power all of the time,” she eyed him closely, looking, if Agatha didn’t know any better, like an excessively proud parent, “your magic’s got a kick to it kid, you should be pleased”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A kick; a kick in the head more like,” Jen drawled, not quite as forgiving as Lilia or Alice over their trip through a muddy portal. Although, Jen's attention was promptly stolen by the outfit she had been dressed in for this particular trial.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the fuck,” she scowled and pinched the edge of her ragged robe, causing a few of her grey locks to fall over her shoulder into her eyeline, “
     <i>
      what. The. actual. Fuck. Is. This
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Spinning she stared at Lilia, before throwing out a petulant hand, “so you get Glinda, and I get the
     <i>
      Evil Queen?!
     </i>
     And not even the hot Evil Queen, oh no, I get
     <i>
      Crone Evil Queen?!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her attention fell on Alice who had joined Rio in admiring the many swords she had collected from the floor. Agatha was unsure why Rio had done so, for it wasn’t like they could transport them all even if they wanted to. Yet Rio’s quirks were, as always, as endearing as they were curious, and Agatha couldn’t deny the fond smile that bloomed on her face as she watched Rio show Alice just how well balanced the swords were, both of them completely unaware they were the current focus of Jen’s jealous upset.
    </p>
    <p>
     ”Oh for fuck’s sake! Rio got
     <i>
      Melisandre!
     </i>
     And Alice got
     <i>
      Nancy Downs!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s outrage caught Agatha’s attention, and she couldn’t resist studying Alice either, who had been dressed in a short black skirt, a white shirt, and a baggy leather jacket. It was an outfit that was purely 90’s, one that was made complete with dark eyeliner and a studded choker.
    </p>
    <p>
     All in all, Alice looked hot. And Agatha, ever the faithful agent to chaos and all she entails, couldn’t resist whistling in lusty appreciation, eager to show Alice just how well her new look suited her, whilst also managing to annoy Jen too. Simple pleasures and all that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Looking good Alice,” Agatha drawled through a smirk which was directed at Jen, whom The Road had dressed in a large baggy robe and gifted a monobrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen, polite as ever, pointed both of her middle finger's at Agatha who couldn’t resist blowing her a kiss in reply, “don’t be jealous Kale. Only one witch in this coven has a one way ticket to my bed, and her name rhymes with Cleo Ridal”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen snorted with disdain at Agatha’s taunting, as Lilia stepped toward the table to study the tarot reading they had been in the middle of ruining, when the others had burst through the cupboard door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who massacred this spread?” She asked, judgement plain in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      He did!
     </i>
     ” “
     <i>
      She did!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Both she and Teen pointed at one another simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia rolled her eyes and started to pluck all of the cards off the table to reshuffle the entire deck, “who’s the querent?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You mean the subject?” Teen asked, ever the eager student, “me, I guess I’m the queer-ent”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s forced fake chuckle was drowned out by Rio and Alice's genuine ones.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The querent shuffles and cuts,” Lilia told him, passing the deck to Teen who quickly did as ordered before passing them back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now please ask your question,” she told him, settling herself into one of the chairs with the regal grace of an ancient monarch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are we gunna get out of here?” Agatha asked loudly. It was, after all, the most obvious and important question to ask in their current situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia glared at her, “Teen must ask”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Ask her how we’re getting out?
     </i>
     ” Agatha whispered at him across the table very loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It must be vital to his journey on Earth!” Lilia scolded her, just like a teacher would berate a misbehaving child.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’d say it’s pretty vital,” Agatha quipped, pointing at the ceiling which was still inching ever closer to all of their grisly deaths.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen looked between them both for a moment before asking the question that had evidently been playing on his mind, “am I William, or am I Billy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s a very good question,” Lilia told him kindly, before explaining what each card’s placement meant. The reading continued for several minutes, although even Lilia’s cards, whilst being read and placed correctly, caused the swords to continue falling from the ceiling. Then suddenly, as though someone had opened her mind and plucked her consciousness from it, Lilia sagged in her seat and fell silent.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Er
     </i>
     ,” Agatha pointed at her, glancing at Jen and Alice who had both drawn closer to Lilia to check she was alright, “the lights appear to be on, but no one is home”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lilia,” Jen said, shaking her shoulder impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t be so rough with her,” Teen scolded, grabbing Jen’s wrist to pull it away from Lilia’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She was doing this in the tunnels...” Alice explained, ever the voice of reason and calm, “...kept talking about you...” she nodded at Teen, “...about the trial, about bookshelves, about gaps, flashes in time, and the Scarlet Witch”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The
     <i>
      Scarlet Witch?
     </i>
     ” Agatha growled, prowling closer, “Lilia knows about him?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice nodded, shrugging nonchalantly, “we all do now”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy grinned sheepishly, “can’t help who your parents are and all that”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, don’t I know it,” Alice said sadly, thinking of a misunderstood mother who she had despised for far too long.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha however simply scowled and pointed out, “you all had the pleasure of meeting my mother”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen and Alice’s responding grimaces spoke a thousand words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched then as the card Lilia had been holding in a limp hand slipped from between lax fingers and landed on the table, causing the sword directly above her seat to come screaming down, right towards her still body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Shit!
     </i>
     ” She hissed, and without prior thought for self-preservation, an anomaly in Agatha’s long life, she found herself leaping forward and pushing Lilia from her seat before the soaring blade could run her through.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agatha!
     </i>
     ” Lilia cried, apparently back in the room from her vacation to wherever-the-hell-she-just-been, “
     <i>
      what are you doing?!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     It was obvious Lilia was talking about the fact she had ended up sprawled atop her after Agatha's act of selfless heroism, “did you not see imminent impalement in your future?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Being good really was overrated; you save a life and all you get in return is grief, she couldn't help but think as Lilia groaned in irritation and began to push her off and onto the floor with impatient hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Lilia!
     </i>
     ” Agatha yelped as she was shunted sideways to land on her ass, “I’m trying to help you!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Yeah, yeah, yeah
     </i>
     ,” Lilia drawled sarcastically, managing to finally haul herself to her feet, a motion not made any easier by her large, fluffy skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio approached Agatha, who was still sat on the floor with a disbelieving, resentful expression on her face at Lilia’s lack of gratitude. With a small smirk, Rio held a hand out to help Agatha off the floor as she said, “that was very brave, sweetheart”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know,” Agatha pouted, annoyed no one was giving her act of selflessness the appropriate attention or praise it deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried to release her hand, but a sudden, overwhelming desire to keep her close came over Agatha, so she tightened her grip instead and hauled Rio into her side, so she could wrap a possessive arm around her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know...” she couldn’t resist whispering into her ear, even though both of their eyes were still trained on Lilia, who had started shuffling the cards with a newfound intensity, “...I didn’t think I had a thing for redheads until
     <i>
      right now
     </i>
     . I thought Wanda had set that particular boat on fire as it set sail, but seeing you like this...” she gave the ends of Rio’s hair a teasing tug, “...well, it’s doing wonderful things for me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was the point in the conversation that Rio would normally smirk and whisper something devilishly wicked into her ear, yet Rio’s responding smile was like a small flame flickering in a furious gale; weak and hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha frowned, tugging Rio back towards her the moment she tried to look away and back towards Lilia, who was now giving
     <i>
      herself
     </i>
     the reading? Which did make sense in some warped, of-course-The-Road-would-design-it-like-this sort of way.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, what is it? What’s wrong?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed; a sound crafted from sadness. Her eyes flickered across Agatha’s face, as though she was trying to absorb every minute detail before she shook her head, “nothing”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, don’t do that,” Agatha ordered, refusing to be locked out of Rio’s thoughts in the same way she was locked out of her own, “tell me what’s wrong”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes started to shine with unshed tears as her mouth dropped open, as though she was uncertain of what was about to come out, “I-”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t get an opportunity to answer however, for screams of fear from the others dragged their attention onto the ceiling which was still moving towards them, and getting nerve-wrackingly close.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia though, was frozen in place, a single card held above the final space and her eyes set on Rio with grim awareness, “Rio is…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lilia!” Alice cried, grabbing the card from Lilia’s hand to slap it down on the table, stopping the ceiling from moving any closer and impaling them all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia didn’t flinch at Alice’s tone, nor did she celebrate the fact she had successfully beaten her trial. No, instead she simply continued to stare at Rio. Then she swallowed, almost nervously, “Rio…” Lilia's voice trembled from what sounded like partial fear, and partial reverence, “you… you’re…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt Rio stand taller beside her as she swept closer toward the divination witch, “I am…”
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t sound angry or insulted, if anything she sounded gentle, speaking like a mother might to a child who had just learned that the earth was round or the sun was a star. “It’s alright,” Rio said softly, “you can say it, you can tell them”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia gulped, eyes scanning Rio’s expression for any hint of deception before nodding once and turning to address the others, “Rio, our green witch, she is
     <i>
      the
     </i>
     green witch”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha frowned, not completely understanding the weight of Lilia's revelation, before Jen gasped sharply and took an uneasy step backwards, “you can't mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Lilia said to Jen before turning to stare at Rio with wonder, “she’s-”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia was cut off by Alice, who in her stoic, calm voice provided the answer for all of them, “Death”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment the truth was revealed Rio spun, eyes set upon Agatha’s face, watching intently for her reaction, which was to pause for a moment as her synapses caught up to her ears and the true depths of what she had just heard came into sharp clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s
     <i>
      what?!
     </i>
     ” Agatha hissed, storming closer to Rio with narrowed eyes, “you’re
     <i>
      what?!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio, fool that she was, simply threw both hands up into a sad impression of jazz hands and said through a limp smile, “surprise”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha reeled back, throwing a palm to her forehead and knocking her hat to the ground as one of those familiar, aching pains shot through her mind at the knowledge she had just discovered, knowledge that must match the memories Wanda’s magic was still working so hard to hide from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thankfully, the pain didn’t last long and Agatha was left staring at Rio, gaping in awe at the fact she, Agatha Harkness, had not only managed to pull one of the most disarmingly attractive people she had ever had the pleasure of staring at, but also, an
     <i>
      immortal deity
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Holy shit
     </i>
     ,” she breathed, running ravenous eyes up Rio’s body, as understanding and realisations fell into place. This was the reason Rio had refused to kiss her until she knew Agatha wouldn’t steal her magic, this is why Rio never feared for her life in these hellish trials, this was why she disappeared after every single death or brush with it on The Road, this was why she seemed so damn curious about such mundane human things like a fucking
     <i>
      rubix cube
     </i>
     ; because she wasn’t human.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was clear that everyone, including Rio, were all holding their breath awaiting an eruption of anger that never came. Yet all Agatha did instead was smirk, a particularly devilish, wolfish expression as she drawled, “well, I’m certainly glad to learn my type hasn’t changed, even with all the brain damage. I always had a thing for the dangerous ones, after all”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s mouth opened to reply, but whatever she was going to say, Agatha never got hear, because those same eery whispers that had woken them the night before started to echo around the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
     The scurrying of rat’s feet, the ruffle of feathers, and the sound of a snake’s belly slithering along stone joined the ominous voices, as Lilia pointed toward the exit that had been revealed the moment the final card had been laid.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The seven. They’re here! Quick, everyone in the iron maiden!”
    </p>
    <p>
     They didn’t hesitate to do as ordered. Agatha went first, her hand this time firmly wrapped around Rio’s wrist, refusing to let her stay behind again as she had in the cabin. A pointless thing, considering her…
     <i>
      girlfriend? Wife? Ex?
     </i>
     (She still wasn’t entirely sure what they were to one another officially), was apparently Death incarnate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet the moment she heard Jen yell “no!” from the stair below her own and the maiden door slam shut, with all of them except Lilia on the side of safety, she realised what Lilia intended to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Lilia!
     </i>
     ” Jen cried, banging both her fists on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah no, RIP Lilia,” Agatha sighed and waited a solemn moment with a hand over her heart, before immediately trying to turn and carry on up the stairs. Yet, she was halted by Rio who was still stood in place watching Alice, who had quickly snapped into action.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jen, get away from the door,” Alice ordered, as she placed both of her glowing palms against it’s handle and pushed it open with a roar. The metal screamed as it was pushed away from the doorframe, before with a final cry through gritted teeth, Alice managed to shunt it open.
    </p>
    <p>
     The scene that met them wasn’t the one they had left, for everything inside the tower was now upside down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Three black shapes went sailing past the doorway; three of the Salem Seven falling to their deaths which were quicker than they deserved if the grim squelch of metal through flesh was any indicator.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, like a petal from a cherry blossom drifting on the breeze, Lilia dropped from the candelabra she had been clinging too. Her eyes were closed, her limbs were relaxed; the old witch was apparently ready to walk into Rio’s cold embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her peaceful descent to the end of her life was intercepted however by a current of yellow magic, one that acted as a trampoline and caught her mid-air, causing her to bounce inelegantly and her dress to flop over her face the moment she made impact with a grunted, “
     <i>
      umph!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Jen
     </i>
     !” Alice ground out through gritted teeth, “conjure a rope and guide her in! I don’t know how long I can hold this for!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m bound!” Jen’s panicked voice echoed around them, and in that moment Agatha felt a strong desire for her own magic, a desire that, for once, wasn’t entirely rooted in self-gratification, but rather the ability to actually help someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Aah
     </i>
     !” Alice roared, eyes clenched tightly together with concentration to ensure her power didn’t waiver and drop Lilia to her Death, who had managed to scrabble onto her knees and was trying to crawl her way across Alice's field flickering magic towards the open doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can help Alice!” Teen said, within moments he had closed his eyes and conjured a rope the colour of midnight. Without delay he tossed it to Lilia how a lifeguard would throw a safety ring to a drowning man, “Lilia! Grab hold, we’ll pull you in!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen, who couldn’t conjure anything but who could still pull, was the first to grab hold of the rope and start helping Teen drag the rope and Lilia across the room and towards the doorway. She turned her head, even as she continued to pull and growled at Rio and Agatha, “
     <i>
      help us!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio paused for a moment, as though considering whether this would break some sort of universal rule before, after a single shrug, she too grabbed hold and started to help.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agatha!
     </i>
     ” Jen cried, just as Alice’s power field failed and Lilia dropped out of sight of the door. An unusual strike of fear resounded through Agatha’s chest at that image, of Lilia crawling to safety only to suddenly disappear from view, and before Agatha knew it, she too had grabbed hold of the rope, which thankfully still had a weight upon it’s end, and started to haul backwards with the others, cinching Lilia up the wall of the tower, until two scrabbling hands suddenly appeared upon the ledge from where Alice was able to grab her under the arms and drag her all the way to safety.
    </p>
    <p>
     They all fell backwards in a domino line then; Lilia onto Alice, Alice onto Teen, Teen onto Jen, Jen onto Rio, and finally Rio onto Agatha. Which, if it was just Rio’s lovely body pressing into hers, she wouldn’t have minded, like at all. However, with the weight of her entire coven pressing down on her, she ended up slapping furious hands against any shoulder and arm she could reach, “
     <i>
      get off!
     </i>
     Oh my god,
     <i>
      get off of me!
     </i>
     You’re the heaviest coven I’ve ever not killed,
     <i>
      get off!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     This, apparently, was the funniest thing all of them had ever heard, because none of them moved off of her as she demanded, instead they all started to cackle loudly, undoubtedly as a result of skimming yet another near-death experience and the adrenaline such experiences inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s like I said…” Lilia said, the relieved smile on her face could be heard clearly in her voice, even as she leaned back against the warm bodies beneath her own, using them all as an impermanent chaise lounge, “three of pentacles; collaboration, community, singular voices waiting to harmonise”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She rolled then to stare at them all, her eyes shining with affection, affection that even Agatha felt warming her cold heart, much to her own disgust, “I needed you. My coven”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as those prophetic words settled even more profoundly between them all, considering they had only been able to save Lilia through the combined efforts of the entire group, Agatha found herself feeling, perhaps for the first time in her life, what it might be like to have a place amongst a group of witches, to truly know, and understand, what the word coven actually meant.
    </p>
    <p>
     A sentimental silence descended then as they all considered Lilia’s words carefully, although it only lasted a few seconds, as Agatha was sure her right lung was about to pop, “alright, seriously now, get the fuck off of me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     They finally did so, each of them still chuckling under their breath at the fact the great and infamous Killer-of-Witches Agatha Harkness had been their makeshift landing pad.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha got to her feet with disgruntled grace, brushing her hands down her mud-stained trousers and throwing her stringy, filthy hair over her shoulders proudly, as though it wasn’t stuck together with grime.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, now that little love-fest is over. We need to keep moving. One more trial to go and then we’ll finally claim whatever prize is waiting at the end of The Road”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A murmur of excitement abounded at her statement, although it was cut short by Rio, who instead of heading up the stairwell like the rest of them, turned to head back through the iron maiden toward the upside down tower.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stood facing them all, her back to the open doorway. A wicked grin bloomed upon her face as she tilted her chin over her shoulder, down towards the grisly remains of the three Salemites below, relishing a view only she could see.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll catch up with you guys in a bit,” she said, allowing her human face to melt away to reveal a half-skeleton, half-human visage, “duty calls”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then she dropped backwards in a swirl of black robes, disappearing from sight to complete her universally-bound duty.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Oh my god
     </i>
     ,” Agatha groaned, feeling her knees weaken as she drooped backwards against the stone wall behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh for goodness sake,” Jen crowed as she passed Agatha on the stairs, “please don’t tell me
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     did it for you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Lilia cackled loudly at Jen’s jibe, even as Teen shook his head in teenage disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha, whose weakness had always been powerful, deadly woman, simply squared her jaw, straightened her shoulders, and ascended the stairs as regally as a queen might. “It absolutely did,” she confirmed, throwing a longing stare over her shoulder to where Rio had disappeared from view, “what can I say? I like the bad boys”.

     Chapter Notes
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      My dudes. This chapter tormented me and made me write it twice. So there is a whole other version of this thing on my computer lmaooo. Why I thought trying to twine canon with my own story would be a good idea, I have no clue. But alas, I am foolish enough to continue with my endeavour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thank you to all of you guys who comment week in and week out, you guys really motivate me to finish this fic because for a moment there I was like hmmmmmmmmmm does it need an ending? But it does, and I am determined to finish it, by blood or high water it shall be done.
     </p>
     <p>
      I apologise for the rambling nature of this chapter note, but I honestly feel like I have just gone three rounds in a boxing ring with this fic and it won. So, don't feel pressured to read this whole note, it's the concussion talking.
     </p>
     <p>
      I really am hoping and praying you enjoy it, because like I said, it beat me up and took my lunch money. And of course, this one had to be the longest chapter too.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only one more main chapter to go though! We're so close!
     </p>
     <p>
      (This gets angsty in places - but I don’t do sad endings, so please do not fear!)
     </p>
     <p>
      And so, I really hope you enjoy chapter eighteen, the bane of my life! &lt;3

     <b>
      AGATHA
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Being in a body bag was a morbid experience, one that Agatha had no interest in repeating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not whilst alive at least, or for that matter, not when she was dead either; her body deserved better than
     <i>
      this
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It was claustrophobic, it was humid, and it was an exceptionally frustrating environment to be stuck in. One that brought to mind one of Agnes’s scarlet-stained memories to the forefront of her mind, one that included wrestling with a duvet cover whilst trying to change the sheets on her double bed. Which resulted in Agnes nee Agatha, becoming entangled inside of the blasted thing. Until Rio had stopped laughing long enough to actually help her escape it’s cotton clutches at least.
    </p>
    <p>
     What's more, they didn't actually find the final trial, but rather, it found them.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had stumbled over it when least expecting it. Or rather she had.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been mid-sentence, mid-outraged rant in fact. A completely justifiable tirade on the frustration she felt about tripping over shoes; shoes that they had left at the
     <i>
      beginning
     </i>
     of The Road.
    </p>
    <p>
     One moment she had been yelling at them all, demanding they come up with at least one reasonable explanation as to how they were at the fucking start
     <i>
      again
     </i>
     , and the next she was here. On a small, cramped metal rectangle, stuffed inside a thick plastic bag.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was suddenly jolted from her ire-fuelled contemplation however, when the tray her body bag was resting upon was jerked forward, quite violently too.
    </p>
    <p>
     She peered out through narrowed eyes, only to flinch back the instant she did so for a single stream of bright, white light was permeating through the small gap in her body bag's zipper. Squinting to protect her eyesight, she quickly slid two scrabbling fingers into the zipper space to tug it apart, freeing herself enough to sit up with a gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What in the-” she glanced down at herself, finding this view of her body bag no better than the one she had possessed whilst sequestered away inside it. “Ugh,” she sneered, feeling a disturbing mix of disgust and fear at the stark symbolism of her body wrapped in a black plastic, laying on a cold morgue shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking around, her eyes found Billy who was in a similar position to herself. They shared a brief look of relief to see the other, before a third tray burst from the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Help! What is this?! Let me out!
     </i>
     ” Jen’s voice was muffled, her body bag wriggling and writhing with panic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy shot to his feet eager to help, but Agatha stayed still and brushed a lock of wayward hair from her face with a lazy hand, “don’t steal her struggle”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, noble Maximoff that he was, he ignored her and rushed to help Jen open the zipper on her bag, from which she immediately sat up gulping in great, panicked lungful’s of air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moments later a tray at the top of the wall sprung open, followed promptly by the soprano screams of Lilia, which only increased in pitch the moment she sat up from her body bag and realised she was a good six feet above the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Oh my god!
     </i>
     ” She cried, peering down at them all with wide, panicked eyes, “
     <i>
      get me down!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted and placed her hands on her hips, “oh yeah, let me just get the ladder I packed, or would you prefer the elevator? Or how about a crane?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia scowled at her sarcasm, even through her fear, “will you keep that tongue of yours pleasant for
     <i>
      once
     </i>
     in your life, and actually help!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked, unable to resist the powder keg of inuendo she had just been handed for free. “My, my, my
     <i>
      Lilia Calderu
     </i>
     ,” she wiggled her eyebrows, relishing the moment Lilia’s expression dropped from fearful to unimpressed, “I didn’t know you even thought about my tongue all that much,” she winked, “good to know”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh please,” Lilia snorted waving Agatha's lecherous jest away with a flick of her hand, obviously already very tired of her antics, “will you just-” she gestured around herself, “help me!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Agatha could say or do anything else in reply, another draw two tiers beneath Lilia’s slid open.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank fuck that’s over,” Alice drawled, sitting up slowly and calmy, as though she was completely unphased to have been laying in a body bag on a morgue slab for the past ten minutes or so.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice!” Teen cried, pleased to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What’s up Billy,” Alice grinned at him, saluted at Jen, and then glanced up at Lilia who had also shrieked her name the moment her tray had popped from the wall just below her own.  “Lilia,” Alice said in greeting, trying valiantly to stifle a laugh at the older witch’s evident, and very shrill panic, “here, use my tray as a step down. I’ll help you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice did so, helping Lilia scramble from her own drawer onto Alice’s, and then down further onto the floor where Teen and Jen stood with open hands, ready to catch her. Once Lilia was safely on the ground, Alice climbed down too, making the whole thing look like a walk in the park compared to Lilia's nervous scrabbling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where are we?” Jen asked, starting to circle the room to look for a hint or a clue as to how this trial could be started or won. She looked up and pointed, a frown marring her face, “these are grow lights… are we supposed to grow something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “In a place with no
     <i>
      soil
     </i>
     or
     <i>
      water?
     </i>
     ” Agatha sniped, leaning back against the wall behind her with her arms crossed over her chest. “It certainly has the irritating sting of a Witches Road trial”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen ignored her jibe and continued running restless hands across the walls, still searching for clues whilst Agatha pinned her broach to the drab, grey gown she had been forced to wear. She immediately felt better the moment she had it attached to her person, and allowed herself a moment to inhale deeply, bracing herself for another round with The Witches Road.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, making them all jump, a loud ticking noise echoed around the room. Lilia grabbed Alice’s arm to haul her close, whilst Teen started to glance around the room, spinning in a circle, as though searching for the source of the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And now we have our countdown,” Agatha drawled, her eyes following Jen, who seemed like the most proactive member of their coven, for she was the only one still trying to find a trial starting-point in this sealed, grey room. “You seem relaxed,” Agatha jeered at her, unable to stop herself; old habits die hard and all that. “Usually, at this point you’re either complaining loudly or freaking out loudly”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m
     <i>
      thinking!
     </i>
     ” Jen snapped back, her frustration at Agatha’s sniping unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, about what?” Agatha asked brightly, as though enquiring where she had bought her necklace, and not a plan to escape an enchanted trial that would kill them all without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen scowled at her from across the room, “how to save your ass”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha inhaled as though scandalised, before exclaiming with flare, "
     <i>
      pardon?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen waved a hand at her, as though Agatha was little more than an irritating fly buzzing around her head. “We need to think about this logically. Every trial we have faced has had a point... or a lesson attached to it".
    </p>
    <p>
     She pointed at Agatha, “you said it yourself, The Road tests us, one trial per skill. Potions: the beach house. Protection witch: killing a demon and breaking the curse”. Jen pointed at each of them as she listed their trials and skills.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dealing with Death…” Jen arched a pointed brow towards Agatha at that particular statement, although Agatha couldn't tell whether she was referring to Agatha’s long list of people she had killed, or what was more likely following Rio’s recent revelation, the fact she had been up close and personal with Death, and not in a life-threatening way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen continued through a smirk, evidently pleased with herself for getting at least one jab in at Agatha, who had rolled her eyes in and scoffed petulantly in response. “The last trial was Lilia's: divination, which leaves one practice left:
     <i>
      green magic
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen threw her hands up with realisation, gesturing around them, “this is Rio’s trial!” She then immediately sagged with disappointment, “...and Rio isn’t here”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quite suddenly, just as quickly as they had done so before, two drawers slammed open on the opposite side of the room, both of them side by side and casting a thick shadow across the grey floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, Lilia squealed as both Alice and Teen spun around to quickly locate the threat. Yet much to all of their confusion, no body bags were on either of the shelves, and Rio, who was the only unaccounted for member of their party, was not laid out on either table, much to Agatha’s disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, as though her thoughts alone had summoned her, or perhaps it was Jen’s sulking, the morgue shelves shadows, started to stretch and bloom, until a black mass started to grow from the ground right in the centre of the room. The shadow started to take shape then, darkening into swirls of fabric that fell towards the floor in elegant swoops until finally, Rio was in front of them, dressed in robes crafted from the night sky, robes that allowed several devastatingly appealingly flashes of skin to show, including two long strips of thigh and a captivating glimpse of her ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced around. Her demeanour as always, was relaxed. “Yo,” she greeted them all, throwing a lazy hand up in a wave as though her face wasn’t still half skeleton. A frown fell across her expression at their frozen reaction to her sudden appearance, so in an attempt at levity she threw her hands up and did a lacklustre cheer, “woo final trial! We made it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, she glanced from face to face, taking note of their fearful expressions, “is it something I said?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cleared her throat, drawing Rio’s dark eyes toward her which, unhelpfully in her current situation, caused a pulse of heat to stir low in her stomach at just how dangerous Rio looked like this; the all-powerful deity come out to play for all to see. A deity that was apparently, all Agatha's.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think they’re a bit taken aback by your…” Agatha waved a discreet finger at her own chin, indicating the lower half of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly, Rio’s eyebrows rose in surprise, as though she had completely forgotten half of her face was devoid of skin, “oh yeah, let me just-”. And then, with awe-inspiring ease, Rio brought an arm up and swiped it down in front of her own face, causing tanned skin to stitch itself together over bare bone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Better?” She asked once her face was human again, or at least human-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked back at her, “I mean, I have no complaints either way". She took a few steps closer, feeling the curiosity that had gotten her into all sorts of trouble over the centuries bubbling to life as she studied Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio who was Death. Rio who was also entirely dedicated to ensuring Agatha was happy; like her very own fallen angel. one she couldn’t remember, much to her ever-growing frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you can dissolve your own face
     <i>
      and
     </i>
     travel by shadow?” She asked, eyes wandering up and down Rio’s outfit, enjoying seeing her in the infamous dark robe of her trade.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can,” Rio answered, “amongst other things”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you help us figure this trial out?” Lilia asked loudly, and rather boldly too, “time’s ticking and this is technically your trial”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced over her shoulder toward Lilia, who much to her credit, didn’t flinch the moment Death laid her eyes upon her person.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged, nonchalant as ever, "not much greenery in here for a green witch to work with”. She span in a circle, eyes dragging from the body bags to the morgue shelves, before falling to the grey robes each of them were dressed in. Everyone paused and held their breath, for it looked, for a brief moment at least, as though Rio was building up to impart some immortal knowledge to them, something that would rival the universe and its wisdom, something that would guide them toward the correct path and help them figure out what they had to do to pass this test.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of that however, or anything remotely helpful, they received another shrug, this time accompanied by a loud sigh. Rio then hauled herself up to perch on one of the morgue shelves, where she sat like a child on a fence with her legs kicking in the air, waiting for them to figure it out for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted with amusement, “well aren’t you a font of helpful advice. Seriously, what is the point of having an immortal deity for a girlfriend if she isn’t going to help you escape deadly, enchanted trials?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen's smile was smug and very middle school, making Agatha feel like she and Rio had just been paired together for seven-minutes-in-heaven, “
     <i>
      girlfriend?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio, a figure feared across time, space, cultures and realms simply blushed and playing nervously with the edge of her robe, “well, that isn’t technically-”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever intriguing piece of information Rio was about to divulge was promptly disrupted by Jen, who once again threw her hands in the air and gestured to the room around them. “We
     <i>
      do not
     </i>
     have time for this right now. We couldn’t save Sharon, but I’ll be damned if the rest of us are going to die here”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wow,” Agatha drawled, turning to smirk at Jen, “such purpose. How are you going to do that without magic?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy stepped between the two of them. “She saved my life, she saved you from poisoning. All while bound…”, he said to Agatha before turning to address Jen with an endearing smile, “…maybe you don’t need it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen looked stricken at the thought, “well, if that’s true, that means I’ve wasted the last century of my life. That doctor in Boston didn’t take anything from me,” her eyes looked glassy as she said solemnly, “I gave it up”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hardly heard the end of her sentence though, for it suddenly struck her that Jen had been bound in
     <i>
      Boston
     </i>
     . A city in which Agatha herself had been selling the odd witch-binding spell for a small fee back in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     The look of surprise that crossed her face, the one Agatha had been certain hadn't been clocked by anyone, was then promptly pointed out by Alice and her police-trained senses.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?” She asked curiously, taking a step closer with a small crease between her brows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha span toward her with a forced air of innocence to answer the question Alice hadn't actually asked aloud, “nothing”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it?” Jen asked, having sensed as well that Agatha wasn’t been entirely honest about something; story of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugged nonchalantly, “no, I just… I never knew you ever passed through there. That’s all”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently she had done a terrible job of being nonchalant however, because almost immediately, Jen’s face collapsed with fury, “are
     <i>
      you
     </i>
     the one who bound me!?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha threw her arms up, honestly not entirely sure of the answer herself, “I don’t know!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      What?!
     </i>
     ” Jen hissed, “you nonstop
     <i>
      sociopath!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen looked as shocked as Agatha felt, “
     <i>
      you’re
     </i>
     the one who bound her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You kept me like this for one hundred years?!” Jen growled, taking a few furious steps closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn’t know it was
     <i>
      you!
     </i>
     ” Agatha argued, “it was the 1920s! I did the odd spell for bank notes,” she glanced at all of them one at a time, registering the anger in their expressions. All of them aside from Rio, who was frowning heavily at Jen from her perch with her muscles tensed and her hand firmly on her knife. As discreetly as Agatha could, she shook her head at Rio, certain that the last thing they needed right now was a civil war, before continuing to excuse her past actions. “I don’t know! The patriarchy really shelled out to shush a lady. It was bind or burn!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      One hundred years!
     </i>
     ” Jen hissed, the anger and resentment sparking clearly in her dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is so
     <i>
      awkward
     </i>
     ,” Agatha murmured, before yelping in pain from Jen ripping a chunk of hair from her head, “Ow! Oh god! Jen,
     <i>
      that is my hair!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen didn’t hear her, or more likely didn't care to listen, for in the next instant she had grabbed Agatha’s wrists to start wrapping her own stolen hair around them, “why are you doing this right-“. She rolled her eyes, “look at where we are!
     <i>
      Jen!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen looked between Jen and herself, announcing in a solemn voice what was obvious to all of them, “the unbinding ritual”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen grabbed Agatha's bound wrists and hauled her closer, until they were standing face to face and Agatha could see the true extent of Jen’s pain in her expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I
     <i>
      deny
     </i>
     your power over me,” Jen’s voice was a resounding order, a serious tone that denied any argument or adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
     And like with all things, Agatha’s initial reaction was to mock and belittle the other, “attagirl, good for you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agatha
     </i>
     ,” Billy’s sharp voice cut her off, although it was echoed by both Lilia and Alice, who had also stepped closer to witness Jen’s reclamation of her power.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You hold
     <i>
      nothing
     </i>
     ,” Jen said, voice shaking with anger and desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Say it like you mean it though Jen,” Agatha drawled, glancing down at Jen’s lips momentarily. She tried to play it off as a joke, but in truth, she found this dominant, powerful version of Jennifer Kale had succeeded in lighting a small spark of attraction in her stomach. A feeling that was not at all helped by having her wrists bound. What can she say, she’s only human and powerful witches were, and always had been, her weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You hold
     <i>
      nothing
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah well…” Agatha felt a wave of shame overshadowing her attraction then as Jen's devastated expression hardened. It was a sensation she had only felt once or twice through her long life, a sensation she still despised as desperately as she had the first time she had felt it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      You hold nothing. You hold nothing. You hold nothing…
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen continued to chant those three words over and over, and as she did so, Agatha felt herself softening entirely, watching with eyes that gentled the desperate desire playing out across Jen’s face to be reunited with her magic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn't help but empathise, as her mind fell to thoughts of the green witch in the corner of the room, whose history with Agatha had been shackled within her mind in the same cruel way Jen’s magic had been bound one hundred years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, what felt like a wave of power rippled from Agatha through Jen who then gasped and stumbled backwards, releasing her hold on Agatha's wrists. Tears started to pool in Jen's eyes and dribble down her cheeks as she, with a mesmerised expression, flicked her hands to summon her pink power, which immediately sparked around her hands in beautiful, flashing swirls.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen collapsed to her knees, evidently overwhelmed at feeling her magic ripple under her skin again, and at having reclaimed control over such a huge part of herself. And then, quite suddenly, as though she had never been there in the first place, Jen gasped a second time and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia shot forward to where Jen had been kneeling, eyes wide with alarm, “what happened? Where did she go? She was just there! Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, the meaning, followed promptly by the understanding of Jen’s disappearance, settled in Agatha’s mind like a single leaf on a pond; gently and with little fanfare.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was obvious, almost insultingly so.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Of course
     </i>
     that was the end of The Road, and of course it was Rio’s trial considering who she was; the ultimate ending.
    </p>
    <p>
     The prize to be won wasn’t something that they had a choice over, nor was it something in-general, or to be requested. It was specific to each of them, just like their trials had been.
    </p>
    <p>
     The prize was the resolution of their lives largest, and most profound hurdles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s biggest issue was being bound, and having reclaimed it using her own voice and actions she had beaten The Road.
    </p>
    <p>
     Spinning with urgency, Agatha shared her revelation with the others, “you need to claim your own power. That’s how you win”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia stared at her, eyes still wide with fear for Jen and her sudden disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Seriously,” Agatha swept closer and grasped her shoulders with both hands, being for once, entirely serious and completely sincere. “Think about your trial. Think about what you learned about yourself”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia’s jaw wobbled as her eyes flickered across Agatha’s face, “I- I read for myself, I put it all in order, I made sense of all my flashes”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Agatha breathed, not entirely sure what Lilia meant but still encouraging her to continue exploring her own success all the same, “and how long have the gaps between flashes been holding you back? How long has living that way stopped you from stepping forward and claiming everything you deserve out of this life?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Clouding with the weight of her past, Lilia’s eyes glazed slightly, “my whole life”. Her confession was a quiet murmur, one that Agatha pursued relentlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And
     <i>
      now?
     </i>
     ” She tightened her grip on Lilia’s shoulders, shaking her slightly to bring the older witch’s focus back onto her words, “after The Road? After beating it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     A proud smile started to bloom on Lilia’s face and her shoulders straightened, as she said with the brassy confidence of a woman who had been alive for four and a half centuries, “that I am
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     a forgotten woman. That I am
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     lost. That I am a traveller possessing a gift as valuable as the earth; that I
     <i>
      am
     </i>
     and always
     <i>
      have been
     </i>
     the queen of cups”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, the warmth of Lilia was absent from beneath Agatha's palms, as she too claimed her reward and was whisked from The Road’s realm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned to Alice next, yet she, who was as sharp as Rio’s blade and as observant as a soldier, had already stepped forward. Her hand was gripped tightly over the scar on her shoulder with a white-knuckled hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I, Alice Wu-Gulliver have finally freed my family from the curse that has haunted and killed us for
     <i>
      centuries
     </i>
     ,” the reality of her accomplishment seemed to settle now she knew she was at the end of The Road, that freedom was so close to being within her grasp. She laughed loudly, a disbelieving, joyous sound before slapping a hand over her mouth, evidently unused to making such happy sounds. “I did it,” she grinned at Teen, beamed at Rio, and finally smiled at Agatha. “I did it,
     <i>
      I saved us
     </i>
     ”. Her eyes started to well as she looked down and caught a glimpse of the tattoo on her arm, the one her mother had insisted she get to keep her safe, or as safe as a cursed child could be. With a shaky palm she cupped her arm directly over the dark ink, “I did it mom, I broke our curse”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A joyful bout of relieved laughter echoed around the room as Alice was swept from The Road, having successfully completed its trials and tribulations.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Woah,” Teen breathed, amazed that the others had done it, that they had actually won. Immediately his brow furrowed with panic, “I don’t think anything has changed for me, nothing drastic like that! I haven’t been alive long enough to have trauma that deep!”
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time throughout this entire process Rio moved, sliding from the morgue tray looking, quite unnervingly so, like the wraith Agatha now knew her to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen watched her too, looking almost afraid as she drew closer, her heavy stare set upon his pale face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was aware they didn’t have time for whatever Rio was going to say or do, for the trial's clock was still ticking and the three of them, or the two of with mortal lives at least, only had a certain amount of time left.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t want to do it this way, she had wanted him to realise on his own. He was Wanda’s child after all, or at least partially, and he was definitely smart enough to figure it out too. Yet time was running out, and she knew from the first trial that his magic wouldn’t hesitate to kill them both, even subconsciously. So she would have to make him aware of just how The Road came to be, of just how similar to his mother he actually was.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have the power to break out of here Billy,” her voice for once, was soft, almost maternal, “to break us all out of this place”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A wave of emotions flooded his face; from confusion, to fear, then uncertainty before finally whispering a shaky, “
     <i>
      what?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled at him, allowing the full extent of her pride to shine through. For it was true, she was proud of him. Exceptionally so. She was proud of the witch he was becoming, a witch with power enough to protect himself in the most hopeless of situations. “You are as powerful as your mother Billy, you have her power running through your veins. If anyone can break us out of here, it’s you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat on the floor with an elegant huff, grabbing his wrist to tug him down to sit opposite her as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked afraid, even more so too when she clamped both of her palms around the sides of his head, pressing his curly hair flat to his skull. She stared at him imploringly, before rolling her eyes and grabbing one of his hands to direct it towards her own head, “now, sit there and close your eyes”.
    </p>
    <p>
     He did so, still looking unsure.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agatha
     </i>
     ,” Rio’s voice was closer than she had anticipated and she peeked through one eye to find Rio crouched beside them, with a mournful, regretful expression on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Undoubtedly she was mourning the opportunity to request Agatha's memories be restored at the end of The Road, and for Agatha to remember Rio and all they are to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although, with the way Agatha’s heart constricted painfully at Rio’s melancholy expression, she was almost certain she had managed to fall in love with the same witch all over again anyway. And if that wasn’t a sign that she and this woman, this beautiful immortal goddess were meant for one another, she wasn’t entirely sure what would be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shot her a broad grin, aiming for reassuringly cocky, “don’t worry sweetheart, we’ll be out of here soon enough. And when we are, we’ll find another way to get my memories back”.
    </p>
    <p>
     But all Rio did was utter her name once again, a broken whimper of a word, “
     <i>
      Agatha
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet the pulse of magic she could feel stirring beneath her palms, buzzing within the boy sat across from her distracted her from Rio's plight. A rush of power had always been something she had been drawn to, and this kid had an abundance of the stuff, just sparking and rushing beneath his skin like his arteries were filled with the arcane and not blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     She jolted slightly, feeling a spark of wayward magic bounce through her skull, sparked accidentally from one of his palms which were still pressed to either side of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s it,” she tried guiding him, hoping her voice would be a light leading him to their goal, “find the seam of this world Billy, find the seam and tear through it; take us home”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her own eyes were shut, clenched tightly, but she could picture his expression; one filled with furious determination, uncertainty in his own ability, and illuminated by blue light, the same shade that had thrown them from The Road, nearly drowning them all.
    </p>
    <p>
     She flinched then, feeling another tendril of his magic come slicing through her skull. This one however, unlike the first, didn’t travel all the way through as though she was merely an object to traverse, no, this one stopped in her mind, right at back of her skull where that awful pain always originated whenever she thought too long, or too hard about Rio and their lost, mysterious history.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Ah
     </i>
     ,” she gasped when Teen’s magic tugged, almost as though it were trying to pull a thick chain from around a closed chest, “what are you-”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her words were cut off by Billy’s voice, “I can feel something, something’s glowing in here Agatha, something
     <i>
      red
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Get out of there
     </i>
     ,” she hissed, furious that he was pursuing his own course through her mind, and not focussed on the task at hand; their escape from his damned hex.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I- I- I- can’t, I don’t know
     <i>
      how!
     </i>
     ” His panic caused a wave of fear to rush through. She had been forced to endure too many hands rifling through her thoughts recently, but these uneducated, novice ones had the power to do irrevocable damage without even meaning to.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Billy
     </i>
     ,” her words were a furious hiss, one that was cut short by a strangled gasp of pain, as once again his magic tugged stubbornly at the glowing lock in her mind, “
     <i>
      stop it!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha!” Rio’s panicked voice echoed clearly through all of the static; which was both a comfort, for it meant she was close by, but also a concern, as she had never heard Rio sound quite so fearful.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pain sharpened, becoming almost unbearable to the point she could no longer speak or try to stop him. All she could do was endure the torment of his magic poking and prodding around what was already a tender, bruised part of her psyche until within the blink of an eye, a small shockwave of electric blue energy pulsed through her mind and behind her eyelids, before Billy too, was snatched from The Road, leaving Agatha and Rio alone in the morgue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Fucking hell
     </i>
     ,” she whimpered, raising both hands to her head as it continued to pound. It felt as though Teen had taken a chainsaw to her mind, yet the consistent ticking of the timer forced her to open her eyes, to peer around and finally find Rio, who was still crouched beside her with a desperately concerned expression on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you alright?!” Rio's words were ragged with worry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha flinched back the moment Rio spoke; her voice was far too loud for Agatha's pounding head to handle. “Fuck,” she hissed again, waving a weakened hand at Rio, “I’m fine, I don’t- I don’t know what he did, but it fucking hurt”. She glanced around as the reality of it just being the two of them, and the fact the boy who had unknowingly designed the hex was now gone, finally descended on her like grave dirt upon a coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Rio whispered, as one of her hands shot forward to clutch her wrist. The sudden touch caused her to flinch again; her body still recovering from such a sudden, and quite brutal, magical intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shit!” Agatha hissed, scrabbling backwards slightly to give herself some space to process whatever changes Billy had made to her mind. She closed her eyes, trying to look inward and focus on that infected part of her brain that Wanda had taken control of over a year ago. Although in truth, the moment she tried to feel it, it felt...
     <i>
      weaker
     </i>
     . A small frisson of pain resounded out the longer she prodded at it, thinking heavily of Rio and her secrets, which only an hour ago would have caused a sharp pain to shoot through her skull, yet whatever Billy had done to it had weakened it's defences and made it's attack feel far less potent.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you alright?” Rio’s voice was urgent. She had stood up from her crouch, but didn’t come any closer, both her hands help up in a gesture universal good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kept her eyes scrunched closed and brushed both her hands back through her hair, inhaling deeply for a long moment to regain control over herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, she glanced over to Rio; the witch who she apparently knew but couldn't remember, the one who always tried to help her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” she finally breathed out, “yeah I think so”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shook her head, “Billy’s magic just got a bit intense for a hot minute,” she scoffed, feeling rather hopeless for the first time, “before he left me here to die”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s expression softened, before it hardened to an almost frightening degree, “Agatha”. Her own name was a request, one that demanded Agatha look back at her, which she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have to tell you something... about Billy,” Rio’s voice was nervous, almost shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     But whatever it was Rio wanted to say, she didn’t get a chance to, for in the very next moment the ground started to shake so violently a large crevasse appeared, zig-zagging its way through the cold tiles beneath their feet, baring the dark, damp earth below.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Shit!
     </i>
     ” She hissed, looking around for an answer, “I don’t know what I need to do to get out!”
    </p>
    <p>
     But as always, Rio was there, her pillar of calm in the storm. “
     <i>
      Think
     </i>
     ,” she intoned her voice as measured and as ordered as one would expect from an ancient, immortal deity. “Think about your trial, about the meaning of it all. What were you asked to do?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stumbled, for the room had started to shake even more violently, causing the morgue drawers surrounding them to shake and clang against the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
     She threw her hands up, gesturing towards Rio herself, “death!” She couldn’t stop herself from scoffing with dark amusement, “my trial was about
     <i>
      facing death!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Good
     </i>
     ,” Rio breathed, “Good, and here I am, all yours. So what is it about death? What do you need to understand, or accept, or claim in order to escape?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The thing is, Rio’s advice was good. It was solid, and it made sense. Agatha knew immediately the angle Rio was going for; she was aiming for Agatha to accept it, to accept Death as life's foil, to accept that Death would visit every single human to ever live and whisk them away to the great beyond. But, and it's a big but, Agatha had never
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     understood that particular concept. So that couldn’t possibly be the lesson The Road had plucked from her skull as the one that needed to be learnt.
    </p>
    <p>
     After all, Agatha knew better than most the three intrinsic rules of the universe; that life was cruel, that death was greedy, and even the most innocent of souls were merely ripe fruit to be plucked away from grieving mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, it couldn't be an
     <i>
      acceptance
     </i>
     of death that was her challenge to best. She had accepted death before, in fact she had accepted centuries ago that death had stolen her child away. As much as she might despise it, she knew it was the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that left only one other answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the one thing that Agatha had always desired, and the one thing she had always been working towards was simple. It wasn’t to accept Death, it was to
     <i>
      best
     </i>
     it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And with that realisation, lightning struck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Aah-ha!
     </i>
     ” She cried, plucking her broach from her drab, grey gown to gently pull the dandelion seed from within it's delicate casing. She knew it was there, had kept it safely tucked away beneath the lock of Nicky’s hair as another reminder of her darling boy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes widened at her sudden shout of victory, before her brow furrowed the moment Agatha dropped to her knees to start scraping a small gouge into the soil that the room's quake had created.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Er...?” Rio droned, “I'm not sure you can dig your way out of this one. It’s probably easier to just accept it. Accept
     <i>
      me
     </i>
     Agatha and The Road will let you go”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grinned up at her wolfishly, feeling that familiar confidence burning in her blood from being one of the smartest people on the damn planet. “Oh honey,” Agatha drawled, before pressing a kiss to the small seed she still had pinched between her thumb and forefinger, “my trial wasn’t about
     <i>
      accepting
     </i>
     death”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It wasn’t?” Rio’s eyebrows shot up in disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Of course not
     </i>
     . The point of the trial was to highlight the one thing we each wanted above everything else - Jen wanted her powers, Alice wanted to break her family’s curse, Lilia wanted her timeline straightened out, and Teen wanted to discover himself, to learn the truth about who he is”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio crouched beside her again, watching intently as Agatha gently pressed the dandelion seed into the soil. Agatha closed her eyes, drawing thoughts of her son to the forefront of her mind, thoughts of the one person she would trade the whole world for, bringing tears to her eyes with ease; they were never far away when thoughts of Nicky lingered on her consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright,” Rio said, going along with Agatha’s explanation, even if she wasn’t entirely sold, “and what is it you want beyond anything else?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned down to blink a few of the tears pooling on her lashes onto the soil, right atop the seed she had kept to remember her son, now watered with tears she had wept for him. After, she looked up at Rio, this stranger with a face that mirrored her child's, a stranger sat here in the dark robes of her dark duty, and grinned at her like a wolf baring it’s teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “To
     <i>
      beat
     </i>
     you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And with that truth exposed to the open air, the seed took root. The two of them watched in awed silence as life grew from nothing, from a world, as Agatha had exclaimed when Jen had first pointed out the grow lights shining above them, that this was a place without earth or water. And yet, here she was, scraping through the floor to reach soil, planting a seed that is centuries old and watered by the outpouring of grief from her own body.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dandelion started to grow at an expeditious rate, cycling from a small green stalk to a bloom of fluffy yellow, before shrinking into a multitude of seeds that then withered and died.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had done it, she had born life from nothing and beaten the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
     A loud clunking sound echoed from behind her exposing the stairway out, just as the room started to shake and chunks of dirt started to fall from the ceiling, falling into her eyes and mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah, shit!” She cried, “the others get zapped out of here, but
     <i>
      oh no
     </i>
     lets drown Agatha in the fucking dirt,” she grumbled, grabbing hold of Rio’s hand to drag her up the staircase towards the exit.
    </p>
    <p>
     The closed exit.
    </p>
    <p>
     The exit that she couldn’t fucking use because it was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Releasing Rio’s wrist, she started to bang both of her hands on the metal door in front of her, “
     <i>
      hey!
     </i>
     I did it, I beat your trial!
     <i>
      Let me out!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agatha
     </i>
     ,” Rio said, her voice full of warning for everything happening behind them, which by the level of rumbling occurring down the short stairwell, she could tell wasn’t good.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gave the door one more shove and it finally loosened, leading up from Agnes’s basement, to Agnes’s garden, where she found Jen, Lilia, Alice, and Teen huddled together, heads bowed low, talking urgently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do we get back though?!” Alice was asking, tone solemn and serious, “we can’t just leave them there to die”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen sighed, “I know she wouldn’t hesitate to leave any of us, but,
     <i>
      ugh
     </i>
     ,” she threw her hands up petulantly, “I don’t think we should leave her to die either”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia smirked, looking past them all to Agatha who had come to a stop behind the others, where they couldn't see her unless they were to turn around. “I told you,” Lilia said knowingly, “the world isn’t rid of Agatha Harkness or her reign of chaos just yet”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Damn straight,” Agatha drawled loudly, prompting all of the others to spin around in surprise. It was amusing to compare their mix of reactions to her sudden appearance and survival of The Road, which ranged from a thrilled '
     <i>
      Agatha!
     </i>
     ' from Teen, to a dry '
     <i>
      oh, you’re not dead
     </i>
     ' from Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice’s reaction was probably the sweetest though, which consisted of a broad grin and a hard slap to the shoulder, “Fuckin knew you’d make it Harkness. Bad bitch like you wasn’t dying today, hell no”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled at her, a genuine one too, which surprised Agatha just as much as it surprised Alice, whose jaw dropped in shock. It made Agatha pout slightly immediately after, for the the sensation of directing a warm smile at anyone other than her child, or her green witch was a strange one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thoughts of green witches focussed her mind once more, prompting Agatha start looking around for a glimpse of dark robes and darker eyes. She felt certain Rio had been directly behind her whilst fleeing the collapsing basement after all, so wasn’t sure where she had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where’s Rio?” Agatha asked, feeling a measure of fear rush through her at the thought of her being trapped on The Road all alone. Even though, she knew logically that it was an absurd thought, that Rio couldn’t be trapped
     <i>
      anywhere
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “She was with you wasn’t she?” Alice asked, also starting to look toward the dark corners of Agnes’s garden, hoping to catch a glimpse of their wayward coven-mate.
    </p>
    <p>
     “When she screams ‘
     <i>
      duck, I want the whole set
     </i>
     ’, hit the deck,” Lilia’s urgent voice sounded from behind them, drawing Agatha’s attention, along with everyone else’s back onto the older witch. Lilia’s eyes were closed, and she was shaking her head slightly, as they had learned she did whenever returning from one of her timeline-mix-up episodes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, still looking around for Rio whose disappearance she was finding alarming for a number of reasons, “I want the whole
     <i>
      set?
     </i>
     ” She repeated, tone mocking, “what the hell is that supposed to mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly a flare of green light streaked through the sky, coalescing on the roof in a blur of dark emerald and smoky black.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Found her,” Jen said, voice and face both blank and lacking inflection; now entirely unphased by Rio’s penchant for dramatic entrances.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned with a display of eagerness she would have found embarrassing if she had been aware she had done so. And the moment her eyes landed on Rio, who was straddling the roof in her dark robes, looking as devilish as she did dangerous, Agatha felt her mouth go dry for wanting her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Hi honey
     </i>
     ,” she couldn’t stop herself from drawling lasciviously, smirking up at Rio who smiled back, although it wasn’t the beaming, feral grin she had been expecting, but a far more reserved expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t get a moment to ponder it though, for in the very next instant Rio grit her teeth like a mother wolf might at another beast threatening her pack, and held a clawed hand out, before bellowing at them all through a deranged cackle, “duck! I want the whole set!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen and Agatha turned to each other, their eyes wide as they both recalled Lilia’s earlier warning before promptly throwing themselves at the others, pushing them to the ground just as Agnes’s kitchen sink came crashing through the side of the house, directly towards the patch of grass they had all been standing only moments before.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Rio!
     </i>
     ” Agatha scolded, “the rest of us aren’t fucking immor-” yet she was silenced quickly, because as the sink went soaring over their heads, she saw it hit it's
     <i>
      actual
     </i>
     target moments later; which happened to be one of the Salem Seven, who had been creeping up behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh,” Agatha breathed, nodding to herself, “
     <i>
      the set
     </i>
     that makes sense now,” finally understanding Rio’s meaning, she scrabbled back to her feet, hauling Lilia up too as she went. Rio wanted the Salem Seven, and she wanted them dead.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, if Agatha was not mistaken, by the laws of nature Rio herself couldn’t kill them. So, logically the next step was to hurl a kitchen sink at them to buy the rest of the coven more time to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Lilia! Watch out!
     </i>
     ” Alice cried, as a burst of power was sent towards their small group from the direction the kitchen sink had gone sailing. The Salemite was back on her feet and hissing at them from the shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now one Salem Seven member was eery enough, but not particularly intimidating, however the moment the other three remaining Salemites stepped out of the shadows, each of their brown, rotten teeth bared like the animals they resembled so closely, Agatha felt a thrill of fear run up her spine. Especially, as she was still without an ounce of magic.
    </p>
    <p>
     An assessing pause caused everyone to freeze, as her coven sized up the remaining four members of the Salem Seven, and the Salemites did the same in return. And then, as though someone had simply flipped a switch or struck a match, everyone threw themselves into the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did her best dodging and diving rogue streaks of magic and she caught a few impressive glimpses of her coven fighting as she army crawled for cover. In truth, she hadn't considered any of the other women particularly good fighters, having assumed they would suck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, she admitted her initial assumptions were wrong the moment she saw Alice use a burst of yellow energy to strip the sister known as crow of all her feathers, forcing her to return to her human form.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or when Lilia used her powers of prediction to accurately guess from where and when the next bolt of magic was going to be sent her way, transporting herself with ease out of it’s range.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even Jen, who hadn’t been able to use her powers for one hundred years was evidently enjoying the opportunity to flex them properly, using her pink magic as though it was a lasso and throwing it around the throat of one of the Salemites to drag her backwards, as she scrabbled at her throat with desperate fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen was the only one who appeared frightened, having found an upturned piece of garden furniture to use as a makeshift shield. And although she scoffed at him, she was also jealous that he had found such decent cover before she did, a point she found even more unfair due to the fact she was currently entirely powerless, and he powerful enough to
     <i>
      create
     </i>
     The Road that had nearly killed them all
     <i>
      by accident
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Scooch over!
     </i>
     ” She shouted to him over the bellow of the battle going on behind her. However, just before she managed to crawl behind the garden table too, she felt sharp nails piercing the skin of her ankle and tug her backwards from her crawl, causing her to land painfully on her stomach and smack her jaw off the hard ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     Scrabbling with desperate fingers, Agatha managed to turn enough to see one of the Salem Seven, the one with cicadas crawling all over her body and out of her gaping mouth lying flat on her front, and dragging Agatha back towards her with a feral intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried kicking free, but the Salemite had utilised her magic to make her grip unbreakable. Agatha hated herself for it, but she did in fact scream in terror in that moment, for the realisation she was powerless against a witch who wanted her dead had settled into her stomach like a boulder in a pond.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet once again, Billy was unable to resist the Avenger blood burning in his veins, and quickly jumped up from behind the table with a desperate cry of “
     <i>
      no!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     The Salemite didn’t listen to him, of course, and Agatha’s eyes met his as she was being dragged backwards. He looked panicked, unsure of what to do before his face evened out with determination and most alarmingly of all,
     <i>
      trust
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t take it all,” was all he said before doing something every other witch on the planet wouldn’t ever dream of, he threw a beam of his electric blue power directly at her chest, allowing her starving body to feed off of his magic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes closed with the euphoria of the moment, now completely unphased by the scrabbling nails on her ankle as her body did what it had always done and started to gulp greedily at the power source it had been exposed to.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Oh my
     </i>
     ,” she sighed, “it feels
     <i>
      so
     </i>
     good!” The power lifted her upward, out of reach of the Salemite who had been holding her ankle captive. The combined power also did an excellent job of shielding her from any wayward arcane attacks, for the flow of magic from him to her was far too strong to be penetrated by a rogue strike of measly Salemite energy.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could feel it sparking down every vein and artery, flashing inside every cell like a number of grenades going off, each one rearming her body with the magic it had always naturally possessed, reclaiming the power that had been ripped from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Billy’s blue turned into Agatha’s purple, she felt a pulsing pressure start to build in her mind, a similar sensation to the one she had experienced in the final trial when Billy’s magic had been poking and prodding at Wanda’s hex, the one holding all of her memories back. Only this time, it was her own magic pouring through her consciousness, as though her purple was the arcane equivalent of a white blood cell, bringing the fight to the infection Wanda had left inside her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as she broke the connection of magic between herself and Teen, not desiring or willing to kill him, she felt those final shaky chains of scarlet shatter under the onslaught of her power, dissolving into nothing at all, like a wisp of smoke swept away by an ocean gale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Much to her curiosity nothing changed immediately, even though any remnants of Wanda had been wiped from her mind like a damp cloth across a dusty table. She didn’t get an overwhelming resurgence of memories of Rio from across the centuries, she didn’t suddenly have all the answers to every question she had been puzzling over since returning to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead it was eerily blank, quiet almost. Disturbingly so. And she couldn’t help but doubt what she had been told. Had Rio been honest? Did they actually know each other, or was the history Rio spoke of a falsification?
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t even get an opportunity to ponder or worry over it anymore than that, because in the time it took for her to inhale once, settling into the familiar sensation of magic sparking under her skin once more, she felt a ripple of power heading straight towards her, sent upwards from the witch on the floor who had been scratching at her ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah yes,” she drawled, grinning down at the witch she was about to murder like a shark might leer at a passing seal, “
     <i>
      you
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Salemite’s fear was only evidenced by the slight widening of her eyes behind her mask. After all, Agatha’s reputation had always preceded her, and if there was one thing she enjoyed it was killing witches, and if there was one other thing that she really,
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     enjoyed, it was killing witches who had pissed her off.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she got to work straight away, cackling with glee the entire time, relishing the opportunity to use her magic once more, to feel her purple swirling inside her chest and immediately doing as she bid it with a mere flick of her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her first victim, obviously, was the witch who had dared scrabble at her ankles like a rodent. That particular witch was dealt with quickly by a swift blow to the head from a powerful strike of magic from above, like a bolt of lightning through the top of her head that pinned her slumped form to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     Prowling forward through the ongoing carnage she focussed on the Salemite Lilia was currently dodging with her powers of foresight. It was the perfect opportunity to gain even more power, so with very little concern or fear for her own safety, she sent a spark of electricity straight into the Salemite's skull, zapping her enough to get her attention. The witch responded as Agatha desired her to, turning with her teeth bared like the animal she was, before sprinting full pelt at Agatha with a wild scream.
    </p>
    <p>
     Needing her angry, and hungering for more magic, Agatha did was she did best; she provoked a reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Ha!
     </i>
     ” She barked nastily, “you’re mother made a similar noise when I drained her dry. Most disgusting magic I’ve ever had the displeasure of tasting, mind you. I should have saved myself the endurance of it and simply slit her throat instead”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her words had their intended affect and the Salemite threw out a powerful burst of magic, aiming for Agatha’s heart which she then allowed to strike her. In a single, heady gulp her magic tugged and less than thirty seconds later the Salemite's desiccated corpse dropped to the grass with an empty thump.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused momentarily, glancing around the battle scene to locate her next target, taking brief stock of the fact Rio had slid from the roof to the ground and was now in the process of harvesting the fallen Salemite’s souls which she was…
     <i>
      putting in an old jar?
     </i>
     A jar that already had four glowing orbs buzzing around inside of it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Huh
     </i>
     . It was interesting to watch her work, because Agatha was about ninety percent certain that Rio’s actions weren’t typical for harvesting the souls of the recently deceased.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t get time to consider it beyond that, as the remaining two sisters of the Salem Seven coven had finally stopped trying to kill Alice and Jen, and had instead turned their attention onto their actual target, the target they had just watched murder two of their coven-mates without hesitation or mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s delighted cackle rang out amongst the quiet suburban street of Westview. She felt truly euphoric, and not only at having her magic back, but at surviving The Road, at knowing that Wanda’s presence in her mind had finally been slain like a roaring scarlet dragon pierced through the heart with a silver sword. And of course, to at long last be putting an end to the Salem Seven’s never-ending pursuit of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two feral women circled her, as all of her own coven started to back off to watch the show from the edges of the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Come on ladies!
     </i>
     ,” Agatha crowed at them mockingly, “let’s see if we can finally avenge the mummy dearest's shall we”. She crossed her arms, appearing relaxed even as they started to crawl closer, wild down to their last cell. Their hissing had increased in pitch though, so she knew they could understand her taunting. “I mean, how long has it been since I murdered those dumb bitches? Three hundred years? And you
     <i>
      still
     </i>
     haven't been able to take me out?” She started to count on her fingers, “so the
     <i>
      seven
     </i>
     of you, couldn’t kill the
     <i>
      one
     </i>
     of me, over
     <i>
      three hundred years?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     She whistled, “those stats don’t look great guys, I’ll be honest. So, you can probably be assured that both of your mothers…,” she hardened her voice as she geared up for the final blow, “…who squealed like pigs when I sucked the life out of them, will be
     <i>
      rolling
     </i>
     in their graves, disgusted and horrified at the
     <i>
      sad
     </i>
     ,
     <i>
      pathetic
     </i>
     ,
     <i>
      embarrassing
     </i>
     job their daughters have done to avenge their death’s”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her words did as she had designed them too, and within seconds the final two members of the Salem Seven fell victim to their own angry grief, and shot powerful beams of magic directly at Agatha’s chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a delighted, satisfied sigh she closed her eyes and gulped up every drop of power they possessed, enjoying it the same way she would enjoy an excellent meal. So distracted by the pleasure of it all, she only knew that they were dead by two resounding thumps hitting the floor moments apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Taking a moment, she rolled her shoulders and stretched her neck, sighing with fulfilment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck, did it feel good to be back.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was only then that she remembered she actually had a coven now. One she didn't, or at least probably didn't, intend to kill.
    </p>
    <p>
     She grinned at them all, a wild, feral expression feeling for all intents and purposes like a cat that had brought it’s owner a mauled bird as a gift, a cat that then stared at the bloody mess on the carpet with bright eyes, as if to say ‘
     <i>
      I did this for you, aren’t you proud of me. Look how well I can murder things
     </i>
     ’.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their reactions were, to be fair, not quite as terrible as she had imagined they might be after watching her slaughter four women.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen wore an expression of disdain marred with an undercurrent of acceptance, as if Agatha had done precisely what she had expected, but she wasn’t entirely mad about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was wide-eyed, staring down at the desiccated bodies with a morbid fascination, although Agatha was delighted to see very little fear or judgement in her face, only curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     On first glance Lilia looked bored, which took Agatha by surprise initially. But then, after narrowing her gaze to study her expression further it was clear she was in the midst of another flash through time and wasn’t actually with them at this given moment, as she was once more lost within the maze of her own timeline.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen’s reaction was mixed, as though not entirely sure what emotion to land on. He started with fatigued, obviously still recovering from the mass of power Agatha had eked from him, then thrilled that their enemies were dead, then horrified with himself for feeling thrilled that their enemies were dead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Honestly, that kid’s moral compass was as unstable as his mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quite promptly however, she was distracted from any further review of her coven by a voice, a voice that caused that closed cell within her mind, the cell that had been locked tight and secured by Wanda’s chains of scarlet power, power that was now entirely gone, to creak open with a rusty squeak.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?” Rio said from behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, on hearing her voice Agatha flinched, as suddenly what felt like a thousand other words spoken across time echoed through her mind all at once; a constant hubbub of murmuring, muttering, whispering, and screaming as memories started to pour in, all of them of Rio, moments that then echoed through her mind as a rush of memories, a couple of centuries worth even, started to slam into her consciousness, one after the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having witnessed Agatha’s startling reaction to her voice, Rio stepped closer. A concerned frown carving a groove between her eyebrows as she grasped hold of Agatha’s wrists, hoping to help keep her steady and standing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, Rio’s touch inspired the same result as her voice, summoning forth a thousand ghostly imprints of Rio’s hands from across time to brush across Agatha’s skin; soft touches, gentle caresses, furious grapples, and lust-filled gripping all suddenly started to haunt her flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio jerked away, fearful that her touch was causing Agatha pain the moment she cried out and hunched forward, eyes clenched tightly together as each gap within her mind that Rio had been erased from, was returned to its original setting, like Rio was a blurred figure being brought into sharp clarity on an abundance of photographs, all at the same time. And a once hidden face was rediscovered until those dark eyes and those plump lips became as familiar and as dear as they always had been.
    </p>
    <p>
     And at long last, after knowing in her very bones that something important, something truly integral had been taken from her this entire time, she got it back, in its entirety.
    </p>
    <p>
     It all washed over her in chronological order, like their love story was playing on a loop in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could remember the first time they had met, eyes meeting over the corpse of a dead Salemite; Agatha’s gaze hungry for the beautiful stranger, Rio’s wide with all that separated her from humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could recall their blossoming love, how Agatha had pursued Rio relentlessly, presenting coven after coven, witch after witch at Rio’s alter, until Rio had given in to the new flames of desire that she was experiencing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She remembered their wedding, of the two of them joyously exclaiming their love for one another beneath a full moon in the ways of old, with a blood seal and the incantation to bond two souls together.
    </p>
    <p>
     She remembered Nicky, of how every part of him was a reflection of his other mother. His dimples, his smirk, his hair, his eyes. She remembered the moment they discovered Agatha was pregnant, of her flight from their home, of her fear for her son, of Rio’s desperate expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then finally, she remembered the moments everything had fallen apart; giving birth beneath a dark canopy and begging Rio not to take their child from her. Of waking alone seven years later to that same child laying beside her, as cold and as still as ice.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then the final few puzzle pieces, far newer than any of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     Memories of Rio finding her in Westview after hiding from her for one hundred years, of Rio’s anguished expression as she sliced an escape into the wall of Agnes's living room, promising to return even after Agatha had pushed her away again. All of it finally slid back into place, leaving only smoke after a fire and the mental equivalent of lactic acid burning through her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gasped desperately for air, as though she had been being held under water this entire time and had only now been allowed to return to the surface to breathe. Her eyes shot open and she stared at Rio, finally understanding precisely
     <i>
      who
     </i>
     this witch was to her, and
     <i>
      why
     </i>
     , after
     <i>
      everything
     </i>
     , all she had wanted to do, even with half of her memories locked away, was to be as close to Rio as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was staring back at her, eyes wide with concern for whatever was happening within Agatha’s mind, yet the moment their eyes met it was clear Rio could sense the weight of their history in Agatha's gaze. Perhaps her eyes once again possessed a sharpness that the Agatha without the full extent of her grief or anger didn't know how to wield.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a single step closer, eyes glistening with fresh tears and flickering hope that her theory was true, that Agatha, once again, knew exactly who she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?” Her voice was timid, a fearful gasp, “do- do you know who I am?”
    </p>
    <p>
     And on hearing the depth of Rio’s grief, Agatha could do little more than nod desperately, her own eyes welling with tears against her will, as the realisation of what exactly had been done to her settled into her tired bones, and then deeper still to rest in that grief filled part of her that every trauma she had ever experienced resided, a graveyard of past hurts and maltreatment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was finding it hard to breathe, and she was finding it impossible to drag her eyes away from her wife, who looked close to collapsing from relief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      You- you know me?
     </i>
     ” Rio asked again, needing reassurance that she wasn’t misunderstanding Agatha’s gesture, “you remember
     <i>
      everything?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha couldn’t answer her question directly, now far too distracted by the heavy weight of what Wanda had done to her. She stumbled closer on unsteady feet, grasping Rio’s forearms beneath her hands, relishing the warmth of her body, the softness of her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She took
     <i>
      you
     </i>
     from me?” Agatha’s voice was a bereft whisper, “she
     <i>
      stole
     </i>
     you from me? She stole
     <i>
      us?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gasped on a sob, her relief at Agatha being whole once more almost physical as she dropped forward, all of her weight collapsing into Agatha as though she could finally take a moment to rest now she was herself again, “she did, she tore me from your head like a rogue weed”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh
     <i>
      sweetheart
     </i>
     ,” Agatha gasped through her tears, truly and fundamentally astounded at the level of devastation Wanda had wrought in her life. Having not only trapped Agatha behind the façade of Agnes, but to shroud all of the way’s Rio’s roots were twisted into her own was heinous and she felt a sharp, hungry flare of anger at the injustice of the Scarlet Witch's actions.
    </p>
    <p>
     She ran her hands up Rio’s arms to cradle her jaw, tilting her head down so she could press desperate lips to her forehead, before then pressing even more kisses against every inch of Rio’s face that she could reach; her temple, her cheekbone, her jaw, the side of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shuddered into Agatha’s kisses, clawing desperately at her back to haul her closer, to press herself against the length of Agatha’s body and bask in the warmth of her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was an astoundingly difficult thing to comprehend and come to terms with.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not just because she has always been desperately in love with her wife, a realisation she had come to accept throughout their time together in Westview, but also because all of her anger, anger that was entirely valid, over what Rio had done to them all those years ago, what she had done to Agatha, what she had done to their child, was now alive and roiling in her gut like an angry, furious beast.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of the memories had come streaming in so quickly and so intensely, that so much of what she had experienced from across the centuries, both good and bad felt far more raw, and far more recent than it had before Wanda had locked those memories away inside her own consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Which left her at a difficult crossroads.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because not only had her love for Rio been bolstered through recalling so vividly and quickly all of the moments they had shared from before Nicky was born. But also, all of her anger was sitting just below the surface too, freshly stoked and prodding at her grief like a brutish child might poke at an ant’s nest.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that was before she even considered every new memory she had created with Rio since then, because now she had all of her post-amnesia memories floating through her mind too.
    </p>
    <p>
     For she had, unknowingly, provided herself with everything she had been trying to avoid whilst under the shroud of the Darkhold, which was yet even more evidence and proof as to why Rio truly was, and always will be, the love of her fucking life.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now, like new and improved software gifting her with a slideshow of intimate moments downloaded directly into her mind, she had an abundance of them. Of new memories, not at all tarnished by her own grief and pain, but rather memories that were and are entirely Rio, and all of the reasons she loved her so damn much.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of Rio fighting Wanda so desperately, of the crumpled flowers she had been holding on her return to Agatha, as she had promised to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of Rio throughout her time as Agnes, protective and attentive but unwilling to take advantage of Agatha’s lack of autonomy, all the while being as gentle as ever with the version of Agatha that was Agnes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of Rio trying again, and again, and again, to break her free from Wanda's curse. Of her joining Agatha in every single one of her mad fantasies, of never giving up the fight for Agatha and her freedom, even if it meant they would return to a dynamic Agatha knew, and had always known, hurt Rio the most.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of Rio on The Road, helping her, protecting her, denying her too, because she knew a completely lucid Agatha would have an entirely different perspective on any intimacy they might share.
    </p>
    <p>
     And finally of Rio now, breaking in her arms after bearing the weight of Agatha’s welfare for the past twelve months, at the detriment of the dead and the dying, and ultimately her own broken heart too.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” Agatha whispered, drawing back only slightly as she failed as she always did at offering comfort, “I- don’t-“. She didn’t know what to say, still reeling herself from having three-hundred-and-fifty years’ worth of memories stuffed back into her consciousness, amidst the overwhelming realisation of just how devoted her wife was to her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaner in close again and cradled Rio’s jaw with her palms, gently pulling her face upwards. She allowed her eyes to flicker over Rio’s features, features that only an hour ago had been appealing and familiar but didn’t hold any of the history her current examination did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared back, her eyes wide and urgent, yet almost shielded, like a dog who was wary of an unpredictable owner, hoping desperately for love but expecting a strike.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, with the right words absent from both her throat and mind, Agatha did the only thing she could think to do. And admittedly, the only thing she wanted to do too. She leaned in even closer and covered Rio’s mouth with her own, claiming her lips with an intensity that shocked both of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio yielded instantly, arching into Agatha like a flower would lean toward the sun, until, much to Agatha’s surprise Rio pulled away with a sharp jerk of her head. Agatha drew back too, unsure what had perturbed Rio so, only to find her looking, even more bizarrely, far more overwrought than she had before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bowed her head, her shoulders slumping and shaking as though she were crying. Panicked at Rio’s reaction, Agatha cradled her jaw and tried to pull her face upwards again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it? What’s wrong sweetheart? I’m here, I’m back,” she tried to reassure her softly, “I remember everything, all of it. I remember before Wanda, I remember the hex, and I remember every moment after, when you looked after me so well”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t control her own softness, entirely overtaken by her need to soothe Rio’s despair. Despair that she didn’t entirely understand however, considering Agatha was whole once more and they were standing together, embracing, which was at least as far as Agatha knew, all Rio had wanted for the span of several lifetimes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know,” Rio sighed, finally opening her eyes to stare into Agatha’s with unmitigated devastation, “but I have to tell you something”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha frowned, not expecting any sort of confession from her, “what is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked beyond Agatha then, over her shoulder towards where the others were stood in a small circle of their own, laughing and recounting The Road they had just walked and the battle they had just won.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes as though bracing herself for what she was about to say, before they snapped open again, now with a firm, determined glint sparking in their depths, even through the sheen of her unspent tears, “Billy is Wanda’s child”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled with relief, as she felt her shoulders relax in response to Rio’s words. If
     <i>
      this
     </i>
     was the grand reveal, Rio didn’t need to worry. Agatha had figured that out days ago. But before she could say anything, Rio continued to speak, her voice as solemn as a funeral knell.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Or at least the soul of Wanda’s child has claimed the body of William Kaplan, a boy who died a year ago. A boy whose body is owed to the universe”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha frowned at Rio’s words, her sharp mind moving the pieces into place quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet once again, before Agatha could say anything, Rio clarified her point, making her intention crystal clear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “He is an abomination, and he is disrupting the sacred balance. I have to take him”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The weight of what Rio was implying and the reality of what she was going to do settled on Agatha like the weight of an avalanche after an earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No…
     <i>
      No!
     </i>
     It cannot be!” She could hear the panic in her own voice, as thoughts of Billy spun through her mind; of the waste of power, of the waste of youth, of the waste of sheer fucking goodness; something this planet was in dire need of.
    </p>
    <p>
     And finally of how much Billy reminded her of another boy, another boy whose youth was stolen from him, who was pure, and good, and
     <i>
      kind
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a stumbling step away from Rio, breaking their embrace as all of that anger, anger that still felt painfully new from her memories recent restoration in her mind, started to pour toward the surface of her skin, branding her with the heat of her fury.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded slowly, as though she was merely a messenger and not the decider of these things, “it must be”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And like a robot pre-programmed to say the lines of a script, one written three hundred years ago beneath the weighty boughs of dark evergreen’s, Agatha started begging, “
     <i>
      please
     </i>
     let him live. Please my love!
     <i>
      Please!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sagged upon hearing Agatha’s pleading, just as Agatha gasped and clenched her eyes tightly together. For upon the completion of her final ‘
     <i>
      please
     </i>
     ’ memories of her own son started to blossom behind her eyelids like poppies opening under the weight of morning dew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Memories of Nicky smiling at her after waking from a nap, his head resting in her lap; of Nicky stood on a barrel and singing his small heart out, her maternal pride glowing golden in her heart; of Nicky coughing, a child so sickly Death was always stalking him.
    </p>
    <p>
     A child
     <i>
      Death
     </i>
     was always stalking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Death: the
     <i>
      witch
     </i>
     stood in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The witch stood in front of her:
     <i>
      her wife, Rio
     </i>
     , who she was still irrecoverably, desperately, painfully in love with.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her wife, Rio: who was planning on taking a child from her.

     <p>
      Yoooooo, we made it guys! The penultimate chapter is here!
     </p>
     <p>
      I thought that last one was long, yet this ones even longer! So brace yourselves for a bit of a marathon-read squad.
     </p>

     <b>
      RIO
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The bolt of purple magic that struck her in the sternum wasn’t much of a surprise, nor did it hurt all that badly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not in the physical sense, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
     She should have predicted it really. She should have known that an Agatha reeling from countless realisations since having her memories force themselves back into her consciousness would react like a scared dog; growling and snapping at the closest hand, which in this case, and most of them throughout time, was Rio. And even as she was thrown backwards to land in a heap of dark robes on the dew-kissed grass, she knew
     <i>
      why
     </i>
     her wife had thrown a bolt of magic at her, she understood the how and the what of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, she would take the physical pain of Agatha's magic over the emotional torment of knowing she was going to lose her again, or more patently, had already lost her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     For it was true and it was happening; the ultimate cosmic joke was already in motion. The ruinous jest of successfully transforming Rio into Sisyphus, and Agatha the relentless boulder she was never close enough or strong enough to prevent rolling away, out of her reach time and time again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio allowed herself a minute to simply feel it as she lay on the grass, to draw that aching, familiar weight across her shoulders; one she had worn since their child’s life was snuffed out and she had been forced to collect him, to guide him home. It was the weight of her love for her wife, which grew all the more heavy the longer she existed in a world in which Agatha didn’t want her anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
     A world she had been so close to banishing. A world that for a few short months had been shielded from view by Agatha’s love, which had once more been unfettered and as clear as the sun on a cloudless day, fuelling a spark of hope to dance within her blackened heart at the chance of reconcilement.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then once she had let those dark, familiar feelings root down into the core of her soul, she did as she always did when facing the reality of Agatha's hatred. She wrapped her duty around her shoulders and used it as a shield to guard her from every human reaction she was so close to losing herself to. Which at this point, primarily consisted of falling to her knees and screaming with the injustice of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     On steady feet she hauled herself up to standing. She glanced around warily for a brief moment, searching the expressions of the other coven members. For she was sure they wouldn’t hesitate to throw their own beams of arcane energy her way the moment they too learned what Rio was planning to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was clear they still didn’t know though, for all of their faces had dropped with expressions of shock, not disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second bolt of purple light struck her in the chest and this time it stung; the equivalent of a bee sting, or so she had been led to believe. Being Death had it’s perks after all, and not really suffering physical pain was one of them, even if her battered heart hadn’t yet received that particular memo from the universe, for it continued to scream at her from it's prison beneath her ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, Agatha’s strike, which was entirely fuelled by her grief and rage, not to mention powered by the first rush of magic she had tasted in a year, was as powerful as ever, throwing Rio backwards to land on the same patch of grass as before, only this time flattened from her previous landing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Fight back!
     </i>
     ” Agatha thundered from across the yard, her fury causing magic to spark around her figure, illuminating the dark garden with streaks of purple light.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swiped the back of her hand over her bleeding lip; the result of her front tooth slicing through soft skin the moment she made impact with the ground, and hauled herself back to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was staring at her, her face flooding with a mix of emotions like the ebb and flow of the tide: her anger at what Rio was planning to do; her grief at being in this position
     <i>
      again
     </i>
     , of caring so much for a child who was fated to die; her evident guilt for making Rio bleed, for throwing her magic at her as though Rio was little more than an errant fly; and finally, and most painfully of all, her love for Rio too, beaming back at her from those stormy eyes, as though Rio was to blame for it all, as though Rio had chosen this fate for herself and damned them both for the sheer the hell of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Damn you, fight back!
     </i>
     ” Agatha roared as Rio simply stood there, waiting for her to work herself past this rush of anger so she could try and explain to the others, and most importantly of all, Billy, what needed to happen and why.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Rio said, voice quiet and sure. She would allow Agatha this moment, this burst of temper that she needed to release. It would make it all a lot easier after all, for she would burn herself out eventually.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked as shocked by Rio’s refusal to fight than if she had turned around and sent an entire tempest toward her, screaming furiously and ripping tiles from roofs. Her jaw dropped, and her eyes glistened as the love beating in her heart for Rio, the love Rio knew existed because she could feel it in the heat of Agatha’s anger, started to roil with anguish. She tempered it quickly though, forcing her lip to curl back with disdain instead, as Agatha once again sent a bolt of purple fire screaming towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although it certainly said a lot, or at least it did to Rio’s poor hopeful heart, that this particular shot fell short and struck the soil at her feet, scorching the grass to blackened blades.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Fucking fight me!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Rio said again, squaring her jaw determinedly as she turned away from Agatha to sweep closer to the gaggle of witches still watching them with slack-jawed surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Billy,” Rio murmured, causing him to turn to her with wide, curious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      No!
     </i>
     You stay away from him!” Agatha’s voice came from just behind her; shrill, desperate, and furiously heartbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes, breathing deeply to keep herself calm, to focus on the job at hand, and to continue pushing on as her duty and the sacred balance demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Billy,” she said again, with an apologetic edge to both her expression and tone, “you need to come with me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She watched his shock morph into confusion, “come with you? To where?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is going on?” Jen asked, sweeping forward to stand beside Billy and place a protective hand on his arm. She turned toward Lilia and Alice, silently requesting support for her bid for answers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice stepped forward too. Her hands were in her pockets, and she looked calm, but it was clear to see her senses were on high alert and she was primed to act if required. “Yea guys,” she said, voice as deceptively calm as her exterior, “what the hell’s got the pair of you so wrung out?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia however was once again out of it, her eyes vacant and lips drooping slightly as she journeyed through time, filling in the gaps of her own knowledge, stealing secrets from the past and hindsight from the future.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deciding it would be easier to address Billy directly and ignore the others, Rio held out a hand, “Billy, you know as well as I do what this is about”. She smiled at him, hoping her expression was one of gentle acceptance and not the wild, feral grin that so often fell across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     He shook his head, appearing confused until the truth of Rio’s words started to dawn on him. He paled and brought a shaky hand up to run through his hair, “I- I don’t- you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
     However, before she could respond with words of reassurance or anything resembling an explanation, she was once again swept off her feet, only this time it wasn’t by magic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had tackled her away from Teen. Probably, Rio thought as she flew through the air, out of both frustration over being ignored, and her need to protect yet another young soul from Rio’s deathly grasp, putting up the fight she was never given the chance to when it came to their own child.
    </p>
    <p>
     They landed in a heap of robes and hair, rolling several times until they skidded to a halt with Agatha pinning Rio beneath her, as a snarl curled her lip up into something furious and wild.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I said
     <i>
      no
     </i>
     ,” she hissed, lowering her face to Rio’s until they were a breath’s width apart, “no. You
     <i>
      can’t
     </i>
     have him, you
     <i>
      can’t
     </i>
     take him. Not this time,
     <i>
      not again
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed once more, feeling the weight of everything pressing down on her. It made her feel like all of the physicality she had gained and once adored through possessing a body was beginning to crush her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have to. The threads of the universe will unravel if I don’t. You’ll curse everyone,
     <i>
      including
     </i>
     him, to a far worse fate if I don’t take him with me," she said tiredly, trying to appeal to Agatha with reason. But she should have known better; Agatha Harkness is many things, but reasonable has never been one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The world can fucking
     <i>
      burn
     </i>
     , for all I care,” she growled, “I won’t let you take him”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha!” Jen cried, storming over to try and push her off of Rio, “can someone explain what the fuck is going on please? I feel like I have whiplash”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha refused to be moved though, tightening her grip on Rio’s wrists until her nails dug into her flesh and tensing her thighs on Rio’s hips, like a cowboy might on a bucking horse, determined to not be thrown from their saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn’t until Billy, as quiet and as fearful as a mouse facing down a lion, took a few steps closer and sunk to his knees beside them that Agatha's grip waivered slightly. Rio turned her head to face him, still pinned beneath her wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s because this body isn’t mine, isn’t it?” He asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt like sobbing as she looked up at him, at this boy who she had known for the same amount of time as Agatha had, who she could so plainly see her own child in, in the the gestures of kindness he handed out without expectation or fallacy. At this child she was going to have to take from the woman she loved above everything else, at the pain she was forcing Agatha to feel, at knowing there was nothing that could be done to rewrite this tragic ending.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes kid, it is”.
    </p>
    <p>
     He closed his eyes, grieving for a life he never got to live before opening them once more, “I didn’t think it was like... illegal”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled wetly, before wincing the moment Agatha’s hands tightened at witnessing their interaction, evidently moved at seeing the teenager she had taken under her wing bonding with the woman she still loved, as much as she might despise and deny that particular truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Illegal is one word for it,” she said through a weak smile, again attempting to offer comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     He attempted to smile back at her before a teary sniffle disrupting it’s bloom, forcing it into becoming more of a grimace, “and if I don’t come with you? If I refuse?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her responding chuckle was far more genuine at that particular response, for it was such a human thing to say when facing down death, the question of:
     <i>
      does it have to be now?
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It would be bad kid, for everyone”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Everyone?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Every single soul who has ever existed, who exists right now, and who is fated to exist in the future”.
    </p>
    <p>
     He drew in a ragged breath, obviously shocked at the ripples his stolen existence has had on the universe and it’s plans. “Well then,” he finally breathed, suddenly sounding far older than his actual age, “I suppose that answers that question then”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      No!
     </i>
     ” Agatha hissed again, still pinning Rio beneath her as she whipped her head back and forth between Rio’s turned face and Teen’s, who was still staring back at Rio with a mix of fear and determination. “Teen don’t you dare give in to this. You’re a
     <i>
      witch
     </i>
     , you’re a
     <i>
      survivor
     </i>
     . You don’t need to go with her just because she tells you to. You can
     <i>
      fight
     </i>
     ; you can
     <i>
      win!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     His responding words, not that he knew it at the time unlike Rio, had the power to cut Agatha to her core, “I- I
     <i>
      can’t
     </i>
     , it’s not right. I can’t expect the world to suffer so I can keep living, what sort of life would that be? I’d die from guilt before I took two steps in the opposite direction”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s mouth quickly dropped to argue back; Rio could tell from the slant of her eyebrows and the curl of her lip. However, she didn’t get the opportunity to push her point because another voice suddenly sounded out from a few feet away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There is another way, one previously lost to time… but I am fortunate enough to possess a unique two-way ticket to the past and have received consultation from a very wise, and very old woman”.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Lilia, returned from her travels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone’s focus fell to her as she strode forward on confident feet, her chin tilted up regally. She was truly the Queen of Cups in that moment, stepping forward to guide them all towards resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Consultation with who?” Alice asked, voice sceptical.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia smiled, looking fond as she spoke of the woman who had apparently provided her with the answer to their issue. “my Maestra from Sicily. An exceptionally wise witch, one who had already lived for centuries before she met her demise from influenza when I was a mere girl. She spoke of a spell, a specific incantation that can only be spoken by a true coven to try and save the soul of one of their own”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt a flare of unease at Lilia’s words, for what she said wasn't entirely untrue. Ample spells had indeed come in and out of existence over the years as humans did as they were determined to do; fight Rio tooth and nail over a few more measly years of unexceptional life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, the different range of spells that existed, and even more so, those that were actually effective and didn’t end up sucking the life from the coven in question were rare. Most of them had been lost to the consistent march of time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had never felt much fondness for them either if truth be told, for they caused complications in a process that should be, as nature dictated, straight forward and simple.
    </p>
    <p>
     Realising things were spiralling out of her control and in a direction she didn't care for, she tried to roll Agatha off of her and get up. But Agatha, stubborn witch that she was, refused to be moved.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Rio said, voice stern, “get off”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scowled down at her, “what’s the matter? You’ve been begging to be under me for centuries”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned heavily, her heart shuddering painfully at Agatha using Rio's heartbreak as a cruel jibe, one that hit home, Just as she intended it to.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get off Agatha, let me up,” Rio insisted, trying to push upwards just as Agatha’s hands started to spark with purple light to keep holding her down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed and waved her hand, which was still partially trapped beneath Agatha’s, summoning vines to shoot from the ground and wrap around Agatha’s wrists, ankles, and waist, dragging her off of Rio with a shrill cry of rage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood, dusting herself off as she turned to face Lilia, who was watching her with a knowing smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. Evidently, the divination witch knew exactly how this whole moment played out.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was an unnerving moment for a deity; facing a mortal who knew more than you. It was a strange, abstract sensation, one that she didn’t enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced toward Agatha, who she had spelled her vines to tie to a decorative trellis out of the way, who was now shouting furiously at being bound to a piece of garden furniture. Agatha would be furious at Rio for putting her in such a demeaning position, but Agatha already hated her, so what was one more slight in comparison to Rio's other offences, and she needed space and time to think, to listen to Lilia and figure out if this so-called spell actually held any weight.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What spell do you speak of witch?” Rio demanded, wrapping her robe around herself in an attempt to appear like the untouchable deity she should be, even though they had all seen her tackled to the ground by her furious wife only ten minutes earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The
     <i>
      Nexus Debitorum
     </i>
     : an exchange of Irreformable souls for another life, one far more deserving,” Lilia’s voice was confident, highlighting her certainty over this particular spell and it's chances of success.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyebrows shot up high on her forehead, surprised that this was the spell Lilia intended to try. It was real for one thing, a genuine spell that did indeed work to exchange the souls of a few evildoers to gain a second chance for somebody the universe considered worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was an exceptionally tricky endeavour to complete however, not only because the souls offered up in exchange had to be truly beyond any semblance of reformation or genuine remorse, but also the soul who was being bargained on behalf of had to have proven themselves to the universe in their lifetime; however short it might have been. In other words, they had to have something worth exchanging for, something that Rio herself would want or deign worth saving.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn’t a process to be taken lately, nor was it hardly ever successful. Which was why it had quite promptly fallen out of favour as an option to save a loved one.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The
     <i>
      Nexus-What?
     </i>
     ” Alice asked, voice pitched up with evident disbelief, before turning to Jen to share a frustrated, bemused expression.  "Guys, seriously. Please fill us in, we have no clue what the hell any of you are talking about?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio’s Death isn't she!? The evil bitch!” Agatha heckled from her trellis, “Billy stole a dying body when the scarlet witch destroyed her hex over Westview. She wants to take him because his existence upsets her precious
     <i>
      balance
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She spat the word balance mockingly as though it were the root of all evil, as though Rio was evil, as though she gained personal joy and fulfilment from doing simply what nature demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sighing Rio pinched the bridge of her nose as the other’s gasped in horror, having put together the deeper meaning beneath Agatha’s words.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take him?” Alice repeated, “you mean like, take him to the other side?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh
     <i>
      shit
     </i>
     ,” Jen breathed out, eyes now wide with dawning understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But she won’t,” Lilia drawled out, sounding as confident as a woman who had seen into the future would, “because the
     <i>
      Nexus Debitorum
     </i>
     will work”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay!” Alice sighed out, frustrated once more, “again, please guys. Please explain what the fuck is the
     <i>
      Nexus Debitorum
     </i>
     is for those of us who haven’t been alive since the dawn of god-damned time”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia started to speak as though she were a tutor in a lecture hall, “
     <i>
      Nexus Debitorum
     </i>
     is Latin, and it translates roughly to '
     <i>
      debt connection
     </i>
     '. It's a complicated rite for a coven to complete. If a coven collects enough souls, souls without hope for reformation, souls of those evil enough to continuously do harm without an ounce of remorse, they can be offered up to Death..." Lilia gestured toward Rio, as though she were merely a cardboard cut-out of the grim reaper being presented for educations sake, "...In exchange for one single life. But that life has to be deemed worthy, and it has to possess something Death desires, or at least something Death considers worth saving”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why do they have to be evil souls?” Jen asked with a heavy frown on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because they cease to exist,” Lilia answered simply. “It’s a punishment worse than death. They are stitched back into the fabric of everything, losing any semblance of sentience; their energy absorbed and their personhood, everything that made them who they are simply… gone; disappearing entirely from the record of humanity and denied ever crossing over into the great beyond, which is all of our destiny".
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia turned to Rio then, “isn’t that right
     <i>
      Rio?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     She said Rio’s name as though it were a name Rio had simply made up then and there, as though she was merely humouring her by saying it. Which was frustrating, because Rio had made it up. But it had been her name for over three centuries now, so to hear it spoken in such a flippant manner made her brows furrow with offence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia’s smirk wasn’t remedied by her evident displeasure though, for it was clear she had returned from her latest voyage through time with all of the answers, and apparently far more attitude than she had possessed a mere hour ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The spell exists,” Rio admitted, not allowing any level of opinion to bleed through into her tone, “but it has not been used or even attempted for centuries”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well surely it's worth a try?” Alice asked, voice hopeful and filled with youthful optimism.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And
     <i>
      where
     </i>
     …” Rio drawled, glancing from each set of eyes surrounding her; except for the pair burning into her from a few feet away, eyes the colour of an angry ocean tempest, “...exactly are you going to gather eight spiteful souls from in such a short space of time, hmm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     None of them could answer her, so Rio pushed her point, “not to mention, that particular spell has to be attempted whilst the soul of the saved is hovering between this realm and the next. It can’t be performed before or after”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A heavy silence descended then as the reality of what Lilia was proposing fell upon all of their shoulders, at the fact in order to be saved, Teen would have to be killed; his lungs frozen from drawing breath, his heart stopped from continuing it’s rhythmic beating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once again, a bolt of purple light to the stomach broke up the moment, as Agatha, who had finally burned through the thorny vines holding her captive, threw another strike of magic at Rio; this time hitting right on target.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was shunted backwards a few paces, doubling over with the intensity of the impact, as Agatha swept forward with determination burning in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll do it,” she said, voice dark with fury, “I’ll kill him. If it means he’ll live, I’ll do it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s temper flared, frustrated at consistently being on this side of these types of debates; arguing for natural balance, for the survival of the fucking universe, for the simple processes of life and death to be respected, and at being made to feel like the purest form of evil, for simply providing a service as vital to the continuation of life as birth.
    </p>
    <p>
     After all, as much as Agatha would argue the point, Rio was no more evil than fungus rotting wood, or an insect gnawing on fallen leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Put simply, she was doing her fucking job.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet Agatha still insisted on treating her like Rio did all of these things out of
     <i>
      choice
     </i>
     . As though Rio wasn’t a creature entirely bound by whatever the universe dictated to be law.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You still need eight souls that are beyond saving,” Rio growled, folding her arms across her chest stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes narrowed in that way they did whenever she knew Rio was withholding something, something important.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We have at least four souls beyond saving,” Agatha said pointedly, gesturing around the yard at the bodies sprawled across the lawn, each one a crumpled figure of dark cloth and black lace. “And I’m sure I could find four more with no real issue," she shrugged, unphased at the thought of stealing a few more lives. The irony apparently entirely lost on her that she was willing to kill in order to preserve.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she thinks Rio is the evil one.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I saw you collecting them too,” Agatha pressed when Rio didn’t say anything, eyes as flinty as her voice. Evidently any warmth she had been feeling towards Rio following their reunion had been burned away by the heat of her anger, like a spring frost melting under the full glare of the sun's beaming light. “You were collecting them in a jar, and I don’t want to hear a single argument about how the Salem Seven are bound for anywhere other than the darkest pits of hell. At least this way their pointless lives will be given a shred of meaning”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked around, feeling entirely outnumbered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not to mention, a part of her was entirely too eager to resolve this in a way that didn’t involve her taking another child from her wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps if it was possible, perhaps if it could be done, then she should allow it to be so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or at least she should allow them to try.
    </p>
    <p>
     She bit her lip, thinking deeply on the possible outcomes, on whether attempting this particular sacrament would have any overtly negative impacts on the processes of the world, or whether this too would be an acceptable trade, one the universe blesses as justice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio paused, glancing from one face to the next, taking in each of their expressions: Lilia’s small, knowing smirk; Jen’s wide-eyed frown; Alice, whose brows were drawn close together, carving a wrinkle into the skin between them; Billy, who was pale and shaking, but trying so hard to be brave whilst his demise was discussed so openly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before finally, her heavy gaze landed where it was always destined to, directly onto Agatha who was already staring back at her with a fierce, defensive scowl. She was glaring at her as though Rio were the enemy that her coven required defending from, as though Rio was no longer considered one of them anymore, as though Rio hadn’t fought alongside them through The Road's countless trials and tribulations.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was that final vision, and the agonising knowledge that she would always exist within her love’s mind as an evil villain, that forced a trembling confession from between her lips, “I have four more”.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Agatha’s eyebrows arched curiously, “you have four what? Four more souls?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked down, feeling caught. She had never actually intended on telling Agatha what she had done to her mother after the cabin; she had thought her wife need not endure another moment with that wretched woman at the forefront of her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alas fate, as it so often did, had deigned to push her down a different path.
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced back up, finding her gaze caught immediately by Agatha’s steely one once more, a gaze that always won in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The rest of the Salem Seven and… your mother,” she admitted, deciding it best to just admit the truth quickly, “I have your mother’s soul in there too”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s jaw dropped, “My
     <i>
      mother?!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shifted her weight from foot to foot, searching for the right words, words that might explain why, “I needed to deal with her, it’s my job”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Rio
     </i>
     ,” Agatha’s voice was sharp and pointed. Her name was an order for an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn’t have time to decide what to do with her right then, and it was a good job I didn’t dally considering you were drowning at the bottom of a mud-pit by that point”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's other eyebrow arching upwards to join it's twin was the only response she received, prompting her to continue explaining.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So I just... caught her. I wanted time to think it through, to figure out a fitting punishment for the woman who tormented you..." Rio felt a spark of warmth light in her chest, burning the chill from her bones at Agatha’s current expression, at how it had softened ever so slightly towards her, “...whose memory still torments you. She didn't deserve a peaceful reaping, and she certainly doesn’t deserve eternal peace. I wanted her to suffer, and I wanted to take my time making it so”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes glistened as she stared at Rio, first with tears and then with wonder. It was clear she was once again struggling to compartmentalise all of the feelings she was currently feeling, the same feelings she had spent a century burying beneath burning hatred whilst trying to keep Rio at arm’s length, intent on giving the impression that she was neither interested nor affected by anything Rio did or said.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a stilted pause, one in which Agatha had simply stared at Rio as though trying to decide whether to throttle her or kiss her, she sniffed and looked away, throwing up an errant, nonchalant hand, “well, there we go then. Eight hideous souls ready to be exchanged”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I still need to be worthy of saving,” Teen said quietly, nervously glancing between the two of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     was an easy enough question to answer, and even though Agatha thought she was evil, and even though she thought of Rio as little more than a monster who gleefully devoured the souls of innocent children to spite grieving parents, Rio felt the impulse to reassure him all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are worthy of saving Billy, that would have been clear to see even if we hadn’t travelled The Witches Road together”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A pleased smile lifted one side of his face, before it drooped once more, “but I have to possess something you consider worth saving". He glanced at each of them, hoping for a hint or a clue to the answer to his quandary, “but I don’t have anything worth saving, not worthy of
     <i>
      this
     </i>
     , at least”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen looked at one another hopelessly, each of them shrugging in turn to show they were out of ideas. Even Lilia looked unsure for the first time since flashing back from the past.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was, of course, Agatha who swept closer to Rio, who had once again softened her eyes to the point Rio knew she was about to be played like a god-damned fiddle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, even with that knowledge, she found herself leaning into the palm Agatha lifted to cup her jaw. With firm but gentle pressure, she guided Rio’s face toward her own, “he
     <i>
      does
     </i>
     own something you value, sweetheart”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Weak fool that she knew herself to be, Rio could do nothing but nuzzle into Agatha’s warm palm, relishing the brush of her skin against her cheek, “and what would that be my love?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He owns your debt, Rio. Twice over too, if I’m not mistaken”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked, “my debts?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He saved your wife’s life.
     <i>
      Twice
     </i>
     . Once on The Road, and once right here when he trusted me enough to shoot a bolt of magic into my heart”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes widened with realisation, for the words Agatha spoke were true. He had indeed saved Agatha's life,
     <i>
      twice
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha drew Rio's attention back from her own thoughts with light pressure on her jaw, “do you not count that as something
     <i>
      worthy of value?
     </i>
     Something
     <i>
      worthy of mercy and trade?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     She was biting her lip, staring imploringly into Rio’s eyes as her thumb swept backwards and forwards across the line of Rio’s cheekbone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew she was being manipulated, but she still wasn’t strong enough to resist it all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do,” Rio said, her voice a solemn vow, “I value it above
     <i>
      everything
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded slowly, like a snake hypnotising a mouse with wide, captivating eyes before it eventually struck out to pierce it's victims heart and pump it full of venom, “so, he
     <i>
      does
     </i>
     have something you want, doesn’t he? You want to clear the debt you owe him; you want to thank him for saving my life”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed once, her eyes flickering across Agatha’s face. It was hard to get an honest read on her right now, for she was wrapped up so tightly behind her walls, all of the walls Rio had spent the past few months slowly breaking down again. Rio knew, after all, what Agatha’s mask looked like. She knew what it looked like when she wore the face of a woman who was manipulating for the sake of a scheme, as though Rio was little more than a mark who needed a little push to further one of her ploys and not her actual wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes drifted then, from Agatha’s face to Billy’s, who was still stood beside them all, shaking and pale, evidently not feeling confident in his ownership of Death's debts, debts she would indeed be willing to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright Agatha,” Rio drawled, keeping her eyes on Billy and taking a step backwards, suddenly in dire need of space from her wife's fake affection, no longer able to stomach false fondness from the woman she was willing to pause death for. Looking around she stared at each of them in turn, ensuring her gaze was solemn enough and weighted honestly with the task ahead, "you have my permission to attempt such a feat. But heed my warning, it doesn’t always work and it doesn’t always take”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze fell upon Agatha’s once more, who now she had gotten from Rio what she desired, had taken to scowling at her as Rio spoke her final warning, “the universe will claim it’s pound of flesh either way. It always does”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And with that she pulled the jar of souls from her robe, placed them on the ground at Agatha’s feet and drifted away to wait in the shadows, gifting them time to prepare for the ceremony that they were determined to attempt. Unwilling too, to stand there and be the focus of her wife’s disdain for another moment longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      AGATHA
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     with the souls already collected, it hadn’t taken them long to prepare.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact the preparations were simple:
    </p>
    <p>
     A circle carved into the earth by Alice; their protection witch.
    </p>
    <p>
     A blessing from Jen, who sprinkled her quickly brewed concoction over the engraved circle in generous doses; their potions witch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia, their divination witch, having taken heed from her Maestra, was designing the positions of their ceremony from the ways of old, crafting in her mind's eye the precise tableau their coven must create in order to complete the sacrement correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, their green witch, had inadvertently completed her part of the ritual already by providing them with a jar of recently harvested souls.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, their death witch, hadn’t asked to borrow Rio’s knife for her dark deed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead she had stalked after Rio, following her into the dark shadows cast by the overhanging canopy, where they were hidden from view from the others who were still completing their preparations. There she had pinned Rio against the rough bark of an old oak tree with rougher hands and drawn the blade from it’s sheath on Rio's belt with a painfully slow drag. Their eyes had been locked the entire time, their gazes holding a myriad of conversations simultaneously; questions and answers, accusations and admissions, declarations and detestations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, as though not entirely in control of her own impulses, Agatha found herself jerking closer to Rio in a singular jagged movement, as though her desire to capture Rio’s mouth, to punish her carnally for all she had done to their love had overtaken her body without prior thought or restraint. Fortunately, she managed to gain control of herself just as quickly, and before her lips could brush Rio’s and she lost herself completely to a temptation that was agonisingly painful to resist, she hauled herself backwards, stumbling away from the warmth of Rio’s body as though it had burned her. She turned on unsteady feet and with ragged breathing returned to the others, leaving Rio in the lonely shadows of the yard, berating herself internally for being so damn fickle the entire time.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Agatha Harkness truly was the definition of heart
     <i>
      vs
     </i>
     head. Of impulse
     <i>
      vs
     </i>
     restraint. Of hate
     <i>
      vs
     </i>
     love.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind felt like a constant battlefield when it came to Rio, especially now, with that same familiar fight feeling harder than it ever had before. It was a constant thing; a never-ending scrimmage to maintain this level of anger at the woman she wanted, more than anything, to turn and collapse into.
    </p>
    <p>
     The others didn't say anything about her harried appearance, much to her relief, and after a few more long, tense minutes they were ready to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy, as directed by Lilia, lay in the centre of the circle with his arms and legs stretched out; their very own renaissance man.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood at his head, inside the carved circle so her visage would be upside down from his perspective. She swallowed nervously whilst looking down at him, taking note of just how young he looked, of how she would be his murderer if this all went wrong. Her thoughts spiralled slightly, for the realisation hit her then, that if that was indeed the case and he did actually die, his death would be the first she would both cause and mourn. An absurd thought for a serial killer, but alas it was the one haunting her as she looked down at him. Their eyes met and she attempted to give him a cocky grin, a grin that said
     <i>
      you’ve beaten Death before, we’ll beat her again together
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen stood on either side of the circle, although they were outside of it. Their hands were raised, pressing forward and flat as though pushing against a solid barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia stood on a garden chair behind Agatha, the overseer of all. She was to lead to incantation and the ceremony, as though she was a conductor and they her grand orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio, Rio stood at his feet. A dark wraith wrapped in darker robes, glaring at the scene with eyes that shone with barely hidden grief. Grief Agatha could see plainly, grief that Agatha wanted to heal.
    </p>
    <p>
     But her fury wouldn’t allow her to soften, not right now, not until this was done and Billy was safe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Death had to wait to be welcomed in to this particular ceremony Lilia had told them, like the vampires of old, waiting to be invited to cross the threshold into an unsuspecting victim's residence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Silence!
     </i>
     ” Lilia called out, her tone ancient and regal.
    </p>
    <p>
     They all did as ordered; even the night-time crickets and the leaves fluttering in the breeze seemed to take heed of her order and faded into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This coven of mine has convened here today with intention of exchanging eight irredeemable souls to the majesty of the universe, in exchange for one singular soul. The soul of Billy Maximoff, a witch of our coven, a coven of mavericks joined together by the desire to unite and protect this young life from passing through that bleak veil and onwards still to where we cannot reach him”.
    </p>
    <p>
     No one spoke. The wind didn’t whistle, the birds didn't sing, and no small mammal scurried through the underbrush to make the grass sway and rustle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia glanced around at each of them before continuing, “Death. We summoned you here today to cast your judgement on Billy Maximoff. To ask you if you find his heart true, or if you find it wanting, and most importantly if this soul possesses something you yourself covet, something that only his continued existence on this plain can provide”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swept closer, cutting an intimidating figure with her humanity dissolved from her person, leaving her skeletal and majestic beneath her dark hood. She was and always had been beautiful, and Agatha felt a lump start to burn in her throat at just how lonely she looked opposite her in the moonlight, as though she had already accepted the fact her place in this coven they had built together was merely temporary.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shaking her head, she brought herself back to reality, forcing herself to focus on the ceremony at hand as Lilia continued to speak the words of the ancient sacrament, “Death. If it so pleases you, step forward into the circle if you are willing to consider our offering”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did so, pacing forward into the circle at Billy’s feet with a single graceful step.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Death, you have accepted our invitation, we thank you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt Lilia brush her shoulder and lean closer to whisper urgently, “
     <i>
      now
     </i>
     , you need to do it
     <i>
      now
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded and felt, for the first time, terrified to kill someone.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gripped Rio’s knife tightly, finding comfort in the worn handle beneath her palm, smoothed over eons from Rio’s fingers holding it in just the same way. Breathing deeply, Agatha dropped to kneel over Billy’s head. Gently, she reached forward to move a few of his curls from his forehead with her other hand, which she noted with an absent thought, was shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     He smiled up at her, trying so hard to mask the fear she could see radiating through his tight expression. “Hey,” he breathed out, even now attempting levity to appease her. This boy, she couldn’t help but think, this dear boy so similar to her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” she whispered back softly, “I’m sorry it has to be a knife. If I used magic it might interfere with the process, crossed streams and all that arcane nonsense”.
    </p>
    <p>
     He eyed Rio’s curved knife nervously, gulping slightly before his widened eyes returned to her own, “it’s alright, at least if I survive this I’ll have a cool scar”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked, feeling frustratingly endeared, “you mean
     <i>
      when
     </i>
     you survive this,” she insisted, “you'll have a cool scar. And guess what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” He asked, wide-eyed and thankfully distracted enough, which is what she was aiming for.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Boys dig scars,” she told him with a cheeky wink, before quicker than he would be able to flinch away from, she brought the knife up to thrust it down into his chest right through his heart. She left it there for a lingering moment before tugging it free with a grisly wrench to hold it by her side, where the blade started to drip scarlet beads onto the grass beside her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen both flinched as she did so, choking back screams as a sharp, breathless gasp echoed out from behind her; all of them shocked at her fierce brutality, at how little she wavered when thrusting a knife through a teenagers ribcage.
    </p>
    <p>
     How little they knew her still, how truly ruthless she could be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thankfully, Billy died quickly. He didn’t lay their writhing in agony, he didn’t scream or cry or beg, like any other number of people might have.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, he simply coughed once, sputtered twice, and then drooped sideways with the smirk from Agatha’s last jest still frozen on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, it was Agatha who lost her composure, who whimpered loudly at his lax expression, at his glassy eyes. It was Agatha who was forced to stuff her sob back into her mouth with the flat of her palm, who then retreated on shaky feet to watch as Rio lifted one hand up towards the sky to draw Billy’s soul from his mouth, where it hovered just above blue lips, acting as the alter on which their dark exchange would occur.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Death,” Lilia called out, her barely restrained horror evident in the warble Agatha could now hear in her voice, “we present to the universe these eight souls, eight souls cut from the darkest, most cruel fabric the cosmos possesses," she held up the jar and started to twist the lid free.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was clear the souls of the Salem Seven and her mother could sense dark magic was afoot, for the glowing orbs behind the glass were vibrating, buzzing from side to side with the speedy flight of hummingbirds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We commit these souls to your grandness, and ask for these souls to be merged with you, to be threaded into your oblivion and removed from the cycle of life in exchange for this soul here,” Lilia gestured to  life-force, providing the sign Agatha, Jen, and Alice had all been waiting for to do the same, each of them pointing a sparking finger at Billy’s soul as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you willing to consider the trade?” Lilia asked, voice growing in confidence the longer she continued speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am,” Rio intoned, her voice double-toned and bassy; appearing every bit the universe's ambassador in the shadowy darkness. Agatha would be lying if the figure Rio cut in that moment didn’t cause a frisson of electricity to zip up her spine. After all, knowing that Rio was entirely dedicated to
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     , that Agatha had a deity of Rio’s immensity at her beck and call, if she so desired that is, well, it was a pretty intoxicating sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What does this soul possess that you think interests me?” Rio asked plainly, the words falling from her mouth as though they were from a well-rehearsed script.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This soul,” Lilia answered, continuing her part in this strange, dangerous dance, “possesses something you desire Death. He possesses absolution. Absolution of debts you owe him, two debts to be precise. For he saved the woman you love, the woman you soul-bonded with over three centuries ago. Does this, or does this does not hold worthy value to you? To be gifted forgiveness for these debts in exchange for saving his soul”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes found Agatha’s then like ships being called home through a storm, “I do, Lilia Calderu of Sicily. I crave absolution from these debts and hold nothing higher in my esteem than the safety of my wife”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt tears pool in her eyes at Rio’s words, that even now her focus was entirely on Agatha, on Agatha’s happiness, on her wellbeing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thank you Death for answering our plea and our plight. Now, I must ask my sister-witches to chant the incantation, to expand our request outward and see if the universe agrees with it’s herald; that this is a debt worthy of payment, that these souls crafted from wicked matter are beyond reform, and that this soul,” she gestured toward Billy’s soul, shining blue and beautiful above his pale, still face, “is worthy of saving”.
    </p>
    <p>
     They did as ordered and all of the coven, bar Rio who stood with her eyes closed and her lips parted, looking disarmingly melancholy and beautiful in the moonlight, started to chant the ancient words Lilia had taught them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Over and over again, they repeated the incantation, and on the third repetition of the archaic song, Lilia released the lid on the jar, prompting the souls of her hideous mother and the Salem Seven to dart from their glass prison and attempt to fly for freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
     They continued to chant, each of them keeping their eyes glued to the souls zipping through the night sky, glowing like large, bulbous fireflies, trying to escape the dangerous magic they could obviously feel thrumming around them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, as they reached the edge of the garden and started to slide through the heavy boughs of the dark overhanging canopy, Agatha felt her heart shudder fearfully in her chest, almost certain that her coven's plea had failed and the universe had declined their request. A single breath grew ragged in her lungs and she felt suddenly terrified to look down upon the boy she had killed, a boy she had murdered with a cold, curved knife.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, before her grief could consume her she heard a resounding pop, as one of the fleeing souls quite literally exploded into a flash of raining sparks. Then, one by one, as though triggered by the first, each of the Salem Seven’s souls burst in a show of sparkling lights that fell to the earth like embers from a fire, glowing momentarily before fading to ash. Finally, there was only one soul left, her mother, who was zipping from side to side in a desperate bid to save herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as they had all come to learn and as Rio had so aptly put it, the universe would claim it’s pound of flesh, one way or the other, and Agatha watched with dark delight as her mother’s soul came to a screeching halt, only to be devoured by the universe in a flurry of sparks, a universe hungry enough to consume her in one great big gulping bite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Agatha breathed for the first time in what felt like hours as her eyes immediately dropped down to Billy’s face. She watched with desperate hope as his soul started to move too, although most alarmingly of all, not down towards his body but up higher away from it whilst swaying side to side, as though tempted to drift off and explore all of the secrets Death held close to her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     A curiosity that was confirmed the moment Rio’s eyes flickered from Agatha’s face, from where they had been planted this entire time, to her left where no one stood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or at least, no one Agatha could see.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled, eyes crinkling prettily even though her mouth was entirely bone and sinew, “yeah I know,” she said to thin air, pointing at her own face, “you're right, it would be a great Halloween costume”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head, watching intently as Rio continued her ghostly conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know, it feels cruel but trust me, they had it coming. Especially Agatha’s mother”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “ – “
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I know. She’s a bitch. Or at least she
     <i>
      was
     </i>
     ,” Rio smirked at her own jest, before her smile widened at whatever Billy said in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “ – “
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know, I understand your curiosity. But there are a lot of people here who have worked really hard to keep you around. You'll see it all in the end anyway, it doesn't remain a mystery for long. Trust me".
    </p>
    <p>
     “ – “
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s only tempting you right now because being unattached from a body feels good. It’s lighter, and it feels like stretching muscles you didn’t even know needed stretching. But I don’t think Agatha would ever forgive you, or me for that matter, if you didn’t sink back into your body soon. And you have to do it soon, the windows for these sorts of exchanges are short and the universe is temperamental. It doesn’t like to have it’s goodwill abused or mocked”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “ – “
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked shocked at whatever Billy had said, before flushing heavily, an absurd image considering only half her face was flesh. Agatha felt suddenly desperate to know what Billy had said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes... well. I would be lying if I said my motives weren’t entirely selfish. Now please, do us all a favour, and just drop. That’s it, it will feel like that moment when your trying to go to sleep and it feels like your suddenly falling. That’s it Billy, just close your eyes and…
     <i>
      drop
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment that final word left Rio’s lips, Billy’s soul darted back through his lips and his eyes shot open. He sat up quickly, hand to his chest clutching the spot Agatha had driven the knife into.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Holy shit
     </i>
     ,” he gasped out through desperate pants. His hair was sticking up at all sorts of wild angles and blood was staining both his clothing and the patch of glass he was still sprawled on. He looked around at them all with wide, wild eyes, before finally panting out, “well, that was
     <i>
      insane
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt the breath that had been lodged painfully in her lungs finally wheeze out at seeing him filled with life once more. Relief nearly drowned her too, for the only real sign that he had recently been killed was a slight darkening of the bags beneath his eyes, as though all he needed to rectify any ailment he might have procured on his journey back to life was a good night’s sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Billy
     </i>
     ,” it was all she could find the strength to do, to breathe his name out into the night, so pleased that she could utter it with anything other than grief that it came out far more quiet and subdued than she ever normally was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her own relief was quite promptly overshadowed by Alice’s, who with a cry of joy promptly jumped atop him, tackling him back to the ground with a victorious, “fuck yeah, you’re alive!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen, who was grinning broadly but still managing to maintain a semblance of dignity quickly had it ripped from her, because both Teen and Alice, with matching grins on their faces, each grabbed one of her wrists to tug her down atop their bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia, who had since clambered down from her chair, came to stand beside Agatha. She had a relieved grin blooming on her face and tear tracks shining on her cheeks as she watched the rest of their coven with affectionate eyes, laughing quietly when Jen tried to wriggle free from Alice and Teen’s hold, only to be quickly grabbed once more and tugged backwards to mix amongst their childish fit of limbs, despite her loud, dramatic protestations.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not tempted to join the party, Lilia?” Agatha drawled, her own amusement at their antics forcing her lips to quirk upwards too, as much as she would deny it if questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My back barely survived us piling out of that damned tower,” Lilia answered before asking rather abruptly, “where’s Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s neck snapped up with telling speed to stare at the patch of darkness Rio had been standing in mere moments ago. Agatha scowled, aware of Rio’s ability to bend shadows to her will, and the fact she had the audacity to creep away the moment Agatha’s attention had been pulled down to the dying teenager at her feet. The knowledge that she had felt the need to do so in the first place settled heavily in Agatha’s stomach, prompting the reaction discontent so often did within her; anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Which wasn’t helped at all by the fact her feelings for Rio, which were still mixing violently together in her stomach, as they had been since she had regained her memories, were wavering from one state to the next with the ease of a button being pressed: turning her fury into guilt, guilt into yearning, yearning into love, love into lust, and then back to anger to restart to terrible cycle. All of which had been heightened and made worse through experiencing her greatest trauma a second time round, like some sort of sick mirror of past torments.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was
     <i>
      confusing
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     She was
     <i>
      confused
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio dissolving into the darkness provided Agatha with a well-needed moment to simply think, to gather her thoughts, and try to stubbornly reassert to herself that she didn’t
     <i>
      need
     </i>
     Rio, that she was still
     <i>
      furious
     </i>
     at Rio, that she was far too angry to ever consider even
     <i>
      trying
     </i>
     to be with her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     That the very thought of such an attempt was an impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet…
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart still started to keen as though it were a widow wailing at the graveside of a lost lover, broken at even the notion of Rio leaving her here alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a hideous thought, returning to the bleak reality of existing without Rio again, at having to force herself to pretend like her act of indifference didn’t cause her soul to freeze over as though her own personal winter had started to bloom beneath her ribs, spreading frost along bone and shooting it’s icy fingers into the depths of her lungs, turning warm breath to cold mist.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, she did as she always did when feeling particularly vulnerable, she fell back on humour as a defence; humour and a forced nonchalance that hurt her heart to enact.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not her damn keeper Lilia, if she wanted to leave so badly she is free to do so,” Agatha snapped, before sniffing once and tilting her chin up arrogantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia hummed from beside her, a knowing sound that immediately prompted Agatha’s hackles to rise. “Oh, I just thought… I thought I saw a different end-” she waved a wayward hand, chuckling as though she was simply an old woman rambling on about the weather. “Ignore me, I must have seen wrong”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha narrowed her eyes at the other witch, crossing her arms across her chest as she did so, “I know when I’m being played, Lilia”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The older witch shrugged faux-innocently, “I have no idea what you’re implying. All I know is that woman has been by your side through every damn phase of this ordeal, and if that isn’t worth at least a conversation then I’m not sure what is”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scowled at having the truth pointed out to her quite so bluntly. She was having a hard enough time battling with herself, without Lilia pointing out just how Rio had acted with such loyalty and devotion, how she had shown her love for Agatha with every action the had committed, and at how hard she had worked to keep her safe whilst Agatha had been unable to defend herself properly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen, Alice, and Teen all clocked their conversation, as though Agatha’s emotional instability was a prime steak and the three of them a pack of hungry hyenas.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you going to go get her?” Alice asked, as though the answer were an easy one. Which to Alice, Agatha couldn’t help but think bitterly, it must have been. None of them knew after all, they didn’t know the depths of her and Rio’s connection, the levels and tiers of devotion and pain that their relationship was constructed from, like the Frankenstein's monster of love stories.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. No, I am not,” Agatha ground out through clenched teeth, “she’s done some terrible things”. She threw an impatient hand at Billy, who was still laying on the ground with his hands behind his head, as though he was simply stargazing and not taking part in an ancient spell to save his soul, “she tried to take Teen!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy angled his head to look at her from over his shoulder, “she was just doing her job Agatha,” he shrugged, the movement awkward from how he was still lying prone, “I did
     <i>
      steal
     </i>
     this body”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah but-” her argument was promptly cut off by Jen, whose voice was as snarky as ever, evidently delighting in the team venture of emotionally beating Agatha to a pulp.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No but’s. You’ve been both alive and a witch long enough to know certain laws are to be upheld. Death is one of them”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her no-nonsense tone was the worst of them so far, not at all helped by how simple Jen made it seem. As though Death merely was something to accept like Rio had said in the final trial, and not something to fight and beat into submission.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Plus,” Alice drawled, climbing to her feet before offering a hand to both Jen and Teen to haul them up to stand beside her, “she didn’t even take him, she did her part without argument as far as I could see. Even persuaded him to come back”. She dug her elbow into Teen’s side, “when the little shit was going to drift off towards the light, after all the effort we put in to get him back”.
    </p>
    <p>
     He flushed and rubbed a sheepish palm over the back of his neck, “I know, I know,” he droned, “I just- it’s hard to explain just how good it felt. It felt like complete freedom”. He sighed then shrugged, as a small embarrassed grin spread across his face, “at least I’m not afraid of death anymore”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t share in his amusement, for it felt like her head was reeling, violently so.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was hard enough experiencing the sensation of her fear masking itself as fury at the thought of pursuing Rio and having a genuinely honest conversation with her, without hearing everyone else’s opinion and input on the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t know which impulse to give in to, and found circling between the two was making her dizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Did she do as her stubborn streak wanted and insist she was better off without her, or did she give in to the louder voice and sprint from this garden to get her wife back where she belonged: by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Should she give in to everything her heart was screaming out for so loudly it was getting harder and harder to ignore with every moment that passed without Rio in front of her, or silence it with an act of callous indifference that she knew would poison them both.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her confusion must have been clear in her expression, because for the first time since she had met this rabble of witches their voices were warm, almost gentle when addressing her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Jen said softy, “it’s quite straightforward; do you love her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes shot up from staring at the ground, latching onto Jen’s dark gaze who was staring back at her with a small, knowing smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha, who felt her final defence crumble to the ground at such a simple question, could do nothing but nod.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then what are you doing still standing here kiddo? Go get our green witch back,” Lilia said softly, squeezing Agatha’s arm in what was, sadly, one of the first gestures of maternal affection Agatha had ever experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused for a mere moment as a thousand different thoughts rushed through her mind at once. Thoughts of Agnes, of the hex, of the Scarlet witch and her children, of Rio beside her; first to help her with her scheme and then simply to help her survive. The Road was next, of feeling so deeply drawn to her; to her smile, to her laugh, to her quirks and eccentricities, to her power, and her ability to match Agatha stride-for-stride in all they did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moments of the past blurred with instances of the present. Of her darling Nicky, a child as much Rio’s as her own. Of Teen, a boy so like Nicky, who had woken from death to say he didn’t blame Rio for what she had to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     Would Nicky think the same?
    </p>
    <p>
     Would Nicky understand?
    </p>
    <p>
     Would he forgive Agatha for still loving his mother so desperately, even though she was the one who had taken him and led him towards the beyond, out of Agatha’s reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she glanced at Billy’s face, so open and free of bitterness, even after everything he had endured in his short life the answer became clear, an answer that had been blurred from her view through the haze of her grief for so long.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Of course he would
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     That was all it took for her to turn and grab Lilia's shoulders with both hands, her urgency now eclipsing all other thoughts and feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m going to get our green witch back”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia smiled at her as a few more tears slid from her eyes to graze over her lined cheeks, “damn straight”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And before Agatha could even ask, Lilia tilted her head towards the house shrouded in shadow in front of the yard, “she’s not far”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t need to hear anything else beyond that and on nimble feet, she shot forward, taking the porch steps three at a time before slamming through the back door into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was silent inside and there was no definitive clues as to where Rio was, but she allowed her instincts and heart to lead her upstairs to Agnes’s bedroom; the bedroom she and her dear neighbour Rio had shared more often than not, even whilst under the flaky disguise of mere friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned into the room and felt her heart start to pound in fear when she found it empty. Spinning in a wide circle, her panic only heightened until a shadow in the corner rippled and from it swept her wife, with a subdued, almost fearful expression on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Rio said softly, the note of surprise in her voice evident. She had reclaimed her human face once more; a telling sign that Rio felt vulnerable, that she required an element of armour to guard herself against the heartbreak she was obviously anticipating.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you lurking in here like a real-life boogieman?” Agatha drawled, unable to stop herself from being an asshole, even in these most delicate of moments.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed, glancing first at Agnes’s vanity table, one that possessed a large mirror in which several polaroid shots had been lovingly slid into the frame, each one a snapshot of Rio’s smirking face and Agnes’s grinning one beaming at the camera, and then down at the single photograph she held in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t stop the snort of derision, derision that felt an awful lot like jealousy as she stalked closer and snatched the photo from Rio, just as she was trying to press it down into one of the deep, never-ending pockets of her robe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifted it higher, taking advantage of the moonbeam streaming through the window to see the image more clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why the hell do you want this? I’m not even in it,” she groused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face remained stoic from beneath her hood, “well, I don’t have any of us together. And it might not technically be you in the photo, but it’s still your smile. You’re still looking at me like…” Rio’s voice drifted off quietly, as though afraid to say what she was going to aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like
     <i>
      what?
     </i>
     ” Agatha needled, her attention drawing back to Rio like that of a predator scenting blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed. It was a sad sound, one that sounded far too much like giving up. “Like you love me,” she admitted quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stared at Rio, enjoying the way the moonlight was streaming across her face, casting her half in shadow and highlighting the natural lines of her features; the cut of her jawline and the defined score of her cheekbone. The moment lingered as she stretched her neck, gifting herself a moment to determine, now that she was here with Rio in front of her, whether this route forward was truly the one she wanted to pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio licking her lips nervously was all the motivation she needed, as her eyes zeroed in on the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed then as her final decision was made and she felt a heady rush of anticipation start to burn in her stomach, as that primal part of her, the hunter she was at heart geared up to capture her quarry. It was showtime.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You owe me an apology, you know,” Agatha crooned, her voice although quiet, sounding loud enough in the silence of the house that it could rival a gunshot at dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyebrows shot up in dubious surprise, “an apology? For what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha narrowed her eyes at her and took a step closer, until she was close enough to back Rio into the vanity positioned behind her, “you owe me an apology for many,
     <i>
      many
     </i>
     things Rio Vidal. Including one for how quickly you ran out of that garden, like a damned coward”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scowled, her own temper rising quickly, “I didn’t run. I wanted to get this,” she said, snatching the polaroid back from Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment her hands were free Agatha grabbed Rio’s waist with both palms, tightening her grip possessively as she pushed her even further into the vanity table, causing bottles of perfume and lotion to wobble with the impact of their combined weight. “Agree to disagree,” she sniped out petulantly, “but that isn’t even the apology I’m talking about right now”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes, although Agatha could feel how her body was relaxed under Agatha’s touch, intent and content to stay where Agatha put her, “oh? Do enlighten me then”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m talking about those damn thorns on those vines you used to tie me up. They were sharp little fuckers, look…”
    </p>
    <p>
     She brought one of her hands up directly into Rio’s eyeline, drawing her attention to the deep, red scratches that had been carved into the skin of her wrist from the vine’s thorns. Blood that had dried and become sticky decorated her pale skin in a grisly design, having dribbled down over the back of her hand and up to stain the sleeve of the dress she had summoned for herself the moment she had felt magic bristling beneath her skin once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah,” Rio breathed out, a smirk tugging at her lips as she studied the deep scratches, “I’d say I was sorry, but you were pummelling me with arcane blasts at the time, so it was technically self-defence”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes narrowed at Rio’s amusement, feeling the heat that had been simmering in her stomach and left unsatisfied for far too long start to boil beneath her skin, “you’re refusing to apologise for making me bleed?”
    </p>
    <p>
     ”I'm not going to apologise Agatha, but I can still help all the same,” Rio said, her voice a husky whisper before lifting Agatha’s wrist to her lips and licking a decadent stripe across her bloody skin, causing the broken flesh to stitch itself back together as though the injury never existed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shuddered and leant even more of her body weight against Rio, who managed to spin them round as she continued to lather Agatha’s wrist with luxurious attention. She drew back only when her entire wrist was healed and cleaned of any traces of blood. She was an entirely sinful vision in that moment; her mouth reddened from Agatha’s blood with a trail of spit linking her swollen lips to Agatha’s skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How’s that?” Rio asked teasingly, “any better?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t reply verbally, she simply lifted her other wrist toward Rio’s mouth and arched an eyebrow, as if to say, ‘
     <i>
      you’re not finished yet
     </i>
     ’.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s responding grin was feral, and suddenly, as though given the greenlight to continue gifting Agatha her unwavering attention, she ran both her hands down to grip the back of Agatha’s thighs and lifted them so she was sat on the vanity behind her, legs spread with Rio standing between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, almost painfully slowly, Rio wrapped her hand around Agatha’s wrist and tugged it toward her mouth, where she continued to heal the broken, bloody skin of that wrist too, all the while staring directly into Agatha’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Fuck
     </i>
     ,” Agatha hissed out, reaching out to grab a handful of Rio’s hair, just for something to hold onto.
    </p>
    <p>
     “All better now?” Rio asked, her breathing as ragged as Agatha’s felt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My ankles were torn up too,” Agatha said, voice dark with desire as she curled one of her legs around Rio who was still stood snugly between her thighs, “they're stinging”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked at her, before concluding her attentions to Agatha’s wrist with one final lap of her hot tongue, “well, we can’t have that can we”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, as though she wanted Agatha to simply combust and die, she slowly dropped to her knee’s in front of her, Rio’s dark eyes locked onto Agatha’s as she made her torturous descent.
    </p>
    <p>
     With graceful steady hands, she pulled Agatha’s ankle toward her mouth and gave it the same attention as her wrists, being conscientious of the sensitive skin beneath her ankle bone and making Agatha’s pulse drop to pound furiously between her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without being asked, she traded the first ankle for her second, and repeated her motions, healing Agatha’s wounds with teasing dedication, before rising once more with feline litheness to rest between Agatha’s spread thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have I made up for my thorns yet, sweetheart?” Rio asked, her soft tone in stark contrast to the deep heat sparking in her dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s voice was a deep rumble when she pointed toward a large rip across her stomach where a big thorn had sliced through the purple fabric of her dress, and then through the skin of her stomach too before curling around her sides towards her back, leaving a dark red line across the pale skin, “this one wraps all the way round”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It does?” Rio asked, bringing her hands up towards the tear in Agatha's dress so she could grab either side of the rip with trembling fingers, “does it hurt?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Agatha sighed out, arching closer to where Rio was gripping the ragged edges of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you want me to fix it for you?” Rio asked, pulling the material tight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha only found enough air to breathe out another trembling “yes,” before Rio had taken the initiative and tugged her hands apart in one violent motion, ripping the existing tear all the wider and baring Agatha’s stomach to the cool air. Agatha gasped, but it turned swiftly into a moan the moment she felt Rio’s hot tongue swipe at the skin of her stomach, causing her muscles to tremble and shake at the sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
     With hands that demanded and didn’t ask, Rio tugged her forward so she slid from the vanity back onto shaky feet, before guiding her to turn in a slow circle, providing her with access to the continuous line of broken skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Fuck
     </i>
     ,” she husked out again the moment Rio tugged her that final inch and brought her to a stop, so she was now facing the vanity with her hands splayed out over it’s flat surface in order to hold herself up. Rio continued to hold her still from behind, so she could lather the small of her back with attention and mend the final few scratches not yet healed by her therapeutic tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t stop staring at the image they made together: at herself; flushed with her iris’s swallowed by dilated pupils, and Rio; her dark robes and darker eyes appearing dangerous and alluring in the shadowy light of the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her chest was heaving under her dress, even more so when Rio grabbed the edges of the tear again and tugged, causing it to rip upwards and exposing even more of her bare back to the moonlight streaming through the window. Rio followed the rip with her mouth, simply taking the opportunity to taste her skin now there were no more cuts from sharp thorns to heal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hot mouth was distracting enough to make Agatha pant like a dog, creating a fog of condensation to bloom upon the mirror’s cool surface as Rio dragged greedy palms around the curve of Agatha’s waist, taking a moment to dip them down to take possessive hold of Agatha’s hips, bare now aside from her underwear and tug her backwards, until the curve of her ass was tucked tightly against Rio’s pelvis.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agatha
     </i>
     ,” Rio hissed as though her name alone was a prayer worthy of reverence, sounding needy and desperate even though Agatha was the one currently being ravished.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew what Rio wanted, she wanted permission, she could tell because her long fingers were tightening just above her hip bones, sliding closer to the band of her underwear.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha had never been merciful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not to the witches she killed, not to herself, and especially not to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, instead of granting consent immediately, she decided to tease her slightly and dangle the proverbial carrot for a few torturous moments longer. She knew that by doing so she was teasing herself too, but she knew Rio and she knew if she made her wait a few minutes more her ferality would take over and Agatha would be ravished within an inch of her life; just how she liked it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you remember what you said to me on The Road?” She asked instead of whimpering a "yes" as Rio wanted her to, before gasping slightly when Rio’s nails dug into her hips impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I said a lot of things to you on The Road, Agatha,” Rio growled back, pressing herself even closer against her back as she dragged one of her fingers along the band of Agatha’s panties, turning the tables ever so well on Agatha for her mercurial nature.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Ah
     </i>
     ,” Agatha breathed out, clenching her eyes against the onslaught of sensations Rio was causing to erupt across her overly sensitive skin. “Yes, but do you remember what you said under the tree after Alice’s trial? When I was practically begging you to fuck me and you didn’t out of a rare, ill-timed burst of righteousness?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grip tightened on her hip as her other, more adventurous hand flattened out and slid in one single agonising glide down to rest between the thin fabric of her underwear and the hot, flushed skin of her lower stomach, “I do”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What did you say sweetheart, let me hear it again,” Agatha crooned, smirking even though she could feel the heat in her stomach start to boil to an almost painful degree at being left unsatisfied for such a frustrating amount of time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I said…” Rio whispered, pushing her hand even further until she was cupping Agatha's centre with a possessive palm, “that when you get your memories back, if you could still remember that particular moment and you still wanted me to fuck you, even the hordes of hell wouldn’t be able to stop me from doing so”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s right,” she hummed, unable to stop her hips from grinding down onto Rio’s fingers, who was holding them painfully still. “And right now, I have my memories back, and I can recall clearly that moment beneath the tree when you were so chivalrous and so fucking beautiful and now-
     <i>
      ah
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her breath caught in her throat as Rio finally started to move her hand, gliding low to gather wetness on the tips of her fingers before dragging it up to start circling her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled darkly beside her ear, amused at her distraction, “and now what?” She prompted, sounding far too smug.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head back, leaning it on Rio’s shoulder who was more than happy to hold her up. Their eyes met in the mirror, both dark with desire for the other, “now I want you to fuck me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hand between her legs started to increase in speed, dipping down occasionally to tease her with the promise of more before drifting back up to continue pleasuring her lightly, causing Agatha to groan and slump even further into Rio’s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Say it again
     </i>
     ,” Rio ordered, voice only a few octaves above a growl, “
     <i>
      say it again, Agatha
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shuddered, bracing herself for the onslaught they were on the precipice of and arched her hips to give Rio a better angle, “Fuck me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once uttered, those words acted like a greenlight to Rio’s passion. Without pause, she gripped Agatha’s hip with one hand and drove two fingers inside of her, causing Agatha to groan needily the moment she, at last, felt her wife inside her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Fucking hell Rio
     </i>
     ,” she ground out as Rio slid them back out slightly, only to drive them back in again, before falling into a hard, rhythm that made Agatha’s eyes roll backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nuzzled her face into the side of Agatha’s throat, pressing open mouthed kisses up and down the flushed skin of her throat as she fucked her against the vanity, causing the bottles of lotion and perfume to topple over onto the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're so beautiful," Rio murmured into her ear as she lifted her other hand to palm at her breast, "you're so lovely, so beautiful". It was an never-ending flow of loving compliments, each one making Agatha sigh or gasp with satisfaction as Rio started to rub at her clit with her thumb, making sparks burst behind her eyes as she continued to fuck her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Considering the entire time they were on The Road Agatha was basically being edged by their ongoing flirtations, not to mention her year of celibacy as Agnes, it didn’t surprise her that she came quickly. Or that she came hard against Rio’s fingers with a husky groan, her knees shaking beneath her and the muscles throughout her body twitching and tensing, as pleasure rippled through her in great big waves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s fingers stilled before withdrawing, although she kept them tucked beneath Agatha’s underwear still, with her face hidden in the warm cove between Agatha’s throat and shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tension in Rio’s body became apparent then, primarily because the stiff way she was holding herself was in complete opposition to the relaxed state of Agatha's own posture, which was light and lazy after an especially strong, exceptionally good orgasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” Agatha said, trying to gain her attention and prompt her to untuck her face from the depths of Agatha’s hair, “Rio, sweetheart”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hand on her hip hadn’t loosened its grip, as though Rio was afraid Agatha was going to be tugged away from her at any moment. So, deciding she needed to tread carefully for once, Agatha span in her arms until they were facing one another and brought both her hands up to cup Rio’s jaw, tilting it up so she could see her expression more clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio allowed her chin to be moved, but she kept her eyes downcast, staring at Agatha’s throat as though yearning to return to her previous hiding place.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was clear that Rio was expecting the worse, or at least expecting the reaction she had received over the past couple of centuries whenever Agatha had given in to her desperate attraction for her wife and they had fallen back into bed with one another. Which was at best, Agatha silently exiting the room and running for the hills. Or at worst, Agatha throwing things at her head whilst sobbing and screaming at her to get out, that she never wanted her to touch her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hesitation on Rio’s face, mixed heavily with the melancholy of acceptance, and a strong sense of bracing against an oncoming storm broke her heart, and she felt it was high time to explain to her wife exactly what had passed through her mind since her memories had been returned to her. Which was, put simply, wilting at even the notion of living without her again and feeling dread at the thought of having to pretend she didn’t love her as desperately as she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I remember it all,” Agatha said quietly, struggling to find the right words to convey her feelings before deciding to simply go for it and hope Rio eventually understood what it was she was trying to say. “I remember falling in love with you, I remember marrying you, I remember our child”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio flinched then and tried to take a step backwards, obviously expecting Agatha’s words to segue into an argument or a verbal lashing. But Agatha didn’t let her slip away, instead she spun them around slowly, so Rio was once more pressed against the vanity and then repeated Rio’s earlier actions of gripping her by the back of her legs and lifting her up to sit upon the dressing table.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was still holding herself tightly, too tightly in Agatha’s opinion, so she slipped her hands down and pressed them into the meat of Rio’s inner thighs, pushing them apart to provide a perfect nook for herself to rest whilst they had this conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I remember what you did, I remember how it felt when you took him; how my heart shattered and bled until there was nothing left but the debris of my life to weigh me down and drown me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head, bowing her head to stare at her own lap, obviously finding it easier to bear this conversation without staring into her eyes. Agatha needed to see her though, so she hooked her finger under her chin and made her look up again as Agatha's lips tugged upwards into a small smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “just listen to me alright, for a few moments longer”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio paused, her uncertain gaze flickering across Agatha’s face trying to source a fallacy in her words or expression. On finding nothing, she nodded once, still looking unsure.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I remember hating you, I remember wanting to hurt you; as much as you hurt me. I remember hunting for the Darkhold and hiding myself with it, hoping that by losing me you might know what it felt like to lose him”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I
     <i>
      did
     </i>
     lose him,” Rio shot back, voice raw and eyes now wet.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know,” Agatha sighed tiredly, “I know you did sweetheart, but I was blinded by grief; made feral and crueller by it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, once again falling into their old patterns of blame and self-defence, tried to stand, “if you want me to sit here and listen to how I ruined us again, I won’t do it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held her down with both hands by gripping her waist and she continued speaking even as Rio tried to wriggle away, trying to break free, “I remember the hex, I remember you finding me when the Darkhold’s power wavered. I remember being so fucking tempted by you, by everything you made me feel in that damn fake show Wanda insisted on producing”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio drew still and sat back slightly, her mouth falling into a small surprised ‘
     <i>
      o
     </i>
     ’ at Agatha’s confession.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I remember that year as Agnes. I remember her wanting you...” her fingers tensed on Rio’s waist, digging in with gluttonous desire, “...wanting you so badly that she used to lay awake at night touching herself to thoughts of you; you mowing the lawn, you cleaning the dishes, watching television with her”. Agatha chuckled with dark amusement, “you were Agnes’s very own torture device sweetheart, Wanda didn’t even have to make you up to inflict that very specific brand of torment on me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A small smirk blossomed on Rio’s face at that particular admission, as her dark eyes dragged down Agatha’s face to rest on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I remember you breaking me out, going through every damn fantasy my hexed consciousness could conceive of, slipping into the fabric of my mind and trying to draw me out so gently”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed and closed her eyes, evidently reliving those tense few months. Her eyes flickered open the moment Agatha continued speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I remember The Road, even when I didn’t know you. I remember thinking how you were the first person in centuries I truly liked, who I actually found interesting, who I wanted to spend time with just for the sake of being with another person. I remember delighting in you, in how clearly you adored causing chaos and strife as much as I did”.
    </p>
    <p>
     A single tear fell from Rio’s eyelashes, dropping to glide down her cheek. Agatha wiped it away with a gentle swipe of her thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I remember getting my memories back, of reliving our story again as though three-hundred-year-old memories had only just happened. I remember standing there opposite you tonight, watching you help save Billy’s life, tempting both fate and the universe’s temper's to help me, to help us save him”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What can I say, Lilia is a very persuasive witch,” Rio joked quietly, even though Agatha could see she was bracing herself for the punchline.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And the funny thing is, I remember all of it. I can remember every moment that has ever happened between us. I remember your laughter, I remember your tears, I remember your grief, and your joy, but there is one thing I can’t seem to recall. Something that for so long felt like one of the most important things in the world to me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyebrows drew together into a concerned frown, “do you know what it is? Maybe the hex takes time to wear off completely?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled, a devilish grin as she started to draw Rio’s robes upward, revealing tempting swathes of tanned thigh, “ah, see here’s the thing, I know precisely what it is I can’t remember. But I also, don’t want to remember it either, it’s something I’ve decided to leave behind… on The Road maybe, for the next witch to trip over”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s frown deepened, even as her eyes glazed and dipped down to watch Agatha’s hands roaming over her bare thighs, before they started to drift up even higher, heading towards the crux between her legs with teasing slowness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And- and what is it?” She asked, stumbling over her words slightly the moment Agatha’s fingers found the edge of her underwear and shifted it sideways, exposing her to Agatha’s hungry gaze and the moonlight streaming through the window behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s simple really. I’ve forgotten how to live without you sweetheart, I don’t remember a thing about it, nor do I want to”. Agatha explained, voice certain and smug as she slowly dropped to her knees between Rio’s legs and started to press kiss after kiss along the hot skin of her left thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio jolted, whether at the feeling of Agatha’s lips upon her flesh or at the revelation, one Agatha knew she had been hoping to hear for centuries, she couldn’t be completely sure.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Rio hissed out as her hands rose to grip fistfuls of Agatha’s hair. However, before Agatha could place her mouth exactly where she needed to, Rio’s grip tightened, and she dragged Agatha back up so they were face to face once more. Rio’s eyes were wide, desperate, and most endearingly of all, filled to the brim with glowing hope.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t play with me Agatha, do you truly mean that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled softly and leant forward to press a long, lingering kiss to Rio’s mouth. “I do,” she admitted softly, unable to supress the smile that she could feel blossoming on her face, “I love you sweetheart, so fucking much. I don’t want to be without you anymore, I don’t think I could be, if truth be told”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's breath caught as though she had forgotten how to breathe. For one pregnant moment she simply stared at Agatha with desperate hunger, then as though sparked by a volt of electricity she jolted to life and crashed their lips back together, “I love you too, I love you. I don't want to be away from you either, I never have”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed into the kiss, delighting in the moment she felt Rio’s lips stretch into a joyful grin against her own smile, whilst cherishing the intimacy of feeling Rio’s tears on her face from where they were pressed together so tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She drew back slowly and flashed her wife another wild grin as she started to drop down to her knees once more, her eyes dark with promise as she did so. "Will you let me show you how much I love you?” Agatha crooned, pressing even more open-mouthed kisses to Rio’s thighs, “will you let me say thank you for all the help you’ve given me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio, who Agatha knew had always been weak to both her smile and her charms, could do little more than fist her hands in Agatha’s hair, lean back against the mirror still sporting several polaroid's of Rio’s smirk and Agnes’s innocent grin, and sigh with satisfaction and relief. Actually allowing herself, for the first time since Agatha had fled their home and broken her heart three centuries ago, to lie back, to relax, and be soothed by Agatha’s tongue and the knowledge that her wife
     <i>
      remembered
     </i>
     everything about her, that her wife
     <i>
      loved
     </i>
     her dearly, that her wife
     <i>
      wanted
     </i>
     her with her always, and that she always would.

     Chapter Notes

    <blockquote>
     <p>
      My guys, we made it. I am in shock that I wrote a fic this long and actually finished it! But at last it's finally here, the final chapter!
     </p>
     <p>
      This chapter is, to put it plainly, basically fluff. I figured this entire fic has been a rollercoaster of up's and down's with a predominance for angst. So, I wanted to sweeten the happy ending with a chapter of fluff that reflected how I, in a dream world, wanted the show to end.
     </p>
     <p>
      I said in my first ever note for this fic that I needed to exorcise my Agathario demons by writing this, and I think it worked gang. I think writing this long, long story healed me and I hope, ever the optimist, that it helped heal all of you guys who wanted a happy ending for this chaotic pair too.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of course, I would like to once again thank all of you guys who have left the sweetest comments and given kudos. I cherish each comment and appreciate your feedback/support more than I can say. It really does help motivate fic writers, especially when we hit a bit of a slump in a story, so thank you &lt;3
     </p>
     <p>
      And of course, for a final time, I really hope you enjoy! It's been a blast! xoxox

     <b>
      RIO
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     There are still, even up to this point in her long existence, a number of things Rio had never had the opportunity to experience properly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because even though she appeared, for all intents and purposes human, she couldn't actually claim official membership to the human race. Nor did she want to really, for there were several privileges she gained through her status as a primordial entity that she simply wouldn't possess if she could. Not to mention, humanity was well known to be rather...
     <i>
      messy
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     With messy acting as a vague umbrella term to cover a whole host of sins.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio considered these privileges as gifts from the universe. They were rewards from It to her for being it’s ever-faithful servant, a servant who wasn’t restrained or limited by the laws of nature, the way other species and creatures it had crafted from matter were bound.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, when Rio's path first crossed Agatha's, she could finally claim to have experienced a sensation she hadn't yet had the opportunity to, which in this particular case was curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     That same curiosity soon turned into a second thing she hadn’t yet felt until meeting Agatha Harkness:
     <i>
      want
     </i>
     . Want that started to burn like dry kindling held to a naked flame, transforming itself into something uncontrollable that hungered, something that yearned, something that always, always pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
     But even now with countless millennia stacked up behind her the way simple years built up in a mortal life, there was still an abundance of things that humanity experienced every day of their insignificant lives, things that they had no clue Death herself was curious about. Even if it was only a light sort of curiosity to simply
     <i>
      know
     </i>
     what certain things felt like, or how those same things added context and unseen dimensions to a life far shorter than any Rio would ever possess.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hunger, for example. Rio never knew, nor would she, ever know what it was to ache for sustenance. For the very cells in her body to demand the energy from other things, whether it be the meat of another creature or something grown from the earth, deep in the soil or on the branch of a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thirst too, was something she had never felt. Which was admittedly very similar to hunger, but still, it was a more violent yearning, one with a far shorter expiry date if the need remained unmet. Or at least that was what Rio had been led to believe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pain was another. Although, this particular experience existed within more of a grey area for her. She had felt the tickle of pain after all, like when Agatha’s bolt of crackling purple had struck her in the chest. It’s energy had successfully pushed her backwards and burned her skin, yet Rio's magic was of such magnitude that it protected her from ever feeling true physical agony, of knowing the sensation many humans had and would experience over their lives, where their pain was so great they would willingly choose to take Rio’s hand in theirs over continuing through the torment of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tonight however, her mind was drawn to another feeling she had never experienced, or at least never experienced until that very moment in a dark bedroom in Westview, New Jersey.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a feeling she had thought she
     <i>
      might
     </i>
     have felt flashes of in moments of despair or instances of distress. Yet it wasn’t until she lay panting, completely nude, on the bed that had once belonged to Agnes, with all of her limbs and neck limp from overexertion, that she truly understood what humanity meant by the word
     <i>
      exhausted
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     A tired smirk blossomed across her face as she thought of her imaginary checklist, of knowing that this was yet another human experience she could tick off as complete. And she was no less amused by the realisation that once again, Agatha Harkness was entirely responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What’s so funny?” Agatha murmured, brushing kisses against Rio's inner thigh from where she was still situated, laying on her front with her head bracketed by Rio's legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio found the strength to lift her head up and tug a rogue pillow beneath it so she could look down at her wife, who was staring up at her with dark eyes and lips that were now enticingly swollen and shiny.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just that you’ve worn me out,” Rio answered softly, lifting a weakened arm to run through Agatha’s hair, which now appeared even wilder than it normally did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed curiously and pressed a few more kisses to Rio's thigh, “another box ticked on your human-y list, huh?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk blossomed into something endeared, something completely in love, as the realisation Agatha remembered the indulgent list Rio kept for herself settled into her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a humbling, relieved moment. Partially because it reinforced Agatha’s feelings and proved that she knew Rio as well as Rio knew her, but also for the simple fact of Agatha remembering
     <i>
      anything
     </i>
     at all, at the knowledge Agatha’s memories, in all of their messy, painful glory, were indeed back, and that even small, unremarkable things like Rio's silly list were now firmly back within her mind’s reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yep,” Rio said, before sighing in satisfaction as Agatha’s mouth started to wander once more, moving closer and closer to where Rio was still aching, much to Rio’s joyful surprise. Surprise, because although Agatha had always been giving in bed, she had never been quite so persistent or focussed on Rio before, normally as eager to receive as she was to give. Yet, on this particular evening, after uttering the words Rio had been desperate to hear for centuries, Agatha continued to ravish her until she, an entity who wasn’t at all human, understood
     <i>
      exactly
     </i>
     what exhaustion felt like.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was almost as though now Agatha had given herself permission to love Rio once more, she couldn’t stop herself from doing so. Over, and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not that Rio was complaining. Like, at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agatha
     </i>
     ,” Rio groaned when she felt Agatha’s tongue swipe a long, decadent path right between her legs, before she then gripped a fistful of Agatha’s dark, wild hair to hold her close.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t say anything in response, but Rio could feel her wolfish grin brushing against her centre, just as a loud bang resounded from downstairs, followed by the murmur of voices, and a single burst of high-pitched laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scowled and withdrew momentarily to send a heated glare towards the closed door, before promptly turning her attention back to Rio. However, she was once again disrupted from her work by a series of loud bangs pounding on the bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have been in there for
     <i>
      four hours
     </i>
     ,” Jen’s voice came through the door, muffled and annoyed. “The sun has come up, the birds are now chirping, and we are
     <i>
      starving
     </i>
     . Please cease and desist for an hour or two, so the rest of us can eat”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck off Kale,” Agatha yelled back, “you guys eat whatever you want, and I’ll do the same”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cackled loudly at that, loud enough that Jen would be able to hear her amusement through the closed door. Agatha turned to her and shot her a mischievous grin, prompting Rio's already broad smile to widen even further.
    </p>
    <p>
     "
     <i>
      Agatha Harkness!
     </i>
     ” Jen cried out, evidently horrified at her lewd insinuation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “These bitches,” Agatha murmured with an eyeroll, talking over Jen's muffled ranting. She then winked and shot Rio a lascivious smirk as she drawled, “now where were we?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t hear anything else Jen shouted through the door after that, for her one-sided argument was promptly drowned out by the husky groans Agatha was drawing from Rio’s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     Four hours promptly turned into six.
    </p>
    <p>
     It would have been five, but Rio had felt the urgent need to repay her wife’s arduous generosity and didn’t cease or desist until Agatha was flushed pink, panting breathlessly, and damp with sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio crawled up her body, relishing the slide of her skin against Agatha’s to plant a possessive kiss against her lips. Lips that felt far drier than they had a few hours before, promptly reminding Rio that although she didn’t experience things like hunger or thirst, her mortal wife certainly did.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think...” Rio whispered between branding kisses across Agatha’s throat, “...you are in need of some sustenance”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I don’t. I just need you to do that thing with your tongue again," Agatha groaned petulantly, before then groaning again. Although, this time it wasn’t a petulant sound, but rather one of arduous recollection, “fuck, I missed your mouth”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked at her and pressed another soft kiss to her lips, “and you have my mouth, forever. But right now I need to do my duty as your wife and feed you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, although Rio could see the humour in the gesture, before poking a single sharp finger right into Rio’s forehead, “I nearly forgot how attentive you are to my humanly needs". She dragged her hands around to the small of Rio's back and started to gently scratch her nails up the length of her spine, “I can think of something else you can feed me though, something that begins with a P and rhymes with -”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her sentence was cut short by Rio pressing a hand over her mouth, although Rio's amusement at Agatha's determination to stay precisely where they were was promptly evidenced by the deep chuckle that escaped her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on,” Rio drawled, lifting herself up from Agatha’s body so she could grab her by the hand and haul her up. Agatha, ever the helpful witch, went entirely limp and refused to stand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tugged at her for a few more moments before with a faux-aggrieved sigh, she snapped her fingers to transport Agatha with a flash of emerald green smoke, from laying prone on the bed to standing by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s jaw dropped at being magically manhandled, although she quickly caught herself and narrowed her eyes instead, crossing her arms tightly over her chest. Which admittedly, was rather distracting for Rio, considering she was still entirely nude.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How about this…” Rio murmured, sauntering closer to Agatha in order to press her against the wall with the length of her body, “...you come downstairs with me for half an hour to eat some food and have a drink, and afterwards I’ll do that thing with my tongue as many times as you want”.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Agatha’s eyebrow arched with interest as she looped both her arms around Rio’s neck, “as many times as I want?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded before bowing her head beneath Agatha’s jaw to whisper kisses along her throat, “as many times as you want”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused, pretending to consider Rio’s generous offer before sighing loudly, “fine. I’ll bite”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She then clicked her fingers, conjuring silk robes for each of them. A Rich amethyst for herself and a deep emerald green for Rio. Agatha then grabbed her hand and started to drag Rio through the bedroom door and down the stairs, now entirely focussed on meeting Rio’s terms in order to cash in her prize.
    </p>
    <p>
     The murmur of voices could be heard from the lounge, but Agatha swept passed the open doorway, hauling Rio behind her the entire length of the corridor to the kitchen, where a selection of empty pizza boxes stained with grease had been abandoned on the kitchen island.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rifled through them with her free hand, hunting for an uneaten piece, only to come up empty. “
     <i>
      Those bitches
     </i>
     ,” she hissed, before once again dragging Rio after her back towards the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you hags eat all the pizza?” She demanded the moment they crossed the threshold, glaring with narrowed eyes at the small gaggle of witches.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh Agatha, how lovely to see you,” Lilia drawled from the couch, dabbing a napkin to the corner of her mouth as though she were finishing a meal in a five-star restaurant, and not a greasy pizza slice straight out of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t give me that fake sweet shit Calderu,” Agatha snapped, turning her attention to Alice who had smothered a laugh in her elbow at the sight they made in the doorway, each of them flushed, with unmistakable bed hair, and bruises speckling their throats, “something funny to you
     <i>
      Alice
     </i>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh no,” Alice said slowly, dragging her eyes up and down their barely robed figures, “there’s absolutely nothing funny about this”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Funny isn’t the word for it,” Teen said, pulling that universal expression all teenagers managed to adopt when facing the reality the adults they knew actually had sex sometimes, “more like
     <i>
      mortifying
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s alright,” Agatha sniped back, pulling Rio toward the free armchair in the corner where she promptly sat and tugged her down onto her lap with both hands, “we used protection”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen mimed throwing up over the side of the sofa, much to Alice’s amusement who slapped the back of her hand against his shoulder to make him stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We ate all of the pizza,” Lilia advised, ever the voice of reason, “but we can order a few more if you’re hungry?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Er,
     <i>
      duh
     </i>
     ,” Agatha replied, running her fingers through the back of Rio’s hair to untangle the knots she had put in it, “we are as hungry as you guys were
     <i>
      before
     </i>
     you stuffed yourselves stupid… or even more now considering how many calories we just burned fuc-”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay!
     <i>
      Yikes
     </i>
     ,” Jen cut her off quickly, pulling her cell phone out to redial the pizza place in the centre of town, “what do you both want?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Meat-Feast,” Agatha yelled out immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen looked to Rio next, awaiting her order. Rio glanced around, eyes widening slightly for not knowing the correct option to select for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You strike me as a pineapple-on-pizza type,” Billy said, although not at all unkindly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh totally,” Alice agreed, nodding solemnly, almost as though this particular decision would define Rio's character in her mind.
     <i>
      Human's and their strange formalities
     </i>
     , she couldn't help thinking to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged, truly unbothered by whatever pizza she ended up with. She wasn’t hungry after all, like usual. But she still enjoyed the motion of eating, and felt a sudden strong desire to take part in this most human of rituals, especially with these particular humans, her coven.
    </p>
    <p>
     “One meat feast, and one Hawaiian,” Jen repeated and rang the order through, “it will be here in twenty minutes”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned loudly, as though the very thought of waiting for her pizza was beyond arduous, before poking Teen with her bare toes, “get your auntie Agatha a drink won’t you. I’m parched”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get your own drink Agatha,” Jen scolded, standing up to push her leg away from Billy, who laughed at their antics and got to his feet anyway, “what do you want?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked triumphantly at Jen before pointing a single finger at the cabinet set against the back wall, “ol’ Agnes had a bottle of Jack hidden away behind that stack of dusty encyclopaedia's”.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was news to Rio, who turned toward Agatha with an arched eyebrow, “oh she did, did she?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She received a devilish smirk in reply, “you had your secrets sweetheart, and I had mine”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy fetched the bottle and passed it over to Agatha. She took a deep swig before offering it up to Rio, who shook her head in reply. She didn’t see the point in alcohol, she couldn’t really feel the effects of it after all and she didn’t think it tasted all that nice either.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice made grabby hand motions at Agatha who scowled back, but did eventually give the bottle up to be passed around the adults of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Death doesn’t drink?” Lilia commented, taking a ladylike sip of her own after Alice's not quite ladylike one, “I suppose it’s a comfort that you don’t reap under the influence”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nope,” Rio said, leaning back against Agatha who wrapped both arms around her waist and held onto her tightly, whilst leaning closer to rest her chin on Rio’s shoulder. “I can’t get drunk and it tastes grim, so never saw the point”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can’t get drunk?” Teen asked, his voice lilting curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nah,” she confirmed, “don’t know what thirst feels like either”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen stared at her with awed, fascinated eyes for a few moments, before breathing out, “that’s so cool". His eyes flickered then, taking in the entirety of Rio’s face as he started to gear himself up to ask the question she knew he had been dying to since it was revealed she was Death.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wondered if he was going to ask if he could ask the question first, or whether the question itself would escape his mouth like an eager rabbit wriggling free from a snare.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I ask you a question? I don’t want to be rude”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She smirked to herself and nodded her consent to hearing his enquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your face…” he began, evidently unsure of how to phrase his question without saying something offensive, “you can just like…
     <i>
      dissolve
     </i>
     your skin?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure can,” she said, voice deadpan, “I can do this too”. She then morphed her face from the beautiful visage they were all used to into a detailed impression of Edvard Munch’s Scream, including the elongated mouth, deathly pale skin, and white eyes with mere pinpricks for pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of the witches in the room, besides Agatha, reared back in horror as she allowed her face to return to it’s normal façade. she looked round at them all, grinning broadly with wide, mad eyes, “cool, huh?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled huskily from over her shoulder, knowing precisely what face Rio had just shown them all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen was the first to recover from the shock and was quick to lean forward again, now appearing even more intrigued than he had before.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s so
     <i>
      freaky
     </i>
     ,” he laughed, “can you change everything about your face? Like on a whim?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure,” she admitted with another vague shrug of her shoulders for it was true, she could. Yet, ever since their child had been born resembling the face she wore now, the same face Agatha had fallen in love with, she had claimed this particular face as hers to keep forever, “I can do this too”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She blinked and suddenly her hair was platinum blonde. Teen drew in a sharp breath, although this time not from fear, but out of sheer admiration for her ability to gift herself the type of dye-job many women would willingly spend hundreds of dollars on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen whistled appreciatively, “damn, that colour suits you”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice nodded her agreement, looking impressed, “I guess it's true. Blonde’s really do have more fun”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha placed her fingers on Rio's jaw and drew her round to face her so she could see the change properly. By the darkening of her eyes, Rio knew she liked it, “
     <i>
      why
     </i>
     haven’t you done this before? You look…” Her jaw flapped uselessly for a few moments as she tried to find a word that would summarise how good she thought Rio looked. But Rio, who had always preferred her hair brown, like their son, simply smirked, blinked once and turned the blonde strands back to their original dark chestnut.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes narrowed and her mouth opened to argue when she did so, however Rio never got to hear whatever quip she was going to say, for a knock on the door distracted them all from Rio’s demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Pizza!” Agatha cried loudly, before once again lifting a leg to poke Teen with her toes, “be a dear and fetch auntie Agatha and auntie Rio’s pizza’s, won't you. We’re exhausted after all that time we spent-”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And once again, Agatha’s sentence was cut off by a joint cry of horror, as Teen sprung to his feet and sprinted to fetch their pizzas from the delivery guy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked at her wife’s antics, ever amused at Agatha’s ability to sow chaos wherever she was, even here, in the most domestic of settings. She shuddered when Agatha leaned in close to press a long kiss to the side of her neck, before dragging her lips up to whisper even more mischief into Rio’s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Works like a charm, every damn time
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as Rio chomped down on her first slice of pizza, enjoying the sweet tang of pineapple and the satisfying pull of stringy cheese, she couldn’t help but agree.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn’t take them long to eat or drink themselves to satisfaction and predictably, as soon as they had finished their meal Agatha was digging impatient fingers into her waist, hinting very unsubtly that she wanted them to proceed back upstairs and for Rio to make good on her part of their bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned to glance at her from over her shoulder, a wolfish smirk on her face at Agatha’s insistence. Agatha grinned back at her, without any shame nor concern that everyone in the room knew the type of sinful things that were currently on her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, just as Rio was sliding from her lap to lead her back upstairs, the entire house shook and a series of loud bangs echoed through the floor from the basement below.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the hell was that?” Jen asked, eyes wide with concern as Lilia stood and started to drift towards the door that led to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah right on time,” she sighed as though expecting such a moment, which considering Lilia’s talents, she probably was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen, Jen, and Alice immediately followed after her, but Agatha held Rio back and tried to tug her in the other direction towards the stairs, evidently still intent on picking up where they had left off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio allowed herself to be led toward the stairs as a smirk started to blossom across her face at Agatha's impatience, however it soon dropped into a frown when one of her internal threads, the threads that were unique to Death and demanded her attention, started to insist she follow the others down to the basement instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned when she felt Rio’s body halt in place. Her jaw dropped to say something, something undoubtedly snarky and rude, yet the moment she saw Rio’s frown she knew duty was calling out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sighed loudly and dramatically, “even
     <i>
      now?
     </i>
     We can’t even have a day?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled at her softly and brought her wife’s hand to her lips so she could press a kiss to the back of it, “unfortunately death doesn’t wait for anything, not even afternoon tryst’s”.
    </p>
    <p>
     She continued speaking over Agatha’s petulant humph of frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But you’ll be pleased to hear I don’t have to travel far for this one. For whatever... or whoever needs my attention… is currently in your basement”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes widened before immediately narrowing, “my
     <i>
      basement?
     </i>
     ” She said, her voice heavy with disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yep,” Rio confirmed, tugging Agatha after the others toward the stairs that led down into the basement. It was here they found the rest of their coven standing awkwardly around what appeared, to them at least, to be a hovering cloud of fog which had materialised just above the section of floor that had been the entrance to The Road.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew what it was the moment she saw it, and so did Agatha, if the groan of frustration she let out the moment she spotted it from over Rio’s shoulder was any sort of indicator.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh for
     <i>
      fuck sake
     </i>
     , I thought we were done with all of this bullshit,” she groaned out, before storming forward to wave a flippant hand at the cloud, trying to forcefully disperse it back into the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Rio choked on a burst of sudden laughter, “you can’t just...
     <i>
      shoo
     </i>
     her away, you know that”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Ugh
     </i>
     ,” she groused, before turning with the same flapping hand still held out in front of her, although this time it was directed at Rio, “get rid of it”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes at her wife's impatience and stepped closer to the fog. “She’s not an it,” Rio said with an arched look at Agatha, before addressing the fog directly, “are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The fog flickered slightly, as though in response to Rio’s question before it started to shimmer and shift even more so, like static being sped up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Er,” Alice drawled, “can someone fill the rest of us in?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s a ghost,” Rio explained as the haze continued to swirl and crystalise, “I did wonder where she got to”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where
     <i>
      who
     </i>
     got to?” Jen asked pointedly, stepping closer to Rio in order to study the fog and see if she could pick out any identifiable features from it's misty haze.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Billy who stepped forward, having put all of the clues together, “it’s Sharon isn’t it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha frowned at him, “who's Sharon?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s groan of frustration at Agatha was promptly transformed into a gasp when the fog finished swirling, forming into a silvery image of a woman, a short woman with a bob and a large floppy hat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Agnes O'Connor!
     </i>
     ” Mrs Davies cried as she glanced around, first at Agatha, then at the rest of them, “
     <i>
      witch-people!
     </i>
     You’re all here!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What’s up Mrs Davies, it's good to see you,” Alice said politely, even though it was clear she was as perturbed as the others to be facing the ghost of a woman she had recently watched die. Jen stood beside Rio, mouth agape with shock, however she jolted into action the moment Mrs Davies silvery eyes fell upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Er yeah,
     <i>
      totally!
     </i>
     Heey Sharon,” Jen drawled as Lilia gave an airy, unbothered wave, and Agatha forced one of those overtly false grins onto her face as she hissed at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Mrs Hart's ghost?!
     </i>
     ” Agatha exclaimed, pointing a severe finger at Rio, “you disappeared to fetch her when she died! How is she still here?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged, not at all phased by Mrs Davies sudden appearance. This wasn’t her first rodeo after all. “She freaked out the moment she realised she was dead, and then went full spectral before I could grab her”. She shrugged again and peered at Agatha over her shoulder. “I knew she’d turn up at some point, her soul couldn’t stay on The Road forever. She was probably spat out the same time as us, the moment Billy’s hex failed”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched Agatha’s face scrunch up tightly into a cringing expression. “What?” She asked, not sure what she had said that she shouldn’t have, “what did I say?”
    </p>
    <p>
     But her error immediately became clear the moment Jen grabbed Rio’s arm and pulled her round to face her, her eyes wide with alarm, “
     <i>
      Billy’s hex?!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Oh
     </i>
     ,” Rio drawled, glancing back at Agatha, who had slapped her forehead with the palm of her hand, “they didn’t know”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nope,” Agatha ground out, “none of them did”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      My hex?
     </i>
     ” Billy asked, voice pitched up nervously, “what do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced between Agatha and Teen, expecting her to explain. Which she did, after a long sigh and a moment of muttering beneath her breath about Rio and her big mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The Road. It’s a hex. Yours to be precise," she told him abruptly, crossing one arm over her chest and bringing her other hand up to fiddle with the locket around her throat. “Your magic… it created the entire thing," she shrugged nonchalantly, "you know, mother like son and all that”.
    </p>
    <p>
     He paled and stumbled back slightly, bracing himself against the wall of the basement. "No,” he mumbled glaring at the floor before lifting his gaze to stare at Agatha with realised horror, “no, it can’t be! I would have
     <i>
      known!
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugged at him again, although this time the gesture wasn’t flippant, it was accepting. “It can happen Teen. Young witches who don't realise their own power. Especially with your specific brand of chaos magic, it’s… well, it’s incredible really”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tears started to well in his eyes, “but that would mean…” he pointed at Sharon and his expression crumpled, “it means I killed her, I killed Sharon”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sharon, who had been flickering in and out like static seemed to jolt when her name was mentioned, “oh, I don’t think so honey,” she drawled kindly, “it was that damn wine. Must have been out of date, I swear these grocery store's are getting more and more lazy when it comes down to labelling their produce. It's like a friend of mine, Helen from salsa class, she ate some bad salmon from Walmart. She took one bite and the next morning: dead”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen opened his mouth to argue with the ghostly woman, but Rio caught his eye and shook her head. Sharon wasn’t a witch, she wouldn’t understand the depths of what had happened to her. If Teen were to try and explain, it could make her spirit stubbornly cling around until all of her questions were answered. And Rio didn't want to consider how long that might take. After all, the less ghosts floating around the mortal plain intent on evading Rio, the better.
    </p>
    <p>
     He bit his lip until it paled and nodded back, understanding her silent message. Next, Rio’s eyes drifted to Lilia who also nodded at her once before promptly sweeping towards Teen in a whirl of colourful fabric, efficiently corralling him upstairs in a flurry of maternal concern, “come on Teen, let’s go see if there’s any of Agatha’s pizza left to eat”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This really is so bizarre!” Mrs Davies said as she glanced around at the rest of them, before bringing her transparent hand up to her face, “being dead isn’t at all what I thought it would be like”.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was Rio's cue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sharon?” She asked, voice soft, “are you ready to go?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sharon jerked when Rio spoke, as though she had already started fading away. It was pretty standard for ghosts who weren’t determined to be so to do that, for the moment they calmed down and accepted they were dead the call of the beyond started to draw them home.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ready now?” She repeated, suddenly sounding like a lost child.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded at her and smiled kindly, She was always relieved when a ghost was amicable and willing to go with her, “are you ready to come with me? I can take you to see your mother. Would you like that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs Davies gasped and covered her mouth as her eyes started to glisten with pale, misty tears, “I get to see
     <i>
      my mom?
     </i>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded at her again, and reassured that Mrs Davies wasn't going to disappear on her, she turned toward Agatha knowing she could afford a moment to say goodbye. She drew closer and cupped Agatha’s jaw with her palm, smirking slightly at the way her wife was now staring at her through narrowed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re leaving,” It was a statement, one gilded with clinginess. Clinginess Rio cherished.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am. But it won’t take long,” Rio tilted her head towards Sharon, “she’s ready”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pouted for a moment before rolling her eyes, “fine, go be a wraith”. She grabbed Rio by a fistful of her dark robes, robes she had conjured to flow around her body the moment she knew a soul was in need of her, “but you better hurry back to me".
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned and pressed a lingering kiss to Agatha’s lips, “wild horses couldn’t stop me”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, yeah,” Agatha droned at Rio’s smooth-talking. Although, the small smile that blossomed on her face afterwards gave away her true thoughts on Rio's words of devotion, “go on. Mrs Hart won’t reap herself”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And for the last time, Mrs Davies rolled her eyes at Agatha Harkness and groaned out a frustrated, “it’s
     <i>
      Sharon!
     </i>
     ” She then took Rio’s hand in hers and allowed herself to be led through the veil to a home with a white picket fence, a home where her mother had been waiting for her, a home where her mother met her with open arms, a broad, beaming smile, and cheeks shining with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     XXXXXX
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio found her way home a few hours later, having been delayed by the call of another soul from one town over on her way back.
    </p>
    <p>
     She decided to come in through the front door, just like a human might. There was something so appealingly domestic about it, about returning to this house that she had lived in with Agnes, only now knowing it was Agatha she was returning to.
    </p>
    <p>
     An Agatha who loved her, an Agatha who, if the light shining through the bedroom window was any indication, was still waiting up for Rio to come home.
    </p>
    <p>
     She closed the front door quietly, and just before reaching the bottom of the stairs paused at an unusual noise coming from the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sweeping forward on silent feet, for Rio was Death and had been crafted to creep unheard through the world, she peered inside and was forced to immediately smother a laugh at the sight her eyes landed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia was asleep on the armchair, head tilted back and legs up on coffee table, mouth open and snoring loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice had claimed the couch. Both her arms were thrown above her head, and her face was tucked into the back cushion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teen, being the youngest member of this strange coven that continued to hang around, like a group a stray cats who they had fed a single time and now gathered together everyday expecting more treats, had been demoted to the rug on the floor, on which he was sprawled under a thin blanket, with a decorative couch cushion shoved under his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snorted in amusement and turned silently to head up the stairs. The first bedroom, the one Rio had used during Agatha’s year as Agnes, was closed off from the hallway, the door shut tight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked to herself, sensing a heartbeat from behind the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Obviously Jen had either won a bet, or simply demanded the privilege of her own bedroom. Either could be true.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio considered banging loudly against the wood for a moment, the thought of winding Jen up amusing enough to draw a small chuckle from her throat. However she resisted the urge, for a far more enticing prize was on the horizon, one beckoning her closer by the spill of warm light pouring through a small gap in the doorframe into the hallway, and by the second, far more familiar heartbeat she could hear thrumming peacefully on the second floor of this strange, stolen house.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pushed the door open and stood still for a moment, savouring the scene before her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was asleep too, although she was propped up on the bed by a mass of pillows behind her, still sitting above the covers. Stubborn witch that she was, it was clear that she had been intent on staying awake until Rio came home. But her fatigue, which was entirely justifiable following their adventures on The Road, battling the remaining members of the Salem Seven, and having her memories returned to her mind rather forcefully, had evidently won the war and she had nodded off.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was still wrapped in the robe she had spelled to appear earlier on in the day, with only a thin blanket thrown over the top of her bare legs to keep the worst of the chill off. An old spell book was resting in her lap, still open on the page she had been reading when sleep had finally managed to claim her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stepped quietly into the room and closed the door behind her, unwilling to remove her eyes from Agatha as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
     For this image, this homely scene that she had returned to, was all she had craved for as long as she had known what the sensation of craving even felt like.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a picture she had born witness to before, although it was a fair statement to claim that although the witch at it’s centre hadn’t changed all that much, the environment that surrounded her certainly had.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before it had been wooden walls, a simple mattress stuffed with straw, the smell of woodsmoke, and the glow of candlelight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now it was thick carpet, Egyptian cotton sheets, cheap artwork on the walls, and the gentle hum of electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though it was still, as it had been then, the most beautiful thing Rio had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio had seen the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Silently, so as to not disturb her, Rio waved a single hand down herself, transforming her dark robes of duty and death into a robe of emerald green, the same one Agatha had conjured for her earlier that day.
    </p>
    <p>
     On silent feet, she padded round to Agatha’s side first. She put her book on the bedside table, switched off the lamp, and tugged the covers out from beneath her legs to cover her with them properly, before moving around the bed to her own side, where she also slid under the thick duvet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rolling over, she wrapped her arm around Agatha’s waist and pulled. Gently, she tugged her further down the bed so her head would rest on Rio’s shoulder and not on the stack of pillows she had been resting against before.
    </p>
    <p>
     She closed her eyes, hopeful Agatha would remain undisturbed and reclaim some of the sleep Rio knew she was in dire need of. Yet, she knew her wife had woken up the moment she felt her stretch languidly beside her and tightly grab a fistful of Rio’s collar, keeping her close.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re here,” was mumbled tiredly against the skin of her throat, her breath a gentle flutter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am,” Rio whispered back, pulling Agatha even closer with the arm she was using to support her wife's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was waiting for you,” Agatha sighed out, stretching a second time before, as though she had never awoken, she was suddenly asleep again; her body growing relaxed beside Rio's, slumping into her slightly as her breathing deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio, suddenly taken aback and deeply moved by the reality of
     <i>
      finally
     </i>
     being here, with Agatha, at feeling the warmth of her body against her own, of her heartbeat thrumming beneath her ribs, and the gentle inhalation and exhalation of her chest, Rio couldn’t help but grin to herself, a broad beaming smile that almost seemed to glow in the shadows of the dark, still night.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was waiting for you too sweetheart, for a long time,” Rio admitted quietly, pressing her lips to Agatha’s forehead. She then finally allowed her body to relax into the soft mattress beneath her, and the soft body beside her, “but we’re here now, where we should be. Together”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And even though Agatha had fallen asleep, she still snuggled closer to Rio as though she had heard her declaration and was responding to it. Her fist tightened even more around her handful of Rio’s robes, and she mumbled two words into the skin of Rio’s throat, two words that made Rio’s loving smile bloom all the brighter, and tears of relief fall from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <i>
      Missed you
     </i>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pressed another kiss to her wife’s forehead, knowing that Agatha’s subconscious confession didn’t just mean the few hours they had been separated that very evening, but rather a far larger timespan, entire lifetimes even.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I missed you too, my love. So much," she brought her hand up and pushed a wayward lock of Agatha’s wild hair back from her face, “sleep now. I’ll be here in the morning, and every day after. I promise”.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Death, as she did with all things, kept her word to her wife, who slept peacefully in her arms that night, and every night after too.
