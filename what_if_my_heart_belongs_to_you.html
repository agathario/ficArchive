<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Her head whipped around, and she was met with the brownest eyes she had ever seen. People said brown was a basic eye color, but Agatha thought if they would take one look into <i>these eyes<i>, they would fall to their knees begging for forgiveness for ever daring to utter such words.</i></i><br/><i><br/><i>For a moment, the world stilled. Which had absolutely nothing to do with the gorgeous woman who seemed to have materialized out of thin air right next to her, no, it must have been some glitch in the cosmos or something.

After all, she is straight, and this blind date is a double date, with a woman being who she's supposed to meet. But when she finds herself face to face with Rio Vidal, the most intriguing person she has ever met, Agathas world is turned upside down.

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Agatha loved Jen. She really did. Sure, they could annoy each other into next week, and nobody was able to rile them up like each other, but at the end of the day, Jennifer Kale was Agathas non biological sister. They had been best friends for decades. In fifth grade, their teacher had decided that it wasn't helpful for the development of their social skills if they sat alone, and had put them next to each other. It took a whole week for them to get over their saltiness about the arrangement - neither of them gave a fuck about the development of their social skills, they were fine by themselves, thank you very much -  but then they realized that while they did dislike every kid in their class, they actually found each other quite tolerable, and when they discovered that disliking their classmates was even more fun when it became a two person activity, the deal was sealed. Agatha and Jennifer truly were a match made in heaven. All throughout highschool, as well as college, all the way to graduation, to their first jobs, their bond remained undeterred. They basically grew up together, being there for each other during challenging times, witnessing each others triumphs and heartbreaks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When they were both 18, after just having started their first semester at college, one night Jen had stumbled into their shared dorm, drunk and in tears. Agatha had sat her down, given her a glass of water and a box of tissues, and was being really selfless about the fact that she had a raging headache, an exam in the morning, and it was almost four am. After Jen had drunk half of the water, accidentally spilled the other half when her drunken ass was having a hard time with spacial awareness and actually grabbing the glass, and gone through almost the entire tissue box, she had looked at Agatha, her face red and tear-stained, and told her that she got kissed at a party by another girl, and that she had liked it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha”, she had whispered, as if sharing an unspeakable secret, “I think I might be a lesbian.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had looked at her with raised brows for about three seconds. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don't say,” she deadpanned, stifling a yawn. “Please tell me she got you pregnant and that's why you're freaking out and you didn't actually drag me out of bed acting like there's an emergency like, idk, the fucking </span>
<em>
<span>building is on fire</span>
</em>
<span>, just to tell me that you're gay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen had looked at her with wide eyes and Agatha realized that maybe her reaction, while genuine (she really could not care less who Jen was attracted to, that didn't change the way she saw her in any way, why would it?), might look a little bit like dismissal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took her friends hands in hers and forced herself to focus. God, she was tired. She'd be way better at this if it was a time she was normally awake at. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm sorry you feel overwhelmed by this, Jen, but I promise you, everything is gonna be okay. This is so not the end of the world, this literally just means you'll never have to live with a man, which is something you should be over the moon about, men are so boring, I don't understand how anyone could be attracted to them and-” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stopped herself. She was steering away from the actual topic. Also, what was she even saying? “I don't understand how anyone could be attracted to them”? For god's sake, she was straight, she was attracted to them. Did she have to remind herself of that every now and then, sure, but it's not like that wasn't normal. Every straight woman probably did. After all, every kiss she had shared with guys so far had been an incredibly mediocre experience. Crazy, how many bad kissers were out there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath. Time to refocus. This was not about her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen, you are a wonderful human being and I love you and so will whatever girl ends up being worth dating you, okay.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her friend sniffled, but the tears had dried. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Agatha,” she said, her voice sincere. Agatha gave her a kind smile and nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anytime. Now, can I </span>
<em>
<span>please</span>
</em>
<span> get back to my lovely, warm bed and get my remaining-” she glanced at the clock “-ugh, two and a half hours of sleep before I have to tackle the absolute </span>
<em>
<span>hell</span>
</em>
<span> this exam is gonna be?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen laughed and nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great. See you tomorrow. I'll take a shower before I head to class, so you better not even </span>
<em>
<span>think</span>
</em>
<span> about occupying the bathroom before 7am, understood?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another nod. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood up to go back to her bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, and Jen?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She flashed her friend a genuine smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me. I'm really proud of you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her smile turned into a wide smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have fun kissing girls.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jens coming out had just brought them closer together, if that was even possible. After confessing to Agatha that night, it hadn't been long until she had no issues fully embracing her queerness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their friendship never wavered, even when they had lived in different places for a while after graduation and didn't get to see each other a lot, their connection remained strong. Now both in their late thirties, they had both found themselves living in the same city again, which was more a coincidence than anything, but a really welcome one. With their apartments being only about fifteen minutes apart, they managed to meet up at least once a week, and Agatha always looked forward to seeing her best friend. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So yes, she loved Jen. She was willing to do a lot for Jen, really, she was…except-</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, nice try, I'll pass.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pleaseeeeee.” Jen was actually whining.. Oh my god.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have some self respect, woman.” Agatha took another sip of her wine before leaning back on her friends couch. They had decided to stay in for their weekly dinner, they've both had a rough week at work and neither of them felt like doing anything besides lounging on the couch in sweatpants and drinking an amount of wine that anyone else might have judged them for, but since neither of them was downing less glasses than the other, there was no room for judgment here. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I've liked her for </span>
<em>
<span>so long</span>
</em>
<span>. You </span>
<em>
<span>know </span>
</em>
<span>that I've liked her for so long, why won't you just do this for me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swirled the wine in her glass. She was gonna need a refill soon. Should she have one? No. But would she?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pleaseeee Agathaaaaa.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, yeah, she most definitely would. With a sigh, she reached for the bottle standing on Jens coffee table next to their empty pizza cartoons neither of them had felt inclined to take to the trash yet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen, my dear Jen,” her voice was dripping with mock exasperation, “you know I love you like a sister, but there are limits to my love for you, and those limits include going on a random blind date just because you and the woman you like can't be adults about your feelings and go on a normal date, </span>
<em>
<span>just the two of you</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>As if to underline her point, she took a sip straight out of the bottle- well, she tried at least. Much to her dismay, she discovered that the bottle was empty. With a dissatisfied grunt, she put it back on the coffee table and turned to face her friend.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, I know you've had a crush on Alice since the day her band played at the opening of your store- which was almost five months ago btw, the fact that you guys have been texting basically nonstop and you're at her gigs like every weekend and you </span>
<em>
<span>still</span>
</em>
<span> haven't actually talked about your feelings is insane…and you know, I am over the moon that she has finally asked you out. But a double date? You guys are literally obsessed with each other, you can't possibly think you'll actually need a buffer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen sighed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know you're right…but this is huge, Agatha. I really like her, and I want this to go well. Bringing our best friends was her idea, and if it makes her more comfortable, I wanna do this for her. Besides, hanging out in a group setting might actually take off the pressure a bit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip. She hated blind dates. Honestly, she wasn't too fond of the concept of dating as a whole. Agatha Harkness didn't do relationships, Agatha Harkness met guys in bars, had a fun night out, then went back to their place, had a, well… more or less fun night in, and then moved on. So far, it had worked out for her. And if she sometimes felt lonely, well, that was nobodys business. Besides, she was just fine. She had Jen, she had her other friends, and she wasn't even living alone- she had Scratchy, who, yes, was a rabbit- but hey, he was a great listener! </span>
</p><p>
<span>As if Jen had been reading her thoughts, she started talking again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Honestly don't even look at it like an actual date for you. Seriously, that's not what I'm asking of you. Just…getting to know a nice woman and hanging out with your best friend and her hopefully future wife. You literally never have to see her again, if you don't click with her. But Alice said she's really great. They've been best friends for years, just like us, and-” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jennifer Kale,” Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, “did I just hear you genuinely suggest me going on a date with a </span>
<em>
<span>woman</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen gave her an apologetic smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know you're straight. And don't worry, so does Alice, and her friend knows too. I told you not to see it as an actual date. It's more like… a date for Alice and me, and our friends are like, well, there, too, and under different circumstances, this might look like a double date, but if you think about it, it's really not, and-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh, fine,” Agatha interjected, mainly because her head was starting to hurt and she </span>
<em>
<span>really, really </span>
</em>
<span>needed Jen to stop whining. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The other woman squealed and immediately picked up her phone from the coffee table, presumably to text Alice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you thank you thank you! You're the best friend in the whole entire world!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mhmm,” Agatha grumbled. “You're paying by the way. And there better be alcohol.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Less than a week later, Agatha was looking herself up and down in the mirror. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you think, Scratchy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her rabbit was perched on her bed behind her, intently watching as she took off the dress she was wearing and carelessly threw it behind her on the growing pile of discarded clothes on her bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There is literally not a single reason I need to be overthinking this.” With a sigh, Agatha picked up her black robe with the intricate flower patterns sewn on it and sunk on the bed next to her pet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm literally never gonna see this woman again after tonight. And it's not even an actual date. I'm basically just babysitting Jen, who apparently lacks the maturity to attend her dates alone..” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Absentmindedly, she stroked the rabbits fur. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Scratchy,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let a few more seconds pass, before she made a decision. Like she said, there was no reason to overthink this. It was just a casual dinner with her best friend, the woman she liked, and some woman that was kinda Agathas date, but wasn't really, because, once again, Agatha didn't date. Oh, and she was not interested in women. At all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely no reason to overthink this.” She repeated it like a mantra as she got up and moved back to her closet. A few minutes later, she was wearing her favorite outfit- rich purple slacks and a white blouse tucked neatly into the waistband. She was gonna pair it with her signature blue coat, and obviously she couldn't forget her locket. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After a glance in the mirror, she turned to her rabbit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you say, Scratchy? Not too bad, hmm?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As always, the pet exercised his right to not provide any comments, but Agatha was sure he was agreeing with her. Duh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When it was time to leave the house and get in the uber she had ordered, Agatha felt good. She got this. She was Agatha Harkness, for god's sake. Everything was gonna be just fine. She was gonna attend this dinner, let Jen and Alice have their fun, engage in some polite small talk with Alices friend, and then go home and pat herself on the shoulder for being such a good friend. That was how this was gonna go. Everything was just fine. </span>

<p>
<span>Agatha reached for her phone that had informed her with a little </span>
<em>
<span>ding</span>
</em>
<span> that she had a new message.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She texted me she's gonna pick me up!!!!!!!!!!!!</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Okay, this amount of exclamation marks was ridiculous. Was Jen a woman pushing forty or a teenager with a crush?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another </span>
<em>
<span>ding</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I can see her through the window coming up to the door and she actually brought me flowers!!!! OMG!!!!!!! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alright, teenager with a crush it was. Agatha sighed. She was happy for her best friend, she really was. Jen deserved to find love. But god, Agatha sure could do with being a little less…involved in the whole thing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The restaurant they were gonna meet at was all the way across town. Agatha leaned back in the seat of the uber and closed her eyes. This promised to be a long evening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When she arrived at the restaurant, Jen had just shot her a message (thankfully in a more calm tone, and without an insane amount of exclamation marks) informing her that they had just left. At least she had the decency to apologize that the people </span>
<em>
<span>whose date this was actually supposed to be</span>
</em>
<span> were gonna be the ones arriving late. Agatha felt absolutely zero inclination to wait in the cold fall weather, so she entered the restaurant. They wanted to be late, fine. Time for her to get a headstart on drinking. She just hoped Alices friend was taking after Alice and would arrive late, so Agatha could have a few minutes to herself and not be forced to engage in awkward small talk already. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good evening, Miss,” the waiter standing by the door greeted her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave him a polite nod. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good evening. There should be a reservation under…” She wracked her brain trying to remember Alices last name. Jen had told it to her, obviously, but to Agathas defense, Jen was telling her a million facts about Alice all the time, every day. Agatha knew that Alices favorite color was orange and she used to have a pony when she was a kid. The pony was named Sally. Now why the fuck could she remember those useless pieces of information but not the one thing that actually mattered right now. God, it really wouldn't hurt if Jen shut up every once in a while. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It's a double name…Multiple syllables…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The waiter looked at her in confusion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don't know the name your reservation is under?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grew impatient.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I'm obviously not the one who made the reservation, am I. You see, my friend is supposed to be on a date here tonight and the reservation is under her dates name, and they were both supposed to be here already, but I guess they fucked on top of the flowers she brought her, so now they're late, and it's really cold out, and I would really appreciate it, if you could just check the reservations and, i don't know, read all the double names out to me, I'll recognize it if I hear it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The waiter looked at her like she was insane. Okay, maybe the flower part was a bit unnecessary. Agatha sighed, ready to admit her defeat and accept her fate of waiting in the biting cold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wu-Gulliver.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her head whipped around, and she was met with the brownest eyes she had ever seen. People said brown was a basic eye color, but Agatha thought if they would take one look into </span>
<em>
<span>these eyes</span>
</em>
<span>, they would fall to their knees begging for forgiveness for ever daring to utter such words. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, the world stilled. Which had absolutely nothing to do with the gorgeous woman who seemed to have materialized out of thin air right next to her, no, it must have been some glitch in the cosmos or something. Obviously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman spoke again, and the world resumed its turning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The reservation should be under the name Wu-Gulliver. The rest of the party will be here soon, but if you could show us to the table, that would be lovely.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She flashed a smile at the waiter, who nodded, seemingly relieved to not have to deal with Agatha anymore, and gestured for both of them to follow him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They ended up at at a somewhat secluded table for four at the far end of the restaurant. The waiter had lit the candle standing in the middle of the wooden table, put down four menus, and vanished, after giving Rio a polite smile, and Agatha a stiff nod. Agatha rolled her eyes. Men could be so difficult.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” the woman pulled out one of the chairs and gestured for Agatha to sit down. The simple action startled Agatha so much that she couldn't do anything but slide in the seat offered to her. Just a second later, the chair next to her got occupied as well. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're sitting…next to me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha briefly questioned why the thought of being this close to this woman for the next couple hours made heat rise in her chest, but quickly dismissed it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her question was met with a chuckle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, if that's okay with you? I just assumed the two lovebirds would wanna sit together.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>That actually was a good thought. Agatha shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine, whatever.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Another chuckle. God, was this woman on drugs or just naturally…in a good mood? She wasn't even sure what would be worse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You seem excited to be here.” The sarcasm was dripping from the words, but there was no malice in the womans tone. “Is this how you usually are on dates?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something snapped in Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I know you know that I'm straight, so you should be aware that this isn't an actual date. I'm here because Jen can be annoyingly persistent, and that's it. I promise you, I'm so not here for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dang,” she laughed, “way to make a girl feel special.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm not here to make you feel special,” Agatha shot back. The other woman held up her hands in mock surrender. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, I was just joking. I'm sorry, okay. No date for us, I got it, don't worry. Let's just enjoy the evening, alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a breath and opened her mouth, but she didn't get a chance to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As friends, or platonic acquaintances who literally just met, don't worry. You can trust me that I got the message, don't spiral, okay.” She gave Agatha a genuine smile, and Agatha felt herself relax at least a little. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A mischievous sparkle appeared in Rios eyes and in a teasing tone she said “you do seem awfully persistent on letting me know you're not into women, do you think lesbians are incapable of taking a hint?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something reacted in Agathas body as she heard the other woman refer to herself as a lesbian so easily. Like it wasn't a big deal. Like it was the most normal thing in the world. Agatha had absolutely zero issues with gay people, hell, her best friend was a lesbian as well, and Agatha truly didn't care who other people were attracted to. It didn't change how she viewed them whatsoever, and she knew for a fact that she carried none of the hatred that her mother had for the LGBTQ+ community in her. But still… something about the way she heard the other woman use that word so easily, so confident… it stirred something in Agatha. For a second, it felt like envy, jealousy about the fact that she was able to call herself that with such ease, before Agatha realized that that was an insane thought to have, and obviously it held no weight. Zero. None at all whatsoever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thankfully, the woman beside her seemed ready to change the topic. She formally outstretched her hand, which put her arm in an awkward angle as she was sitting so close to Agatha. She seemed undeterred though, as a bright smile appeared on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I haven't even introduced myself yet, I'm so sorry. Hey, what's up, I'm Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha attempted to shake Rios hand, which must've looked ridiculous from the outside given they were, once again, already sitting so close. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” she managed to say. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I know,” Rio answered, “Alice already told me. I like your name, it's so pretty. It suits you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blamed the blush rising in her cheeks on the temperature in the restaurant. What other explanation could there possibly be?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could come up with an answer, they got interrupted by voices calling their names. The latecomers were approaching the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After hugs and greetings were exchanged, and the two had taken their seats across from Agatha and Rio, Alice apologized for their late arrival. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, it's fine.” A mischievous grin was spreading across Rios face and she gave a quick sideways glance to Agatha. “This one already came up with a pretty good explanation as to what kept you away. Apparently it included… certain adult activities? And… plants?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen and Alice were a picture of complete and utter confusion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Literally what are you even talking about?” Jen asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, nothing.” Rios grin somehow became even bigger. A second passes and apparently, she couldn't hold it in anymore as it burst out of her, “Agatha told the waiter you guys fucked on the flowers Alice brought Jen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha immediately turned to Rio and smacked her arm. “Fuck you! You heard that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whoaa, language,” Rio said in mock offense, while making a point of rubbing her arm. This bitch. Agatha knew she hadn't hit her hard, it couldn't actually be hurting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, Agatha.” Jen buried her face in her hands. “You're unbelievable. We didn't do… that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, just something kinda going in that direction”, Alice mumbled, while flipping through the menu. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You guys,” Rio exclaimed, “unholy activities before the first official date? Shame!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her and Agatha were laughing tears, while the other two just rolled their eyes and were suddenly </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> interested in what their menus said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The evening actually progressed really well. Agatha could feel herself relax more and more as time went on, laughing, sharing anecdotes, and engaging in a very entertaining battle with Rio on who could tease their friends more. At first, she almost felt bad, but she knew the two women knew that her and Rio didn't actually mean any harm, and to be fair, it was just too easy to make them blush. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time the desserts came, Jen and Alice looked like they were in their own little world. Their gazes were locked onto each other, their hands were laying intertwined on the table, and every once in a while, one of them would whisper something to the other, and they would giggle like highschool girls in love. It was sickening, it was adorable. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, it looks like the date is going well for them.” Rio had leaned over and spoke softly to Agatha, as to not disturb the two lovebirds across from them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried her best to ignore the way her heartbeat sped up as she felt Rios breath ghost over her skin due to the sudden closeness. She just nodded. When Rio leaned back again, relief washed over her, mixed with a tinge of something that felt scarily close to disappointment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good for them. They look happy.” Agathas voice was a little hoarse when she spoke and she cleared her throat, not sure where this had suddenly come from. God, what was going in with her tonight?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, they do. Really makes up for the fact that </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> date isn't gonna kiss me goodbye later.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was meant as a joke, Agatha could tell Rio said it lightly, and had moved on from it a second later already, digging in the tiramisu in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, this is so good. Seriously, this tastes </span>
<em>
<span>heavenly</span>
</em>
<span>,” she mumbled with her mouth full. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to move on from the comment as well, knowing it didn't mean anything, knowing Rio respected her not being into women and was just having fun, knowing there was no ill intent behind her words at all. But somehow, it stuck with her, playing in her mind on loop, over and over again, no matter how hard she tried to stop it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A few beats passed. Alice and Jen were still completely entranced with one another, feeding each other chocolate lava cake, laughing and talking, while Rio kept going on about her tiramisu and how “absolutely fucking amazing” it tasted. Eventually though, she noticed that the woman next to her hadn't said anything in a while and was sitting in her chair like she was frozen in time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, hey, are you good?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The look on Rios face was one of genuine concern, and suddenly, it became all too much. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I…I'm gonna go…go to the bathroom,” she managed to stutter, while already getting up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hurried through the restaurant and into the restrooms in the back. As the door fell shut behind her, the noise from outside got cut off, and Agatha finally felt like she could breathe again. For a moment, she just stood there, looking in the mirror over the sinks. Her face was red and there was a slight sweat film on her skin, making a few strands of her hair stick to her forehead. Her mouth felt dry, and she stepped forward to fill it with a few sips from the tab, not burdening herself too much with concerns about consuming tab water right now. She also splashed some cold water on her face and tried to fix her hair. When she found her appearance to be at least somewhat presentable again, she leaned back at the wall, grateful for the cold tiles anchoring her in the present.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck is going on,” she whispered to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, the door opened and a head peaked in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, is it cool if I come in?” Rios voice was serious but gentle, and Agatha could tell she was genuinely leaving the decision up to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine.” She motioned for the other woman to come in, and she did, slowly closing the door behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just wanted to go check on you. You seemed…like something wasn't right, and I got worried when you hurried off like that.” Rio leaned against the surface holding the sinks across from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm good.” Agathas tone was clipped. “No need to worry.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither of the women spoke, Agatha becoming more and more uneasy, which Rio seemed to catch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” she said, her tone still being so unbelievably gentle, god, why did she have to be so fucking kind? It was confusing, and the fact that it was confusing was even more confusing. Her head started to spin, when Rio continued to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Am I bothering you? You seem to be more stressed than when I first asked to come in here, which is the opposite of what I wanted to achieve by checking on you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath. She felt like Rio deserved honesty. Her voice was more shaky than she would like, and she just hoped that the other woman wouldn't notice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your comment earlier threw me off a bit. It's no big deal, really, I know you didn't mean anything by it, don't worry. I just…needed a moment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>God, she sounded ridiculous, like she was blowing this way out of proportion. Part of her was prepared for Rio to laugh at her, dismiss her, whatever. But none of that happened. Instead, she could almost see the gears in Rios head working, as she was trying to figure out what comment Agatha had meant. It only took her a couple seconds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god.” She sounded genuinely apologetic. “Agatha, hey, I'm so sorry. You're absolutely right, I didn't mean anything by it, but it obviously affected you. I'm really sorry, that was so not my intention. I was just making a dumb joke.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a step in Agathas direction and stilled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm sorry,” she said again, quieter this time, but no less sincere. “I promise, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha almost felt bad for even bringing it up. Rio hadn't technically done anything wrong, yet here she was, standing in front of Agatha, apologizing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A careful smile started to tug at Rios lips, and she titled her head slightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Forgive me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded eagerly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, yes of course. Yes, thank you, yeah, okay.” She stumbled over her words and could feel the heat creeping on her face again. God, why was this happening so much today?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio seemed genuinely relieved. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Cool.” She smiled. “You wanna get back out there?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha nodded again, she swiftly moved ahead of her and opened the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“After you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha really had to do something about this damn blushing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When they left the restaurant, the cold air hit Agatha like a tidal wave. It was only the beginning of october, but the wind was biting. The others seemed to feel similarly, and no one wanted to spend more time than absolutely necessary outside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice and I are gonna head back to my place,” Jen announced, her hands in the pockets of her long pink coat. Agatha noticed, that one of Alices hands was also in the pocket of Jens coat, presumably intertwined with Jens. God, the label “ridiculous but adorable” really was incredibly fitting for them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, have fun you two. Use protection, I'm not ready to be an aunt.” Rio winked at them. Jen rolled her eyes, but Alice just giggled. After they hugged and said their goodbyes, the two women hurried off to get in Jens car that was parked nearby, leaving Rio and Agatha by themselves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm happy for them”, Rio smiled. Agatha could tell she really cared about Alice, and found it strangely endearing. She wanted to ask how they met, how they became friends, she wanted to ask Rio things about herself, she honestly just wanted to hear Rio talk more, and spend more time talking </span>
<em>
<span>to</span>
</em>
<span> her. But it was really fucking cold, and also, she had no business even thinking this. God. 'Wanted to hear her talk more?' Maybe the one glass of wine she had ordered had gotten to her head (“yeah, right, Agatha,” she scolded herself). </span>
</p><p>
<span>She settled for just agreeing with Rio, and went on to say “well, this was fun, but we better get going before we freeze our asses off.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure,” Rio nodded. She gave Agatha a quick hug. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was really nice to meet you. Maybe we'll see each other around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha mumbled, “maybe.” She didn't tell Rio how much she hoped it was true. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Agatha got into bed that night, fresh out of the shower, in her comfy pyjamas and with her heater set on the perfect temperature, her mind drifted back to the evening. It had been fun, more fun than she had expected- well, minus her mini breakdown at Rios comment. Her mind locked on the image of the other woman. She also had not been what Agatha expected. To be fair, she hadn't given her “date” much thought at all, but getting to know Rio might have very well been the highlight of her week. She was funny, eloquent, really smart, and the way she had come looking for Agatha, the way her gente voice had reassured her… A smile tugged on Agathas lips. Yeah, Rio was great. And not to mention, breathtakingly attractive. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Woahh.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat up straight in her bed. Where did that come from? Her mind kept messing with her tonight, it was really unsettling. Time to go to sleep, time to stop thinking. No more dwelling on Rio. She most likely would never even see the woman again anyways.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, Agatha turned off the lamp on her nightstand and sank back in her pillows. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah. She would never see Rio again, and that was probably for the best. Maybe then her mind could stop playing these silly tricks on her. </span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>When Jen turned up to Agathas house the following saturday for their weekly dinner together (which, once again, was gonna take place on a couch in sweatpants), she brought wine, thai food, and news.</p><p>“Alice and I are official,” she exclaimed once they were settled on the couch in Agathas living room, facing each other, the food, bottle of wine, and two glasses on the coffee table next to them. </p><p>A grin spread across Agathas face. Had it only been a week since their “double date”? Sure. But Jen and Alice had been harboring feelings for each other for months, as well as being in basically constant contact. Also, they were lesbians, which in itself was explanation enough. </p><p>“Congrats.” Agatha meant it in sincerity. As much as her and Jen would bicker, tease, and annoy each other, they were sisters, and Agatha truly wanted the best for her.  </p><p>She reached for the bottle and poured them each a glass of red wine, before she handed one to her friend and clinked hers against it. </p><p>“To you and your <em> girlfriend </em>. Finally you got your acts together.” She laughed. “No, seriously though. You deserve this. I'm happy for you.” </p><p>She took a sip of her wine. </p><p>“Thank you.” Jen gave her a genuine smile. “You know, I also wanted to thank you again for agreeing to come to the date. It really did take the pressure off quite a bit and made both Alice and me feel more at ease.” </p><p>Agatha shrugged. </p><p>“It was nothing.” (Which was rich coming from her after throwing a whole tantrum beforehand about not wanting to go. It was also a big, fat lie, as the date not only had her flustered basically all evening, but also left her with some very confusing feelings that seemed to surface whenever she was thinking about a certain woman she had met that evening.)</p><p>“Well, either way, I'm grateful. Hopefully you didn't have too much of an awful time?” Jen leaned back and looked at her friend. </p><p>“It was fine.” Agatha was desperate to change the topic, but before she could come up with something, the other woman was already speaking again. </p><p>“At least I know Rio had fun. Three out of four wouldn't be too bad of a quota anyways, right?” She winked at Agatha and laughed.</p><p>Immediately, Agathas mind went into overdrive. Rio had fun? Did she say that? Did she tell Alice? Why would she do that? Had she been serious? </p><p>She cleared her throat and tried really hard to keep her voice neutral.</p><p>“Did she…uh…did Rio say that?” She even went as far as finishing off with a purposeful yawn, though judging by the way Jen was glancing at her that might have been overkill. </p><p>“I mean, I don't care, duh. It's just… interesting… and I'm interested…in learning about interesting things.” <em> Okay, cool it Harkness, we're definitely in overkill territory now.  </em></p><p>Jen narrowed her eyes. </p><p>“You're being weird. Why?”</p><p>Agatha forced a laugh, but even to her own ears it sounded painful. </p><p>“I'm just making conversation, Jen. Just asking if Rio said she had fun, or where you got that information from, and if she said it, did you hear it? Did it sound sincere? Do you think she actually had fun, and if yes, what do you think was it, <em> specifically </em>, that made the evening fun for her?”</p><p>Jens answer came slow, with a suspicious undertone.</p><p>“Do you… want her to have had fun?” </p><p>“Sure.” Agathas voice was a tad too high. “I mean, I don't care, whatever.” She grabbed the bottle again. “More wine?”</p><p>Her friend didn't answer, just gave a pointed look at her still almost full glass, before she continued to speak.</p><p>“Agatha… do you want to be the reason she had fun?”</p><p>Agathas laugh sounded almost hysterical, she could hear it herself. </p><p>“Now that's just silly, why would you say that?”</p><p>Jen raised her eyebrows. </p><p>“Alright, before you propel yourself into hyperventilation - Alice told me that she called Rio the day after the date and thanked her for coming, and Rio apparently said something along the lines of  'Of course, anytime, you and Jen are so cute together'.” She smiled, before she spoke again. “And then she mentioned that she had a fun evening too, and it was really nice to get to know “Jens friend”. That's it. Does that satisfy your investment in 'interesting things'?” </p><p>Jen made air quotes around the last two words and Agatha lighty shoved her. </p><p>“Do you think her saying 'anytime' means like, anytime Alice wants her to attend a date, or like…anytime it'd be the four of us, like I would also be there, like me <em> specifically </em>?” Agathas voice had gotten faster as she neared the end of her question.</p><p>Jen, who had picked up her wine glass again, stopped mid motion. Her gaze zeroed in on her friend, and her voice had a deeply suspicious edge to it.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said, “I'm going to ask you a question now, and as your sister, you know you can tell me anything, okay? Did you hit your head and are experiencing cognitive deficits, or do you have a crush on Rio?” </p><p>The wine splashing out of Agathas mouth landed on the couch, her sweatpants, and her friends sweatpants. She gasped for air and was promptly sent into a coughing fit. Jen sighed, set her own glass back down, leaned over, and lightly padded Agathas back until she was able to breathe normally again. </p><p>“You literally just spit on me”, she deadpanned, inspecting her pants, whose thighs were now covered with little red wine sprinkles.</p><p>“Well, that's only fair after your insane insinuation.” Agatha still got up and retrieved a fresh dishtowel and a bowl of water. As she worked on getting the stains out of the fabric on her friends legs, she didn't dare look at her. Jen knew her well, probably better than anyone else, and Agatha was afraid of what she might see if she looked into her eyes right now. <em> Not that there was anything to see. Obviously. But a woman could never be too careful, right? </em></p><p> </p><p>☆</p><p> </p><p>That night, Agatha was laying awake staring at her ceiling in the dark. She was tossing and turning, unable to turn off her mind, no matter how hard she tried. Her friend was insane. Suggesting that she had a crush on Rio? Excuse her? That was crazy. Jen knew that Agatha was straight. And she<em> was </em>. 100%.</p><p>Sure, she could appreciate a beautiful woman when she saw one. Sure, the thought of kissing a woman might have crossed her mind a couple times. But all that was normal, right? It was just something everyone felt every now and then. It wasn't a big deal. </p><p>So what if she never genuinely felt a connection with any of the men she's been with? That wasn't for lack of attraction to their gender as a whole, it couldn't be. It wasn't her fault none of these men were right for her. Dating was overrated anyways. Hell, she has had more fun with Rio that night than on any actual date she's ever been on (which, to be fair, wasn't a lot, her not-being-a-fan-of-dating-phase had been going on for a <em> while </em>), but that didn't mean anything besides confirmation that the guys she had been with so far had sucked at dating, right?</p><p>Agatha groaned. A glance at her phone told her it was almost two in the morning. Great. Well, this was one persons fault, and one persons only.</p><p>“Agatha? What's wrong? Are you okay?” </p><p>Jen sounded incredibly tired, but the worry and fear in her voice were unmistakable. For a split second, Agatha almost felt bad for calling her in the middle of the night. </p><p>“No, I'm not okay. You completely fucked with my head. I can't sleep, and it's all your damn fault.”</p><p>“Literally what are you even talking about right now?” The worry in her friends voice shifted into annoyance.</p><p>“'Do you have a crush on Rio?'” Agatha repeated Jens words from earlier. “You know I'm straight, Jennifer, why would you even say such a thing?”</p><p>“Damn, using my whole name.” Jennifers voice sounded amused, before she seemed to remember that she was annoyed. </p><p>“Agatha Harkness, please tell me there's an actual emergency going on besides you freaking out over some comment I made.”</p><p>“Did you not hear me? I can't sleep, and I keep having these weird thoughts, and it's all your fault!” </p><p>“It is two in the morning, you crazy woman. This couldn't have waited until an acceptable time to be awake? You know I need my beauty sleep!”</p><p>“Well, if you remember, you woke me up in the middle of the night before, when you were having your whole gay crisis, and I was there for you” Agatha snapped back, referring to the night in college when Jen had come out to her during her little breakdown. </p><p>A second passed. Then another second. Agatha wondered if her friend had fallen asleep. Just as she got ready to yell into the phone, Jen spoke again.</p><p>“Yes, I remember. And now…the roles are reversed?” She formulated it as a question, but even so, the weight of the insinuation hit Agatha like a tidal wave. </p><p>“I'm not having a gay crisis,” she retorted, but even to her own ears, it sounded weak.</p><p>“Hey.” Jennifers voice was soft. “Why don't you try to get some sleep, hmm? You don't have to figure it out tonight. Just… get some rest and call me tomorrow, we'll figure this out, alright? Don't worry.” </p><p>Agatha took a deep breath. She felt her eyelids becoming heavy, but the nervous energy never left. </p><p>“I can try,” she mumbled. </p><p>“Okay,” Jen responded. “Try not to drive yourself too crazy, okay? I'll talk to you tomorrow.”</p><p>A beat. </p><p>“Oh, and Agatha?” </p><p>She could almost hear her friends smirk over the phone.</p><p>“Kissing girls <em> is </em> fun.”</p><p>Agathas last conscious thought before she slipped into the warm embrace of sleep was the realization that Jennifer had referenced what she had told her all those years ago, the night she told Agatha that she was a lesbian.</p><p> </p><p>☆</p><p> </p><p>The call with Jen the next day didn't really help soothe Agatha. Her mind was still running on overdrive, conjuring up images of Rio, making her relive being all flustered around the woman all evening, all accompanied by Jens voice in her head, asking her over and over again if she had a crush on Rio. </p><p>By sunday evening, she was so worked up, that she decided to go on a run, something she hadn't done in ages, but all the adrenaline in her body had to go towards something, and she felt like her wine consumption lately was already at a level that didn't need to grow any higher. </p><p>So, ten minutes later, Agatha was jogging down the streets, earbuds in, her phone in her hand, some spotify-curated hype playlist playing on full volume. The first few minutes, she still felt tense, but after leaving the buzz of the city behind and entering a quieter part of the park near her house, she could almost feel the gears in her head slowing down. It was cold, but the wind in her face and her hair made her feel alive, and the smells of fall around her released a shit ton of dopamine in her. </p><p>She was good. This was good. She just needed to get out more, maybe that was it. Yeah, she had been too cooped up in her apartment and at work, she needed to make time to leave the house and move her body. This was already helping. Agatha almost laughed at herself for losing her mind so much about that ridiculous comment. A crush on Rio? Another woman? Please. </p><p>She closed her eyes as she kept speeding up. Nobody was around, it was just her, just her outside, running, sprinting, feeling alive, being alive- </p><p>“Ouch, fuck, I-” Agathas eyes snapped open as she collided with another body. Her phone fell to the ground, but before she could pick it up, she realized who she had bumped into, and her entire body froze up.</p><p>“Oh hey”, Rio smiled at her while rubbing her side. As she hit a specific spot, a painful groan fell from her lips. </p><p>“Ouch, okay, you really got me there. Were you trying to kill me or is shoving people just part of your workout routine?” </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. </p><p>“I didn't see you, my eyes were closed. I'm sorry though, I didn't mean to hurt you.” She took her earbuds out and put them in the pocket of her hoodie.</p><p>“It's all good.” Judging by the look of pain on Rios face, it was in fact not all good, but before Agatha could say anything, Rio grinned at her.</p><p>“Why were you running with your eyes closed? Do you have a deathwish?”</p><p>“Hey!” Now Agatha was firing back. “You're the one who was actually able to see her surroundings, why didn't you just step aside?”</p><p>Rio actually had the audacity to laugh, and her laugh had the audacity to somehow be the sweetest sound that had ever hit Agathas ears. </p><p>“Agatha, you were basically running zigzag. I tried getting out of your way, I really did, but you were quite speedy there, and running with your eyes closed really affected your direction control skills. Be happy you ran into me and didn't hit a whole tree or something.”</p><p>“Oh, I'm about to cry tears of gratitude,” Agatha deadpanned. Rio just laughed again, before gripping her yet again, her face scrunched up in agony. </p><p>Now it was Agathas turn to worry. </p><p>“Alright, come on.” She took the other womans arm, tried not to focus too much on how toned it was, how well she could feel all the muscle in it, and slowly guided her to a bench nearby. </p><p>“Sit,” she ordered.</p><p>“You're bossy,” Rio grinned. </p><p>“Shut up.” “Hey, I wasn't complaining.” </p><p>Agatha didn't dignify that with a response, instead she sat down next to the other woman and lightly tugged at the hem of her sport shirt. By the looks of it, Rio had been on a run as well. </p><p>“Can I…I just wanna check if you're…” Suddenly, the all too familiar feeling of being way too flustered returned, and Agatha could already feel the redness creeping on her face. Rio just smiled at her, either not seeing her blush (highly unlikely, but Agatha could hope), or choosing to ignore it. She placed her hands over Agathas and slowly pulled up the side of her shirt until right over the lower end of a forest green sports bra. </p><p>Agathas breath hitched. Rios hands over hers, Rios skin exposed to her, her bra visible to Agatha- it was all too much. </p><p>Agatha gulped and forced herself to focus. She could detangle whatever weird stuff was going on with her later (or never, preferably), right now she needed to make sure Rio was okay. </p><p>Right over her ribs, her skin had started to turn red, even though no actual bruising was visible. Well, yet. Agatha felt her chest tighten at the idea that Rios skin might bruise, and it would be because of her.</p><p>“Can I touch you?” Her voice was quiet, she didn't trust it to stay steady if she spoke at normal volume. The other woman just nodded. Agatha took her hand from under Rios and let her fingers graze lightly over the reddened skin. Immediately, she could see goosebumps form. </p><p>“Does this hurt?” Her voice was barely above a whisper now. She could see Rio swallow, and wondered briefly why the other woman could possibly be affected by this. </p><p>“No, it doesn't hurt.” </p><p>Apparently Agatha wasn't the only one whispering. </p><p>She pressed her fingers slightly harder, and Rio flinched. Immediately, Agatha retreated her hand. </p><p>“I'm sorry,” she murmured. </p><p>“It's okay.” Rios voice was soft.”But yeah, that did kinda hurt. Don't worry about it, it'll probably bruise a bit, but that's fine, it'll be gone in a few days.”</p><p>Slowly, she lowered her shirt back down and turned so she could face Agatha directly. </p><p>“Thanks for checking on me. That was sweet.” </p><p>Agatha bit her lips and Rio frowned. Instinctively, she reached out and grabbed Agathas hand. Everything in Agatha screamed to free herself from the contact. She didn't. She intertwined her fingers with Rios and let them rest in her lap. </p><p>“Are you hurt?” Now it was Rios turn to sound worried. </p><p>Quickly, she shook her head. </p><p>“I'm good.”</p><p>Rio smiled at her. Something was glazing her lips, and Agatha briefly wondered if she was the type of person who chose flavored chapstick. The idea on how to find out that flashed through her brain made her actually flinch. Immediately, Rios grip on her hand tightened. </p><p>“Hey, what's wrong? Are you sure you're not hurt?” </p><p>Agatha just nodded. She needed to get out of here. Clearly, being around Rio was messing with her mind. Maybe she wasn't over Jens comment from yesterday, maybe it was still too present in her brain. Yes, that's what this was, that comment. Just the comment. </p><p>She took a shaky breath and pulled her hand out of Rios grip. Immediately, she missed the contact. <em> God, was she actually going crazy? </em></p><p>“Agatha…” Rio started, but Agatha jumped up, every fiber in her being needing to get away from this woman, this kind, gorgeous, confusing woman, yet everything in her also craved to feel her touch for just one more second. </p><p>“I'm sorry, I…I gotta go. It was nice seeing you, or, like… I mean… I'm sorry about… you know…Hope you feel better! Put some ice on it. K, bye!” Agatha stumbled away.</p><p>
<em> 'K bye?' Had she actually gone fucking insane? </em>
</p><p>She sprinted all the way back to her house, reveling in the burn of her lungs, as it gave her something to focus on besides the feelings she refused to name. </p><p>It wasn't until she collapsed onto her couch, not caring about the fact that she was still in her sweaty workout clothes, that she realized her phone was not with her.</p>

<span>For a total of one hour and almost forty minutes, Agatha managed to convince herself that she didn't need her phone. She showered, changed into sweat shorts, a tank top, and her favorite robe, the black one with the intricate purple and green embroidery , made herself an early dinner, cleaned the kitchen, paced up and down her hallway about seventeen times, and opened the website of the nearest apple store on her laptop to check out prices. After about two minutes, she shut her laptop with an exasperated sigh (and possibly a bit too much force) and leaned back on her couch. This was ridiculous. She had gotten her phone less than three months ago, it was the newest iphone, and in absolute top condition (well, that last part might not be entirely true anymore after the fall it had taken earlier today). There was absolutely no need to lay down a shit ton of money just to avoid seeing one specific person. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wasn't worried that her phone was still laying on the ground in the park, she knew Rio had been sitting on the bench when she had hurried away, and unless Rio was completely blind, she would have noticed the neon purple case in the mud. </span>
</p><p>
<span>What was she gonna do? Why the fuck did the universe keep pushing her and Rio together? As it turned out, the universe didn't just shamelessly put Agatha in situations where she had to be confronted with Rio, it also seemed to have a wicked sense of humor. In the middle of Agathas little thought spiral, her laptop dinged, signaling that she had gotten an email. </span>

</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey Agatha,</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I'm guessing you've noticed by now that you've left something behind after our little run-in (hahah) earlier ;) I got your phone, it has a few scratches, but I'm positive it's just the screen protector, so don't worry. I cleaned the mud off, too. Sorry you left in such a hurry, it took me a few seconds until I noticed the purple blop on the ground and by the time I had connected the dots, you were already gone. Anyways, I have texted Alice who has texted Jen for your email, and now I'm hoping to reach you this way. Just lmk when and how you wanna meet up, so we can return your phone to its rightful owner. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hope you're good (and really didn't take away any injuries from earlier)!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>xxx, Rio</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>P.S. Neon? Wouldn't have expected that from you, but it's kinda adorable, I gotta say. The purple is fitting though, you have the vibe of someone whose favorite color is purple.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>P.P.S. If our first meeting would've been an actual date, I would now make a joke about the fact that I have gotten your email before I ever got your phone number. But alas…the P.P.S. of this email? What? Who said that? Not me, that's for sure ;) </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha buried her face in her hands. This woman was going to be the death of her. God, Agatha needed to get a grip. Okay. Time to focus. She could do this.</span>

</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hi Rio,</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>First of all, thanks for picking up my phone. I'm busy tomorrow and Tuesday, but I could swing by Wednesday to pick it up? Around late afternoon? There's no need for you to go anywhere, it's my phone after all. Let me know if that works for you, if not, I'm open to a different suggestion, I'd just need to check my calendar. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I hope you're feeling better and the bruising isn't too bad.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Kind regards, </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>P.S. What's wrong with neon? And what is “you have the vibe of someone whose favorite color is purple” even supposed to mean?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>P.P.S. I'm just gonna ignore that you just said that.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>P.P.P.S. Where does “green witch” come from? Did you make your email in highschool and just never bothered to change it?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before she could overthink it, Agatha hit send. There. Done. Distanced, clear, to the point. Maybe the last part was a bit unnecessary, a bit too personal, but Agatha couldn't help it. She was intrigued, and she wanted to know the story behind Rios email handle. Sue her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The idea of waiting three more days until she would have her phone back didn't excite her, but she had office hours until the evening tomorrow, and a night class on tuesday. Oh well. Wednesday it was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Another sound from the computer in her lap informed her that she had already received another email. Damn, did Rio have no hobbies? Agatha ignored the fact that she was also literally sitting here about to open the email that was a response to her own email that she had sent only a couple minutes ago. It wasn't like she herself was any better.</span>

<span>I'm gonna drop off something at a friends place at eight, meaning I'll be out with my car anyways. If you shoot me your address, I can come by afterwards and drop off your phone. Only if that works for you though. Otherwise, Wednesday is fine. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>xxx, Rio</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>P.S. Hey, it wasn't an insult. But I'm not gonna tell you what exactly I meant with that, just forget I said anything. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>P.P.S. Isn't telling me you're ignoring it basically the opposite of actually ignoring it?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>P.P.P.S. I'm offended! Highschool? Please. I'm an actual witch, Agatha. I guess this is how you're finding out about it ;)</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio and her damn smiley faces and her little “xxx”. Agatha sucked in a breath. Tonight. That would mean seeing Rio twice in one day. Was she emotionally stable enough for that? Something about that woman clearly unsettled her, and even though she didn't know what it was </span>
<em>
<span>(not what Jen had suggested! Not that! 100% not that! Jen was not right!)</span>
</em>
<span>, she couldn't deny that it was there anymore.</span>

<span>Sorry, not to double-text (or double-mail? Is that a thing?), but my friend just messaged me that she needs me to help her set it up (dropping off used printer for her home office), shouldn't take longer than ten minutes, depending on your location I could be there between 8:30 and 9:00, lmk if that works, no worries if not, your phone is safe with me either way. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>xxx, Rio </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha read the email twice. She closed her laptop and got up, walked to her kitchen and back into her living room, then to the kitchen again. She got a bottle of water from her fridge and put it back in without even having opened it. Okay, she had to get her shit together. She was a thirty-nine year old woman, why was she behaving like this over someone who technically had no significance to her? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Back on her couch, Agatha opened up her laptop again. She had made a decision. Exposure therapy it was. Whatever dumb shit her mind had been conjuring up in regards to Rio Vidal, it had to end eventually. She was just gonna confront it head on. She was gonna tell Rio to come tonight, have a civil and normal interaction with her, receive her phone, and that would be it. Yup. Confrontation. Good. Mature. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Why was her heart beating so fast when she hit send on the email telling Rio her address?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>About an hour later, the doorbell rang. Agatha shot up from her spot on the couch so fast, she almost got dizzy for a second. Alright, this was a great start. After regaining her composure, she made her way to her front door. She got this. Everything was okay. This was normal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a deep breath and opened the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, long time no see.” Rio beamed at her as if Agatha was actually someone close to her that she hadn't seen in ages. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cleared her throat, unsure of what to say. Was she supposed to invite Rio in? Offer her something? Or was this gonna be a doorknob transaction? </span>
</p><p>
<span>A few seconds passed. Agathas gaze moved up and down Rios body, she couldn't help it. Rio had changed out of her running outfit, obviously, and was wearing tight black jeans, a dark green hoodie, and black doc martens. Her hair was falling over her shoulders in slight waves. She was the textbook definition of effortlessly beautiful, and Agatha felt her breath catch in her throat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was so caught up in taking the woman across from her in that it took her a moment to realize that she was doing the same. Rios gaze was filled with a hunger that would intimidate Agatha, if it wasn't for the tenderness at its edges. Suddenly, Agatha became too aware of the fact that to Rio, the only visible clothing on Agathas body was the robe. She swallowed hard as Rio tongued her cheek, her eyes raking up and down Agathas bare legs, before she seemed to catch herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After blinking a few times, she reached in the purse hanging over her shoulder and retrieved a phone in a neon purple case. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she looked at Agatha, there was a faint blush on her cheeks. But that surely could come from anything, right? Maybe it was the lighting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here. Like I said, a few scratches, but honestly, if you change the screen protector, you should be just fine. There was quite a bit of mud on it, but I made sure to get it all off. No idea if it still works properly, but fingers crossed, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a small smile, she handed over the phone. Their fingers touched, and a bolt of electricity shot through Agathas entire body. It wasn't uncomfortable though. It made her feel alive. For a moment, neither woman made a move to take her hand back, and so they just stood there, the neon purple phone in between them, the lingering touch of their fingers setting not just Agathas body, but her entire soul on fire. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, Rio took her hand back, and for some reason, Agathas first instinct was to reach out, grab it, and intertwine their fingers. Instead, she put her phone in the pocket of her shorts and looked at Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you. You really didn't have to come all the way here tonight, but I do appreciate it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, I was out anyways. It was no hassle, really, don't worry about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a grateful smile. She felt like she should do something, offer something in return for Rios efforts. Not only had she actually picked up her phone, she had taken it home, cleaned it, and brought it right to Agathas doorstep the very same day. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I… I mean… I wanna repay you somehow.” </span>
<em>
<span>God, why was she so fucking awkward? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. Her hair was flowing around her head looking like a brown velvet halo. It was mesmerizing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously, it's all good. There's no need.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wracked her brain for something she could offer, something, anything. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even if there's no need, I want to. Truly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled at her again. God, her smile had to possess the ability to light up this entire city, there was no other way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I would say you could buy me a coffee, but it's almost nine in the evening, so…” Her voice trailed off, but suddenly, Agatha felt desperate. For a second, she didn't even care about the confusing feelings bubbling dangerously close under the surface, she could deal with that later (</span>
<em>
<span>or never</span>
</em>
<span>), right now, the most important job that Agatha had ever been faced with was somehow convincing this woman in front of her to let her take her out for coffee. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Another day then.” Her voice sounded way too desperate for her liking, but there was nothing she could do about it now. She had to focus on the task ahead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let's do it some other day. I'm off all day on Wednesday, or I have a free period in the afternoon on thursday. Then there's always the weekend, and…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rios laugh interrupted her. There was no malice to it, no condescendence. If Agatha wouldn't have known any better, she could have sworn she could hear a hint of adoration in there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're really persistent, Miss Harkness.” She had said it in a teasing tone, but something about having Rio call her that did something to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only in important matters,” she responded, and Rio laughed again. Agatha wanted to take her laugh and bottle it, keeping it close to her at all times, at her disposal whenever she needed her world filled with just a little more light. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, my favorite coffee spot is about half an hour from here. Wednesday works for me, how about we meet there in the afternoon? Say… around four?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha decided that she would be there at exactly four pm and not a single second later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, sounds good.” She tried really hard to keep her voice casual. It did not go well, but she gave herself an A for effort. “Just send me the name, and I'll meet you there.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>An amused sparkle appeared in Rios dark brown eyes. “And you want me to do that in an email, or…?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>An awkward chuckle escaped Agatha. She wanted the floor to open up and swallow her, but she also really wanted to have this gorgeous womans number in her phone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here.” She unlocked her phone, opened up the contacts app, and handed it back to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She typed in her number and gave it back to Agatha with a smile and told her “just shoot me a text and then I'll have your number too.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A few seconds passed. Agatha held tightly onto her phone, as if it suddenly had become her most prized possession, solely because of the fact that it now entailed Rio Vidals phone number. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I guess I'll see you on wednesday after all,” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It took everything in Agatha to not break out in an overly eager nod.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, sure. I'll see you then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The other moved to leave.. Before she began her descent down the stairs, she turned around one last time, giving Agatha a genuine smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Te veo.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agathas heart right about exploded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The following two days were a complete haze. Agatha got through her lectures and office hours, graded papers, and prepared classes, but she felt like she was never able to fully focus on any task. Wednesday was always in the back of her mind. </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span> was always in the back of her mind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had texted Rio that same evening she had come by to bring her her phone. What ended up one short (and, so Agatha desperately hoped, casual) message (“</span>
<em>
<span>Hey, it's Agatha, thanks again, I'm looking forward to wednesday</span>
</em>
<span>”), took almost an hour to formulate, as Agatha was driving herself to the edge of insanity trying to figure out the perfect text.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rios answer had come just a few minutes later. She had sent a link to the cafe (it was called 'The Witches Road', Agatha had never heard of it) and told her that she was looking forward to seeing her again. Agatha had buried her head in her pillow at that, trying to muffle whatever high-pitched sounds were for some reason leaving her mouth. Ridiculous. She was fucking ridiculous. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now it was Wednesday morning, almost 5:30 am. No, there was absolutely no logical reason why Agatha would be up at this hour. She was off work today, aside from looking over a few essays some students had asked her feedback on, her to-do list was completely empty, and she wasn't meeting Rio until the afternoon. Yet here she was, tossing and turning and unable to relax enough to catch a couple more hours of sleep. Around six am, she finally gave up and decided to start her day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The entire morning was spent fighting the urge to text Rio something along the lines of “I can't wait to see you later.” By 12 pm, Agatha seriously began to question if she had lost it. Maybe she was getting sick. Yeah, that could be it, maybe- As soon as Agatha was hit by the realization that being sick could be a potential threat to seeing Rio, she reluctantly gave up on that excuse. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By 3 pm, Agatha was showered, dressed, and ready. Her bedroom was an unspeakable mess, with basically the entirety of the contents of her closet spread out on her floor and bed, but Agatha herself looked composed and put together. And it only took her two and a half hours to get there. Well. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After trying on at least thirty different outfit combinations, she had settled on wide grey linen pants, a white turtleneck, and a brown blazer. Not too casual, but hopefully not too over the top. She had opted for leaving her hair down. The finishing touch was her locket, obviously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to be calm, she really did. But by the time it hit 3:10 pm, she just gave up, called an uber, and was on her way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Agatha arrived at the cafe, it was a little over ten minutes before she was supposed to meet Rio. Unsure of what to do, she started to pace up and down in front of the building, but when she realized that all that was doing was making her insanity visible to other people, she took a deep breath and entered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Upon taking the first step in, she could immediately understand why Rio liked it here. The cafe was a pretty big open space, yet it somehow managed to convey a cozy atmosphere. There were tables scattered around, with big velvet chairs around them. Fake trees, which looked actually real, were put in random spots throughout the room, with fairy lights wrapped around them. Calm music was playing over some invisible speaker, and it smelled like fresh coffee and, somehow, incense. Agatha immediately loved it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just when she tried to decide whether to wait by the counter or look for a table for her and Rio, she felt a soft touch on the small of her back. Startled, she turned around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, sorry, I didn't mean to spook you.” Rio gave her an apologetic smile and immediately removed her hand. Agatha decided that asking her to put it back would be a crazy thing to do, so she settled for a smile herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're early.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, well, so are you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, point taken. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where would you like to sit?” Rio gestured around the room. “I usually take a table in the back, it's quieter and cozier, but honestly I don't mind anywhere, your pick.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a small thing, but Rio being considerate enough to ask Agatha her preferences and letting her choose made her heart melt a little. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“In the back sounds good,” she managed to say, and let Rio guide her to a table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they sat down, Agatha immediately sunk into the soft cushions. A surprised laugh escaped her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, okay, this is seriously the most comfortable chair I have ever sat in.” She looked at Rio, giving her voice a conspiratorial edge. “Is there a backdoor to this place? I'd like to steal one.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio put her hand over her mouth to stifle her laugh and kicked lightly against Agathas shin. “You're insane, did you know that?” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, you have no idea.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They ordered their drinks, a cappuccino for Agatha and a matcha for Rio (which earned her a teasing remark from Agatha “oh, you're one of those people who like to drink grass”) and settled into easy conversation. Agatha was surprised how comfortable she felt talking to Rio, and briefly wondered how this comfort was even possible with all the nervous energy swirling around inside of her, before she decided not to question it and just to enjoy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, Agatha.” Rio set her mug down and gave her an expectant look. “I know this is kind of a basic question, but I don't even know what you do. What's your job?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha put her own drink down and leaned back. God, this chair really was a whole new level of soft. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm a professor,” she answered. “I teach English literature and creative writing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heartbeat sped up a little at Rios genuinely interested look. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That sounds really cool, Agatha. How did you get there?” Agatha could tell that she really wanted to know, that she actually cared, and it made her want to open up and not only tell the other woman about how she came into her line of work, but every single secret buried somewhere inside of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“When I was younger, I wanted to be an author. That was my plan for quite a long time, and it is why I decided to study creative writing, with a minor in English lit. I loved my classes in college a lot, it brought me such joy to be able to learn what I got to learn, to study all these amazing topics, and I really do enjoy academia. That, plus the idea of a secure job and financial stability versus the stress of meeting deadlines and having to combat writers block under pressure, made me eventually settle on teaching. And I haven't regretted it a day in my life. I love it, it was definitely the right path for me, and I feel immense gratitude for that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled fondly, thinking of her job. For some of her colleagues, work was just work, a necessary, but not very enjoyable thing, but Agatha thrived in what she did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It seems like you really love it,” Rio smiled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip and looked down, suddenly embarrassed she let herself get carried away, but Rio seemed to catch her discomfort. She placed a soft hand on Agathas knee. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, look at me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was hesitant at first, but she tilted her head to meet Rios eyes. There was no judgement in there, just genuine interest, and, damn, that thing that looked too much like adoration again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It's amazing you love what you do so much, and it's mesmerizing hearing you talk about it,” Rio said, nothing but honesty in her voice. Agatha gave her a thankful smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After squeezing Agathas knee, Rio took her hand back and picked up her mug again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” she grinned, “you said you wanted to be an author. Do you still write?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel her cheeks flush. For a split second, she considered lying, but what was the point? Besides, Rio had this… energy about her that made Agatha want to tell her nothing but the truth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do, yeah.” Her voice was shy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She prepared for Rio asking her about it, asking what exactly she wrote, begging her to read something, the reactions she normally got from people, and while they were understandable, Agatha didn't particularly enjoy them. Despite author being her career dream when she was younger, Agatha didn't really like talking her writing up to other people, and she felt insecure about showing them samples. To her, it felt like giving away pieces of her soul to eyes they weren't meant for. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio just leaned back in her chair, took another sip of her matcha and smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That's good. It's a beautiful thing that you were able to maintain what you originally wanted to do while pursuing a career that clearly makes you happy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>If that would have been possible for Agatha, she might have fallen in love with Rio Vidal right then and there. But no, she reminded herself, straight. Straight straight straight. This was a ridiculous thought to even entertain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Quickly, she changed the topic. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, we've talked about me- what do you do?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat her mug back down and leaned forward slightly, as if she wanted to give Agatha her full attention while sharing these things about herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I work in counseling, actually,” she said. Agatha nodded, while the other woman continued. “I specialize in treating people who have experienced loss and are dealing with grief.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha inhaled sharply. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It sounds like you're doing amazing work.” Her voice was quiet as she spoke. “Though I can imagine it gets hard sometimes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a sad smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“All the time, actually. But like you, I feel like this is the right path for me. I always knew I wanted to help people, and this job feels… meaningful, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. A few seconds passed, before Rio spoke again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The people I see… they've had tragedy strike them. Someone they love dearly has left this earth. And while their souls have been guided to the afterlife, the people left behind are still here, forced to deal with it. If I can make carrying that just a little lighter, I know I am doing something right.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt an intense pull towards the woman sitting across from her. Without a second thought, she reached out and took her hand. Rio seemingly relaxed at the contact, and it wasn't long until her thumb was stroking slow circles on Agathas skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat in silence for a while, though it wasn't uncomfortable. There was no pressure to talk, but suddenly, a thought appeared in Agathas mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait,” she declared, “you said 'someone they love'... but the person passed away. Why 'love', why didn't you say 'loved'?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The circles stopped, but Rio still held onto Agathas hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don't believe love ends just because someone died. Real love doesn't just fade when ones life does,” she said simply, and to Agatha, this made all the sense in the world.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio insisted on paying, even though Agatha tried to fight her on it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This whole thing was supposed to be a thank-you for bringing me my phone back,” she pouted, but Rio was not letting up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Consider your company the thank-you,” she quipped and swiftly put her credit card in the machine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha rolled her eyes, she slightly nudged her and laughed “if you're that salty about it, you may take me out again, and I promise I'll behave and let you pay, my lady.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha didn't react, she turned serious and put her hand on her arm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, don't worry, I'm just joking around. We don't have to meet up again, I mean it, your company was more than enough of a thank-you. Besides, I told you before, nothing would've even been necessary anyways, of course I gave you your phone back.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>What Agatha didn't say was that she hadn't frozen up because she was uncomfortable at the idea of seeing Rio again. It was just that realizing just how badly she wanted that to happen had momentarily overwhelmed her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That night, she called her best friend again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the phone got picked up, Agatha suddenly felt tears run down her face, she couldn't help it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen,” she whispered, “I think you're right.”</span>

<p>
<span>When Agatha woke up the next morning, she was granted a whole second of bliss. A whole second, before her mind caught up to the events of last night, a whole second where she just got to…exist, wrapped up in her cozy blanket and the delightful ignorance of someone whose hazy state right after waking up didn't force her to remember just yet, with the sunlight hitting her face on just the right angle that it wasn't blinding her, but instead warmed her skin and made her feel like maybe, just maybe, today was going to be a good day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, that second was over, and when bits and pieces of what happened not too many hours ago eventually formed a cohesive picture in her mind, Agatha shot up in her bed and buried her face in her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god oh my god oh my god.” Her own voice sounded foreign to her. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>What the fuck happened?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn't unfamiliar with this particular feeling - waking up in the morning, drowning in regret and feeling slightly nauseous, wishing she could undo what had ensued the prior night, but usually, this feeling occurred after way more had happened than a phone call and some texts, usually it involved a naked man in bed next to her and a lot of alcohol still in her bloodstream. And while Agatha was grateful that she didn't have to deal with either of </span>
<em>
<span>those </span>
</em>
<span>right now, what she actually saw herself confronted with, wasn't necessarily… easier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a while, she was just sitting there, head in her hands, nothing more than an almost forty year old woman questioning everything about herself she had spent her entire life convincing herself was true. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Turning on her phone proved to be its very own challenge, as she feared what notifications might greet her, but she needed to know the time, needed to know how much of it she had left before she inevitably would be forced to actually leave her bed and get ready for the day. Going through a whole identity crisis sadly didn't excuse her from showing up to work. At least she only had one lecture around noon today, and then another one in the later afternoon, before she would be able to head home for the day and bury herself back in her bed and her confusing, overwhelming feelings. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>08:14.</span>
</em>
<span> Well, that wasn't bad. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen &lt;3: If you wanna talk more, I'm here.</span>
</em>
<span> Also not bad. Sweet, actually. But she wasn't ready to speak with her friend again just yet.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: I'm sorry you felt like you couldn't tell me what exactly had you so agitated. I'm here if you wanna speak more.</span>
</em>
<span> Also sweet. But definitely bad. Now she had written proof that last night was, in fact, not just a very realistic nightmare. Also, '</span>
<em>
<span>agitated</span>
</em>
<span>' was a really kind description for the way Agatha had behaved. But that was Rio. Kind. And it made all of this all the more difficult. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sigh, Agatha put her phone back on her nightstand and let herself fall back onto her cushions. She didn't want to deal with any of this, she didn't feel ready. </span>
<em>
<span>Would she feel ready if she let some more time pass? </span>
</em>
<span>Probably not. </span>
<em>
<span>Definitely not.</span>
</em>
<span> But it was just too tempting and Agatha was too stubborn and too overwhelmed. So, with one last deep breath, she sat back up, swung her legs over the edge of her bed, and got up to start her day. She would tackle this mess later. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As it turned out, simply </span>
<em>
<span>deciding</span>
</em>
<span> to deal with something at another time didn’t ensure that it would leave your mind until then. Agatha spent the entire morning wrapped up in recurring images from what had happened last night, no matter how hard she tried to combat them. When she arrived in the lecture hall a few minutes early to set up for the class, her mind had been running on overdrive for hours already, and she was exhausted, despite her workday not even having started yet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The room slowly began to fill up with students and Agatha took a deep breath. Time to pull herself together. She had a job to do. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The portion of the semester where the curriculum suggested diving into the work of Emily Dickinson was always very well received within the student body. They were nearing the end of October, meaning there was only one full month left before finals would be rapidly approaching, making Dickinsons work the last major topic of the course. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As expected, when Agatha showed the first slide of the presentation she had prepared, excited murmurs emersed among the students, an excited anticipation filling the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As always, Agatha began her lectures by sharing an outline for the subtopics they would explore, as well as giving an overview of the main assignment, which would be an essay about a subject the students were free to choose, as long as it had a justified association with the a major topic regarding Dickinson that they would tend to in class. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha finished her explanations, she announced a fifteen minute window for the students to look over the lesson plan and brainstorm ideas for what they wanted their essays to be about..</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to make it clear that you do not have to be settled on an exact topic by the end of these fifteen minutes. The goal of this is just to familiarize yourself with the lesson plan, as well as find out a direction you would like to go into. I do, however, expect a short expose by the end of next week. I think that is a fair amount of time to settle on a topic and outline your process.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Approving murmur was the answer, and Agatha sat down behind her desk, satisfied. She expected the students to be motivated, she had taught enough classes to know that the work of Dickinson was always a welcome topic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fifteen minutes later, she rose from her chair and clapped her hands, demanding the class to focus their attention back to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are there any questions about the assignment?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The hand of a young man in the front row shot up. Agatha knew him, he was always very eager, sometimes a bit too much, but he meant well, and had genuine passion for his major, which she respected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How long is the expose supposed to be? And the essay? And how realistic would it be to cover multiple of the topics in my essay? I feel inclined to dive into one specific piece of work that we will analyze in this course, but I also want to-” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held up a hand to stop his word flow, but she gave him a slight smile to ensure he knew she didn't mean to interrupt him in a rude manner..</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I appreciate your enthusiasm, Mr. Kaplan.” With the amount of talking William Kaplan was doing in her classes, as well as the amount of times he had shown up to her office hours, solely to discuss his ongoing writing projects or a topic from her lectures he was particularly interested in, she had easily memorized his name by now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Technically, you are free to cover multiple aspects in your essay. However, I highly suggest you stick to one, as it allows for a more in-depth process. Your text should be between seven and ten pages, double spaced. For the expose, I really want to emphasize that it should be short. I'm not giving you a guideline for that, feel free to submit your ideas for your essays in the shortest way possible, yet without withholding crucial information. Does that answer your questions, Mr. Kaplan?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The student nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, Professor Harkness, thank you Professor Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She answered a couple more questions, before a hand rose from the very last row of the lecture hall. Agatha thought for a second, but she couldn't remember the girls name for the life of her. She did recognize her, but she was usually a quiet student, keeping to herself and rarely contributing to class discussions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes?” She looked directly at the girl in hopes that she would realize that Agatha was calling on her, without actually having to use her name. She did. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it possible to write the essay about a topic that isn't mapped extensively in the lesson plan?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. She knew that five lectures, one a week for the following five weeks, which was the outlined timeframe the curriculum gave for teaching her students about Dickinson, was obviously not enough to cover every last part of the poets work and life, yet she had felt confident she was covering the important highlights pretty lengthily when creating her lesson plan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you have a topic in mind?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The young woman nodded. “I do, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would like to explore the question of Emily Dickinsons sexuality, her relationship with Susan Gilbert, as well as some of her writing about her.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agathas breath hitched. For a moment, she was caught completely off guard. Of course there was a section in the lesson plan about Susan Gilbert, yet Agatha had kept it rather small, in comparison to other topics. She had told herself that it was because she wanted her class to focus more on the poets work than her personal life, and it had absolutely nothing to do with finding herself spiraling when her recent research for creating the lesson plan had led her to a multitude of articles of people theorizing about the womans sexual orientation and dissecting her words in search of proof that she liked women.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, Miss…” she paused, but the student caught on immediately. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Calderu, Carina Calderu,” she offered. Right, the principals granddaughter. Agatha nodded and continued,</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miss Calderu. Your interest beyond the lesson plan is admirable, yet I am not entirely sure I can allow that. The assignment does state specifically that you're free in the choice of your topic, as long as it is associated with one of the major topics from the lesson plan.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Carina did not seem satisfied with that answer and pressed on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even if it's not a major topic in the lesson plan, it was a major topic in her life. Doesn't that deserve to be acknowledged?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Approving hums and murmurs from some of the students filled the room. Agatha sighed. The girl was making a valid point, she had to give her that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Carina didn't seem to be finished talking yet. With a steady voice, she went on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think that our sexuality can be an integral part of who we are, and it is ours, and ours alone. We can hold it close to our heart or we can wear it on our sleeve, we can live it loudly, for the world to hear and see, or quietly, just for us, and the people who matter. What's important is that in a lot of places in todays America, we have the right to make that choice. Emily did not. I want to shine light on that, I want to create space for that part of her, that part that hundreds of years later, people still speculate about, without ever being able to get confirmation. And I want to do it in the most respectful way. I wish to give a stage to Emilys relationship with Susan, her relationship with herself and her sexuality, without assuming I will ever know. Emilys work is a gift to this world, and some of the things she wrote to and about Susan belong in museums, if you ask me. I want to appreciate it, without daring to presume I can deliver facts about Emilys sexuality or about what Susan truly was to her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something about her little speech touched Agatha. She wasn't sure if it was the sheer passion radiating from the young woman, or her consistent use of Dickinsons first name, almost making it seem like she had a personal connection with the poet, like she was talking, caring, about a dear friend instead of a long gone writer she was studying at university. But either way, Agatha couldn't argue that the student was making compelling points, and she was impressed by how firm she was willing to argue for what was clearly of great importance to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will allow it,” Agatha heard herself say, before she could change her mind. “Make sure you outline all the important points in your expose. I look forward to reading your essay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Carina beamed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you Professor Harkness.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now if there aren't any further questions, let's move forward with the lecture.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha managed to ignore both Jens and Rios text from this morning, as well as the fourteen other messages Jen had sent her over the course of the day (she was relentless and had zero shame in blowing up Agathas phone). But when she hit her free period in the afternoon and retreated to the quiet of her office, she couldn't escape anymore. At some point, she had to talk to her best friend again (even though she (to her defense, very shortly), contemplated cutting Jennifer off and moving on with her life. How badly did she need a best friend, </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span>?).</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sigh, she unlocked her phone and went to imessage, where she was promptly greeted by Jennifer Kales flood of texts.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen &lt;3: If you wanna talk more, I'm here.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen &lt;3: Just text me or call me, I'll be in the store all day but I'm keeping my phone close.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen &lt;3: I'm here for you and I love you, you know that, right?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen &lt;3: You can come to me when you're ready, no pressure, okay.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen &lt;3: Okay, maybe a little pressure. It's almost noon, Agatha, at least let me know you're not having another breakdown or something.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The messages continued to become increasingly more demanding, with the last one, sent at 02:11pm, so only about ten minutes ago, just reading</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen &lt;3: I swear if i don't have proof of life by 3 pm I'm coming down to your fucking job and locking you in my car until you can believably tell me that you are fucking okay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>'</span>
<em>
<span>Back with the exclamation marks</span>
</em>
<span>' Agatha thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could waste her time formulating messages she would just end up deleting anyways because somehow she struggled to put her thoughts about all this into words, she clicked on the call icon and facetimed her friend. Jen picked up almost immediately, which made Agatha grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you not at work?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen rolled her eyes, even though she was clearly relieved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told you I was keeping my fucking phone with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They bickered back and forth for a little while, before Jen cut to the chase. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen, Agatha. I care about you, you know I care about you. I'm not pressuring you into anything, but I do think there's some things you need to be honest about, if not to me, then at least to yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. She had put her phone up against the opened laptop on her desk, which left her hands free to, once again, bury her head in them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think there's any chance we could just forget last night?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She peeked through her fingers at her friends face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you, in all honesty, think that just brushing over the fact that you called me crying last night, telling me that you think I was right to suggest you having a crush on a woman, then continued to spiral into a full blown breakdown, sobbing about how you feel like you don't even know yourself and you're so scared, me having to talk you down so you wouldn't freaking hyperventilate, and then you abruptly hanging up to do god knows what, would serve you long time?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grumbled. She wanted to be stubborn, wanted to spit out “yes”, but she didn't. Jen was right. She knew Jen was right. But that didn't mean she had to like it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I called Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jens eyes went wide?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said I hung up to do god knows what. I hung up and called Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha Harkness! When I said 'god knows what', I meant that I assumed you got drunk or cried hugging your teddy bear, or, I don't know, cried and fucking watched 'but I'm a cheerleader', not call the woman who this mess of feelings you're experiencing is about!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don't have a teddy bear,” Agatha shot back, “and why the fuck would I watch a movie about a cheerleader?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen broke out into exasperated laughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, you really are a baby lesbian.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words were meant in a light manner, but they went straight through Agathas chest, puncturing her heart in a way that pained her, and her lungs in a way that made it hard for her to breathe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don't say that,” Agathas voice was weak, and she hated it. Her eyes were filling up with tears, threatening to spill over. She knew that Jen hadn't meant to hurt her, and she wasn't </span>
<em>
<span>insulted </span>
</em>
<span>by being called a lesbian. </span>
<em>
<span>Obviously</span>
</em>
<span>. But having it out there, just like that, plain and simple - it scared her senseless. She felt like Jen had taken the hem of her security blanket and ripped it away from her, without warning, and without Agatha having even the slightest chance of ever getting it back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, I'm sorry.” Jens voice was tinged with regret, and she seemed genuinely apologetic. “We don't have to discuss labels right now, okay. Tell me what happened on the call with Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could tell that her friend was trying to change the topic, to steer away from what was clearly too touchy a subject right now, but her topic of choice didn't necessarily make Agatha more comfortable. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, she answered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you remember the state I was in when I hung up on you. Yep, that was the exact state I called her in. And even better yet, I facetimed her, so she got to see me in all my crying glory, red eyes, tear-stained cheeks, all that shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen just looked at her softly, encouraging her to keep going.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She got super worried, and the first thing she asked was 'what can I do to help?'. Can you imagine that, Jen? We're on the phone for like two seconds, and the first thing this woman does is asking how she can help.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha almost cried at the memory. When Rio had first said it, she hadn't just almost cried, the gesture had left her in actual tears..</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She tried to calm me down, asking what was wrong and what I needed, but I was sobbing my ass off so hard that I couldn't speak. When she said that she was gonna come over because the state I was in worried her and she wanted to make sure I was alright, I somehow got my voice back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip. She wasn't necessarily proud of the next part. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I basically yelled at her not to come over and that seeing her would just make everything worse and since she had entered my life, I have been a mess, and it's all her fault, and shit like that. I kept going like that for a while, just crying in front of her and accusing her of fucking with my head. When I finally shut up, she just looked at me with her damn kind eyes and asked me what exactly she had done, and how she could make it better. Fuck, Jen, I had just spent minutes shouting at her, and she sits there and asks how she can make it better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did you say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a bitter laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn't say anything. I hung up. I fucking hung up on her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen gave her a kind smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, well, you seem to have a habit of doing that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rios unanswered message popped up in Agathas mind, and she told her friend about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen raised her eyebrows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I'm gonna say something, and I don't want you to freak out, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha thought that never in history had anyone ever heard that sentence and </span>
<em>
<span>didn't </span>
</em>
<span>freak out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There are a lot of women who could have been your sexual awakening. You are really fucking lucky that it's a woman like Rio Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agathas heartbeat sped up, and the room started spinning. But somehow, somewhere in her panicky haze, she knew that Jennifer wasn't wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She needed to talk to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Damn.</span>
</em>

<p>
<span>Somehow, she wasn't sure how, Agatha managed to get through her second lecture of the day, to get in her car after work, to drive herself home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she finally, finally, closed the door behind her, for a second it felt like her legs were gonna give out. She stumbled, but caught herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything felt like too much, she wanted, needed a break, but somehow the world didn't bend to Agatha Harkness' wishes, and just kept turning. Rude. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha made her way into the kitchen, she noticed that the sky had turned dark. It was gonna rain. A lot, from the looks of it. Well, she had absolutely nowhere to be today anymore, so this didn’t really concern her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She knew she should cook dinner, but somehow, her feet led her straight to the wine cabinet. Without thinking too much about it, she grabbed the nearest bottle of red and turned on her heels. The couch was her destination, and while she was kicking off her shoes, her fingers already battled the cork. </span>
<em>
<span>God, why was this thing stuck in there like that, the bottle had been opened before? </span>
</em>
<span>When her efforts finally paid off, she realized that she forgot to take a glass, and when that simple thing almost made her break out in tears again, she realized that maybe there was a bigger problem here. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>„Agatha!“ </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Her mothers voice was cutting through the silence like a knife. She could hear her footsteps approaching, counting down until her mother would reach her room, bracing herself for her fury. Agatha didn’t know what she had done wrong this time, but if she had learned one thing in her fifteen years of life, it was that just because she didn’t know, didn’t mean Evanora Harkness didn’t have a reason. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Three, two, one.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The door to her room flew open, her mother didn’t bother knocking, but that wasn’t a surprise, she rarely ever did. Her eyes zeroed in on Agatha, sitting in her bed, trying her very best to make herself as small as possible, as if that would somehow present her mother less surface to direct her anger onto. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>„Do you care to explain what I have just heard?“ </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha didn’t know what that even was, but if she dared to ask, it’d just be another reason for her mother to become even more furious. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>So she went with the safe option.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>„I‘m sorry.“</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Her mothers eyes sparkled with anger. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>„You better be! And let me tell you one thing, wicked girl- it is not gonna happen. You will not bring shame over this family, do you hear me? You will not bring shame over the Harkness name!“ </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha was eager to nod, even though she still had absolutely no idea what had her mother in such a state. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She didn’t have to wait long to learn. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>„I ran into her mother, in the grocery store, of all places! Can you imagine, Agatha? I was standing in the fruit aisle when I had to learn that my daughter was planning on being… dirty! You’re not like that, no daughter of mine is like… that!“</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She spit the last word as if it tasted disgusting on her tongue. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>„Planning to go to homecoming with another girl? What do you think is gonna happen next, hmm? What do you think this will lead to? Girls aren’t supposed to attend these events with other girls! Agatha, there’s a lot that girls aren’t supposed to do with other girls, and I am worried that if you’re willing to go to this event with one, you will have no shame participating in other… activities!“</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agathas blood felt like it froze in her veins and her entire body suddenly went cold. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Two months ago, her class had gotten a new student. Her and Agatha had gotten along immediately and within the few weeks they had known each other, they had become extremely close. It had taken a bit until Agatha was able to attribute the way her heart fluttered when the other girl would smile and wink at her from across the classroom or when she would take Agathas hand to drag her through a crowded hallway, to anything more than just being really happy they were friends. But when Ella had brought a single red rose to school and had asked in a whisper, with blush spreading across her cheeks, if Agatha could maybe imagine going to homecoming with her, Agatha stopped seeing the point in hiding from her own feelings, and when she could face them with Ella by her side, maybe they wouldn't seem so scary anymore. It wasn't love, but it was more than just a little crush, it was a deep infatuation with one another, that only seemed to grow stronger as time went on. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha felt happy. Being with Ella gave her a sense of freedom and belonging she had never known before, and now that she had gotten a taste, every fiber in her body begged her to hold onto it. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Before anything else, they were innocent. Agatha and Ella were content with fleeting touches and whispered promises, vague in nature, but honest in delivery. They didn't speak of their feelings, not to each other and not to anyone else, they didn't label their relationship, though they both knew they didn't want anyone else. No kiss was shared during the entire time their growing feelings for each other blossomed, but Agatha had a plan. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>On homecoming night, after the last dance, she would take Ella to their secret spot on the school campus, a hollow tree by the far end of the football field, and she would tell her that she would like to kiss her, and ask, if she could. And if Ella would share that wish, Agatha would take her beautiful, soft face in her hands and give her what would be the first kiss for the both of them.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Do you hear me, wretched child?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Her mothers voice dug sharp through the haze of her thoughts. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha didn't know what to do. Her mothers anger frightened her, but the idea of not attending the homecoming dance with Ella almost frightened her more.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“We haven't even done anything,” she tried to argue, but her voice sounded small and tears started pooling in her eyes.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh, but you want to. I know it, I know your dirty fantasies, I know your broken desires! Were you born evil, Agatha? Is that it? Would I have been better off if I had killed you the moment you left my body?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agathas eyes went wide. Frantically, she shook her head, and Evanora broke out in a humorless laughter. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“If you move forward with this…arrangement, you are proving to me what I have always known. You're nothing more than a weak excuse for a human being, a waste of space on this earth like no other. If you engage in such evil actions, the evil will live inside you forever. Do you hear me, child? You! Are! Evil!” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The tears were streaming down Agathas cheeks now. In desperation, she reached out to her mother.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“No, please! I can be good, I swear, I can be good.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Her mother shook her head. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“No, you cannot.” Her voice had become quieter, she almost sounded… sad. Defeated. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>And from that moment on, some part of Agatha had kept holding onto that belief like it was an unshakable truth. No, she could not be good.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Ella had cried when Agatha had told her to ask someone else to homecoming. She had tried to hold Agathas hands, but Agatha just shook her head, and walked away. She managed to ignore Ella for the rest of the school year, only stealing glances when she was certain that the object of her affection wasn't looking in her direction. At first, Ella had tried to talk to her, had begged her to tell her what she did wrong. But Agatha wouldn't budge. After a few weeks, Ella had stopped trying. And when the new school year began, Ella didn't return to class. Agatha learned a couple days later that she had moved away due to her fathers job. She never saw her again. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Eventually, Agatha stopped thinking about Ella all the time. But what she never forgot was her mothers words, and the feeling they left in her. Liking girls, she learned then, was not something she would ever be allowed to do, if she wanted to be good. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Thunder crashing made Agatha flinch, and she almost dropped the bottle of wine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Swearing under her breath, she set the bottle on her coffee table in front of the couch before leaning back. Rain had started pouring down, glistening against the glass of her windows, and her head had started to hurt. Everything was too much and all she wanted to do was curl up in bed and not think and not feel and not… </span>
<em>
<span>be</span>
</em>
<span>. Was that really too much to ask? The bottle stood in front of her like it was mocking her, and for a fleeting second, she contemplated picking it up and slamming it against the wall. Maybe the wine stains would look pretty against the snow white, and maybe the mess they would leave would distract her from the mess in her own head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn't throw the bottle. She fished her phone out of the pocket of her jeans and opened her message app. Rios unanswered text was staring at her, daring her to react. So many thoughts were swirling around in her brain, and no matter how hard she tried, there was no calming them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knew that there were a lot of things she could tell Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen thinks I have a crush on you. And so do I.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You made me dig up something I committed to keeping buried a long time ago.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I'm straight. Stop fucking with my feelings. I'm straight I'm straight I'm so fucking straight.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Kiss me, and let's see what happens.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You can't be who I want, so why does it feel like you are?.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Without reading over it again, she sent a single message. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey, Rio? Have you ever heard of that movie about a cheerleader?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Agatha awoke, it was almost two am. For a second, she felt disoriented, before her memory came back to her. Right. She had texted Rio, and then she had finally opened that wine, and drunk from it. A lot. Which now proved to have been a lovely idea considering her earlier already creeping headache. With a groan, Agatha sat up. The room was spinning around her, but after taking a few deep breaths, she managed to stand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She needed to get herself to bed, she had back to back lectures from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon. Fuck. What was she thinking, acting like some lovesick teenager drowning her despair? She was almost forty years old, frankly, this was embarrassing. God. </span>
</p><p>
<span>WIthout sparing it a glance, she grabbed her phone and made her way to her bedroom. After changing into a pair of sweatpants and a worn tank top, she headed to her bathroom. Rests of makeup were sticking to her skin, smeared lipstick painting an eerie looking smile on her face. God, she was a fucking mess. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could absolutely not be bothered to commit to her extensive skincare routine, that she normally followed religiously right now. Soaking a cloth with warm water, she scrubbed the makeup off her face, brushed her teeth, and called it a night. She needed to sleep. Hell, she needed to escape reality for a few hours.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she grabbed her phone to set her alarm for the morning, she got startled by the notification greeting her on her lockscreen. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Why the fuck is she awake at two in the morning?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rios answer was short. Just one word. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Obviously. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>With her phone in her hand, Agatha fell into a dreamless slumber. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Agatha came home from work on Friday, she didn't waste any time. Were there over two whole hours left until Rio was coming over? Yes. Was Agathas house messy? Absolutely not. Was Agatha spiraling and in desperate need of something, anything, to occupy her mind with. Oh yes, she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After deep cleaning her bathroom (</span>
<em>
<span>as if Rio was gonna look into the cabinet under the sink or check out the showerhead to ensure it was sparkling</span>
</em>
<span>), reorganizing all her kitchen cupboards, changing her sheets she had changed two days ago (</span>
<em>
<span>as if Rio was even going to enter her fucking bedroom</span>
</em>
<span>), vacuuming her entire home and wiping down every single surface she came across, Agatha sank down on her couch. She did feel a bit calmer, but maybe she was confusing calmness with exhaustion. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>06:43.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was going to be here really soon. Alright, calmness slash exhaustion gone. Agatha jumped off the couch and stormed into her bedroom like a woman possessed. She pulled off her blouse, which was sweat stained from her cleaning marathon and put on a simple white longsleeve, before changing her tight jeans into wide black slacks. There. Comfortable, but not too casual. Her next task was her face, and then her hair. Agatha washed off her smudged makeup and gave her long locks a few strokes with her brush. But before she could even get started on applying new makeup, the sound of the doorbell rang through the house and straight to Agathas heart, which immediately started picking up the pace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, fuck, fuck.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>While she hurried through the hallway, her hand instinctively clutched the locket around her neck. It was the only comfort she could turn to right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hand landed on the door handle. Rio was right there, on the other side. Just a few inches away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took one last shaky breath. And then she pulled down the handle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, sorry, I know I'm a few minutes early, but-” Rios velvet voice made sudden room for a maddening silence, as she took in the woman standing in front of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted on her feet uncomfortably, unsure of what to say. This entire situation made her nervous to an indescribable degree, Rio apparently being thrown off by… she didn't even know what did very little to make her feel better.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a moment, Rio seemed to gain back some composure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm sorry, I just… I've never seen you without makeup on.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to give a snarky remark, something along the lines of “well, you have seen me a total of five times in your whole entire life”, but her tongue betrayed her. Rios comment suddenly made her feel small, shyly she messed with her hair, trying to draw some strands in front of her face to hide it, when the other woman suddenly sensed her mistake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, no, Agatha-” Instinctively, Rio reached out, her hands grabbing Agathas wrists and softly pulling them down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm so sorry, I just heard how that must have sounded to you, and I promise you, that is not how I meant it. I just was so stunned because… well, I knew you were beautiful, but </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, seeing you like this, it's… you're gorgeous, god.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn't know what to do. She felt the heat creeping up her neck and wanted to bury her face in her hands, but Rio still had a firm hold on her wrists, and god, did she not want her to let go. Ever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wish was not granted as Rio cleared her throat and released her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh, I'm sorry, I also just heard how that sounded and now you probably think I'm some sort of horny predator, coming over here after you called me all serious and the first fucking thing I do is lose it over seeing you barefaced. I'm sorry, I just-” Her voice trailed off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agathas brows furrowed. Was Rio… nervous? Was this self-assured, well-adjusted woman who had shown nothing but confidence actually… nervous? For some reason, this made Agatha actually feel a little calmer, and she managed a small smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Deciding to just move on from whatever just happened, she gestured for Rio to enter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come in. Do you want anything to drink?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well. They were doing this. Time to talk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After Agatha had set a cup of tea in front of each of them, she settled on her couch, facing Rio, who was sitting there cross-legged, leaning slightly against the far arm of the sofa. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” she said, picking up her mug. Agatha nodded, and then, it was silent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blew softly on her tea, and started taking little sips, while Agatha just looked at her. Took her in. Her head stumbled and her breath came in fast, shaky exhales. What the fuck was she even doing here? She had woken up this morning, her head hurting and her mind racing a million miles per minute already, and before she even got out of bed, she had remembered Rios message and she had remembered her call with Jen and she had remembered thinking that she needed to talk to Rio, and then she had pressed the call button on Rios contact and suddenly her voice was on the other side, and Agatha had almost started crying again, because apparently that was her default reaction to anything these days, and she had apologized for calling her mid breakdown the other day, and for not reacting to either of her texts, and then Rio had told her, in that fucking kind voice of hers, to slow down, but Agatha hadn't, she had kept rambling, and then she had said that she would be home from work around five today and that she would like to see Rio and talk, and Rio had answered that she had a client until six, but she'd be on her way immediately after, and now it was seven pm and Rio was sitting on her couch and sipping tea out of her mug and she was looking adorable and beautiful and confusing and Agatha wanted to scream, and she wanted her mind to stop spinning, and she really, really, just wanted Rios hands on her skin again, in the most innocent way, wanted her to grab her wrists, or touch her hand like she had done when handing Agatha her phone back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>God.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She was so fucked. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, are you alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rios voice came softly through the haze of Agathas thoughts. She considered lying for a second, considered playing it off, acting casual. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen thinks that I have a crush on you.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Alright, not casual then. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>There were a million reactions Agatha could have imagined. Rio spitting out her tea, gasping, Rio laughing at her, Rio being annoyed, Rio playing it off as something stupid… but of course, Rio being Rio, none of that happened. Instead, all she did was slowly set down her mug, and scooch a little, just a little closer in Agathas direction. Their knees were almost touching now, and Agatha felt very conflicted, craving that sliver of connection as much as wanting to retreat as far as possible. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rios voice sounded calm, her nervousness from earlier seemed to have faded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I denied it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told her that it was an insane insinuation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, is that the only word in your vocabulary today?” She hadn't meant to snap, but she was already on the edge, and if all she was getting from the other woman were those little scraps, it was hard to gauge what she was actually thinking, feeling, and it was driving Agatha mad. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, it's not. But I am waiting to say more until you have told me everything you wish to tell me. I have time, don't rush. I'm here, and everything is okay. You can just speak your mind, freely. It's alright, Agatha.” Of course her voice was still laced with gentleness, even after Agatha had lashed out. She almost wanted to say that there wasn't anything else she 'wished to tell her', but before the first word could leave her lips, she noticed that yes, there was. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Dang, Rio was good.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Living with my mother was an incomprehensible nightmare. I know this sounds dramatic, but I could start listing the ways she'd use to hurt me, to punish me, to humiliate me, and we'd still sit here in an hour because I wouldn't be done. Nothing I ever did was good enough for her. She got pregnant with me by accident, and it ruined her life. She never let me live it down, I was evil, bad, everything wrong in this world. Yes, those are all her words. She wished I would've been born dead, she used to say that she should have killed me the moment that I had left her body.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha spoke in a cold, calculated tone. After so many years, she felt detached to the horrible experiences that made up her earlier life. She knew that what happened was tragic, but she couldn't for the life of her bring herself to connect emotionally to it anymore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn't a thought that crossed her mind all too often, but sometimes she felt like maybe all the sorrow she was supposed to feel about her stolen childhood, she had already felt, that now there was no more, that now she was done. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just looked at her, her face unreadable, her hands on her knees, twitching slightly, as if they wanted to reach out, but didn't.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I came in touch with her fucked up worldviews pretty early on. I wasn't the only evil being in her eyes, this world was full of them. People who get divorced, people who are pro choice, homeless people, poor people, non-christians…” Agatha paused and took a deep breath. One look at Rio told her that she knew what would come next. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Queer people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, Rios eyes closed. Then, she scooted forward, just a tiny bit, but enough to close the distance between them, their knees now softly leaning against each other. She didn't say a word, but that simple gesture somehow was able to ground Agatha so much that when she continued speaking, her voice was steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think a part of me had always gravitated towards girls, I genuinely never had any interest in boys when I was a kid. At the age of 15, a girl I really… liked, asked me to go to homecoming together, and I said yes. Well, my mother found out, and that was pretty much the end of it. That day I learned that feeling for girls what other girls felt for boys made me bad. And all I wanted was to be good.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice threatened to get shaky again, but Agatha bit her lip and kept going. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So I told myself that what I felt for her, it wasn't real. That looking at girls, thinking about girls, it didn't mean that I wanted them in that way, the way my mother deemed so wrong. Eventually, I got caught up in that belief more and more, and I started to feel stupid thinking about how I used to be, how I used to… want her. I spent my life being with men, never long term, but everything else. From the age of 15, it was always them. Boys at first, men later, but always, always guys.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked down at her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn't inherit my mothers hatred for queer people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But you did internalize it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rios voice was barely above a whisper. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A wave of fear suddenly washed over Agatha, as if agreeing to Rios statement would make it all too real. She gathered all the courage she could find in herself, and challenged it into one word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, neither of them spoke. Suddenly, Agatha noticed that Rios hands had moved from her own knees to Agathas, resting softly on top of them, a calming presence in this storm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I feel so fucking stupid,” Agatha murmured. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Out of the corner of her eyes, she could see Rio immediately starting to shake her head, but before the other woman could even say a single word, she continued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I feel like… when I was young - a child, still, basically - I was pretty close to fully realizing and admitting to myself that I was…” She choked on the word. Rios hands turned upwards, and she slowly took Agathas in her own. She didn't say a word, but just feeling her warm, steady hands gave Agatha the strength to continue. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean, fuck, I had a whole plan of… kissing her… that girl, you know. On homecoming. I mean, that pretty much seals the deal, right, of me being…Why else would I want to? And I did want to, I did. I never got to. My mother had made it clear that even attending the ball with another girl would make me… bad. Evil. You can imagine how the idea of anything… physical… got tainted. In my entire life, I have never kissed someone who wasn't a guy, and now I am sitting here, at almost forty fucking years old, after spending decades telling myself and everyone around me that I was solely interested in men. Everyone believed me. And eventually, so did I. Kind of. And then you come around, and you make me doubt everything about the so carefully curated image of myself that I spent years building. Agatha Harkness, straight, not interested in dating, doesn't do relationships, fucks men and then moves on. Fuck, Rio, I look at you, and every last fiber of my being </span>
<em>
<span>screams</span>
</em>
<span> at me that none of that is actually true. And it's </span>
<em>
<span>terrifying</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt the tears hot behind her eyes and blinked them away in frustration. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing could have prepared her for what happened next. Slowly, Rio pulled her hands out from under Agathas, and, with the utmost care and gentleness, took Agathas legs and put them on the ground, so she could move right next to her. Rio gathered Agatha in her arms and softly stroked her hair, over and over again. Agathas head was resting against Rios chest and she could hear her heartbeat, slow, soothing. It should have felt uncomfortable to be this close to Rio, to be this vulnerable to her. But all she could think was how safe she felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha Harkness,” Rios voice was like balm to her broken soul and tired heart, “you are so, so good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with that, Agatha let the tears spill over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>☆</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn't know how much time had passed since she had started crying in Rios arms. All she knew was that the other woman held her, stroked her hair, and told her how good she was, over and over again, in that patient, velvety voice of hers. And now, finally, Agathas tears had stopped, and she moved away from Rio to look into her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She saw only kindness, and it suddenly made her realize that every word the other woman had whispered, every “you're so good” had been something Rio wholeheartedly believed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a soft hand, Rio cupped Agathas cheek, her thumb stroking over the trails of tear stains on her skin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know that doesn't erase the abuse you've had to endure, and it isn't enough to wipe out its ramifications. But for what it's worth, Agatha, I truly am sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And somehow, Agatha believed her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“In this current moment, is there anything else you want to share with me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha thought about it for a moment, really allowing herself to let Rios questions sit in her mind for a bit, before she eventually found an answer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” she said truthfully, and Rio nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want me to speak? Or would you prefer this conversation be paused for now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The gentle care in her voice, paired with how considerate, how kind Rio was being, genuinely asking her about her preferences, aiming to make Agatha as comfortable as she could possibly be, almost made her choke up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All she wanted was for Rio to speak. She didn't tell her that, but she did ask her to talk. And Rio obeyed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our sexuality… it is a beautiful thing. It is ours, and ours alone, to explore, to define, to name, and there is so much power in that. But the journey - it can be quite terrifying. What you have experienced, Agatha, it can leave scars for a long, long, long, long time. It can taint that journey that is supposed to hold so much beauty, to be so exciting, thrilling, really. I'm so sorry that opportunity got taken from you when you were young. But believe me - it is not out of reach for you, okay. That journey is, and always has been, yours. There is no timeline, no limit, to walk this road, it will always be right there, waiting for you. Whenever you're ready, you can take the first step. You know, I think you might have already done that anyways. And you're still here. You're safe, and you're so strong, and I am in awe of you. Truly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A single tear rolled down Agathas cheek. </span>
<em>
<span>God, all she did these days was cry, how wasn't she completely dried out by now?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm scared,” she breathed, “it feels so overwhelming, and I feel so fucking alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took her hand and squeezed it ever so gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha. I understand that it is scary. But I promise you, you do not have to do this alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked up at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you allow me, I will walk this road with you. I will guide you where I can, and I will be there every step of the way. You deserve to go on this beautiful journey, and I would be honored to embark on it right by your side.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jens words echoed in Agathas mind. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“There are a lot of women who could have been your sexual awakening. You are really fucking lucky that it's a woman like Rio Vidal.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah. She was really fucking lucky. </span>
