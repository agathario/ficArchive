<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness sat in the green room, her fingers tracing endless circles over her worry ring. The muted roar of laughter and applause from the studio audience beyond the curtain only made the familiar thrum of nerves in her chest more pronounced. Her heart raced, the rhythm as uneven as it always was before she stepped into the spotlight. This was routine for her—these pre-show jitters that tightened her throat and made her palms sweat. She’d learned long ago to channel them, to turn them into fuel for her chaotic stage presence. Still, no amount of success or accolades had ever dulled this moment: the quiet, vulnerable pause before everything began.</p><p>She absently smoothed a hand over her perfectly styled hair, an artful mass of soft, natural curls that framed her face. Deep rich chocolate sprayed with glitter that glinted faintly under the fluorescent green room lights—a detail that her stylist had insisted would "catch just right under the stage lights." Her makeup was bold and smudged to perfection, her dark eyeliner winged out in sharp points that seemed to echo the sarcasm in her tone whenever she spoke. Her outfit was every bit as deliberate: a cropped leather jacket over a black lace body, paired with high-waisted pants in a deep plum that hugged her long legs. Her heeled boots were scuffed just enough to give her look an edge of rebellion, like she’d just walked offstage at a concert but somehow managed to make it glamorous.</p><p>This was the Agatha Harkness the world knew: sharp, chaotic, untouchable. The industry loved to call her a force of nature, a wild card, someone who could throw out a sarcastic comment so perfectly timed it would dominate Twitter for days. Her fans had built her up into a myth, an icon who could do no wrong and she played into it when the cameras were rolling. What they didn’t see—what no one outside her tight circle of friends and family ever saw—was the girl sitting in this chair, fidgeting with more than one worry ring and chewing on the inside of her cheek.</p><p>The people closest to her, though? They knew the truth. They knew the version of her who called home every chance she got, who sent voice notes to her best friend at two a.m. because her anxiety was keeping her awake. They knew the version of her who swore she’d never get used to the noise of fame, who still jumped when fans screamed her name in public because a part of her couldn’t believe it was her they were screaming for. They knew the vulnerable, self-deprecating woman who needed to decompress with hours of reruns of NCIS after every show.</p><p>Her family—especially her mother, Lilia—had seen the cracks in the armor long before the world ever knew who she was. Agatha owed everything to her mom. She’d been the one to pull her out of the wreckage of her childhood, to show her what love and stability looked like after years of never knowing them. Growing up in an abusive home, Agatha had thought safety and happiness were things other people had, things she was never meant to touch. It wasn’t until Lilia had fostered her, then adopted her, that she realised there was more to life than surviving. Her mom’s belief in her hadn’t just saved her—it had built her, brick by brick, into the person she was today.</p><p>But sometimes, sitting alone like this, she still felt like the scared, angry teenager she used to be. She thought of Lilia now, of the quiet house she still called home, and felt a pang of homesickness so sharp it caught her off guard. That house wasn’t much—a modest two-story on a sleepy street—but it had always been enough. Whenever she walked through that door, the weight of the world fell off her shoulders. It was the one place where she wasn’t Harkness, the industry’s chaotic lesbian pop icon. There, she was just Agatha. Just Lilia’s kid.</p><p>A knock at the door jolted her out of her thoughts. “We’re ready for you, Harkness,” said a stagehand, their head poking through the doorway.</p><p>She nodded, shaking her hands out as if that would steady the tremble in them. “Alright,” she said, her voice stronger than she felt. Showtime.</p><p>Standing, she gave herself one last glance in the mirror. She looked every bit the pop star the world expected her to be: cool, collected, untouchable. And maybe, if she kept her sharp smile and quick wit at the ready, no one would notice the way her heart hammered against her ribcage.</p><p>But as she followed the stagehand toward the blinding lights of the studio, a quiet thought slipped through her mind: They don’t know the real me. They never could.</p><p>The bright stage lights hit her as she stepped through the curtains, her signature swagger firmly in place. The crowd erupted into cheers, and Harkness threw them a lopsided grin, waving exaggeratedly before sauntering over to the late-night host, James Cordon. Cordon stood to greet her, his easygoing charm a perfect foil for her chaotic energy.</p><p>“Harkness, ladies and gentlemen!” James said, gesturing toward her as she plopped down onto the plush chair across from him.</p><p>“Keep clapping,” she quipped, leaning into her mic. “It’s good for my ego.”</p><p>The audience laughed, and James smirked. “You’re already starting trouble, huh?”</p><p>“Trouble is my love language, James,” she said with a wink, crossing one leg over the other.</p><p>They launched into the usual banter—her new album, her tour, her reputation as a "chaos gremlin" both on and off stage.</p><p>Harkness delivered her sarcastic one-liners with the precision of a seasoned pro, keeping the audience in stitches. She was in her element now, using humor to dance circles around her nerves.</p><p>Then James leaned back in his chair, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. “So, Harkness, I heard you’re a big fan of dogs.”</p><p>Her brow arched. “I mean, who isn’t? Are you about to tell me you’re one of those people who prefers cats?”</p><p>“Oh no,” James said, grinning. “I like dogs, too. In fact…” He motioned offstage, and a stagehand wheeled out a small pen filled with squirming, tail-wagging puppies. The audience collectively cooed as the puppies tumbled over each other, yipping excitedly.</p><p>Agatha froze, her carefully constructed persona momentarily cracking. “…You did not.”</p><p>“I did.” James grinned. “These little guys are from a local shelter. They’re up for adoption, by the way. Thought we’d bring them out and see if they could charm you.”</p><p>“James,” she said, narrowing her eyes at him. “You’re trying to kill me on live television.”</p><p>The crowd laughed as James gestured toward the pen. “Go on. Take a look.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes, muttering under her breath, “You’re lucky I like you,” before sliding off her chair and crouching by the pen. The puppies swarmed her instantly, little bodies climbing over her knees and licking her hands. She let out a bark of laughter, her sarcastic edge softening into something almost vulnerable.</p><p>“Oh my god,” she said, fingers moving through soft fur. The puppies immediately clambered, licking her chin, and she made a sound that was dangerously close to a giggle. “This one’s plotting something. Look at her face. She’s pure evil.”</p><p>“She’s adorable,” James corrected, chuckling.</p><p>“She’s a con artist,” Harkness shot back, but her hand was already stroking the puppy’s soft fur. The puppy wriggled in her hands, turning to nuzzle against her neck. For all her sarcastic deflections, she looked besotted as she played with the dogs.</p><p>James leaned forward, grinning. “You’re ruining your whole persona right now, you know that, right?”</p><p>“What persona?” she said, raising an eyebrow. “I’m still the same chaotic, sarcastic menace you booked.”</p><p>“Uh-huh.” James nodded toward the puppies.</p><p>The audience erupted in laughter as Agatha sighed dramatically. “Fine. You got me. I’m a sucker for a puppy. Are you happy now?”</p><p>“Delighted,” James said. “So…think you might be taking one home tonight?”</p><p>She glanced down at the puppies. “Don’t tempt me, Cordon. My mom would kill me if I showed up with a dog.”</p><p>“Lilia’s watching this right now, isn’t she?” James teased.</p><p>“Absolutely,” Harkness said, looking directly into the camera. “Hi, Mom. Sorry in advance if I accidentally adopt a puppy.”</p><p>The audience howled with laughter, and Harkness reluctantly moved back to her chair.</p><p>Agatha Harkness leaned forward in her chair, continuing to watch the pen of puppies with a wary look that didn’t quite match the soft smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. The puppies, naturally chaotic themselves, were already testing the limits of their little enclosure. Their tiny tails wagged furiously, their yips echoing through the studio, making the audience practically melt.</p><p>“So, they’re just…loose now?” she deadpanned as James opened the pen and a couple of the braver pups stumbled out, tumbling over each other like furry little comedians.</p><p>“Oh, they’re fine,” James said, clearly enjoying the scene. “This is what late-night TV is for—pure chaos.”</p><p>“Chaos is my brand,” she muttered, watching one particularly bold tri-colored puppy bound toward her chair. She made a show of crossing her arms, pretending she wasn’t even looking at the tiny, wiggly creature. “Don’t come over here. I mean it.”</p><p>The puppy clearly did not speak English. It pawed at her boot, tiny nails scraping, and let out a pitiful whimper. Agatha glanced down, then quickly away, trying to maintain her composed (read: sarcastic and unbothered) persona.</p><p>“Oh no,” James said, spotting her hesitation. “You’re breaking, Harkness. That one’s got your number.”</p><p>“It does not!” she shot back, but her voice lacked its usual edge. She leaned down, as if to shoo the puppy away, but instead, her hand hesitated mid-air. The puppy pawed at her again, letting out a cry so dramatic it could have won an award. The audience collectively gasped in sympathy.</p><p>“Alright, alright, fine!” Agatha groaned theatrically, scooping the puppy up with exaggerated annoyance. “You win, tiny gremlin.”</p><p>The puppy immediately wriggled in her arms, licking her jaw with unrelenting enthusiasm. Agatha scrunched her face, trying not to laugh as she held the little dog at arm’s length. “Can you calm down? You’re making me look soft in front of millions of people.”</p><p>“That ship sailed, my friend,” James teased, smirking as the audience roared.</p><p>“Shut up, Cordon,” she shot back, even as the puppy burrowed against her chest. “This is purely a hostage situation. I’m not enjoying this at all.”</p><p>“You sure about that?” James asked, tilting his head.</p><p>“Nope. Not one bit,” she said, despite the fact that her hand had already settled into a rhythm, stroking the puppy’s fur. Its tiny body was warm and soft, and it had stopped wriggling now, nuzzling against her as if she was the only person in the world.</p><p>Agatha glanced down at the little dog, her expression softening, though she tried to hide it behind a smirk. “This one’s dangerous. Look at her. She’s plotting something.”</p><p>James grinned. “You’re absolutely in love right now. Just admit it.”</p><p>“No,” she said flatly, even as she adjusted her hold to cradle the puppy closer.</p><p>The audience was eating it up. By now, the other puppies had spilled out across the stage, causing delightful chaos as they sniffed James shoes and wandered toward the cameras. But Agatha barely noticed.</p><p>The little puppy had settled into her arms, letting out a tiny, sleepy sigh, and she was clearly losing the battle to maintain her unbothered exterior.</p><p>As they cut to commercial, James chuckled and said, “Alright, we’ll let Harkness and her new best friend have a moment.”</p><p>The lights dimmed slightly as the ad break began, and Agatha glanced down at the puppy, still nestled against her chest. She let out a long, dramatic sigh, reaching into her jacket pocket for her phone. Her thumb hovered over her contacts for a moment before she pressed the button to call Lilia.</p><p>The line rang twice before her mother picked up, her warm voice instantly putting Agatha at ease. “Hi, sweetheart! I’m watching—you’re doing great!”</p><p>“Don’t butter me up, Mom,” Agatha said, though her tone was more playful than annoyed. She leaned back in her chair, one arm wrapped protectively around the puppy as it slept. “I need to ask you something.”</p><p>“Oh no,” Lilia said, immediately catching on to her daughter’s tone. “What did you do?”</p><p>“I didn’t do anything,” Agatha protested, glancing at the puppy. “I just…there’s this dog.”</p><p>“The puppy your holding right now?” Lilia repeated, amusement creeping into her voice. “I knew it. I knew they were going to get you with the puppies.”</p><p>“Mom, this isn’t funny,” she said, though the corner of her mouth twitched. “This tiny menace has attached itself to me. I can’t just leave it here. It’s giving me…feelings.” She grimaced at the word, as though it were something foul.</p><p>Lilia laughed. “Agatha, you’re a grown woman. If you want to bring a dog home, bring the dog home.”</p><p>“Really? You wouldn’t mind, what about when I’m on tour?” she asked, a rare note of vulnerability slipping through.</p><p>“Of course not,” Lilia said gently. “You know there’s always room here for you—and anything you care about, I’ll look after it.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, blinking quickly before clearing her throat. “Okay. Cool. Thanks, Mom. You’re the best.”</p><p>“I know,” Lilia said with a smile in her voice. “Now, go finish the interview before that poor host has to wrangle the rest of those puppies by himself.”</p><p>Agatha hung up, tucking her phone away just as the stage lights flared back on. James turned to her with a knowing grin.</p><p>“Well? What’s the verdict?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, holding the puppy up like a trophy. “Looks like this one’s coming home with me. She cried until I caved. Typical.”</p><p>The audience erupted into cheers and applause, and for the first time that night, Agatha let her chaotic persona drop entirely, pressing a kiss to the puppy’s head. Maybe her fans were seeing a different side of her tonight, but as far as she was concerned, she didn’t care. This tiny gremlin was hers now, and she was already in love.</p><p>As the applause subsided and the interview wrapped up, Agatha leaned back in her chair, still cradling the tiny puppy in her arms. The little thing had dozed off, its head nestled against her shoulder, completely oblivious to the chaos it had just caused. James gave her an exaggerated grin as he turned back to the cameras.</p><p>“Well, there you have it, folks,” he said, gesturing toward her. “Harkness—pop icon, chaos incarnate, and now a dog mom. You love to see it!”</p><p>The audience roared, cheering and whistling as the show transitioned into its closing credits. Agatha gave a casual wave, her usual smirk firmly in place, though she couldn’t resist glancing down at the puppy, her expression softening for just a moment. She muttered under her breath, “You’re lucky you’re cute, menace.”</p><p>As the cameras cut, James leaned over with a sly grin. “You know, you’re not as tough as you pretend to be.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, standing with the puppy still snug in her arms. “Don’t start. I’ve got a reputation to maintain.”</p><p>James laughed. “Sure, sure. The big bad Harkness, cradling a puppy like a literal baby. Totally intimidating.”</p><p>She flipped him off without missing a beat, eliciting another laugh from him as she strode off the stage and toward the green room.</p><p>Once backstage, Agatha let out a deep breath, the adrenaline of the interview fading now that the cameras were off. Her team was already buzzing around, packing up her things and chatting about her next appearance, but she barely noticed. She carefully set the sleeping puppy down in a makeshift bed made from her oversized scarves, her fingers brushing over its tiny ears.</p><p>“Harkness?” Her assistant, Teen , approached with a clipboard in hand and an amused smile. “So, uh, what’s the plan for the newest member of your entourage?”</p><p>Agatha straightened, running a hand through her tousled hair. “First off, she’s not part of the entourage. She’s mine. Second…” She paused, glancing down at the puppy with a soft sigh. “I need supplies. Like, everything. Food, a bed, toys, whatever dogs need.”</p><p>Teen nodded, already making notes. “On it. I’ll have it all delivered to your place by the time you get home. What about a name?”</p><p>“A name?” Agatha blinked, caught off guard. She glanced at the puppy again, who let out a tiny snore. “I don’t know. I’ll figure it out later. Something dramatic. Maybe Tempest. Or Salem.”</p><p>Teen chuckled. “Very on-brand.”</p><p>Agatha smirked but didn’t respond, instead grabbing her duffel bag and heading for the dressing room. Once inside, she slipped out of her stage clothes and into something far more understated: a simple black hoodie, worn jeans, and sneakers. She pulled her hair into a loose bun, letting a few strands fall messily around her face. Finally, she reached for her glasses—oversized, round frames that covered most of her features.</p><p>The transformation was striking. Gone was Harkness, the sharp-tongued pop star who dominated headlines and award shows. In her place was Agatha, just Agatha, a woman who could slip through the world unnoticed if she wanted to. She took a moment to look at herself in the mirror, adjusting the glasses slightly, and let out a small breath.</p><p>Teen appeared in the doorway, holding the puppy. “Ready?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, reaching for the puppy and tucking her gently into her arms. “Yeah. Let’s go.”</p><p>On the ride home, Agatha scrolled through her phone, half-listening as Teen rattled off details about the puppy supplies he’d ordered. He had everything covered: a plush bed, food bowls, the highest-quality kibble money could buy, even a ridiculous array of toys.</p><p>“You really didn’t have to go all out,” Agatha said, though her tone lacked any real conviction.</p><p>Teen grinned. “You say that now, but wait until you see her in a tiny sweater.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, adjusting her glasses as the car pulled up outside the hotel she was staying at. It was late, and the street was mostly empty, but she still tugged her hoodie up over her head, shielding her face as she stepped out with the puppy cradled against her chest, ignoring the few flashes of the waiting paparazzi. Teen followed close behind, carrying the rest of her things.</p><p>Inside the hotel suite, Agatha set the puppy down on the couch, watching as it stretched, yawned, and promptly fell back asleep. She stood there for a moment, arms crossed, a rare smile creeping onto her face.</p><p>“Okay, menace,” she murmured, brushing a hand over the puppy’s fur. “Guess we’re stuck with each other now.”</p><p>She glanced at her phone, her thumb hovering over her mom’s contact again. For a moment, she considered calling, just to tell Lilia she was back to the hotel safe—and to gush a little more about the tiny creature now curled up on her couch. Instead, she set the phone down, grabbed a blanket, and settled in beside the puppy.</p><p>For the first time in a long while, Agatha felt…at peace. She didn’t need the persona, the chaos, the armor. Right now, it was just her, the puppy, and the quiet. And for tonight, that was enough.</p><p>As she slept, her fans flooded Twitter, responding to not only the interview but the hotel shots:</p><p>@LesbianPopStan:<br/>

<p>Agatha took a deep breath, letting the weight of her final interview roll off her shoulders as she stepped through the terminal. It was over—the endless press circuit, the exhausting late-night shows, the constant scrutiny of being Harkness. Now, for a few precious weeks, she could just be Agatha. No flashing cameras, no breathless questions about her next album, no expectations beyond what she wanted for herself. And what she wanted more than anything was to go home.</p><p>In her arms, Salem gave a soft whine, shifting slightly in her sleep. Agatha smiled, running a gentle hand over the cocker spaniel’s silky ears. In the month since she'd adopted her, the tiny pup had burrowed her way into Agatha’s heart with surprising ease. She was a quick learner—mostly. The training sessions squeezed into the chaos of Agatha’s schedule were already paying off, though Salem was still stubborn about certain commands. But if there was one thing the puppy had mastered, it was their walks. Three times a day, without fail, Salem would eagerly trot beside her, full of energy and curiosity. Agatha couldn’t wait to introduce her to Lilia.</p><p>The flight passed in a blur of exhaustion, and by the time she stepped out of the car onto the familiar pavement of her childhood home, a deep sense of relief washed over her. The house stood just as she remembered it—a warm, welcoming presence nestled in the safety of the gated community that had shielded her from prying eyes for years. The thought of slipping through the front door, of breathing in the familiar scents of home, of hearing Lilia’s voice, sent a rush of warmth through her.</p><p>She still remembered the first time she’d seen this house, standing on the doorstep at eleven years old, clutching a battered black garbage bag filled with everything she owned. She had been small, scared, and uncertain, and then the door had opened to reveal Lilia.</p><p>Professor Lilia Calderu , with her wild curls, ink-stained fingers, and sharp, knowing eyes. A professor of literature at Stanford, brilliant and eccentric, with a home filled with more books than furniture and a mind that never stopped whirring. She had taken Agatha in, had seen something in her—a spark of potential, of music, of something greater—and she had nurtured it. She had given Agatha not just a home, but a future.</p><p>Through every step of Agatha’s rise to fame, Lilia had been her quiet anchor. She never bragged about her daughter’s success to her colleagues, never reveled in the glamour of her career. Instead, she gave Agatha the gift of anonymity and stability, of knowing that when she came home, she wasn’t Harkness the pop star. She was just Agatha.</p><p>And now, standing at the threshold once again, Agatha lifted her hand and knocked, her heart pounding with anticipation. She couldn’t wait to see Lilia’s face when she finally met Salem in person, couldn’t wait to collapse into the familiar comfort of home.</p><p>The door swung open, and there she was—Lilia, eyes twinkling, lips already curved into a cheeky smile.</p><p>"You're home," Lilia said simply.</p><p>And for the first time in months, Agatha felt like she could breathe.</p><p>Agatha barely hesitated before stepping forward and wrapping her arms tightly around Lilia, burying her face in her shoulder. The familiar scent of old books and incense filled her senses, grounding her in the way only Lilia could.</p><p>"I'm home," Agatha murmured, voice thick with emotion.</p><p>Lilia chuckled, squeezing her gently before pulling back to study her. "You look exhausted," she said, brushing a stray curl of dark hair from Agatha’s face. "But happy."</p><p>Agatha grinned. "I am. And I brought a surprise." She shifted, adjusting the small bundle in her arms as Salem wriggled and blinked up at Lilia with sleepy, inquisitive eyes.</p><p>"Mom," Agatha announced, lifting the cocker spaniel slightly, "meet Salem."</p><p>Lilia's face lit up. "Oh, Agatha, she's precious." She reached out, letting Salem sniff her fingers before scratching gently behind her ears. "She better not pee on my floors!"</p><p>Agatha exhaled a laugh, shaking her head. "She won’t, she’s got potty training down already."</p><p>Lilia stepped aside, ushering them inside. "Well, let's get her settled then. Then you can tell me everything."</p><p>A few minutes later, they were outside in the back garden, a space that had always been Lilia’s sanctuary. The ivy-covered walls, the scattered terracotta pots overflowing with lavender and rosemary, the wooden bench where they had spent countless hours talking—it was unchanged, timeless, like everything Agatha loved about home.</p><p>Salem, now fully awake, was busy exploring, sniffing around the flower beds before flopping down on the grass with a satisfied huff.</p><p>Lilia handed Agatha a mug of chamomile tea before settling into the chair across from her. "So," she began, "three weeks until you leave again?"</p><p>Agatha groaned, sinking back into her seat. "Don't remind me. The tour is going to be just the states. It’ll be at least three months before I get another real break and then I’ve got the Europe tour."</p><p>Lilia arched an eyebrow. "Are you ready for all of that?"</p><p>"Honestly? I don’t know," Agatha admitted, staring down into her tea. "I love performing, but I hate everything that comes with it. The press, the travel, the constant pressure to be… Harkness. I barely get to be me anymore. Salem can come on the state tour but Europe - she’ll have to be left here."</p><p>Lilia sighed knowingly. "That’s why you have to hold onto moments like this," she said, gesturing to the garden around them. "These little pockets of normalcy. You need them."</p><p>Agatha smiled softly. "Yeah. I know."</p><p>For a moment, they sat in comfortable silence, sipping their tea, listening to the quiet rustling of leaves in the evening breeze.</p><p>Then Lilia spoke again, a teasing note in her voice. "Speaking of needing a break from your world, I’ve taken someone under my wing at work."</p><p>Agatha glanced up, intrigued. "Oh?"</p><p>"A new professor," Lilia explained, her eyes twinkling.</p><p>Agatha smirked. "Let me guess—she’s a lost cause when it comes to paperwork?"</p><p>Lilia laughed. "Completely. But she’s passionate about her work, which makes up for it. She’s got this fascination with plant life, could talk for hours about it if you let her."</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. "Sounds like someone I know."</p><p>Lilia sipped her tea, feigning innocence. "I have no idea what you mean."</p><p>Agatha chuckled, shaking her head. "So, is she just a work friend, or…?"</p><p>Lilia shot her a pointed look. "Agatha."</p><p>"What?" she asked, all innocence. "I'm just saying. You never talk about new people unless they actually matter to you."</p><p>Lilia laughed, “She’s about your age, young - you’d like her.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. "So, what’s her name?"</p><p>Lilia chuckled, setting her mug down on the table between them. "Her name is Rio - reminds me of myself when I was younger. I’ve been helping her navigate the politics of academia."</p><p>Agatha nodded, intrigued. "Rio. Cool name."</p><p>"She’s from Puerto Rico," Lilia said. "Moved here for the job. She’s young—your age, actually. A biologist. Shes a little intense, but in a way that makes you want to listen."</p><p>Agatha smirked. "So, basically, me if I studied biology instead of music?"</p><p>Lilia laughed. "Something like that. Oh, and you’ll appreciate this—when I visited her office the other day, she was listening to Harkness."</p><p>Agatha blinked. "Wait, what?"</p><p>"Your music," Lilia clarified, clearly amused. "She had her headphones in and didn’t hear me knock. I think it was 'Bitter'. She nearly jumped out of her chair when I startled her."</p><p>Agatha grinned. "Good taste. But… she doesn’t know about us, does she?"</p><p>Lilia shook her head. "Nope. Not a clue. She just started gushing about how brilliant Harkness is, how the lyrics in that song are criminally underappreciated. I just nodded along."</p><p>Agatha snorted. "You didn't say anything?"</p><p>Lilia shrugged, a mischievous twinkle in her eye. "Why would I? It’s not like I walk around campus introducing myself as 'Agatha Harkness’s mother.'"</p><p>Agatha groaned, but she was laughing. "Oh god, what if she finds out later and realizes she was ranting to my mom?"</p><p>"I’m looking forward to it," Lilia admitted, sipping her tea. "You should meet her while you’re home. I think you’d like her."</p><p>Agatha hesitated, glancing down at Salem, who was curled up in the grass, snoring softly. "Maybe," she said, though she was already curious.</p><p>Lilia just smiled knowingly. "We’ll see."</p><p>Agatha smirked but let it go—for now.</p><p>People liked to call her a heartbreaker, a serial flirt who left a trail of devastation in her wake. The truth was simpler, if less romantic. She never stuck around long enough to break anyone’s heart. One night, maybe two, then she moved on, slipping away before things could get messy. It wasn’t about conquest or carelessness—it was self-preservation.</p><p>The chaotic, untouchable persona she’d built wasn’t just for the cameras. It was armor. Letting someone in meant giving them power, and Agatha had learned early that love came with strings, with expectations, with the kind of vulnerability she couldn’t afford. It was easier this way.</p><p>At least, that’s what she told herself. Despite Lilia trying to push her into letting herself have something real.</p><p>As the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting a golden glow over the garden, she leaned back in her chair, soaking in the peace of home. She had three weeks before the whirlwind of her tour began, three weeks to just be Agatha. And she intended to make the most of them.</p><p>After catching up in the garden, Agatha stretched her arms over her head and let out a satisfied sigh. "Alright," she announced, pushing herself up from her chair. "I’m making dinner."</p><p>Lilia raised an eyebrow. "You? Cooking? Should I be concerned?"</p><p>Agatha gasped in mock offense. "Hey! I cook."</p><p>"You order," Lilia corrected.</p><p>Agatha scoffed. "Not true. I’ve picked up a few skills on the road." She scooped up Salem, who gave a sleepy yawn, and headed inside. "Come on, Mom, let me impress you."</p><p>The kitchen was as familiar as ever, warm and cluttered in a way that felt lived-in rather than messy. Recipe books lined a small shelf above the counter, well-worn from years of use. A bowl of fresh lemons sat beside a half-empty bottle of red wine, and the faint scent of old coffee lingered in the air.</p><p>Agatha tied her hair up in a loose bun, a few dark strands falling messily around her face, then rolled up the sleeves of her oversized sweater. Lilia, still amused by the whole affair, leaned against the counter in her usual worn jeans and an old Stanford sweatshirt, arms crossed as she watched her daughter move around the kitchen.</p><p>To her credit, Agatha actually did know what she was doing—mostly. She set to work making pasta from scratch, rolling out the dough with an enthusiasm that quickly turned the entire counter into a cloud of flour. Lilia eventually stepped in to help, which turned into more of a playful battle than a cooperative effort. By the time the dough was cut and set aside, they were both covered in white streaks, their laughter echoing through the house.</p><p>"Okay, okay," Agatha breathed, wiping flour from her cheek with the back of her hand. "Let’s document this masterpiece."</p><p>She grabbed her phone, angling it for a selfie. Lilia, still laughing, draped an arm over Agatha’s shoulder, her curls falling into the frame but her face just out of view. Salem, now awake and perched on the counter beside them, had a dusting of flour on her nose, looking equal parts confused and delighted.</p><p>Click.</p><p>Agatha studied the picture with a satisfied grin. The lighting was soft, golden from the evening sun streaming through the window. Her own face was flushed from laughter, flour smudged across her cheek. Lilia’s presence was there in the curl of her arm over Agatha’s shoulders, in the cascade of wild hair partially in view, in the warmth of the moment itself.</p><p>Without overthinking it, she posted the picture to Instagram with a simple caption:</p><p>home. ❤️</p><p>Almost instantly, the comments started rolling in.</p><p>@theharknessupdates: FLOUR? AGATHA IN A KITCHEN?? MOM ERA??</p><p>@fanofharkness: ok but who’s the mystery arm???</p><p>@musicjunkie98: girl we know you’re not cooking, don’t lie to us</p><p>@dogsofinstagram: MORE SALEM CONTENT PLEASE</p><p>Agatha laughed, setting her phone down as the pasta finished cooking. Lilia, oblivious to the online chaos, simply set the table and poured them each a glass of wine.</p><p>As they sat down to eat, Agatha exhaled, soaking in the feeling of home. No cameras, no pressure—just a messy kitchen, a happy puppy and the woman who had always been her safe place.</p><p>After dinner, Agatha helped clean up—well, half helped, mostly moving dishes around while Lilia efficiently wiped down the flour-covered counter. Salem had long since curled up in her dog bed in the corner of the kitchen, exhausted from the chaos of the evening.</p><p>By the time Agatha made her way upstairs, the weight of exhaustion had settled deep in her bones. The familiar creak of the wooden steps under her feet, the soft hum of the house at night—it was all so different from the hotel rooms and tour buses she was used to. Here, she could just be.</p><p>Pushing open the door to her bedroom, she was met with a wave of nostalgia. The walls were still the same soft lilac Lilia had let her pick out when she was fourteen.</p><p>Bookshelves lined one side of the room, crammed with everything from dog-eared paperbacks to old journals. A vintage record player sat on her dresser, a relic from her teenage years, and in the corner, her childhood acoustic guitar rested against the wall, its strings slightly out of tune.</p><p>She kicked off her socks, tugged off her sweater and pants and climbed into bed, sinking into the familiar softness of her old comforter. For the first time in what felt like forever, she wasn’t in a hotel, wasn’t in a city where someone was waiting for her to perform, wasn’t being watched. It was just her.</p><p>She sat up slightly, rubbing her hands together before carefully sliding off her worry rings—three silver bands she always wore, stacked on her right hand. A nervous habit. When the pressure got too much, when the noise of the world became unbearable, she’d spin them, feeling the cool metal against her skin, grounding herself.</p><p>But here?</p><p>Here, she didn’t need them.</p><p>She set them on her nightstand, exhaling as the tension in her shoulders slowly unwound. Lilia had left her bedroom door cracked open, just like she used to when Agatha was younger, and the faint glow from the hallway light pooled softly onto the floor.</p><p>Safe.</p><p>For the first time in months, Agatha closed her eyes without a worry or care in the world.</p>

<p>As the first week at home came to a close, Agatha decided to take Salem on a longer walk than usual. The fresh air felt good against her skin, cooling the warmth that had built up as she lost herself in thought. Dressed in casual sportswear:  cycle shorts, her oversized hoodie hanging loose over her frame, and her hair woven into simple braids with a few strands left loose to frame her face, she felt unrecognisable from the version of herself that lived in magazine spreads and on stage. It was a quiet kind of freedom.</p><p>By the time she made it back to the house, she was pleasantly tired, adjusting her clear-framed glasses as she stepped onto the driveway. That’s when she noticed the car. A sleek black SUV, parked neatly in front of the house. And leaning against it, scrolling absentmindedly through her phone, was a woman Agatha had never seen before.</p><p>She was gorgeous.</p><p>That was the first thing Agatha thought, her steps slowing instinctively. The woman had deep brown eyes, tanned skin, and shoulder-length dark hair that looked effortlessly tousled, the kind of beauty that seemed effortless. She wore fitted jeans, an olive-green T-Shirt that hugged her figure, and ankle boots. Agatha felt an odd little jolt in her stomach.</p><p>Was she a reporter? A fan who had somehow made it past the community gates?</p><p>Before Agatha could overthink it, the front door opened.</p><p>“Rio, thanks for agreeing to pick me up,” Lilia called out warmly.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>So this was the woman her mom had mentioned. Agatha kept walking, trying not to seem like she was scrutinizing Rio as she got closer. Before she could say anything, Rio looked up from her phone and did a quick double take, her eyes flickering over Agatha’s face like she was trying to place her.</p><p>“Wow,” Rio said with a small laugh. “You know, you look a lot like Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha stopped in her tracks, caught completely off guard.</p><p>Lilia, still halfway out the door, turned to look at her daughter, amusement flickering across her face before she bit it back. Agatha, on the other hand, blinked, not quite sure how to respond.</p><p>“I do?” she asked carefully.</p><p>“Yeah!” Rio said enthusiastically, stepping a little closer, clearly unaware that she was speaking directly to Harkness.</p><p>“I mean, it’s the glasses that are throwing me off a little, but you do. Same face shape, same kind of vibe.” She glanced at Agatha’s braids. “Hair’s different, though. But still, the resemblance is wild.”</p><p>Agatha fought the urge to laugh. She’d spent so much time carefully curating her public image—bold outfits, dramatic makeup, larger-than-life performances—that dressed down like this, she could slip right under someone’s radar was a definite bonus in her book.</p><p>Lilia, to her credit, said absolutely nothing.</p><p>“Huh,” Agatha said, playing along. “That’s kind of cool.”</p><p>“Are you a fan?” Lilia asked innocently.</p><p>“Oh, yes,” Rio said with a grin. “I was actually listening to her album on the way here. She’s insanely talented. I mean, I know pop stars get a lot of flack sometimes, but she’s the real deal.”</p><p>Agatha felt warmth creep up her neck, something about the sincerity in Rio’s voice making her stomach flip. It wasn’t like she hadn’t heard praise before, but there was something different about it when the person saying it had no idea they were talking to her.</p><p>Salem chose that moment to nudge at Rio’s leg, sniffing curiously at her boots.</p><p>“And who’s this cutie?” Rio crouched down, scratching behind his ears.</p><p>“That’s Salem,, she’s a demon” Agatha said, grateful for the momentary distraction.</p><p>“Lies,” Rio said, grinning up at her. “She’s perfect.”</p><p>Lilia let out a soft laugh. “Well, we should probably get going before traffic picks up, see you later child of mine,” she said, heading toward the car, waving backwards in Agathas direction.</p><p>Rio straightened up and gave Agatha one last look, still vaguely puzzled. “Seriously, the resemblance is wild. You should totally do one of those look a like competitions.”</p><p>“I’ll think about it,” Agatha said, biting her lip to keep from grinning.</p><p>Rio just shook her head with a laugh before slipping into the driver’s seat.</p><p>As Rio pulled out of the driveway, she glanced in the rearview mirror, catching one last look at Agatha standing there, hands stuffed into the pockets of her hoodie, one hip jutted slightly to the side. Even dressed down, she had a kind of effortless cool about her, something magnetic.</p><p>And those eyes.</p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose, shaking her head as she turned onto the main road. Lilia was flipping through the radio stations, seemingly oblivious to Rio’s momentary distraction.</p><p>“She’s really pretty,” Rio said casually, drumming her fingers against the steering wheel.</p><p>Lilia hummed in agreement. “Mhm.”</p><p>“Funny,” Rio mused, “because not only does she look like Harkness, but even her dog—Salem, right? She looks just like that puppy Harkness adopted when she was on the late show. I don’t know what hers is called though.”</p><p>Lilia fought back a smile, staring out the window as she replied, “That is a funny coincidence.”</p><p>Rio let out a short laugh. “If she ever wanted to get into impromptu lookalike work, she’d make a killing.”</p><p>Lilia turned to her then, an unreadable expression on her face, like she was enjoying some private joke. “You really are a fan, huh?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah,” Rio said, as if it were obvious. “Harkness is amazing. She actually writes her own music, which is rare enough, but she’s got this raw, emotional edge that makes everything feel so—ugh.” Rio gestured vaguely, at a loss for words. “Like, yeah, it’s pop, but it’s good pop. You can tell she actually cares about what she puts out.”</p><p>Lilia simply nodded, looking very pleased with herself. Rio narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“Okay, why do I feel like I just said something hilarious without realising it?”</p><p>Lilia just chuckled. “No reason.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that she was missing something.<br/>Still, her mind kept drifting back to Lilias daughter—the way her braids framed her face, the way her glasses slipped down her nose just slightly, the way she held herself, relaxed but with an undeniable confidence.</p><p>And those legs.</p><p>Rio had noticed them when she was walking up the driveway—toned, lean, the kind of legs that belonged to someone who either danced, ran, or had been blessed by the gods.</p><p>Focus, she scolded herself.</p><p>Lilia was her colleague, her friend. Ogling her daughter—who was probably younger than her, though Rio wasn’t sure by how much—was not the move.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, clearing her throat. “Your daughter’s back home for a bit, you never actually say her name, always just my daughter?”</p><p>Lilia nodded. “Just for a short break. She’s been busy, her names Agatha.”</p><p>“Stop shitting me. Doing what?” Rio laughed, thinking Lilia was playing into the look a like joke.</p><p>“Art and Writing.”</p><p>Rio’s lips quirked. “Like mother, like daughter.”</p><p>Lilia let out a small laugh. “Something like that.”</p><p>They rode in comfortable silence for a moment before Rio added, “She seems cool.”</p><p>Lilia turned to her, raising an eyebrow. “You like her.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “I just met her.”</p><p>“Doesn’t mean you don’t like her.”<br/>Rio huffed, gripping the steering wheel a little tighter. “I think she’s interesting.”</p><p>Lilia looked far too amused.</p><p>“Don’t.” Rio warned, but Lilia just smiled knowingly and turned up the radio.</p><p>Rio exhaled, focusing on the road ahead.</p><p>She definitely wasn’t thinking about ‘Agatha’s’ lips.</p><p>Nope. Not at all.</p><p>After Lilia left, Agatha stood in the kitchen, absentmindedly stirring a spoon through a tub of yogurt as Salem lay sprawled on the cool tile floor beside her. Her mind, however, was far from food.</p><p>She still couldn’t get over that interaction.</p><p>It wasn’t just that Rio had mistaken her for a Harkness lookalike—that was funny enough—but the way she’d said it. So casually, so certain. Like Agatha was just some regular girl who happened to bear a resemblance to a pop star, not the real deal standing right in front of her. And the way Rio had looked at her…</p><p>Agatha let out a frustrated groan and grabbed her phone, scrolling through her contacts before hitting FaceTime on Alice’s name.</p><p>It rang twice before her best friend’s face appeared on the screen, black and red hair messy from what looked like a long lie in.</p><p>“Ags,” Alice mumbled, voice thick with sleep. “Why are you calling me when I was in the middle of a very nice dream about owning a vineyard in Italy?”</p><p>“Because I just had the weirdest conversation of my life,” Agatha said, leaning against the counter.</p><p>Alice yawned and sat up. “Oh, this better be good.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, then launched into the whole thing—coming back from her walk, seeing the ridiculously attractive stranger outside her house, Rio’s very enthusiastic love for Harkness, and the way she’d spent the entire conversation completely oblivious to the fact that she was talking to her favorite pop star.</p><p>By the time she finished, Alice was fully awake, eyes wide.</p><p>“Oh my god.” She covered her mouth for a moment, then burst out laughing. “Agatha. No. You’re lying.”</p><p>“I wish I was,” Agatha groaned. “She literally said I should do one of those look a like competitions.”</p><p>Alice howled. “You should have told her! The look on her face would’ve been priceless!”</p><p>Agatha huffed. “And miss out on the fact that she thinks I’m some random cute girl who just happens to look like her favorite pop star? Absolutely not.”</p><p>Alice smirked. “Ohhh. So, she thinks you’re cute?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated. “I mean, she didn’t say that…”</p><p>“But she implied it.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, trying to play it cool. “I don’t know. Maybe.”</p><p>Alice grinned. “Oh, you like her.”</p><p>“I don’t even know her,” Agatha shot back, though her face was getting warm. “And she’s, like, my mom’s friend.”</p><p>“Hot friend,” Alice corrected.</p><p>“…Okay, yeah. Objectively hot.”</p><p>Alice leaned closer to the camera. “So let me get this straight. This hot, oblivious woman checked you out and is obsessed with your music and has no idea you’re you.”</p><p>“Basically.”</p><p>Alice clapped her hands together. “I love this.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “You would.”</p><p>“Oh, absolutely. And you have to see her again.”</p><p>“She’s my mom’s friend and colleague,” Agatha reminded her. “I’m sure I will.”</p><p>Alice smirked. “Well, when you do, you better keep this going. Don’t tell her anything.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t help smiling.</p><p>Yeah. She wasn’t planning on telling Rio anytime soon.</p><p>Later that afternoon, just as Agatha was scrolling through her phone, debating whether or not to order takeout, her phone buzzed with a call from Lilia. She answered without thinking, holding it to her ear as she stretched out on the couch, Salem curled up beside her.</p><p>“Hey, Mom.”</p><p>“Hey, sweetheart,” Lilia said, her voice warm. “I just wanted to give you a heads-up—Rio’s coming over for dinner tonight.”</p><p>Agatha bolted upright so fast that Salem gave her a side-eye before curling back into her nap.</p><p>“Wait, what?”</p><p>“I invited her,” Lilia said simply. “I thought you two got along.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, then closed it. We got along because she doesn’t know who I am, she wanted to say, but Lilia sounded way too pleased with herself.</p><p>“She doesn’t have to come for dinner,” Agatha pointed out.</p><p>“Well, she doesn’t, but she did drive me to work this morning and she seemed interested in getting to know you better.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach flipped. “She said that?”</p><p>“She said you seemed cool,” Lilia said, obviously grinning.</p><p>Agatha ran a hand over her face. “You’re enjoying this way too much.”</p><p>“I really am,” Lilia admitted. “Anyway, I figured you could cook tonight.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Why me?”</p><p>“Because,” Lilia said matter-of-factly, “you’re the one trying to impress her.”</p><p>Agatha spluttered. “I am not —”</p><p>“See you at six, honey. Love you!”</p><p>And then she hung up.</p><p>Agatha stared at her phone, then let out a groan, flopping back onto the couch.</p><p>Salem, entirely unimpressed by her dramatics, huffed and stretched out beside her.</p><p>“This is ridiculous,” she muttered.</p><p>Still, an hour later, she was standing in the kitchen, scrolling through recipes.</p><p>If she was going to do this, she was going to do this. Something easy but impressive.</p><p>Something that said, I’m effortlessly cool and vaguely mysterious but also really good at making food and therefore potential girlfriend material. Not that she wanted to be Rios girlfriend or anything.</p><p>She settled on a creamy garlic butter chicken with roasted potatoes and a side salad. Nothing too complicated, but good enough that she wouldn’t embarrass herself.</p><p>By the time six rolled around, the kitchen smelled incredible, the table was set, and Agatha had changed into something just a little more put-together—still casual, just not fresh off a walk around the block casual.</p><p>Salem perked up at the sound of tires on the driveway.</p><p>Agatha exhaled.</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>She barely had time to wipe her hands on a dish towel before the door opened. Salem, ever the excitable host, leapt off her spot by the couch and bolted for the door, her little tail wagging furiously.</p><p>Lilia appeared from the hallway, a knowing smile on her face as she passed by, followed closely by Rio.</p><p>Still gorgeous, still effortlessly cool, and now holding a bottle of wine.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, flashing a grin. “I didn’t know what you were making, so I just grabbed a red. Hope that works.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown. The woman had dimples. That was new information and potentially dangerous.</p><p>“Uh, yeah, that’s great,” she said, stepping aside. “Come in.”</p><p>Rio walked in, taking in the house with curious eyes. “This place is nice. Cozy.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Lilia took the wine from Rio with a smile. “I told you, you really didn’t have to.”</p><p>“Of course I did,” Rio said, shrugging off her leather jacket. “My mom would kill me if she knew I showed up to dinner empty-handed.”</p><p>Agatha, still processing leather jacket and dimples, only barely managed to register what Rio had said.</p><p>Before she could respond, Rio stopped abruptly, eyes locking onto Salem, taking her in properly. “She really does look like the puppy Harkness has.”</p><p>Lilia, conveniently busy uncorking the wine, said nothing.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “We, uh, get that a lot.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes. “That’s so wild. You’re basically a doppelgänger and your dog looks like hers? What are the odds?”</p><p>Agatha let out a weak laugh. “Crazy, right?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, still staring at Salem. “Crazy—”</p><p>“Dinner’s ready!” Lilia announced cheerfully, cutting off Rio’s train of thought.</p><p>Agatha exhaled in relief.</p><p>Rio gave Salem one last lingering look before standing. “Well, whatever the case, I’m taking this as a sign that Harkness and I are cosmically connected.”</p><p>Agatha really had to fight back a grin at that.</p><p>“Hope you’re hungry,” she said instead, gesturing to the table.</p><p>“Oh, always,” Rio said, flashing another one of those grins. “And honestly? I’m kinda impressed. Didn’t peg you for a cook.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, leading her to the table. “I have hidden depths.”</p><p>Rio slid into her chair, eyes glinting with curiosity. “Something tells me you do.”</p><p>Lilia shot Agatha a look as if to say I told you so.</p><p>Agatha just smirked.</p><p>This dinner was going to be very interesting.</p><p>As they settled at the table, Agatha tried to keep her cool, but Rio had this effortless way of taking up space—leaning back slightly in her chair, arms resting loosely on the table, her eyes flicking between Agatha and Lilia like she was genuinely curious about everything.</p><p>“This smells amazing,” Rio said, eyeing the creamy garlic butter chicken as Lilia poured them each a glass of wine. “Seriously, if you told me this came from a fancy restaurant, I’d believe you.”</p><p>Agatha, who normally didn’t care what people thought of her cooking, felt a ridiculous surge of satisfaction. “I like to cook when I have the time,” she said, serving herself a portion. “I used to do it more before… well, before things got busier.”</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow. “Busy with what?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated for a split second before saying, “Work.” Not technically a lie.</p><p>Lilia took a sip of wine, clearly holding back a smirk.</p><p>Rio hummed in understanding. “Makes sense. Your mom told me you’re a writer?”</p><p>Agatha nearly choked on her wine. A writer?That’s what Lilia had told her?</p><p>Lilia, utterly unbothered, buttered a piece of bread. “Mhm. She’s very creative.”</p><p>Agatha shot her mother a look, but Rio just nodded, seemingly interested. “What kind of writing?”</p><p>Agatha fumbled for an answer. She did write. Songs, mostly. But explaining that without exposing herself was tricky.</p><p>“Songs,” she said finally.</p><p>Rio’s lips quirked in a smile. “That tracks.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, cutting into her chicken. “You have that whole brooding artist thing going on. Kinda mysterious.”</p><p>Lilia let out a very undignified snort into her wine glass.</p><p>Agatha ignored her. “I do not have a brooding artist thing.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “You totally do, you could be famous if you tried.”</p><p>Lilia nearly choked.</p><p>Agatha clenched her fork tightly, doing her absolute best to stay composed.  “Yeah,” she said, forcing a casual smile. “Imagine that.”</p><p>Rio, completely oblivious to the irony, just grinned. “I’d be so into that.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach did a weird little flip. She needed to change the subject immediately.</p><p>“So, your a professor?” she asked, stabbing a piece of chicken.</p><p>Rio took a sip of wine. “Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “What do you teach?”</p><p>“Biology with a focus on Biochemistry, genetics and cell biology of plant-bacterial symbiosis” Rio said, swirling her glass.“Your mom’s the coolest professor on campus, by the way. Students love her.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “I believe it.”</p><p>Lilia waved a hand dismissively. “Oh, please.”</p><p>Rio turned her attention back to Agatha. “So, if you’re a writer, why not follow in your mom’s footsteps? Academia not your thing?”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath of laughter. “Not exactly.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, studying her. “You seem like someone who doesn’t like being tied down.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted slightly, caught off guard. She hadn’t expected Rio to read her like that.</p><p>“Something like that,” she admitted.</p><p>Rio’s gaze lingered for a second longer before she picked up her fork again. “Yeah. I get that.”</p><p>Lilia, watching the entire exchange like it was the most entertaining thing she’d seen in years, finally said, “She’s always been a free spirit.”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio mused. “Those are the best kinds of people.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure if it was the wine or the way Rio said it, but she suddenly felt very warm. She had a feeling this dinner was going to be harder to get through than she thought.</p><p>As dinner went on, Rio kept picking up on little things, laughing every time she found another coincidence, having finally been convinced that her name really was Agatha.</p><p>“So your name’s Agatha,” Rio said, twirling her fork between her fingers. “Not exactly a common name.”</p><p>Agatha sipped her wine, feigning nonchalance. “Nope.”</p><p>“And you happen to look like Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Guess so.”</p><p>“And your dog looks very similar to hers?”</p><p>Agatha forced a grin. “Weird, right?”</p><p>Rio let out a laugh, shaking her head. “No, this is actually insane. I mean, if I saw you on the street, I’d swear you were her. But here? I don’t know, you seem… younger.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Younger?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, gesturing vaguely. “Like, I don’t know, less… I wanna say polished? Not in a bad way! Just, like, you seem way more relaxed than she does. And you’re not wearing makeup, right?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched slightly around her fork. “Nope.”</p><p>Rio hummed, as if she’d solved some mystery. “That’s gotta be it. It’s like, Harkness is the pop star version and you’re the ‘chilling at home’ version.”</p><p>Agatha shot Lilia a subtle help me look, but her mom just smiled serenely and took another sip of wine.</p><p>“So, how old are you, anyway?” Rio asked, leaning her chin on her hand.</p><p>Agatha hesitated before answering. “Twenty-four.”</p><p>Rio sat back, nodding. “Oh, cool. You’ve got that, like, young creative energy. Makes sense.”</p><p>Agatha frowned slightly. “How old did you think I was?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio admitted. “You’ve got this kind of confidence that makes you seem older, but like… I also thought maybe twenty-two? You just have that fresh-out-of-college vibe.”</p><p>Lilia bit down a smile behind her wine glass.</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose. “And you?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Twenty-nine. A whole five years wiser.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Right.”</p><p>“I’m serious!” Rio grinned. “Not to brag, but I give excellent life advice.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Oh yeah? What’s your best piece of wisdom?”</p><p>Rio considered. “Hmm. Okay. My best advice? Always have a backup lighter, never date a philosophy major, and—” she pointed at Agatha’s glass “—always let red wine breathe before you drink it.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help it—she laughed. “Wow. Life-changing.”</p><p>Rio winked. “Told you.”</p><p>Lilia, still highly entertained, finally chimed in. “Rio, do you think you’d recognize Harkness if you saw her in person?”</p><p>Rio snorted. “Uh, yeah. I’d like to think I know my favorite singer’s face.”</p><p>Agatha nearly choked on her drink.</p><p>Lilia smiled into her glass. “Fascinating.”</p><p>Rio glanced between them, frowning slightly. “Why do I feel like I’m missing something?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “No reason.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes but didn’t push.</p><p>Instead, she sat back, still grinning. “You know, this has been by far the most interesting dinner I’ve had in a while.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, finally relaxing just a little.</p><p>“Oh, trust me,” she said, swirling her wine.  “You have no idea.”</p>

<p>The weekend drifted by in a haze of quiet mornings in the garden, Salem’s lazy afternoon naps at her feet, and Agatha’s mind constantly circling back to Rio.</p><p>She couldn’t stop thinking about dinner.</p><p>The way Rio laughed so easily, like she really felt things when she found something funny. The way she seemed so damn intrigued by Agatha—unintentionally dissecting her personality without even realizing she was talking to the person she’d been gushing about. And then there was the way she’d looked at her.</p><p>Not in an oh my god, you’re Harkness way. In a you’re really interesting, and I want to know more kind of way. That was new. And then, of course, there was the number exchange.</p><p>“Hey, I had fun tonight,” Rio had said as she was leaving, standing just outside the door with her jacket slung over her shoulder. “You’re cool, Calderu. We should hang out sometime.”</p><p>Agatha, startled at the surname but playing it cool, had smirked. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio had said, pulling out her phone. “Gimme your number.”</p><p>And just like that, Agatha had handed it over, watching Rio type it in and shoot her a quick ‘Hey’ text just to lock it in. That had been Friday evening.</p><p>Since then, Rio had actually used the number, which Agatha honestly hadn’t expected. Nothing crazy—just a few casual messages here and there.</p><p>Rio: Okay, real talk, what do you put in that garlic chicken? I tried to make something similar and it was NOT the same.</p><p>Agatha: You probably didn’t use enough butter.</p><p>Rio: Butter is the answer to all things, huh?</p><p>Agatha: Pretty much.</p><p>Rio: Noted.</p><p>Or, last night:</p><p>Rio: Salem is seriously Harkness’ dog’s long-lost twin. If you ever need a side gig, you should take her to fan conventions and charge for pictures.</p><p>Agatha: Noted. I’ll start making merch.</p><p>And then, this morning:</p><p>Rio: You doing anything today?</p><p>Agatha stared at that one a little longer. Because, technically, no—she wasn’t doing anything today. But she should be.</p><p>She only had two weeks left before tour, and she was supposed to be spending this time finishing up her new material, mentally preparing for months on the road, and staying out of the public eye while she still had the chance. Instead, she was lying on a lounge chair in the backyard, staring at Rio’s text like a total idiot.</p><p>Alice’s voice rang in her head ‘Ohhh, you like her.’ Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose and finally typed back.</p><p>Agatha: Depends. Why?</p><p>The response came quickly.</p><p>Rio: Because I’m about to go get coffee, and if you say no, I’m gonna have to sit alone and look like a loser with no friends.</p><p>Agatha smirked.</p><p>Agatha: Tragic. Can’t have that.</p><p>Rio: Exactly. So?</p><p>Agatha hesitated just a little longer than necessary, weighing up the pros and cons  before replying.</p><p>Agatha: Where are we going?</p><p>Rio: There’s a place near the park I like. I’ll pick you up in 20?</p><p>Agatha looked down at herself—shorts, a hoodie, hair a little messy but still in its usual braids. She looked… normal. Unrecognisable.</p><p>And for some reason, that made her say:</p><p>Agatha: Yeah, okay. See you then.</p><p>As soon as she sent it, Salem stretched beside her with a lazy yawn, like she already knew she was about to leave. Agatha sighed, scratching her ears.</p><p>“This is such a bad idea.”</p><p>But she was already getting up to go change.</p><p>Agatha shuffled into the house, glancing once more at her phone as she made her way upstairs. Her heart was already doing that funny fluttering thing that only happened when she was about to step outside of her comfort zone. She threw open her closet, staring at the array of clothes that suddenly felt like they had no purpose at all. Was she overthinking this? Probably. But something about Rio made her feel… different.</p><p>She picked out a simple, vintage fitted black T-shirt, paired it with distressed jeans, and opted for sneakers. It was casual, but not too casual. At least, that’s what she told herself. She pulled her braids out of the messy bun they’d been in and ran her fingers through her hair, smoothing it down. A few strands rebelled, but she ignored them. She could already tell this wasn’t going to be some meticulously planned outing. It was going to be an easy, no-pressure coffee meet-up. No expectations.</p><p>Still, she couldn’t shake the feeling of being a little underdressed. When Rio had met her at dinner, she’d been in one of those oversized sweaters and glasses, barely putting any effort into her appearance. This time, even though Agatha was sticking to her comfort zone, it felt like she was already a step closer to… something.</p><p>She glanced at the clock. Twenty minutes.</p><p>Sighing, Agatha gave Salem one last pat and walked down the stairs. “Stay here, baby. I’ll be back in a bit,” she muttered, giving her a final scratch behind her ears.</p><p>She grabbed her phone and slipped it into her pocket, the weight of it oddly reassuring in her hand. As soon as she stepped out of the house, the fresh air hit her, and she found herself taking a deep breath, trying to calm the mild buzz of nervous energy that had settled in her chest.</p><p>As she walked to the driveway, she spotted Rio’s car pulling up. Rio, looking effortlessly cool as usual, her dark hair slightly tousled from the wind. She spotted Agatha immediately and gave her a grin that made her stomach flip.</p><p>“Hey, Calderu,” Rio greeted, her voice warm and easy. “You’re on time, impressive.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a playful smile and slid into the passenger seat. “You’re just early. Not sure if that’s a you thing or a me thing.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, turning the key in the ignition and pulling out of the driveway. “I’m usually early. Bad habit, I guess.” She glanced over at Agatha with a quick smile. “You look good, by the way.”</p><p>Agatha felt a flicker of warmth in her chest at the compliment, but she played it off with a casual grin. “Thanks. This is just... my ‘I’m not trying’ look.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flickered to her, and Agatha could’ve sworn there was a spark of amusement there. “Yeah, well, it works. I’ve always admired people who can pull off that effortlessly cool vibe.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, settling back into her seat. “Guess I’m just lucky.”</p><p>As they drove through the winding streets, the chatter between them flowed easily, nothing forced. Rio told Agatha a little more about her work at Stanford, how she’d initially thought she'd be a research scientist, but fell in love with teaching instead. Agatha listened intently, surprised by how much she was enjoying the conversation. The fact that Rio wasn’t treating her like some kind of untouchable celebrity was refreshing.</p><p>They reached the coffee shop in no time, a small café tucked near the park, with mismatched tables and chairs lining the front patio. Rio pulled into a parking spot, then got out and came around to open the door for Agatha.</p><p>"After you, Calderu,” Rio said with a teasing grin, clearly amused by the rhyme.</p><p>Agatha smirked and slid out of the car, adjusting her jacket before following Rio inside. The café was cozy, with the rich smell of fresh coffee filling the air. It wasn’t the type of place where people lingered for hours, but the atmosphere was warm and laid-back. Agatha immediately felt at ease.</p><p>They stood in line together, both scanning the menu. Rio glanced at her with a raised eyebrow. “What’s your go-to order? I feel like you’re one of those ‘secret menu’ people.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, the sound escaping before she could stop it. “I wish I was that cool. Nah, I just get a regular cold brew. I’m pretty basic like that.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Basic is good. It’s consistent.”</p><p>They both ordered their drinks, Agatha sticking with her usual cold brew and Rio opting for a cappuccino. As they waited for their drinks, Agatha found herself stealing a glance at Rio every so often, noticing the way she moved, the way her eyes sparkled when she spoke about something she was passionate about. The conversation flowed with ease, and yet, Agatha’s heart was racing just a little faster than usual.</p><p>Once their drinks were ready, they grabbed a small table by the window, overlooking the park. Rio leaned back in her chair, swirling her cappuccino. Agatha’s heart skipped a beat and for a moment, the world outside the café felt like it was fading away. This wasn’t just a coffee date anymore. She wasn’t sure what it was turning into, but it was something that she wasn’t ready to walk away from.</p><p>She just didn’t know what to call it yet.</p><p>Agatha sat back in her chair, her fingers tapping lightly against her cold brew cup, trying to shake off the sudden shift in her chest. There was something about Rio's gaze that made her feel both seen and nervous all at once. M</p><p>They sat in a comfortable silence for a moment, sipping their drinks. The hum of conversation and clinking of cups around them created a peaceful backdrop, but Agatha’s mind was racing. Every so often, she’d glance at Rio, only to find Rio looking back at her with that easy, relaxed smile, her attention unwavering.</p><p>“So, what about you?” Agatha asked, eager to learn more about the woman. “What made you decide to go into teaching, anyway?”</p><p>Rio seemed to brighten at the question. “Oh, that’s easy,” she said, setting her cup down and leaning in a little. “I mean, I started out in research, but I realized pretty quickly that I like helping people more than I like staring at data all day. Teaching gives me the chance to see someone’s lightbulb moment. You know, when they get it? When it clicks?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, intrigued. “That must be a pretty awesome feeling, actually. I mean, seeing someone understand something for the first time—it’s got to be rewarding.”</p><p>“It really is,” Rio said, her voice warmer now, more animated. “There’s nothing like it. You know, I always thought I’d be in a lab, deep in the weeds of some data or project, but then I realized... I wasn’t happy. I wanted to see people grow. To see their potential. And teaching? It’s kind of like being a guide to help them realize that for themselves.”</p><p>Agatha was impressed. There was a genuine passion in Rio’s voice, a commitment to her students that Agatha didn’t expect but admired all the same. The intensity with which Rio talked about teaching made Agatha feel like she could almost see it—Rio standing at the front of a lecture hall, completely in her element.</p><p>“You’re good at that, huh?” Agatha asked, the words slipping out before she could stop them. "I mean, you sound like you're really into it."</p><p>Rio smiled, and Agatha swore she caught the faintest blush rising on her cheeks. "I try," she said, a little bashfully. "I think I just found something I care about. It wasn’t really what I expected, but it’s been the right fit."</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, taking another sip of her drink. Her thoughts briefly flashed to her own life—how her career had unfolded in a whirlwind, where each step had been a result of something bigger than just herself. Harkness had taken over in ways that sometimes felt out of her control. And now, sitting here, it was easy to feel like she was on the outside of her own life, watching it all from a distance.</p><p>She pushed those thoughts aside. Today wasn’t about her career, not about the expectations that came with being in the public eye. Today was about this. About Rio.</p><p>“Well, I’m glad you found it,” Agatha said, her voice softening. “Sounds like you really love it.”</p><p>Rio’s smile deepened, but there was something else in her eyes now. A flicker of something warmer, softer. She leaned in, elbows on the table. “Thanks. Honestly, I think the same about you. You seem like someone who knows exactly what they’re doing. Even if you’re not saying it.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped. She didn't know how to respond to that, so she just stared at Rio for a beat too long, unsure of what she was feeling. Was this something more?</p><p>Before Agatha could say anything, Rio’s phone buzzed on the table, breaking the silence. She glanced down at it, sighing lightly. “Sorry, that’s my colleague from work. I should probably take this.” She smiled at Agatha before picking up the phone. “One second.”</p><p>Agatha watched her, her chest still fluttering with a nervous excitement she couldn’t fully understand. Rio seemed to be unaware of the effect she was having on Agatha, focused entirely on the conversation on the other end of the line. The way Rio spoke was so calm, almost soothing, and Agatha found herself just watching her, the way her lips moved when she smiled at something the other person said.</p><p>It didn’t take long for Rio to hang up, and when she did, she gave Agatha a sheepish smile. “Sorry about that. Plant emergancy.”</p><p>“No problem,” Agatha said, though her mind was still elsewhere, still caught on Rio. "Everything okay?"</p><p>“Yeah, just some last-minute prep work for a project next week,” Rio explained. “The usual stuff.”</p><p>The words barely registered as Agatha nodded along, still lost in the quiet, charged space between them. They sat in silence for a few moments, sipping their drinks, the tension between them like a thread pulled tight.</p><p>Finally, Rio broke the silence, her voice a little softer than before. “So, Agatha... What’s your deal? You’ve been quiet. You have any secrets?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the question. “Secrets? You mean like, besides the fact that I’m a terrible baker?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, a playful smile tugging at her lips. “I’m betting that’s a lie.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, relaxing a little. “I mean, I do okay. It’s just—what’s the fun in being perfect, right?”</p><p>Rio leaned forward again, her expression more earnest now. “I don’t know... I kind of think you are perfect the way you are.”</p><p>The words hung in the air, heavy with meaning. Agatha’s breath caught, and for a moment, it felt like time slowed down. Rio wasn’t just teasing her anymore. This felt real. The connection between them—whatever it was—felt like it was about to shift into something else entirely.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to say something, but the words didn’t come out. Instead, she just stared at Rio, her heart pounding in her chest.</p><p>“I—uh...” Agatha stammered, not entirely sure what to say. She could feel the pull, could feel something changing between them, but she wasn’t sure she was ready for whatever it was.</p><p>Rio seemed to read the hesitation in her eyes. “Hey, no pressure,” she said softly, her tone reassuring. “I’m just saying, you’re someone I’d want to get to know better. That’s all.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her pulse quickening. She didn’t know where this would lead, but right now, she didn’t want to pull away. Not from Rio, not from this moment.</p><p>Instead, she just nodded, giving Rio a small, tentative smile. “I think I’d like that too.”</p><p>The drive back home felt quicker than Agatha expected, her mind still buzzing from the coffee date. It wasn’t just the conversation with Rio that had her head spinning—it was the way Rio made her feel. Seen. Rio had looked at her as if she was just a person. A real, normal person.</p><p>She wasn’t sure if she was ready to dive into all of those feelings yet, but she definitely wasn’t going to keep it to herself. At least not all of it.</p><p>Agatha entered through the back door, closing it softly behind her. The house was quiet, just like it had been all weekend, but the familiar comfort of home was a welcome sight after the whirlwind of the day. She tossed her jacket over the chair and padded into the kitchen, where she found Lilia at the counter, sipping on a glass of wine.</p><p>“Hey, how was your coffee date?” Lilia asked casually, glancing up at Agatha with a smile.</p><p>Agatha paused in the doorway, surprised at how easily her mom picked up on her mood. Lilia had always been perceptive, and Agatha had no doubt she was aware something had shifted. Still, Agatha wasn’t quite sure how to talk about Rio without everything coming out all at once.</p><p>“It was... good. Really good, actually,” Agatha said, leaning against the counter. She tried to keep her tone neutral, but she couldn’t fully mask the smile that tugged at the corners of her lips. “We had coffee, talked for a while. She’s—uh—interesting. I like her.”</p><p>Lilia raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. “You like her? More than just the fact that she’s interesting?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, leaning against the counter with a soft chuckle. “I don’t know. It’s just... I don’t know. It’s like she actually sees me, you know? The real me.”</p><p>Lilia set her glass down and gave her daughter a knowing smile, folding her arms across her chest. “I think I understand. You’ve always had this... wall up with new people, Agatha. People see you in one light, and it’s hard to feel like they truly get who you are underneath all of that.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, suddenly feeling vulnerable. “Yeah, exactly. With Rio, it didn’t feel like she was trying to figure out some mystery or putting me in a box. She just—treated me like a normal person.”</p><p>“Well, that’s a good thing, right?” Lilia said softly. “You deserve to feel like you’re seen for who you really are.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her throat tight with a mix of emotions. It was one thing to feel seen by someone else, but it was something entirely different when her mom was talking about it so openly.</p><p>“I guess so. It just feels… strange. I don’t know if it’s because I’m not used to it, or if there’s something more there that I’m not ready to deal with yet.”</p><p>Lilia’s smile softened, and she walked over to Agatha, placing a hand on her shoulder. “It’s okay to take your time with this. You don’t need to rush. But you’ve been working so hard for so long that you deserve to be happy, Agatha. And sometimes, that happiness can come from unexpected places.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, her mom’s words sinking in. “I know. It’s just... I don’t know what to do with any of this. She doesn’t even know who I am. She just thinks I’m your daughter, she keeps calling me Calderu.”</p><p>Lilia raised an eyebrow. “You didn’t tell her?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, feeling her cheeks heat up. “I didn’t think it was the right time. I mean... it’s complicated. I’m not ready for her to know. I don’t want to make it weird or anything.”</p><p>“I get that,” Lilia said thoughtfully. “But I think if you keep letting that part of yourself stay hidden, it’s only going to make things more complicated in the long run. You deserve to be seen for all of who you are, Agatha. Not just the parts you let people see.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing her temples. “I know, Mom. It’s just hard. I don’t know how to explain it, but... Rio makes me feel like I’m not Harkness, you know? She doesn’t care about that part of me. And I kind of like that.”</p><p>“I get it. But she will eventually, won’t she?” Lilia asked, her voice soft, understanding.</p><p>“Eventually,” Agatha said quietly. “I just... I don’t know if I’m ready for her to know. Or if I should even tell her. It’s just so much, and it changes everything.”</p><p>Lilia nodded slowly. “I know it’s a lot. But just remember—whatever you choose to do, you don’t have to do it alone. And you don’t have to figure it all out today. Take it one step at a time, okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, feeling a little lighter, a little less burdened by the weight of her own thoughts. It helped just to talk about it with someone who understood.</p><p>“Thanks, Mom,” she said quietly, giving her a small smile. “I needed that.”</p><p>Lilia smiled back warmly. “Anytime, sweetheart. I’m proud of you.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart warmed at her mom’s words. It wasn’t often she let herself feel proud of what she’d done, but in this moment, hearing her mom’s encouragement felt like it was enough.</p><p>“So, what are you going to do now?” Lilia asked, her voice light and teasing, trying to steer the conversation back to something more casual.</p><p>Agatha shrugged, trying to act cool. “I don’t know. Probably hang out with Salem for a bit. She’s been giving me that ‘I’m lonely’ look since I walked in.”</p><p>Lilia laughed, taking a step back. “Well, you can’t leave her hanging. But I’ll be around if you need me.”</p><p>Agatha smiled at her mom, feeling a wave of gratitude. “Thanks. I’ll figure it out.”</p><p>And with that, she headed to the living room, her mind still buzzing with thoughts of Rio, but now with a little more clarity. Maybe she didn’t have everything figured out, but for the first time in a long while, it felt like she was headed in the right direction. Whatever that direction was, she was ready to see where it went.</p><p>The next few days passed in a blur of messages and casual chats between Agatha and Rio. Their conversations flowed easily, like they were picking up where they left off each time, and Agatha found herself looking forward to each new text with a sense of excitement that she hadn’t felt in a while.</p><p>It started off simple enough:</p><p>Rio: Salem’s still living her best life, huh?*</p><p>Agatha: Always. She’s already on her second nap of the day. I think she's on to something.[picture of Salem curled up on the couch]</p><p>Rio: That’s it. I need Salem in my life. How do I get a dog that looks exactly like Harkness’ puppy?*</p><p>Agatha: You’re not getting Salem, sorry. She's got exclusive rights to the “Harkness’ Puppy” title.</p><p>Rio: Fair enough. I'll just keep stealing her cuteness through your texts.</p><p>Agatha: You could just come hang out with her in person 😜</p><p>Rio: I mean, if I get to hang out with you too, that sounds pretty perfect.</p><p>Agatha paused when she read the text, a smile creeping onto her face. She could feel the spark between them every time they talked, but there was something in Rio’s tone this time that made it feel… different. More sincere.</p><p>Agatha found herself staring at her phone again. They’d been texting back and forth all day—casual stuff, funny memes, and Salem photos—but she couldn’t shake the feeling that she was holding something back from Rio.</p><p>She had less than two weeks before she had to leave, and she knew it wasn’t just the days counting down—she was counting down the moments until she had to make a decision.</p><p>Should I tell her?</p><p>It was becoming harder to ignore the growing tension. Agatha had gotten used to people seeing her as a persona—a celebrity, an icon—but Rio hadn’t done that. She had looked at Agatha with curiosity and warmth, and though Agatha wasn’t ready to let go of her “Calderu” identity just yet, she couldn’t avoid it forever.</p><p>And what if it went wrong? What if Rio couldn’t see past the Harkness part of her? What if this all fell apart just because of one truth that had to come out?</p><p>Her phone buzzed again, pulling her from her thoughts. It was Rio.</p><p>Rio: So, when are we going on another coffee date? You know, just so you can subject me to more of Salem’s adorable antics?</p><p>Agatha smiled, her heart racing a little faster. She loved how easy it felt to talk to Rio. How normal everything was, even if it wasn’t.</p><p>Agatha: How about this Wednesday? We can take Salem to the park and get coffee afterwards. I’m sure she’s ready for a playdate.</p><p>Rio: It’s a date. I’ll be there, ready for all the cuteness and coffee.</p><p>The exchange left Agatha with a light feeling in her chest, but also a twinge of uncertainty. She knew she couldn’t keep her identity hidden forever, and every time she texted Rio, that weight grew heavier.</p><p>As the days went by, their chats continued to grow more personal. They talked about everything—things Agatha had never talked about with anyone else. Rio was easy to talk to, a natural listener, and her jokes and playful teasing made Agatha feel like she was just having fun, not worrying about who she had to be.</p><p>But the nagging question never left her mind: When do I tell her?</p><p>One night, after another long texting session, Agatha found herself staring at the last message from Rio, her fingers hovering over her phone. It had been a great conversation, nothing out of the ordinary, but that tight feeling in her chest was back.</p><p>Rio: I like getting to know you, Calderu. You’re a lot more interesting than I thought.*</p><p>Calderu—it stung in a way it hadn’t before. The reminder that Rio didn’t know who she was, what she did, who the world thought she was, weighed heavily on Agatha.</p><p>It had been so easy to slip into the role of “Calderu’s daughter”—a person who was only half her. But now, with every text from Rio, it felt more and more like Agatha was hiding in plain sight.</p><p>She ran a hand through her hair, setting the phone down beside her, and leaned back against the couch.</p><p>Her phone buzzed again, a new message lighting up the screen.</p><p>Rio: I know I asked this last time, but really... I’m curious. What’s your favorite thing to do when you’re not working?*</p><p>Agatha thought for a long moment before she typed out a response.</p><p>Agatha: I like to write music. When I’m not recording, or working on a song for the tour, I write for fun. Sometimes just in my journal. A lot of people don’t know that about me.*</p><p>She hit send before she could overthink it, and then sat back in her chair, feeling a little lighter.</p><p>Moments later, Rio replied.</p><p>Rio: For the tour? Wait, what? Why didn’t you tell me this before?</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, knowing it was time.</p><p>Agatha: Well... I didn’t exactly want to surprise you with it. But yeah, tour, I write and perform my own music.</p><p>A long pause followed. Agatha felt her heart beat louder in her chest as she waited for Rio to respond. Was it a mistake?</p><p>Finally, the reply came.</p><p>Rio: That’s amazing. Very Harkness of you. Seriously. I don’t know why, but it makes me think I don’t know you at all. It’s like... you’re more than just this person I’ve been texting</p><p>Agatha’s heart thudded in her chest. She exhaled sharply, thinking of the next words.</p><p>Agatha: I guess there’s more to me than just the being Lilia Calderus kid. But it’s complicated...</p><p>Rio: What do you mean?</p><p>Agatha: It’s just... I haven’t exactly told you the full truth about who I am. And it’s not that I’ve been hiding it on purpose.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers trembled as she stared at the screen, knowing she was standing on the edge of a cliff.</p><p>The phone buzzed again.</p><p>Rio: Look, I don’t care about anything other than getting to know you, okay? If you want to share something, I’m all ears. You can trust me. It’s okay.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, the weight of everything in her chest loosening just a little bit.</p><p>She took a deep breath, then typed out her response.</p><p>Agatha: Okay. Here’s the thing. My real name is Agatha Harkness.</p><p>There. It was out in the open. She didn’t know what would come of it, but it was time. The only question now was how Rio would react.</p><p>When Agatha hit send on her last message, she immediately regretted it. It had been a mix of relief and dread when she told Rio the truth, but now, seeing the text sit there on her screen, she started to feel the weight of it. Was she about to lose everything she’d been building with Rio?</p><p>The phone buzzed almost immediately.</p><p>Rio: Wait, wait, wait. Hold up... You’re actually Harkness? Like, THE Harkness</p><p>Agatha winced. She could practically hear Rio’s shock through the text, the disbelief practically leaping off the screen.</p><p>Agatha: Yeah. That’s me.</p><p>Another long pause.</p><p>Rio: Oh my god, no way, I just checked her, your? Instagram and that’s definitely Salem .. 🤣🤣 Wait, so all those jokes I made about you being a Harkness look-alike. Oh my god, you’ve been Harkness this whole time?!</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her stomach tightening as she waited for Rio’s next message. She could tell this was going in the opposite direction of what she’d hoped. Rio was embarrassed. Maybe even a little mortified. The playful tone had shifted from fun to something else—something more awkward.</p><p>Rio: I cannot believe this. You’ve been Harkness this whole time, and I’ve been joking about it, calling you look a like and all that crap... 🫣🫣🫣I feel like a total idiot right now.</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. She didn’t want Rio to feel bad, but she also didn’t know how to respond. She was just... Agatha. It was the whole reason she’d kept the secret.</p><p>Agatha: Hey, don’t worry about it. Honestly</p><p>Rio: No, you don’t get it. I’ve been making jokes about you being Harkness’ lookalike for days. I seriously thought I was just talking to someone who happened to look like her. I had no idea...</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. Rio was processing, and it was clear she was feeling the weight of her words. It was a lot to take in. Agatha knew that, so she decided to break the tension with a little humor.</p><p>Agatha: Well, you know... I do have a much better skincare routine at home. Maybe that’s what’s throwing you off.</p><p>Rio didn’t reply immediately, but a few seconds later, a message popped up.</p><p>Rio: Oh my god, I’m dying. I can’t believe I’ve been calling you Calderu. This is hilarious and mortifying all at the same time.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh. The embarrassment was palpable, but Rio was being genuine about it. And honestly, it was hard to stay mad—or even frustrated—when Rio was being so real with her.</p><p>Agatha: Hey, I get it. It’s funny, really. I just... didn’t want to make things weird with you. I didn’t know how to tell you.</p><p>Rio replied with a more thoughtful tone.</p><p>Rio: I just—wow. I can’t believe I’ve been making all those jokes about you being so similar to literally the person I’ve been texting. I mean, how did you keep it up this long?</p><p>Agatha laughed softly.</p><p>Agatha: It’s been a weird balancing act. I’m not really one for big announcements, especially when I just want to have a normal conversation with someone.</p><p>There was another pause, and Agatha could practically feel Rio’s wheels turning through the silence. Finally, Rio sent a message that wasn’t full of jokes but something more real, a little embarrassed but still kind.</p><p>Rio: I feel like such an idiot now. I can’t believe I’ve been calling you Harkness’ twin when you’ve literally been her the whole time. 🤣 But, seriously... I’m glad you told me. I’m just a little... mortified right now. 🫣</p><p>Agatha: Don’t be. Honestly, I’ve been laughing about it too. I just didn’t want you to think I was hiding it from you for any weird reason. I wasn’t sure how to bring it up. But now you know.</p><p>Rio: Well, I definitely wasn’t expecting this. I mean, you’re Harkness, but you’re also just Agatha, and you’re still cool as hell.</p><p>Agatha felt a little lighter with Rio’s words. Just Agatha. That felt like a step in the right direction.</p><p>Agatha: I’m still the same person. Same dog, same coffee addiction, same random jokes. I’m just a little more well-known than most people, that’s all.</p><p>Rio: I can handle that I think. Can we still hang out. Even if you are a famous pop star?</p><p>Agatha smiled to herself. It had taken a bit of awkwardness, but the conversation was finally settling back into something comfortable. Maybe it was embarrassing for both of them, but it was also... kind of refreshing. She wasn’t hiding anything anymore. Rio knew. And yet, she still wanted to hang out.</p><p>Agatha: Coffee sometime soon?</p><p>Rio: Honestly, it’s kind of hilarious now that I know you’re actually her. But yeah, coffee sounds perfect.</p><p>Agatha: It’s a date</p><p>The lightness in Agatha’s chest only grew as the messages continued, her nerves beginning to settle. This was new territory for both of them, but it didn’t feel like the end of something—it felt like the start of something that might be worth exploring. After all, Rio hadn’t just been joking around all this time; she had genuinely enjoyed talking to Agatha, even if she hadn’t known the truth.</p><p>And Agatha? She was starting to believe that, maybe, just maybe, this—whatever it was—could be real.</p><p>Agatha smiled at Rio’s last message, the tension easing as their conversation returned to a lighthearted rhythm. Then, just when she thought things couldn’t get any more awkward, Rio sent a new text that made Agatha pause for a second.</p><p>Rio: Wait. Why did your mom never tell me?😲 Like, seriously? You’ve been under her roof this whole time, and she didn’t say anything? How does that even happen?</p><p>Agatha blinked at the message, unsure of how to respond at first. She knew it was a fair question, but the truth was, Lilia had always kept her daughter’s identity as low-key as possible, especially when it came to her colleagues and friends.</p><p>Agatha: Honestly, I think it was a little deliberate. She’s always been super protective about me not being treated like a celebrity. She prefers people to just see me as me, not some famous person. She’s pretty good at keeping it under wraps.</p><p>Rio’s next message came through almost immediately.</p><p>Rio: I can’t believe that. You’d think she’d have mentioned it at least once. Like, ‘Hey, just so you know, Agatha’s actually a famous pop star.’ 😜 But I guess that makes sense. I mean, she never treated you like a big deal when we had dinner, so maybe it’s just part of the vibe.</p><p>Agatha chuckled at that, but the reality was, Rio was right. Lilia had always kept things low-key, even when Agatha had started gaining attention. The last thing her mom wanted was for Agatha to be seen through the lens of fame or for people to treat her differently.</p><p>Agatha: Yeah, shes my mom, to her I’m just me. When I first started getting attention, she basically made me promise I wouldn’t let it go to my head.</p><p>Rio: That’s crazy to me. I mean, I can’t even imagine being so low-key about being famous. But also, kinda cool.</p><p>Agatha smiled, appreciating that Rio wasn’t judging her for it. It felt strangely freeing to be able to explain all of this to someone without the usual pressure of needing to be “on” all the time.</p><p>Agatha: Yeah, I guess it’s a weird mix of wanting to keep things normal. I appreciate you being chill about it.</p><p>There was a brief pause before Rio texted back, and this time, her message was more thoughtful.</p><p>Rio: Well, it’s just... crazy to me that I’ve been talking to you like this without fully realizing who you were. And I can’t even believe Lilia never said anything. But I’m glad we’ve been able to talk like this, without all the celebrity stuff hanging over us.</p><p>Agatha’s heart warmed at Rio’s words. It was exactly how she’d been feeling—like they had something real, something that wasn’t built on her public persona or expectations. It made her think maybe Rio was different from the people who usually only saw the *Harkness* side of her.</p><p>Agatha: I feel the same way. Honestly, I just wanted to be Agatha with you. I didn’t want you to think I was some weird, untouchable person because of my career. It’s nice that we could just be ourselves</p><p>Rio: Exactly. But I’m really glad you told me. Even though I might’ve been an idiot with all those jokes, it’s nice to know the truth. I’m honestly kind of honored that you’d let me in on this part of your life.</p><p>Agatha smiled at the last part, feeling the weight of Rio’s sincerity. She wasn’t just trying to make light of the situation—she genuinely respected Agatha for telling her.</p><p>Agatha: Well, I’m glad you’re not weirded out or anything. I know it’s a lot to take in, and I didn’t want to make it awkward.</p><p>Rio: I mean, I’ll admit it’s a little wild, but honestly, I think it’s pretty cool. And don’t worry, I’m not weirded out. I will be laughing at myself for thinking you were just some look-alike, but that’s on me, right?</p><p>Agatha laughed, the tension completely gone now. It was nice to see that Rio was able to laugh at herself, too. And the idea that Rio wasn’t treating her any differently was more than Agatha could’ve hoped for.</p><p>Agatha: It’s all good. I’m just glad you’re still down to hang out. Famous or not.</p><p>Rio’s reply came quickly.</p><p>Rio: Of course! I mean, I’ve been hanging out with you as a normal person this whole time. I’m not going to stop now just because you’re actually secretly famous.</p><p>Agatha smiled, feeling the warmth spread through her chest. Rio wasn’t phased. She wasn’t backing off now that she knew the truth. She was treating Agatha just like before. That was something Agatha hadn’t expected, but it felt right</p><p>Agatha: Good to know 😊So... coffee tomorrow? I think I owe you a proper apology for letting you dig your hole</p><p>Rio: Oh, don’t worry about that. Just promise me no more surprises about you</p><p>Agatha: No promises, but I’ll try</p><p>Rio: Deal 🥰</p><p>Agatha felt a surge of relief as she set the phone down. Despite the initial awkwardness of the whole thing, it seemed like they were both still on the same page. And for the first time in a long while, Agatha didn’t feel like her fame was a wall between her and someone else. With Rio, it felt like there was still room to be just Agatha.</p><p>The next day, Agatha found herself getting ready for a coffee date with Rio—a real one this time, without any pretense, no look a like jokes or awkward moments looming over them. She could feel her nerves fluttering, but they were different this time. It wasn’t the usual anxiety of meeting someone new; it was something else—an excitement, maybe? Agatha wasn’t quite sure, but she was ready for it.</p><p>Salem sat by the door, tail wagging eagerly as Agatha grabbed her leash.</p><p>“You’re coming with me today, Saley ,” she said, smiling at her dog, who looked absolutely thrilled at the prospect of a walk.</p><p>When Rio arrived at her drive, Agatha was already waiting, Salem at her side, wearing a casual but comfortable outfit similar to the first day they met—shorts, a hoodie, and her braids. She felt... normal. At ease. No cameras, no makeup, no expectations.</p><p>Rio pulled up, her car slowing to a stop, and she grinned at Agatha as she stepped out.</p><p>“You look ready for a coffee date,” Rio teased, giving Agatha a quick once-over. She was dressed casually too—jeans, a simple tee, and sneakers, with her hair pulled back in a messy bun. She looked good.</p><p>“Salem is ready for it too,” Agatha teased back, reaching down to give Salem’s head a quick pat.</p><p>Rio’s eyes lit up as she saw Salem. “Oh, she’s actually coming with us?”</p><p>“If that’s okay. She wants to be part of the fun,” Agatha said, attaching Salem’s leash to her collar.</p><p>“Fair enough. Can’t go without the dog of the hour,” Rio laughed, stepping aside to let Agatha into the car.</p><p>The drive to the coffee shop was lighthearted, filled with easy conversation. Rio kept up with her usual banter, asking Agatha about her time at home and how she was adjusting to life off the press circuit. Salem, meanwhile, was content to curl up in the back seat, occasionally peering up at Rio with those big, soulful eyes.</p><p>When they arrived at the coffee shop, they took a spot at the outdoor seating area, perfect for Salem to stretch out and enjoy the fresh air. They found a table near the edge of the patio, and Agatha was pleased to see that the shop wasn’t too crowded—just a few people enjoying their drinks and soaking in the morning sun.</p><p>Agatha placed her order for a cold brew and a pastry, while Rio got a cappuccino again. When the drinks arrived, they sat back in their chairs, the conversation flowing easily between them as they chatted about everything and nothing.</p><p>“So, are you still planning on going to the studio later?” Rio asked, a playful glint in her eyes. “Or are you just gonna slack off for the day?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, shaking her head. “I’m always working, Rio.” She took a sip of her coffee, then added, “Actually, I was planning to head there after this, but I wouldn’t mind having some company. It’s a bit of a small studio, but I’ve been working on some new tracks. It’s kind of my second home while I’m home honestly.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. “A studio, huh? You’re gonna have to show me that sometime. Maybe I’ll learn a thing or two.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “If you don’t mind hanging out and wearing headphones, sure. It’s not as glamorous as you might think. But it’s where I get all my best work done.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m down. I love seeing how people do their thing. Especially when it’s my favourite artist” Rio said with a wink.</p><p>Agatha smiled. There was something about Rio that made her feel comfortable. It wasn’t just the humor or the lack of pretense—it was the way Rio seemed genuinely interested in everything Agatha did, without any pressure or expectations.</p><p>“You can come along then if you want,” Agatha teased. “But I can’t promise you’ll witness anything profound while I’m slaving away on guitar riffs.”</p><p>“I’ll try not to be too distracting,” Rio grinned. “But I’m definitely curious about your creative process. So when are you going back out on the road, anyway?”</p><p>Agatha sighed softly, the weight of the question suddenly hitting her. “In less than two weeks,” she said, stirring her coffee absentmindedly. “I’ve been trying to enjoy being at home while I can. It’s hard, you know? It feels like I just get settled, and then it’s time to leave again.”</p><p>“I can’t even imagine,” Rio said, her tone more serious now. “But at least you get to do what you love, right? I’m sure the crowds love having you around.”</p><p>Agatha smiled but gave a small shrug. “Yeah, I guess so. It’s just... it’s a lot sometimes. I’m looking forward to the tour, but I’ll miss this - just hanging out without anyone expecting anything from me, you know?”</p><p>Rio nodded, and for a second, they sat in a comfortable silence, the sounds of the coffee shop and the distant chatter of other customers filling the air.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio finally said, breaking the quiet. “I totally get that. I mean, I’m nothing like you,  but sometimes it’s nice to just not have to be switched on. You know?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, relieved. She didn’t have to explain herself more than that. Rio understood.</p><p>“You should definitely come by the studio today,” Agatha added after a moment, pushing herself up from the table. “I’ll head there in a bit. We can go together, if you’re still up for it.”</p><p>Rio stood, “Definitely. I’m curious to see the magic happen.”</p><p>As they walked back to the car, Salem trotting happily beside them, Agatha realized how natural everything felt. No surprises, no pretenses—just two people enjoying each other’s company. And even with the looming pressure of the tour, she found herself wanting to savor these moments with Rio. The clock was ticking, and soon she would be back on the road, but for now, it was nice to just be in the moment.</p><p>When they reached the studio, Agatha led Rio inside, showing her around the space where she had spent countless hours over the years. She could almost feel the creative energy in the air, the memories of songs written and melodies crafted.</p><p>“This is it,” Agatha said with a grin. “Nothing too fancy, but it’s home.”</p><p>Rio looked around, her eyes wide with appreciation. “I love it,” she said, stepping further into the space. “It’s... it’s perfect.”</p><p>Agatha felt a flicker of hope—maybe, just maybe, this was the beginning of something real, even if her time at home was quickly running out.</p>

<p>As Agatha watched Rio wonder around the studio, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, seeing Alice’s name flashing on the screen.</p><p>"For god sake," Agatha muttered, tapping the screen to answer. She quickly raised the phone to her ear, her voice slightly teasing. "Hey, Alice. You miss me yet?"</p><p>Alice's voice came through loud and clear, filled with her usual enthusiasm. “Of course, I miss you. How's it going? Are you making music or just hanging out with Salem and your mom, being a hermit?”</p><p>“Well, a bit of both, actually,” Agatha replied, keeping the tone light. “But I have a visitor at the studio today.”</p><p>Alice’s curiosity piqued instantly. “Ooh, a visitor? Someone I know?”</p><p>Agatha glanced over at Rio, who was quietly observing the sound equipment near the back wall, clearly impressed by the setup. She smiled before answering, trying to keep things casual. “Yeah, someone I’ve told you about … Rio.”</p><p>“Rio?” Alice repeated, drawing out the name with surprise. “Wait, Rio as in the Rio you’ve been texting nonstop?”</p><p>Agatha froze for a moment, her cheeks going slightly red. “I wouldn’t say nonstop, but yeah, that Rio.”</p><p>Rio, having overheard her name, turned and gave a small, inquisitive smile, as if waiting for Agatha to explain.</p><p>“It’s Alice,” Agatha said, holding the phone up and putting it on speaker. “She’s my best friend and guitarist. Alice, this is Rio.”</p><p>Alice’s voice instantly shifted to an overly enthusiastic tone. “Oh, the Rio? I’ve heard so much about you,” Alice said, practically squealing through the phone. “Agatha hasn’t stopped talking about you, just so you know. It’s pretty much all she’s said for the past couple of days, actually.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened in horror, her face going completely red. “Alice! Shut the fuck up,” she hissed, trying to hide her embarrassment.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly amused but also slightly surprised. She glanced at Agatha, who looked like she might combust from mortification. “Oh? Really? Well, I guess I’m flattered.” She shot Agatha a playful grin before adding to Alice, “But now I’m very curious about all the things she’s been saying.”</p><p>Agatha buried her face in her hands, trying to hide the ridiculous smile forming despite her embarrassment. “I swear I didn’t say that much,” she muttered under her breath. “You’re killing me, Alice.”</p><p>Alice, of course, didn’t stop there. “No, seriously. She’s been like a walking advertisement for you, Rio. ‘Rio this,’ ‘Rio that.’ It’s adorable,” she teased, her voice absolutely bursting with amusement. “I mean, honestly, I thought she was going to implode when you first showed up at her house. But now it’s, like, full-blown crush mode.”</p><p>Agatha cringed. She could feel the heat of her embarrassment radiating. “Oh my god, Alice. Shut. The. Fuck. Up.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened, a smirk playing on her lips as she laughed. “So, Agatha.What else have you been saying about me? You’ve got me really curious now.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, slouching in a chair by the control desk. “I should’ve known Alice would be like this,” she muttered. “Just, you know, that you’re cool and fun to hang out with.”</p><p>Alice’s voice came through again, teasing but sincere. “It’s just funny how you went from, like, ‘yeah, whatever, just some colleague of Mom’s’ to ‘OMG, Rio’s so amazing, I can’t wait to see her again. Super subtle, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, burying her face in her hands. “Okay, really dying now. Thanks a lot, Alice. You’ve just made everything incredibly awkward.”</p><p>Rio chuckled at Agatha’s clear discomfort. It was easy to see that Agatha wasn’t great at being vulnerable in situations like this, but Rio wasn’t exactly mad about it. In fact, it made her want to get to know Agatha even more.</p><p>“I can’t believe it, Agatha,” Rio said with a playful grin, looking at her. “I mean, I’ve been hanging out with someone who acts so chill”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, finally lifting her head from her hands. “Well, someone has to balance out your constant chatter. I’m the chill one, okay?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly amused. “Chill, huh? You sure about that?”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, Alice chimed in again, her voice holding a little more curiosity this time. “So, Rio, what do you think of my best friend? Is this a whole new side to her you didn’t expect?”</p><p>Rio laughed, taking a second to really think about it. “Honestly, yeah. I wasn’t sure what to expect after hearing she’s harkness —maybe I thought she’d be more... well, you know, chaotic or distant? But she’s nothing like what I imagined. I mean, she’s way more down-to-earth than I thought she’d be.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a playful look, trying to hide a smile. “See? You thought I was a diva. I’m so offended.”</p><p>Rio grinned back at her. “I mean, you’ve got the cool factor down, but you’re not as chaotic as I imagined.”</p><p>“Well, I try to keep the drama in my personal life to a minimum,” Agatha replied with a dry laugh. “But, thanks for not running for the hills after you found out who I am. I mean, I kind of thought you’d freak.”</p><p>Rio looked at her with a mixture of curiosity and something deeper, something she wasn’t quite ready to put into words yet. “Honestly, I wasn’t sure what to expect when I found out. But I’m still figuring out the real Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha paused, her heart fluttering a little. That was exactly how she wanted it—no layers of fame, no expectations. Just her.</p><p>“Well, lucky for you, Rio,” Agatha said softly, her eyes meeting Rio’s, “I’m a lot easier to figure out than I seem.”</p><p>Alice’s voice broke the moment with a loud, teasing shout from the phone. “If you two don’t stop being all cute, I’m gonna lose it.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and laughed. “I’m hanging up on you, Alice,” she said, smiling at Rio. “Sorry about that. She’s just extra.”</p><p>“No worries,” Rio said with a grin, clearly unbothered. “But, uh, you know... now I’m really curious. When’s the next time we can hang out?”</p><p>Agatha paused, smiling back. “How about tomorrow? Maybe just at my house?”</p><p>Rio laughed, leaning back in her chair. “I’m good with that. I’ll take whatever I can get.”</p><p>As Agatha ended the call with Alice, she couldn’t help but smile. This was exactly what she needed—someone who saw her for who she was, not just the face plastered on every billboard or album cover. Rio might’ve been a little confused at first, but she was still acting the same around her. And for the first time in a long time, Agatha wasn’t worried about what tomorrow would bring.</p><p>The studio was quiet once Rio left, the only sound coming from the hum of the speakers and the soft tapping of Agatha’s fingers against her keyboard. She sat on the edge of the desk, Salem curled up at her feet, as she picked up her phone and scrolled through her Instagram feed.</p><p>Agatha found herself wanting to share something with her followers. It had been a while since she posted anything from the studio. She had snapped a quick picture of her workspace earlier, a cluttered desk, an acoustic guitar leaning against the wall, the sunlight coming through the windows and casting soft shadows over everything.</p><p>In the corner of the picture, though, unnoticed by Agatha, a reflection in the studio mirror. Rio’s profile was visible, her face just out of frame but unmistakably a female form. She had been standing over by the soundboard, fiddling with the settings while Agatha worked.</p><p>Without thinking too much about it, Agatha tapped *Post*. She didn’t intend for it to be a big deal—just another glimpse into her creative process. The caption was simple: Creative day today 🎧 🎵</p><p>She set the phone down and returned to her work, her mind drifting to her and Rios talk. It had been nice—no pressure, just two people enjoying each other's company. Agatha smiled to herself, pushing her thoughts back to the music.</p><p>But by the time she looked back at her phone, her notifications were blowing up.</p><p>Her phone was vibrating nonstop, and when she pulled it up, her screen was filled with comments.</p><p>@Eliott_23: Love the vibe of this! And the puppy!! 😍</p><p>@sarah.reed12: Wait... who is that in the mirror??? Muse!?!</p><p>Agatha stared at the screen in disbelief, her stomach doing a flip. She hadn’t even realized Rio was in the reflection but it was clear now that her fans had noticed. There was no hiding it.</p><p>Agatha sighed and leaned back in her chair, running a hand through her hair. It was a harmless shot, right? But the fact that she didn’t realize Rio had been caught in the reflection like that—well, now it felt like she’d unintentionally made a statement. She didn’t mind it, but the attention was something else.</p><p>Her phone buzzed again, and she nearly jumped when she saw the name.</p><p>Rio: Seriously? I’m in your pic? You couldn’t even warn me I was accidentally going to be all in your insta comments</p><p>Agatha smiled, trying to keep her composure. She quickly typed back.</p><p>Agatha: I swear I didn’t even realize until my phone blew up with notifications. My bad.</p><p>Rio: So I’m your mysterious muse now, huh? Gonna have to work on my model pose for next time.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, feeling her cheeks warm slightly.</p><p>Agatha: You look great, don’t worry.</p><p>Rio: Well, I guess now I’m secretly famous too</p><p>Agatha laughed, leaning back in her chair and looking over at the mirror where Rio’s profile had been. She couldn’t believe her reflection had caused so much of a stir. The comments kept rolling in.</p><p>@Harknessmama: You have a secret muse Harkness? Something you want to share with the class 👀👀</p><p>Agatha felt her phone buzz again, and this time, it was a message from Alice. She hesitated, then opened it, bracing herself for whatever ridiculousness Alice was about to send.</p><p>Alice: So I guess Rio’s really part of the team now, huh?</p><p>Agatha: Shut up, Alice. It was an accident.</p><p>Alice: An accident, Really? That picture is literally calling out to the universe. You and Rio now, huh?</p><p>Agatha: No, it’s not like that at all. She was just there while I took the pic</p><p>Alice: Uh-huh. Whatever you say</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t stop the grin tugging at her lips. Alice’s teasing was not new to her.</p><p>She typed a quick reply.</p><p>Agatha: You’re a dick. Fuck off</p><p>As she set her phone down, the reality of the situation hit her again. This wasn’t just a small post anymore. The fans were paying attention. More than that, they were eager to find out who Rio was. And that left Agatha with one thought.</p><p>She really had to figure out what this was between her and Rio before it got any more complicated.</p><p>With less than two weeks left at home, she wasn’t sure where things would go—but for now, she couldn’t help but feel a little excited about the possibilities.</p><p>The week flew by, the hang out at her house had gone well and before Agatha knew it, the weekend had arrived. The steady hum of her studio sessions, her songwriting, and the looming countdown to her tour left her feeling like time was slipping through her fingers. Still, she couldn’t ignore the pull she felt every time her phone buzzed with a message from Rio. She found herself looking forward to their conversations more than she cared to admit, even if it felt like she was slowly losing control of whatever this was between them.</p><p>Saturday afternoon came, and Agatha was putting the finishing touches on a new track when her phone pinged. She glanced at the screen, surprised to see a message from Rio—something a little different from the usual banter.</p><p>Rio: Hey. I was thinking... how about I take you out to dinner tonight? Like, a proper date. No puppy play dates or studio mirrors involved this time. What do you say?</p><p>Agatha stared at the message for a few moments, her fingers hovering above the screen. Was this actually happening? Was Rio seriously asking her out? It felt surreal, but the way Rio worded it made it clear it wasn’t just a casual hangout anymore. This was a date - date.</p><p>Her heart beat a little faster, a nervous excitement stirring in her chest. She’d had a lot of people close to her tell her she should take more time for herself—especially when it came to relationships—but this was Rio. The easy, charming Rio. The one who’d made her laugh, who’d picked up on every little thing about her without even trying. Who seemed to care just a little more than most people did.</p><p>She quickly typed back.</p><p>Agatha: I’m not gonna lie, I’ve been waiting for you to ask me out properly. Dinner sounds great. Where are we going?*</p><p>The reply came almost immediately.</p><p>Rio: I know this cozy little Italian place by the park. I’ve been dying to take you there. 7pm work for you?</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding.</p><p>Agatha: Perfect. I’ll be ready.</p><p>After she hit send, she set her phone down, leaning back in her chair and letting herself absorb what had just happened. A proper date.</p><p>The nerves hit her almost immediately after. What was she supposed to wear? How was she supposed to act? It wasn’t like she had a ton of experience with this sort of thing—Agatha didn’t usually date in the traditional sense. She’d been busy with her music, and when she wasn’t, she was running away from the very idea of getting involved with someone. But this was different. This was Rio. And despite her best attempts to stay casual, a part of her was excited. Nervous. Giddy, even.</p><p>She shook her head, trying to clear the swirl of thoughts.</p><p>“Okay, calm down,” she muttered to herself.</p><p>With a quick glance at the clock, she realised she had a little over an hour to get ready. The tension in her chest wouldn’t quite dissipate, but she made her way upstairs to find something to wear anyway.</p><p>By 6:30, she was dressed in a simple black dress that fell just above her knees, paired with a black leather jacket to keep things casual, but still nice. She opted for minimal makeup, wanting to keep things natural—no need for anything too dramatic. A quick spritz of perfume, and she was done.</p><p>She glanced at the mirror one last time, fluffing her natural curls as much as she could, before grabbing her phone to check the time.</p><p>7:00 pm sharp.</p><p>A text from Rio came through right as she was heading downstairs.</p><p>Rio: On my way to pick you up.</p><p>Agatha smiled to herself, trying to keep her composure. She was ready.</p><p>When the doorbell rang, her heart skipped a beat. She took a deep breath, opening the door to find Rio standing there, looking effortlessly stunning in a light jacket and dark jeans. Her dark hair was down and  tousled, and her smile was warm and genuine.</p><p>“You look amazing,” Rio said with a smile, her eyes lighting up as she took Agatha in.</p><p>Agatha laughed nervously, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. “You too. I guess we both cleaned up okay.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, and Agatha felt her nerves settle a little.</p><p>“Shall we?” Rio asked, offering her arm.</p><p>“Lead the way,” Agatha replied, her heart racing just a little faster than it probably should.</p><p>They made their way to Rio’s car, chatting casually as they went. The drive was smooth, and Agatha found herself laughing at some of the funny stories Rio shared. They were easy together, slipping back into the comfortable rhythm they’d had since  they’d first met.</p><p>When they arrived at the restaurant, a cozy little Italian spot tucked away near the park, Rio parked the car and turned to Agatha.</p><p>“I hope this is okay,” Rio said, her tone a little more serious now. “I know it’s not the fanciest place or probably what your used to, but it’s my favorite. I thought we’d keep it low-key.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. “It’s perfect,” she said, meaning it. “I’m glad you picked somewhere that actually means something to you.”</p><p>Rio seemed to relax a little at that, and they walked into the restaurant together, the soft light of the place making everything feel warm and intimate. They were seated by the window, and the conversation flowed as easily.</p><p>It wasn’t like anything Agatha had experienced before. This wasn’t just a fun hangout or a casual chat. It was different. And she couldn’t help but feel like it was the beginning of something real.</p><p>As the evening wore on, Agatha found herself getting lost in Rio’s eyes, in her laughter, in the way she talked about her life, her work, even the lengthy spiel about azaleas. For the first time in a long time while in a public setting, she wasn’t thinking about the tour or her public persona. She wasn’t Harkness. She was just Agatha.</p><p>And with Rio, that felt like more than enough.</p><p>The evening was everything Agatha didn’t realise she’d been craving. The cozy Italian restaurant had an intimate atmosphere—dim lights, soft jazz playing in the background, and the rich scent of garlic and fresh basil in the air. It felt like a little slice of normalcy in a world where everything was often too loud and too bright.</p><p>The food was incredible. Agatha had opted for a classic spaghetti carbonara, and with the first bite, she couldn’t help but let out an exaggerated sigh of contentment.</p><p>“Oh my god,” she murmured, her eyes practically rolling back in delight. “This is amazing.”</p><p>Rio smiled, clearly pleased. “I told you. I wasn’t kidding when I said it was the best.”</p><p>“I might have to come back here every night before I leave,” Agatha said between bites, savoring the rich sauce. “Like, forget the tour. This is my new life.”</p><p>They locked eyes, and for a moment, the teasing banter between them softened. The playful tension was still there, but it was layered with something deeper. Something Agatha wasn’t ready to label.</p><p>The conversation drifted to music, the band, and Rio’s work as a professor. Agatha loved hearing about Rio’s projects, the things she was passionate about, and the way she described her students and her colleagues. It made her feel even more drawn to Rio—like there was so much more to her than the casual, charming person she had initially met.</p><p>At one point, Rio leaned forward, her eyes locked on Agatha’s. “So, you’ve been really quiet tonight. No sarcastic remarks or witty comebacks. What’s going on?” she teased, her smile playful.</p><p>Agatha laughed, catching her breath. “I’m just… enjoying the night. And honestly, I’m having a great time.”</p><p>“Me too,” Rio said, her voice soft but steady. “I don’t think I’ve had a date like this in a long time. No pressure, just talking. Eating. It’s nice.”</p><p>Agatha felt a flutter in her chest. There was something in Rio’s tone that made her want to stay in this moment, to keep the connection between them simple and real.</p><p>But as they chatted, the inevitable happened. The door to the restaurant opened with a jingle of the bell, and a couple of young women walked in, glancing over toward Agatha’s table. The air seemed to shift just slightly, and Rio noticed it first. They didn’t stare, but they were looking, talking quietly between themselves, trying to decide whether or not to approach.</p><p>After a few seconds, one of the women stood up and walked over, her eyes wide with recognition.</p><p>“I’m sorry to interrupt, but I’m your biggest fan?” she said hesitantly, her voice a little unsure.</p><p>Agatha froze for a moment, surprised at how quickly the shift happened, but she masked it with a friendly smile. Rio, sitting across from her, immediately straightened, clearly uncomfortable with the sudden attention. She didn’t quite know how to navigate it—whether to stay quiet, to keep a low profile, or to play it cool.</p><p>Agatha turned to the woman with a smile, still gracious as always. “Thank you.” She paused, glancing at Rio briefly before looking back at the fan. “Is there something I can help you with?”</p><p>The woman’s face lit up, and she pulled out her phone, already holding it out expectantly. “Could we get a selfie? My friend is going to freak out when she hears I met you!”</p><p>Agatha hesitated for just a second, but the fake smile never faltered. “Of course,” she said, moving her chair back slightly. “But just a quick one, alright?”</p><p>The woman quickly snapped a selfie with Agatha, both of them smiling for the camera. As they finished, another voice interrupted from a nearby table.</p><p>“Is that Harkness?”</p><p>A second wave of fans had started to approach, and Agatha sighed inwardly. She wasn’t angry - she loved her fans, always had—but the situation made her feel awkward, especially now that Rio was sitting right there. Agatha had worked hard to keep her life as low-key as possible, at least when she was at home, but it was moments like these that reminded her how easily her world could shift back into the public eye.</p><p>Rio’s unease was evident. She smiled politely at the fans, but Agatha could see the discomfort in her eyes. Rio wasn’t used to this. She wasn’t used to the public attention that came with dating someone in Agatha’s position.</p><p>Agatha stood, still smiling at the fans, signing a couple of quick autographs and taking a couple more pictures before she could gracefully excuse herself. “Alright, that’s all for tonight,” she said, keeping her tone upbeat. “I’m on a very important dinner date.”</p><p>There was a murmur of understanding, and Agatha could feel the fans slowly backing away. She returned to her seat, trying not to feel the weight of their stares.</p><p>When she sat back down, Rio was fiddling with her glass, her eyes darting toward the window. She looked a little rattled, but Agatha caught her gaze and gave her a soft smile.</p><p>“Hey, I’m really sorry about that,” Agatha said, a little sheepish. “I should’ve warned you it might happen, I get it if you want to leave.”</p><p>Rio nodded, but she was still processing. “It’s not that,” she said, her voice soft but honest. “It’s just... I don’t know how to act in situations like that. It’s like a different world, you know? And I don’t know if I’m ready for that kind of attention.”</p><p>Agatha reached across the table, her fingers brushing against Rio’s. “You don’t have to be ready for it,” she said, her voice low and reassuring. “I’m used to it. But you don’t have to be if you dont want to be.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, her eyes softening. “I know. I just didn’t want to mess anything up.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, squeezing her hand. “You’re doing just fine. Trust me.”</p><p>They fell into a comfortable silence, the moment of tension already fading, replaced by the soft hum of the restaurant’s atmosphere. Agatha realised something as she sat there, looking at Rio across the table: this wasn’t just a fleeting attraction or a passing fling.</p><p>Whatever this was, it was growing, and Agatha found herself more and more eager to see where it could go.</p><p>The drive back was quiet, but not in an uncomfortable way. There was a kind of peacefulness between them, the kind that only came after a night that felt like it had been built on real connection. The tension from earlier had melted away, and Agatha felt herself leaning back into the seat, content.</p><p>Rio didn’t seem to want to break the silence either, though every now and then she would glance at Agatha, a soft smile on her lips. She wasn’t nervous anymore. Just present.</p><p>As they neared Agatha’s house, the warm glow of the windows felt like a beacon welcoming her back to reality, but the night was far from over in either of their minds. Rio pulled up to the drive, parking the car and turning off the engine.</p><p>“Well,” Rio said, glancing at Agatha, her smile playful. “This is your stop. I guess I’ll have to go home now.”</p><p>Agatha let out a small laugh, though it was slightly laced with reluctance. “Yeah, I guess so.” She hesitated, not ready for the night to end.</p><p>There was a moment where neither of them moved, where both were caught between the pull of the evening and the knowledge that it was winding down. Agatha wasn’t sure if it was the quiet hum of the night or the fact that her heart was still racing from the way Rio had looked at her all night, but she felt an urge to say something more.</p><p>“I really had a great time tonight,” Agatha said softly, her eyes meeting Rio’s. “You’ve definitely made my last full weekend at home something to remember.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened, and she leaned in slightly, her gaze dipping to Agatha’s lips for a fraction of a second before meeting her eyes again. “I’m glad. I’d like to do it again sometime.”</p><p>And just like that, the air between them shifted. The words hung there, unspoken but understood.</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat, her pulse picking up speed. There was something about the way Rio was looking at her, something undeniable that made Agatha’s breath hitch. She wasn’t sure who made the first move, but before she could overthink it, Rio’s lips were on hers.</p><p>The kiss was gentle at first—almost tentative—like they were both still feeling the edges of this new connection. But then Agatha responded, leaning into it, her hand brushing the side of Rio’s neck as the kiss deepened. Fireworks. That’s the only way Agatha could describe it—like something igniting deep inside her. It wasn’t just the spark of attraction, but the rush of something else. She felt it in her chest, in her fingers, in her entire body.</p><p>When they finally pulled apart, both were breathless. Agatha’s eyes fluttered open, her mind a little foggy from the intensity of it all. Rio was looking at her with wide, almost disbelieving eyes, as if she, too, was trying to wrap her head around what had just happened.</p><p>“Wow,” Rio breathed, her voice quiet, but full of awe. “I did not expect that.”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly, still slightly dazed from the kiss. “Yeah,” she murmured, her thumb gently brushing her lower lip. “Me neither.”</p><p>Rio’s smile was warm, a little shy, but unmistakably pleased. She paused for a moment, and Agatha could see her gathering her thoughts.</p><p>“So…” Rio started, glancing at Agatha, her eyes sparkling with that same playful energy from earlier. “Since we’re on the same page now, how about another date in a few days? I promise, no more public interruptions. Just us.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but smile, feeling her heart flutter at the thought of seeing Rio again. It’s not just the kiss, she realised. It’s her.</p><p>“I’d like that,” Agatha replied, her voice steady, though her smile gave away her excitement.</p><p>Rio grinned, her eyes softening. “Good. I’ll plan something special. Just you wait.”</p><p>They shared another brief, lingering look, and for a moment, neither of them moved—just enjoying the quiet, comfortable energy that hung between them.</p><p>“Well,” Agatha said with a playful sigh, breaking the silence. “I guess I should go inside before Salem starts worrying about me.”</p><p>“Ah, yes. Can’t have Salem getting mad at me,” Rio teased. “I’ll let you go, then.”</p><p>Agatha opened the door, hesitating for a moment before turning back to Rio. “I’ll see you soon,” she said, her voice warm, her heart still beating a little faster as she leaned forward for a final kiss.</p><p>Rio smiled and nodded. “You definitely will.”</p><p>As Agatha stepped out of the car, she looked back one last time, watching as Rio pulled away and disappeared into the night. Agatha stood there for a moment, the soft breeze brushing against her skin, trying to process everything that had just happened.</p><p>This is real, she thought, a smile tugging at her lips. This is really happening.</p><p>And as she walked back inside, her heart felt a little lighter. There was still so much left to figure out with Rio, with herself, and with the life she was about to return to on tour—but for tonight, she didn’t need any of those answers.</p><p>For tonight, all that mattered was the kiss, the connection, and the promise of something more.</p>

<p>The next morning, Agatha sat at the kitchen table, absently stirring her coffee, her mind still buzzing from the night before. The kiss, the energy, the feeling of wanting to see Rio again—it all replayed in her head, every moment making her heart race.</p><p>Her mom had just finished getting ready for the day and was making her way into the kitchen when she caught Agatha’s faraway look.</p><p>“You look like you’ve been hit with a freight train,” Lilia teased gently, pouring herself a cup of tea. “What’s going on? Spill.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a small smile, but she still didn’t look up right away. “It’s Rio,” she said, the words slipping out with a weight she hadn’t expected. “We went out last night… and we kissed.”</p><p>Lilias voice softened, the tone shifting to something more thoughtful. "It sounds like you’re really starting to care about her."</p><p>Agatha paused, the weight of her mom’s words settling in. She had spent so long avoiding connections, afraid of anything that might pull her away from the independence she’d worked so hard to cultivate. But now, with Rio, it felt like something was happening, something she didn’t want to ignore.</p><p>“I think I might be,” she admitted, her voice quieter than usual. "I’ve been so used to keeping people at arm's length, but with Rio… I feel like I can be myself. It's like she just gets me."</p><p>"That’s a good sign," Lilia said. "What’s different about Rio?"</p><p>Agatha thought for a moment. There had been others—those fleeting, surface-level connections that hadn’t come close to matching the depth she felt now. "I think it’s because Rio isn’t trying to be anything other than herself," she said, her voice gaining strength. "She’s not intimidated by my life, and she doesn’t want to change me. And I can see how she reacts to the public stuff, to the attention. It’s different. She’s still figuring it out, but there’s something really real about her. And honestly, I admire that about her."</p><p>Lilia paused before responding, as if weighing her words carefully. "You’ve always gone after what you wanted, but you’ve never been someone who settled. I think Rios special. Just be sure you’re taking it slow, okay? Don’t rush into anything, no matter how strong the pull is."</p><p>Agatha nodded, "I’m trying to. I just... I don’t want to mess it up, you know? I’ve spent so long not letting anyone in, and now that I feel this connection, I don’t want to lose it."</p><p>"You won’t lose it if it’s meant to be, sweetie," Lilia reassured her. "And don’t be afraid of letting it happen. Love isn’t always about timing or perfection; it’s about being with someone who accepts you, all of you, and still wants to be there."</p><p>A small smile tugged at Agatha’s lips. "I think Rio might be that person. It’s just... all so new. I’m still trying to figure out what I want from all of this."</p><p>Her mom chuckled. "Well, take your time. You don’t have to have all the answers right away. Just enjoy getting to know her, and let things unfold naturally."</p><p>Agatha leaned back, feeling a sense of calm wash over her. "Thanks, Mom. I’ll keep that in mind."</p><p>"Anytime, sweetheart," Lilia said warmly.</p><p>Agatha smiled, her heart light. "I love you mom."</p><p>She was still figuring out what this all meant—what her connection with Rio would ultimately look like—but for now, it felt right. And that was enough.</p><p>With a content sigh, she stood up, letting Salem hop off her lap as she walked toward the window, glancing out at the sunny morning as Lilia left for work. She had no idea what the future held, but for the first time in a long while, she was excited to find out.</p><p>A few days later, Agatha found herself standing in front of the mirror, adjusting her shirt one last time. She’d been looking forward to tonight—another date with Rio, after the whirlwind of the last one. Agatha had to admit, the kiss had stayed with her. It lingered in the back of her mind, a constant reminder of something genuine. And tonight, Rio had planned something different—a private date, just the two of them, away from the prying eyes of the public.</p><p>She grabbed a light jacket, knowing it might get cool as the evening wore on, and slipped her phone into her pocket. She was nervous, but not in the way she had been before. It wasn’t the uncertainty of whether things would go well, but the excitement of something new, something intimate.</p><p>As she made her way downstairs, the sound of a car pulling up outside caught her attention. She walked toward the door, her heart picking up speed, and opened it to find Rio waiting at the car door, leaning against the car with a soft smile on her face. Rio had changed her look a little—casual, but still effortlessly stylish. She wore a pair of jeans and a cozy sweater, her hair half up and half down.</p><p>"Hey," Agatha greeted, a soft smile tugging at her lips. "You look great."</p><p>Rio’s grin widened. "You’re not so bad yourself."</p><p>Agatha felt her cheeks warm slightly, but she pushed it aside as Rio opened the passenger door for her. Agatha slipped into the seat, and Rio got in behind the wheel. The car hummed to life, and they began the drive toward the location Rio had chosen.</p><p>"Where are we going, exactly?" Agatha asked, leaning back in the seat and trying to get a sense of where they were headed.</p><p>"It’s a surprise," Rio teased, glancing over at her with a playful glint in her eyes. "But I promise, no fans. No paparazzi. Just us."</p><p>Agatha chuckled, feeling the relief settle in her chest. "That sounds perfect."</p><p>The drive was peaceful, and soon they found themselves pulling up to a quiet, secluded spot on the outskirts of town. A small hill overlooking a wide, serene lake, the kind of place that felt untouched and private. Rio parked the car and got out, opening the trunk to reveal a picnic basket and a blanket. Agatha couldn’t help the smile that spread across her face. Rio had clearly put thought into this.</p><p>"Come on," Rio said, her voice warm as she began spreading the blanket on the soft grass. "I thought we could enjoy dinner with a view."</p><p>Agatha walked over and sat down, feeling the cool breeze on her skin as she looked out at the lake, the sky painted in shades of pink and orange as the sun began its descent. The scene was breathtaking—quiet and private, just like Rio had promised. It felt like the perfect escape from the world.</p><p>"You really thought of everything, didn’t you?" Agatha said, her voice full of admiration as she settled down beside Rio.</p><p>Rio gave a modest shrug, but there was a flicker of pride in her eyes. "I thought it might be nice to just focus on us."</p><p>Agatha’s heart warmed at the thought, her chest tightening with appreciation. "I love that," she said quietly.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, her smile warm as she handed Agatha the basket. “Ready for a sunset picnic?”</p><p>Agatha smiled back, taking the basket from her. “I’ve never had a sunset picnic before. Sounds perfect.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, her eyes sparkling. “I figured you could use a break from all the noise. I thought we’d find a spot where it’s just us.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, feeling a sense of relief settle in her chest. It was exactly what she needed—a chance to enjoy Rio’s company without the distractions.</p><p>It wasn’t an elaborate meal, but there was something comforting about the simplicity of it all—sandwiches, fresh fruit, cheese, and a bottle of wine.</p><p>Agatha poured them each a glass, handing one to Rio. “To a perfect evening,” she said, raising her glass.</p><p>Rio clinked her glass gently with Agatha’s, a soft smile on her lips. “To us. And to more quiet moments like this.”</p><p>Settled on the blanket, the sounds of nature around them, the occasional chirp of birds or rustling of leaves in the breeze. As they ate and talked, the conversation flowed easily, without any pressure, just two people enjoying each other's company. Agatha was struck by how natural it all felt. Rio wasn’t trying to impress her or make anything more than what it was. She was just there present and attentive, and that made all the difference.</p><p>The sun dipped lower, casting a warm glow on Rio’s face. Agatha couldn’t help but admire the way the light seemed to accentuate the softness in her features, the quiet confidence in the way she held herself. She felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude for this moment, for the way Rio had brought her into a world of calm, of connection, of realness.</p><p>“I’m glad we did this,” Agatha said, her voice low but sincere. “It’s been really nice, just the two of us.”</p><p>Rio glanced at her, her eyes thoughtful. “Me too. It’s nice to have space for just us without everything else getting in the way.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her heart softening. “It is.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze shifted toward the horizon as the last rays of sunlight kissed the earth, the sky now shifting into shades of purple and deep blue. The moment felt timeless, and Agatha found herself wishing it would last forever.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking,” Rio said after a beat, her voice calm but full of meaning. “About us. And what this is.”</p><p>Agatha turned toward her, intrigued. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Rio paused for a moment, gathering her thoughts. “I don’t know what this is, exactly, but I know that when I’m with you, I don’t want it to end. It feels real. And I don’t want to let go of that. I guess what I’m trying to say is that I’m in this, Agatha. Whatever this is.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat, a mixture of surprise and warmth filling her chest. She’d never been one to openly admit when she felt vulnerable, but the honesty in Rio’s voice made her feel like she could open up, too.</p><p>“I’m in it too, Rio,” Agatha replied, her voice steady but her heart racing. “I wasn’t sure at first, but now it’s hard to ignore. It’s like something is happening here, and I don’t want to fight it anymore.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened, her eyes glinting with something between tenderness and relief. “I’m glad to hear that,” she said quietly. “I don’t know where it’s going, but I want to find out.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, reaching out to brush a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. The touch was soft, intimate, and Rio leaned into it, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s. The connection between sparking.</p><p>As the last of the sun disappeared below the horizon, they sat in comfortable silence, just watching the fading colors of the sky. The evening had been perfect—simple, peaceful, and full of promise.</p><p>This, Agatha thought as she sat beside Rio, was what mattered. The noise of the world could wait. For now, it was just them, and the quiet moments that made everything else feel insignificant.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, this was the beginning of something beautiful.</p><p>Agatha sat back against the blanket, her fingers still lightly touching Rio’s. The peaceful silence between them felt perfect, but in the back of her mind, a question had been lingering. The truth was, while everything felt right in this moment, she knew the next few months would bring their own set of challenges.</p><p>The reality of her upcoming tour, the hectic schedule, and the distance, all of it was looming. She couldn’t ignore it any longer.</p><p>Turning slightly to face Rio, Agatha broke the quiet. “Hey… what about the next few months?” she asked, her voice careful, but honest. “I’ve got the tour coming up, and well, I don’t know where that will leave us.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes shifted to her, brows furrowing slightly. She seemed to be processing the question, then nodded slowly, her tone thoughtful. “Yeah, I’ve been thinking about that too. I know things will be different when you’re on the road, but we’ll figure it out, right? I mean, I don’t want this to end before it’s even really began just because you’re busy.”</p><p>Agatha felt a little knot of relief, but she needed to be clear. “I don’t want it to end either,” she said softly, her gaze steady. “But it’s not like we can just ignore the reality of it. I’ll be gone for months, and when I’m on tour, it’s a lot of chaos. Late nights, constant movement and not a lot of time for personal stuff.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look upset—just calm, as though she was processing the challenge rather than running from it. She shrugged a little, giving Agatha a half smile. “We both have our worlds, don’t we? But maybe that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Maybe we can work around it.” She paused for a moment, her gaze softening. “We don’t have to figure everything out right now, Agatha. Let’s just take it day by day, see what happens.”</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a moment, letting the weight of Rio’s words settle in. “You’re right. We don’t need to have all the answers now. But I don’t want you to feel like I’m just disappearing for months, either.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said gently. “I’m not worried about you disappearing. I trust you.” She smiled, her eyes meeting Agatha’s with an honesty that made Agatha’s heart skip. “We’ll be fine. We just have to communicate. And when we can, we make time for each other.”</p><p>Agatha smiled back, feeling a wave of gratitude for Rio’s calm understanding. “I’m glad you feel that way. I just, I don’t want to be one of those people who gets lost in the whirlwind of work and forgets about everything else.” She paused, the weight of her vulnerability making her feel exposed, but it was the truth. She didn’t want to mess this up. “I don’t want to drop this.”</p><p>Rio reached over, brushing her thumb across Agatha’s hand. “You won’t. And I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha felt a deep sense of relief at that, a smile tugging at her lips. “Okay, then. I think, I think we can make this work.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly. “I’m pretty sure we can.”</p><p>They sat in comfortable silence again, the evening’s cool air settling around them as the stars slowly emerged above. It wasn’t a perfect situation—they both knew that—but in the quiet of that moment, it felt like they had all the time in the world to figure it out.</p><p>The next few months would be challenging, no doubt. Agatha would be on tour, traveling from city to city, lost in the hectic schedule of it all. But Rio’s words echoed in her mind: we’ll figure it out. Agatha had never been one to shy away from challenges, this felt like something worth fighting for.</p><p>As the night deepened, Rio leaned back against the blanket, her hand still intertwined with Agatha’s. “I think... we can make this work,” Rio said softly, almost as if she was thinking aloud.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand gently, looking up at the stars. “I agree. And maybe, when I’m on the road, we’ll have little moments to keep us close. Video calls, texts, and who knows? Maybe we can surprise each other.”</p><p>Rio smiled, her voice light and teasing. “I’m already looking forward to the surprises. Just don’t get too busy to miss me.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Agatha promised with a grin. “I’ll miss you more than you think.”</p><p>They shared another quiet smile, both of them in agreement, the uncertainty of the months ahead somehow less daunting now. Whatever came their way, they’d face it together. And that, Agatha realized, was more than enough for now.</p><p>The night stretched on, filled with soft laughter and the comfort of being with someone who understood her more than most ever could. The future was uncertain, but she wasn’t going to let Rio slip away. Not when it felt like this.</p><p>And with that, they watched the stars and listened to the night, knowing they had a little more time to savor moments like this before everything shifted.</p><p>Rio turned her head slightly to look at Agatha. The way the soft light from the moon lingered on Agatha’s face made Rio’s heart race in a way she hadn’t expected. Every word, every glance between them felt like it was drawing them closer, and the quiet intimacy of the moment only heightened that pull.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes met hers the world seemed to stand still. It wasn’t just the closeness, or the way the night felt so perfectly serene—it was everything. Rio could see it in the way Agatha was looking at her, the way her hand was still softly holding hers, the way the evening had unfolded so naturally between them.</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, her chest tightening as she closed the space between them, slowly leaning in. The tension was palpable, like a thread pulling them together, urging them to take that final step.</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat when she saw Rio moving closer, her face so close now that Agatha could feel the warmth of her breath. She wasn’t sure who moved first, but suddenly, their lips met in a kiss that was gentle at first, hesitant, as if both of them were still feeling the weight of everything unspoken between them.</p><p>But then, the kiss deepened, a soft pressure that seemed to unlock something inside Agatha. She responded instantly, her hand reaching up to cup Rio’s face, fingers tracing the smooth line of her jaw. The world seemed to melt away, the sounds of the night blending into a soft hum as she kissed Rio back, hungry for more, feeling every second of their connection in her chest.</p><p>Rio’s hand moved to Agatha’s waist, pulling her closer, and Agatha followed, shifting her body toward Rio as their lips pressed together with more urgency now, each of them silently acknowledging the undeniable chemistry that had been building all week between them.</p><p>Agatha felt a wave of heat flood her body as Rio’s fingers slid across her back, sending shivers down her spine. She could feel Rio’s pulse quickening, the way their bodies were already in sync with each other’s rhythm. It was intoxicating, the way it felt like everything else had faded into the background, and it was just them, wrapped up in the closeness of the kiss.</p><p>When they finally pulled away, breathless, Rio’s gaze locked onto Agatha’s, her eyes dark with desire but still full of tenderness. Agatha’s heart raced, her body alight with anticipation, and before she could say anything, Rio spoke, her voice low and soft.</p><p>“You know, I’ve been wanting to kiss you like that since our last date,” Rio murmured, her fingers gently tracing the outline of Agatha’s lips, as if she couldn’t quite believe they were here.</p><p>Agatha’s smile was slow and sure. “I’ve wanted that too,” she confessed, her voice barely a whisper.</p><p>And then, with a shared understanding, Rio leaned in again, this time guiding Agatha to lie down on the blanket beneath them as she hovered above her, the cool grass soft against their skin. The sky above them was a canvas of soft colors.</p><p>Their kisses became more urgent, more passionate as the minutes passed, each one drawing them further into the moment. Agatha’s hands roamed, tracing the lines of Rio’s shoulders, her back, as if memorizing the feel of her beneath her fingertips. Rio’s hands followed suit, exploring Agatha’s body with a sense of reverence and need, both of them eager but still slow, savoring every touch as though it were something precious.</p><p>The world around them seemed to disappear. The only thing that mattered was the connection they were building with each other. Every kiss felt like a promise, every caress a declaration of how much they wanted this, how much they wanted each other.</p><p>It was a moment of pure intimacy—no crowds, no expectations, just the two of them, their bodies and hearts completely open.</p><p>Rio’s hands moved over Agatha’s skin, their movements growing more urgent, but still tender. Agatha could feel the pulse of her heart in every beat, the warmth of Rio’s touch everywhere, and the sensation was dizzying. She wanted more—wanted to feel all of Rio, wanted to lose herself in this connection, to let go of everything except this moment.</p><p>Rio’s breath came in quick bursts as she leaned down to kiss Agatha again, the kiss deep and full of emotion. Agatha responded, lifting her hands to pull Rio closer, needing her just as much. The sensation of being held, of being wanted, was overwhelming in the best way. Everything about this felt so right, so natural.</p><p>Their movements were slow, deliberate, each touch and kiss drawing them closer, but it wasn’t just about the physical—it was the emotional bond that deepened with every passing second. Agatha could feel her heart racing, but there was no fear, only a quiet certainty that this was where she was meant to be.</p><p>When they finally reached that point of shared release, the world felt suspended, as if time had slowed down, and all that existed was them, wrapped up in the tenderness of the moment. They held each other closely, their foreheads resting together, breathless but content.</p><p>Agatha let out a soft laugh, her chest still rising and falling with the intensity of everything they had just shared. “That was... wow,” she murmured, a little in awe.</p><p>Rio smiled, her fingers gently tracing Agatha’s arm. “Yeah. It was.”</p><p>They lay together, entwined, watching the stars. The warmth of their bodies and the quiet of the night felt like the perfect end to a perfect evening.</p><p>The uncertainty of the future, the challenges that lay ahead, all of it seemed a little less daunting now. Rio was here. And whatever the next few months brought, Agatha knew they’d face it together.</p><p>“Im not usually a sleep with you on the second date type of girl, but this feels different,” Agatha whispered, her voice soft as she nuzzled Rio’s neck.</p><p>Rio smiled, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s hair. “Me too. And no matter what happens next... I’m here. For you.”</p><p>And in that moment, with the quiet hum of the world around them and the soft glow of the stars above, Agatha knew that this was just the beginning.</p>

<p>The days before Agatha left for tour felt heavier than she had expected. The weight of saying goodbye, even for just a few months, hung in the air. As the minutes ticked closer to her departure, Agatha couldn’t help but feel the familiar twinge of anxiety that came with change.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the couch, her legs crossed, her fingers absently tracing the edge of a coffee mug. The soft sound of Salem’s tail thumping against the floor filled the space between them, a comforting reminder of home, of the life she was leaving behind, even temporarily.</p><p>Rio sat beside her, her head resting against the back of the couch, looking at Agatha with that calm, steady gaze that always made her feel like everything would be okay.</p><p>“So,” Agatha said after a moment, breaking the silence, “When I’m gone, on the road... I mean, we’re still figuring this out. And never really dated, never mind done the long-distance stuff, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s smile softened, and she leaned in a little closer, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s. “I get it. It’s not easy. But we can figure it out. You’ve already got a plan, don’t you?”</p><p>Agatha paused, her thoughts swirling. She hadn’t exactly planned for this—whatever this was—but now that Rio was here, now that she had something real to hold on to, she wanted to try. “Yeah, I think I do. Just... take it one step at a time.”</p><p>They both fell silent, the words settling between them. It wasn’t a promise, not yet, but it was a start.</p><p>After a few moments, Rio sat up straight, her eyes bright with a mischievous gleam. “So,” she said, glancing toward the clock on the wall, “before you go, I’ve got one last thing for you.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Oh? And what might that be?”</p><p>Rio stood, holding out her hand. “Come to my place. You, me, Salem—let’s have one last night together before you leave. I’ll even make you a proper goodbye dinner.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated for only a moment, then took Rio’s hand. The offer was too tempting, too perfect. “Well, when you put it that way...” she said with a smile, “how could I say no?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Exactly. And you know, maybe we’ll make some memories to keep you warm on the road, huh?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, standing up. “Oh, I’m sure we will.”</p><p>Salem, sensing the shift in energy, gave a soft whine and bounced up onto her feet, tail wagging. Agatha bent down to scoop her into her arms, smiling at Rio. “I think Salem’s in agreement too.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes sparkled. “I’ll take good care of her too. She’s a part of this, after all.”</p><p>As they left her home, Agatha felt a lightness she hadn’t expected. The impending tour still loomed, but for now, it was just her, Rio, and Salem—nothing more, nothing less. A simple night, filled with the promise of another memory they could share before the world got too busy again.</p><p>The drive to Rio’s house was quiet, with Salem resting comfortably in Agatha’s lap, her soft fur providing a grounding sense of normalcy amidst all the change. The streetlights flashed by, and the world felt at once familiar and new. It was strange—knowing that tomorrow she’d be leaving, that the rhythm of her life would change for the next few months—but there was something about Rio, something about this connection that made everything feel like it would be okay.</p><p>When they arrived at Rio’s house, Agatha was pleasantly surprised. It wasn’t large, but it had a cozy, welcoming vibe that immediately put her at ease. The soft glow of light spilled from the windows, and as she stepped inside, the scent of vanilla filled the air.</p><p>“I didn’t know you could cook,” Agatha teased as Rio led them into the kitchen.</p><p>“For you,” Rio replied, her voice warm, a little shy, as she reached for a pan on the stove. “Besides, it’s the least I can do.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, setting Salem down and watching as she immediately explored the space, sniffing around curiously. “You didn’t have to, you know.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said, glancing over at her. “But I wanted to. I know it’s a weird time, with you leaving tomorrow, but I thought we could have a nice, quiet night before things get crazy.”</p><p>Agatha felt a lump form in her throat. She hadn’t expected this, but it felt so right. It felt like they were both giving each other a small gift—time, before everything got hectic.</p><p>“I appreciate it,” Agatha said softly. She crossed the room to where Rio was standing by the stove, her heart swelling with affection. She took a moment to just look at Rio, taking in the way the soft light from the kitchen illuminated her features. “You really are something special, you know that?”</p><p>Rio’s smile softened. “I think you’re pretty special too.”</p><p>And in that moment, Agatha realized that whatever came next—whatever the distance and the challenges of the tour might bring—this connection was worth putting effort into. And for the first time in a while, she felt like maybe, just maybe, everything would be okay.</p><p>As they sat down at the dinner table, Salem curled up at Agatha’s feet, contentedly munching on a treat. The warmth of Rio’s cozy kitchen, the flickering candlelight, and the smell of the food filled the space with a peaceful comfort. But as much as Agatha tried to relax, her thoughts kept drifting back to the reality of what lay ahead—her tour, her persona, and the inevitable challenges that came with it.</p><p>They had talked about light things, casual topics—the kind of conversation that felt easy and natural. But there was something heavier on Agatha’s mind now, something she couldn’t avoid much longer. She pushed her plate away slightly, her gaze turning inward for a moment before meeting Rio’s.</p><p>“Rio, there’s something I need to talk to you about,” Agatha said, her voice a little quieter than usual. Rio looked up, her expression immediately softening in concern.</p><p>“What’s on your mind?” she asked, setting down her fork and giving Agatha her full attention.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, unsure of how to bring it up. She wanted to be open, but it was hard—talking about her public persona felt like admitting to something that didn’t quite align with who she was when she wasn’t on stage. She took a deep breath.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking about the tour, and about... Harkness,” she began, her tone reflective. “You know what it’s like, right? The whole thing—the costumes, the moves, the... image. I’m going to be on stage, wearing revealing outfits, making provocative moves... it’s all part of the show.”</p><p>Rio didn’t immediately respond, her eyes scanning Agatha’s face as if sensing the weight of what she was about to say. Agatha continued, her voice soft but steady.</p><p>“It’s part of the persona. It’s the part of me the fans see, the part they want. But it’s not really me—not the me you see.”</p><p>She paused, her fingers gently tracing the edge of her plate. “It’s just, I can’t help but feel like I’m about to step into this other world, and I don’t know if I’ve really explained it to you before. There’s a lot of attention that comes with being Harkness. It’s like I’m a character. And I’m worried about how that might affect things between us.”</p><p>Rio sat back in her chair, her expression thoughtful, as if she were processing everything Agatha had said. Then, after a long beat, she spoke, her voice gentle and reassuring.</p><p>“Agatha, I know who you are,” Rio said, her eyes meeting Agatha’s. “I know who you are, not just the persona you put on for the world. I trust you. And I don’t have any illusions about what being with someone in your position means. I know that your career is part of who you are, but it doesn’t change the way I see you, the way I feel about you.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened at the sincerity in Rio’s voice, but she still felt a flicker of uncertainty. “But what about everything else? The fans, the attention... I’ll be on stage, practically throwing myself at the crowd, wearing next to nothing, but it’s part of the show, and it’s hard to keep that boundary sometimes.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly, a reassuring warmth in her gaze. “You’re not throwing yourself at anyone. You’re performing. I get that. And yes, I’ll admit, it might be a bit overwhelming for me sometimes. But I trust you, Agatha. I trust that you know where the line is, and I trust that who you are offstage is who you really are, no matter what persona you wear on stage. I’m not going to judge you for it.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. The weight of the conversation lightened just a little, but there was still something she needed to ask—something she wasn’t quite sure of.</p><p>Rio reached across the table, her hand landing softly on Agatha’s. “If it gets hard, we talk about it. If you start feeling lost in it all, I’ll be here. I’m not going anywhere, Agatha. I’m not going to walk away because of what you do on stage. I want to support you, no matter what role you’re playing. You’re you, and I happen to really like you.”</p><p>The reassurance in Rio’s voice steadied Agatha’s nerves. She didn’t know what would happen once she was out on the road—how much she’d be able to compartmentalise her public persona from her private self. She wasn’t sure how she’d feel after weeks of the constant pressure, the attention. But Rio’s words were grounding, and that gave her some comfort.</p><p>“I just want to make sure we’re okay,” Agatha said quietly. “I don’t want to lose you in the process of this... this whirlwind that’s about to start.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly, giving her hand a gentle squeeze. “Agatha, I’m not going anywhere. I know it’s not going to be easy, and there might be moments when things get complicated, but I believe in us. And I believe in you. I trust you to navigate this, and I trust that we’ll find a way to make it work. Whatever happens, we’re in this together.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, a little shakily, but feeling lighter than she had in hours. She wasn’t sure what the future would hold, but in this moment, with Rio’s hand in hers, it felt like maybe they could handle whatever came next.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha whispered. “For trusting me.”</p><p>Rio’s smile deepened. “Of course. And just know, I’m still a fan and I’m proud of you. I’ll be cheering you on every step of the way.”</p><p>Agatha felt a sense of warmth spread through her at Rio’s words, she was going to hold onto this feeling—the feeling of being seen, trusted, and understood.</p><p>And maybe that was all she needed to take with her as she stepped into the next chapter of her life.</p><p>As the evening settled into quiet comfort, the conversation between Agatha and Rio drifted off, leaving behind a peaceful, intimate silence. After dinner, they moved to the living room, where they curled up together on the couch, with Salem nestled on the cushions between them. There was a sense of ease between them now, something that had deepened over the few weeks they’d been getting to know one another. The tension and uncertainty that had filled their earlier conversations had mostly melted away, replaced by the simple joy of just being together.</p><p>Rio’s hand was gently resting on Agatha’s thigh, fingers lightly tracing the fabric of her jeans. The closeness felt natural, effortless.<br/>Rio shifted slightly, her gaze still soft, but something in her expression had changed. It was subtle, but Agatha noticed it—the way Rio’s eyes lingered a little longer on her, as though searching for something, as though she was about to ask a question that had been on her mind for a while.</p><p>“What is it?” Agatha asked softly, glancing up at Rio.</p><p>Rio hesitated, her fingers stilling on Agatha’s leg. “I’ve been thinking, and I want to ask you something.” She paused, collecting her thoughts before continuing. “What are we, Agatha? I mean... what is this?”</p><p>The question hung in the air, simple but loaded. Agatha felt her heart skip a beat, a mixture of vulnerability and anticipation creeping in. They hadn’t defined things yet, hadn’t put a label on what they were, but what they had felt so real—so undeniable—that it seemed like they didn’t need one.</p><p>But the question was there, unavoidable.</p><p>Agatha shifted to face Rio, her hand gently brushing against Rio’s arm. She wanted to answer, to tell Rio that she wanted more than just a fleeting connection, more than just the comfort of a casual fling. But there was something about the moment that made her hesitate.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha admitted, her voice soft. “I’ve been wondering the same thing. I know I feel something for you. Something that’s different from anything I’ve felt before. But I’m not sure what to call it. We’ve only known each other for just under three weeks, and I’m about to leave for months. It’s not exactly the most ideal situation for figuring this out.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her eyes reflecting a mixture of understanding and something else—something almost wistful. “Yeah, I get that. But I think we both know it’s more than just casual. It’s more than just a ‘thing.’”</p><p>Agatha’s heart fluttered at Rio’s words. “It is more,” she agreed, her voice low, the uncertainty giving way to something steadier. “I don’t know what we’re supposed to be or how it’s going to work when I’m gone. But I don’t want to just walk away from this.”</p><p>Rio smiled then, a soft, knowing smile that made Agatha’s pulse quicken. She leaned in, her breath warm against Agatha’s ear. “You don’t have to walk away,” she whispered, her voice a soothing balm to the unease that had been growing in Agatha’s chest. “We don’t have to figure it all out right now. But I want you to know that I’m in this, Agatha. Whatever this is, I’m in.”</p><p>The weight of Rio’s words made Agatha’s heart swell, a rush of emotions flooding through her. She reached out, cupping Rio’s cheek gently, her thumb brushing the soft skin beneath her fingers. There was something about the way Rio looked at her—something so sincere and grounding—that made her feel like she could lean into this connection without fear.</p><p>Rio’s hand moved to Agatha’s waist, her touch gentle, but with an underlying urgency. She shifted closer, her lips hovering just above Agatha’s.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Agatha asked, her voice barely a whisper. “I don’t want to complicate things for you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, and she nodded. “I’m sure. No matter what happens, I wont regret this.”</p><p>And with that, their lips met in a kiss that felt like it was both an answer and a question all at once—gentle, but full of promise. The kiss deepened slowly, each of them exploring the other, learning, savoring. Agatha’s heart beat faster with each passing moment, each soft press of lips, each tender touch.</p><p>Eventually, the kiss broke, and Rio, her breath shallow, stood up and held out her hand. “Come to bed with me,” she said, her voice soft and inviting, almost a question in itself.</p><p>Agatha hesitated for a brief moment, uncertainty still lingering, but then she reached for Rio’s hand, her heart pulling her forward. “Okay,” she whispered, a flutter in her chest.</p><p>They moved to Rio’s bedroom, a quiet tension settling between them, but it wasn’t the kind of tension that felt wrong. It was the kind that felt like something new, something beautiful.</p><p>Once in the dimly lit room, Rio turned to Agatha, her eyes soft, yet intense. There was no rush, no pressure—just the soft exchange of glances and touches. She reached for Agatha’s shirt, pulling it gently over her head, and Agatha followed suit, shedding her clothes as she felt the cool night air kiss her skin.</p><p>They stood there for a moment, the soft light from the window casting shadows across their bodies. Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio stepped closer, her hands brushing against Agatha’s skin, her touch like fire. Agatha leaned in, her lips meeting Rio’s again, deeper this time—more urgent.</p><p>Rio guided them toward the bed, their bodies moving together in a rhythm that felt like it had always been there. When they finally sank into the sheets, it was with a tenderness that contrasted with the desire that had built between them. Rio’s hands were gentle as they caressed Agatha’s body, exploring with a kind of reverence, as if she were savoring every inch of her.</p><p>Agatha’s hands mirrored Rio’s, tracing the lines of her back, pulling her closer, feeling the heat of Rio’s skin against her own. The world outside felt like it had disappeared, leaving only the two of them, tangled in the quiet intimacy of the moment.</p><p>When they finally came together, it was slow and deliberate—each movement a careful exploration, a connection that spoke louder than words. Agatha’s heart raced as Rio’s lips moved over her skin, and she found herself lost in the feeling of being wanted, of being truly seen. It wasn’t just about the physical—the way they moved together—but about the unspoken promises they were making to each other in the quiet space between their breaths.</p><p>As they finally lay there, tangled in the sheets, Rio pulled Agatha close, her arms wrapping around her, holding her in a comforting embrace.</p><p>Agatha’s head rested against Rio’s chest, and for a long moment, neither of them spoke. The only sound was the soft rhythm of their breathing, slow and steady, as the weight of the night settled between them.</p><p>Rio’s voice broke the silence, her words quiet but meaningful. “What a goodbye, huh?”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly, feeling the weight of the question but not needing an immediate answer. She lifted her head to meet Rio’s gaze, her eyes reflecting the same tenderness that filled her heart.</p><p>“The best goodbye,” Agatha murmured. “But we still have until morning, I think we should make the most of it.”</p><p>Rio smiled, brushing a strand of hair from Agatha’s face. “Me too,” she whispered, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s forehead.</p><p>In that moment, under the quiet glow of the night, they both understood: they didn’t have to have all the answers. They didn’t have to define it right then and there. What mattered was that they were here, together, in this moment. And for tonight, that was enough.</p>

<p>The next morning, the sun had barely risen, casting a soft orange glow over Rio's bedroom as Agatha dressed. Salem, who had been curled up on the couch all night, wagged her tail as Agatha gathered her bag. There was a quiet heaviness in the air, a mix of anticipation and sadness.</p><p>Rio stood by the door, her hands tucked into the pockets of her joggers, watching her with a gaze that was both proud and reluctant. Agatha could feel the weight of Rio's presence beside her, but there was also something reassuring about it.</p><p>“Are you sure you’ll be okay?” Agatha asked softly, pausing as she picked up Salem’s leash. She didn’t want to leave, not really, but she knew the tour was waiting for her, and the reality of it was unavoidable.</p><p>Rio smiled gently, though there was a hint of sadness in her eyes. “I’ll be fine. I know you have to do this, Agatha. It’s your career.”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, feeling the warmth of Rio’s body as she wrapped her arms around her. “I’ll miss you,” she whispered into Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“I’ll miss you too.” Rio’s voice was thick with emotion, but she didn’t pull away. “But hey, this isn’t goodbye forever, okay? Just for a little while.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, pulling back just enough to look at Rio. “I know. But it’s going to be hard. Not seeing you... not being able to just be with you.”</p><p>Rio brushed a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear, her touch tender. “We’ll make it work. We’ll figure it out.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, though her heart felt heavy. “I’m lucky to have you, Rio.”</p><p>“Right back at you,” Rio said, her lips curling into a soft smile. She took a deep breath before leaning in, pressing a soft purposeful kiss to Agatha’s lips. “Go on. I’ll be waiting when you get back.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her again, lingering for a moment, before breaking away. She took a final look around before moving to the door.</p><p>“Come on, baby,” Agatha said, her voice quieter now as she walked Salem. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Rio followed her to the door, opening it wide to let the morning breeze in. Outside, Lilias car was waiting, parked just down the street, ready to take Agatha tomorrow the tour bus. The anticipation in the air was palpable, but so was the weight of the goodbye.</p><p>“Call me when you get there, okay?” Rio said, her voice soft but insistent.</p><p>“I will,” Agatha promised, giving Rio one last, lingering kiss before stepping out onto the sidewalk.</p><p>Lilia waved out the window as Agatha approached, Salem trotting happily beside her. She gave Rio one last smile before climbing into the passenger seat, the door closing behind her. As the car pulled away, Agatha looked out the window, seeing Rio standing there, watching her go, a mix of pride and sadness etched on her face.</p><p>The drive home to get her things felt longer than it was, as though the distance between them had suddenly stretched, giving her more time to reflect. Salem sat happily in her lap, but there was an undeniable ache in her chest. It was strange, this feeling of leaving something so real behind.</p><p>“How’s my girl?”, Lilia asked as she stood at the door with her case.</p><p>“I’m good, Mom,” Agatha said, hugging her back tightly. “Just... ready to get on the road, I guess.”</p><p>“I bet,” her mom said, pulling back and looking at her closely. “But, your homes always here..Im always here.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, feeling a mixture of gratitude and longing. She had always loved being home, but the pull of the tour, the excitement of what was ahead, was stronger now. She knelt down to let Salem say goodbye to Lilia, the little dog wagging her tail eagerly as always.</p><p>Her mom chuckled and ruffled Salem’s fur. “It’s going to be quite the adventure for her,” her mom said, walking with Agatha towards the waiting bus. “And for you, too, I imagine.”</p><p>“It is,” Agatha admitted. “But... it’s hard. Leaving Rio behind. It’s only been a few weeks, but it feels like so much more.”</p><p>Her mom gave her a knowing look. “I can tell. You’ve never looked at anyone the way you look at her, Agatha. It’s different.”</p><p>“I think so too,” Agatha said, “But it’s complicated. I don’t know what’s going to happen. I’m going to be gone for months, and I don’t want her to think I’m leaving her behind.”</p><p>“It’s okay to be scared, Agatha. It’s okay to not know what’s coming. But what’s important is that you’re both honest with each other. That’s the key to making it work, no matter the distance.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, taking a deep breath. Her mom always had a way of putting things into perspective. “I’ll try to be. I just don’t want to mess it up.”</p><p>“You won’t,” her mom reassured her. “But don’t let the distance make you second-guess what you feel. You have something real there. And sometimes, that’s enough to get through the tough parts.”</p><p>Agatha smiled at her mom, feeling a little lighter. “Thanks, Mom.”</p><p>It was finally time to say goodbye. Agatha hugged her tightly, her mom’s arms strong around her, giving her one last moment of warmth before the next chapter. Salem trotted happily behind her as Agatha stepped back onto the bus.</p><p>The tour was waiting for her. It was time to go.</p><p>As the bus doors closed and the engine started, Agatha glanced out the window one last time. Her mom was standing there, watching her go, a small but encouraging wave in the distance. Agatha waved back, feeling both the excitement and the bittersweet sting of leaving behind what she loved.</p><p>The day after Agatha’s departure, the members of the band were getting ready for the tour to kick off. Agatha decided to give their fans a sneak peek of what they could expect during the upcoming tour. The photo was a fun, behind-the-scenes shot of the band, all of them wearing the latest tour merch, ready to hit the road. The four of them were gathered outside their tour bus, and the energy was palpable.</p><p>Harkness was front and center, her wild hair tumbling around her shoulders in messy waves, holding Salem in her arms as the dog gave the camera a curious look. She’d tied her tour shirt at the side, revealing her toned stomach, and the casual, laid-back pose had a magnetic quality to it. Alice was on the far left, grinning widely with her guitar slung across her back, while Jennifer stood next to her, leaning against the bus with her bass, giving a wink to the camera. Loki, with his mischievous grin, stood slightly behind them, arms crossed over his drumsticks, ready for the chaos to begin.</p><p>The caption for the photo read:<br/>Ready to hit the road with the best crew. Tour starts tomorrow—let’s do this! #TourLife #BandFam #LetsGo</p><p>Within minutes of Harkness posting the photo, the comments section exploded. Fans had already been waiting for updates, and this image gave them exactly what they craved—a glimpse into the chaotic, fun energy the band always seemed to have. But it wasn't just their excitement for the tour that caught attention; it was the undeniable appeal of Harkness herself, casually holding Salem in her arms, exuding effortless cool with her exposed stomach and wild hair.</p><p>@musicfan_19: Harkness is out here making me reconsider my entire life 😍🔥 #AbsGoal</p><p>@wildheart_vibes: I need a Salem in my life. Also, Harkness can I just... can we just? 😜</p><p>@fannumberone: Harkness, you’re seriously stunning. Can we just talk about those abs tho?? 😳</p><p>@salemfan99: Okay but Salem deserves her own tour tbh 😍🐾</p><p>@guitarqueen94: The band is fire but that Harkness energy?? I’m DONE. 😫🔥</p><p>Even Alice, Jennifer, and Loki got their fair share of comments, but it was clear that the attention was all on Harkness, and her fans were more than happy to let her know how much they admired her.</p><p>@lokithesheep: Can’t be mad when you have such a good group of people to tour with, but Harkness is really out here stealing the spotlight 😂🔥</p><p>@aliceplaysguitar: Just waiting for my turn to steal the spotlight 💀</p><p>@jen_bassqueen: We’re all just here for the Salem content honestly 🐾</p><p>Harkness read through the comments with a smile, shaking her head at the sheer amount of attention. It wasn’t new for her—she’d been in the spotlight for years—but it always amused her how fans could go from admiring her music to thirsting over her in the blink of an eye. Still, it was a reminder of the role she played in the public eye. But more than that, it reminded her of the world outside of her relationship with Rio.</p><p>Her phone buzzed with a message notification, and Agatha smiled when she saw the name.</p><p>Rio: Hey, I saw your post. You’re making people thirsty again, huh?</p><p>Agatha chuckled to herself, her thumb quickly typing out a response.</p><p>Agatha: They just can’t handle the Harkness energy, sweetheart. 😏</p><p>Her phone buzzed again almost instantly.</p><p>Rio: But I can 😈</p><p>Agatha grinned, the playful banter making her heart race. She was already missing Rio, but at least their late-night chats and constant teasing kept the connection alive. She tossed her phone back into her bag and looked at the other band members.</p><p>They were all excited. Nervous, maybe, but ready to get on that stage. The tour was about to start, and for the first time, Agatha felt a little more grounded than usual. Despite all the attention from fans, despite everything that was about to come, her mind always drifted back to Rio. She couldn’t wait to see her again, but for now, it was time to do what she did best—perform.</p><p>She turned to the group, giving them a wink. “Alright, team. Let’s make some magic happen.”</p><p>The tour bus hummed with the sound of the engine as it sped down the highway, the open road stretching out in front of them. The night was peaceful, but not entirely quiet—there was light chatter coming from the back of the bus, where the band was scattered, joking around and getting ready for the first show. Agatha, who had taken a seat near the front, was scrolling through her phone, her thoughts lingering on Rio. She’d only been away for a day, but it felt longer. Missing her was the kind of ache that gnawed at her, especially since things had been so intense between them before she left.</p><p>With a sigh, she leaned back in her seat, her thumb hovering over Rio’s contact on her phone. There was a pull in her chest to hear her voice, to feel the comfort of their connection. Without thinking much more about it, she pressed call.</p><p>It rang a few times before Rio’s voice came through, soft and familiar. “Hey you,” Rio greeted warmly.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha replied, a smile tugging at her lips. “How’s everything going? I miss you already.”</p><p>“I miss you too,” Rio chuckled. “It’s been less than 24 hours, Agatha. You sure you’re not getting homesick?”</p><p>Harkness laughed softly, leaning back in her seat. “I think I am. It’s so weird not having you around. Even Salem’s been acting all confused, just staring out the window.”</p><p>Rio’s laugh was light, teasing. “Well, Salems going to steal the show isnt she?”</p><p>“Right?” Agatha grinned, looking out the window for a moment. “It’s just so weird how much I’m missing being home.”</p><p>Rio’s voice softened, a comforting warmth in it. “I know, It’s weird for me too, but it’s just a few months. We can make it through this. And I’m only a phone call away.”</p><p>Agatha felt a wave of affection, the kind that made her heart swell. She was already counting down the days until she could see Rio again. But just as she was about to respond, the unmistakable sound of the band’s laughter echoed from the back of the bus.</p><p>“Who are you calling? Your girlfriend?” She could hear Loki’s teasing shout.</p><p>The entire bus erupted in a chorus of exaggerated whistles and groans.</p><p>Agathas face flushed with embarrassment, though she tried to hide it. She glanced back, only to see the band members mimicking exaggerated kissing motions at her. She shot them a glare, but they weren’t having any of it.</p><p>“Shut up, you guys,” she muttered into the phone, her voice laced with a mix of affection and annoyance.</p><p>Rio’s voice came through, full of amusement. “Sounds like your bandmates are having fun with this.”</p><p>“Yeah, they’re impossible,” Agatha sighed. “I swear, they won’t let me live this down. But, hey, I can’t help it if you’re seriously hot though” she teased with a playful grin.</p><p>“Oh, stop,” Rio laughed. “But seriously, don’t let them give you too much of a hard time. You’re on the road, go have fun. I’ll be here when you’re ready to talk.”</p><p>“I’ll try,” Harkness said, chuckling at the antics in the background. “But you know - they’re relentless.”</p><p>Agatha turned around again, only to see Alice dramatically placing her hand over her heart, fanning herself like she was swooning. "Hey, how’s your girlfriend doing?" she yelled loudly, clearly putting on an over-the-top show for the rest of the crew. Jennifer was laughing and shaking her head, while Loki mimed a phone call with his fingers, exaggeratedly blowing kisses in Agathas direction.</p><p>“Alright, alright,” Agatha said, rolling her eyes but also trying to keep a straight face. “You’re all terrible. Absolutely terrible.”</p><p>“You’re cute when you’re embarrassed,” Alice called from the back, earning a chorus of "Oooh"s from the band.</p><p>Rio’s voice broke through the noise, still amused. “You’re too cute. And don’t worry about them, I’m sure they’re just jealous of how perfect you are.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but grin, feeling a rush of warmth. “I miss you.”</p><p>“I miss you too,” Rio said softly. “But you’ll be back before you know it. You’ve got this.”</p><p>The playful banter continued as the night went on, but even as she joined in with the teasing and laughed along with her bandmates, part of her stayed connected to Rio, even across the distance. The call ended with a promise to talk again soon, and when Agatha put the phone down, the teasing from the band hadn’t died down.</p><p>“Did she say she misses you? Should we be sending flowers next?” Loki grinned from the back.</p><p>Agatha shot him a look over her shoulder. “Shut it, Loki.”</p><p>But despite their relentless teasing, Agatha found herself smiling. It wasn’t just the teasing. It was the warmth that Rio gave her, the comfort of hearing her voice even through the chaos of the band.</p><p>"Alright, alright, but next time, don’t be so obvious about it," Loki said, still grinning.</p><p>“I can’t help it if your girlfriend is that cute,” Alice teased, leaning against the bus wall with a smirk.</p><p>“Alright, enough,” Agatha muttered, turning the volume of her music up. She had a show to get ready for.</p><p>But as she sat back in her seat, a little smile tugged at her lips. She could hear the band still whispering and laughing in the background, but all she could think about was Rio. It was only the beginning of the tour, but already, it felt like everything was just a little bit sweeter with Rio in her life.</p><p>She found herself dialing another number, this time a number she knew all too well.</p><p>Her mom, Lilia.</p><p>The phone rang, and it was only a few moments before the familiar voice came through the receiver. “Hey, sweetheart! How’s the road treating you?”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly, the sound of her mom’s voice comforting in the midst of the busy chaos. “Hey, Mom. It’s good. Just getting started, you know? Long ride, but I’m doing okay.”</p><p>“You sound a little tired,” Lilia commented. “Are you eating properly? You’ve been home for only three weeks, so I know how easy it can be to slip into bad habits. Don’t forget to take care of yourself.”</p><p>“I’m fine, Mom,” Agatha said, though she couldn’t help but smile at how familiar her mom’s concern sounded. “You worry too much.”</p><p>“It's my job to worry,” Lilia replied lightly, but there was a sharpness in her voice that suggested she wasn’t completely letting it go.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath. “I’m good, I promise. I think I’m just getting used to the routine again. It’s a little different, you know? Being away and all.”</p><p>There was a pause on the other end, a moment of quiet before Lilia spoke again, more carefully. “I know it’s hard. It’s always been a big transition. But I also know you’re tough. You’ve got this, sweetheart.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but smile. Her mom always had a way of easing her mind, even if only a little. “Thanks, Mom. I’ll be fine. Just... missing home a bit. Missing you.”</p><p>“I miss you too,” Lilia said softly. “But you’re doing what you’ve always dreamed of. I’m proud of you.”</p><p>There was another pause, but this one felt more reflective, as if her mom was considering something important. “Have you got your rings?”</p><p>Agatha glanced down at her hands. The familiar weight on her fingers—the rings she had worn for years, the ones she hadn’t felt the need to wear during the break at home.<br/>The rings were back on, settled snugly in place. The worry rings. They hadn’t been a part of her for weeks, but now, they were back on her hands, “Yeah, I’m wearing them again.”</p><p>Lilia didn’t sound surprised, but there was a softness in her voice as she responded. “When you’re feeling stressed or uncertain, give them a spin and think of me. Just remember to breathe, okay?”</p><p>“Yeah, I will,” Harkness murmured, feeling a pang in her chest. It was a small, quiet comfort that always kept her grounded, even if it was a little symbolic at times. L</p><p>“And how’s everything Rio?” Lilia asked, voice quieter now, almost cautious.</p><p>The question caught Agatha off guard, but she managed a smile despite herself. "Good, mom."</p><p>“Yeah?,” Lilia’s voice was gentle, probing but without judgement.</p><p>Agatha felt her heart skip a beat,"Better than good, actually. I think I’m... I think I’m falling for her, Mom. And it’s different. It’s real. It feels right, but also a little scary, you know?"</p><p>There was a long pause on the other end of the line, but when Lilia spoke again, her voice was warm and understanding. “I’m happy for you, sweetheart. I know how much you’ve longed for something real, something that feels right. ”</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha responded, her heart swelling at her mom’s words. " I’m definitely excited about what’s to come."</p><p>"That’s good to hear. Just keep me updated, alright? I want to know how everything is going with both you and her. I’m here whenever you need to talk."</p><p>“Thanks, Mom,” Agatha said softly. "I will. I’ll ring you everyday. I promise."</p><p>She smiled, her fingers running over the rings again, grounding herself as the bus continued down the road. With everything ahead of her—both the tour and the feelings she was still figuring out with Rio—there was a sense of peace settling in. For the first time in a long time, she felt like she was exactly where she was meant to be.</p><p>With her mom’s support and Rio in her life, Agatha felt like she could handle anything. And for the first time in a while, the rings felt like a symbol of strength, not worry.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The first stop of the tour was the Prudential Center in New Jersey, a massive, sold-out stadium that felt like it could swallow the band whole. The energy backstage was electric, and the buzz of excitement filled the air. Agatha could feel the hum of the crowd from where she was standing, ready for what would be a legendary opening night. She was ready to give it everything she had.</p><p>But before hitting the stage, there was the inevitable: press. The interview was scheduled, and Agatha had mentally prepared herself for the usual chaos that came with it. She wasn’t exactly known for her serious answers, but that was the fun part, wasn’t it?</p><p>When the interviewer greeted her, Harkness gave a wide, mischievous grin and took a seat, all while the camera crew set up around her.</p><p>"Alright, Harkness, thank you for taking the time to speak with us today," the interviewer said, clearly excited, but trying to maintain composure. "The tour has just begun, and you’re here at the Prudential Center, sold out. How does it feel to be kicking things off in front of such a huge crowd?"</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms casually as she shot a playful glance at the interviewer. "Well, it feels a little like I’m about to be devoured by thousands of screaming fans, but I’m not complaining."</p><p>The interviewer laughed, clearly not sure whether she was joking or serious. "You’re known for being... shall we say, a little sarcastic. Is that just part of your stage persona, or is that the real Harkness?"</p><p>Agatha smirked, enjoying the banter. "Oh, no, this is the real Harkness. If I’m being honest, I’ve got a collection of sarcastic remarks waiting to be used. I find humor in everything—life’s too short to take too seriously. Plus, sarcasm keeps me from getting sued. You know, liability issues and all that."</p><p>The interviewer raised an eyebrow, clearly amused. "So, you're not nervous at all about tonight? I mean, it’s a huge show—first night on the tour, sold out crowd, all eyes on you."</p><p>"Nervous?" Agatha repeated with a dramatic pause, tilting her head. "Me? Nah. I’ve been in front of crowds for years. I thrive on the chaos, really. What’s not to love about thousands of people screaming my name?" She shrugged casually. "It’s kind of like being at a family reunion."</p><p>There was a brief moment of silence before the interviewer tried to shift gears. "Well, we’ve seen you evolve a lot as an artist over the years. You’ve gone from small circuits to headlining massive venues like this one. How has that transformation been for you?"</p><p>Agatha snorted. "Transformation? Oh, you mean the part where I just pretend I’ve got it all together, but really, I’m just winging it?" She leaned forward, her expression serious for a second, before her signature grin returned. "Honestly, it’s been wild. I used to play tiny dive bars where the stage was the size of a bathroom. Now, I’m here. It’s insane, really. I’m basically just making it up as I go. But if you can’t have fun with it, what’s the point?"</p><p>"That’s one way to look at it," the interviewer said, trying to hide a chuckle. "So, now that you’ve made it, do you find yourself changing your approach to music? Are you focusing more on the performance aspect, or is it still all about the music for you?"</p><p>Agatha leaned back again, glancing over her shoulder at the stage crew prepping in the background. "Look, I’m here for both—performance and music. You can’t have one without the other, right? I mean, what’s the point of writing a killer song if you can’t make people move their feet, or even better, make them cry into their overpriced concert drinks? It’s a balance, but hey, if you’ve got a killer band behind you—which I do- it’s like a well-oiled machine. It just works."</p><p>"Speaking of the band," the interviewer said, clearly eager to get a juicy tidbit, "we’ve heard some interesting rumors about the dynamics within your band. Any truth to the reports that there’s tension behind the scenes?"</p><p>Agatha laughed outright, shaking her head. "Tension? What are you talking about? Tension’s overrated. We’re all family. Yeah, we mess with each other—everyone’s got their quirks, you know? But we all share one thing in common: the love of chaos. And honestly, if there’s no chaos, what are we even doing? But no, nothing crazy. We're like siblings who bicker constantly but will always have each other’s backs when it matters most. Plus, if there were any real tension, you’d hear it in the music. Trust me, it’s all in the sound."</p><p>"That’s a good way to put it," the interviewer said, nodding thoughtfully. "Alright, before we wrap up, any final words for your fans before you go on stage?"</p><p>Agatha grinned widely, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "Oh, absolutely. To all my fans out there: You all paid money to see me tonight, which is super flattering. So, you better scream loud enough to make me think I’m on fire. No pressure, right? And if you don’t—well, I’ll be over here on stage pretending to be a rock god, and you can just pretend to enjoy it." She winked at the camera. "But seriously, thank you. You guys make this all worth it."</p><p>The interviewer laughed, clearly relieved that she’d survived the chaos. “Well, Haroness, we’ll let you get ready for your big performance. Thank you for chatting with us. We can’t wait to see you on stage tonight.”</p><p>Agatha stood up, pushing her chair back with a dramatic flourish. "Of course. You’re welcome. And remember, everyone, I’m perfectly sane, no matter what the internet says."</p><p>With a wink and a smile, she turned and walked off toward the backstage area, the sound of the interviewer’s laughter fading as the buzz of the crowd outside grew louder. It was showtime. And nothing could stop her now.</p><p>As Agatha prepared to step into the spotlight, the excitement of the sold-out Prudential Center filling the air, she couldn’t help but think about how far she’d come—and how much more chaos, fun, and music awaited her on this tour.</p><p>The next morning, as the adrenaline from the previous night’s performance slowly wore off, Agatha sat in the tour bus, scrolling through her phone. As expected, the internet was already buzzing with footage from the show. But one clip, in particular, caught her eye. It was from behind the scenes, just moments before she went on stage.</p><p>The video showed her, hair wild and untamed, strutting through the backstage area, clad in tight black leather and a ripped-up band tee that clung to her frame in all the right places. She was practically radiating confidence (completely fake and put on) moving with a fluidity that almost looked choreographed, like she was born to perform.</p><p>But it was the caption that was blowing up on Twitter: Harkness in her element...sex incarnate.</p><p>Agatha snorted in amusement, scrolling through the endless flood of replies that were thirstier than a desert. The internet had a way of turning everything into a spectacle, and she couldn't help but laugh at how seriously people took her chaotic, off-the-cuff moments.</p><p>Alice had been the one who’d captured the clip. Agatha vaguely remembered the moment—it had been right before they’d gone on stage and Alice had asked her the most random question.</p><p>"Hey, Harkness, what time is it?" Alice had asked, her voice laced with a mix of curiosity and amusement.</p><p>Without missing a beat, Agatha had shot her a smirk, flicking her hair over her shoulder in dramatic fashion. "Time to rock, you dumb slut," she’d replied, with a wink and a playful shove as she brushed past Alice.</p><p>It was classic Harkness: unapologetically blunt, sarcastic, and always ready to turn a simple moment into a meme-worthy line. And now, Twitter was eating it up.</p><p>She couldn’t help but shake her head, amused by the chaos she’d created. The replies were full of laughter and exaggerated praise from fans and strangers alike. Some even made memes, pairing her offbeat "time to rock, you dumb slut" line with all kinds of ridiculous edits.</p><p>The caption, Harkness is the moment. Everyone else is just existing, was shared by a few fan accounts, gaining traction as the hours passed.</p><p>Before she could put her phone down, a message from Rio popped up, flashing on her screen.</p><p>Rio: So, uh, I saw that clip. You’ve got the whole world drooling. Congrats on being the sexiest star alive.</p><p>Agatha laughed, tapping out a quick response.</p><p>Agatha: I didn’t even realise she was recording!</p><p>She paused for a second, then added : You should see the comments. I’m practically a walking fantasy at this point.</p><p>Rio’s reply came almost instantly.</p><p>Rio: I’m more concerned about you walking into trouble, honestly.</p><p>Agatha smirked, knowing exactly what Rio meant. The whole "sex incarnate" thing was a little over-the-top, but it didn’t bother her. She was used to the chaos, to the attention, and to the endless memes. It was part of the package deal when you lived your life so unapologetically. But the fact that Rio was watching, that Rio cared enough to message her, made it all the more fun.</p><p>As Agatha got up and moved toward the door of the bus, she could hear the chatter of her bandmates in the background. Alice, still chuckling at the viral video, was joking about how she might need to start charging for Agatha sex appeal.</p><p>"She can’t help it," Jennifer chimed in from the back. "It’s like a curse, but also a gift."</p><p>Loki, always the one to make a dramatic statement, added, "It’s both- we should bottle that energy and sell it. We'd make millions."</p><p>Agatha laughed, shaking her head. "Alright, alright, enough. I need to go practice not being the center of attention for five minutes."</p><p>Just as she stepped out of the bus, Alice called out to her. "Oh, and Agatha?"</p><p>She turned, raising an eyebrow. "What now?"</p><p>Alice pointed at her phone, showing her the flood of notifications she was getting from fans. "You’re trending again, genius."</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but grin. "Guess I’m doing my job, then."</p><p>And as she walked toward the stage for the second concert, the rest of the band behind her, she knew the night was just beginning. Sure, she was the talk of social media right now—but tonight, it was all about the music. The fans were waiting, and they would get everything Harkness had to give.</p><p>As Agatha stepped closer to the stage, the energy in the arena hit her like a wave, but her phone was still buzzing in her pocket. She quickly silenced it, but curiosity got the best of her. As she waited for the show to begin, she took a moment to scroll through Twitter. It didn’t take long for her to realize that her “time to rock, you dumb slut” moment had gone wild.</p><p>@RockNRollQueen94<br/>Harkness just proved she’s not just a star. She’s a rockstar. ‘Time to rock, you dumb slut.’ I am DECEASED. #Legend</p><p>@Fangirling_24<br/>If Harkness doesn’t start her own meme account, I’ll riot. I just want to live in the world where ‘time to rock, you dumb slut’ is a valid response to ANY question. #AgathaHarkness #Iconic</p><p>@MyHeartLovesHarkness<br/>I’m dying laughing at this clip of Harkness. No one can deliver chaos and sass like she can. 10/10 would watch her ruin lives with sarcasm again. #CanYouMarryMe</p><p>@MetalMaven23<br/>Harkness knows how to break the internet and break hearts. If you haven’t seen the backstage clip, do yourself a favor. ‘Time to rock, you dumb slut’ is literally what dreams are made of. #HarknessIsOnFire</p><p>Agatha chuckled as she read through the messages, the excitement building in her chest. It was all a joke to her—her sarcasm, her wild energy, and the chaos she brought—but the internet had taken it to a new level. Fans were absolutely living for it.</p><p>There were a few that stood out more than the others, though. A message from Rio caught her</p><p>Rio: I’m just over here, pretending to be calm. This clip of you is pure magic. The internet is yours, babe. But please, come home soon so you can call me a dumb slut too 💕</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but smile, her fingers quickly typing out a reply:</p><p>Agatha: When I’m home I’ll make up for it. 😉 But for now, I’ll just keep being a walking meme. ❤️</p><p>She hit send and slipped her phone back into her pocket. The buzz of the crowd reached her ears as she stepped toward the center of the stage, her bandmates ready to rock out with her.</p><p>But for a moment, she couldn’t help but think about Rio. The way her words had made her heart skip a beat, even through a text. It was strange how connected she felt, even from miles away.</p><p>With a grin, she turned toward the crowd. Let’s do this.</p><p>And with that, the show began. The lights blazed, the music kicked in, and Harkness let the energy of the crowd wash over her. But in the back of her mind, there was that quiet excitement for when the tour would finally bring her home.</p><p>As the days passed and the tour progressed, Agatha's connection with Rio only deepened. Every night after the show, once the adrenaline had worn off and she was back on the tour bus or in the hotel rooms, NCIS playing on her tablet, she’d FaceTime Rio. It had become their ritual. It wasn’t just checking in—it was connecting, talking about everything from how the show went to the mundane details of their days. It was the kind of effortless conversation that made Agatha feel like she was home, even when she was halfway across country.</p><p>They’d talk late into the night—sometimes about what was going on with the band, sometimes about silly things like Agatha’s antics on stage or the random memes they’d send each other. Rio would ask about Salem, and Agatha would show her the latest antics of her puppy, who had become the unofficial mascot of the tour.</p><p>The fans were absolutely obsessed with Salem. Agatha had posted a few photos of her cuddling with her during rare moments of downtime, and every picture was met with an overwhelming response. They’d love the candid shots of her in her concert clothes,  holding Salem like a teddy bear, her eyes soft and warm.</p><p>One particular photo—Agatha sprawled out backstage with Salem curled up next to her—had sent fans into a frenzy. The caption read: Salem and I, surviving the chaos one city at a time. 🖤 #TourLife #PuppyLove #SalemTheRockstar.”*</p><p>The comments section was filled with heart emojis and “#CoupleGoals” posts, even though no one really knew if Agatha was dating anyone or not. To the outside world, Agatha was still very much the wild, independent star, with no clear indication of her personal life beyond the occasional photo with her dog and band mates.</p><p>But privately, Rio’s messages, sometimes simple and sweet, were always the highlight of Agatha’s day.</p><p>One night, during a particularly quiet bus ride, Agatha sat by the window with Salem curled in her lap. She FaceTimed Rio again, and this time, Rio’s face looked softer than usual, more relaxed, her hair pulled back into a loose ponytail.</p><p>“Hey, you,” Agatha greeted, smiling as she adjusted the phone to show Salem. “She’s doing alright. A little tired, but she’s good.”</p><p>Rio’s face lit up as soon as she saw the dog. “I swear, that dog is more famous than you are. How’s the tour going?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, scrolling through a few photos on her phone to show Rio some behind-the-scenes shots. “It’s great. Exhausting, but I’m getting used to it. You know how it is—performing every night, trying to keep up with the fans, and the chaos never really stops. But it’s worth it.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, her eyes soft with concern. “You sound tired,” she said gently. “Are you taking care of yourself?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m fine,” Agatha replied, her voice casual, but the concern in Rio’s eyes made her feel a little guilty. “Just… missing home. Missing you, I guess.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flickered with something unreadable, a brief vulnerability. She nodded slowly. “I miss you too. It’s weird, not seeing you in person. But you’re out there doing what you love. And you’ve got Salem with you,” she teased, her tone lighter now, “So you’re never really alone, right?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her heart warming at the thought of Rio. “True. She’s my little tour buddy.”</p><p>The conversation drifted to other topics—funny moments from the road, random thoughts they had. It wasn’t earth-shattering, but it was real, and that felt important.</p><p>Then, Rio paused, looking at Agatha through the screen as if trying to figure something out.</p><p>"Agatha, can I ask you something?" Rio’s voice was soft, tentative.</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha responded, her brow furrowing slightly, sensing the shift in tone.</p><p>Rio hesitated for a moment before speaking. “What happens when the tour ends? What’s next for you? And… for us?”</p><p>The question caught Agatha a little off guard, but it made sense. They had been talking every day, their connection building, and it was only natural to wonder what would happen when the chaos of the tour settled.</p><p>She leaned back in her seat, running a hand through her hair. "Well, the next few months are all about the tour," she said, her voice thoughtful. "But after that... I guess we’ll see." She let out a small laugh, trying to ease the tension. "If you’re asking if I’m planning to just disappear, the answer is no."</p><p>Rio smiled, clearly relieved by the lightness in Agatha’s tone, but there was still something in her eyes that Agatha couldn’t quite place.</p><p>“Well, I hope that’s true,” Rio said quietly, her fingers tracing a pattern on her shirt. “Because this... whatever this is... it feels like it could be something real. But it’s hard, with you being out there and me being here.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat at the sincerity in Rio’s voice. She hadn’t expected this conversation, but hearing Rio’s feelings made her realize just how much she cared.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said softly, her eyes fixed on Rio’s. “I think about that a lot, too. It’s hard, being apart. But we’re figuring it out, right?”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved into a smile, and Agatha couldn’t help but smile back. “Yeah. We are.”</p><p>The conversation drifted into comfortable silence, both of them content in the quiet understanding they’d found in each other’s presence.</p><p>The next stop of the tour was another massive venue, and the energy was electric from the moment Harkness and the band hit the stage. The lights were blinding, the crowd was wild, and the music was pounding through the speakers, vibrating in Agatha’s chest as she gripped the mic stand.</p><p>Halfway through their set, during a particularly intense song, Agatha and Alice found themselves locked in a moment of chaotic, infectious energy. The song’s rhythm demanded movement, and Agatha, always the showwoman, pulled Alice into an impromptu, playful grind, her hips moving in sync with Alice’s. The movements between them was make the crowd electric, the music swirling around them as their bodies pressed together in time with the beat.</p><p>It wasn’t intentional in the sense of publicity or provocation, it was just the raw, magnetic energy of the moment. The music was loud, the crowd was hyped, and Agatha and Alice played up to the crowd. It felt natural, a kind of playful release that only fueled the wildness of the show.</p><p>The fans went absolutely feral. The crowd roared, phones came out, and within seconds, a clip of the moment was all over social media. The video showed Agatha and Alice in the middle of their grind, bodies pressed close together.</p><p>As the video started to spread, the fans went into overdrive. Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok exploded with reactions, memes, and questions. Some were laughing and praising the dance between the two musicians, while others took a much more personal angle.</p><p>@LoudAndProud<br/>I’m not saying anything, but I think Harkness and Alice might be *more* than just bandmates… 👀 #AmITheOnlyOneNoticingThis #AreTheyTogether?</p><p>@HeadbangGoddess<br/>Please tell me I’m not the only one who just saw Harkness and Alice basicallymake out on stage?? I need answers! Is this a thing now? 😵🔥</p><p>@JustForFun123<br/>Okay, but I need confirmation—are Alice and Harkness an item? Or are we just watching them kill it on stage? I have to know. 🤔 #BandmatesOrMore</p><p>The comments only kept coming, and some fans were absolutely convinced that there was more going on between Agatha and Alice than just music. The word sleeping together was everywhere. Fans debated if they were a couple, if it was all for show, or if this was just a new “thing” they were doing to mess with the public.</p><p>Agatha, however, wasn’t paying much attention to the online frenzy. She was caught up in the thrill of the show, the music, and the adrenaline coursing through her veins. It was just another performance, just another night on stage. But the growing buzz online certainly caught her eye when she finally checked her phone during a brief break.</p><p>A notification from Rio popped up first.</p><p>Rio: So, are you and Alice secretly in a relationship or did I just miss the memo? 😂 Because that clip. WOW</p><p>Agatha chuckled to herself as she typed a quick reply:</p><p>Agatha: It’s all part of the chaos 😘</p><p>She hit send, but couldn’t stop smiling. It was funny to her how quickly fans jumped to conclusions, how they saw every little interaction as something deeper than it was. Maybe they were right, maybe they weren’t—but Agatha knew that her connection with Alice was strictly best friends. They were both part of the band, feeding off the energy of the crowd, and the chemistry was just a natural byproduct of their performance.</p><p>But it did make Agatha wonder. If the fans were this interested in every little interaction between her and Alice, how much would they freak out if they knew about her and Rio?</p><p>For now, though, she pushed that thought aside. The show must go on. The next night, as the band prepared for their next performance, Alice leaned over to Agatha, a teasing glint in her eye.</p><p>“You know,” Alice said, glancing at her phone, “the fans are really obsessed with that grind we did last night. Think they’ll ever get over it?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, adjusting her leather jacket as she shrugged. “They’ll get over it when I tell them we’re ‘just bandmates’ and they can all chill.”</p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow. “Bitch, I’m your best friend.”</p><p>They shared a laugh, the kind of easy camaraderie that had fueled their friendship and partnership on stage for years. No matter how wild the fans got, the connection between them remained the same: best friends, professional, playful, and rooted in a shared love of their music.</p><p>But as Agatha glanced back at the growing social media frenzy surrounding their performance, she couldn’t help but feel a little tug in her chest. Maybe she didn’t mind being the center of attention, but there was one person whose opinion mattered more than anyone else’s—Rio.</p><p>For now, she just had to ride the wave of chaos and enjoy the music, the fans, and the thrill of it all.</p><p>As the tour continued, the energy only escalated, and the attention on Agatha and Alice only grew. The clip from the last concert—the one where Agatha and Alice had shared that intense, playful grind—had gone viral. Fans were still buzzing about it, creating memes, fan theories, and wild speculations.</p><p>But there was someone else who had seen all the continued attention, someone who was starting to feel a little uneasy. Rio.</p><p>Agatha had been keeping in touch with Rio through FaceTime calls and texts every night, but the distance was beginning to weigh on both of them. Rio’s messages were starting to sound a little more pointed, a little more curious about Agatha’s dynamic with Alice.</p><p>The next night, as Agatha watched out of the window, a message came through from Rio.</p><p>Rio: I keep seeing the video of you and Alice... maybe you should tell me what’s really going on? 😏</p><p>Agatha’s heart sank a little. She knew Rio wasn’t the jealous type, but seeing her act like this felt different. It was the kind of playful tone that hid an underlying concern.</p><p>She quickly typed out a reply:</p><p>Agatha: Alice and I are were messing around. We’re best friends. We feed off the crowd’s energy, and yeah, sometimes it looks like we’re more than that. But we’re not. You’ve gotta trust me on this one. Alice is actually dating Jennifer.</p><p>She hit send, then leaned back in her seat, her mind racing. She knew Rio wasn’t prone to overreaction, but the thought of her feeling insecure about something so innocent—especially after everything they’d been building—made Agatha feel uneasy. She wanted to reassure Rio, to let her know that there was nothing between her and Alice beyond friendship and a shared passion for the music.</p><p>It wasn’t long before her phone buzzed with a reply.</p><p>Rio:I trust you. Just... I don’t know. You and Alice looked really close. Maybe I’m just overthinking it. But I can’t help how I feel sometimes. Miss you.</p><p>Agatha’s heart softened. She could hear the vulnerability in Rio’s words, even though they were simple and matter-of-fact. Rio wasn’t the type to let her insecurities show, and Agatha felt a pang of guilt for not being there to hold her, to reassure her in person.</p><p>Agatha: I miss you too. And trust me, nothing is happening between me and Alice. She’s with Jennifer. You’ve got nothing to worry about, I promise. I’ll make it up to you when I get home. But for now, you’re the only one I’m thinking about. I promise.”*</p><p>She sent the message and waited, her stomach in knots. Rio was quiet for a while, and Agatha started to wonder if she’d gotten it wrong—if maybe she hadn’t communicated well enough, after all they’d still not labeled what they were. But then Rio’s message popped up.</p><p>Rio: Okay. I get it. I guess I’m a little jealous. But I’m glad you told me. I’ll try to stop overthinking.</p><p>Agatha let out a relieved breath, her heart warming. She knew Rio was the kind of person who needed open, honest communication, and Agatha had just made a mental note to keep it that way.</p><p>Agatha: Maybe when I get back, you can meet Jennifer and Alice. You’d love them. They’re both pretty great, and you’ll see that it’s just a friendship thing. Nothing else.</p><p>Rio: Alright. I’ll hold you to that. But don’t get any ideas while you’re out there. I know how wild the rockstar life can get.</p><p>Agatha smiled at Rio’s message. It was the kind of playful banter that she had come to adore. It made her feel wanted, and even more, it made her feel grounded. Rio wasn’t asking her to stop living her life; she just needed to know that Agatha was invested in her. And Agatha didn’t mind that one bit.</p><p>Agatha: I’ll be back before you know it, babe. And when I am, I’m all yours.</p><p>She sent the message and felt the weight of the situation lift off her shoulders. She was glad Rio had opened up about her feelings. It made Agatha even more certain that what she and Rio were building something worth fighting for.</p><p>And when she got back home, she was going to make sure Rio knew that she was the one Agatha was coming back to.</p><p>But for now, the tour had to go on. The music had to keep playing, the fans had to keep screaming, and Agatha had to keep being Harkness, the pop star.</p><p>But in the back of her mind, Rio’s words were always there, and Agatha smiled, knowing that soon, she’d be back in her arms.</p><p>The next night, as the band geared up for their next show, Alice gave Agatha a teasing grin when Agatha assured her she’d be keeping her hands to herself.</p>

<p>As the tour entered its fourth week, Agatha found herself in a rhythm she didn’t expect. The loud crowds, the endless travel, the constant buzz of the music world—it had all become part of the background. What stood out now, more than ever, was the steady pull of Rio’s presence in her life.</p><p>Every night, after the show, Agatha would find herself winding down with a call to Rio. They would talk for hours—sometimes about the mundane, sometimes about deeper, more vulnerable things. It was the first time that Agatha felt this kind of connection with someone, this kind of closeness that wasn’t defined by the lights, the music, or the fans.</p><p>And as the days stretched on, Agatha realized that the bond between her and Rio was something she didn’t want to lose, something she was ready to acknowledge in a way she hadn’t fully done before.</p><p>It was late one night, after a particularly high-energy show, that Agatha found herself sitting in the tour bus, tucked into her bunk with her phone in hand. She’d just finished texting Rio that she was done for the night, and the moment the video call came through, Agatha’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>The screen lit up with Rio’s familiar smile, her face glowing in the dim light of her apartment.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said softly, her voice warm and comforting. “How was the show tonight?”</p><p>Agatha leaned back, propping herself up with one arm, her free hand absentmindedly playing with a strand of her hair. “Insane,” she replied, a grin tugging at her lips. “The crowd was wild.”</p><p>Rio’s smile softened, and she nodded, her eyes a little more serious than usual. “I miss you. A lot. It’s like... it’s hard to describe, but there’s this empty space while I’m waiting for our calls. Like the days feel longer, you know?”</p><p>Agatha felt a warm flutter in her chest, a feeling she hadn’t expected to be so intense. She wasn’t just missing Rio in the sense of missing someone she liked—she was realizing that she missed her in a way that was deeper, more permanent. It was becoming clear to her that this wasn’t just some fleeting romance.</p><p>She met Rio’s gaze through the screen, her heart beating just a little faster. “Yeah, I know exactly what you mean,” Agatha replied, her voice lower than usual, as if the gravity of the moment was settling in. “It’s been crazy being out here, but... every night, when I’m off stage and I finally have a second to breathe, I just want to call you. Hear your voice. Talk to you.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted slightly, as if she were about to say something, but then she hesitated. She seemed to be gathering her thoughts, her fingers tapping absentmindedly on the surface of her phone.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio began softly, her voice suddenly quieter. “I’ve been thinking a lot about us. About you. About everything we’ve been talking about these past few weeks. I don’t know what this is exactly, but... I know I want it to be more.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse quickened, her mind racing as she processed the weight of Rio’s words. She hadn’t expected this conversation tonight. And yet, in a way, she had. She had felt it coming, the way Rio’s words and gestures had grown more intimate, more meaningful with every passing day. This was a natural next step.</p><p>“More?” Agatha echoed, her voice a little breathless. “You mean...?”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, her gaze unwavering. “I mean... I want to be with you. Not just as someone Im sort of dating and talk to every day, not just as someone I miss when you’re not around, but as more than that. I want you to be mine. I want to be yours. I want to be your girlfriend, Agatha.”</p><p>For a moment, the words hung between them, suspended in the space of their shared connection. Agatha’s heart swelled, her lips curving into a smile that felt like the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>“You’re asking me to be your girlfriend?” Agatha repeated, her voice a little teasing, but the affection in it was undeniable.</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed slightly, but she smiled, clearly nervous but also excited. “Yeah. I know it’s a bit strange with us being apart. I know we’re still figuring things out, but I don’t want to wait anymore. I’ve never felt this way before, and I just... I want to make it official, you know?”</p><p>Agatha sat up straighter in her bunk, the bus rocking slightly as it continued its long journey to the next city. Her fingers twitched with excitement, and she couldn’t help but feel the wide smile spreading across her face. She had been waiting for this, wanting it, but hearing Rio say it out loud made it feel so much more real.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said softly, her eyes warm with affection, “I’ve wanted that too. I just didn’t know how to say it first.” She laughed lightly, her voice filled with emotion. “I’m yours. And you’re mine. Officially.”</p><p>Rio let out a breath of relief, and her smile lit up the screen. “I’ve been waiting for you to say that,” she said with a laugh. “It feels like a weight’s been lifted off my shoulders.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, feeling the same weightlessness. “Yeah, me too.”</p><p>They both sat there for a moment, just smiling at each other through the screen, the distance between them feeling smaller than it had in weeks. They didn’t need words to know what they had just done. It was more than a label—it was a promise, a commitment to something real.</p><p>“I guess I’m officially your girlfriend?” Agatha said with a playful grin, breaking the silence.</p><p>Rio’s eyes sparkled, her smile widening. “Yep.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat as she looked at Rio, the woman who had come into her life so unexpectedly, but now, she couldn’t imagine it any other way. The tour, the fans, the chaos of her life—it all felt secondary to this moment, to the connection she had with Rio.</p><p>“I’ll make sure to show you how much that means when I get back,” Agatha murmured, her voice low and teasing.</p><p>Rio’s laughter echoed through the phone, light and full of promise. “I’m counting on it.”</p><p>The conversation between Agatha and Rio had a gentle energy, like the calm after a storm. But as the excitement of their newfound commitment settled, Rio’s expression shifted slightly. She bit her lip, looking down for a moment, as though she was weighing her words carefully.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio began softly, her tone a little more hesitant than before. “There’s something I need to tell you.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile faltered for a second, sensing the shift. She leaned forward, her face softening with concern. “What’s up? You know you can tell me anything.”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, clearly gathering her thoughts. “I’m really happy we’re doing this, you know? Being together. But—” she paused, her gaze shifting as she spoke, “but I think I need some time before I’m ready for the world to know about us. I don’t want to deal with the fans or the media right now.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed slightly, the shift in tone not lost on her. She leaned back a little, processing Rio’s words.</p><p>“I get it,” Agatha said slowly, her voice gentle and understanding. “You’re not ready for the spotlight. It’s a lot, especially when you don’t have control over it. It’s not easy.”</p><p>Rio nodded, a quiet relief in her eyes. “Exactly. I don’t want to hide from you, Agatha. I just need to figure out how to balance this with everything else. I’m not sure how I’d deal with the attention right now.”</p><p>Agatha could feel the weight of Rio’s vulnerability in her words. It wasn’t easy for someone to admit that kind of uncertainty, especially when it came to something as public as a relationship with Agatha. She was well aware of the chaos that often surrounded her, and she respected Rio’s decision more than she could put into words.</p><p>“You don’t have to explain,” Agatha said softly. “I understand. You don’t owe anyone anything. Not me, not my fans, not anyone.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, and she gave a small, grateful smile. “Thank you. I just... I need this to be ours for now. To figure it out in our own time. I don’t want to rush into anything with all the noise and the pressure.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her heart swelling with warmth for Rio. The fact that she was willing to open up about her feelings like this meant everything to Agatha. She had never been in a romantic situation where both parties were so honest, so willing to communicate their boundaries.</p><p>“I respect that,” Agatha said firmly. “We’ll keep this between us. Just us. You don’t have to worry about anything else.”</p><p>Rio looked relieved, her shoulders relaxing as if a weight had been lifted. “I know this might sound crazy, but I feel like we’re doing this the right way. Just... slow. And private. And real.”</p><p>“Real,” Agatha repeated, her voice soft and steady. “That’s what matters. We’ll take it one step at a time, Rio. I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>There was a brief silence, the kind that felt more comfortable than awkward, before Rio spoke again, her voice quieter but full of sincerity. “I just want to be able to enjoy this without the pressure. I want to be with you, Agatha, without everyone else weighing in on it.”</p><p>Agatha smiled warmly, her heart full. “You’ve got it. Whatever you need. Whenever you’re ready to make it public, that’s on you. I’m not rushing you.”</p><p>Rio smiled back, a small but genuine expression of gratitude. “Thank you. That means a lot to me.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers lightly traced the edge of her bunk, as she gazed into the camera, meeting Rio’s eyes. “This is about us, Rio. It doesn’t matter how fast or slow we go. I’m here for the ride.”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened, her eyes sparkling. “I’m glad. I’m really glad.”</p><p>And just like that, the conversation slipped back into its usual easy flow. The pressure of making things official in the eyes of the world had lifted, and now, all that mattered was what they were building together. The connection. The trust. The quiet understanding that was growing between them every day.</p><p>Agatha knew that things would be complicated when the time came for the public to know, but for now, she was content. She could feel Rio’s warmth through the screen, and she was sure of one thing: when the time was right, they’d be ready to face whatever came next, together.</p><p>The next day, as Agatha stepped into the hotel suite after soundcheck, she was greeted by the soft scent of flowers filling the room. A large bouquet sat on the table, a mix of roses and lilies in soft shades of pink and white, tied together with a delicate ribbon. A small card peeked out from underneath the blooms, and Agatha couldn't help but smile when she read it.</p><p>The note simply said, Thinking of you. -R</p><p>Her heart fluttered, a warmth spreading through her chest. Rio had sent flowers. It was simple, thoughtful, and undeniably sweet. Agatha felt a rush of affection for the woman who had managed to keep her grounded through the chaos of the tour, and a part of her wanted to share that with the world—well, with her fans, at least.</p><p>Without a second thought, Agatha grabbed her phone and snapped a picture of the bouquet. The soft petals glowed against the warm light of the suite, and she added a touch of her signature style to the post.</p><p>She typed out the caption: Just a little something thats brightened the day 💐 🔒”and hit post, following it with a padlock emoji to match the sentiment. It was subtle, almost like a hint, but it was enough for those who knew her well to get the message.</p><p>It didn’t take long for her fans to notice.</p><p>@rockfan123: Who’s the secret admirer, Harkness? We’re all dying to know!!! 🔒💐</p><p>@itsmesarah: OMG I NEED TO KNOW WHO’S SENDING HER FLOWERS 😩 This is so cute!</p><p>@jenna_the_queen: I hope this is her official girlfriend announcement, we need to know who’s making her so happy! 😍</p><p>*l@lexi_bass: That padlock emoji... 👀 Is Harkness hiding a girlfriend?!”*</p><p>The comments kept pouring in, full of speculation and excitement, with fans trying to piece together the mystery. Some were asking if she was dating anyone, others were just outright guessing who it could be, but all of them were invested in whatever secret was unfolding.</p><p>Agatha smiled as she read through the responses. It was amusing to see how her fans were piecing together little clues, though the truth was, she wouldnt break Rios trust and reveal it all just yet. It was comforting, in a way, to know that people cared so much about her happiness, even if they didn’t know the whole story.</p><p>The post continued to gather comments, fans flooding her with love and questions, and Agatha couldn’t help but feel a little lighter. The flowers, the note, and the mysterious post—everything felt like it was part of a new chapter in her life. One where she was more than just Harkness, more than the wild chaos gremlin. She was Agatha, too. And for the first time in a while, she felt like she had something real to hold onto.</p><p>As the post gained momentum, Agatha’s mind wandered back to Rio. She imagined her smile, the softness of her voice, the way she always made her feel like everything would be okay. For now, they were keeping it private, but Agatha was okay with that. Their connection felt too important to rush into the spotlight.</p><p>For now, all Agatha had to do was enjoy the flowers, the secrecy, and the quiet moments they shared, no matter how small.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>After yet another show, the band—Alice, Jennifer, Loki, and Agatha—decided to unwind and celebrate a successful night in Wisconsin. They found a local bar nearby, a cozy spot with neon lights and the hum of chatter, and settled into a booth near the back. The excitement from the concert still buzzed in the air, but it felt like the perfect time to relax and have fun together.</p><p>“Tonight was insane,” Jennifer said, grinning as she slid into the booth, settling beside Agatha. “We’re on fire, guys.”</p><p>Loki, ever the prankster, raised his glass. “To the best damn band on the planet,” he toasted, and everyone cheered, clinking glasses together.</p><p>As the drinks kept flowing and the conversation turned to everything from tour stories to the band’s personal lives, the energy in the booth remained high. Agatha, who was usually a little reserved after shows, found herself letting go, her laughter mixing with the others. There was a sense of freedom in this moment, one that didn’t require any pressure or performance.</p><p>Alice, sitting across from Agatha, nudged her playfully. “You know, I think it’s time for a round of shots,” she declared, already flagging the waitress.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, smirking. “Shots? You’re that kind of band now?”</p><p>Loki snickered. “Oh, we’re always that kind of band. You just don’t always see it.”</p><p>When the shots arrived, the group raised them high, all smiles and laughter. Agatha could feel the heat of the alcohol, but more than that, she could feel the camaraderie, the bond between them all, growing stronger with every moment.</p><p>But as they threw back the shots and the music played, the excitement began spilling into the rest of the bar. Some fans, who had followed the band after the show, were snapping pictures from the edges of the crowd. It didn’t take long for those pictures to start popping up on social media.</p><p>@rockfan123: I just saw Harkness and the whole band out at a bar!! They’re so normal but also so cool at the same time 😎💯</p><p>@HarkyGirl: Did Harkness just take a shot? I’m crying 😂 #RockstarVibes #I’mNotWorthy”</p><p>@official_alice_heart: When Alice gets in the zone... she’s got the moves! 🕺 #BandGoals #DancingWithTheStars</p><p>A few fans shared blurry photos of Alice and Agatha dancing, their wild energy visible even through the hazy lighting. There was another shot of Loki pulling Jennifer into an impromptu dance-off, with Agatha and Alice watching from the sidelines, laughing and clinking glasses.</p><p>One particularly popular tweet had everyone buzzing:</p><p>@lovesickrocker: Is Harkness actually having fun instead of just pretending for the fans? Notice how the vids tonight shes not playing with her rings?🧐 Either way, the vibe is giving ‘I’m not a pop star, I’m your best friend’ energy tonight. #MoreThanAStagePersona</p><p>The tweet got thousands of likes and retweets, with fans commenting on how down-to-earth and approachable Agatha seemed despite her rockstar status. Agatha couldn’t help but chuckle when she saw it, the lighthearted energy of the night making her feel even more at ease.</p><p>As the night wore on, the group continued to revel in their success, the music thumping around them. Agatha found herself pulled into another round of dancing, all of them laughing at how ridiculous their moves had become. Jennifer and Loki kept things lighthearted, teasing each other over who was the better dancer (it was clearly Loki, but no one was going to admit that).</p><p>Despite the chaos of their social media posts, Agatha felt centered in the midst of it all. She wasn’t trying to impress anyone—she was simply living in the moment, enjoying the freedom of being herself without any masks.</p><p>And as the night came to an end, they all piled into a ride back to the hotel. The familiar banter and laughter filled the air, with fans still hovering outside the venue, trying to catch a glimpse of their idols. Agatha didn’t mind it.</p><p>In the back of the car, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Rio:</p><p>Rio: You seem to be having fun tonight 😊 I’m happy you’re enjoying yourself, don’t worry about ringing me if your in too late me. I miss you ❤️</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat. She couldn’t help but smile at the text, the soft reminder of Rio’s presence even while she was miles away.</p><p>She quickly typed back:</p><p>Agatha: I’m definitely thinking of you. Can’t wait to see you soon. ❤️</p><p>And for a moment, as she tucked her phone away, Agatha felt like everything was aligning in the most unexpected way. The chaos of the night, the fans, the fun... it was all just part of the ride. But what really mattered was the connection she had with Rio. That was the constant, the anchor in the midst of it all.</p><p>Tomorrow would come with more shows, more energy, and more moments to capture. But for tonight, Agatha was content.</p><p>The fans were wild tonight, more energetic than usual. Agatha was used to the attention—her fame had grown exponentially over the past few months—but tonight, the crowd outside the venue seemed particularly enthusiastic. As she moved through the throng, signing posters and taking pictures with the fans, things quickly took a turn.</p><p>A couple of women approached her, laughing as they held up their shirts, revealing their bare midriffs and chest areas. "Harkness, sign here!" one of them shouted, pointing to her cleavage.</p><p>Agatha paused, a little surprised but amused. “You guys really can’t wait, huh?” she said, laughing. The fans around her cheered, clearly thrilled by her willingness to engage. She signed a few quick autographs and then, with a dramatic sigh, took the sharpie and leaned forward to sign the spot they'd requested, still laughing. “Alright, alright, but don’t make this a habit,” she teased, her grin wide as she scribbled her name.</p><p>The crowd responded with laughter and hoots, and Agatha quickly moved to sign another fan’s poster, trying to keep things light.</p><p>As the band made their way into the hotel, Agatha found herself looking forward to hearing from Rio. It was these little moments—away from the chaos—that helped ground her. And tonight, more than ever, she needed that.</p><p>The night had already been chaotic, but things took a sharp turn when the fan reached forward and grabbed Agatha's arm with far more force than she was prepared for. One second, she was signing a final poster, laughing and making small talk with the crowd, and the next, she was being yanked backward. The pull was harsh, and before she could react, her feet stumbled, the ground tilting beneath her as she fell back onto the hard pavement.</p><p>Everything happened so quickly that Agatha barely had time to process what was happening. She hit the ground with a jarring thud, her elbow taking most of the impact. Her sharp breath caught in her throat, the sudden shock sending a wave of dizziness through her.</p><p>"Shit!" Alice’s voice rang out, panicked, as she immediately rushed toward her.</p><p>Agatha lay on the pavement for a moment, dazed, her heart hammering in her chest. The fan who had grabbed her looked mortified, but Agatha barely noticed them in that moment, her mind spinning.</p><p>“Agatha! Are you okay?!” Alice’s frantic voice cut through the fog in her mind, and Agatha blinked, trying to focus on her bandmate. She could hear the rustle of people around her, the growing concern from the crowd and her security.</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, one of the security guards was at her side, helping her up. But as she did, the dizziness worsened, and a wave of nausea followed it. The once vibrant energy of the crowd had started to feel suffocating, the noise growing louder in her ears as her heart raced uncontrollably.</p><p>"Can you stand? Are you okay?" the guard asked, his voice firm but gentle.</p><p>Agatha nodded, but the effort felt like it took everything out of her. “I’m fine,” she managed to say, even though she didn’t feel fine at all.</p><p>The adrenaline and shock from the fall had left her shaky, her palms clammy. The dizziness, the rush of panic—it was all too much. Agatha’s breath started coming faster and faster, a familiar tightness closing in around her chest. The edges of her vision blurred. She felt the world closing in on her.</p><p>“Alice…” Agatha’s voice was quiet, weak. “I... I need to—”</p><p>Alice was already helping, steadying her, but Agatha felt the walls around her start to close in. The crowd, the flashing lights, the constant attention—it was all too much.</p><p>Security ushered the fans back as they hurried Agatha through the hotel doors, trying to shield her from further attention. As soon as she crossed the threshold, the air felt slightly cooler, the noise muffled, but it did nothing to ease the overwhelming feeling in her chest. Her heartbeat pounded in her ears.</p><p>Inside, the group rushed toward the elevators, but Agatha felt the panic rising in her chest with each step. She could feel her hands trembling, her breath shallow, her chest tightening, as if the weight of the entire world had suddenly settled on her.</p><p>"Agatha," Alice said softly, her voice worried. "Are you sure you're okay? Do you need a minute?"</p><p>But Agatha couldn’t respond. She couldn’t speak. She could barely think. All she could feel was the terrifying pressure building inside her chest, choking her breath.</p><p>As they entered the elevator, Agatha pressed her back against the wall, fighting the urge to collapse. She could feel the walls closing in, her mind racing. The room was spinning, and she was desperately trying to regain control of her breathing.</p><p>The elevator doors opened on their reserved floor, and Alice quickly guided her to their hotel suite. Once inside, Agatha staggered over to the couch, sinking into it, her hands clutching the fabric of her jeans as she tried to steady herself.</p><p>“I just—” Agatha gasped, her breaths coming in quick, shallow bursts. "I can’t... breathe..."</p><p>“Hey, hey,” Alice said, crouching down in front of her. “Look at me. It’s okay. You’re okay.”</p><p>But Agatha couldn’t focus on her. She could barely focus on anything. Her chest felt tight, and the room was starting to spin faster.</p><p>"Deep breaths, Agatha. In, out. Come on." Alice’s voice was calm, soothing, but Agatha could barely hear her through the haze of panic. “I know this isn’t easy, but just breathe, okay? One step at a time.”</p><p>Agatha tried to focus on Alice’s voice, tried to follow her instructions. But every time she inhaled, it felt like there wasn’t enough air, like she was suffocating from the inside.</p><p>The panic attack, an enemy from her childhood, was slowly consuming her, and all she could do was try to ride it out. As Agatha's breathing continued to shallow and her body trembled from the panic attack, Alice stayed by her side, doing her best to keep her calm. But Agatha was far beyond words right now. She had closed herself off, staring into space as if trying to escape the feeling gripping her chest.</p><p>Alice knew that Agatha’s mom, Lilia, was the one who could help—she always knew how to talk Agatha down when things got overwhelming. Alice pulled out her phone, her fingers trembling just a little as she dialed Lilia’s number.</p><p>The phone rang a few times before Lilia’s voice came through, steady but tinged with concern.</p><p>“Alice? What’s going on? Is Agatha alright?”</p><p>“Aunt Lilia, it’s Agatha. She… she’s having a panic attack. A fan grabbed her arm, knocked her down and it kind of freaked her out. I’ve been trying to calm her down, but it’s bad, and I don’t know what else to do.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice softened immediately, and Agatha could hear the change even through the phone. “I’m so sorry to hear that. Listen, I can’t be there in person, but I can help. Just put me on speakerphone, alright?”</p><p>“Got it,” Alice said, pressing the speakerphone icon. She moved the phone closer to Agatha, who had her arms wrapped around her knees, her face pale and strained. “She’s not really talking, but she can hear you.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice filled the room then, calm and warm. “Agatha, sweetheart, it’s mom. I know you’re feeling like everything’s crashing down, but I need you to take a deep breath for me. In through your nose, slow and steady. And out through your mouth. Can you do that for me?”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders stiffened at the sound of her mom’s voice, and for a long moment, it seemed like she wasn’t going to respond. But then, slowly, she let out a shaky breath, her hands still trembling.</p><p>“Good. That’s it. Just take your time,” Lilia continued, her voice soothing but firm. “You’re safe, sweetheart. There’s nothing here that you can’t handle. I know it feels like the world is spinning, but you’re in control. You’ve been through this before, and you’ll get through it again. Just breathe, okay? You don’t have to fix anything right now.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, her breaths coming faster again, but she was listening. Alice could see the way Agatha’s body was starting to relax just a little. Lilia’s voice had a way of doing that—pulling Agatha back when she felt like she was losing herself.</p><p>“You don’t have to explain anything, Agatha,” Lilia continued. “You’re allowed to feel however you’re feeling right now. But know that you’re not alone, and I’m here. We’re all here. Alice is there with you. And I’m just a phone call away. You don’t have to go through this by yourself, okay?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, her voice barely a whisper. “I don’t know what happened... I—I felt like I couldn’t breathe, like everything was too much.”</p><p>“You’ve been through a lot of shit, honey,” Lilia said, her tone gentle, like a balm over the rawness of Agatha’s feelings. “And sometimes, when it all builds up, it can hit you like this. But that doesn’t mean you’re weak, or that you’re failing. It just means that your body and mind are telling you they need a break. You can take that break. We’re not going anywhere. We’re right here.”</p><p>Agatha sniffled, and Alice could see her shoulders relax ever so slightly. She wasn’t fully calm yet, but hearing her mom’s voice—hearing those familiar, grounding words—was like a lifeline.</p><p>“Just breathe with me, sweetheart. In through your nose, slow and steady... and out through your mouth. We’re going to take it slow, one breath at a time.”</p><p>Agatha followed the rhythm of Lilia’s breathing instructions, and after a few more minutes, she was able to get her breathing under control. Her body wasn’t shaking as much, though the vulnerability of it all was still there, just beneath the surface.</p><p>“Better?” Lilia asked softly.</p><p>Agatha nodded, though her eyes remained closed. “Yeah... I think so. I just feel... stupid. I should’ve been able to handle it.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice was full of warmth, but also stern in that motherly way that only Lilia had. “Don’t you dare apologize, Agatha. You didn’t do anything wrong. You’re human, sweetheart. Everyone has their breaking point. And you’re allowed to have moments where you don’t feel strong, even if you usually are. We’re not meant to carry the world on our shoulders all the time. That’s what people are here for. To help you when you need it.”</p><p>“I feel... so messed up,” Agatha whispered, her voice trembling.</p><p>“No, baby,” Lilia replied gently. “You’re not messed up. You’re my strong, beautiful daughter. You’re allowed to be vulnerable. And you’re allowed to ask for help when you need it. And you did. You let Alice help, and now I’m here. You’re not broken. You’re human. And I love you. Always.”</p><p>Agatha stayed silent for a moment, and when she finally opened her eyes, there were fresh tears but also a sense of relief. She reached up to wipe her eyes, a shaky breath escaping her lips. “Thanks, Mom.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice was full of love and understanding. “You’re welcome, sweetheart. Just remember, you’re never alone. No matter what happens, you’ve got me. And you’ve got Alice, and you’ve got Rio, the people who care about you.”</p><p>Alice, still sitting beside Agatha, gave her a small smile, glad to see her calming down, even if only a little.</p><p>“Alright, sweetie,” Lilia said, her tone lighter now. “I need you to take care of yourself. Get some rest. We’re not in a rush. One moment at a time. You can do this.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, her chest no longer feeling as tight. “Okay... I think I’ll try to get some sleep. I’ll... I’ll call you in the morning.”</p><p>“You better,” Lilia replied with a warm chuckle. “Take care of yourself. I love you, Agatha.”</p><p>“I love you too, Mom.”</p><p>The call ended, and for the first time since the panic attack, Agatha felt a sense of calm wash over her. She wasn’t fully okay, but she could breathe again. She could think again.</p><p>Her phone buzzed in her pocket. Alice glanced at her phone, and Agatha’s heart skipped when she saw the message on the screen.</p><p>It was from Rio.</p><p>Rio: Hey, are you alright? I saw what happened with the fans. I’m really worried. Please call me when you can. I miss you.</p><p>It was like a lifeline. The thought of hearing Rio’s voice was enough to snap Agatha further into the present, even if just for a moment.</p><p>Alice gently helped Agatha lie back on the sofa, her eyes full of concern. “Do you want to talk to her? I’ll be right here with you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, managing a shaky smile. She couldn’t talk properly, not yet, but she could hear Rio’s voice, and that was enough. It was just what she needed.</p><p>With trembling hands, Agatha dialed Rio's number, and as the call connected, she leaned her head back, trying to slow her racing heart. She closed her eyes, feeling a little more anchored by the thought of Rio waiting on the other end of the line.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice was soft but urgent, filled with concern. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha finally let out a shaky breath as she listened to Rio’s familiar, calming tone. “I will be,” she whispered. “Just needed to hear you, that’s all.”</p><p>Alice gave her a small, reassuring smile once the call to her girlfriend had ended, offering her a glass of water. "Better?"</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, taking the water. “Yeah. Thanks for calling my mom.”</p><p>"Anytime," Alice replied. "Now, let's get you some rest. We’ve got a big day tomorrow."</p><p>Agatha smiled weakly, feeling the tightness in her chest loosen, knowing that despite the chaos around her, she wasn’t facing this alone.</p><p>The footage of the incident, where the fan grabs Agatha’s arm too forcefully, causing her to stumble and fall, quickly spread across social media. Fans flooded platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok with clips, screenshots, and memes, all sharing the moment from different angles.</p><p>On Twitter, the reactions were fast and furious.</p><p>@FanGirl20: This is why fans need to respect boundaries. Harkness shouldn’t have been grabbed like that. She’s a human being, not an object to pull around.</p><p>@RockstarFan4Life: WTF? That fan should be arrested for that. No one should ever touch her like that. 😡 #RespectHarkness</p><p>@LokiRocks: My heart dropped when I saw this. The way she stumbled? That was not okay. Hope she’s okay, Harkness is a queen. 💔 #TeamHarkness</p><p>Meanwhile, on Instagram, fans started sharing their own versions of the clip, tagging the band and using a growing set of hashtags like #ProtectAgatha, #RespectHerBoundaries, and #NoMoreGrabs. Some posted supportive comments, while others pointed out that this wasn’t an isolated incident. The more the footage spread, the more the conversation turned from concern about Agatha’s wellbeing to frustration over the lack of respect shown by certain fans.</p><p>@DaniTheFan: This is NOT okay. Harkness deserves so much better. Fans, please remember she’s a person too. 🙏 #RespectAgatha #Harkness</p><p>Others went a step further, pushing back against the idea that the situation was just a minor incident or an overreaction.</p><p>@HarknessIsMyQueen: Anyone who thinks this is no big deal clearly doesn’t understand personal boundaries or respect. That fan is in the wrong and it’s heartbreaking to see Harkness deal with this. #TakeAction</p><p>One viral video clip showed Agatha’s fall, and the caption read, Agatha Harkness didn’t deserve this. The video got millions of views, sparking a deeper conversation in the comments about how fans need to act responsibly, especially when interacting with public figures.</p><p>On TikTok, creators began stitching together the video with their own commentary, some expressing anger, others showing support.</p><p>One fan, @AngelOfTheStage?posted a heartfelt message: Harkness, you’re loved. You don’t need to be grabbed or pulled by anyone. You’re a rockstar, not a doll to play with. Hope you’re doing okay. #Harknessisloved</p><p>Even members of the music community weighed in with their own experiences.</p><p>Despite the overwhelming support, there were also some who made light of the situation, commenting sarcastic remarks or joking about how “dramatic” things were getting. But the majority of responses were loud and clear: they had Agatha’s back, and no one was going to stand by while she was mistreated.</p><p>Alice and Jennifer, who had been right there with Agatha during the incident, were both upset by the way the situation was playing out online, knowing that it was increasing Agathas anxiety, though they knew it wasn’t something they could easily control.</p><p>As the day went on, Agatha's manager issued a statement in support of Agatha, thanking fans for their concern and reminding everyone to respect boundaries. The statement read:</p><p>"We appreciate the love and concern for Harkness following the recent incident. She’s doing well, and we’re grateful for the fans who continue to support her in the way she deserves. Please remember that personal space and respect are crucial. The safety and wellbeing of our artists and fans is our top priority. Let’s keep the love positive and respectful. Thank you."</p><p>While the statement helped clear up some misunderstandings, the buzz on social media didn’t die down. Fans continued to share their thoughts, but most of them reiterated their commitment to supporting Agatha, hoping she’d feel the love after such an overwhelming experience.</p><p>That day, Agatha stayed in the hotel suite, cuddling Salem and in facetime with Rio, blocking out the world.</p>

<p>Agatha shifted her weight from foot to foot, barely able to contain the nervous excitement bubbling in her chest. Week five of the tour meant they were finally in California,close to her hometown, and more importantly, it meant she would finally see Rio. The venue loomed ahead, glowing in the early evening light, announcing her name in bold, golden letters. She still wasn’t used to that—the way her name shone so brightly, the way the crowds buzzed with anticipation before every show. But tonight, the excitement wasn’t just about the performance.</p><p>She’d sent a box of merch a week ago, slipping in a few of the limited edition hoodies and vinyl pressings of the album. But most importantly, she had tucked two VIP tickets on top, written Rio’s name on the envelope in thick black marker, along with a note that read I can’t wait to finally kiss you again.</p><p>Her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out with slightly shaky fingers.</p><p>Rio: We’re here!!! Can’t wait to see you crush it, baby</p><p>Agatha grinned and quickly typed back.</p><p>Agatha: Backstage after 😘😘😘</p><p>She shoved her phone away before she could get lost in the conversation. There was still soundcheck, and then the pre-show rituals with the band. But knowing Rio was out there with her mom, waiting for her, made everything feel even more electric.</p><p>“Ready?” Jennifer asked as she nudged her as they walked toward the stage for soundcheck.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, steadying herself. “More than ever.”</p><p>The show flew by in a blur of bright lights, roaring applause, and the rush of adrenaline that came with every note she belted out. But even as she soaked in the energy of the crowd, her eyes kept searching for Rio. And then, near the end of the set, she spotted her—front row of the VIP area, wearing the hoodie Agatha had sent, her dark hair wild, her eyes shining. Their gazes met, and Rio blew her a kiss.</p><p>Agatha nearly missed her cue.</p><p>By the time the encore ended and she practically sprinted off stage, her heart was hammering.</p><p>Rio was escorted backstage by security, and as soon as she walked into the room, Agatha's eyes lit up. The sight of her was like a balm, soothing all the chaos and exhaustion that had been building up over the past few weeks. Agatha didn’t even hesitate—she crossed the room quickly, her arms wide open.</p><p>Rio grinned and met her halfway, immediately pulling her into a tight embrace. Agatha held her for a moment longer than necessary, savoring the warmth of her body. "I missed you," Agatha whispered, her voice soft but full of longing.</p><p>"I missed you too," Rio murmured, pulling back just enough to look into Agatha’s eyes. She smiled before leaning in and kissing her softly, the kiss warm and tender after the long separation.</p><p>Just as Agatha was starting to melt into the kiss, she heard a familiar, excited bark. Agatha broke away from Rio and turned, her heart lifting as Salem trotted into the room, wagging her tail enthusiastically. The little puppy had clearly been waiting to see Rio, Agatha bent down to scoop her into her arms.</p><p>With a breathless laugh, she tightened her grip on Rio and tackled her onto the worn-out couch in the backstage lounge. They landed in a tangle of limbs, Rio gasping in surprise as Salem jumped on her, before bursting into laughter.</p><p>“You’re insane,” Rio breathed, her hands instinctively finding Agatha’s waist.</p><p>“And you love it,” Agatha shot back, grinning as she hovered above her, drinking in every detail—the way Rio’s hair framed her face, the way her lips parted just slightly, inviting her closer.</p><p>Rio didn’t argue. Instead, she cupped the back of Agatha’s neck and pulled her down into a kiss that sent a rush of heat through her body. Agatha melted into it, her fingers tangling in Rio’s hair as their lips moved together, hungry and desperate. Five weeks apart had been torture, and now, finally, she could feel her, taste her, breathe her in.</p><p>Rio sighed into the kiss, her nails grazing lightly down Agatha’s back, making her shiver. “You have no idea how much I’ve missed this.”</p><p>Agatha pressed a lingering kiss to her jaw before whispering against her skin, “Pretty sure I do.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, her fingers tracing lazy circles on Agatha’s hip. “You were incredible out there.”</p><p>Agatha pulled back just enough to look into her eyes. “You being here made it better.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened, her thumb brushing against Agatha’s cheek. “I’m so proud of you.”</p><p>Agatha felt something tighten in her chest, a mix of affection and relief that Rio was finally here, real and solid in her arms. She leaned in for another kiss, slow and deep, savoring every second.</p><p>The sound of the room door creaking open made them jolt apart.</p><p>“Yo, Agatha, we’re doing drinks at—” Alice’s voice cut off mid-sentence. A beat of silence. Then—</p><p>“Oh. Ohhh. My bad.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, dropping her forehead against Rio’s shoulder as Alice cackled.</p><p>“Carry on,” Alice called over their shoulder before the door slammed shut again.</p><p>Rio was giggling beneath her, her fingers still tangled in Agatha’s hoodie. “Guess we’re not being subtle.”</p><p>Agatha sighed dramatically. “Nope. But do I care?”</p><p>Rio tugged her down into another kiss. “Not even a little.”</p><p>"Well, someone’s happy to see me!" Rio laughed, nuzzling Salem’s soft fur. Agatha chuckled, her eyes sparkling as she reached out to pet the puppy.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said with a smile, giving Salem a gentle scratch behind the ears. “I missed you, too.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t stop grinning as she watched Rio and Salem reconnect. It was a simple moment, but to her, it felt like everything was coming together. The three of them—Agatha, Rio, and Salem—felt like a perfect little family, and Agatha knew, deep down, that this was the beginning of something real.</p><p>As the reunion unfolded, the rest of the band filed into the backstage area, clearly ready to tease Agatha about having Rio there. Alice, Jennifer, and Loki all exchanged knowing glances before Alice spoke up with a smirk.</p><p>“Look at this,” Alice teased, motioning to the way Agatha and Rio were clearly inseparable. “I think Agatha's in love.”</p><p>Jennifer leaned in, raising an eyebrow. “I’m starting to think you two are more in love than you’re letting on,” she said, crossing her arms and grinning at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her smile was soft. She shrugged, trying to play it off. “Shut up, guys. Just a couple of people who like each other’s company.”</p><p>Loki, always the joker, added, “Yeah, who can’t keep their hands off each other.” He gestured to the way Agatha had been holding Rio’s hand as they talked, and how Rio kept stealing glances at her. “It’s cute, but come on.”</p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head. “You guys are too much. Agatha’s just... special,” she said, her voice warm but playful. “And Salem's even more special.”</p><p>The teasing continued as the band made light of Agatha’s newfound relationship, but Agatha didn't mind. In fact, she was grateful for their lighthearted banter. It reminded her that, even with the pressure of her career, she still had people who cared about her—who cared about her happiness, even if it came with a little embarrassment.</p><p>“I’m just here for the puppy cuddles,” Rio added, drawing the attention away from their closeness. Salem had now climbed onto her lap, and Rio was petting her with a contented smile.</p><p>Just as the laughter settled, the backstage door swung open again, and this time, Agatha barely had a second to react before she was wrapped in a familiar, warm embrace.</p><p>“Mom,” Agatha breathed, sinking into the hug. The scent of incense—her mother’s signature—filled her senses, grounding her in a way nothing else could.</p><p>Lilia held her tight, her hand cradling the back of Agatha’s head the way she always had when she was small. “I am so, so proud of you,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion.</p><p>Agatha felt a lump rise in her throat. No matter how many sold-out shows she played, nothing compared to hearing those words from her mother. She squeezed her eyes shut for a second, swallowing hard before she pulled back just enough to look at Lilia’s face.</p><p>“Thank you for coming,” she said softly.</p><p>Lilia gave her a look - one that said of course I came, silly girl - before cupping her cheek. “I wouldn’t miss it for the world. You were incredible out there.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breathy laugh, rubbing at her slightly damp eyes. “You’re gonna make me cry, and I just got off stage.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled, tucking a strand of Agatha’s damp hair behind her ear. “I’d say you deserve a little crying after a show like that.”</p><p>Then, her gaze shifted past Agatha, landing on Rio, who was watching the reunion with a fond smile.</p><p>“Hey,” Lilia said, her voice instantly lighter as she pulled Rio into a hug just as tight as Agatha’s had been, as though they’d not driven there and spent the whole time together.</p><p>Rio laughed, hugging her back without hesitation.</p><p>“You look good together,” Lilia said, pulling back.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said with a grin, glancing at Agatha. “She always looks good.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes twinkled as she looked between them, clearly catching onto something unspoken.</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Mom.”</p><p>“What?” Lilia said innocently, raising her hands. “It’s nice to see you both so happy.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t deny it. Instead, she squeezed Rio’s hand and looked back at her mom. “So, did you have fun? Did you get to enjoy the show, or were you too busy making friends with the security team again?”</p><p>Lilia laughed. “Okay, first of all, I did enjoy the show. Second, I may have chatted with a few security guys. But that’s just good networking, baby.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Lilia said, feigning a dramatic bow.</p><p>Alice, ever the instigator, piped up from across the room, “Lilia, please tell us embarrassing stories. We need leverage.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a glare. “Don’t encourage her.”</p><p>Lilia grinned, clearly delighted. “Oh, I have plenty.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, already regretting everything. But as she watched her mom seamlessly fall into conversation with Rio and her bandmates, she couldn’t help but smile.</p><p>This—this warmth, this laughter, this feeling of belonging—was everything she had missed. And with Rio here, with her mom here, she felt peace.</p><p>Agatha and Rio spent the evening wrapped up in each other’s company. After the concert, they retreated to Agatha’s hotel room for some quiet time away from the prying eyes of the tour. The room felt like a sanctuary, a place where they could just be themselves, without the stress of the band, fans, or the constant buzz of the tour life.</p><p>Salem, who had been enjoying the extra attention, was now nestled comfortably between the two of them on the bed. Agatha couldn’t help but smile at the sight of her, her little body curled up in the middle, content and happy. It felt like everything was falling into place.</p><p>As the night wore on, once they’d reconnected on a physical level, they chatted softly, sharing stories and small moments that made their connection feel more and more genuine. Every now and then, they would steal a kiss or simply enjoy the silence between them, holding hands or playing with Salem. The world outside their hotel room felt so far away, and Agatha relished the simplicity of the moment.</p><p>At one point, as they both lay back on the bed, Agatha couldn’t help but want to commemorate their reunion. It wasn’t uncommon for her to share little snippets of her life with her fans, especially when Salem was involved, and tonight felt like one of those nights.</p><p>She snapped a picture of their legs intertwined on the bed, just their feet visible, a peaceful moment in the quiet of the room. Salem was sprawled between them, her little head resting comfortably on Agatha’s foot. She made sure not to show Rio’s face, keeping the focus on the serenity of the scene. It was a snapshot of the connection they were building, of the quiet moments that meant so much, even without being publicly declared.</p><p>After consent from Rio, Agatha posted the picture with a simple caption: Nights like these ❤️🔒</p><p>The image was soft and intimate, and while it didn’t give anything to indicate who Rio was, it still spoke volumes to those who followed her. It wasn’t the same as the usual tour photos of her on stage, drenched in sweat and screaming into the mic. This was something different. Something more personal. Something Agatha cherished, even if she kept it subtle.</p><p>She set her phone down and looked over at Rio, who was smiling softly. “You’re not mad, right?” Agatha asked, her voice a little playful but also searching for reassurance.</p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “Of course not. It’s just… nice, you know?” She ran her fingers through Salem’s fur. “You’re sharing pieces of us without broadcasting me, it’s kind of beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her heart warming. She didn’t have to explain it. She didn’t have to make anything more of it. They were just enjoying their time together while they could, before the next city and that was enough.</p><p>The next morning, Agatha woke up to a flurry of notifications on her phone. The moment she opened Instagram, her feed was flooded with comments, mentions, and tagged posts. The picture she’d shared the night before—of their intertwined legs and Salem nestled between them—had caught the attention of her fans in a way she hadn’t anticipated.</p><p>The comments were a mix of adoration, curiosity, and speculation.</p><p>The rumors started to spread like wildfire. Even some media outlets picked up on it. A few gossip blogs posted articles about Harkness’s mysterious girlfriend - not naming names but hinting that Agatha might have found someone special while on tour. They analyzed the picture, trying to decode the body language, the setting, even the angle of the shot, as if every detail could reveal more about her private life.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh, despite the growing gossip. She knew this would happen. Her fans were obsessed with every little detail of her life, and the idea that someone might actually have the ability to slip past the radar of her chaotic existence was almost laughable. But at the same time, it made her feel even more protective of Rio.</p><p>She wanted to keep this piece of herself private, at least for now.</p><p>Rio had never been in the public eye like Agatha, and Agatha wasn’t ready to throw her into the whirlwind of speculation and headlines. She knew Rio wasn’t ready for the scrutiny that would inevitably come with being associated with her—especially since Rio was someone who valued her privacy.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t ready to shout from the rooftops about her relationship with Rio. She didn’t want to be anyone’s "couple goals" or be put on display for the world to judge. What she had with Rio felt real and intimate, and it was theirs.</p><p>As the picture Agatha shared of her and Rio’s legs entwined with Salem snuggled between them continued to make its rounds on Instagram, the comments were flooding in. Fans couldn’t get enough of the intimate moment.</p><p>@harkness_lover: You can’t fool us, Harkness. That’s DEFINITELY a girlfriend hand. Are you finally happy? 💕</p><p>@alicejennfan: LMAO if this is the ‘I’m keeping it private’ phase, I’m excited to see where this goes... #HarknessSecretGirlfriend</p><p>@Salem_says_hello: Honestly, I love how you’re sharing this with us but not giving us the full picture… like, the tease is REAL. We’ll wait! #respectprivacy</p><p>@wild_rose28: THE VIBES IN THIS PHOTO??? So cozy and real. Love that we get to see a quieter side of you, Agatha 💖</p><p>@not_so_silentfan: Agatha, we see you. Keeping it lowkey. Respect. But also... you’re making us all crazy over here. #SHEHASAGIRLFRIEND #HarknessGossip</p><p>The comments ranged from playful to supportive, with fans dissecting every part of the photo, trying to uncover every secret. There were those who embraced Agatha’s need for privacy and those who couldn’t resist the temptation to try and figure out who the mystery woman was.</p><p>Some fans were simply happy to see Agatha so content, with one comment standing out from the rest:</p><p>@supportivefan23: Whatever’s going on here, I’m just so glad to see you in a good place, Harkness. We’ve been with you through everything, and we’re here for whatever comes next 💖</p><p>That one hit Agatha in the chest. She knew that the fans who had supported her for years would respect her boundaries, even if they were curious. But they were right: she wasn’t quite ready to share the full picture with the world.</p><p>Instead of getting overwhelmed by the questions, she decided to engage in a more subtle way—she liked a few of the more supportive comments, smiled, and moved on with her day. The tour was still in full swing, and she had a show to prepare for.</p><p>But as the notifications continued to ping, Agatha couldn’t help but feel a flutter in her chest. Her relationship with Rio might have started quietly, but in its own way, it was beginning to make waves.</p>

<p>The next morning, Agatha woke to the soft hum of the hotel’s air conditioning and the scent of Rio’s shampoo lingering on the pillow beside her. Salem was curled up near her feet, stretching lazily as sunlight filtered through the curtains. For a few blissful seconds, she let herself exist in that quiet space—no screaming fans, no flashing cameras, just Rio, Salem, and the soft sheets tangled around them.</p><p>Then, her phone buzzed again.</p><p>She groaned, reluctantly rolling over to check it, already knowing what she’d find. More notifications, more comments, more speculation. That single picture from last night had set the internet ablaze, and despite trying to keep things subtle, her fans were relentless.</p><p>She barely had a second to register the latest wave of chaos before Rio stirred beside her, blinking up sleepily. “Mm. Morning,” Rio mumbled, voice thick with sleep. She stretched, reaching for Salem, who immediately rolled onto his back for belly rubs.</p><p>Agatha smirked, setting her phone down. “Morning, professor.”</p><p>Rio groaned, hiding her face against the pillow. “Don’t call me that in bed.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, propping herself up on an elbow. “You are a professor.”</p><p>Rio cracked one eye open. “And you’re a pop star. If I don’t call you Rock Goddess Harkness at seven in the morning, you don’t get to call me professor.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Fair enough.” She paused, watching Rio rub at her eyes. “What’s your day like?”</p><p>Rio yawned. “I’ve got research at the greenhouse today. Some stuff with plant genetics and environmental stress responses. Super exciting,” she teased, nudging Agatha’s knee under the covers. “Wanna come?”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow, smirking. “I already did, many times.“</p><p>“Shut up idiot. I mean with me today?”</p><p>“To your lab?”</p><p>“Mhm. I can sneak you in. It’s just research today, no students. No one will recognize you in there.”</p><p>Agatha considered it. The idea of stepping into Rio’s world, away from the noise of hers, was more than appealing. “Wait—will my mim be there today?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Yep. And we’re meeting her for lunch.”</p><p>Agatha groaned dramatically, flopping back against the pillows. “You planned this.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Maybe. I figured you could use a break from being famous.” She trailed a hand down Agatha’s arm, her voice softening. “You’ve been going nonstop. Come hide out with me for a day.”</p><p>Agatha let out a slow breath. A full day with Rio, no pressure, no cameras—just plants and science and a quiet lunch with her mom? Yeah. She could use that.</p><p>She turned her head, grinning. “Alright, professor. Sneak me in.”</p><p>Two hours later, Agatha stood in front of a nondescript brick building on Stanford’s campus, oversized sunglasses covering most of her face. She tugged at the hood of her sweatshirt as Rio unlocked the door.</p><p>“No one’s gonna recognize you,” Rio reassured, pushing the door open. “Besides, this is a biology building. Not exactly where people expect to find a pop star.”</p><p>Agatha huffed. “You underestimate how crazy people can get.”</p><p>Rio just laughed, guiding her inside. The greenhouse was warm, humid, and alive with rows of plants, some flowering, some small and green, stretched under glass panels that let the sunlight in. The smell of soil and fresh leaves filled the space, and Agatha felt a surprising sense of calm settle over her.</p><p>“This is where the magic happens,” Rio said, leading her toward a workstation with a microscope and a cluster of labeled petri dishes. “We’re studying how different stressors affect plant growth—climate changes, pollutants, stuff like that.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, peering at one of the tiny plants under a light. “So, you’re, like, saving the world?”</p><p>Rio snorted. “Trying. One tiny chloroplast at a time.”</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio slipped into work mode, moving between the equipment with practiced ease, explaining bits of her research as she went. She spoke with a kind of quiet passion that made Agatha want to listen, even if half the words went over her head.</p><p>At one point, Rio handed her a petri dish. “Wanna help?”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Am I qualified?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Not even remotely.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled but played along, following Rio’s instructions. They spent the next hour in easy conversation—Agatha asking the occasional (mostly ridiculous) question, Rio patiently explaining things, all while Salem dozed in a sunny spot near the worktable.</p><p>For the first time in weeks, Agatha felt like she was existing. Not performing, not being watched—just in the moment, being.</p><p>At noon, they left the greenhouse and made their way across campus to a small café where Lilia was already waiting, a steaming cup of tea in front of her.</p><p>Lilia grinned the moment she saw them. “There’s my favorite scientist and my favourite child.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, bending down to hug her. “Hey, Mom.”</p><p>Lilia pressed a kiss to her temple before pulling Rio into a hug as well. “How’s my new favorite daughter-in-law?”</p><p>Rio choked on a laugh. “Lilia.”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Mom, please.”</p><p>Lilia just winked, completely unbothered as she gestured for them to sit. “So, how was the top-secret lab adventure?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, nudging Rio as they slid into the booth. “I didn’t break anything.”</p><p>Rio hummed. “Yet.”</p><p>Lunch was easy—filled with laughter, teasing, and stories from Agatha’s childhood that she desperately wished her mom wouldn’t share.</p><p>As they finished eating, Lilia reached across the table, squeezing Agatha’s hand. “I’m glad you took a break today,” she said softly. “You needed it.”</p><p>Agatha met her gaze and exhaled. “Yeah,” she admitted. “I really did.”</p><p>Rio smiled, brushing her fingers against Agatha’s under the table. All three of them enjoying the moment.</p><p>The greenhouse was warm and filled with the earthy scent of soil and greenery, the sunlight filtering through the glass panels casting dappled patterns on the tiled floor when they returned after the lunch. Rio moved through the rows of plants with practiced ease, carefully checking the temperature gauges and misting nozzles as she talked.</p><p>Agatha, disguised in her stanford sweatshirt and baseball cap to avoid recognition, had been following along for the past hour, but she’d long since stopped trying to keep up with the scientific explanations. It wasn’t that she wasn’t interested—she was. But watching Rio work, seeing the way her eyes lit up when she talked about photosynthesis and soil pH levels, was infinitely more captivating.</p><p>Rio was in her element, completely oblivious to the way Agatha was watching her, leaning on her hand, her expression soft and a little dazed.</p><p>“…and this one,” Rio continued, gesturing to a particularly lush cluster of greenery, “is Mimosa pudica, also called the sensitive plant. Watch this.” She reached out and gently brushed her fingers along the delicate leaves. Instantly, they curled inward, reacting to the touch.</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet “Whoa,” but she wasn’t really looking at the plant.</p><p>Rio glanced at her with a pleased smile, clearly thrilled to be sharing something she loved. “Cool, right? It’s a defense mechanism—when the leaves fold up, it makes them look less appealing to herbivores. Plus, it helps reduce water loss.”</p><p>Agatha hummed in response, still leaning on her hand, still staring at Rio, who was now explaining something about root systems and symbiotic relationships with bacteria.</p><p>She had no idea what Rio was saying anymore.</p><p>All she could focus on was the way Rio’s hands moved when she talked, how she gestured excitedly, her voice animated and full of passion. The way she scrunched her nose just a little when she was deep in thought. The way the light caught the dark waves of her hair, a few strands escaping her ponytail.</p><p>And then, out of nowhere, the thought hit her like a tidal wave.</p><p>Oh. Oh. I love her.</p><p>It wasn’t some grand, dramatic realization. It was quiet, like a puzzle piece clicking into place.</p><p>She loved Rio.</p><p>She loved the way she rambled about plants like they were the most fascinating things in the world. She loved the way she absentmindedly tucked her hair behind her ear when she was focused. She loved how her hands were always moving, expressive and full of life.</p><p>She loved the way Rio cared about her students, about her work, about every tiny, intricate detail of the world around her.</p><p>Agatha felt a warmth spread through her chest, soft and overwhelming all at once. She wanted to kiss her. She wanted to tell her. But more than anything, she just wanted to be here, in this moment, soaking in every part of Rio exactly as she was.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Rio’s voice pulled her out of her daze. She was looking at her now, brows raised, clearly amused. “Are you even listening?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught red-handed. A slow smile tugged at her lips. “Mmhmm,” she hummed, still leaning on her hand, still hopelessly besotted. “Something about… bacteria?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but she was laughing. “Unbelievable. You literally have the attention span of Salem.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “I’m just appreciating the view.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes in suspicion. “You’re not even trying to be subtle, are you?”</p><p>“Not even a little,” Agatha admitted, her voice warm.</p><p>Rio shook her head, but there was a hint of pink on her cheeks as she turned back to her work. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>Agatha just sighed dreamily. “And you love it.”</p><p>Rio didn’t argue. She just reached out and gently flicked Agatha’s nose before moving on to the next row of plants.</p><p>And Agatha, still smiling, still feeling like her heart was floating, followed her without question.</p><p>Later that night, Agatha stood at the edge of the stage, heart pounding in sync with the heavy bass thrumming through the speakers. The crowd was electric, a sea of bodies pressed together, shouting her name, hands reaching, phones flashing. This was the part she knew best—the moment before the storm, where adrenaline and anticipation tangled in her veins, ready to explode the second she stepped into the light.</p><p>She exhaled sharply, rolling her shoulders, then glanced over her shoulder toward the side stage.</p><p>And there she was.</p><p>Rio stood just beyond the curtain, arms crossed, watching her with a small, knowing smile. She wasn’t part of the chaos—not like the techs running around or the stage manager counting down in her headset—but she was there. Waiting.</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened.</p><p>Rio had been backstage the previous night after the show but tonight, she was here.  From the beginning of the show like she belonged.</p><p>And Agatha had never wanted to run toward something more.</p><p>“Two minutes,” someone called.</p><p>She tore her eyes away, bouncing on the balls of her feet, forcing herself back into the headspace she needed to be in. She had a show to do.</p><p>But as she stepped forward, mic in hand, the weight of Rio’s gaze followed her.</p><p>And for the first time in a long time, she didn’t feel like she was facing the stage alone.</p><p>The set was fire.</p><p>Agatha was a force, commanding every inch of the stage, her voice raw and relentless. She felt it tonight—every lyric, every note, the energy of the crowd feeding her like fuel. But beneath it all, there was something new anchoring her, something steady.</p><p>Between songs, she turned toward the side stage, toward the shadows where Rio stood just out of sight. And every time, Rio was there—watching, waiting, with her.</p><p>By the last song, Agatha was breathless, drenched in sweat, fingers aching in the best way. The final chord rang out, the crowd screaming, and she stepped back, lifting the mic with a grin.</p><p>“California,” she panted, voice hoarse from singing. “You’ve been fucking incredible tonight.”</p><p>The audience roared.</p><p>She let the noise wash over her, let it sink into her skin, then exhaled sharply. “I’ve only got one more day here before I’m back on the road.” A chorus of disappointed boos rose up, but she laughed, shaking her head. “I know, I know. But, uh… before I go, I wanna do something a little different.”</p><p>A murmur of excitement rippled through the crowd.</p><p>“I have one more song," she said, her voice raw but steady. "It’s new. And it’s for someone very special." She didn’t have to look to know Rio would be listening intently, just out of sight behind the velvet curtains at the side of the stage.</p><p>They had kept their love a secret, stolen moments in hotel rooms, whispered confessions in dressing rooms, fingertips brushing in the dark when no one was looking. But tonight, Agatha wanted the world to feel even a fraction of what she felt for Rio.</p><p>A hush fell over the crowd as the first gentle notes echoed through the stadium. Her voice, softer now, carried through the air like a secret finally set free.</p><p>"I see you in the quiet places,<br/>A shadow where the spotlight fades.<br/>I reach for you in hidden spaces,<br/>A love we never name."</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched from behind the curtain, her hands pressed against her chest. Agatha was singing a song for her.</p><p>*"But when the stars fall down, and the crowd is gone,<br/>I’ll be coming home , where I belong.<br/>No cameras, no headlines, just you and me”</p><p>The melody soared, carrying with it every late-night face time call, every touch, every moment with Rio untouched by the rest of the world. And as Agatha held that final note, her gaze lifted, searching for Rio’s. Even from the shadows, she could see the shine in her lover’s eyes.</p><p>For the first time, their love wasn’t just a secret. It was a song.</p><p>But tonight, it was about Rio.</p><p>And as she sang, as the melody carried through the venue, she swore she could feel Rio’s heartbeat in time with hers.</p><p>The moment Agatha stepped offstage, she barely had time to catch her breath before Rio was there, pulling her into the shadows, away from the chaos.</p><p>“You” Rio started, shaking her head like she was still processing everything. “That last song.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, still buzzing, still high on everything. “Did you like it?”</p><p>Rio stared at her, eyes dark and unreadable. “That song, was that for me?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, but her smirk softened into something real. “Yeah. It was.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, running a hand through her hair. “Jesus, Agatha.”</p><p>And then she was moving, closing the space between them, fingers curling into Agatha’s hoodie, pulling her down into a kiss that was almost indecent.</p><p>Agatha melted into it, still breathless, still tasting the night on her lips.</p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to murmur against her mouth, “I can’t believe you wrote a song for me.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Believe it, professor.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but she was smiling, and Agatha knew this was the start of irreversible.  Although she wasn’t ready to take that step of actually confessing to Rio just yet, she would show her in other ways.</p>

<p>Agatha was exhausted. The tour was done, the final show had been an absolute spectacle, and she had left chaos in her wake both onstage and online. Now, she was finally home. Well, home-home.</p><p>She pulled into her mother’s driveway, the familiar white house standing unchanged against the backdrop of the late evening sky. Salem, curled up in her carrier on the passenger seat, let out a dramatic sigh as if to say, *finally.* Agatha couldn’t blame her. Months on the road, constantly in motion, had worn them both down. She loved performing, loved the adrenaline, the connection with her fans—but nothing compared to coming back to this. The house, with its weathered shutters and the porch swing that creaked in the wind, remained exactly as she remembered. Her mother never saw the need for renovations or upgrades, and that stability was a comfort Agatha hadn’t realized she’d missed so much.</p><p>She stretched as she stepped out of the car, her muscles still aching from the back-to-back performances, and that was when she saw her—</p><p>Rio, sitting on the porch steps, scrolling through her phone, looking unfairly good in an old hoodie with the sleeves pulled over her hands, legs casually crossed like she belonged there.</p><p>Agatha’s heart clenched.</p><p>Rio looked up the moment the car door shut, her face breaking into a small, knowing smirk. For a second, they just stared at each other. Agatha took her in—the easy posture, the warm brown eyes that flickered with something unreadable, the way she looked the same yet somehow even better than Agatha remembered.</p><p>“You’re home,” Rio said, voice warm and teasing, like she hadn’t been keeping up with every moment of Agatha’s tour from afar.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, stepping closer. “Yeah.” She tilted her head. “You waiting for me?”</p><p>Rio slipped her phone into her pocket, standing with a stretch. “Maybe.” Her gaze flicked over Agatha, slow and appreciative. “Or maybe I just like your mom’s porch.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh. “Liar.”</p><p>Rio’s smirk widened, but she didn’t deny it. Instead, she reached for Agatha, pulling her into a hug so tight and warm that Agatha immediately felt like the past few months had been worth it. She melted into it, pressing her face into Rio’s shoulder, breathing her in.</p><p>“I missed you,” she murmured, voice muffled against the fabric of Rio’s hoodie.</p><p>Rio’s fingers curled against the back of her sweatshirt. “I missed you too.” Then, quieter, “You caused absolute chaos out there, you know that?”</p><p>Agatha pulled back just enough to grin at her. “Did I?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “The internet is still recovering.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, completely unrepentant. “Good.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but her smile remained. Then, as if drawn in by some unseen force, she leaned in, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s jaw, then her cheek, then finally, finally, her lips. It was slow, warm, lingering—the kind of kiss that made Agatha truly feel like she was home.</p><p>From the car, Salem let out an impatient bark, utterly done with their reunion.</p><p>Agatha sighed, forehead still resting against Rio’s. “Guess we should get the little princess inside.”</p><p>Rio snickered, stepping back. “I’ll help.”</p><p>Inside, the scent of garlic, herbs, and something rich simmering on the stove wrapped around Agatha like a hug. She barely had time to set Salem’s carrier down before her mother appeared in the doorway of the kitchen, hands on her hips, surveying her like she was assessing damage.</p><p>“Finally decided to come home, huh?” Lilia Harkness said, arching an eyebrow.</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Missed me?”</p><p>Lilia huffed, stepping forward to cup Agatha’s face, thumbs brushing over her cheeks like she was committing her to memory. “You look tired, darling.” Then, turning to Rio without missing a beat, “And you, are you staying for dinner? Have you been keeping up with this one’s madness online?”</p><p>Rio laughed, shooting Agatha a knowing look. “Trying my best.”</p><p>Lilia muttered something about exhausting behavior before waving them both toward the kitchen. “I made dinner. Sit. Eat. You’ve been living off takeout and coffee for three months.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t argue. She was starving, and nothing compared to her mother’s cooking. Roast chicken, garlic and herb potatoes, seasoned vegetables—the kind of food she had been craving for weeks.</p><p>“God, I love you,” Agatha groaned as she took her first bite.</p><p>Lilia just shook her head. “Of course you do.” Then, lowering her voice conspiratorially, she added, “You should see what my students have been saying about your outfits lately.”</p><p>Rio choked on her drink, laughing. “Oh, I have seen.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, unfazed. “Everyone’s obsessed with me.”</p><p>“They think you’ve lost your mind.”</p><p>“Same thing.”</p><p>Rio snickered while Lilia muttered something about *so much drama in one body.* But the conversation drifted into easy storytelling—Agatha’s tour chaos, Rio’s research projects, the latest neighborhood gossip. It was normal, effortless, something Agatha had missed more than she realized.</p><p>Under the table, she reached for Rio’s hand, squeezing once. Rio shot her a quick smile, squeezing back. For the first time in months, Agatha felt like she could breathe.</p><p>Later that night, Rio’s apartment was dimly lit by the glow of the streetlights outside. The second the door shut, Agatha dropped her bag, grabbing Rio’s hoodie and pulling her in with the kind of urgency that had been simmering between them all night.</p><p>The kiss was deep, hungry, pulling a small gasp from Rio before she melted into it. Clothes disappeared between breathless laughter and whispered curses. Hands roamed, relearning and rediscovering, the heat between them unbearable and intoxicating all at once.</p><p>And when they finally came down, tangled in sheets and each other, their breathing slow and steady, Agatha traced her fingers along the contours of Rio’s face. She took in the flushed skin, the way Rio’s lips were still swollen, the small, satisfied smile playing at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>She had been holding it in for weeks, maybe longer, but now, in this moment, it was impossible to keep inside.</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>Rio stilled. For a flicker of a second, Agatha felt a flash of panic—too soon, too much. But then Rio grabbed her hand, halting her movements, and met her eyes with something so soft, so full of warmth that it stole Agatha’s breath away.</p><p>Rio exhaled a small, disbelieving laugh. “Say it again.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, brushing a hand through Rio’s hair. “I love you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate this time. She surged up, kissing Agatha so deeply it made her head spin. When she pulled back, her own voice was barely above a whisper. “I love you too.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding, grinning as she pulled Rio even closer. “Good. Now you’re stuck with me.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but she was smiling. “I wouldn’t want it any other way.”</p><p>And as they drifted to sleep, cocooned in each other’s arms, that sentiment was silently reaffirmed between them.</p><p>The next morning, golden light poured through the kitchen window, casting soft shadows across the countertops. The scent of coffee and sizzling eggs filled the air as Rio stood at the stove, moving with easy confidence. She had pulled on one of Agatha’s oversized band tees, the fabric hanging loose off one shoulder, exposing warm, sun-kissed skin. The sight made Agatha pause in the doorway, her heart catching in her chest.</p><p>Salem, ever the diva, sat at her feet, staring up at Rio with the intensity only a small, spoiled dog could manage. Her tail thumped impatiently against the floor.</p><p>"You're not getting any, little lady," Rio informed her, sparing a glance down as she flipped the eggs.</p><p>Salem whined dramatically, flopping onto her side in defeat. Agatha huffed a laugh, stepping into the room.</p><p>"Are you starving my daughter?" she asked, slipping her arms around Rio from behind, resting her chin on her shoulder.</p><p>Rio smirked. "Your daughter thinks she deserves eggs for breakfast."</p><p>"And she’s right." Agatha pressed a slow, lingering kiss to Rio’s neck before pulling back just enough to watch her cook. "You know, you look criminally good like this."</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow. "Like what?"</p><p>Agatha's fingers traced the exposed skin of Rio’s shoulder, voice low and teasing. "Cooking in my shirt, looking like you belong in my kitchen."</p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly, eyes glinting with something unreadable. "Your kitchen, huh?"</p><p>Agatha shrugged, pressing another kiss to her shoulder. "Maybe one day."</p><p>Rio stilled for a moment, then flipped the eggs onto a plate, turning in Agatha’s arms to face her fully. She studied her like she was trying to commit every detail to memory—the messy curls, the lazy, satisfied expression, the way she looked at her like she was the only thing in the world worth seeing.</p><p>"You're gonna kill me," Rio murmured, shaking her head, but there was nothing but affection in her voice.</p><p>Agatha grinned. "That sounds like a you problem."</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but leaned in anyway, brushing their lips together in a slow, sweet kiss. Behind them, Salem let out an impatient bark, breaking the moment.</p><p>"Alright, alright, breakfast first," Rio said, laughing as she pulled back.</p><p>Agatha pouted but released her, watching as Rio grabbed two plates and set them on the small kitchen table. The domesticity of it all—the casual way they moved around each other, the ease of their laughter—filled Agatha with something warm and overwhelming.</p><p>She reached for her phone, snapping a quick picture—Rio standing at the stove, the morning sun hitting her in the perfect way, the shirt slipping down her shoulder, Salem sitting at her feet like a tiny, demanding queen. It was perfect.</p><p>"Rio?" she asked, stepping up behind her again. "Can I post this?"</p><p>Rio glanced at the screen, then back at her, searching her face. "You sure?"</p><p>Agatha nodded. "I don’t want to just hint at it anymore. I want them to know I’m yours."</p><p>Rio's lips curled into a soft, knowing smile, reviewing the picture to make sure her face wasn’t visible. "Then post it."</p><p>Agatha tapped the screen, fingers hovering for a moment before she typed the caption carefully.</p><p>**Lucky to be home with this incredible woman who I call mine. ❤️**</p><p>She hit post before she could overthink it. The rush of it hit her all at once—this was real now. No more games, no more secrecy.</p><p>Rio looked over her shoulder, reading the words. When she turned back, her expression was something softer, something deeper. "So, I’m your incredible woman now, huh?"</p><p>Agatha smirked, pulling her closer. "You always have been."</p><p>Rio searched her eyes, her hand coming up to cup Agatha’s cheek. "You’re sure about this?"</p><p>Agatha leaned into her touch, voice unwavering. "Absolutely."</p><p>Rio exhaled, a small, almost disbelieving smile playing at her lips. "Good. Because I’ve been in love with you for a while now, and I don’t want anyone thinking you're available."</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. The certainty in those words, the way Rio said them like they were the most obvious thing in the world, made her heart stutter. She grinned, unable to help herself. "Well, that works out, because I love you too."</p><p>Rio pulled her in for a kiss—slow, deep, the kind that settled something inside both of them.</p><p>As they finally sat down for breakfast, Salem curled up at Agatha’s feet, still hoping for scraps, and Agatha's phone buzzed relentlessly on the counter. The internet was, predictably, losing its mind.</p><p>@Harkybabbiiee: That caption though... this is EVERYTHING. Salem looking at mystery girl like shes her other mother ❤️</p><p>@justinesydney: Um... guys, Harkness just confirmed it... she has a girlfriend 💁‍♀️</p><p>@thesophieeffect: OMG, I think I’m crying?? Agatha’s got a girlfriend and she’s so happy! ❤️💖</p><p>@heatherhark_cool: Wait a second, did anyone else notice the shirt situation... Agatha’s t-shirt? 👀😏</p><p>Agatha snickered, glancing at Rio, who was already rolling her eyes.</p><p>Rio just took a sip of her coffee, smirking. "Let them lose their minds."</p><p>Agatha laughed, reaching for her hand. "I really, really love you."</p><p>Rio squeezed her fingers. "I love you too."</p><p>And as the morning light poured in, as they ate breakfast with Salem curled between them, Agatha knew, without a doubt, that she was exactly where she was meant to be.</p>

<p>Agatha's time at Rio's house became more frequent as the weeks passed, and the two enjoyed a period of blissful privacy. Their days were filled with cozy mornings and intimate dinners, while nights were spent in each other's arms, always with bursts of laughter. Agatha, especially after the chaos of the last leg of the tour, felt at peace in Rio’s presence—her grounding, steady presence amid the whirlwind of her career.</p><p>They’d go on dates, and although they were spotted here and there by fans and paparazzi, Rio's face remained mysteriously obscured. Agatha, not keen on publicly outing her girlfriend just yet, especially as Rio preferred to keep a low profile. It became a running mystery for fans, who speculated endlessly about the identity of the woman who seemed to have captured Agatha's heart.</p><p>At one point, a fan captured a blurry picture of them walking hand-in-hand through a park, Agatha's face glowing with the unmistakable joy of someone completely in love, but Rio’s face was hidden behind a scarf and sunglasses. The internet exploded with theories and speculation, but Agatha stayed tight-lipped, only fueling the curiosity.</p><p>But now, the Grammys were just around the corner. Two months of careful planning are ahead, and as much as Agatha was thrilled by the nomination, the thought of stepping onto that red carpet, surrounded by millions of eyes, was daunting. She’s been in the spotlight for years, but this was different—this is her first time with someone she truly cared about, someone who meant more than all the awards combined.</p><p>One evening, after a long, winding dinner at Rio’s, Agatha felt an urge to speak the words she'd been holding inside for a while.</p><p>"Rio, there's something I want to ask you," Agatha said, her voice barely above a whisper as they sat on the couch, the soft hum of music in the background.</p><p>Rio, always calm and attentive, tilted her head and looked at her with those deep, quiet eyes. "What’s on your mind?"</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath. "The Grammys are in a couple of months, and I’m nominated for a few awards... but I don’t want to go alone. I want you to be my date."</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed for a moment, as if the weight of the request was sinking in. The Grammys were a big deal—probably one of the biggest moments of Agatha’s career—but the idea of publicly acknowledging their relationship in such a public space was a huge step. She’d always been careful about her privacy.</p><p>"Are you sure?" Rio asked, her voice steady but there was a slight vulnerability in it, as if she was bracing for the chaos that might come.</p><p>Agatha reached for her hand, intertwining their fingers, looking at her with a certainty in her eyes. "Yes. I don’t want to hide anymore. You’re my person, Rio. And I want everyone to know it."</p><p>Rio’s face softened, a small smile pulling at the corners of her lips. She leaned in and kissed Agatha gently. "Okay. I’ll go with you, but only if we can keep it low-key, no spectacle. I’m not here for drama."</p><p>Agatha laughs softly. "Same. I just want to enjoy the night with you. We’ve got this."</p><p>It was settled then—Rio would be her date to the Grammys. Agatha couldn’t help but feel a wave of relief and excitement rush over her. For once, she’d have the person she loves by her side, and for once, they’ll both be able to just exist as themselves. No facades. No secrets.</p><p>The countdown to the Grammys began, and with it, the excitement and nerves that come with the biggest night in the music industry. Agatha spent the days leading up to the event bouncing between rehearsals, interviews, and fittings, but one thing on her mind, more than anything else, was the moment when she’ll step onto the red carpet with Rio by her side.</p><p>Rio, though, was a whirlwind of calm amidst it all. She was as composed as ever, but Agatha could  tell she was also feeling the weight of the moment—this was new for both of them. The attention, the flashes, the whispers. It was one thing to be a private couple, but stepping into a public space like this, in front of the entire music industry... That would be a whole different ball game.</p><p>But they were ready for it. Agatha was thrilled. She knew this was the beginning of something more—an era where she didn’t have to hide. Her love, her personal life, it was all finally aligned with her public persona. She was walking into the night not just as a Harkness, but as herself.</p><p>For Agatha, it was more than just clothes—her outfits were always a statement. The Grammys were her moment to shine, but she wanted to do so in a way that felt authentic. Her stylist and the team had pulled out all the stops, but this year, Agatha knew exactly what she wanted.</p><p>She went for a dramatic, couture look, a mix of elegance and edge. Her dress was a custom-made black velvet gown, its fitted bodice adorned with intricate beading and sharp, angular designs that mirrored the strength and power she felt when on the stage. The skirt flowed with an ethereal quality, a soft train trailing behind her. But it was the high slit that elevated the gown, revealing sleek stiletto heels underneath—black and glossy, high and deadly.</p><p>Her hair was styled in soft waves, her makeup smoky but clean, the focus on her eyes that always spoke louder than words. Agatha wore diamond stud earrings, a delicate necklace, and a simple bracelet. The look was glamorous but undeniably strong.</p><p>As for Rio, she opted for something less flashy, but just as elegant. She’d always been a little more understated in her fashion choices in general. Rio wore a tailored black suit, with a deep V-neck shirt beneath it, exposing just enough skin for a subtle hint of sensuality. The suit jacket was perfectly fitted to her body, cinched at the waist with a silver belt that added a touch of shine without overpowering her natural beauty.</p><p>Her shoes were classic—black leather ankle boots that gave her height but kept the look grounded, giving off that effortlessly cool, “I don’t need to try” vibe. She didn’t wear jewelry, save for a thin silver chain that rest against her collarbone, just barely visible. Rio’s makeup was natural, her hair a soft, tousled style.</p><p>She looked like she could walk into a meeting at the university or a rock concert, and either would make sense. But tonight, she was walking into the Grammys beside Agatha, and Agatha couldnt help but feel the rush of pride and affection every time she caught sight of her.</p><p>As they made their way to the Grammys, the car ride was a quiet one, the tension palpable. It was the calm before the storm, but Agatha and Rio were settled in their own bubble. Lilia, sitting beside them, occasionally cracked jokes to ease the tension, but even she knew that tonight was a monumental moment in her daughter’s life.</p><p>When they pulled up to the venue, the flashing lights of the paparazzi were blinding. Agatha gripped Rio’s hand, squeezing it reassuringly. It was a moment of vulnerability, but with Rio by her side, she knows she could handle it.</p><p>The doors of the car opened and Agatha stepped out first, the cameras clicking like wildfire as her gown swayed gracefully. Rio followed behind, her head held high, as if she was just another guest at an exclusive event. And for a moment, everything felt surreal. Agatha was  walking into her world with Rio at her side, just as she promised.</p><p>As they headed down the red carpet together, Agatha felt the warmth of Rio’s hand in hers. The cameras flashed, but it didnt matter. She was with the one person who made her feel at peace. And that was all that mattered.</p><p>The moment Agatha and Rio stepped onto the red carpet together, the buzz was instant. Cameras flashed, and reporters shouted questions in a flurry of excitement, but it was the appearance of Rio—her identity finally revealed—that truly sent social media into overdrive.</p><p>Agatha’s followers, along with the media, quickly started speculating about the woman beside her. The headlines were rapid, and every Instagram post was flooded with reactions. The fact that Rio has kept a low profile until now only added to the intrigue. It wasnt long before people started piecing together the puzzle of who she was, thanks to the power of social media and a few well-placed details.</p><p>@love_vibes10: Wait, who is this woman? Is this the girlfriend!?!?</p><p>@harryfan007: OMG I thought Agatha was dating someone from the industry, not a professor! What a power couple 🔥🔥</p><p>@fiercebeauty: I’ve seen this woman before, isn't she a biology professor at Sanford?? She’s like a real-life Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde—total babe and smart as hell 😍🔥 #goals</p><p>@keepitrealgirl: Wait, she’s a professor?? I thought she was going to be some kind of influencer or model. Talk about surprising us. What a power move, Harkness 🙌</p><p>@alexandrastarr: This is what true love looks like. Harkness always been unapologetically herself, but now it makes sense. Rio is the brains behind the beauty 💁🏽‍♀️💖 #relationshipgoals #IntellectualQueens"</p><p>@hannah_hrkns: You know, I was thinking she was some rich girl Agatha met at a charity event, but this is even better—so glad she’s with someone who’s about more than just the glitz and glamour 👏🏽</p><p>As the night unfolded , Agatha’s anticipation built. She was nominated for four major awards—Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Performance and Best New Artist—all significant categories, each one a huge milestone in her career. She glanced at Rio before every nominee was announced. Rio’s calm presence was exactly what Agatha needed, grounding her in the whirlwind of the event.</p><p>When the first award, Song of the Year, was announced, Agatha’s name was called. The audience erupted into applause as she stood up, her heart pounding. Her eyes locked with Rio’s, who gave her a proud, encouraging smile. Agatha walked to the stage, her legs feeling like jelly but her confidence shining through. She took the microphone, her voice trembling just slightly as she thanked everyone who helped her reach this point, but most importantly, she gave a heartfelt shout-out to Rio.</p><p>"Thank you to everyone who believed in me," Agatha began, pausing to find Rio’s eyes in the audience. "But especially to someone who taught me what real love looks like... Rio, thank you for always being by my side."</p><p>The room filled with cheers, and Rio’s smile was pure joy.</p><p>As the night progressed, Agatha’s name was called again and again, each win more surreal than the last. Best Performance, Album of the Year and Best New Artist, the crowd roared every time, and Agatha seemed to float through the moment, her excitement and gratitude radiating.</p><p>On each trip to the stage, Agatha thanked Rio. Each victory, it seemed, was a reflection of not just her hard work but the love and support she’d found in Rio. As she held her fourth Grammy of the night, she gave an extra-long hug to Rio before her speech, her eyes gleaming with emotion.</p><p>“This,” she says into the mic, “is for the one who taught me how to love myself, how to be real, and how to chase my dreams without fear. This Grammy is for you, Rio. You are my biggest win.”</p><p>The room erupted, and the cameras captured the pure moment of emotion. People were touched by the sincerity in Agatha’s words, and the love between the two of them was so evident. It’s was not just a celebration of Agatha’s talent, but of the love that powered her—both in her music and in her life.</p><p>@musicfan4life: Agatha’s four Grammys? WOW. But the way she looks at Rio... 🥺 This is true love💖</p><p>@just_wanna_dance: Agatha’s speech was everything. So genuine and loving, and you can see how much she cares about Rio. True love = true success 🏆</p><p>By the end of the night, Agatha’s arms were full of Grammy trophies, but it was Rio’s arms she was most thankful for. They exited the ceremony hand-in-hand, smiles wide and hearts full. The night wasn’t  just about the awards—it was about their journey, their dreams, and the undeniable bond they had built together.</p><p>The after party was a dazzling blur of lights, laughter, and celebration. The atmosphere was electric, filled with music industry elites, fellow nominees, and stars from all corners of the entertainment world. Agatha was in a daze, still soaking in the fact that she’d just won four Grammy Awards, but her smile never faded as she stepped into the event with Rio by her side.</p><p>Her band members were there too, laughing, dancing, and congratulating her at every turn.</p><p>“Four Grammys, Agatha? You’re unstoppable!” Alice shouted over the music, grinning ear to ear.</p><p>She laughed shaking her head. “I can’t even believe it. It’s surreal.”</p><p>The band members swarmed her, offering shots and making toasts to their collective success. Agatha felt the love in the room, a sense of camaraderie and mutual pride. They were all part of the moment, and it’s only right they celebrate it together.</p><p>Rio, still standing close by, was enjoying the sight of Agatha surrounded by people who truly cared for her. The smile on her face said everything—she was proud, not just of Agatha’s success, but of how much she’d grown, both as an artist and as a person. Agatha, in return, snuck a kiss to Rio’s lips as she laughed with her band.</p><p>“It’s your turn to get an award next, Rio,” Agatha teased, joking about the idea of Rio’s work getting her recognition, but there was something in the way she said it that made it clear she believed Rio was more than capable of anything she set her mind to.</p><p>Rio smiled, eyes glinting with warmth. “Only if you’re accepting it with me,” she replied playfully.</p><p>The band’s energy was infectious. Agatha’s Jen, raised her glass and challenged Agatha. “Okay, so you’ve won four Grammys. When are we getting the next one? We need a five-piece!”</p><p>Everyone laughed, and Agatha’s eyes sparkled as she nodded, knowing they were all in this together.</p><p>Everything felt perfect—the awards, the laughter, the music, and, of course, Rio by her side. But it wasnt l long before the conversation shifted.</p><p>“You’re on fire tonight,” Loki said, as if it wasn’t obvious enough from the flood of attention and congratulatory messages. “But we’ve got more press waiting outside. Are you ready for the next round of interviews?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the grin never faded. “It’s never-ending, huh?”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, looking at Agatha with a knowing gaze. “You’ve earned this, though. You’re a star.”</p><p>Agatha reached for Rio’s hand. “I wouldn’t be here without you. Let’s make sure the night’s ours too, alright?”</p><p>The idea of more interviews didn’t seem as daunting now, especially with Rio’s support.</p><p>Outside, the paparazzi were relentless as Agatha and Rio made their way through the throngs of reporters. The cameras flashed, and questions came flying from every direction.</p><p>“Harkness! Over here! What’s next for you after tonight?” one reporter yelled.</p><p>Agatha stopped and smiled, her arm around Rio’s waist. “What’s next? More music, more love, and of course, more adventures with my incredible team—and with my incredible partner, Rio.”</p><p>The crowd of photographers erupted with clicks, but it was clear they were most interested in the last part of her statement. The mention of Rio was met with a flurry of whispers, and some even took their time to snap pictures of the couple standing side by side.</p><p>“Tell us about Rio?” a voice from the crowd shouts, trying to get more information.</p><p>Agatha just smiled, squeezing Rio’s hand. “Rio’s the person who makes me feel like I can do anything. That’s all I need to say.”</p><p>The cameras flashed again, capturing the genuine affection between them, and the entire moment felt like a declaration—not just of Agatha’s success, but of her relationship. The connection between them was undeniable.</p><p>As the night continued, Agatha, Rio, and her band ended up in a quiet corner, away from the buzz of the party. A sense of calm settled over them, even as the music pulsed from the dance floor.</p><p>“You know, I always imagined winning a Grammy,” Agatha says, her voice quieter now, “but I never imagined it would feel this… right.”</p><p>Rio nodded, resting her head on Agatha’s shoulder. “Because this is your moment. You earned every single one of those awards—and you did it on your own terms.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at Rio, her heart swelling with emotion. “I couldn’t have done it without you,” she said softly, almost to herself.</p><p>Rio smiled, squeezing Agatha’s hand, knowing that words can’t fully express what this night means, not just for Agatha’s career, but for their life together. The music continued, but for Agatha and Rio, the world outside this moment felt distant—just the two of them, with the rest of the world still to discovering their story.</p><p>In the days that followed, the intrigue surrounding Rio only intensified. Articles flooded the internet, some focusing on Rio’s career as a respected biology professor at Stanford University. Others speculated on her connection to Agatha, with many marveling at how grounded and intelligent she seemed in contrast to Agatha’s fame and stardom.</p><p>Some outlets dove deeper into Rio’s background, highlighting her accomplishments in academia, while others were quick to paint her as Agatha’s "perfect match"—the person who balanced the high-flying, dazzling world Agatha inhabited with a more measured and intellectual presence.</p><p>A few online personalities even dug into her past—digging up the fact that Rio has been quietly working on groundbreaking research. The hashtag #ProfessorRio started trending, as fans rushed to find more about her academic work. Some even joked about enrolling in Stanford’s biology department to study under her, though most of the comments were filled with admiration.</p><p>"Harkness’s girlfriend finally revealed as Stanford biology professor Rio Vidal—The couple’s red carpet debut is making waves, but Rio’s career might be the real story."</p><p>Entertainment Weekly: Forget celebrity coupledom—Agatha and Rio are redefining what it means to be a power couple. With Rio’s stellar academic background and Agatha’s chart-topping success, these two are setting a new standard.</p><p>Despite the constant media storm surrounding them, Agatha and Rio remained calm and collected. Rio continued to live her quiet life, teaching at Stanford, giving lectures, and pushing the boundaries of her research. She remained largely out of the limelight, letting Agatha take the center stage when needed.</p><p>Agatha, however, couldn’t stop grinning whenever she was near Rio. The whole experience of revealing her girlfriend to the world had been surreal. But for Agatha, the moment wasn’t about the fame or the spectacle—it was about sharing her love with the person who makes her feel complete.</p><p>The world might now know who Rio is, but Agatha knew that their bond was still just theirs, even in the midst of all the flashing lights and public attention.</p><p>And soon, she’d ask the question to make that bond more permanent.</p>
