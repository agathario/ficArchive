<div class="userstuff">
<p>“What do you mean you're not getting back home for Christmas?” Her mom almost yelled over the phone as April rolled her eyes. “<em>Hija</em>, is the most important day of the year. You have to be with your family.”</p><p>“Yeah, i'm not really in the mood for the festive lights and gifts.” April said, toying with the blanket over her folded legs on the armchair. She stared at the fireplace crackling. “And, you know, hear how much of a failure i am because i’m not married anymore.” </p><p>“Tsk. Everyone already forgot about it.”</p><p>April knew she was lying.</p><p>“This could be your <em>abuela’s</em> last Christmas, how would you feel about that for the rest of your life?” April rolled her eyes again, it was probably the eight Christmas in a row that she heard the same thing. </p><p>“Whatever, i will be there.” She said, accepting defeat. </p><p>“Thank you, <em>amor</em>.” April could hear the smile in her mother’s voice before she hung up. </p><p>“Everything okay?” She turned to the living room door, catching sight of Jennifer Barkley standing there with two rum laced eggnog’s mugs.</p><p>It softened April a bit. “Yeah, I was just talking to my mom.”</p><p>Jen placed the mugs on the center table and sat on the armrest of April’s chair. The younger couldn't get over how good Jennifer looked even at home, hair flawless and a warm velvet blue juicy couture set with the word “Naughty” embezzled on her behind. “Did something happen?”</p><p>“My life is over.” April murmured, laying her head on Jen’s warm thigh. “My mother is forcing me to go home for Christmas.”</p><p>“Aww, i'm sorry.” Jen said, mockling, her long fingers finding April's hair and scalp to caress it. “Isn’t Christmas supposed to be happy? Then why would anyone want to go to Pawnee?” </p><p>“I know.” April closed her eyes, humming in approval of Jen's attention. </p><p>“I'll have to visit my mother too back in Chicago.” She said, lowering her fingers and caressing April's nape too. “Her and her new boyfriend that came directly from the Netherlands.” </p><p>April smiled, Jen's life always seemed to have a new bit to entertain her. “What about your dad? The sea captain?”</p><p>“Ah, he’s alright. Enjoying his new family across the Mediterranean.” </p><p>April kissed her knee over the leg, lifting her head. “He's stupid. You're the best daughter he could have.”</p><p>Jen held her chin between her thumb and index and pulled her in a slow kiss. “I know.” She whispered against her lips with a smile, slipping from the armrest to April's lap.</p><p>“I have an idea.”</p><p>April sighed. “Can you wait a few more minutes? My leg is still kind of cramped after that position you asked me to d-”</p><p>“Not <em>that</em> kind of idea!” Jen said playfully, shoving her shoulder lightly. “I think we should trade gifts this year.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p><em>Oh</em>.</p><p>“Really?” April shot her eyebrows up.</p><p>Jen nodded in confirmation. “Yes. I think it would be nice and, honestly, i’ve been wanting to give you a present for some time without feeling like a sugar mommy.” </p><p>“I’m pretty sure wanting to give the present just because you feel like it already puts you in the sugar mommy box.” April teased, never getting tired of joking about their age difference.</p><p>“Shut up.”Jen whispered and kissed her again. “You, me, exchanging gifts on the twenty third. What do you say”</p><p>April bit her lip, her eyes gleaming. “I say yes.” </p><p align="center">____</p><p>Maybe, April admitted it, she was a bit regretful about accepting Jennifer’s idea. Not that she didn't think the woman deserved a gift, if April could she would run over Santa Claus’ sleigh and give all the gifts destined to snotty children to Jen, she probably deserved more anyway.</p><p>April just didn't know what to give her. She was terrified of giving Jennifer something she would hate and throw on her head, yelling about how April didn't know her at all and how their whole one month and a half “thing” was a mistake.  </p><p>She thought about a suit set but she knew that all of Jen’s were custom made, so it wouldn't do.</p><p>Also considered accessories, but the older woman already had an extensive collection of the same earrings, pearl necklaces and watches she wore daily.</p><p> God, that woman had everything. What would April do?</p><p>Plus, holiday shopping was pretty much what April imagined what Hell would be like.</p><p>The lights, the decorations, the music, the happy families of stressed parents and hyperactive children running around and bumping into her.</p><p>The younger tried to probe around Jennifer on the following days, but of course she could pick up April's tactics and deflected every single time.</p><p>Worst of all, Jen seemed to sense her next move. Just when April was pretending to do her job at her boot office, seriously settling on buying her flowers, an intern left an immense bouquet of black roses on her table.</p><p>April blushed awkwardly, feeling the whole floor paying attention to her, the murmurs of gossip leaving her mortified, one colleague even had the nerve to whistle when passing through her. She wanted to kill Jennifer and kiss her on the same measure. </p><p>“I have no idea what you're talking about.” Was what Jennifer said that same night while they were laying together on April's bed and the girl talked about the situation, covered by the thin sheets with a wicked smile on her face, looking like a damn underwear model.</p><p>April chuckled with the absurdity and curled up against Jennifer's neck, aspiring the fading smell of her perfume mixed with the natural musk of her skin. Then, the solution hit her. What would be a gift that mixed April's preferences with Jennifer's ruled routine? A perfume.</p><p>So, on the very next day, April was on the clock to run around the mall to find the perfect scent, rushed between organizing her things to travel in two days and going to every single shop that selled perfume and testing so many differents that her nostrils were losing the sensibility to smell.</p><p><em>Finally</em>, on the last shop she found exactly what she had been looking for. It had azaleas and green wood on the top of the pyramid, with slight notes of fresh earth and citrus. April almost swooned thinking about smelling it on Jennifer’s skin. </p><p>On the night of December 23rd they were sitting on the carpet of Jennifer's living room surrounded by pillows and blankets on the floor, only the fireplace illuminating them as the background radio hummed Wham’s “Last Christmas” when Jen brought them a whole bottle of wine to begin the gift exchange. </p><p>“Can I go first?” April asked, too anxious to wait anymore.</p><p>“Of course, honey.” Jen said, putting a lock of April's hair behind her ear. </p><p>She took the package with shaky hands. “Look, I thought a lot about what I would get you. Like, a lot. Everything I thought about you already had.” Jen chuckled. “Honestly i was just scared that you would think I don't know you at all, but I think I do, and I hope you like it.”</p><p>April handed the bag to Jennifer, who opened it with a smile. She opened the perfume’s cap with careful hands and sniffed it, widening her eyes. “April, this is perfect!” She splashed on her wrists and rubbed them together, filling the room with the smell of it. “Honestly, I never smelled anything like this before.” Jen sniffed her own wrists, sighing. “I feel like it was made for me.”</p><p>That was everything April wanted to hear.</p><p>“Thank you.” Jennifer said, leaning in to give her a quick peck. “Don't you realize, April? Narrowing out what I already have or not already proves that you do know me. Don't pressure yourself, ok?” She caressed April's cheek with her thumb. “We’re getting to know each other, and you did very well.” </p><p>Jen turned around to reach her own package, handing it to April with a smile.</p><p>It wasn't that hard for her to choose April a gift. </p><p>Actually, everytime she looked at April's wrists, neck or fingers she imagined something there to let everyone know that April was taken, even if technically they weren't a couple. A bit selfish, she admitted, but she would get something to match April's personality, the more macabre the better. </p><p>Jennifer sat at the best jewelry store and put the worker through a two hour session of psychological warfare until she was completely satisfied with April's gift. A cord of seven polished onyx stones, hugged by silver wires that connect to each other and formed a beautiful bracelet that would look stunning against the girls’ skin.</p><p>April’s eyes shined as she pulled the bracelet from the rectangular box, smiling at it. “It's so beautiful.” Her voice was soft, stripped of any pretense or faux indifference. “I love it.”</p><p>“Here, let me put it on you.” Jen clasped the bracelet on April's wrist and caressed the skin below it, holding her hand. “It suits you.”</p><p>“It does.” April smiled. “Looks like something Death herself would wear.”</p><p>Jen chuckled, furrowing her brows. “She? The end of all living things is a lady?”</p><p>“Of course she is, Jen.” April said it like it was the most natural thing in the world. “And i bet you she is a hot one.”</p><p>“Hm, not as hot as you.” Jennifer said, pulling April to straddle her lap. </p><p>April rolled her eyes playfully to the corniness of it and hugged Jen by the neck, kissing her mouth and pressing her weight down to make Jen lay down, taking April on top. Their tongues met warmly and April moaned, already intoxicated with the smell of her new perfume. </p><p> “Sorry, was this whole death talk too bizarre?.” April asked, her hair falling like a curtain on Jen's face. </p><p>“No.” Jen shook her head, gripping her waist. “I’m strangely turned on.” </p><p>April kissed her again, sprawling her body on top of Jennifer’s as the other squeezed her ass. They rolled around the carpet, undressing and getting intimate under the covers, warmed by the fireplace and each other's bodies. </p><p>Afterwards, April laid turned to the fire, Jen's body pressed behind hers, their hands joined against April's chest. She could sense the woman sleeping but didn't dare to do the same yet, enjoying Jennifer's presence before having to face the Pawnee madness.</p><p align="center">___</p><p align="left">“April!” The jumping blonde woman was the first thing the girl saw at the gate when she desembarched on Pawnee, Indiana.</p><p align="left">Leslie came running towards her and swept her on a tight hug that April pretended not to want. She accompanied the girl to the car, doing her best to fill her in on every single thing that had happened in the last two months and how much she had missed her.</p><p align="left">April split her attention between Leslie and typing a text to Jen.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
<em>hi </em>
</p><p align="left">
<em>just arrived at Pawnee :o</em>
</p><p align="left">
<em>going to the parks and rec christmas partyy</em>
</p><p align="left">
<em>will get drunk on cheap wine and send u a video</em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Jen responded to her almost immediately.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
<em>Reporting live from Chicago</em>
</p><p align="left">
<em>Mom and her boyfriend are already fighting </em>
</p><p align="left">
<em>Christmas spirit, right?</em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The party this year was at Leslie and Ben’s new place, where the blonde couldn't stop showing everyone her engagement ring.</p><p align="left">At some point, Andy approached her to talk. Their interactions still began a bit awkward, but it was easier now to fall back in friendly conversation about life and work. She kept a safe distance from Chris Traeger, a slight bitterness inside her when she thought about him and Jennifer. </p><p align="left">Around dinner time, April was already past the normal amount of respectable sweet wine glasses and drunk dialed Jennifer's number, hiding on a secluded corner on the outside hall, her vision blurry as she waited for the older to pick up. </p><p align="left">If felt kind of exciting to have this secret, the wicked smile she hid when Ann complimented her bracelet trying to make conversation.</p><p align="left">“You promised me a video.” It was the first thing Jennifer said.</p><p align="left">“I miss you.” April slurred out. “This isn't fair, we should be together.” </p><p align="left">Jen went silent for a few seconds. “I miss you too, April.” She said, almost relieved, like she had been holding it for too long. </p><p align="left">April could hear a faint noise of arguing on the back of the phone call. “What's going on there?”</p><p align="left">“Oh, my mom and her boyfriend. He asked her to marry him.”</p><p align="left">April inclined against the wall, feeling light headed. “And she is mad about it?”</p><p align="left">“Somehow, yes.” A noise of metal banging against the floor. “Look, I have to go. I'll call you later, ok?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, okay.” April looked at the inside clock through the window. “Hey, it's midnight here. Merry Christmas.”</p><p align="left">Jennifer smiled. “Merry Christmas, honey.” </p><p align="left">She hung up the phone, turning around to see her mother gathering the boyfriend’s belongings and throwing them against him, shoving him outside the door onto the snow.</p><p align="left">“What is it now?” Jennifer asked her.</p><p align="left">“Can you believe his nerve?” She replied. “Marriage? I’m too young for that!”</p><p align="left">Jennifer gaped her mouth in genuine surprise. The woman was nearly sixty already. </p><p align="left">“Mom, that was a stupid thing to do. You have someone who puts up with you enough to want you, and you send them away?”</p><p align="left">“You're one to talk, Jennifer.” Her mother countered, throwing herself on the couch.</p><p align="left">“For your information, I have someone back in Washington.” Jennifer's heart raced with how natural the words came out.</p><p align="left">“And where are they now?” She asked, unbelieved that Jennifer settled down with someone.</p><p align="left">“Well, believe it or not, but some people actually like to spend time with family and friends on Christmas.”</p><p align="left">Jennifer called on April back on the morning of the 25th to wish her a Merry Christmas again. Eartha Kitty’s “Santa Baby” blasted on the back as her mother tried to sing along, drunk at ten in the morning.</p><p align="left">“Think about all the boys I haven't kissed, Jen!” She quoted the song, snuggling with a bottle of champagne.</p><p align="left">April’s sudden laugh on the other side of the phone brought Jen back to reality. “She seems nice.”</p><p align="left">Jen sighed. “She’s like an older version of me, but with fewer screws in her brain.” </p><p align="left">“Well, I already like her, then.”</p><p align="left">Jen bit her lip, trying to contain a smile.</p><p align="left">“Is this the person you told me about, Jennifer?” Her mom asked suddenly, pulling the phone from her hand and putting on her ear. “Hi, how are you? I'm Maya Ann.” </p><p align="left">“Mom!” Jen tried to reach the phone, but her mom turned around.</p><p align="left">“April? That's a lovely name. If you think about it, if you take the last letter of my name, we’re almost month named sisters!” Maya said, laughing more than it would be normal for the terrible joke.</p><p align="left">“Give me that.” Jennifer managed to get the cellphone back, clutching it against her chest.</p><p align="left">“You're no fun, Jen.” Her mom said playfully. “Bring her around sometime, i'll give you some privacy now.” She wiggled her brows and disappeared down the hall.</p><p align="left">Jennifer scoffed and breathed deeply before talking again, feeling more embarrassed than ever. “Sorry about that.”</p><p align="left">“No, don't be. She sounds like a blast.” April said, without sarcasm. </p><p align="left">“How are things going there?”</p><p align="left">“Two of my aunts already told me that God condenes separation, then spiraled about how i didn't got married at a church, another said i didn't find the right man and could introduce me to her friend’s son and my uncle just passed by asking if it was Andy on the phone.” April groaned. “And if I listen to one more Christmas carol i will carve a knife on my chest.” </p><p align="left">“I take it's going well, then.” Jen teased.</p><p align="left">“Absolutely.” April paused, lowering her voice like she was telling a secret when she said; “I can't wait to see you again.” </p><p align="left">Jen suspired, suddenly remembering how much she was already missing April and getting a bit terrified about it. “Me too. I will be back in two days.” </p><p align="left">“Hurry, please.” </p><p align="center">_____</p><p align="left">It was December 27th when April knocked on Jennifer's door, so excited that it was almost impossible to keep her usual uncaring attitude. </p><p align="left">The door wasn't even fully opened yet before Jen pulled her inside by the waist, already bringing their lips together in a way that made both sigh in each other’s mouth. </p><p align="left">“Hi.” April whispered between one kiss and the other, being walked backwards to the room.</p><p align="left">“Hello” Jen said back with a smile, already shoving the girl on the mattress and pulling her shirt off.</p><p align="left">April chuckled with the desperation and hooked one leg on Jen's waist, kissing her hard. Jen was wearing the perfume April had given her and the girl moaned with that, intoxicated with her new smell.</p><p align="left">It wasn't long before they were both naked and Jen was sitting on top of April with lips swollen and hair messy, she was adjusting their legs and thighs at an unusual angle and entanglement, April only understood what was going to happen when Jen lowered herself, holding her waist.</p><p align="left">The first contact between their centers made April moan and shoot up from the bed, gripping the sheets. It was different from everything she had ever done or felt as pleasure.</p><p align="left">“Is this okay?” Jen checked, breathing hard, her hair falling forwards and framing her flushed face.</p><p align="left">April encouraged her to grind forward again, moaning loud with it. She fell back into the mattress, gripping her hips so hard that her bracelet left marks on the skin. "I think i’ll die if you stop.”</p><p align="left">Jen chuckled, lost with lust, grinding her hips against April and moaning deep with the wet and hot contact between them. She closed her eyes, going faster and supporting herself on April's stomach. April was so gone that she wasn't sure what her own name was anymore, beginning to question what she had done to deserve an entry to Heaven. </p><p align="left">Her moans grew louder and Jen's hand sneaked to her neck while she still moved on top, her fingers closing around April's pulse point in a light way, not meaning to harm, but enough to make April almost yell in pleasure.</p><p align="left">April smiled and held Jen's wrist, encouraging her to keep choking.</p><p align="left">“God, you're so weird!” Jen exclaimed with a laugh, coming fast and frantic, losing control of her hips and gushing her liquids on their meeting point, what made April go over the edge and come so hard that her legs shook and her hips shot up, making Jennifer lose balance and fall on top of her. </p><p align="left">They stayed like this for a few seconds, their breathing descompassed and Jen's voluminous hair suffocating them. When she had recovered enough, Jen flopped to the side, hiding her eyes with one hand as she breathed deeply.</p><p align="left">She turned to April, who was already staring at her, and they couldn't help but laugh, light headed with the afterglow and needing to cuddle up against each other, hiding under the covers and talking about their own Holiday adventures.</p><p align="left">That time of year, they found out, wasn't that bad after all. Especially when they sneaked undera mistletoe to kiss at the office’s New Year’s party, and even more when at midnight they were each other's first kiss of the year. </p>
