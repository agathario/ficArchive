<div class="userstuff">
<p>The sun was fucking <em> sweltering </em>.</p><p> </p><p>The heat of it hit Agatha like a second skin the minute the cab door swung open, allowing her to step out onto the <em> White Lotus’ </em>crisp, limestone sidewalk.</p><p> </p><p>Something about Athens in blistering mid-July, mixed with the smell of salt from the Aegean sea down on the coastline, admittedly put Agatha at ease. Her shoulders had been tight since they arrived in Greece – actually, they’d been squared ever since Wanda proposed this… <em> vacation </em>together.</p><p> </p><p>Being engaged at 25, to a woman you’re not even sure you want to marry anymore, can <em> certainly </em> put someone on edge.</p><p> </p><p>“God.” Wanda exhaled from beside her fiancée, sunglasses already on and her voice half-awe, half-exhaustion. “It’s like we stepped into a postcard or something.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to smile. It was faint, didn’t necessarily reach her eyes, which were currently tracking over the sprawling marble entrance of the White Lotus Hotel.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. A really expensive one.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda laughed like it was a compliment. Jesus. </p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t it perfect? We deserve this.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Not because she disagreed — technically, sure, they did deserve a vacation — but the word we had started to feel like a sweater that didn’t quite fit anymore. It was simply <em> too tight at the seams </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda slipped her hand into Agatha’s, lacing their fingers together in the same way she’d been doing for nearly four years.</p><p> </p><p>It should’ve been comfortable. Yet, Agatha found herself wanting to drop it and run away screaming.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she smiled and followed as Wanda began walking them inside.</p><p> </p><p>The lobby of the hotel was almost <em> absurdly </em>beautiful. The ceilings were tall, all draped in muted gold tones and orchids that would’ve probably cost Agatha more than a month’s rent back home. The sea breeze continued to filter in through the open, double-doors they entered through, and a neatly dressed bellhop and a receptionist smiled at them as they approached the counter.</p><p> </p><p>“Miss Maximoff and Miss Harkness, checking in.” Wanda smiled brightly, and the receptionist mirrored it before tapping away at her desktop.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, yes. Miss Maximoff, Miss Harkness, welcome to the White Lotus, Athens.” She said, handing over two hotel keycards tucked away in a leather folder, emboldened with a Lotus flower engraved into the clasp. “You’ll be staying in the Apollonia Suite. One of our finest.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sounds sexy.” Wanda murmured, squeezing Agatha’s hand as she brushed her thumb ever-so gently over her knuckles.</p><p> </p><p>“Hopefully it has air conditioning.”</p><p> </p><p><em> A little mean, sure. </em> But Agatha had earned it at this point – nine hours and thirty-five minutes on a plane, stalled at the gate for an hour, and a forty minute cab ride over to the hotel.</p><p> </p><p>The walk to their suite was long, winding, and for the most part silent – at least for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>This damned hotel was a maze of terraced levels and whitewashed stone, all of it glowing under the evening sun. Planters of pink bougainvillea spilled down the walls, accompanied by the occasional signage saying <em> White Lotus Resort &amp; Spa, Athens. </em></p><p> </p><p>Wanda kept a firm but gentle grip on Agatha’s hand as they walked, their suitcases bumping along the flooring behind them.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, so. First thing tomorrow – breakfast on the terrace. Then I wanna do that walking tour of the old quarter, and after that we can get those couples massages I booked. And maybe swim? Or nap. Or both, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let the words drift past her like it’d been background noise. She was way too busy watching the way the sunlight bounced off the pool tiles down below. Much too busy.</p><p> </p><p>“Mm.” She replied to Wanda, noncommittal-like.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda frowned at that, but she didn’t stop. “And then maybe we dress up and get drinks at the rooftop bar? I saw pictures online, it looks incredible. Plus, we haven’t done a proper date night in, what… forever?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded once, her jaw tight. “Sure. Whatever you want, babe.”</p><p> </p><p>That earned her a sidelong look, one that Wanda didn’t bother to disguise this time. “Okay, what’s going on with you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Too fast. Way too fast. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m tired. It’s just jet lag.” She squeezed Wanda’s hand to try and make it sound more convincing. “Seriously.”</p><p> </p><p>They rounded a corner for the final time and stepped into a sun-drenched hallway, with a little plaque above the archway listing all the suites ahead. Apollonia was the third door down, apparently.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda slowed her pace a little now, her voice dipping into something softer and quieter as she grinned at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“What if we christen the balcony later?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Wanda wasn’t exactly the most adventurous type, and hearing her say that was a genuine shock.</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“You know.” She smiled, looking almost… shy. “You, me, stars. My thighs up over the railing. Just an idea.”</p><p> </p><p>It was the kind of thing Wanda would’ve whispered to her months ago, back when things were easy and physical and fluid. But now it just felt like a line rehearsed too many times.</p><p> </p><p>Still, something in Agatha wanted to <em> try </em>. To force it. She’d agreed to this trip to fix them, hadn’t she?</p><p> </p><p>“That sounds… hot.” She eventually smiled back, and it almost came out right.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled Wanda closer and kissed her, for added effect. Properly, not chaste. And their mouths lingered longer than they had in <em> weeks. </em></p><p> </p><p>When they finally pulled apart, Wanda looked a little breathless. Good.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha realised they’d stopped right outside of their suite – evidenced by the little bronze plaque, etched with <b>Apollonia, </b>beside the door – and swiped the card to let them in.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda let out a small gasp as she took it in; the room was <em> stunning. </em></p><p> </p><p>High vaulted ceilings just like the lobby, white linen drapes, marble floors, and a king-sized bed draped in expensive-looking sheets. Their balcony doors were already flung open, and the view of the sea out ahead was certainly not something to complain about.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda spun around slowly, her arms outstretched with a stupid grin on her face. “Holy shit. I’m obsessed.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wandered toward the bed, musing. There was a bottle of champagne on ice sitting atop the nightstand, with two glasses and a note signed in cursive: <em> Kalos irthate. </em></p><p> </p><p>She turned and ran her fingers along the edge of a dark wooden door. It didn’t match the rest of the suite – older, more worn, with a brass handle and a keyhole, but no key in sight. Agatha frowned at it.</p><p> </p><p>“Is this… some other room?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda flopped onto the bed and stretched. “Maybe it’s one of those old adjoining doors. You know, in case a family books out the other side.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached out and jiggled the handle, but it didn’t budge. Locked. Great.</p><p> </p><p>“Still.” She said, low enough that it was just to herself. “Weird.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda didn’t hear anyways, too occupied now with scrolling through the hotel’s Instagram page, legs kicked up and her ankle bouncing.</p><p> </p><p>She turned away and went to grab the champagne, popping the cork and pouring out the two glasses before picking them up.</p><p> </p><p>“Here.” She mumbled, walking over and passing it down to her fiancée.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda took it, sitting up a little and dropping her legs.</p><p> </p><p>“You sure you’re okay, baby?” She asked, bottom lip pouting at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>She then took it upon herself to lift a hand up to the waistband of Agatha’s beige pants, dipping two fingers into the beltline and tugging, until she stood in between Wanda’s spread legs on the bed.</p><p> </p><p>The move, admittedly, sent a little jolt through Agatha’s stomach.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine. I promise.” Agatha took a sip of her drink, inhaling through her nose when Wanda slid the hand on her pants around her waist and curled around the small of her back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached over to the adjacent nightstand to put her glass down, her own hands coming up to cup Wanda’s jawline, brushing her thumb along those pretty cheekbones of hers.</p><p> </p><p>“You doin’ okay?” She echoed, tilting her head ever-so slightly.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be better if you kiss me.” Wanda whispered, turning her head and pressing a kiss to Agatha’s palm, nibbling at it gently.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Woah. Alright. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha decided, <em>what’s the harm?</em></p><p> </p><p>She bent down and coaxed their lips together, noses slotting beside each other perfectly as Wanda sighed into it. They kissed for a while, much longer than any <strong>pathetic</strong> thing they’d done in the past four weeks, and Agatha let out a surprised hum as she felt Wanda’s tongue snake past her bottom lip.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s gotten into you?” Agatha involuntarily smirked, parting their kiss for a moment before dragging her fiancée back up into it.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda let out a breathy moan as Agatha’s hands slid down her neck to her chest, dipping underneath her flimsy tank top and down to her bra-less tits, squeezing in one hand as the other pulled it down to expose her breasts to the cool air of the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, Agatha… m’feels so good.” She huffed, sounding dazed as Agatha continued to grab and grope like a horny teenage boy, thumbs teasing over her nipples in torturous circles.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t believe it, really – nearly two months of absolutely nothing in the bedroom, not even a quickie before work or dinner or in the shower – and here she was, playing with her fiancée’s nipples and licking into her mouth on a lush, Greek resort.</p><p> </p><p>Then, because of course <em> something </em>had to ruin the moment, soft footfalls from somewhere nearby.</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Click.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>The distinct sound of a latch. A lock turning, and a handle being pulled downward.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shit. Stupid fucking mystery door. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Their heads both snapped to it, watching (in horror, on Wanda’s part) as it began to open from the other side of the wall.</p><p> </p><p>A woman stepped into the room, and Agatha let out a strangled noise of protest, just as Wanda jolted upright and began tearing her shirt back up to cover her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“What the <em> fuck?” </em>She gasped, scrambling off the bed and out from under Agatha’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>This stranger – tall, already tan, mid-thirties maybe – looked just as startled as the couple. She had on a simple, black tank top, linen shorts, and was holding a keycard in one hand, a pair of sunglasses in the other.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes went wide as she registered just exactly it was that she’d walked into.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my God.” She let out, backing up a step with her hands raised, as though she’d just triggered a bomb. “Shit. Oh, shit. I thought this was a closet or something.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda straightened up, whilst Agatha silently stood there, heart hammering in her chest and her mouth dry. “It’s… not a closet.”</p><p> </p><p>“Clearly. The key was just hanging on the handle. I figured – <em> Jesus </em>. I’m really sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha found her voice. “It was locked before.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I, uh… might’ve unlocked it thinking it was stuck. Which was very, <em>very</em> stupid in hindsight.”</p><p> </p><p>The three of them stood there in thick silence for a beat, the air conditioning suddenly loud in the background.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda crossed her arms over her chest. “Okay, well. This is… super awkward. Can we just agree to keep that door locked forever now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” The woman said immediately. “God, yes. I'm mortified. I didn’t see anything, I swear.”</p><p> </p><p>“You saw <em> enough </em>.” Wanda muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally climbed off the bed, smoothing her hair back, trying to summon a voice that didn’t sound like static.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi.” She said, because someone had to say it. “I’m Agatha. That’s Wanda. And… you are?”</p><p> </p><p>The woman hesitated, then gave a sheepish smile. “Rio. Room Alexandria next door, I guess we’re neighbors.”</p><p> </p><p>Another beat of silence.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda looked like she just wanted to vanish into the mattress.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, Rio.” Agatha said, managing the faintest curve of a smile. “Nice to meet you. Kind of.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed — soft, real, unapologetic almost. “Yeah. I’ll go ahead and lock my side now. Sorry again. Have a good night. Or, uh... what’s left of it.”</p><p> </p><p>She closed the door gently behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda let out a long, deflated sigh and flopped back onto the bed, arms splayed wide.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood by the door for a moment longer, hand hovering over the now-silent handle.</p><p> </p><p>From the other side, she thought she heard movement. A laugh. A muffled voice over the phone, perhaps. A drawer sliding open.</p><p> </p><p>She touched the wood once, fingertips brushing the surface.</p><p> </p><p>Then she turned away.</p><p> </p><p>“Balcony’s still an option.” Wanda called from the bed, her voice lighter, trying.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She wasn’t in the mood, not anymore.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck’s sake. </em>

<p>Agatha stood in front of the mirror, contemplating all decisions leading up to this vacation.</p><p> </p><p>Well, not every decision. Just the ones involved when she'd begrudgingly packed her suitcase forty-eight hours before their flight was scheduled.</p><p> </p><p>She turned this way and that, patting her cheeks lightly as though it might bring the colour back into them. Her skin looked… tired. Her eyes, blank, and she’d changed her outfit four times already, and it’d only been twenty minutes since she’d tamed her hair into less-wild, still-natural curls.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Agatha let out a sigh that sounded more like a huff – she’d have to settle for the basics. Loose, waist-high black trousers, a white button-down with the sleeves rolled to her elbows, collar open just enough to make it clear she didn’t have a bra on underneath. She layered them with an array of gold ear accessories in the left, a matching gold hoop in the right, and the Three Goddesses locket she never took off (<em>ever</em>) remained around her neck.</p><p> </p><p>“You like the red, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, Wanda was spinning slowly in front of the open closet, debating between two dresses — one a floral maxi, the other a tighter, deep red dress. She looked good in both. She always did.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s nice.” Agatha said.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda turned around and raised an eyebrow. “Nice? You used to say this one was hot.”</p><p> </p><p>“It is hot.” Agatha said, adjusting her collar and stepping away from the mirror. “It’s just... dinner. You don’t need to overthink it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not overthinking.” Wanda said too quickly. “I’m trying to look nice for you. You’re allowed to say I look good, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned against the dresser and watched her. “You look good.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda stared at her for a second longer, then turned back to the mirror. “Whatever. Let’s just go.”</p><p> </p><p>The sun had gone down significantly by now, dusk settling in the gorgeous skyline above the sea as they walked out of their room and through the hotel’s hallways over to the restaurant. It was a beautiful spread – pillars lit with golden sconces, tiny candles situated in the centre of each table. Outside, the terrace opened up to the view of the Aegean, sparkling faintly and looking like something plucked right out of a tourism advertisement.</p><p> </p><p>The nicely-dressed waiter seated Wanda and Agatha down near the balcony edge, a four-seater draped in white linen similar enough to the fabric of their bedsheets.</p><p> </p><p>“Glass of red, please.” Agatha ordered, absentmindedly playing with the ring on her left hand, zoning out as Wanda ordered a cocktail for herself.</p><p> </p><p>Drinks arrived quickly – Agatha briefly took notice of how ridiculously vacation-y Wanda’s drink looked; pink and frothy, with a slice of pineapple stuck into the rim. But she quickly entertained herself by taking a swig of the (unsurprisingly rich) wine in hand and staring out at the view.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda stirred her drink for a few seconds with the paper straw, then looked up at her fiancée with a frown.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, let’s not be weird.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “I’m not being weird.”</p><p> </p><p>“You haven’t looked me in the eye in half an hour.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m literally looking at you right now.”</p><p> </p><p>She dropped the straw, drained. “Do you want to be here, Agatha? Like, <em> really </em>want to? With me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down into her wine glass, rolling the stem between her fingers, contemplative.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re here, aren’t we?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not an answer.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m trying, okay? I’m here. I said yes to this trip, didn’t I?”</p><p> </p><p>“You also said yes when I proposed.” Wanda said quietly, almost like she’d regretted it the moment it came out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha physically and mentally flinched. Her voice dropped, something unnameable lacing her voice. “Don’t do that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not doing anything.” Wanda said, a touch too loudly. “I’m just… I need to know that you’re not still punishing me.”</p><p> </p><p>A stilted, <em> thick </em>silence fell between them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away, and her jaw flexed. “I said I forgave you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You said it, yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>“I meant it.” Agatha said. “But I can’t just snap my fingers and forget that you—”</p><p> </p><p>She stopped herself, but it was too late. Wanda’s expression shifted, lips tightening, eyes going glossy with that familiar regret and agony.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice faltered. She still didn’t want to hurt Wanda, even now, even after what she’d done.</p><p> </p><p>“Forget what happened.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda leaned back in her chair, staring at the ocean like it had betrayed her. “It was one time.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t need to.</p><p> </p><p>And then? Salvation. In the form of a familiar face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha spotted her first, walking into the restaurant behind a hostess. Rio was wearing a white, cut-out minidress with buttons lining up the sides of the torso. It fit her <em> stupidly </em> well; showing off the beautiful length of her legs, the toned muscles in her arms, the pinch in her waistline – again, <em> stupidly good-looking.  </em></p><p> </p><p>And next to her was a woman – much shorter, mid-thirties herself, and pale with messy, dyed bangs and wearing a pantsuit that sat nicely on her. She was mid-laughter, covering her mouth from something Rio had just said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach gave the slightest twist.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Whatever. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio noticed them just a second later, due to the fact that the hostess was currently directing them to the table right across from Agatha and Wanda.</p><p> </p><p>She paused at her own table, giving the couple a little wave.</p><p> </p><p>“Evening.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda turned, recognizing her instantly. “Oh my god. Closet girl.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed. “Please never call me that again.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman beside her raised a brow. “I’m missing a story, clearly.”</p><p> </p><p>“This is Agatha and Wanda.” Rio explained, gesturing to them. “We’re… uh, adjoining room survivors. They’re why I hid that key I found in the nightstand.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sounds intimate. And I’m Alice.” She added, extending a hand toward Wanda, who shook it eagerly.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you two… together?” Agatha found herself blurting out, wanting to take it back immediately afterward.</p><p> </p><p>The question came out faster than she intended — sharp-edged, a little too pointed for <em> strangers-slash-neighbors. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced at Alice, then smirked. “Nope. Just friends. Travel buddies.”</p><p> </p><p>“Platonic life partners, if you will.” Alice added, dramatically toasting her wine glass to no one.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s face brightened, sliding back into her typical charm mode. “Well, we were just about to order food. Why don’t you two join us?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. “Are we?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda kicked her foot gently under the table.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked between them, a flicker of hesitation crossing her face before she smiled. “Sure. Why not.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice slid into the seat next to Wanda, Rio settling beside Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>A waiter appeared to take Rio and Alice’s drink orders – a beer for Alice, a matching glass of red with Agatha for Rio – and Wanda couldn’t’ve been quicker to launch into some conversation with Alice as if they were old friends.</p><p> </p><p>Rio quickly took the opportunity to lean slightly toward Agatha, murmuring quiet enough as to not interrupt the other conversation taking place.</p><p> </p><p>“For the record, I really am sorry about earlier.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio, lips curling upward enough that it was noticeable. “You didn’t exactly catch us at our best.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned back at her. “No. But you looked good.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the words land like warm oil onto her skin, the kind you put into a bubble bath to relax – unexpected, yet slow-burning deliciously.</p><p> </p><p>She looked down at her wine again.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p> </p><p>Food orders were taken quickly, and it arrived even quicker in a flurry of plates – grilled octopus with lemon, roasted red pepper hummus, dolmades, and lamb skewers stacked beside charred pita.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda bit into a skewer, letting out a downright theatrical moan as she took Agatha’s hand in her own without warning. “I’m <em> so </em> glad we did this. This whole trip, this whole dinner. I needed this.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, or at least stretched her mouth into the shape of one. “Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>She poked half-heartedly at her plate, mind already drifting. </p><p> </p><p>She’d kill to be upstairs with a cigarette, curled into the balcony lounger under the stars, silence like a blanket around her. Instead, she was here, the food on her plate going cold as conversation bounced around her like a fucking pinball machine.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda was in full host mode, charming and laughing and reaching for the bottle of wine to refill Alice’s glass politely.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.” Alice said suddenly, snapping her out of the reverie. “You’re kind of the quiet one, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. “Just tired.”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s not a big talker.” Wanda offered, with a tone that tried to make it sound like a cute personality trait. “She likes to observe.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a long sip of her wine. “I’m sitting right here.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda ignored it. She instead launched into a story about their taxi driver from earlier — how he’d insisted on blasting <em> ABBA </em>the entire ride and asked if they were on their honeymoon.</p><p> </p><p>“We didn’t correct him.” Wanda giggled. “I mean, when in Greece, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“God, that reminds me of the time that bartender in Colorado thought <em> we </em>were a couple.” Alice laughed heartily, slapping Rio’s shoulder as she too chuckled along with the story. “Sam was so pissed, and I couldn’t stop laughing about it for, like, the whole night.”</p><p> </p><p>“Who’s Sam?” Wanda asked, fitting in with the conversation so smoothly, so easily.</p><p> </p><p>“My ex.” Rio sighed, rolling her eyes, making it obvious it was a relationship she wasn’t necessarily proud of.</p><p> </p><p>“He not a good guy?” Agatha tried to chime in with, swilling her drink around in feigned nonchalance.</p><p> </p><p>Rio seemed amused by the statement at first. She sucked on her teeth, tongue poking at the inside of her cheek, before she spoke again.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>She </em>was an asshole, yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait. You’re both..?”</p><p> </p><p>Alice gave her finger-guns. “Bi. But I don’t <em> date </em>guys anymore, so.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio just said one word, nodding. “Lesbian.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh.”</p><p> </p><p>“You thought I was straight?” Rio asked, raising a brow.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t really think about it.” Agatha lied.</p><p> </p><p>“But you said ‘him’. When Alice mentioned my ex, I mean.”</p><p> </p><p>“I just… assumed, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really?” Alice seemed the most scandalised out of the two, raising a brow herself. “I mean – look at her. How do you mistake Rio for straight?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered, shoving Alice’s shoulder half-heartedly. “Let the woman live.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know. Sam just sounded like a guy's name.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, locking eyes with Agatha for a beat too long. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m a lesbian. Couldn’t you… tell, or something?”</p><p> </p><p>“I guess not.”</p><p> </p><p>At that, Rio just shrugged and leaned back in her seat.</p><p> </p><p>Conversation drifted eventually — Alice talking about a dive bar they’d gone to in Santorini, Wanda explaining how she and Agatha met at a mutual friend’s birthday (that kind of sugar-coated version of the story that made it sound easier than it had been.)</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha couldn’t stop noticing the curve of Rio’s jaw when she laughed. The shape of her hands as she picked up her wine glass, the dexterity of her fingers curling around the curve. The way she leaned back, listening with full attention, like she knew how rare it was for someone to feel truly heard by another person.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s thoughts drifted without permission.</p><p> </p><p>What would she sound like?</p><p> </p><p>In bed, she meant.</p><p> </p><p>Would she be quiet at first, or would she say things? Would she talk Agatha through it? Would she be a whimperer, make pretty little noises in the back of her throat, or maybe a moaner, be loud and unapologetic–</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked hard. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> What the fuck? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She cleared her throat, then reached for her glass and knocked back the rest of her wine like it might exorcise the thought from her skull.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda leaned in to her fiancée, smiling brightly. “You want another?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked at her, just for a second, and Agatha wasn’t sure — but she thought she saw something flicker behind those eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Amusement, maybe. </p><p> </p><p>Interest, certainly. </p><p> </p><p>The kind of look you throw across a bar when you’re trying to decide if someone’s worth the trouble.</p><p> </p><p>She looked away quickly.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t <em> want </em>this.</p><p> </p><p>She had Wanda. She had a ring. A plan. A room upstairs with a balcony that she’d booked with her <em> fiancée, </em> a railing that her <em> fiancée </em>wanted to get fucked up against.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio spoke up again, of course.</p><p> </p><p>“Anyone smoke?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was already halfway out of her seat. “Yes.”</p>

<em> “Anyone smoke?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha was already halfway out of her seat. “Yes.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Wanda blinked at her. “You’re eager.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha avoided the statement.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s check it out.”</p><p> </p><p>“Now this is the part of dinner I was looking forward to.” Alice stood, already fishing her vape from her pocket. </p><p> </p><p>Rio led the way, and the four of them stepped into the smoking nook, the door closing with a soft click behind them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved to the farthest seat and sat, crossing one leg over the other. Rio pulled out a slim, half-empty pack of cigarettes and offered her one. She thanked her and took it, watching as Rio lit her own first, then leaned over and lit the tip of Agatha’s, cupping a hand over the flame.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda, clearly tipsy by now, spun around a little as she and Alice giggled at something. Then, she plopped herself down right into Agatha’s lap.</p><p> </p><p>“Missed you.” She hummed, nuzzling her face against Agatha’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a small huff of laughter, startled by the sudden contact, but rested a hand on Wanda’s thigh anyway. It reminded her of early days – being wrapped up in one another, Agatha wearing Wanda like an accessory when they went out together.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re drunk.”</p><p> </p><p>“And you’re warm.” Wanda purred, kissing the arc of her jaw. “Perfect match.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice slumped into a nearby chair, puffing on her vape as Rio eyed it like it personally offended her (it did).</p><p> </p><p>“Still can’t believe you brought that neon plastic inhaler to Greece.” She grimaced.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s lavender peach. Don’t knock it ‘til you try it.” Alice replied coolly, exhaling a long stream of smoke.</p><p> </p><p>“Vaping is like dating someone who says they ‘don’t believe in labels.’ All the performance, none of the soul.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice snorted. “Yeah, well, this ‘no-label’ helped me quit cigarettes, so maybe keep your metaphors to yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>“Liar, you never even smoked cigarettes before you bought that thing!” Rio scoffed, blowing right into her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Piss off, Vidal.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled around her cigarette. She liked this part – the way it didn’t feel like small talk anymore. She <em> hated </em>small talk. The alcohol had softened the edges of the group, making them all a little quieter – just the way Agatha liked it. </p><p> </p><p>Even Wanda had gone quieter in her lap, her cheek pressed lazily against Agatha’s collarbone, tracing nonsense patterns into her arm with a fingertip. And for once in nearly two, whole, long months, Agatha didn’t feel like it was fake or performative. It felt… nice.</p><p> </p><p>“So.” Alice said, pointing lazily with her vape. “What’s your guys’ verdict on Athens so far?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda perked up. “I’m obsessed. It’s magic here.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a slow drag. “It’s fine.”</p><p> </p><p>“Just fine?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s beautiful. But I don’t really care where I am. It’s all the same if your head’s not in the right place.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded like she understood. “True. You can be in paradise and still feel like you’re underwater.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Alright. Not about to lift that rock up. Nope. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Wanda stirred suddenly, stretching with a little groan. “I need the bathroom. Where is it?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll go with you.” Alice said, already rising. “Pretty sure I saw it on the way in.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda pressed a quick kiss to Agatha’s cheek, then slid off her lap, a bit unsteady on her feet. “Don’t smoke too many while I’m gone.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave a noncommittal noise in response, already slyly reaching for another.</p><p> </p><p>The murmur of the restaurant was distant now, the glass walls catching warped reflections of flickering candles. Agatha exhaled smoke and watched it curl toward the open ceiling, aware of how much quieter everything suddenly felt now that Alice and Wanda had disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tapped ash into the tray, legs out in a manspread that seemed instinctual.</p><p> </p><p>“She seems sweet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gestured toward the fresh cigarette in her mouth, signalling for Rio to light it, <em> please</em>. “She is.”</p><p> </p><p>A pause. Rio flicked up the case on her lighter, brought the yellow flame to the tip of Agatha’s cigarette, and flicked it back shut without a word.</p><p> </p><p>“But?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose. “No ‘but.’”</p><p> </p><p>The quiet returned. Not for long, but Agatha revelled in it as much as humanly possible.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally broke the silence after a few moments, eyes flickering sideways. “You’re not what I expected.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cocked a brow, exhaling slowly. “Oh? What were you expecting?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know.” Rio said. “Something colder. Or more… I don’t know. Straight-laced.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed softly. “You broke into my room during foreplay. Not exactly a normal meet-cute, hm?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned. “Not mad about it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Neither am I.” Agatha admitted. “But I was kind of banking on having sex tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head. “With your fiancée?”</p><p> </p><p>“Who else?”</p><p> </p><p>For some reason, she found herself laughing at that. Then, she pointed right at Agatha with the end of her cigarette, adjusting in her seat ever-so slightly.</p><p> </p><p>“She your first girlfriend? Or have there been others, a trail of broken hearts left behind perchance?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not my first.” Agatha shook her head. “When I was twenty, I was a full-blown fuckboy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Cocky. Drunk. Horny. Pretty much all three at once, all the time. I’d fuck girls in my class, in my building, in the nearby sorority – anything, really. Most of my mornings in college consisted of me sleeping with a girl, passing out at hers, and forgetting her name by the morning.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Classy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Naturally.” Agatha grinned. This time, a genuine one.</p><p> </p><p>“What changed?”</p><p> </p><p>“Got tired of waking up in strange beds. Met Wanda, got into a relationship. Grew up, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed. “Still... there’s something charming about that kind of reckless phase.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in a little, grinning. “You saying you missed out?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I didn’t miss anything.” Rio replied. “I had my fair share.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave her a once-over. “Yeah, I can tell.”</p><p> </p><p>“But you know what I liked even more than the sex?”</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“The lead-up. The tension. The flirting. The nights where you can feel it building and building, and no one’s saying anything out loud yet... but you both know how it’s gonna end.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed. Something about the way she said it made her stomach flip-flop.</p><p> </p><p>“You like the anticipation.” She offered in a sorta-question tone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “I like drawing it out. I like watching women squirm. I like knowing I could have someone if I wanted to… but waiting. Making her want it more.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised her brows. “You sound like a tease.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am.” Rio said easily, flicking ash into the tray. “But only when I know it’ll drive a girl crazy.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her thighs tighten instinctively, a rush of heat pooling low in her stomach. </p><p> </p><p><em> Jesus, </em> <b> <em>fuck</em></b><em>. Reign it in, Harkness. </em></p><p> </p><p>She took a quick drag of her cigarette to hide it, but her hands had gone slightly unsteady.</p><p> </p><p>“You always on top?” She asked, attempting to sound casual.</p><p> </p><p>Rio met her eyes and tilted her head. “Yeah, mostly.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha waited.</p><p> </p><p>“But don’t get it twisted. I like giving up control.” Rio said, her voice lower now, slower. “I like the part where someone’s got all the power. I like to have it too, on occasion, but I definitely prefer the former. Where I can stop thinking. Just... follow orders, fuck a girl just how she likes it. It’s when I enjoy the sex most, really.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Her mouth was suddenly dry.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, fuck.” She muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile widened — just a little. </p><p> </p><p>Not smug. But she’d seen the effect her words had, and she wasn’t backing down.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away, letting the smoke blur her vision and sting at her eyes. She could feel her pulse in her throat, in her fingertips, in her <em> panties</em>, for God’s sake.</p><p> </p><p>“Guess I got the answer I was looking for.”</p><p> </p><p>“Guess so.”</p><p> </p><p>Another pause.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio continued, her voice softer this time. “Your fiancée’s taking a while.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “Yeah. She does that. Gets distracted. Probably telling Alice her whole life story in the bathroom mirror or something.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stubbed out her cigarette, then leaned back, stretching again like a cat. “Don’t worry. I’m a very patient woman.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha flicked ash into the tray, eyes locked on her. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>Of course, that was the moment Alice and Wanda decided to return.</p><p> </p><p>“There you are.” Wanda said, her voice a little slurred, a little sing-song. “Were you two solving the world’s problems without us?”</p><p> </p><p>“Something like that.” Rio mused.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda grabbed Agatha’s hand and gave it a squeeze, then another, then leaned in to whisper far too loudly in her ear.</p><p> </p><p>“You smell like expensive tobacco.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just laughed, brushing Wanda’s hair back behind her ear.</p><p> </p><p>Alice stretched and patted Rio’s arm. “I’m wiped. Shall we?”</p><p> </p><p>She nodded. “Thanks for the company.”</p><p> </p><p> “We’ll do it again, yeah?” Wanda beamed.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.” Alice said. “Definitely. I gotta hear more stories about Darcy, she sounds crazy.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda laughed heartily, hanging off Agatha’s arm as she and Alice exchanged their own goodbye, a little sleepy and wine-laced. Rio offered her a final glance, unable to disguise some lingering interest, before giving her a small smile and following Alice out of the nook.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda began tugging Agatha somewhere else, toward the elevators and now barefoot, heels dangling from her fingers. They reached the suite in a matter of minutes, and the quiet inside of it felt less relaxing than before, a little more… expectant.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched as her fiancée dropped the heels in a random corner, and turned to Agatha with one of those smiles; the charming, otherworldly-beautiful kind, as she slipped her arms around Agatha’s waist.</p><p> </p><p>“You looked really hot tonight, baby.” She mumbled, to herself mostly.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean it. You look so <em> good </em>in trousers. You’ve got that… what’s it called? ‘Handsome lesbian’ vibe going on.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “Thanks again?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda laughed and kissed her neck, gently at first, then firmer. Her hands wandered down her back, slipping right underneath the waistband. “Let me show you how hot you are.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha found herself melting into it easily, casually — she slid her own hands up Wanda’s stomach, playing with the front string of her dress as she licked into her mouth, swallowing her moans. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda began stripping Agatha’s button-down, fingers undoing them with practiced ease. Her mouth was warm and familiar against Agatha’s, her breathing fast. And for the first time in weeks, Agatha let herself respond properly, believe it’d go somewhere — her hands gripped Wanda’s hips, guiding her backward toward the bed.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s shirt was gone in seconds, tossed somewhere near the dresser, her bra unclasped and forgotten. Her tits spilled out, unbidden and gorgeous, like they <em> had been </em> this whole dry spell but Agatha had been so guiltily neglecting. Her nipples were hard with anticipation, begging for a reprieve, and Agatha gave it to them with a bow of her head. She sucked on the left, playing with the right in her hands, and Wanda moaned filthily.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled Agatha down on top of her, legs parted instinctively, and whispered. </p><p> </p><p>“Please.”</p><p> </p><p>Their kiss deepened from then on out. Wanda’s hands roamed; her hips arched up to meet Agatha’s, her voice was breathy. </p><p> </p><p>“God, I missed this. Missed <em> you</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha tried. She tried to stay grounded, to be here, now, in this body, with this woman who loved her. But her mind was flickering like an old film reel — tattered but legible, that low rasp of Rio’s voice:</p><p> </p><p>
<em> I like giving up control. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She tried not to think about it; shook it from her thoughts. She tried instead to focus on slipping two of her fingers into Wanda’s mouth, coating them in her spit, calling her a <em> good girl, </em> before dipping between her thighs and plunging them inside of her.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda moaned underneath her, pulling her in deeper, eyes fluttering shut. Agatha began to thrust; slippery, poised pushing of her fingers in a rhythmic in-and-out motion. Her thumb strayed towards Wanda’s clit, muscle memory taking over and reminding Agatha how Wanda likes it – slow, circular, a lot of pressure.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s it… mmm, <em>don’t stop</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>But all Agatha could hear then was Rio saying, <em> I can stop thinking. Just... follow orders, pleasure a girl just how she likes it. </em></p><p> </p><p>She moved harder, faster — chasing the image, not the feeling. Pumped her arm back and forth, fucking Wanda hard and fast, filling the room with the obscene noises of wet, slurp-like noises. It was like running on instinct; she'd done this a hundred times before. She knew what she was doing. And she knew Wanda liked it, so that should be enough... right?</p><p> </p><p>Even then, Agatha imagined the sounds Rio would make. </p><p> </p><p>How she’d arch her back into Agatha’s touch. How she’d taste when Agatha had her head between her legs.</p><p> </p><p>Then, like a bolt of lightning, Agatha found her mind drifting to the roles in reverse.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Herself; whimpering, moaning, begging for more, lay beneath Rio’s upright body. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio’s long, dextrous fingers pumping into her – matching the pace she currently had set inside of Wanda. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio’s arm, muscles flexing with the effort of her movements – Agatha’s fingernails digging into the skin there, matching the way Wanda was clinging to her biceps for dear life. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio’s voice in her ear, her grunts and groans of exertion… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She hated herself for it.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda gasped then, fingers curling in the sheets and the meat of Agatha’s arm, her thighs trembling as she came with a shout, eyes squeezed shut in ecstasy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes were open the entire time.</p><p> </p><p>She collapsed beside her after, chest heaving, sweat-dampened and flushed. Wanda curled into Agatha’s side like nothing was wrong (to her, nothing was, of course), nuzzling her shoulder, still humming with leftover pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>“That was so fucking good.” She sighed, pleasure inked in her tone. “God, I needed that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, brushing damp hair from Wanda’s forehead in an attempt to ground herself.</p><p> </p><p>But her stomach was tight with guilt. With longing.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Christ. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>And when Wanda finally drifted off — barely two minutes later, breath soft and steady — Agatha lay there and stared at the ceiling for a long, long time.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The next morning unfolded in a total blur.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha woke up spooning Wanda; an occurrence that had been unheard of between them in the last four months, approximately. Wanda was curled up in her arms, warm and half-asleep, already pressing lazy kisses to Agatha’s arms before Agatha could even register where she was.</p><p> </p><p>That led to the sex on the balcony. Just like Wanda had proposed.</p><p> </p><p>The sun was barely up; Wanda sitting atop the railing, Agatha on her knees in front of her, muttering absentminded, sweet filth into Wanda’s cunt as she laved over her slit, up to her clit, and sucked on it until Wanda had to tug Agatha’s head away by her hair.</p><p> </p><p>But it didn’t stop there.</p><p> </p><p>Again. In the shower.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda had suggested doing it together – “it’ll save time, that way we can head down to the beach earlier” – stripping off her underwear and stepping through the glass doors.</p><p> </p><p>She looked so good. So utterly perfect; water sliding down her slick body, highlighting every curve and bump and delicious expanse of skin.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda was an objectively attractive woman. Agatha was only human. And, you know, engaged to be wed to her.</p><p> </p><p>She remembered hearing Wanda’s laughter between kisses, breathless and light, remembered the moans she let out when Agatha’d pressed her into the tile, kept a hand on her hip as she thrust three fingers into her pussy from behind.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t wanted to stop either time. Not once.</p><p> </p><p>But every time, it felt a little like she was trying to drown <em>something</em> in pleasure – to replace it (whatever <em>it</em> was) with a flurry of gasps and whines and the taste of a woman’s slick in her mouth. Every orgasm she coaxed out of her fiancée came with a fresh wave of guilt.</p><p> </p><p>And now, post-shower, Wanda stood in front of the mirror, humming as she rubbed lotion into her arms, glowing and clear-as-day drunk on love.</p><p> </p><p>She turned to Agatha with a smile so open it made her chest tighten – with what, Agatha was still uncertain.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you.” Wanda said, sliding her arms around her waist, still damp, still smelling like coconut and body wash.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss to her temple. “I love you too.”</p><p> </p><p>She hoped it sounded true.</p><p> </p><p>They continued to dress for the beach while the sun shone down through their windows, bathing the entire room in warmth and gold.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda pulled on a stunning black one-piece with a plunging neckline and high-cut hips, her curves poured into it like something out of a fashion editorial. Her sunglasses were oversized, her hair tossed up in a messy bun that somehow made her look even more put-together. She tied a silk scarf around her waist like a makeshift sarong and turned to look at herself in the mirror.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled. “Obviously.”</p><p> </p><p>Her own swimsuit was less flashy, more her speed — a sleek, dark purple two-piece with a structured top and mid-waisted bottoms, less expensive-looking than Wanda’s entire fit, but fashionista nonetheless. She threw on a linen button-down over it and left it open intentionally.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda slipped her hand into Agatha’s as they headed out the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s go find a spot down on the sand.”</p><p> </p><p>The walk down to the coastline was only a mere five minutes from their room, and it glimmered in the distance, just past the palm-lined path into the private sector of the beach owned by the hotel.</p><p> </p><p>Sand everywhere was white and hot underfoot, decorated only by the occasional umbrella and rows of sun loungers faced toward the sea. A number of hotel guests were already there, sunbathing, reading, tanning, napping, listening to music – all simply going about their lives, just like Agatha was trying to.</p><p> </p><p>“God, this place.” Wanda sighed, her voice reverent. “How are we ever supposed to leave?”</p><p> </p><p>As if summoned by the universe’s twisted sense of humour, a voice called out from nearby.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, if it isn’t the honeymooners!”</p><p> </p><p>They turned to find Alice reclining beneath a canvas umbrella, long legs stretched out, book in hand, wide-brimmed hat shading most of her face. She sat up with a grin and waved.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey! Come join us!”</p><p> </p><p>Beside her — of course, <em> of course </em> — was Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her stomach dip. Like a trapdoor opening under her ribcage.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was sprawled in a lounge chair, sunglasses perched on her nose, an unread magazine resting against her thigh. Her swimsuit was a dark green two-piece that looked almost criminal on her. The top clung to her like it was made for her chest alone, the bottom high on her hips and low on her waist, framing her body in ways that made Agatha forget how breathing worked for a second.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her mouth go dry.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Do NOT fucking think about it. Do NOT think about peeling the suit off. DO NOT, HARKNESS. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.” Wanda said brightly, tugging her toward the chairs. “Come on!”</p><p> </p><p>She blinked herself back to reality and forced a smile, her skin already overheating from something that had nothing to do with the sun.</p><p> </p><p>They laid out their towels, Wanda immediately flopping down beside Alice to complain about the heat. Agatha took the seat beside Rio, careful not to let their bare arms touch.</p><p> </p><p>“Morning.” Rio said, tilting her head toward her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed. “Morning.”</p><p> </p><p>She watched as Rio brought a bottle of water from out of her bag to her lips and drank, her throat bobbing with every swallow. Her skin was utterly radiant, glistening slightly, and Agatha had to drag her gaze away before it became obvious she'd just gotten aroused from that fact.</p><p> </p><p>“You guys are up early.” Alice said, glancing over her sunglasses.</p><p> </p><p>“We got distracted.” Wanda said, winking.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled, slow. She could feel Rio glance sideways at her.</p><p> </p><p>“This place makes me so horny, it’s insane.” Wanda continued, stretching on her lounger with a smirk.</p><p> </p><p>Alice laughed. “It’s the Mediterranean. Does something to people.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m serious.” She said, tossing her head to look at Agatha. “Three times this morning. Right, baby?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha forced a laugh, cheeks flushing. “Yeah. She’s insatiable.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t dare look at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Not when her body was still humming with guilt. Not when the image of Rio in that green bikini kept flashing through her mind, each time with fewer clothes, more breathless sounding, more imagined skin against her own.</p><p> </p><p>She leaned back in her chair, sunglasses hiding her eyes, and tried to focus on the ocean.</p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, it’s too gorgeous out not to swim.” Alice groaned, already sliding off her lounger. “You guys coming?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda perked up immediately, tossing her sunglasses into the sand and adjusting her top. “Thought you’d never ask.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio just shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine here, thanks.” Agatha shrugged, unmoving in her lounger.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched as the two of them wandered down toward the water, kicking up little clouds of sand behind them. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda glanced back once with a flirtatious grin, blowing Agatha a kiss before turning back to Alice and splashing into the crystal-clear water.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look after them. She waited a beat, then tilted her head toward Agatha, speaking low and deliberate.</p><p> </p><p>“You always tense up like that when she calls you ‘baby.’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“You bristle. Just a little. Every time.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, resting her head against the back of the lounger. </p><p> </p><p>“It didn’t used to bother me.” She admitted. “It was cute, I guess. Familiar. But lately…”</p><p> </p><p>She trailed off after that, shaking her head.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in just enough for her voice to drop an octave. “Lately something changed.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha acquiesced. “And I don’t even know what. It’s like there’s this wall now, between what she thinks we are and what I feel when I look at her.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a shitty place to be.”</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me about it.”</p><p> </p><p>They sat in silence for a beat, the sounds of distant laughter and surf filling the space. Agatha shifted in her chair, feeling suddenly too warm under her shirt, too bare in her own skin. What was she doing, baring her problems to a total stranger?</p><p> </p><p>Twenty-year-old Agatha Harkness would strangle her for even daring to put her trust in another person.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced sideways again, casually, almost as if she were talking about the weather. </p><p> </p><p>“So, last night. <em> And </em>this morning.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned to her, brows raised.</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda’s not exactly subtle, is she?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned and covered her face with one hand. “<em> Jesus </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“No judgment, none at all. I can’t stress that enough.” Rio added, stretching her legs. “Just... surprised. Three times, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha said, drawing the word out. “All me, baby. Like — as in, me giving.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio arched a brow, intrigued now. “Every single time?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“And when’s the last time <em> you </em>got taken care of?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s, uh, not really Wanda’s style. She’s not a pillow princess, but she prefers it that way. I do too.”</p><p> </p><p>“You do?” Rio pressed, sounding almost unconvinced.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed again.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> That is what she prefers, right? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.” Rio nodded, drawing the word out as she sat up in her lounger. “But she still fucks you, on occasion. When… was the last <em> occasion </em>?”</p><p> </p><p>The question came so easily. Agatha looked down at her knees, then out at the water. </p><p> </p><p>“I… don’t remember.” She muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a low, thoughtful hum. “That’s tragic.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why’s that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged, smiling faintly. “I don’t know. There’s just something about it. Giving. Pleasing someone until they fall apart in your hands.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach fluttered. “You say that like it’s… a mission or something.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed softly. </p><p> </p><p>“Maybe it is. I like losing myself in it. I like being told what to do — being taught someone’s body like a new language. The more specific she is, the more control she takes? The better it is for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. Her thighs pressed a little closer together, instinctively.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess I thought you’d be more… I don’t know. Dominant.” She said, trying to sound casual, teasing. “You give that energy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, don’t get me wrong,” Rio said, turning to face her fully now, eyes shaded by her sunglasses, but her mouth twisting into a grin. </p><p> </p><p>“I can be. If I have to. But there’s something addictive about getting on my knees for a woman who knows exactly what she wants. Not just sexually — like, in general. I love women who take their time. Who tell me where to go, what to do, how hard or soft, how fast or slow. It’s not passive. It’s <em> worship </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her.</p><p> </p><p>The word cracked something open in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m… not used to that.” She admitted, voice quieter. “Most of the time, it’s just me doing and me deciding. Me figuring everything out.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed. “Sounds exhausting.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes it is.”</p><p> </p><p>“You ever think about just letting go?” Rio asked. “Letting Wanda ‘learn you’, if that’s how we’re putting it? Not just to make you come — but to actually make you feel?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught slightly. Her lips parted like she was going to say something, but she didn’t know what.</p><p> </p><p>“I like the buildup.” Rio continued, eyes locked on her now.</p><p> </p><p>“You mentioned last night.”</p><p> </p><p>She laughed, nodding and continuing on.</p><p> </p><p>“The tease, the wait. That moment before I even touch her — when I know she’s already wet. That anticipation? <em> That’s </em> what ruins me. She could be completely still, but if her eyes are screaming for it… <em> fuck </em>, that’s enough.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t look at her. </p><p> </p><p>She was too aware of her own pulse, too aware of how her body had begun reacting on its own. Her mouth felt dry. Her skin too hot. She felt like her centre of gravity had tilted slightly off-balance, like she might fall into something if she wasn’t careful.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry.” Rio added, laughing softly. “I have a tendency to overshare when the sun’s out and I’m two margaritas deep.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, quickly.</p><p> </p><p>She decided not to bring up the fact that drinks weren't even served until 2pm... it was currently 11am.</p><p> </p><p>“No, it’s fine. I…” She forced a laugh. “I just wasn’t expecting any of that.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re blushing.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am not.”</p><p> </p><p>“You are.” Rio said, almost gleeful now.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>She laughed heartily, and Agatha briefly joined in. They quieted down after a moment, and Rio didn’t hesitate to speak up again, picking up right where she’d left off.</p><p> </p><p>“You know what I think? I think you’ve been craving it. Not the sex, exactly — but the care. The kind that feels selfish. The kind where you can just unravel and still get everything you want, everything you need, y’know?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t speak.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Couldn’t is probably a better word for it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her heart was in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio’s voice dropped, soft and starkly sugar-sweet.</p><p> </p><p>“I bet you look fucking gorgeous when you come.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s inhale was sharp, barely audible. But she felt it all the way down in her panties.</p><p> </p><p>Heat pooled between her legs, slow and steady, innards of her thighs now slick with arousal. She turned her head just enough to catch Rio’s expression — teasing, of course, but some severity wedged in there too.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, <em> finally </em>, the subject changed for good.</p><p> </p><p>“I wanna show you something.”</p>

<em> Finally, finally, the subject changed for good. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I wanna show you something.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Now?” Agatha said, a little nervous laugh escaping her.</p><p> </p><p>“Unless you’re scared of a little underwater adventure.” Rio smirked. </p><p> </p><p>“What kind of adventure are we talking about?” She asked, trying to keep her tone neutral. </p><p> </p><p><em> Failing to, might I add </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pointed out toward the rocks lining the far end of the beach. </p><p> </p><p>“There’s a cave system — natural rock pools. You’ve got to swim through this narrow arch underwater to get in. But once you’re there, it’s magic.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitated, mostly because her body was still reeling from their last conversation that’d taken place about thirty seconds ago. </p><p> </p><p>“And how do you know about this secret magic pool?”</p><p> </p><p>“I asked the bartender what they don’t put on the brochures. Come on. I’ll be your guide.” Rio grinned.</p><p> </p><p>As if summoned by the gods of trickery and mischief, Alice and Wanda’s shared giggles suddenly filled Agatha’s ears. She turned back toward the water and found them running back up to the loungers, mid-way through each sharing their own respective ‘legendary’ story from college.</p><p> </p><p>“No way, and you managed to get it all out of the carpet?”</p><p> </p><p>“It was a fucking miracle, Wanda, I’m telling you.” Alice huffed, plopping herself down naturally, and fishing that same fuckass-neon vape out of the pockets of her shorts, which had been slung over the back of the lounger.</p><p> </p><p>“Not that fuckin’ thing again.” Rio groaned, using her toes to flick a waft of sand up at her best friend.</p><p> </p><p>“Bitch! We are not having this argument again.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice feigned a scandalised tone, shielding herself from the sand assault with her unoccupied arm. Wanda just laughed at the two of them. Agatha was still trying to catch her breath, even now.</p><p> </p><p>“We were thinking of swimming out to the rock pools.” Rio said to the two of them, sitting up onto her elbows. “You guys interested?”</p><p> </p><p>“I would, but I’m beat.” Wanda frowned, patting Agatha’s hand. “Alice and I were actually thinking of grabbing brunch down at the beachside restaurant. Why don’t you guys do that while we eat? We could order you something for later?”</p><p> </p><p>“That sounds great.” Rio smiled, standing up and stretching.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.” Wanda acquiesced, turning to briefly, chastely, press a kiss to Agatha’s jaw. “We’ll see you guys later.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was waist-deep in the sea a mere three minutes after that, Rio swimming up ahead of her like a light guiding the way.</p><p> </p><p>The swim was longer than Agatha expected. They dove together beneath a rocky arch, the water going dark around them as sunlight filtered in thin, dancing lines. It was cool and silent, the kind of quiet that buzzed in your ears.</p><p> </p><p>They surfaced in a cove that felt like something out of a dream. Sunlight poured in through the natural gaps in the rock above, catching the shimmer of salt water and turning everything… well, shiny. The sound of waves echoed softly, like whispers in the vast space of a cathedral.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked the water from her eyes and took it in. </p><p> </p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was already climbing up onto a flat rock that jutted halfway out of the water. Her skin glistened, droplets racing down the curve of her back, and when she turned to face Agatha, sitting with one knee drawn up lazily, the light framed her like a painting.</p><p> </p><p>“I know.” Rio said. “It’s unreal, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha treaded water, not wanting to break the spell. “It’s beautiful.”</p><p> </p><p>“I figured you’d appreciate it. You have that… artist’s eye.”</p><p> </p><p>That pulled a smile from Agatha. “Lucky guess?”</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda mentioned it at dinner last night. Freelance artist, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, pulling herself up onto a smooth rock lower down. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Illustration, mostly. Some commissions, design work. It’s a hustle.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sounds like freedom.” Rio said, stretching her arms behind her. “I’m a lawyer.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm-hmm. Corporate. Contracts, negotiations, all that bullshit.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t seem the type.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not.” Rio replied, smiling. “But I’m good at it. And I get to be sharp. Ruthless, even.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, that actually does seem like you.” Agatha laughed. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile went lopsided at that. “Thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>She glanced down at the ripples, all the light catching in the water and dancing over their skin. The Grecian heat was different out here — softer, more intimate than a beach full of hotel guests. Everything felt suspended.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, if I didn’t know any better, I’d think you were scared of me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked up, startled. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Absurd. Absolutely not. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned forward, elbows on her knees, a slow smile curling at her lips. </p><p> </p><p>“You keep looking at me like I’m something… dangerous.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, flushing instantly. “I do not.”</p><p> </p><p>“You do.” Rio insisted, her voice like velvet now. “Like if you get too close, you’ll do something you can’t take back.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught again — <em> she was </em> <b> <em>so </em> </b> <em> tired of that happening. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Maybe I’m just admiring the view, you… statuesque fiend.” She shot back, forcing herself to hold Rio’s gaze.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t miss a beat, though she did smile at the quip.</p><p> </p><p>“You can touch me, you know. Statues were made for that, after all.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s body betrayed her before she could even think of a clever retort — her lips parted slightly, her core tightening with a sudden ache. </p><p> </p><p>She tried to laugh it off, to pretend she hadn’t just imagined her hands sliding over Rio’s thighs, over that long torso, peeling that suit off inch by inch.</p><p> </p><p>Rio must’ve seen the shift in her expression because her smile faltered, just a little, and her gaze dropped to Agatha’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled into the rock beside her, grounding herself. Her voice came out hoarse. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you always flirt like this?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, playfully again. </p><p> </p><p>“Only when it feels mutual.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence. Utter wordlessness. Only punctuated by the lap of Grecian water around them. The distant, low hum of chatter too far to distinguish.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. Fuck. Fucking fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>It stretched on for a really long time. Too long.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched the way sunlight glittered on the beads of water sliding down Rio’s collarbone, down the column of her throat. She watched the slow rise and fall of her chest, the steady, controlled way she breathed.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t know what clicked. Just that something in her tipped — like a thread finally snapped after being tugged on too tightly for too long.</p><p> </p><p>Without a word, Agatha slipped off her rock and into the water. The movement was soundless, deliberate, and she watched Rio’s eyes follow her — tracking every inch, every subtle shift of intention in her body.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swam forward until she reached the flat rock Rio sat on. Her hands came to rest on either side of Rio’s thighs.</p><p> </p><p>And then she did it.</p><p> </p><p>She let herself <em> touch.</em></p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Agatha slid a hand onto Rio’s bare thigh. Her skin was still warm from the sun, smooth from all the seawater. She felt Rio’s breath hitch, heard it catch just slightly in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Still, Rio didn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha took a breath and pushed further, let her palm roam up — just above the midline of her thigh. Incredibly indulgent now, like she had permission. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Because she did, didn’t she? </em>
</p><p> </p><p> Rio hadn't stopped her. In fact, she looked...</p><p> </p><p>God, she looked <em> wrecked </em>already, and Agatha had barely even done anything.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice, low and calm, finally broke the silence. </p><p> </p><p>“You like how that feels?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, almost startled by the words, her throat tight.</p><p> </p><p>“Y-Yeah.” She said, quietly. “I do.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, the corners of her mouth twitching. “Then come here.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t ask what here meant. </p><p> </p><p>She just let herself be guided. Rio reached a hand out and nudged gently at her waist, then her hips, guiding Agatha, silent again, into her lap. The water made everything glide easier. Slicker and weightless.</p><p> </p><p>And then, in a moment she would <em> never </em>have predicted to happen forty-eight hours ago, Agatha ended up straddling her. </p><p> </p><p>Those thighs pressed on either side of Rio’s, her core hovering just over one of Rio’s legs. She could feel the muscle underneath her, its warmth and solidity. She could also feel her heartbeat in her entire body; her chest, her neck, her wrists, her <em> cunt </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio's hands stayed loose, resting feather-light on Agatha’s waist. </p><p> </p><p>Not holding. Not directing. Just there.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re still in control.” She said softly, eyes locked with Agatha’s now. “But you can also just let go, sweetheart. Let yourself want it. Take it for yourself, Agatha, not for anybody else.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t really… do this. Not like this.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know.” Rio smiled, and there was something so tender in it. “I can tell. Doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to. Doesn’t mean you’re not <em> dying </em>to, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed down, just slightly, and her breath caught. </p><p> </p><p>The friction, the contact, even through the thin fabric of her suit, was enough to make her gasp. Her cunt was pressed right up against the expanse of Rio’s thigh. Her clit, aching now, pulsing, practically begging for something, <em> anything </em>, rubbed against the muscle and sent a shiver running through Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“There she is.” Rio murmured, almost to herself. </p><p> </p><p>Her hands remained where they were, gently cradling Agatha’s hips. She didn’t move, or rock her leg. She didn’t do anything but watch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha began to roll her hips, slow and cautious at first, eyes fluttering shut as heat licked through her. She ground her soaked cunt down against the muscle in Rio’s leg, trying not to let out a filthy, unbidden moan at the feeling. The sheer <em> ecstasy </em>in it.</p><p> </p><p>Her hands gripped Rio’s shoulders now for balance. Her movements were unsure, but she didn’t stop. Didn’t falter as she felt her hips begin to move on their own accord now. Humping her thigh, using it to get herself off.</p><p> </p><p><em> Fuck. Fuck, fuck, </em> <b> <em> fucking fuck. </em> </b></p><p> </p><p>Rio looked at her like she was a miracle.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s it, angel.” She cooed, voice like syrup with how sticky,<em> tooth-rotting sweet </em> it sounded. “You look so good like this.”</p><p> </p><p>Agath’s flush grew deeper, cheeks and chest tinged with pink.</p><p> </p><p>Her rhythm started to smooth out. She found the right angle, the right way to jut her hips, grind the length of her slit and the bundle of nerves at the top into Rio’s thigh.</p><p> </p><p>The ache she'd been swallowing for days, perhaps even <em> weeks </em>, started to burn hotter now – that drive to take something, to use it and use it and use it until she screamed. </p><p> </p><p>The sex she’d had earlier felt like nothing, in comparison. The feeling of being inside of Wanda, fingers curling, thumbs rubbing, tongue lashing – it seemed akin to a chore, now. Something Agatha had done out of obligation, of duty, of some kind of responsibility she was tied to.</p><p> </p><p>Arousal flooded through her with every pass of her hips against the meat of Rio’s thigh. Rio exhaled, slow and even. Agatha could see her pupils blown, the natural brown of her irises bled black.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so fucking <em> pretty </em>when you let go, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a soft, choked sound, trying to stifle it, but it slipped anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands lifted again, just slightly, brushing up to cradle Agatha’s jaw, her cheek. She didn’t kiss her. She didn’t lean in. Instead, she angled Agatha’s entire face up, holding it there so Rio could watch her come undone inch by inch.</p><p> </p><p>“Take what you want, baby.” Rio whispered. “You don’t have to give all the time.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hips stuttered, and she gasped again. Her fingers dug into Rio’s shoulders, blunt nails pressing down, grounding her. She could hear how the water splashed a little more violently now, lapping outward from where she was humping at Rio’s leg. </p><p> </p><p>She felt so full of want she thought she might fall apart from it.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re doing perfect.” Rio coached, seeming utterly enamoured. “Look at you. So <em> fucking gorgeous. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whined – <em> whined, for fuck’s sake </em> – and Rio’s thigh flexed just slightly beneath her, driving pressure exactly where she needed it. Her pussy clenched around nothing, walls closing in, searching for something to be filled by.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t do it anymore, and her desperation led her own hand down into her bottoms. Agatha let out a filthy cry when she slid two fingers inside of herself, filling her cunt up to the brim and twisting, curling, pumping. Her hips continued chasing that orgasm, the feeling of her fingers buried inside of herself and the delicious way she ground her clit against Rio’s skin nearly shoving her right over the edge.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, sweetheart,” Rio coaxed. “Let me see you fall apart. You deserve that.”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha? God, she <em> did </em>.</p><p> </p><p>She let it wash over her, drown her, and she let out a final, resounding, choked-off groan as her walls clamped down on her own fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Wave after wave of pleasure shot through her, the kind of climax that started in her spine and rolled through her entire body. Her front jerked forward as she came, face burying itself in Rio’s neck, her moaning turned strangled and soft.</p><p> </p><p>Through it all, Agatha’s hips didn’t (couldn’t) stop – grinding, jutting, thrusting forward, pushing her clit down into Rio’s thigh and rubbing as every single nerve lit ablaze. She was only able to stop herself when the pleasure mixed and churned into a sick, agonisingly <em> good </em>burn in her core.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand smoothed over her back now, holding Agatha steady, grounding her with murmured praise as she finally slowed her pace, slid her fingers from out of her pussy, and attempted to calm her body down.</p><p> </p><p>“Beautiful. That’s it. That’s my pretty girl.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t speak. Couldn’t. She’d fuck it up if she spoke now, she was certain of it.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> What. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Instead, Agatha just sat there, chest heaving, feeling like something inside her stomach had cracked wide open like a cluster of crystals.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t ask for anything in return. </p><p> </p><p>She just let Agatha rest there, trembling, in her lap.</p>

<p>
<span>“You haven’t worn this in </span>
<em>
<span>forever</span>
</em>
<span>, it looks so good on you, baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That’s what Wanda had said, holding it up with a smile, and </span>
<em>
<span>that’s </span>
</em>
<span>how Agatha found herself standing in front of the room’s full-length mirror, adjusting the waist of her skirt with slightly trembling fingers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was short. Too short, maybe. Definitely not the sort of thing she usually wore to dinner, but Wanda had pulled it out of the suitcase so excitedly that she hadn’t been able to say no.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So she had put it on, and she tried to ignore the way it clung to her thighs. Her legs still felt wobbly, like the ghost of Rio’s thigh was imprinted on her skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t feel guilty.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She should. She’d thought that’d be the worst part, the </span>
<em>
<span>drowning </span>
</em>
<span>in guilt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But instead, she felt something closer to… floating, maybe? A strange kind of weightlessness, like she’d finally stopped treading water in a panic and simply let go. Rio’s words had sunk in deep, and no matter how many times Agatha blinked or shook her head or focused on Wanda getting ready on the other side of the room, she couldn’t stop hearing them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>You’re so fucking pretty when you let go, Agatha.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She exhaled and reached for her shirt. Loose-fit, sleeveless, tucked into the waistband. She still looked like herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sort of. If not for the way her face kept going distant in the mirror.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda twirled in front of her, giddy in her red halter dress with a slit down the side of her leg. She leaned into the mirror beside Agatha and fixed a red curl, humming.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re quiet.” She said, glancing at Agatha’s reflection. “Everything okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah.” Agatha said too quickly. “Just tired. Sun, you know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda grinned and kissed her on the cheek, leaving a faint gloss-print. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re gonna perk up once we get some wine in you. Alice texted me. They’re already at the restaurant.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Already? You two, what? You planned this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, while you were in the shower. She was asking what we were doing tonight, and I said let’s just do the same thing as yesterday. They liked it. I liked it.” Wanda nodded, slipping her sandals on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth but said nothing. A mix of dread and anticipation twisted in her gut, </span>
<em>
<span>obviously </span>
</em>
<span>due to the notion that she would now have to endure another dinner with–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Alright. Okay. It’s going to be </span>
</em>
<b>
<em>fine.</em>
</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pulled on her earrings, trying to breathe normally. Wanda came up behind her again, smoothing her hands over Agatha’s bare shoulders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You look so hot in this.” She said, voice low, admiring.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled faintly. “Thanks.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her hands dipped down, cupping Agatha’s tits in her palms, squeezing as she leaned in to nose at her neck and inhale.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You wanna..?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt sick.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Ah, there’s the guilt.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She forced a chuckle and placed her hands over Wanda’s, tugging them away and instead lacing their fingers together as she turned around.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We should probably head out now, since they’re waiting for us and all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda nodded, genuinely agreeing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re right. Okay, c’mon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They left the room and headed right down to the restaurant, which they found to be even busier tonight. The air was filled with chatter and the occasional clink of cutlery and porcelain and glass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha spotted them first – Rio sitting in crisp, black loose slacks and a low-buttoned olive shirt, sleeves rolled up, collar open and exposing the jut of her collarbones. Alice was beside her in dark jeans and a darker tee with a sweetheart neckline, hair pinned back in a messy knot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hated the flutter in her stomach, watching as Rio’s dark hair caught in the breeze, like something right out of a noughties romcom.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her breath caught. She could still feel it — Rio’s hand on her waist, the press of her thigh in between her legs, the way she’d whispered </span>
<em>
<span>sweetheart</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda greeted them first, beaming as she slipped into her seat beside Alice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hi, gorgeous girls.” Wanda said, and Alice lifted her glass in acknowledgement and smiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes landed on Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey.” She said quietly. Just to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat beside her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So.” Alice was saying, “I’m dying to know; do you two want to do the boat trip thing tomorrow?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, that looked fun!” Wanda beamed. “I told Agatha we should, didn’t I, baby?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hm? Yeah. Sure. Sounds good.” Agatha replied, half-heartedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Wanda launched into a story, probably about the guy on their flight whose sex toys had fallen right out of his luggage, Rio leaned in again; subtle, slow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So the boat trip. It’s a long one. Leaves just after breakfast and runs till sundown. But they stop halfway, on this tiny little island. Practically empty. There’s a cove, tucked behind some cliffs — gorgeous water, barely anyone around.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her tone didn’t change, but her mouth curved ever so slightly. Her hand brushed against Agatha’s bare thigh under the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>
<em>Whatthefuckwhatthefuckwhatthefuck</em>
</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Very… private.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, setting her glass down just a little too fast.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda laughed at her own punchline and turned to Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That sounds amazing. Like a movie or something. Do people swim there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mmhm. Swim, sunbathe… whatever.” Her eyes lingered on Agatha’s mouth, before she turned to Wanda with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice nodded enthusiastically. “Ugh, I want to tan topless on a rock like I’m in a goddamn perfume commercial. You’re selling me on this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re doing it. Agatha, you’re in, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to speak but only nodded. She didn’t trust her voice — not with Rio’s hand now on her thigh, a little higher this time, fingertips slow and teasing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Control. Yourself. Fucking hell.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good.” Rio murmured beside her. “It’ll be worth it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her hand slid up between Agatha’s thighs, bold and purposeful now. The pressure of her fingers parted Agatha’s legs just slightly under the tablecloth. She leaned in, not looking at her directly, just speaking like it was any other hushed side comment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You need it again?” Her voice was low, calm. “You liked it this morning, didn’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t answer, couldn’t, but her legs didn’t close. Rio’s hand slid right up to the front of her panties, finding them soaked. She pressed her fingertips against the slight bump of her clit, revelling in the way Agatha’s knee jerked at the contact.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tell me.” Rio whispered. “Or stop me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt heat crawl from her neck to her chest to her face. Her hands clenched the napkin in her lap. Her mouth opened but she had no words.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers pressed more firmly, the heel of her palm grinding up through the fabric now. Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut for half a second — just enough for her to hate herself for how good it felt; a woman she’d met two days ago, with her hand up Agatha’s skirt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You like this.” Rio whispered. “Don’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her eyes, heart pounding, lips parted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was about to say something, </span>
<b>anything</b>
<span>, when the waiter appeared at her shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your starters.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand slipped away instantly, disappearing as if it had never been there. She leaned back, smiling at the plates as if her own hands hadn’t just been between Agatha’s thighs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stayed perfectly still as the food was placed in front of her; some soft white cheese drizzled with honey and herbs, golden bread glistening beside it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She couldn't even look at it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>All she could feel was the phantom pressure still throbbing in her core. Rio had pressed down </span>
<em>
<span>hard,</span>
</em>
<span> right before pulling away. Hard enough that Agatha nearly gasped aloud.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The conversation resumed, but she couldn’t join it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda was chattering to Alice about Greek wines, asking questions, waving her fork around. Agatha barely heard a word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio cut a piece of her lamb, elegant somehow, because </span>
<em>
<span>of course she did</span>
</em>
<span>, and offered a casual, quiet question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha forced a nod. “Fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re not eating.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not hungry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her a second longer, then returned to her food with a little smile — like she knew. Like she could still feel the tension lingering between her fingers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed her thighs together, desperate for relief but terrified of what it would mean to want it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With Wanda right there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With people sitting all around them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She glanced at Wanda, who was giggling at something Alice had just said. Her cheeks were flushed from the wine, her dress strap slipping off one shoulder, her smile bright.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha felt like she was coming undone in silence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nudged her knee under the table. Agatha looked at her, and there was nothing innocent in that look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Dinner felt like hours of slow, unbridled torture – Agatha couldn’t’ve been quicker to stand up from her seat when all cutlery had been set down and napkins sat crumpled on their empty plates.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They all stepped out of the restaurant, when Wanda suddenly gasped and tugged at Alice’s arm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my god,” Wanda whispered excitedly, nodding toward the lobby bar. “Is that a 90s night?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice’s eyes lit up. “Yes! I saw a flyer about it! Karaoke, themed drinks, </span>
<em>
<span>Spice Girls </span>
</em>
<span>on loop. Oh we have to go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda turned to Agatha, practically bouncing. “Please come? I want to do shots and sing </span>
<em>
<span>TLC </span>
</em>
<span>in front of strangers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re wiped.” Rio interrupted smoothly, stepping in before Agatha had to scramble. “Long day in the sun. We’re probably just gonna go up and head to bed early, if that’s alright with you guys.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda gave Rio a grin, all appreciation and affection. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re so sweet, Rio.” She reached over to hold Agatha’s shoulder as she planted a kiss on her lips. “Bye, honey.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“See you guys!” Alice added, already nodding her head to </span>
<em>
<span>No Scrubs.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The two girls disappeared into the music and lights, arms linked, already talking about what song they’d duet to first.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The second they were gone, Rio turned to Agatha, her voice lowering into something entirely different.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Back to the room?” Agatha’s voice was quiet, and a little disappointed, honestly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No.” Rio said, already walking away with Agatha in tow. “Somewhere better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They took the stairs instead of the elevator, winding up narrow side staircases until they reached one of the hotel’s highest floors. The lights here were dimmer, most of the guests tucked away in their rooms. Rio turned left, away from the suites, and stopped in front of a set of tall, curved glass doors with gold handles.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The cocktail bar.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Closed</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know this door is locked, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio just grinned, reached into the plant beside the door, and pulled out a little silver key. “Not anymore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re kidding.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nope. Found it earlier while snooping around.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Snooping around?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned like that was a normal thing to do, and Agatha was slowly coming to realise she was… odd, in a stupidly charming way. To say the least.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She unlocked the doors and held one open for Agatha. “After you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha walked toward the bar almost instantly, glancing back as Rio followed, locking the door behind them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This feels illegal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not illegal. Just... creatively unsupervised?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, and her cheeks flushed pink as she unintentionally snorted. Rio looked as though she found it endearing, but she didn’t comment on it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sidled up behind the bar and pulled out two highball glasses, placed them in front of them both, then scanned the selection. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright. Pick your poison.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Whatever you’re having.” Agatha shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bold choice.” Rio smirked and reached for the bourbon. “You sure you trust me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No.” Agatha said, smiling despite herself. “Not at all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio poured two fingers each, added ice, a twist of orange from the fridge beneath the counter, and slid a glass over. Agatha picked hers up, swirled it once, and took a sip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They stood there in silence for a beat. Rio broke the quiet first.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So. Earlier.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That was… good for you, wasn’t it?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, then nodded, slowly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah. I liked it. Um, a lot more than I thought I would.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You liked letting go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted softly. “I didn’t let go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not control-wise. I mean, you let yourself </span>
<em>
<span>take, </span>
</em>
<span>and you still had the control</span>
<em>
<span>. </span>
</em>
<span>Like we talked about.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her glass between her palms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t... I’m not good at being on the receiving end. I’ve always been the one to lead. With Wanda. With anyone, really. That’s how I learned to maintain my power over them. And every time they gave back, or they offered to… I didn’t think I could. I didn’t want to lose control.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s not a bad thing.” Rio said gently. Then, she continued.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Being in control can be hot, I get it. But you don’t have to </span>
<em>
<span>give it up</span>
</em>
<span> to receive, Agatha. You can still be the one in charge, even when you’re the one coming apart.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down into her glass. “I think... I think I’d like to be on the receiving end a little more. Maybe just, I don’t know, be a little clearer in what I want.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You think Wanda’s up for that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At that, Agatha couldn’t hide the way her face scrunched up, as if to say </span>
<em>
<span>no, probably not.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice softened after that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then you should let someone help you with that.”</span>

<em>
<span>Rio’s voice softened after that. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Then you should let someone help you with that.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up again. Rio’s eyes were trained solely on her. Her jaw, that little pinch in her brow, the quiet patience in her expression; she looked composed, somehow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha, on the other hand, felt like she might combust. Literally, and sexually too. Sue her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Someone like you?” She asked quietly, her tone intentionally teasing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah. Someone </span>
<em>
<span>like me</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio took another sip of her drink, placed it back down, and leaned her elbows on the bar.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I like giving.” She smiled, laughing at her own statement. “I’m sure you know that already. I like knowing what makes a woman feel good. I like the little noises, the trembling, the way her legs shake when I get her just right. And I </span>
<em>
<span>love </span>
</em>
<span>being told what to do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted where she stood, heat crawling beneath her skin again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her panties were ruined for a third time in nearly two days.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck’s sake.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice dropped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But if you told me to hold you down and make you come until you couldn’t speak anymore, I’d do that too. Happily.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s grip on her glass tightened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This is insane.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mm.” Rio said, tilting her head. “You still want to go back to your room?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Jesus Christ, no.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wasn’t sure who moved first.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Maybe it was her hand, maybe it was the way Rio looked at her like she already knew every answer Agatha didn’t want to ask out loud. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But something shifted. The air became heavier, and they got closer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She reached across the slim bar top, slowly, and took Rio’s hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was warm and firm, her fingers longer than Agatha remembered (how she somehow forgot, Agatha’ll never know), her palm calloused from some trait Rio hadn’t yet explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What am I supposed to do with you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t hesitate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tell me where to put it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hesitated, then guided Rio’s hand down until it rested against her waist, her shirt riding up just slightly to allow skin-to-skin contact.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There.” She said quietly. “Start there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s palm flattened against her hip, </span>
<em>
<span>obedient</span>
</em>
<span>, fingers curving gently around her skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, ma’am.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nearly groaned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They were stood close enough together that she finally came to realise just how </span>
<em>
<span>tall </span>
</em>
<span>Rio was. Agatha’s chin was forced to tilt up slightly to look her in the eye, and she didn’t necessarily lean in – but their faces hovered in the same breath of air, noses brushing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sucked in a breath, arousal stirring in her stomach yet again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She brought her own hand down, letting her fingers trail over the expensive-feeling material of Rio’s button-down. She paused just above the hem and curled, snaking her thumb between the open space of the lowest button.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then, she lifted. Pulled the hem of Rio’s shirt up enough to get her hand underneath it now, brushing over the firm lines of Rio’s stomach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck.” Agatha let out involuntarily, gaze finally dipping down to watch her own hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She dragged her nails up along in a scratching motion, leaving behind red, stark streaks behind. Rio didn’t even flinch, not once; she just exhaled, shuddering ever-so slightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha indulged. She let her fingers dip lower, sneaking past the waistband easily and–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her breath hitched in the back of her throat for the second time in the span of five minutes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The tips of her fingers brushed over something incredibly familiar. Smooth, unmistakable leather, wrapped snug over her hips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A harness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped before she could stop herself, sharp and quiet, her fingers still resting on the strap like it had shocked her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was perfectly still, watching her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t say anything as she mulled it over, watched for Rio’s reaction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Finally, she dipped lower. Searching, until she reached past the cool buckles, finding and wrapping her hand around the warmth of the silicone sitting beneath Rio’s boxers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her mouth tipped open in focus, continuing to track Rio’s reaction in her facial expression, her gaze, her lips – she grabbed a little firmer this time, wrapping her hand around it, and stroked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice was almost imperceptibly quiet, but no less dripping in desire.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She used the hand anchored around her waist to tug her in slightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>want?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had an idea. An invasive, unexpected, insane idea, at least to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Running her tongue along her bottom lip, wetting it, she blinked owlishly at Rio and stroked a second time, pumping her hand a little faster, more urgent.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Push me up against the bar.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes darkened instantly. The words hit her like a jolt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before she could second-guess it, Rio obeyed, firm hands shifting her body until Agatha’s back met the polished wood of the bar. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t untoward. It wasn’t rushed. It was precise — controlled, rough enough to entice Agatha, just like before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The height difference worked in Rio’s favor; her hips pinned Agatha with ease, her thigh pressing between Agatha’s legs as she leaned in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Touch my pussy.” She ordered, her voice cracked and commanding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand went up her thigh, dragging the hem of her skirt with it instantaneously. She moved it up to the front of Agatha’s panties again, like she’d done back at the table, and </span>
<em>
<span>pressed</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re so wet.” Rio groaned, the words hitting Agatha’s lips in a fanning of breath. She smelled of bourbon and orange, a delicious mixture.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Take them off.” Agatha instructed, chest heaving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t hesitate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She trailed her hand back upward to the waistband of her panties, using two fingers to pull them down Agatha’s legs. She briefly noted the pretty, dark purple lace and adorning bow at the centre of the waistband, and just how good it looked on her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Still. They'd look much better off.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio followed the motion of her hands. Slowly kneeling as she stripped Agatha of her underwear, tugging and tugging, getting lower and lower, until they were off for certain, and Rio was on her knees in front of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sounded </span>
<em>
<span>pained </span>
</em>
<span>as she stared at the uncovered glory in front of her. Agatha’s pussy was drenched; her labia was puffy, glistening, expectant for something. The patch of hair atop her pubic bone was trimmed, but barely. Just enough to be regarded as tamed</span>
<em>
<span>.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>How untoward of her.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio spared a glance up at Agatha, pupils blown again. Her hands looked like they were itching to do something, touch someone, feel anything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha. What do you want me to do? You have to tell me, baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Put my leg up onto your shoulder.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She gently coaxed a hand around the flesh of her thigh, lifting it up, draping it along the curve of her own shoulder and situating it there with a steadied hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After that, Rio didn’t move again. Stared up at Agatha, expectant, awaiting her next command.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eat me out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, like she’d just won the fucking lottery.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Yes, ma’am</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, ran her tongue up along the length of her slit – and Agatha simply lost it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was forced to slap her own hand over her mouth, poorly disguising the moan torn out of her throat at the first contact of Rio’s tongue against her. And it only got worse, more pleasurable, more </span>
<em>
<span>absurdly </span>
</em>
<span>delicious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand tightened around the thigh slung upon her shoulder, the short curves of her nails digging into the skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her inhibitions were all loose now – her brain felt hazy, the mix of the alcohol she’d consumed melding with the ungodly taste of Agatha’s pussy, the slick, hot wetness, the feeling of her thigh tensing against her cheek, the moans she heard from above.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha flailed for an excuse. For a way to rationalise this; some stranger, some </span>
<em>
<span>gorgeous stranger, </span>
</em>
<span>who wasn’t her fiancée was currently on her knees devouring her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>No. Worshipping. It’s fucking worship.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She flattened her tongue against Agatha’s clit and laved over it, circling just a little, before taking it into her mouth and sucking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s body jackknifed at that, her stomach caving in with the force of her shock. Her hand shot down to Rio’s head, fingers snaking their way into her hair and tugging at the strands. She whined filthily as Rio flicked the tip of her tongue out intermittently, stimulating her clit and groaning into her cunt, the vibrations of that only adding to the sheer pleasure of it all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then, Agatha tugged Rio back by the hair. Hard enough to get her to stop.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked back up at her now, mouth wide open, lips and chin glistening with a mixture of her own saliva and Agatha’s juices.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha released Rio’s hair, instead grabbing the edge of the bar behind her for balance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Take it out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio obeyed. Quick, smooth motion. She stood up and reinstated her place in between Agatha’s legs, pressing into her ever-so slightly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha could hear the faint jingle of leather and buckles, the sound of clothes shifting against each other.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio pushed down the waistband of her slacks, dragging her boxers down with it and exposing the leather of her harness and the cock she had fitted within the O-ring.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was </span>
<em>
<span>fucking </span>
</em>
<span>beautiful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Deep, dark green, probably seven or eight inches long. She wrapped her hand around it, teeth sunken into her bottom lip, and guided Agatha to look up into her eyes, coaxing her chin up with her thumb.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Get it wet for me, will you, baby?” She asked, tilting her head contemplatively.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nearly melted into the floor right then and there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She leaned forward into Rio’s open palm, gathered a bunch of saliva in her mouth, before spitting into it. All the while, their eye contact never broke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned and nodded to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re perfect.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then, she reached down and began coating the strap in Agatha’s spit, running her hand along the shaft until it gleamed. Agatha’s breath hitched for the hundredth time that night as Rio’s entire body tilted forward with the movement, her nose brushing Agatha’s again with how close they were.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And, for some godforsaken reason, Agatha suddenly blurted out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t kiss me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s face remained only inches from hers, their noses brushing again, foreheads almost touching.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay.” She nodded, a barely-there shake of her head. “Whatever you want, angel.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s unoccupied hand slid behind Agatha’s thigh, moving it up around her waist this time, whilst the other took a firmer grip on the base of her shaft and guided it to the soaked, aching entrance of Agatha’s cunt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You sure about this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t need a second to think. To consider it. To consider the inevitable consequences of her actions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead, she nodded, a second barely-there shake of her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha gasped again, louder this time, when Rio pushed her cock into her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was nothing careful about it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched around the intrusion, her head falling back slightly, but Rio stayed so, so close. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>One hand gripped the back of Agatha’s thigh, holding her pussy open, and the other gripped her waist, steadying her, grounding her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re so hot, Agatha.” Rio whispered. “So pretty like this, stretched around my cock.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha whimpered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tell me how you want it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Harder.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Done.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio obeyed. She slipped out of her, the drag of the silicone through her pussy making a loud, obscene </span>
<em>
<span>squelch </span>
</em>
<span>as it went, before thrusting back in with more force this time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha cried out as Rio’s cock breeched her stomach, the stretch delicious and beautifully painful, and making her feel so fucking </span>
<em>
<span>full.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Meanwhile, Rio herself watched in awe as she entered Agatha. Eyes trained on that spot above her pubic bone, the bump in her stomach from where the tip of her cock was pressing into it – Rio wanted to photograph it, frame it, and make sure it was the centrepiece of her goddamn living room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re taking me so well.” She let out dazedly, almost slurring her words.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha writhed against the bar, her skirt bunched at her waist, shirt half-open now. Rio tore her bra off like it was paper, getting her hands on Agatha’s tits and sucking at a nipple, flicking over it like she’d done with her clit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio thrust into her like she belonged there. To the both of them, she </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span>, really.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And God, the sounds they were making — slick and soft and needy, the quiet whimpering that kept slipping out of Agatha’s mouth despite how hard she tried to stay composed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She gripped Rio’s shirt in her fists, pulling her impossibly closer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Faster, Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A noise of acknowledgement. Rio slid a hand around to the small of Agatha’s back, bracing her other on the countertop, and began pumping into her even faster. Slamming into her, fucking her like it was the latest trend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re so </span>
<em>
<span>fucking </span>
</em>
<span>good at this.” Agatha gasped out, barely coherent.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You deserve it.” Rio rasped. “You deserve everything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Every thrust was angled just right — deep, fast, relentless. Agatha felt like she was being split in two. Felt like she was right where she was meant to be. Astride a bartop counter, legs wrapped around Rio’s waist, her cunt filled to the brim.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Rio’s face never left hers. Their mouths hovered apart, like a kiss was waiting to happen, but Rio was a gentleman, of course, and kept her distance like Agatha had asked her to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha? Agatha couldn’t think. Couldn’t breathe.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Say it again.” She commanded, rather than asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio raised a brow, questioning. Agatha just whimpered, her walls clenching around her cock instinctively, silently communicating what she needed. Rio understood.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re so good.” She whispered. “So goddamn pretty. My sweet girl.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s whole body shuddered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At some point, Rio had reached between them and had begun rubbing at her clit with her two middle fingers. It was so firm, so rhythmic – utter perfection. Agatha moaned as her walls clenched around Rio’s cock again, and all attempts to stay even the tiniest bit quiet had been flung full-speed out of the window.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gonna… come…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’d managed to get it out through choked whimpers, through gasps and intakes of air, and Rio just nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The knot in her gut snapped — violently, enough so that Agatha was embarrassed to recall later on the </span>
<em>
<span>scream </span>
</em>
<span>she’d let out as she orgasmed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her pussy clamped down on Rio a final time, only this time Rio relented and slowed her thrusts to a stop. Her cock remained inside of Agatha for a while, simply sitting there, filling her up, all while she’d kept up the pace of her fingers against Agatha’s oversensitive clit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She fell forward, buried her face in the crook of Rio’s neck, bit down on her own moan as her body buckled, trembling in her arms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Too m-much, </span>
<em>
<span>stop</span>
</em>
<span>.” Agatha whined, desperately slapping her hand down towards Rio’s wrist until the contact ceased.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> Rio held her through it, firm and steady, murmuring soft praises into her hair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just like that, angel. That’s it. You’re so good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breathing slowed in time with Rio’s heartbeat. She gulped and had to grab ahold of Rio’s shoulders to steady her trembling stature.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stayed there awhile, forehead pressed to Rio’s temple, and tried her hardest not to think too much about the fiancée who’d brought her on this trip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio held her body like she’d been granted a privilege, like she’d needed it her whole life.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha wasn’t about to let that go just yet.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha woke with a start that morning, and her thighs ached in that particular way that immediately reminded her <b>why</b>.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Say it again.” She commanded, rather than asked. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio raised a brow, questioning. Agatha just whimpered, her walls clenching around her cock instinctively, silently communicating what she needed. Rio understood. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You’re so good.” She whispered. “So goddamn pretty. My sweet girl.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked groggily, trying to ignore the sudden flashes of memory, and realised the spot in bed beside her was empty.</p><p> </p><p>"Good morning, sleepyhead!"</p><p> </p><p>Not for long, apparently.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s voice floated through the open bathroom door. A second later, she walked into the room barefoot and smiling, brushing out her long hair in front of the mirror in just a towel. Her skin had picked up a golden hue from all the sun. </p><p> </p><p>She looked happy.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Completely unaware, more like. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“What time is it?” Agatha said as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>"Late enough that I’m officially allowed to harass you into getting up." Wanda said brightly, tossing her brush onto the bed. “We’re going on a boat trip today, baby!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned and rolled over, burying her face in the pillow. </p><p> </p><p>"Five more minutes."</p><p> </p><p>But she heard Wanda's delighted giggle before the mattress dipped. And then, without warning, Wanda climbed right into her lap, straddling her waist from behind. She leaned down and kissed Agatha’s baby hairs at the back of her neck, then round to her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>“Wake up. C’mon, gorgeous. The sea awaits.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh, eyes still closed, letting the moment happen. Maybe letting it happen could erase the major, <em> major </em>fuck-up Agatha committed last night.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. Fuckity fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Instead of vomiting from unease, Agatha managed to get out; “You’re way too energetic for this hour.”</p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me.” Wanda grinned. “But I’m thrilled to go sailing on Greek waters with my beautiful fiancée, thank you very much. Now <b>get up</b>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha peeked one eye open at her. </p><p> </p><p>“Fine.”</p><p> </p><p>In reply, Wanda grinned and reached down to kiss her for a final time on the lips. She then slid off of Agatha’s back, giving the woman below her a strange sort of whiplash. </p><p> </p><p>“Here's the plan: we’re meeting at the docks in an hour. The boat takes us out around the coast, then we’ll stop at a little island nearby — Rio says there’s a cove, so we’ll swim there, get lunch at this beach café she found, then chill in the sun for as long as we want.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stilled a beat at the mention of Rio’s name. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Memories she’s been doing such a good job of ignoring (incorrect, but whatever) flooded in like a torrential landslide.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s coming?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yep. So’s Alice. Oh!” Wanda grabbed her phone from the vanity, waving it like a prize. “I got their numbers last night. I figured it’d be easier to keep everyone coordinated.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat went dry. “Cool.”</p><p> </p><p>She watched Wanda scroll through her screen, humming some song from last night’s 90s bash under her breath, completely unaware.</p><p> </p><p>After she disappeared back into the bathroom, Agatha pulled her own phone into her lap and opened her contacts.</p><p> </p><p>Alice came first. She typed in her phone number and left it at that, the only additional information added being a (<em> White Lotus </em>) beside her name.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She hesitated before tapping <em> Add Contact </em>.</p><p> </p><p><em> Rio (White Lotus) </em> she typed, then quickly deleted the parentheses and just left it: <em> Rio. </em></p><p> </p><p>Her fingers hovered. Then, checking again to be sure Wanda was still occupied, she opened a message window.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : So you're a morning person, huh?  </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> You’re not going to make me do yoga on the boat, are you? </em></p><p> </p><p>The response came a minute later.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : i’d never force that kind of cruelty on you. you can suffer with the hangover in peace. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled at her screen.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : How considerate. Maybe you do have a soft side. </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : baby i can be hard for you if need be </em></p><p> </p><p>Her chest squeezed.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : Dangerous thing to say. </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : truth usually is tbh </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit her lip, the smile now undeniable, even as nerves fluttered in her belly. She typed slower this time.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : You wore me out last night, y’know. </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : oh, i know. im still replaying it. </em></p><p> </p><p>A beat passed.</p><p> </p><p>Then another message:</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : i loved the way you sounded, agatha. i keep thinking about it. </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> in fact, ive fucked myself twice in the space of an hour just thinking about how good you felt under me, baby </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s whole body tensed with heat. Her fingers hovered again, before she could stop herself.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : Stop.  </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> You’re gonna make me climb back into bed and pretend it’s your hand waking me up instead. </em></p><p> </p><p>There was a pause.</p><p> </p><p>Then:</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : fuck, don’t say shit like that. </em></p><p> </p><p>Another beat.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : would you? </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the screen a moment longer, her breath shallow.</p><p> </p><p>From the bathroom, Wanda called out.</p><p> </p><p>“You almost ready, babe?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flinched slightly, startled back into the room. She cleared her throat and quickly hid her phone in the nightstand, regrettably missing the next message from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, getting dressed now!”</p><p> </p><p>She quickly locked her phone, chest pounding, and got to her feet.</p><p> </p><p>She dressed in her new swimsuit; a sleek black one-piece with cutouts at the waist and a plunging neckline, and pulled a sheer white linen shirt over her torso. She paired it with loose denim shorts and square-framed sunglasses. She looked effortless, as put-together as she could muster.</p><p> </p><p>But inside, Agatha was anything but.</p><p> </p><p>She reached into the nightstand, grabbed her phone, and turned on the Do Not Disturb feature, ignoring the urge to open the waiting notification. Then she followed Wanda out the door.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚢</p><p> </p><p>The sun was sharp and bright above the marina, already baking the concrete and steel that surrounded the docked boat. Its white surface gleamed like something out of a glossy travel magazine, casting a blinding reflection that made Agatha squint even behind her sunglasses. </p><p> </p><p>She clutched a half-finished iced coffee and let Wanda lead her by the hand up the gangplank, half-heartedly laughing at some joke about "<em> adventure time </em>" under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>They climbed onto the lower deck of the gorgeous yacht-like ship, and slipped into two seats near the back, shielded slightly from the breeze. Wanda curled against her, impossibly chipper, while Agatha focused on the slow rock of the boat and the sound of rope slapping against metal. Anything to take her mind off the plaguing thoughts of last night up in the bar.</p><p> </p><p>A few minutes later, a burst of laughter rang out — familiar, effortless. Agatha looked up and there they were.</p><p> </p><p>Alice led the trio, hair swept up in a messy bun and oversized sunglasses that nearly swallowed her face. Next to her was Rio, and God. The sight of <em> her </em>made something clench low in Agatha’s stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s swimsuit was nothing short of obscene in its simplicity — a sharp black one-piece that hugged every line of her body. High-cut at the hips and low in the back, it framed her like a Greek statue remade in glossy noir. She wore sheer wide-leg linen pants unbuttoned and billowing, the suggestion of the suit beneath them just barely visible. Her sunglasses were oversized, and, honestly, she looked like she owned the boat. Maybe the ocean too.</p><p> </p><p>And then came Jen.</p><p> </p><p>Jen was an immediate vision — dark skin glowing under the sun, wearing a burnt-orange bikini top with gold rings at the straps, paired with a semi-sheer matching sarong tied at the hip. Her braids were swept to one side, lashes thick and curled up like they'd been freshly done. She carried a peach ice vape in one hand, a thin gold chain resting just above her collarbone. The scent of something sugary and floral wafted by as she passed.</p><p> </p><p>They took seats near them, the five of them forming a loose, perfect semicircle. Someone popped a bottle of champagne from somewhere up top, and a crew member appeared with flutes of the bubbling gold liquid. Everyone took one. Rio sat beside Agatha, their knees nearly touching.</p><p> </p><p>“You all look ready for a magazine spread.” Wanda said brightly, clearly in hostess mode. She gestured between them. “Agatha, you haven’t met Jen yet, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I don’t think so.” Agatha said, turning toward her with a polite smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi.” Jen grinned, her voice syrupy smooth. “Met these two at 90s night. I was very drunk, so hopefully I wasn’t annoying.”</p><p> </p><p>“You were charming.” Alice blurted, way too fast. Her cheeks turned pink the second it was out.</p><p> </p><p>Jen beamed, clearly not missing the note of affection. “I’ll take charming.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think I called you a ‘<em> god-tier hottie </em>’ at one point.” Wanda admitted, laughing. “Alice definitely agreed.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sipped her champagne to mask her smile. Across from her, Rio tipped her glass back, hiding her own expression.</p><p> </p><p>“I was just telling Alice about my ex.” Jen added, curling her vape between her fingers. “Total nightmare. Stunning though. Of course, but she <em> really </em>didn’t know how to handle me.”</p><p> </p><p>“She was a girl?” Wanda asked, eager and almost excited sounding.</p><p> </p><p>Jen raised an eyebrow. “Yeah. I’m bi. You good with that?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, yeah. Yes!” Wanda grinned. “I’m bi too. Very.”</p><p> </p><p>The two of them spiraled into a side conversation about terrible exes and first kisses, laughing and comparing stories. Rio watched, delighted, and was already planning how to play matchmaker when Alice joined the conversation and managed to stop herself freezing up as Jen’s hand squeezed ahold of her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Then, perhaps predictably, Wanda leaned in, wrapped an arm around Agatha’s shoulders, and pressed a kiss to her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so lucky.” Jen noted, nudging Wanda’s arm. “You’ve got a gorgeous smile, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flushed and tried to laugh it off. Wanda squeezed her side.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m the lucky one.” Agatha said, half-believing the statement in actuality. It sounded right in her head, and seemed to do the job.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re engaged, actually.” Wanda absolutely <em> beamed </em>, showed off her hand and the ring that sparkled in the sun.</p><p> </p><p>Jen offered polite congratulations. Alice’s smile couldn’t’ve been bigger as Jen launched into another rattle about how she’s ‘looking for a wife, too.’</p><p> </p><p>The boat began to shift; ropes cast off, the hum of the engine rising.</p><p> </p><p>“I think I’m gonna sit up here with you.” Wanda said to Jen. “You mentioned your skincare line, right? I wanna stalk your Instagram.”</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s go, I’ll show you the feed.” Jen said, pulling her phone out.</p><p> </p><p>They moved to a bench closer to the front, leaving Agatha and Rio alone — or as alone as they could be surrounded by gentle waves and soft conversations.</p><p> </p><p>Then? </p><p> </p><p><b>Buzz</b>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Her phone lit up. A message from Rio.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : i was going to offer you my lap to sit on when we first got here, but i figured it’d be distracting </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced up. Rio wasn’t looking at her. Just calmly reclined, eyes on the sea, sunglasses shielding everything. She typed:</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : You assume I wouldn’t take it? </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> not sure that’d go over well with the fiancé </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> Indulge me. You think I would, or not? </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : oh in a perfect world i’d assume you’d take it. that’s the problem. </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : you’d grind on it and forget how to behave </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s pulse spiked. She shifted in her seat.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : And if I want to misbehave? </em></p><p> </p><p>A pause.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : tell me what you’re wearing under those shorts </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat dried. She glanced at the others, all preoccupied. Wanda laughing, Alice leaning too close to Jen.</p><p> </p><p>She responded.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : Black one-piece. Cutouts at my waist. Plunging neckline. </em></p><p> </p><p>She watched Rio’s throat bob as she swallowed. The corners of her mouth lifted.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : fuck </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : You wouldn’t believe how good my tits look in this swimsuit, baby. </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : fuuuck agatha </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : let me kneel under the table and go down on you pls pls pls </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath and crossed her legs tightly. Her whole body was buzzing. Her thighs ached. She’d come twice just last night and she was still ready to crawl into Rio’s lap and ride her until the boat rocked harder than the tide.</p><p> </p><p>She typed, slowly.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : Later. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio locked eyes with her, sunglasses slipping down her nose just enough that Agatha could see the heat there.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : you looked so pretty falling apart last night. im literally gonna have dreams about it  </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio</em> </b> <em> : you gonna let me taste it again when you cum next time? </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha shut off her phone before she could combust.</p><p> </p><p>And still, somehow, all she could do was smile, ignoring the grin on Rio’s own face and keeping her eyes trained on the floor below.</p><p> </p><p>Thirty minutes later, and they were docking again.</p><p> </p><p>The island café sat atop a small hill, just high enough that the breeze from the ocean could cool the heat of the sun on their skin. A string of pale umbrellas swayed overhead, casting soft shadows across tables set with painted ceramic plates and rustic wooden chairs. Jen looked perfectly at home as she led the way up some natural, cracked stairs toward a table with a clear view of the sparkling water. </p><p> </p><p>Alice stuck close by her side, sipping occasionally from a water bottle, her eyes not leaving the smooth line of Jen’s back.</p><p> </p><p><em> Okay. </em> Agatha thought, letting out a little laugh. <em> Those two are definitely something. </em></p><p> </p><p>Wanda was mid-sentence, something about her twin brother, Pietro, and their not-so awesome childhood summers in freezing Sokovia, when her phone buzzed in her hand. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, speak of the devil; it’s him.” She groaned, showing Agatha the name flashing on her screen. “It’ll be quick, I swear.”</p><p> </p><p>“Go.” Agatha said, brushing her hand against Wanda’s in parting. “Tell him I said hi.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda grinned and pressed a kiss to her cheek, then turned on her heel and jogged lightly back toward the boat. Agatha felt a twinge of guilt again, but it faded the moment she sat across from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, who wouldn’t stop it with the damn staring again. Her lips were curled up in what appeared to be a casual, calm grin — God, Agatha had been thinking about that mouth <em> nonstop </em>.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m starving.” Alice declared, flopping into the seat beside Jen with a loud sigh. “We didn’t eat enough on the boat.”</p><p> </p><p>“There’s a whole seafood platter with our names on it.” Jen said, already scanning the menu. She looked over at Agatha and Rio. “You two ever had grilled octopus fresh off the dock?”</p><p> </p><p>“Love it.” Rio said smoothly. “Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, catching up. “Oh. Yeah. Sure.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen leaned her elbows on the table, peach ice vape twirling between two fingers. “You and Wanda are so cute, by the way. She talked about you like… nonstop last night.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh?” Agatha let herself smile, trying to push past the ache in her stomach. “She did?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mhm. She showed me practically every photo in her camera roll last night,” Jen said with a laugh. “You two are, like, aesthetic. Very Mediterranean summer romance.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha forced another soft laugh.</p><p> </p><p> “Thanks.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice nudged Jen’s thigh under the table, grinning like she knew something.</p><p> </p><p>“What about you?” She asked. “Got a girlfriend back home?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen exhaled a puff of the peach-flavored vapor and tilted her head. “That ex I mentioned earlier. Kira. It ended a few months ago. But I’m open to whatever the wind blows in my direction.”</p><p> </p><p>That made Alice blush. Agatha caught it, but said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m gonna use the bathroom.” Rio said, pushing back her chair. “Be right back.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched her go, trying not to stare too obviously. But that was hard when Rio walked like she knew Agatha watched. Like she liked it.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Understandable. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Alice and Jen were still talking, somewhere between skincare routines and travel horror stories. Agatha’s phone buzzed in her lap. She opened it reflexively.</p><p> </p><p>Then almost dropped it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had sent her a selfie.</p><p> </p><p>Taken in the bathroom mirror. Her bikini top was pulled off, hanging loosely from one hand. Her breasts were bare, perked-up, the nipples hard from either the air conditioning or whatever the <em> hell </em> she was doing. Her mouth was parted slightly, her expression low-lidded and flushed. Beneath the image, a single message:</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> this is what you miss out on when you tease me, by the way. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. She squeezed her thighs together beneath the table.</p><p> </p><p>She typed fast.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : Are you fucking touching yourself right now? </em></p><p> </p><p>Three dots appeared. Then:</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> mhm </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> remembering what it was like to eat ur pussy </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> shit im really fucking wet baby </em></p><p> </p><p>Alice and Jen were still deep in conversation. Jen had taken out a little travel bottle of serum and was letting Alice smell it on her wrist, noses close together.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. Her fingers trembled as she typed:</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> Do not fucking come. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t respond right away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was trying very hard not to squirm in her seat.</p><p> </p><p>Then another text:</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> angel, don’t be like that </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> please? </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> If you come, you’re not touching me at all for the forseeable future.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t breathe. She reached for her wine and downed half the glass in one go.</p><p> </p><p>Jen looked over. “You okay, Aggie?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> That nickname better not stick, holy fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“You look kind of flushed.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. Uh, just kinda hot.” She forced a smile. “Island sun.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen smirked like she didn’t quite believe her.</p><p> </p><p>Her phone buzzed again.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> fuck fine </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> you still wanna see what you do to me baby? </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath and tapped out:</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> Obviously. </em></p><p> </p><p>A beat passed.</p><p> </p><p>Then, an incoming photo. </p><p> </p><p>Not much to see from the blurred background, but there was a clear shot of Rio’s distinct, agile fingers, absolutely soaked in her own arousal.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clenched the phone tightly in her palm and forced her eyes back on the table. Jen was now leaning closer to Alice, showing her something on her phone, and Alice had her chin resting in her hand, beaming.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn't focus. </p><p> </p><p>Not with the image of Rio topless, touching herself in a bathroom stall just a few feet away.</p><p> </p><p>Not with her whole body still buzzing from the memory of the night before. </p><p> </p><p>And <em> certainly </em> not with the growing, desperate ache between her legs that only one person seemed to know how to tend to.</p><p> </p><p>She glanced toward the café entrance, then down at her phone.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em>Alright.

<p>Here’s the thing.</p><p> </p><p>Was Agatha feeling a little bit… <em> insane </em> , after the things she’d done <em> not even a week </em> into her vacation? One might say that, yes.</p><p> </p><p>Meeting a stranger in a Grecian hotel, flirting with her, and eventually getting fucked by her three times over, whilst having a wife-to-be, wasn’t exactly the most typical thing one could experience.</p><p> </p><p>Sitting beside said-wife-to-be, and simultaneously across from said-stranger after having sexted the latter in the midst of a boat trip, was certainly something, too.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt insane. She felt weirdly out-of-body.</p><p> </p><p>It’s not like she was the most morally-sound person even before cheating on her fiancee. The furthest thing from a saint, to be totally clear.</p><p> </p><p>But something about Rio, about their… <em> situation, </em>felt uncanny in a manner Agatha couldn't place.</p><p> </p><p>And she was absolutely convinced she was about three minutes away from collapse; mentally and physically.</p><p> </p><p>She stared up at the large, white umbrella currently shading over the table, watching boredly as it fluttered in the breeze bouncing off the seawater.</p><p> </p><p>Anything to take her mind off of <em> it.</em> The situation that Agatha was decidedly <em> not </em>going to think about too much.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she focused on the smell of grilled octopus and lemon-y potatoes currently wafting in from the open-air kitchen of the restaurant.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda had returned from her phone call with a bounce in her step, sliding into the chair beside Agatha, nattering off something about Pietro and a mishap with his latest girlfriend’s pet gecko.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Whatever that means. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, sorry.” She said breathlessly, tucking her sunglasses into her neckline. “Lizard secured. Crisis semi-averted.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s good.” Alice smiled, swirling her wine distractedly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio returned a minute later.</p><p> </p><p>Cool and composed, taking a seat right across from Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Which could mean nothing.</p><p> </p><p>And if there was any indicator she’d just been in a bathroom with her suit top pulled down, touching herself as she texted an engaged acquaintance, she <em> certainly </em>didn’t show it.</p><p> </p><p>Still, the image was practically burned into Agatha’s retinas. Rio’s tits, tan and a little flushed, one hand raised to hold the phone while the other was very obviously stationed somewhere lower.</p><p> </p><p>Now that same hand was calmly resting beside a flute of water. Her fingers drumming absentmindedly against the sweating glass, scrubbed clean of any evidence by soap and a straightened spine.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s phone lit up again just as the waiter dropped off another round of spritzes. She snatched it up with a groan, read the message, and immediately let her head fall back against her chair.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” She muttered.</p><p> </p><p>“Pietro again?” Agatha asked, reaching for her own drink.</p><p> </p><p>“No. It’s about the wedding reception now. Something with the caterers. Apparently they’re confused about the welcome cocktail service and think we want it during dinner instead.”</p><p> </p><p>She sat up straight, rifling through her beach bag for her sunglasses. Agatha tried not to look so relieved. Really, she did.</p><p> </p><p>“I have to call the planner. I’m sorry, babe.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her expression neutral as Wanda leaned in to peck her on the cheek. </p><p> </p><p>“Go to the rock pool without me, baby. I’m sure you’ll love it.”</p><p> </p><p>And then she was off again, waving vaguely behind her, already deep in some half-frantic voicemail from her maid of honour.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move for a few seconds. Her skin felt warm in a way that wasn’t just the sun. She sipped her spritz, then checked her phone — no new messages from Rio. Across the table, she appeared to be busy listening to the way Alice and Jen were bouncing off each other, in a conversation Agatha had tuned out long ago.</p><p> </p><p>Then, Alice leaned back in her chair and stretched dramatically.</p><p> </p><p>“I think I need to lie down somewhere with sand and alcohol and absolutely no men around.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen grinned. “Awww. That’s the most <em> romantic </em> thing anyone’s ever said to me.”</p><p> </p><p>“C’mon, gorgeous.” Alice smirked back, standing and grabbing a bottle of imported wine from the table. “We’re going beachside.”</p><p> </p><p>They clattered off together like they <em> hadn’t </em>just met last night, leaving Agatha blinking in their wake, her wine glass still half-full and her thighs sticking unpleasantly to the cushion.</p><p> </p><p>“Well.” Came that very familiar, low voice from across the table. “I can’t very well let a lady go clambering over coastal rock formations all alone, can I?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked up. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had stood up at some point, and was now brushing nonexistent sand from her shorts. Her sunglasses were back on, casting her face in cool, impenetrable shadow. She had the stance of somebody who might’ve worked at the resort, that trademark plastered-on customer service smile.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Do not think about her tits. Do not think about her texts. Do not think about her arms. </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> You guys </em> <b> <em>just </em> </b> <em> sexted. </em></p><p> </p><p><em> You are not </em> <b> <em>that </em> </b> <em> horny, Harkness. </em></p><p> </p><p>“You do know you don’t actually work here.” Agatha said, half-smiling despite herself.</p><p> </p><p>“True.” Rio replied. “But if you slipped and broke your ankle on a jagged boulder, I’d feel morally responsible. Plus, I know the path, I got a map with me. Oh, <em> and </em>I’m good with sharp things.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and stood. “That’s a deeply concerning sentence, but sure. Let’s go.”</p><p> </p><p>The path sloped upward behind the restaurant, veering into sun-bleached rock and dry brush. Rio led the way, the curve of her back shifting beneath the top of her half-covered swimsuit as she navigated the uneven stone trail. Agatha followed, trying not to feel like she was in some erotic Greek fever dream.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Technically, was it a fever dream if she’d… consciously acted on those fantasies a mere ten minutes ago? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Distracting herself, Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“This is very Mamma Mia 2.” She said lightly, if only to break the silence and steady herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced over her shoulder, amused. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that the one where Cher shows up and annoys everyone in a pantsuit?”</p><p> </p><p>“Correct. Ten out of ten.”</p><p> </p><p>“Excellent. I call Cher.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, of course.”</p><p> </p><p>They rounded a bend and the sea revealed itself again — deep and sparkling and stupidly beautiful. </p><p> </p><p>Below, nestled in a little rock cradle, was the pool: Rio didn’t hesitate to pick up a pebble resting on the rockside, feigning a basketball dunk and dropping it in for whatever reason.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a small sigh.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned and cocked a brow. “Something to say, gorgeous?”</p><p> </p><p>“So immature.” Agatha grinned, already pulling her dress off over her head.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate once she did that; just yanked her linen pants off in one clean motion. Her suit was gorgeous and <em> okay, yeah, incredibly familiar </em>, and her body was — well, not that Agatha was looking, but it was a lot. Sinewy. Strong. Tanned all over. The line of her hip flexors could’ve cut glass.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned quickly and stepped into the water to cool off. Before she did something rash, like mounting Rio’s thigh. </p><p> </p><p><em> Again </em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, sure.” Rio said from behind her. “Just walk away from that compliment I was about to give you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced back at her. “Was it going to be deeply inappropriate?”</p><p> </p><p>“Duh.”</p><p> </p><p>They swam.</p><p> </p><p>The water was warm at the top and cold at the bottom, the kind that forced little gasps out of you when it hit your ribs. They dunked under, resurfaced drenched with seawater and grinning.</p><p> </p><p>At one point, Rio did a terrible backflip off one of the side rocks and nearly belly-flopped. Agatha laughed so hard she choked and snorted in <em> such an attractive fashion </em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Why the hell would you think that’d work?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t make me come over there, gorgeous.” Rio shook her head, pointing right at Agatha before attempting another flip into the water.</p><p> </p><p>Another belly-flop.</p><p> </p><p>When they were breathless and bobbing near the middle, sun soaking into their skin, Rio floated closer and seemed like she was… musing.</p><p> </p><p>“You gonna tell me how you ended up with her?”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. She tried for indifference. “Didn’t Wanda tell you this story the day we met?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure. But I wanna hear your side of the story. Spare me no detail.”</p><p> </p><p>“We met at a dinner party.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised a brow, and when Agatha didn’t continue speaking, she tried to hide a smirk by poking her tongue into the side of her cheek. </p><p> </p><p>“That sounds boring. And not like you, to be honest. A dinner party? Really?”</p><p> </p><p>“I know.”</p><p> </p><p>A beat of silence.</p><p> </p><p>“You… don’t seem like you like her that much.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tread water a little harder. “Excuse me?”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, you don’t talk about her like people talk about someone they love. You talk about her like a paper cut you’ve learned to live with.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t reply.</p><p> </p><p>The silence stretched between them for much longer now, warm and wet and humid. And shockingly not as awkward as one might assume.</p><p> </p><p>“I know.” Rio said eventually, quieter this time. “None of my business.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swam for the rock edge. “No, it’s not.”</p><p> </p><p>But her heart was beating faster than the exertion warranted, and she wasn’t entirely sure what she was swimming away from.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t follow immediately. She lingered in the water, giving Agatha space, letting it all sit there for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Agatha pulled herself up to sit on the warm flat stone near the pool’s edge, knees held gently to her chest, sun drying the salt on her skin. Rio hauled herself up beside her, stretching out without a care in the world.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t speak for a minute. Agatha listened to the sound of the waves lapping gently at the rock, the occasional seagull, the susurration of leaves from the trees that overhung the pool.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was very aware of the fact that she was almost entirely naked and alone with someone who made her feel like her brain was full of static. And yet, somehow, she didn’t feel unsafe. She felt…</p><p> </p><p><em> How </em> <b> <em>did </em> </b> <em> she feel? </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha spared a glance over at her accompaniment.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was lying back on her elbows, eyes closed, hair dripping onto the rock. Her mouth was parted slightly. She looked good. So hot.</p><p> </p><p>Not just hot. Not just fuckable. She looked… <em> handsome </em>, Agatha reasoned. And then her stomach lurched with something that wasn’t quite lust.</p><p> </p><p>She looked away instantly. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Nope.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t going to do that. Not here. Not today. She was not going to start thinking of Rio in some… sentimental way.</p><p> </p><p>It was just a sex high. Just endorphins. Just the sheer rush of having let a total stranger fuck her in a way she didn’t let anyone else, made her come so hard she thought she’d lucked out and somehow transcended into Elysium.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey.” Rio murmured, not opening her eyes. “You okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha forced a smile. “Yeah. Just… warm.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well.” Rio sat up slowly. “Want to get warmer?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth dried. Now that was definitely a bad idea. A stupid, reckless, godless idea, one might say.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio’s hand slipped over the rock to slide along Agatha’s thigh, damp yet confident. Like she knew Agatha would say yes.</p><p> </p><p>“How are you <em> still </em>horny?” Agatha grinned, though Rio didn’t miss the way she shamelessly spread her legs a little wider, coaxing Rio’s hand lower with the movement.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m in the presence of a beautiful woman who knows what she wants, and is <em> learning </em>to take instead of give.”</p><p> </p><p>Shifting to allow her hand to slip even lower, Rio ended up on her knees between Agatha’s spread legs, resting back on them as she continued to speak.</p><p> </p><p>“Plus. She’s got, like, really pretty tits.” Agatha barked out a laugh, and Rio’s smile somehow got even bigger. “And her ass? I mean, <em> fuck </em>, Jesus Christ–“</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, you demon, tone it down. You already got into my pants. Several times.”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you think I’m trying to do now?” Rio said, raising a brow. Her fingers squeezed the meat of Agatha’s thigh just lightly, eliciting a sharp intake of breath from her.</p><p> </p><p>She leaned in a little more, nosing at Agatha’s collarbone to press a gentle kiss there.</p><p> </p><p>“Where do you want me, baby?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p> </p><p>She took a few more breaths, building up to what she really wanted. Finally, she threw in the towel; slid her hand up to clasp around Rio’s neck, guiding her head back and squeezing gently.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes, already a rich brown on their own, were now inky pools of black as she stared at Agatha like she was two seconds away from jumping her.</p><p> </p><p>She made a point of squeezing Rio’s throat again. Dipped her thumb into the pulse point.</p><p> </p><p>“Take off my panties.”</p><p> </p><p>When Rio started to reach down, she squeezed tighter.</p><p> </p><p>“With your teeth.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin couldn't've been bigger.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p> </p><p>Without breaking eye contact, Rio leaned in closer, her breath warm on Agatha’s cooling skin. She took the edge of the bikini bottoms in her teeth and tugged gently.</p><p> </p><p>The panties clung to Agatha’s hips as she pulled, dragging down slowly and teasingly. Agatha’s eyes were trained on the fabric between Rio’s teeth, her breath hitching as Rio’s lips grazed the sensitive flesh of her inner thigh.</p><p> </p><p>She dragged it down the length of both her thighs, past her knees, and Agatha helped by shimmying her feet through until Rio got them off all the way and dropped them carelessly to the rock below.</p><p> </p><p>“Good boy.” Agatha murmured, stroking the side of Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes flickered up at the praise, something unreadable passing over her features before she leaned in closer.</p><p> </p><p>“What now, baby?” She mused into the skin of Agatha’s palm, kissing the skin as though it were delicate.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha thought about it for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>She took a deep breath, her eyes drifting over the horizon for a brief second. Then, she smiled.</p><p> </p><p>“Lie down.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile grew a little wider, a little more predatory, as she laid back on the rock, wet locks of hair sticking to her skin as she arranged herself comfortably.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart was hammered in her chest, her breath shallow as she stared at Rio’s face. How she was so pliable, so willing, so eager to do any fucking thing Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha then moved; carefully, lifting her thighs and situating both knees at the side of Rio’s head. Her drenched cunt hovered over Rio’s mouth, and she preened at the way Rio appeared to still be holding herself back, awaiting Agatha’s instruction as if her intentions weren’t clear as day.</p><p> </p><p>“Open your mouth,” Agatha whispered, and Rio obeyed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took another deep breath and finally lowered herself onto Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“Be a good boy, and eat my pussy.”</p><p> </p><p>The words barely left Agatha’s lips before Rio’s mouth was on her, eager and hungry.</p><p> </p><p>She nearly folded in on herself as Rio’s tongue swiped through her slit, tasting and savoring every inch of her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hips rolled of their own accord, pushing down into the warmth of that mouth, the softness of those lips. The pressure was just right: not too much, not too gentle. Rio groaned into her cunt, and the vibrations sent a shock of pleasure straight to Agatha’s neglected clit.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers curled into Rio’s hair, grasping handfuls as she began to grind down, setting a rhythm that Rio eagerly followed.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Mfgh </em>— yes, that’s it… that’s it, baby.” Agatha moaned, her eyes sliding shut as Rio’s tongue delved deeper into her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands slithered around Agatha’s thighs, pulling her closer, holding her in place as she devoured her. The wet sounds of her mouth filled the air around them, punctuated by Agatha’s increasingly loud gasps.</p><p> </p><p>She laved through the slickness, the tip of her tongue flicking and teasing at Agatha’s clit, swirling and suckling until Agatha was bucking her hips, her moans reaching <em> just </em> too loud for such a public space. The saltwater from their swim had somehow made her taste sweeter, and Rio greedily drank it all in.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, you taste so good.” Rio’s muffled voice was barely discernible, as she barely took the time to speak before slipping off into another grunt of exertion from working her tongue and her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah? You like that?” Agatha’s voice was practically dripping with pleasured smugness, and she watched with hooded eyes as Rio nodded her head, eyes closed and very obviously lost in the taste of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Rio then doubled down on her actions; she lapped feverishly, dragging her nose and mouth up and down, before taking Agatha’s clit into her mouth once again and sucking. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head tipped back, her spine arching involuntarily as Rio’s tongue curled and laved over her clit in time with her suckles.</p><p> </p><p>“S-shit… <em> fuck </em>— I’m gonna come.” Agatha panted, her whole body tensing up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered open, and she stared up at Agatha as she pulled away ever so slightly.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I use my fingers, baby?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to slap Rio for stopping upon realising what she’d actually asked. Her teeth sunk into her bottom lip as she nodded her head, fingers tightening in Rio’s hair from the anticipation.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” Agatha breathed out. “Use your fingers, Rio."</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile was the last thing she saw before her eyes slammed shut again. Two of those talented digits slid into her without any resistance, curling and stroking her inner walls, while her tongue returned to Agatha’s clit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s knees quivered as she fought not to collapse onto Rio’s face entirely. She was so close; her grinding grew a touch rougher, less rhythmic.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t think about the fact they were in public in that moment. Didn’t think about her fiancee, off talking to the caterers of the wedding that’d take place in just under a month. Didn’t think about the fact that she was about to come on the fingers and the tongue of a woman she wouldn’t be saying ‘I do’ to any time soon.</p><p> </p><p>No. Instead, all she thought about was—</p><p> </p><p>“I’m coming— fuck, Rio! I’m coming!” Agatha’s voice cracked, the words torn from her throat against her will.</p><p> </p><p>She cried out: a high-pitched, choked-off moan type of noise, as her body tightened and then released. Her cunt clamped down on Rio's fingers, her clit pulsed against Rio’s tongue, and her hips rutted feral-like into Rio’s face as she came.</p><p> </p><p>Those few moments were pure, utter ecstasy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel her thighs shaking from the force of it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands were the only thing keeping her upright as she huffed and groaned, teetering into overstimulation. Her hands were like vices in Rio’s hair, and she let out a final, pushed-out breath before slumping down, completely fucked out.</p><p> </p><p>She had no idea how long it’d taken, how long she’d been attempting to recover.</p><p> </p><p>Somehow, Rio used her strength to lift Agatha up gently, just enough to slide herself upward and out from underneath Agatha’s quivering cunt. She used her elbows to wiggle herself up, allowing herself to carefully take hold of Agatha’s thighs and sit her down into Rio’s lap.</p><p> </p><p>It could’ve been two minutes — could’ve been two hours, really — but Agatha finally regained some semblance of composure. She sat up, lifting her head from where it’d been resting in the crook of Rio’s neck, and, unfortunately, immediately found her eyes drifting down to Rio’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>They were parted for breath. Her chin was positively shining with Agatha’s juices; she hadn’t bothered to wipe it off.</p><p> </p><p>“How was that, angel?” She smiled, softer than before.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her cheeks flushing as she looked down at Rio, whose eyes were gleaming with satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p>No. <em> No, no, no. </em></p><p> </p><p>Her heart fluttered again. In that odd, affectionate way again.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Absolutely not.</p><p> </p><p>She ignored it. Shoved it down.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> For Christ’s sake, they didn’t even know each other. It’d been four fucking days. She didn’t even know Rio’s middle name. Rio didn’t even know Agatha’s. It was just a fluke. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She reached up, patting Rio’s cheek with a nod.</p><p> </p><p>“Good boy.”</p>

<p>
<span>Agatha didn’t see Rio once for the next two days.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t necessarily intentional. It wasn’t unwanted, either.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She and Wanda just happened to get up a little earlier in the day, and head down to breakfast earlier than Rio and Alice typically would in the four days they’d known them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They didn’t see them at the pool or at dinner on those days either, since Wanda had booked them a visit to Parthenon the first day and a club crawl through the city on the second.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Getting shit-faced in a drag bar in Athens had been a </span>
<em>
<span>really </span>
</em>
<span>good distractor, to be fair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had nursed a heap of those freakishly-fruity cocktails the entire night, going along with Wanda’s speed; how she shamelessly whooped, cheered, danced in her seat as the queens performed on the big stage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They passed through two more clubs, and Agatha’s head was fuzzy in the most perfect of ways.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She could hear the club’s track pulsing through its’ huge speakers, feel the bass actually thumping through her body, as she loosely kept a hand around Wanda’s waist as her fiancée ground back into her in sync with the beat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A few more drinks after that they’d finally stumbled out of the club, and Agatha actually found herself </span>
<em>
<span>giggling </span>
</em>
<span>as Wanda almost fell over after running right into an overhanging pride flag and mistaking it for a wall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They’d flagged down a taxi, endured the bumpy ride back to the hotel, and Agatha was pleasantly surprised when she found herself pushed up against the door to their room once inside.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda’s mouth found hers messily, and Agatha moaned as her hands didn’t hesitate to slip around the small of her back, dipping to her ass and squeezing indulgently.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck– want you–” She’d whispered through kisses, dragging Agatha over to the bed and flicking off her heels haphazardly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The room was filled with the sounds of their heavy breathing, the tug of Wanda’s zipper down her back, the shucking-off of her dress. She dropped down to sit right at the edge of the bed, hooking her legs around the backs of Agatha’s thighs to pull her closer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m so wet for you, baby.” Wanda moaned again, chasing Agatha’s mouth and grinding against the exposed sliver of stomach, thanks to Agatha’s beltline having fallen down in the midst of their kisses and grabs and stripping.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was ready. She wanted this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She did, actually.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Maybe she just needed a reminder of why they got together in the first place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>(</span>
<em>
<span>Their first time having sex had, in fact, been upstairs at the aforementioned dinner party where they’d first met. Agatha was already on an ego trip from work that day – selling three paintings in one day will do that to a person – and the way Wanda had come twice on her tongue, panting and shaking on top of the sink counter, had been addicting. Intoxicating. Agatha swore she was horny for a month straight after the fact.</span>
</em>
<span>)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But she also knew she needed to feel something too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That much had been clear within the last four days – how she’d learned, very quickly, how much she actually liked someone’s tongue and fingers inside of her, coaxing her to orgasm. How she’d found out, scarily fast, that she actually preferred to receive over give.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So, when Wanda made a move to tug Agatha’s hand downward, almost slipping it beneath her pantyline, Agatha pulled back from the kiss breathily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can… can you fuck me, tonight?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For a moment, Agatha was worried it came out… weird. The words felt strange on her tongue, but they were out now, and bottling it up wouldn’t’ve helped whatsoever.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda wasn’t deterred. She did pause for a second, sure, but very quickly a smile spread on her face, and she dragged Agatha back in for another kiss.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You want my fingers, sweetie?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She whispered it low, accompanied it with sliding her own hand down the front of Agatha’s pants, cupping her directly over her increasingly-wet panties with a pleased giggle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, wrenching off her bra like it’d personally offended her, and easily slid into Wanda’s lap when the redhead’s free hand guided her to sit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wanna ride ‘em.” Agatha whispered back, pressing her chest forward to push Wanda until she was laid back, all the while with her hand trapped beneath the dual-layer of fabric.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck, you’re so hot.” Wanda slurred out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her fingers hooked into the seam of Agatha’s panties and pulled them aside, before sliding a single digit inside. The motion had Agatha clenching around the intrusion with a startled moan, and the feeling only worsened deliciously when Wanda’s mouth began seeking out the underside of her tit, dragging her teeth along the flesh before taking a hardened nipple into her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>God</span>
</em>
<span>. Oh shi– yeah, keep going.” Agatha’s voice was thick with desire as Wanda’s finger moved within her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The redhead’s eyes were half-lidded with lust, her pupils blown wide with the desire Agatha had sparked in her. She didn’t need further encouragement. Wanda’s other hand trailed up Agatha’s spine, her thumb tracing the line of her backbone until it reached her neck, then curling around to cup her cheek.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re so wet, baby. You’re dripping all over my hand.” Wanda murmured, nosing over to the other tit and dragging the flat of her tongue over Agatha’s nipple languidly. “So… so </span>
<em>
<span>fuckin’ wet</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes rolled back in her head, a soft moan escaping her as she ground down on the intrusion, trying to take her deeper. Wanda’s thumb found her clit, circling it gently before pressing down and rubbing it in rhythm with her finger’s movements.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s thoughts swirled, trying to keep them on Wanda… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Rio’s face kept popping into her mind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Those seeking, warm eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>How she’d looked at Agatha like she was the sun and the moon and every star in the sky, all rolled into one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The way her tongue had felt sliding into her, the way Agatha had felt herself clench around it–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No. </span>
<em>
<span>Wanda</span>
</em>
<span>. Wanda was the one Agatha was with now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched as Wanda’s thumb rubbed her clit with more pressure, her hips rolling in a silent plea for more. The room was filled with their ragged breathing, the soft slap of skin on skin, the sound of Wanda’s finger sliding in and out of her wetness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“More, more, baby.” Agatha begged, her voice strained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But, during her distraction, Wanda’s movements had slowed to a crawl, and Agatha’s eyes fluttered open in frustration mixed with confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda’s head was lolling to the side, eyes closed, and she was snoring lightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nearly screamed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stared down in disbelief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Watched as her fiancée's chest rose and fell with each heavy snore. The alcohol had claimed Wanda mid-act, leaving Agatha straddling her, desperate for release, aching to be touched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you…” She trailed off, cutting herself off with a scoff. “Seriously?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nothing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hauled herself up. Felt Wanda’s slack fingers leave her cunt, and she didn’t stay long enough to gauge if Wanda had any reaction in her slumber.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hurried into the bathroom, trying to compose herself as she turned on the shower, allowing the noise to fill the room as she took a seat on top of the sink counter. Steam curled up the mirror as Agatha sat, bare thighs sticking uncomfortably to the cold marble of the sink counter, still reeling from the fact that Wanda, in the middle of fingering her, had passed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wasn’t angry, not really. They’d both drank a shit ton of vodka, and Wanda had always been a lightweight. But still… now?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The ache between her legs was now dulled by irritation. It wasn’t just about the loss of an orgasm; Agatha respected that she certainly wouldn’t be getting one tonight, not by Wanda’s hand at least.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was the loss of momentum. The build-up. The frustration of Wanda somehow still not quite seeing her, not in the way Agatha needed. Not lately.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After several minutes of sitting under the weak white glow of the bathroom lights, she exhaled, grabbed a towel, and padded softly across the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda remained fast asleep, sprawled diagonally across the bed like she owned every inch of it. Her mouth hung open slightly, her lipstick smudged, her gorgeous hair mussed from where Agatha had had her fingers buried in it. She looked peaceful. Maybe even beautiful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t feel peaceful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pulled on a loose white button-up and a pair of black sleep shorts that clung softly to her hips, trying not to dwell on the lack of underwear. Her thighs were still sticky. She briefly considered returning to the bathroom for a rinse, but then opted instead for the balcony door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The air outside hit her instantly; warm, salty, something to easily get used to. She lit a cigarette with a practiced flick of her thumb on the lighter and leaned forward on the railing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A few seconds passed before she heard the familiar sound of a vape clicking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Couldn’t sleep either?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her head. Alice stood on the other side of the shared balcony divide, nursing her peach-ice vape like it was coffee. She looked tired, but comfortable. Her sleep shirt was oversized and hung off one shoulder, and splashed across the chest was the familiar sight of </span>
<em>
<span>Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours </span>
</em>
<span>album cover. She gave Agatha a small smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Or…” Alice waved vaguely with the vape. “You’re avoiding the snoring?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted through her nose, taking a long drag. “Am I that obvious?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You and Wanda had fun at the club, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, yeah.” Agatha replied dryly. “We danced. We drank. She passed out on top of me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice’s eyebrows shot up, amused. “Hot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“In fairness, it was kind of hot. Until she started snoring with her hand still inside my pants.” Agatha chuckled lowly and let the smoke escape through her nose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice barked a laugh, clearly trying not to be too loud. “Oh my God. Poor you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They lapsed into a quiet pause, only broken by the soft fizzing of Alice’s vape, the barely-there crackle of Agatha’s cigarette, and the occasional ocean breeze shaking the railing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> “She really does adore you, you know.” Alice mused, tilting her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tensed slightly. The words landed with an odd weight, pressing right down onto Agatha’s chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean it. She was talking about you during breakfast the other morning before you two disappeared into Athens. Said she couldn’t believe she was marrying you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That sounds like her.” Agatha forced a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You… okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She took a beat. Flicked ash off the edge of the balcony. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah. Just tired.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mhm.” Alice didn’t seem convinced, but she didn’t push it either. Instead, she leaned her forearms on the railing beside her. “You know, I was supposed to get married once.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up at that, genuinely surprised. “Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Years ago. She was sweet. Practical. Reliable as hell. Good job. Family adored her. Everything on paper said I should go through with it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I kept hesitating. Putting off picking the venue. Finding reasons to delay. Told myself it was the stress. Or the money. Or my commitment issues.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed lowly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But it wasn’t.” Alice continued. “It was that I didn’t love her the way she loved me. And deep down, I knew it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t say it with regret. If anything, it was gentle. Like she’d made peace with it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you… call it off?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Three weeks before the date. It was awful at the time. But better than waking up five years down the line next to someone you feel guilty around every day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed thickly. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck</span>
</em>
<span>. The weight seemed to double and crack its’ way through her ribs, right to her heart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah. That… makes sense.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They shared another moment of silence, and Alice leaned closer, nudging her shoulder. “So. I’m just gonna ask. Are you happy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wanda’s kind. Funny. She loves me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s not what I asked.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her cigarette like it might hold the answer. “I do. I’m just… I feel different about it now, compared to the earlier days.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice blew a stream of peach-scented vapor out toward the sky. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to know right now.” Then she shifted gears slightly. “Y’know… Rio used to be worse at this stuff than me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Relationships?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mm.” Alice scratched her head as she chuckled with familiarity. “I don’t think she’s ever been in love. Not really. Had a few girlfriends, but they didn’t stick.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That surprised Agatha. Something about Rio felt so sure. She seemed like the committed type.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Huh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s great, though,” Alice added quickly. “Don’t get me wrong. One of the most loyal people I’ve ever met. She’d literally walk through fire for her friends. Just… I dunno. She always got scared with girlfriends. Or maybe she doesn’t even realize when it’s happening. Something about her always being the one left behind growing up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha processed this slowly. The knowledge felt oddly private, like she shouldn’t be hearing it, and yet she was clinging to every word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So what happened? With the last girlfriend?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio ended it. Said she wasn’t feeling it. The girl was devastated. I tried to tell her not to get attached too fast but…” She trailed off. “I guess some people just do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach twisted. She imagined herself being discarded. Wondered, sharply, if Rio could ever look at her and just decide she was done.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That shouldn’t hurt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because this wasn’t a relationship.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They were simply fucking on the sly. It was chemistry. A fun time, with no strings attached, supposedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Still, her voice was quieter than before when she asked, “Does she… talk about that stuff? Her past, I mean.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rarely.” Alice said. “But you get little bits if you’re patient. And if you don’t push.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That… made sense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice turned to head back in, but she lingered in the doorway just long enough to leave one last remark hanging between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Whatever you’re thinking about right now… just be honest with yourself. I’m sure you’re happy with Wanda. But if there’s doubt? It’s better to think it over, even if it hurts to do so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And with that, she disappeared inside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha remained on the balcony, the cigarette now cold between her fingers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wasn’t sure how long she stood there, staring into the night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But when she finally moved, it was to fish her phone from the pocket of her sleep shorts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A single, unopened message from Rio was waiting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>rio: you up? </b>
</p><p>
<b>rio: thought i heard u talking on the balcony</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply, thumb hovering over the keyboard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>agatha: yeah. everything’s fine</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not really, though. Because Agatha was still reeling. She needed something, exactly what; she didn’t know. But she figured it couldn’t hurt to indulge, just one more time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She tapped away at the keyboard once again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>agatha: im heading down to the beach. come meet me there</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hit send.</span>

<p>The red bikini had been a gamble.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had stood in front of the mirror, biting her lip as she adjusted the tiny triangles over her tits. The top didn’t cover much, and the bottoms were practically ribbons strung together at her hips, but something in her had needed to feel this. </p><p> </p><p>Feel like she was wanted.</p><p> </p><p>She could still hear Wanda’s soft snores in the bed.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha wasn’t a monster, and she’d deigned to leave a glass of water and painkillers on the nightstand beside her, just before leaving. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Now, sprawled out on the cabana’s cushioned bed under the wash of moonlight, she felt Rio’s eyes on her before she even heard her.</p><p> </p><p>“Holy shit.” Rio muttered behind her. “You’re going to give someone a heart attack.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t turn her head, not yet. She tilted her chin up instead, letting the breeze carry her hair back, her skin shimmering faintly with the remnants of coconut oil she’d splashed on in the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>“Who, me?” She said airily, and smiled at Rio’s low whistle. </p><p> </p><p>“I thought the navy one from the other day was hot, but this?” She stepped into view, hands in the pockets of her khaki shorts, the sleeves of her shirt rolled up high on her forearms. “This is just mean.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grinned. “I debated wearing green.”</p><p> </p><p>“Green would’ve killed me.”</p><p> </p><p>She finally looked at her. Rio was watching her like she was something between art and dessert; equal parts reverent and ravenous. It made Agatha’s stomach twist in the best, most delicious way.</p><p> </p><p>“You look good too.” Agatha said, letting her eyes trail deliberately down Rio’s figure. “Very… <em> daddy </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio coughed. “God. You’re gonna make me walk straight into the sea.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed, and the sound felt un-forced for once.</p><p> </p><p>Rio joined her in the cabana, sitting beside her, one leg tucked up, one foot stretched out. Her knee brushed Agatha’s thigh.</p><p> </p><p>“So.” Rio said after a pause. “How was your night?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a noise. “That depends. Are you asking emotionally or physically?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned. “Let’s go with physically first.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, stretching her arms up over her head, ribs shifting under the thin red fabric. “I’m… processing. I don’t know. I thought maybe sex would fix things with Wanda — like, rekindle something. We were fucking. Or, well, about to fuck – specifically, she was finally about to fuck <em> me </em>for once."</p><p> </p><p>Rio just nodded, listening intently.</p><p> </p><p>“And she passed out. Mid-fingering me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wow.” Rio whistled. Then nodded again. “Okay. Wow.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, dragging her hands down her face. “It’s not even just that. I’m not mad at the loss of sex – we were both smashed. But I’ve sobered up now, and it’s… everything. The lies. The tension. The pretending. I feel like I’m… pouring from an empty cup and everyone just failed to notice it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded slowly. “You’re still holding onto some guilt, I take it.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s heavy. This… thing we’re doing, I don’t exactly go about cheating on my fiancee lightly.”</p><p> </p><p>Saying it, saying that damned c-word, didn’t seem to perturb Rio as much as it did Agatha. Which made sense, of course – Rio wasn’t the one who’d promised herself to a whole other person. Promised to be a loyal, loving partner.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t the one pretending to be either of those things.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever.” Agatha grunted, shrugging her shoulders back. “I really don’t want to think about it right now. Or talk, either.”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, it might help if you did–”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>She looked up from the sand, and found Agatha looking at her with an almost-pleading look. Agatha didn’t say anything else, just shook her head lightly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. Gave her a small smile.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers trailed across the curve of Agatha’s thigh, light and teasing. </p><p> </p><p>“You know what <em> else </em>is heavy?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Your sexual frustration. It’s practically radiating off you in waves. I mean, I know you said the lost sex didn’t bother you – but you can always… find it somewhere else, hm?”</p><p> </p><p>She turned her head toward Rio, squinting. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re such an asshole.”</p><p> </p><p>“An observant asshole.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but couldn’t help the smile that curled at the corners of her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>“I should slap you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please do. I might moan.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted and shook her head, trying to ignore the thrill that shot through her as Rio’s hand found the tie of her bikini bottom, fingers curling around the string.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re killing me in this, you know. This little red number. <em> Fuck </em>.” Rio’s voice dropped lower. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth went dry almost instantly.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Stupid fucking sexy voice of Rio’s, be damned. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You’d have liked the green.” She offered, trying in vain to play coy.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in closer, her lips brushing the shell of her ear. “Maybe. But red’s totally my favourite colour now.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re full of shit.” Agatha swallowed thickly. </p><p> </p><p>“Nah.” Her teeth grazed her lobe. “I mean it.”</p><p> </p><p>She kissed along the line of Agatha’s neck, slow and maddening. Agatha’s body went hot under the cool night air, and she felt that tell-tale coiling, low in her belly.</p><p> </p><p>“You know.” Rio murmured, her hand slowly beginning to untie one side of Agatha’s bikini bottoms. “This cabana’s public. Maybe we shouldn’t...”</p><p> </p><p>“Barely.” Agatha whispered in protest, squirming as the knot came undone. “It’s private enough.”</p><p> </p><p>“That so?” Rio undid the other side, the flimsy fabric fluttering against Agatha’s thigh.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned onto her stomach, the move languid and deliberate, her ass bare now, all but inviting.</p><p> </p><p>“Touch me.” She said, voice thick with need. “And don’t make me ask again.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled hard.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus Christ, woman.”</p><p> </p><p>Her hand settled on the curve of Agatha’s ass, her palm warm and fingers firm enough to make Agatha’s heart race. </p><p> </p><p>“You really want this? Right here?” She murmured, squeezing for her own pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked back at Rio over her shoulder, eyes half-lidded. “I’ve been wanting you since I fucking met you. Now, be a good boy, and fucking touch me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s expression darkened with hunger. “Fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>She leaned down again, kissing a slow path down Agatha’s spine, pausing to bite gently at her lower back as her hands moved up to grip her waist.</p><p> </p><p>“Say it again.” Rio mumbled against her skin.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha rasped.</p><p> </p><p>“That you want me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. “I want you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curved into a grin against her skin. “Shit. You’re so perfect, angel.”</p><p> </p><p>And there it was again; the way Agatha’s stomach flipped at the words, the heat that spread up her spine like a wildfire.</p><p> </p><p>“You look so beautiful like this…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flushed heavily — she felt embarrassed as a whimper fought its way out of her throat, letting her eyes slip shut and her head tip forward into a pillow perched at the head of the cabana bed. </p><p> </p><p>She felt Rio’s hands slip from her waist, moving to grab ahold of both ass cheeks this time, and her eyes shot open again when Rio spread them, moaning to herself.</p><p> </p><p>“So wet… so pretty… my cock would probably look so snug in here. Don’t you agree, baby?” Rio mused, teeth sunken into her bottom lip as she languidly dragged her thumb through the gathered, glistening wetness along Agatha’s slit.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio… fuck me, now.” She grunted, grinding back in the vain hope of more contact. </p><p> </p><p>“Say please, sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck– fine, <em> please </em>!” Agatha whined, shifting her hips back to wiggle right against Rio’s crotch.</p><p> </p><p>She heard the tell-tale sound of fabric shifting, and whined again as she heard Rio standing. The scrape of her heel digging into sand, the soft creak of the leather strap being adjusted.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw nearly dropped, and she grinned like she’d just won the lottery.</p><p> </p><p>"You’re wearing it again." She said quietly, not even bothering to phrase it as a question.</p><p> </p><p>"Put it on the minute I got your text." Rio replied. "Had a feeling this’d happen."</p><p> </p><p>"That’s either really cocky or really romantic."</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned down, breath ghosting over her ear. “You want me to say which it is?”</p><p> </p><p>"No." Agatha smirked, eyes still closed. "I want you to fucking use it, sweet boy."</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. She stood still for just a second, like the words had knocked her backwards with force.</p><p> </p><p>Then she knelt back onto the cabana behind Agatha, situated herself behind her again, and Agatha moaned a little louder now when Rio shamelessly tugged her back so her ass was flush with Rio’s hips once again.</p><p> </p><p>"Tell me how."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s skin prickled. </p><p> </p><p>"Don’t stop. Just… fuck me until I tap out, baby."</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed the back of her neck, nodding. “Fuck, you’re perfect.”</p><p> </p><p>There was a pause. Agatha’s ears pricked-up at the sound of spit, a staggered grunt torn from her throat at the glide of fingers between her thighs again, and then her eyes literally rolled back as she felt the cool silicone pressed blunt against her.</p><p> </p><p>"You ready?" Rio murmured.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer with words. She pushed back against it, grinding her hips invitingly.</p><p> </p><p>That was enough.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grunted softly and slipped her cock inside. The fullness already had Agatha’s face buried into the crook of her elbow, in an attempt to muffle the involuntary noises threatening to spill out of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>"You look so damn sexy for me." Rio whispered. "Taking me so <em> fucking </em>deep. You know that?"</p><p> </p><p>"Mm– shut up, <em> harder </em>." Agatha bit out, but the tremble in her voice betrayed her.</p><p> </p><p>"Bossy." Rio muttered, and thrust her hips forward as her hand slid around to grip Agatha’s tit, her fingers moving to tease a nipple already stiff from the sea air. “I like hearing you baby. What’re you hiding those noises for?”</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t– you know I’m t-too loud.” Agatha growled, and Rio let out a breathless laugh, sliding out and then thrusting back in, her cock bottoming out and causing Agatha to have to bite down on her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>“God, you’re mean.”</p><p> </p><p>“You like that too."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha arched her back as Rio began to set out a deep, fast pace. She held Agatha’s hip in one hand, guiding Agatha to meet her as she pumped her cock in and out. The tip was reaching so deep, so hard with each thrust, and Agatha brokenly moaned as a hand reached out to grab ahold of the pillow near the edge of the bed.</p><p> </p><p>“Un-under my h-hips.” She barely managed to get out, and Rio couldn’t’ve been quicker to guide Agatha’s hips up, getting her on her knees before pushing her down into the bed by the small of her back – now propped up and bent in a perfect fashion over the pillow.</p><p> </p><p>The next thrust made her gasp.</p><p> </p><p>And the next made her moan.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, angel. That feel good?” Rio mused, thrusting even harder to make a point, filling Agatha with her cock until she felt she might burst.</p><p> </p><p>“Mfgh– y-yeah. More, Rio!” Agatha gasped, her breath ragged.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached under and obeyed immediately, lithe fingers finding Agatha’s clit and starting off by circling fast and wet and just right. </p><p> </p><p>It only took a minute. Less.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha came hard. Unexpectedly. Wailing into her own arm, and she felt herself clamping down on Rio’s cock, hard enough to make her stationary.</p><p> </p><p>She trembled as Rio’s hand at the small of her back began tracing incomprehensive, patternless shapes, accompanied by soft nips and the occasional drag of Rio’s tongue across her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Then:</p><p> </p><p>"Again?" Rio asked, voice low, husky.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit her bottom lip. Her knees buckled slightly at the thought, but she nodded.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes."</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate.</p><p> </p><p>The second time was sloppier, messier — Agatha practically sobbed through it, face pressed against her forearm, thighs shaking as Rio buried herself deep and didn’t let up. </p><p> </p><p>Her hips were practically a blur; slamming into Agatha’s ass, hitting a spot so deep in her stomach Agatha swore she saw white for a moment. Her cock was slick from a mixture of Rio’s spit and Agatha’s arousal and come from the first orgasm – it squelched and slapped obscenely with each thrust, far too loud for their current location, but neither of them cared at that point.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had never felt like this before. </p><p> </p><p>Not with Wanda. Not with any other woman. </p><p> </p><p>Like she wanted to crawl out of her own skin and into Rio’s, feel her from the inside out, take and take and take, allow Rio to just give and give and give.</p><p> </p><p>That thought terrified her. It turned her on. Made Agatha’s eyes roll back in pleasure; picturing what it’d be like to be so full of everything <em> Rio </em>until it was impossible to distinguish where Agatha began and Rio ended.</p><p> </p><p>By the third orgasm, Agatha’s mind began to unravel.</p><p> </p><p>Her moans grew quieter, reduced to whimpers and near-pathetic whines of ecstacy. </p><p> </p><p>A haze started to creep in. Not just from the pleasure, but the weight of everything else — Wanda’s sleepy face, the sound of her apology for falling asleep like it wasn’t the thousandth disappointment she’d handed over in a bow.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio’s hands. Her mouth. Her fucking voice whispering all those pet names in her ear like Agatha was some delicate, adored thing. Her cock filling Agatha’s cunt, over and over again, obediently following each word she spoke like Agatha were something to be worshipped.</p><p> </p><p>"Sweet girl." Rio murmured against her shoulder, still thrusting. "Such a good girl for me, aren’t you? So fucking <em> perfect </em>."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpered again, face buried into her arm.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t cry. Not now. </p><p> </p><p>Not while she was being fucked within an inch of her sanity.</p><p> </p><p>But the tears threatened all the same.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand had fallen to her tit again – rough as she squeezed it now, and Agatha basked in the feeling when Rio laid herself out, so her chest was flush with Agatha’s back.</p><p> </p><p>Her stamina was impressive, at this point.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hips continued their brutal pace; her cock was drenched now, and Agatha wouldn’t’ve been shocked if she woke up tomorrow and found that her cunt had moulded itself into the shape of the strap. It reached so deep inside her, made her thighs shake beautifully, and Agatha moaned as she pictured it breaching her stomach, pressing into the skin and forming a small bump that Rio could <em> definitely </em>press down on.</p><p> </p><p>“R-Rio… mfgh– clit– more…” Agatha gasped out, and she could feel a little spit pooling, dripping down her chin. “Want it… again…”</p><p> </p><p>“You can have it, baby.” Rio nodded, and she used the pads of her fingers to once again circle, tight and fast, and make Agatha’s entire body shake as she came a third time.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio– yes, yes, yes, fuck!” She screamed right into the sheets, her head lolled forward as all the strength to keep it up left her body with her orgasm.</p><p> </p><p>Tears streamed down freely now. Agatha’s cheeks were wet with the amalgamated warmth of flush and tears – she couldn’t control the cries leaving her body, the choking, desperate sobs muffled by the sheets.</p><p> </p><p>And still, Rio held her through it. A hand anchored at her left ass cheek, another intentionally continuing to rub her clit until it felt like a raw, exposed nerve.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio brought her to the edge again, a fourth threatening to slam right into her chest – crack through her ribs once again. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched for the wrong reasons.</p><p> </p><p>Now, it was too much.</p><p> </p><p>Too good.</p><p> </p><p>Too emotional.</p><p> </p><p>Too <em> fucking real. </em></p><p> </p><p>"Rio." She gasped, the whisper itself merely feeling like a scream.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve got you.” Rio breathed. “Come on, sweet girl, one more—”</p><p> </p><p>"No." She croaked, hips stuttering. "No, I—I <em> can’t </em>—"</p><p> </p><p>Rio slowed instantly. Froze. Moved her fingers away and stilled her hips, her cock still buried inside of her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha twisted, rolled away from her, practically crawling off the bed on trembling arms. Her legs gave out underneath her, knees hitting the cool sand as she slumped forward.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was off the cabana in a flash, crouched beside her.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, hey, are you okay?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached out, hesitated. </p><p> </p><p>"Baby, did I hurt you?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned to her, hair clinging to her damp cheek, breath ragged, voice raw. She shook her head frantically.</p><p> </p><p>“We… this can’t happen.” She whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“What—”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha choked on her own words as she tried to repeat them, still shaking from release, still clenching around nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“We… I– <em> this </em>needs to stop.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands stilled from where they’d settled at the sides of her neck. Agatha breathed out in a huff-like noise, and she built up the courage to look up, to actually look at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Upon seeing the sheer disdain on Rio’s face, Agatha wished she hadn’t turned around at all.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, why… what did I—”</p><p> </p><p>“We have to stop. I can’t… I can’t do this with you anymore, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>She scrambled back, reaching for her discarded suit, pulling them onto her body with shaky, uncoordinated hands. The top was far too loose, the bottoms were far too tight, but Agatha didn’t care. She looked away as the shame burned her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>She had to get out.</p><p> </p><p>Escape <em> it </em> now. Leave before <em> it </em> succeeded; before <em> it </em> could turn her ribs to tatters and squeeze Agatha’s heart in <em> its </em>palm.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just watched. Let her eyes follow every single motion, desperately searching for a sliver of eye contact again.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t go.”</p><p> </p><p>She was gone before Rio could even muster out a <em> ‘please’ </em>.</p>

<p>
<span>Agatha sipped her coffee in silence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’d been staring at the same croissant for nearly ten minutes, pulling it apart crumb by crumb.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The hotel’s rooftop terrace café was quiet that morning, save for the gentle clinking of cutlery against dishes and the occasional screech of a seagull.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda, sitting across from her, had launched into a detailed account of some dream she had last night, and Agatha gave the appropriate nods and hums.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wasn’t listening. Not really.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because every time Wanda’s voice rose in pitch, every time she gestured too enthusiastically, every time her fingers reached across the table and brushed Agatha’s hand? Agatha’s mind went elsewhere.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>To last night. To </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>To the way Rio had looked at her; soft, watchful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>To the heat of her skin, the press of her hips, the way she felt </span>
<em>
<span>inside of her.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>To the way Agatha had whispered ‘</span>
<em>
<span>Fuck me, now’ </span>
</em>
<span>and how Rio had obeyed like her word was gospel.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shifted in her seat now, thighs pressing together subtly. A fresh wave of guilt rippled through her gut just thinking about it. It was </span>
<em>
<span>suffocating </span>
</em>
<span>to picture it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re being quiet.” Wanda said suddenly, pulling Agatha back into the present.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hm?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda tilted her head. “You’ve barely said anything. What’s up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing.” Agatha replied, too quickly. Shit. “I’m just… tired.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Didn’t sleep well?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not really.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda reached for her mimosa and took a slow sip. Her eyes stayed on Agatha’s face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You sure everything’s okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated. “Yeah. Just a long few days.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ve been acting strange since the drag crawl.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s because you passed out on top of me halfway through sex.” Agatha blurted out before she could stop herself. She regretted it instantly, her eyes falling closed as she sighed from frustration; at herself, mostly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda scoffed, visibly bristling. “Jesus, Agatha. Can we not?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You asked.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It was an accident. I was drunk and tired—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure. Alright.” Agatha muttered, staring at her plate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Silence. Only for a moment, but it felt hours long.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you seriously trying to start a fight over this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not trying to start anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ve been distant to me for, like, days.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And </span>
<em>
<span>you’ve </span>
</em>
<span>been acting like everything’s perfect.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m trying to enjoy our vacation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So am I.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Could’ve fooled me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened. The croissant now lay entirely destroyed on her plate, reduced to a flaky wreckage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry I fell asleep.” Wanda said, her voice softening. “I was embarrassed afterward, alright? I didn’t mean to make you feel… unwanted.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda looked genuine. She always did when she said things like that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Apologetic. Contrite maybe. Like a woman desperate to make amends.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Agatha had heard that tone before. And the guilt was sitting in her throat, bubbling up like bile, burning her flesh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So, she did what she did best – Agatha deflected…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know for someone who’s cheated, you don’t seem to have much patience for the idea that I might still be hurting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>…And regretted it immediately.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda stared at her, taken aback.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck. Wait, fuck, shit.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wished she could take it back. Not for Wanda, not even for herself. She didn’t even want to bring it back up, and yet here she was, playing the role in her own self-sabotage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That was six months ago.” She said, voice tight. “I’ve done everything to prove I’m sorry. I’ve been patient, haven’t I? I’ve waited for you to come back to me emotionally—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I never left!” Agatha cut in. “I stayed. I forgave you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But you didn’t forget.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No.” Agatha admitted. “I didn’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda looked away, her jaw clenched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They sat in silence, the air between them thick.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was Agatha who finally spoke. “Sometimes I wonder if I just stayed because I didn’t want to start over.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda blinked at her. “Are you fucking </span>
<em>
<span>serious </span>
</em>
<span>right now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know.” Agatha whispered. “I’m just… thinking out loud.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then, as if conjured into some cruel, cosmic joke, a pair of familiar voices echoed across the terrace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“—told you they had rooftop seating.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jesus, it’s humid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha froze.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice and Rio. Of fucking course.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She could feel it before she even turned; the way her chest tightened, the way the blood in her ears roared suddenly like the rumble of a jet. Her heart thumped painfully once, then twice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda gave Agatha a once-over. Looked down at her plate, before plastering on that feigned smile of everything-is-fine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! Over here!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach plummeted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, perfect! Morning, lovebirds.” Alice beamed, gesturing over to their table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio said nothing. Agatha refused to look up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But she felt her. The shift in the air. That magnetic pull like gravity itself was recalibrating around Rio’s presence. She could smell her stupidly-nice cologne, faint and woodsy. Agatha swore she could feel the heat radiating off her skin even from a few steps away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Stupid fucking lesbian brain.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice plopped down in the seat beside Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mind if we join?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, of course not.” Wanda said brightly. “Please.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated a beat before sitting down across from Agatha — diagonal, not quite close enough to touch but too close nonetheless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes remained firmly on her coffee. She hoped, prayed even, that neither of them would talk to her directly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Fat chance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Woah, look at </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>thing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha only looked up when she noticed, in her peripheral vision, Alice wagging a finger toward her. She was grinning like a Cheshire, and Agatha’s brows furrowed in confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You two have fun last night, then?” Alice just laughed, reaching for her phone and opening up the camera, front-facing. “That’s a wicked bruise, Wanda. What are you, a vampire?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her own reflection.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Somehow, some-fucking-how, she’d missed the stark, blueish-red bruise sitting right along the side of her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She swallowed dryly, eyes flicking over to Wanda, then to Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Suddenly, Agatha was back; 18 hours ago, to Rio crowded over her back, pumping her cock in harder and harder, grunting right into Agatha’s ear, whispering through her–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Shit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh shit.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth on her neck. Rio’s teeth sinking into her skin. Rio’s tongue laving along in a stripe up her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wanted to scream. Stand up, flip the table over, fucking </span>
<em>
<span>strangle </span>
</em>
<span>Rio for being so careless and stupid.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At the same time, Agatha wanted to melt into her chair and let the relief flood her body; let the chaos ensue, let the secret finally escape, and let the crushing weight atop her chest be lifted into the air.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead, her gaze went right back to Wanda. Her fiancée. Who…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Didn’t seem perturbed at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She just laughed along with Alice, pretty rows of teeth gleaming as the phone was returned to the table, leaving Agatha to nervously reach up and brush her fingers along the mark.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can’t a girl appreciate her fiancée a little </span>
<em>
<span>too </span>
</em>
<span>much?” Wanda cheersed her glass to Alice’s empty one, before reaching over to pat Agatha’s hand that was resting on the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Oh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t even fucking remember any of last night. She thinks </span>
<em>
<span>she </span>
</em>
<span>did that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha cleared her throat, shifting in her seat. And if Alice or Wanda noticed Rio do the same, they didn’t say anything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, </span>
<em>
<span>we </span>
</em>
<span>just came from the beach. Took a sunrise walk. Nearly got attacked by a bird the size of a toddler.” Alice explained as she stretched out her arms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda laughed. “This island is crawling with seagulls.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gulls don’t usually look like they’ve been hitting the gym.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What about you two?” She asked, glancing between Agatha and Wanda. “You been off exploring the last couple days?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda launched into it immediately. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes! Yesterday we did this whole mythology walking tour, and before that, the Acropolis. Agatha even tried to recreate a statue pose.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice gasped. “Which one?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Venus de Milo. But sassier.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha forced a laugh, hollow and unconvincing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She could feel Rio’s gaze like a weight pressing against her cheek.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then, we did a bar crawl across Athens. The clubs are so beautiful here!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Don’t look at her. Don’t look at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This one drag queen, she was, like, seven feet tall. And she complimented my hair! Said she would’ve paid three hundred for a wig that looked like my hair. I nearly cried, I swear.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But she could see Rio in her peripheral. The rolled sleeves. The tan lines. The way her hand curled around her glass. The faintest smudge of sunscreen near her jaw.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m gonna head to the bathroom.” Agatha said suddenly, pushing back from her chair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We just sat down.” Wanda frowned, though there wasn’t </span>
<em>
<span>much </span>
</em>
<span>protest in her voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll be quick.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t wait for a reply. She walked away. Fast.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her sandals slapped against the stone steps as she descended back into the lobby, heart pounding, mouth dry. Agatha didn’t make it to the bathroom. Instead, she stepped out onto a shaded back patio encased in three glass walls and a railing facing the sea. Agatha sucked in a deep breath like she’d been underwater too long.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Stupid. It’s so fucking stupid to run.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But she couldn’t breathe up there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sliding glass door slid open loudly behind her. Agatha didn’t dare to turn around.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t follow you.” Rio said gently. “I just… happened to need air.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “Of course you did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A pause.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded slowly. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to her, arms folding tight across her chest. “We can’t keep doing this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded again, and got that look; the same from last night. Like a kicked puppy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You can’t keep looking at me like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wasn’t—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, you were.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stepped forward, slowly. “</span>
<em>
<span>You</span>
</em>
<span> haven’t even looked at </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span> since I fucking sat down, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t.” Agatha snapped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Because I’d fucking… I’d melt, I’d fucking melt, </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span>. Because I’d start thinking about your mouth and your hands and what we did last night and—” She cut herself off, voice cracking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was still. Just watching her, cautious, as though Agatha were a stray kitten she wanted to save. Maybe they were in this scenario. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha certainly felt like yowling; sinking her nails into something, scratching until it’s raw and bleeding, just to distract herself.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t be this person.” Agatha whispered. “I’m with someone else. I promised to spend the rest of my life with her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw clenched, but she didn’t argue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I said I forgave her. I chose her. I can’t… I can’t be </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So what,” Rio said softly, “this means nothing then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha flinched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Because it doesn’t feel like nothing. Maybe that’s what you wanted– shit, I thought I wanted that too. But–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It has to be.” Agatha choked out. “It has to be nothing. Otherwise I’m a goddamn hypocrite.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled. Her eyes dropped to the ground.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I get it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, you don’t—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I do.” Rio said, voice firmer now. “You’re scared. You’re guilty. And you’re confused. And I stupidly let myself get dragged into this… storm, or whatever, that’s going on in your life.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard. Her arms hugged tighter around herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was so close now, only two steps away from where she could easily slip those hands around Agatha’s waist like she’d done countless times in the past week. Agatha could smell that lingering, woodsy cologne on Rio’s neck; it filled her lungs like water, and Agatha chastised herself internally for wanting to drown in it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re not happy, Agatha. And you haven’t been for a long time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, hard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then, Rio’s hand outstretched, and Agatha nearly crumbled into pieces as the soft, warm skin of Rio’s palm cradled her face, keeping her jaw upright.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let me go, Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Another hand, slinking around the curve of her hip; digits curling around the flesh and holding her body together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This… we’re– I’ve known you for seven days, this isn’t–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ve known her for years.” Rio cut in, and Agatha couldn’t bring herself to step away, even as their noses brushed. “The woman you love. You dedicated months and months of your life, of your time, of your love, to her. Agreed to a life with her, to share everything with her, to live in the same space for the rest of your days – and yet the moment </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>touch you, you look at me like </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>was the one who asked it all of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught. They were so close. So goddamn close. </span>
<em>
<span>Merely anchored by a hand on her hip; their stomachs and chests nearly touching; it would be so easy to just–</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And if I’d asked that of you?” Rio tilted her head ever so slightly. “Would you have said yes, and actually </span>
<em>
<span>meant it</span>
</em>
<span> this time?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Silence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Thick, weighted, tense silence. Not even the wisps of the breeze rushing by could be heard by either of them. Nor the distant cries of a gull, the lapping of waves along the shore, the chatter of hotel guests a floor below.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Would you, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The words came out like a rush of air, ghosting over Agatha’s mouth with how close they’d grown.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her eyes burned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her chest seized.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her palms itched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was only one thought in her mind now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Yes.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stepped back, and the touch ceased.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her hand slipped from both Agatha’s hip and her face, returning to her sides as she took a few steps back, creating an agonising distance between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m gonna give you the space you want.” Rio stated, pausing to clear her throat. “But when you’re ready to answer my question? yYou know where to find me, angel.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha watched. Her eyes never left Rio, following her as she turned and walked away, slipping past the door and out of view.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her legs felt unsteady as she reached out to grip ahold of the railing, and her chest shook as the tears began to fall.</span>

<p align="center">
<b>Eight Months Ago</b>
</p><p> </p><p>The subway ride was hell.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slumped in her scratchy, worn seat, closed sketchbook balanced against her knees, and a pencil resting uselessly between her fingers. </p><p> </p><p>Her head was still ringing with the condescending voice of her boss, Arthur; that nasal whine she hated more than anything.</p><p> </p><p><em> ‘We’ll have to rotate your pieces out, Agatha. It’s only temporary, of course — it’s just that this new artist’s collection is drawing more attention. It’s business, you understand. </em>’</p><p> </p><p>Business. That was his lame-ass excuse. </p><p> </p><p>Her canvases, the ones she’d spent months pouring her soul into, replaced with gaudy abstracts from some rich kid who knew the right people. She wouldn’t sell a single piece this week. Which meant no money. Which meant rent stress again. Which meant maybe pawning something, or leaning on Wanda to pick up groceries. Again.</p><p> </p><p>Her chest tightened.</p><p> </p><p>She tapped her phone awake. Four unread messages from clients — two of them cancelling their commissions, one asking for a refund. None from Wanda.</p><p> </p><p>She scrolled back through the thread. Her texts from earlier that afternoon sat there, unanswered.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha: Hey babe, thinking of you. How’s your day going? [11:03am] </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha: Arthur is being a dick. Drinks later? Think we have some wine left from our last dinner party with Darcy and co. [2:45pm] </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha: Wanna order Thai tonight? I’m craving pad see ew. [6:49pm] </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hours old. Still marked delivered. No reply.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried not to think too hard about it. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda worked long hours. She was always busy with her classes, her research, her projects. It wasn’t unusual, but it still gnawed at her.</p><p> </p><p>The subway rattled into her stop. She shoved her sketchbook into her oversized gallery-branded tote, slipped her phone into her pocket, and stood. Her reflection in the scratched-up window of the train looked tired. The makeup she’d applied that morning had smudged; her eyeliner sat heavy under her eyes, her lipstick faded to a faint, careless stain.</p><p> </p><p>She hated looking like this when she got home. Wanda always looked so damn put together, even after work — in one of those neat blouses, skirt sitting perfect above her knees, hair pinned up in a bun that somehow kept it's shape the entire day. Meanwhile, Agatha always walked in like she’d walked through a hurricane.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Ugh. Whatever.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The stairwell up to the street smelled like piss and rain. Thunder rolled somewhere in the distance, and Agatha tugged her jacket tighter around her frame, hurrying the few blocks up to their building.</p><p> </p><p>By the time she reached the front entrance, her hair clung to her forehead in damp curls. She pushed inside, nodding to their doorman out of habt, and groaned as she passed by the still-broken elevator to trudge her way up five flights of stairs.</p><p> </p><p>The hallway outside their apartment was dim. She pulled her keys from her bag, hesitating when she slid the first one into the lock.</p><p> </p><p>She heard a noise.</p><p> </p><p>Low and rhythmic, and muffled too, coming from the other side of the door.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped dead in her tracks.</p><p> </p><p>It was faint, but unmistakable. A weird, wet sound, a hitch of breath, and a familiar-sounding whimper.</p><p> </p><p>Her chest went hollow.</p><p> </p><p>Slowly, she turned the key and eased the door open an inch.</p><p> </p><p>The first thing she saw was Wanda’s bare legs dangling over the couch arm. Pale, smooth, trembling with every motion.</p><p> </p><p>The second thing was the dark crown of red hair between them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda was sprawled out on the sofa, the only thing covering her being that of a lace-cupped bra, her head thrown back against the cushions and those lips parted around loud, desperate moans. Her back bowed against the sofa, hips rocking against the tongue buried between her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>Natasha.</p><p> </p><p>Of course it was <em> fucking </em>Natasha. That smug trainer from the gym who was always hanging around Wanda whenever Agatha swung by to take the subway home with her girlfriend. Muscles and sexy smirks, all soft touches on Wanda’s waist during stretches, all too-long hugs when her class ended.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had noticed it months ago. She’d said something, but Wanda had laughed it off. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘You’re jealous over nothing, babe. Don’t be silly, you have nothing to worry about.’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>And here she was. Getting eaten out in their living room like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t move an inch, no matter how hard she tried. Her keys stayed clenched in her fist, the too-big tote sliding slowly off her shoulder until it hit the floor with a dull thud. Neither woman heard it as Wanda’s cries filled the apartment, louder now. One might even say unrestrained.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes— fuck, Nat— right there... <em>oh my God </em>—"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat burned. </p><p> </p><p>She wanted to scream. She wanted to vomit. She wanted to walk in there and drag that <em> motherfucker </em>out by her hair. Instead, she stayed rooted to the spot, watching like a ghost in her own damned apartment. Her pulse pounded in her ears. She hated herself for how transfixed she was. For how she kept staring at Wanda’s body, slick and flushed and unfairly beautiful, even in betrayal.</p><p> </p><p>She watched Wanda shudder, watched her thighs clamp tight around Natasha’s head, watched her toes curl in pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>Her girlfriend came hard. <strong>Loud</strong>. Crying out Natasha’s name.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped out from under her. For a second, it felt like the whole world had stopped around her.</p><p> </p><p>And then Natasha pulled back, wiping the glistening slick from her mouth with the back of her hand.  That was when her eyes flicked up and landed on Agatha in the doorway. She froze, causing Wanda to follow her gaze. Her head jerked up as those wide, green eyes met Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>Hell broke loose.</p><p> </p><p>"Baby—" Wanda’s voice cracked, panic surging instantly. </p><p> </p><p>She scrambled upright, yanking a throw blanket over her body, stumbling across the room like she could somehow undo what had just happened. Tears spilled over her cheeks before she even reached her.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh my God! Aggie, I can explain, please, it’s not— fuck, it’s not what it looks like—"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest seized. Words stuck in her throat like glass.</p><p> </p><p>Natasha stood there awkwardly, shirt half-unbuttoned, sweat shining on her neck. Her smugness had evaporated, replaced with something like guilt. But she didn’t move to cover herself. She just… looked.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda grabbed Agatha’s arm, clutching at her desperately. "Sweetheart, please. Please, listen to me—"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha jerked away. Her voice wouldn’t come out; nothing came out. For someone pretty outspoken, pretty <em>loud</em> when she wants to be, Agatha felt unnerved by the way she’d been struck speechless.</p><p> </p><p>The air was too thick, the apartment too small, Wanda’s wracking sobs too loud. Agatha turned and walked out, not having said a word the entire time. The hallway blurred around her as she pushed through the stairwell doors, stumbling down flight after flight until she hit the lobby. Their doorman looked up, a little startled, but Agatha didn’t stop.</p><p> </p><p>Outside, the city skyline had split open. Rain hammered down in buckets, soaking her hair and clothes in seconds.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha staggered into the downpour, her chest still heaving and her throat tight, like a fist had wrapped around it and refused to loosen up.</p><p> </p><p>Her phone buzzed in her pocket. She didn’t look; she knew it was Wanda.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just walked faster. The rain hid her tears, but she knew they were there. Burning her already-steaming cheeks, blending with the rainwater until neither were distinguishable from one another.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to scream into the storm. She wanted to drag that <em> fire-hydrant-ass-motherfucker </em>back out and tear her apart in front of Wanda. She wanted to stop fucking hurting.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she shoved her hands into her pockets and let the darkness of the city swallow her whole.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚢</p><p> </p><p>Agatha woke to the feel of her own tears drying against her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>The hotel room was darker than before, sunlight spilling through the half-drawn curtains across the bedspread in long, broken lines. Her head throbbed dully, and her throat was raw and scratchy, like claws had dragged desperately along her flesh. She must have cried herself into unconsciousness the moment she’d stumbled back here.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fucking pathetic. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her face was buried in the pillow, damp with the evidence of her breakdown. She inhaled once, the scent of the hotel’s harsh detergent catching sharp in her nose, and groaned. </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, stiffly, Agatha pushed herself upright. Her body felt heavy, as though every emotion she’d tried and failed to contain earlier had settled into her limbs like lead.</p><p> </p><p>The silence pressed on her ears. She swung her legs over the side of the bed, toes brushing against the cold marble floor. </p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Agatha just sat there, elbows braced against her knees, head in her hands. The weight of the day clawed at her chest; the lingering lust, amalgamated with the guilt, anger, longing – all colliding in a mess so tangled she didn’t know where one ended and another began.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, she forced herself up. Her legs carried her on autopilot across the room, past hers and her fiancee's luggage, past the vanity with a half-drunk glass of wine, to the sliding balcony door.</p><p> </p><p>The air hit her the moment she stepped out. Warm, salt-heavy, threaded with the faint perfume of hibiscus from the hotel gardens below. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled a pack of cigarettes from the pocket of her discarded jacket, shook one loose with trembling fingers, and brought it to her lips. She lit it up and dragged the smoke deep into her lungs, holding it there until her chest burned, then exhaled slowly, watching the tendrils curl and vanish up into the air.</p><p> </p><p>She braced her forearms on the balcony railing, staring out at the glittering expanse of ocean. The smoke did nothing to calm the storm inside her, but at least it gave her something to do with her hands, something to momentarily fill the silence.</p><p> </p><p>Her mind betrayed her with another memory.</p><p> </p><p>Natasha.</p><p> </p><p>The nerve of that fucking woman.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha remembered the day too clearly. Coming into the gallery, still hollowed out from nights of sleepless rage on her godmother’s couch, only to find Natasha waiting by the front desk. Leaning against the wall in tight jeans and a leather jacket, all smug apology and crocodile eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>I just want to talk.</em>" She’d said, voice low and casual, like she wasn’t the reason Agatha’s relationship had crumbled into dust.</p><p> </p><p><em> The </em> <b> <em>fucking </em> </b> <em> nerve. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t answered. She’d walked straight past her, jaw clenched, heart hammering, only to hear Natasha follow, footsteps echoing through the gallery.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>You deserve an explanation.</em>"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had spun on her heel so fast Natasha almost collided with her. The whole lobby had gone silent. Agatha’s fist had been faster than her words. The crack of knuckle against cheekbone rang out like a gunshot.</p><p> </p><p>The sting had travelled up her left arm. The satisfaction had lasted all of three seconds. </p><p> </p><p>Then she was left staring at the marring of red across her hand; Natasha clutching her face with a shocked laugh; and the gallery staff frozen behind the desk. God knows how Agatha had managed to <em> keep </em>her job after it all.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had turned and walked out before she did something worse. She’d ended the night nursing her bruised knuckles with whiskey, unable to stop shaking on the same couch she’d slept on, and stayed there for the next two days.</p><p> </p><p>Presently, she ground the cigarette out on the railing now, tossing the butt into the ashtray by her chair. </p><p> </p><p>Another lit almost instantly after. The smoke filled her lungs again, and she pressed her lips tight, fighting against the swell of everything inside her.</p><p> </p><p>Then? A sound caught her ear. Only-slightly muffled voices.</p><p> </p><p>She froze, head snapping toward the adjoining balcony. The door there was cracked open, faint lamplight spilling through, and the voices were unmistakable now.</p><p> </p><p>Alice. And Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stilled completely, her chest going tight, her body leaning instinctively closer to the wall that separated their balconies. She didn’t mean to eavesdrop. But the tone; sharp, clipped, and so unlike Alice’s typical jokey self; kept her in place.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you think I’m <em> stupid</em>, Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>“Alice, would you please just listen–”</p><p> </p><p>“I saw you. This morning, I was coming back here to grab my bag, and I <em> saw </em>you. You and Agatha on that patio!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s blood ran cold as Alice’s voice continued, relentless. </p><p> </p><p>“Her face was tipped up at you like she was about to— hell, like she was<em> in love </em> with you. Your hand was on her hip, your face was right there– Rio, your fucking noses were touching. And you mean to tell me that was <em> innocent?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Silence followed. Heavy.</p><p> </p><p>Alice knew. <em> How long had she known? Was she aware of it this entire time? Fuck, fucking fuckfuckfuck– </em></p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally answered, her voice was lower, defensive, tight with a frustration Agatha knew too well. </p><p> </p><p>“I cut it off, Alice. I did. That’s done. It’s over.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really?” Alice’s voice dripped with disbelief. “Because the way you were looking at her… you expect me to believe you’re not still tangled up in her?”</p><p> </p><p>“I said I cut it off.” Rio snapped, louder now. “What the fuck else do you want me to say?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest twisted against her will. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Cut it off. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Alice’s tone softened, but only slightly. “I want you to be honest. With me, with yourself. Because right now? You’re being reckless. You’re playing with fire. And you’re 100 percent going to get burned — <em> both </em>of you will. Not to mention what you’re doing to Wanda?! That poor girl worships her!”</p><p> </p><p>There was a pause. Then Rio’s voice broke through, fierce, raw, almost desperate.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you think I don’t know that? Do you think I don’t know how fucking stupid I am for wanting her? For even looking at her like that? Christ, Alice, I’ve been trying to rip her out of my head since the second it started, and I can’t. I can’t fucking stop.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kept going, words spilling like a dam had cracked.</p><p> </p><p>“She drives me insane. The way she looks at me. like she’s already undressing me before she even blinks. The way she bites her lip when she’s thinking. That fuckin’ mouth of hers, the things she says— God, Alice, she’s the filthiest person I’ve ever met and I swear I’d let her ruin me with her words alone. The way she laughs, it-it’s sharp, it cuts, but it makes me feel like I’d bleed for it anyway. She orders me around like she knows I’ll obey, and fuck, she’s right. I’d do anything she told me to. Anything. And don’t even get me started on her body—”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio—” Alice tried to cut in, but Rio barrelled on.</p><p> </p><p>“—no I’m serious. Al, the way she fits against me, the taste of her skin— <em> fuck </em>, I swear I could spend the rest of my life with my face buried between her thighs and it still wouldn’t be enough. I can’t stop thinking about her. I don’t even want to stop. She’s all I’ve thought about this whole vacation. Every second of it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s entire body shivered.</p><p> </p><p>Alice sighed, long, weary. “And that’s exactly the problem. You’re <strong>not</strong> thinking straight. She’s engaged. To Wanda. You’re setting yourself up for heartbreak, Rio. And worse? You’re setting her up for it too. This can’t end well, and you know it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know.” Rio admitted, softer now, voice fraying at the edges. Agatha thought she could hear fabric shifting, like one of them had taken a seat on the bed. </p><p> </p><p>“I know. But knowing doesn’t stop me wanting her. And I did the right thing. I did. I’m trying, Alice.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice didn’t answer right away. Then: “I know you did. I love you, Ri, but you… you need to <em>try harder</em> before you destroy yourself. And her relationship. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>The silence that followed was crushing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s cigarette had burned to its filter between her fingers. She hadn’t moved, hadn’t breathed, afraid any sound might give her away. Her pulse thrummed wildly in her throat and her chest. She likely would’ve stayed there for hours, were it not for the soft click of a door opening behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha spun around, to find Wanda stood in the doorway of their hotel room. Her hair was a little mussed, her face pale, and her expression was a little tight and certainly unreadable.</p><p> </p><p>The voices next door fell silent now. They’d heard the door open too, of course.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped back inside as Wanda closed the front door behind her. Her eyes locked onto Agatha’s, and they were unflinching, heavy with something that made Agatha’s stomach churn.</p><p> </p><p>“We need to talk.”</p>
