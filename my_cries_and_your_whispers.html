<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>On a random, depressing day. In a bar the brokenhearted professor Rio Vidal knows all too well, she sees a woman. Or as she describes her in her head, <em>an ethereal being<em>, the painter Agatha Harkness—a woman whose mere presence sobered Rio up, then made her drunk again for an entirely different reason.</em></em></p><p>
<em>
<em>Can Rio—a woman who doubts her self-worth, who believes she's undeserving of love—handle holding the door open for someone as delicate and willing as Agatha?<br/>And if she does, can she handle letting her in afterward?</em>
<br/>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p align="left">Rain heavily poured down on her as she sat in her garden, surrounded by the plants she put so much effort into growing so they could soothe her. To reconnect with her own self. To be held by nature's embrace.</p><p align="left">As the rain continued to fall down on her head and soaking her wet. Feeling the water cleansing her whole being, her mind wouldn't rest. Her thoughts were consumed by the woman who left her broken and completely out of control of herself.</p><p align="left">Tears steamed her face and mixed with the raindrops. Her head was filled with only her—that woman. Her ex–girlfriend.</p><p align="left">Four months ago, Rio Vidal's world completely shattered after that breakup. It weakened her.</p><p align="left">The last words her ex–girlfriend said still felt like daggers in Rio's body. They made her bleed and weep. </p><p align="left">“<em>I look at you and I see nothing, Rio. I see nobody but a stranger I once knew. I don't even know how I loved you in the first place, you're a monster Rio Vidal.</em>” </p><p align="left">“I'm the monster? You really want to have this conversation with me right now, Jane? I fucking caught you cheating on me with a dude for fuck's sake! On our goddamn bed! While I was gone, planning a vacation for your majesty so we could celebrate our fourth anniversary! But you obviously had better plans in your head.” Rio said as she looked at her girlfriend who refused to meet her eyes. </p><p align="left">“I don't love you Rio, I'm sorry but I just don't.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah don't worry. I figured that out when I saw a dick deep inside you.” Rio's voice dropped lower as she walked toward the couch. Throwing all of her weight as she sat down with a heavy sigh. Feeling herself getting consumed by the piece of furniture. </p><p align="left">Rio stretched her arm toward the coffee table and grabbed the bottle of vodka.</p><p align="left">“I'm leaving.” Her girlfriend said once Rio took the first gulp.</p><p align="left">“You better do.” Rio whispered as she stared at the black screen of the turned-off TV as she clenched the bottle tighter. She didn't want to look at her girlfriend's defrauding green eyes.</p><p align="left">As Jane walked toward the door with force, the sound of her heels clicking on the floor with every step she took. “I had no regrets 'til I met you, Rio.” she said and stepped out. Slamming the door shut behind her.</p><p align="left">Rio never understood how her ex girlfriend managed to play the victim's role in a situation like that. Or how she manipulated her into believing that <em>she</em> was the bad person. The monster who never deserved love or happiness.</p><p align="left">How did she manag to get into her head and fuck with her life over and over again? And why did she allow it? How was she so naïve, standing in the corner and looking at herself from an outsid instead of stepping in to rescue herself? </p><p align="left">Until it was too late.</p><p align="left">Her life felt hollow. Empty of any meaning or purpose. Rio felt like nothing could save her anymore. She should just rot and everything could burn in hell.</p><p align="left">She had experienced breakups before, but none came close to this miserable one.</p><p align="left">Her depression wasn't merely a result of her ex's constant manipulation. How she cheated on her and lied to her for years.</p><p align="left">It stemmed from how disgusted Rio was with herself. </p><hr/><p align="left">The sunlight woke her up instead of the alarm.</p><p align="left">Rio had left the windows open last night while she was gazing at the clouded moon. Thinking about taking her own life while drinking like a maniac.</p><p align="left">But for some reason, she couldn't do it. </p><p align="left">The night breeze was cold and it brushed with her hair tenderly. The moon looked alluring. Its light escaped through the grey clouds and illuminated the night. The clouds sailed in the sky and there were a few shining stars, blinking constantly. The neighborhood looked different at night, it was <em>peaceful</em>. She observed and noticed it all, even with her blurry vision. She saw the cats moving, heard the wind whispering and the night humming.</p><p align="left">And that gave Rio something else other than how miserable she was to think about.</p><p align="left">Maybe another night, when the sky wouldn't be so beautiful. </p><p align="left">Her headache was unbearable. Rio was able to feel every goddamn nerve pulsating in her head. It felt like a warning, that her head would explode at any second.</p><p align="left">Rio cursed herself as she removed the duvet away from her body and forced herself to sit down. The moment she put her feet on the floor, the alarm went off and it was so loud. She felt it in her stomach instead of her ears, and it was nauseating.</p><p align="left">She walked toward the bathroom with heavy, languid. Dragging her legs forward that she felt they were moving on their own.</p><p align="left">Rio grabbed the bathroom's door for dear life when she felt the nauseous sensations burning in her stomach.</p><p align="left">She put her hand on her mouth as she hurried her steps until her head was leaning down to the toilet seat and her body fell down on the cold floor of the dark bathroom, she didn't even bother turning the lights on.</p><p align="left">Rio immediately started vomited her soul out. Her mouth and stomach were burning. The taste was making her sicker than she already was. Her head stayed leaning down as she felt the tension in her neck and shoulders because she couldn't sleep well last night. Her hair was falling down by her sides and its length was annoying, adding to all the shit she was experiencing. Rio needed to cut it from its roots.</p><p align="left">She felt disgusted with herself. It was unbearable.</p><p align="left">But the coldness of the bathroom's floor offered a sense of... safety and belonging. As if she belonged there, sitting on the floor while vomiting her feelings out of her body with her eyes closed shut.</p><p align="left">After a few minutes, Rio spat down then she managed to stand on her feet again while wiping her mouth with her sleeve.</p><p align="left">She washed her face multiple times then she lifted her water-dripping head and stared at her reflection—she looked like hell.</p><p align="left">Rio had been looking like hell for months now. She had lost so much weight, and whatever she was feeling, it appeared on the outside, whether she wanted or not.</p><p align="left">The darkness that circled her eyes had become a part of her face. The pale, damaged skin and the chapped, dry lips. The messy, split hair. Misery was written all over her face.</p><p align="left">She stared for a few more seconds, then Rio turned her face away, unable to handle her own reflection any longer. Who was she staring at? Who the hell was that?</p><p align="left">She hopped into the shower after taking every piece of fabric off her body. The warm water cascaded down her whole being, feeling her body getting cleaned while her mind drowned in thoughts Rio couldn't contain. She didn't know how to do that. She didn't have the right container.</p><p align="left">Rio stepped out and wrapped a towel around her body without actually drying. She walked the hallway to her bedroom as her body and hair dropped down on the floor.</p><p align="left">She approached the wardrobe and pulled out the first thing her eyes landed on—some black trousers a white button–up shirt and she grabbed her usual jacket from the chair, that black jacket that she didn't wash in a week and a few days.</p><p align="left">Rio got into her car and drove to the nearest café to the university as she listened to her thoughts during the ride. Blending with the annoying sounds of the streets, people and the morning.</p><p align="left">After grabbing her black coffee she made her way to the office, she wasn't ready for any of this.</p><p align="left">“Hey, nice seeing you here, stranger. Where have you been?”</p><p align="left">“I was literally here yesterday, Alice.”</p><p align="left">“No, I mean where have you been, Rio? You either at home or here. You don't even go out anymore. It has been months.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, I've been busy.” Rio said as she unlocked the door, pushed it open and stepped inside.</p><p align="left">“Busy mourning an asshole?” Alice asked as she followed Rio inside.</p><p align="left">Rio turned around and looked at her with sharp eyes.</p><p align="left">She knew her ex was an asshole but she didn't want to hear it, she couldn't bear hearing such a fact. She didn't want a reminder. </p><p align="left">The only asshole Rio was mourning every morning was herself.</p><p align="left">“Sorry. But seriously, Rio, you should go out. You'd get yourself killed like that.”</p><p align="left">“Out where, Alice? Bars? Clubs? Drinking all night as I try to pour my sadness and suffering into any girl's mouth that would be willing to swallow?” Her voice rose as she heavily placed her things on the desk.</p><p align="left">“I didn't mean that.” Alice sat on the green velvet couch, looking at Rio.</p><p align="left">Rio ran a hand through her hair then she opened a bottle of water and started watering her plant. She needed to do something with her hands otherwise she'd explode. </p><p align="left">She looked back at Alice and her heart tightened in her chest as she firmly closed the bottle. She didn't like the sympathetic look in her best friend's eyes. It weakened her.</p><p align="left">“Don't you have lectures to attend, professor?” Rio said as she sat down on the chair. Trying to change the subject so she wouldn't be the center of it.</p><p align="left">“No, I'm staying here.”</p><p align="left">“Well, I have lectures to attend. So I have to go.”</p><p align="left">“Do you want to grab a drink later? Just talking, catching up. You know?”</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her, holding back.</p><p align="left">She wanted to go out—see people, and talk. But she also didn't want to. What good would that do to her? To talk and force someone to hear her problems? People have enough pain already. They're dealing with their own struggles everyday, then why bother them with more?</p><p align="left">“Just the drink without the talking part.” Rio said after a while. Breaking the uncomfortable silence that was about to stretch.</p><p align="left">“You'll talk eventually.” Alice softly smiled as she stood up. </p><p align="left">She exited and closed the door behind her after telling Rio to take care of herself.</p><p align="left">Rio let out a deep, heavy sigh as she leaned back on her chair. Feeling the tension in her muscles and her headache was worsening with every passing second. She leaned forward and grabbed her coffee that she knew won't help her in any way. But she needed it so she wouldn't crash out.</p><p align="left">She managed to survive the day and <em>herself</em>. Aside from how hard her work could be. How challenging it was at times, Rio found some kind of comfort in teaching. It distracted her from herself. Looking at the faces of the youth as she explained to them, it made her feel good even if it was temporary and it faded the moment the lecture reached its end.</p><p align="left">Rio stepped out of her office, exited campus and headed to the parking lot while fisting the car key in her hand. </p><p align="left">“Hey, Vidal!” Alice called her from behind.</p><p align="left">Rio inhaled deeply before she turned around to face her. “Hey, what's up?”</p><p align="left">“Still up for the drinks, right?”</p><p align="left">“You say that like I have a say in this.” Rio chuckled.</p><p align="left">“Exactly, you don't.” Alice said, her voice was laced with amusement.</p><p align="left">“God Alice, you're insufferable.”</p><p align="left">“I know. Anyway, going somewhere?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, home.”</p><p align="left">“Great, so I'll meet you there or should I come and pick you up?”</p><p align="left">“No, just text me the address and I'll be there.”</p><p align="left">“Alright. Don't you dare bail on me though.”</p><p align="left">“I wish I could do that, Alice.” </p><p align="left">Alice chuckled as she put her hands in her pockets. “By the way,” She paused to search Rio's face. “Jen will be there, if that's okay.”</p><p align="left">Rio met Alice's uncertain eyes as she took a few seconds to think. Then she smiled, an honest smile that reached all the way up to her tired eyes.</p><p align="left">“Yes, of course. It's about time I meet her properly.”</p><p align="left">Once Rio got into her car, she took a deep breath, started the engine and headed to her depressing home.</p><p align="left">She opened the front door and stepped inside. Rio took her shoes off by the door and walked to nestle into the couch, letting the heavy silence of her house consum.</p><p align="left">She closed her eyes for a while, as her head visually replayed many unpleasant memories. Heavy, awful things that happened right in this living room. Tears threatened to fall down but Rio refused to listen to them, she didn't want to obey. So she opened her eyes and her eyelids were heavier than a rock.</p><p align="left">Rio laggardly dragged her feet toward the kitchen. She grabbed a bottle of beer and drank it as she got upstairs, heading to the mess that was called her bedroom. </p><p align="left">She took her clothes off and put on an oversized t–shirt.</p><p align="left">She gluped her beer down until the bottle was empty. Rio set it on the nightstand and crashed onto her bed. </p><hr/><p align="left">A couple of hours later, Rio woke up sweating and her breaths were heavy. She couldn't do anything other than stare at the ceiling, tracing its patterns while listening to the buzzing of her phone blending with her heavy gasps.</p><p align="left">Rio closed her eyes as she put one of her hand on her chest, right above her heart and the other rested on her stomach.</p><p align="left">She tried calming her alerted body down. Trying and failing to remind herself that there was no reason to panic.</p><p align="left">She started counting inside her head as she desperately tried organizing her breaths. </p><p align="left">Rio weakly bent her legs up as she listened to her heartbeats ringing inside her ears. She closed her eyes as she slid her hand underneath her shirt and started palming her chest to calm her heart down, until she was finally able to feel herself getting back <em>inside</em>.</p><p align="left">After a couple of seconds, Rio sat straight. Her back leaning against the headboard as she grabbed her phone, cleared her throat and swiped to answer.</p><p align="left">“Hello?”</p><p align="left">“Dude are you sleeping?”</p><p align="left">“Not anymore.”</p><p align="left">“Good. Okay, can you meet us in an hour?”</p><p align="left">“You could've texted me, Alice.”</p><p align="left">“I did, Rio. You weren't responding.”</p><p align="left">Rio sighed. “Sorry, I crashed out. I didn't sleep...” She pressed two fingers on her eyes, desperately trying to ease the headache away only for a few seconds. “Anyway, meet you an hour, yeah?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, take care.”</p><p align="left">Rio hung up as she threw her phone on the bed and her body slid down to lay on her back again. </p><p align="left">She stared at the ceiling while regretting her entire life. “Death is not coming to me anytime soon,”</p><p align="left">Rio got up as she grabbed the bottle of beer from the night stand. She lifted it up to her mouth and realized it was empty and only a few drops fell down into her mouth.</p><p align="left">She sighed as she set it back on its place.</p><p align="left">She washed her face as she ignored her own reflection in the mirror. She wasn't in the mood to deal with herself.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her wardrobe, considering the options. But she wasn't really looking, her head was blank in a terrifying way and her eyes were only drifting left and right.</p><p align="left">She settled on black trousers and a navy-blue button–up shirt, not wanting to over think any of it. She was going to drink all night until she black out, which was what she had been doing for a long time lately, but the difference was she'd do it with someone else.</p><p align="left">Rio forced herself to look at her reflection just so she could apply her eyeliner and lipstick and didn't glance any longer. Although she caught that empty look in her eyes.</p><p align="left">She grabbed her bag and keys then stepped out. The night breeze embraced her, causing a shiver to run down her spine.</p><p align="left">Rio took a deep breath as she closed her eyes. She felt utterly <em>present</em> in that moment as the strange sensation took over her. Creeping inside.</p><p align="left">She parked her car and got out of it, heading to the usual bar—the one that she knew all too well.</p><p align="left">“Here we are.” Rio muttered to herself while stepping inside, searching for Alice with her eyes in the booth she knew Alice would be sitting in.</p><p align="left">“Here, Rio!” Alice shouted from the back of the bar, waving with her hand so Rio could notice her.</p><p align="left">Rio walked toward forward and sat facing her friend.</p><p align="left">“Rio this is Jennifer. Jen this is Rio.”</p><p align="left">The two women looked at each other at the same time, exchanging polite smiles.</p><p align="left">“Nice to finally meet you.” Jen said as she offered her hand for Rio to shake.</p><p align="left">“Nice to meet you, Jennifer.” Rio gladly took her hand.</p><p align="left">“I can't believe this is the first time you guys meet each other.” Alice said as she clapped her hands together. “Why is that?” She looked at Rio, knowing the exact answer to her question.</p><p align="left">“Wrap it up, Alice.” Rio chuckled.</p><p align="left">“This is your fault.” Her friend said with a chuckle as she stood up. “Alright, I'm going to grab us some drinks. Anything in particular?”</p><p align="left">“No, the usual, Ali. Thank you.”٠ Rio said as she searched the bar with her eyes for no reason—or probably there was a reason and it was too embarrassing to admit it even to herself.</p><p align="left">“Looking for someone?” Jen asked once Alice was out of sight.</p><p align="left">“No, not really.” Rio responded as she met her eyes.</p><p align="left">“I've heard a lot about you, you know?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? Like what?”</p><p align="left">“Well, Alice mentions you often.”</p><p align="left">“I don't know what she could possibly say about me, really. But we've known each other since we were kids.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, she told me.”</p><p align="left">“Good.” Rio smiled softly. “You're her girlfriend, and she loves you so much, Jen. So don't worry about me, our times were over years ago.”</p><p align="left">“No, that's not what I meant. I'm actually happy Alice has someone like you in her life. I know how much you guys mean to each other.” Jen sincerely said.</p><p align="left">“What are we talking about?” Alice asked as she slid into the booth and sat beside her girlfriend.</p><p align="left">“How you guys were high school sweethearts.” Jen said with a grin.</p><p align="left">“We were the sweetest,” Alice laughed, looking at Rio.</p><hr/><p align="left">“See, Alice, that's the thing. I cannot mourn in your way. I have my own way to do that it, it's not fair to force someone into doing what you think is comfortable for <em>you</em>.”</p><p align="left">“I know what you're talking about Rio, but for how long? How many months and years do you plan on mourning someone who doesn't even deserve a second from you?”</p><p align="left">“I'm not sad because of her, Alice!”</p><p align="left">“You keep telling yourself that, sweetheart. Look, I've known you for years, and I know how you deal with things like this. You deal with them by shutting yourself off completely. You destroy yourself while what you actually need is to be held, and I still don't unders...”</p><p align="left">“That is my way, Alice. My way! I don't want to pretend like my wounds are not open. If I ignore them, they would still hurt me, you know? Because me pretending they aren't fucking open won't change the fact that they're still there!” Rio snapped at Alice. She knew what kind of person she turned into whenever she was drunk and surrounded by people. Rio always hated that and she always regreted it in the morning.</p><p align="left">“Okay, I'm sorry.” Alice said and silence followed, surrounding the three of them. Blending in the air and stretching. It was suffocating.</p><p align="left">“Is that Agatha Harkness?” Jen asked as she looked at someone. Pointing at them with her eyes and her girlfriend's eyes followed her direction with visible amusement.</p><p align="left">“Who?” Rio said before she gulped her drink down.</p><p align="left">“Agatha Harkness. Oh my God, you don't know her?”</p><p align="left">“No, not really. I've never heard of a name like that. Am I supposed to know her?”</p><p align="left">“Well, technically, yes.” Alice said, looking at Rio then back at the woman who Rio assumed was <em>Agatha Harkness</em>—whoever that was</p><p align="left">“Who is she? Is she famous or something?”</p><p align="left">“Not famous as a celebrity but she's one of the greatest painters I've ever met. Seriously. I went to her gallery last year in Paris and I was stunned by her <em>and</em> her work.”</p><p align="left">Rio finally looked at the woman her friends were talking about, and what she saw was <em>an ethereal being</em>.</p><p align="left">A woman with dark hair falling behind her back and piercing blue eyes that anyone could drown deep into even from a distance. She had the perfect nose, lips and jaw. Her face was so beautiful. So comforting to look at.</p><p align="left">She was effortlessly standing with a straight spine as if she <em>knew</em> how goddamn good she looked. Lifting her chin up slightly and showing that alluring neck and throat.</p><p align="left">Her white shirt was tucked into her purple trousers and her blue trench coat looked captivating on its on. </p><p align="left">She laughed at something someone said to her. She tilted her head to the side and Rio almost feel from her chair down on the floor.</p><p align="left">The sight of the woman sobered Rio up, then made her drunk again for an <em>entirely</em> different reason.</p><p align="left">“You have seen the painting in my office, right?”</p><p align="left">Alice's voice brought Rio back to earth. </p><p align="left">Her eyes snapped open and she felt like someone had just slapped her forcefully. </p><p align="left">“W-which one?” Rio swallowed. Her mouth was dry all of the sudden.</p><p align="left">“Above the couch.” Alice gestured with her hand into the air above Rio's head.</p><p align="left">“Oh, yeah. Yeah, what about it?”</p><p align="left">“It's hers. I bought it years ago.”</p><p align="left">“Really?” Rio felt her heart pounding in her chest for no reason. It was that annoying beating that made her stomach twist and burn. “I love that painting.” she said as she senselessly turned her head around to look at that painter's captivating face again, but she was met with her back instead.</p><p align="left">“Me too, it has a special place in my heart.” </p><p align="left">“Which one baby?” Jen asked.</p><p align="left">“<em>Black: My True Love's Heart.</em>”</p><p align="left">After an hour or so, Rio definitely wasn't keeping track of the time or of the glasses of alcohol she had imbibed. Her head was a chaos and she looked behind her so many times to be counted. She found herself desperately searching the bar with her eyes for a <em>glimpse</em> of that woman.</p><p align="left">“I'm gonna pee you guys, then we should head out.”</p><p align="left">Alice and Jen hummed to her mid-kissing, and Rio gave them a grossed–out expression.</p><p align="left">“Get a room, for fuck's sake.”</p><p align="left">And she left, heading to the restroom.</p><p align="left">Rio was washing her hands while her eyes were glued at the mirror above the sink. Tracing her features with a blurry vision and looking at her drunken state. Her face and cleavage were flushed red and her eyes were heavy, fighting to stay open. </p><p align="left">She ran a wet hand through her hair as she sighed then that woman—that <em>ethereal being</em> stepped inside and Rio's heart tightened in her chest.</p><p align="left">Rio licked her lips as she kept staring at Agatha's reflection in the mirror beside her. Taking her beauty in.</p><p align="left">She inhaled deeply and a soothing scent filled her senses, sending a shiver to run down her spine.</p><p align="left">Agatha was drying her hands and Rio just stood there in her place. Frozen and staring at the reflection of a woman she didn't dare looking her in the eyes.</p><p align="left">“Gosh you're gorgeous.” Rio spoke inaudibly, yet, the sentence echoed somehow in the empty space.</p><p align="left">And her heart pounded as her words lingered.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked at Rio's reflection with a raised eyebrow and her lips were curled up in a hint of a faint smirk.</p><p align="left">Then she turned around the moment Rio did.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">“Excuse me?”</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed as she constantly blinked. Feeling her body tremble because of Agatha's deep voice.</p><p align="left">“Sorry, I'm drunk,” Rio whispered and she immediately started walking away with beating heart. Leaving Agatha behind her who she certainly heard her chuckilng <em>seductively</em>.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="left">Rio was shifting all night, the moment she crashed into her bed she couldn't even close her eyes. She kicked the duvet multiple times, switched her positions, turned the pillow to the other side, drank some water, she even counted the damn sheeps in her head but nothing was working.</p><p align="left">She was completely exhausted and drunk. Her body was drained of any energy, her eyes were burning, and the headache was making everything much worse than what it actually was. Yet, her mind refused to shut off. Refused to let her have an hour or two of peace.</p><p align="left">“Goddamn it,” Rio muttered as she sat on the bed, holding her head in her hands helplessly. She pressed on her forehead, trying to put on some pressure to find a moment or two of relief, but to no avail. Nothing was working, the universe made it as clear as crystal that nothing was on her side, not even her mind</p><p align="left">She opened the drawer of the nightstand, searching for some cigarettes or anything that could offer her a momentary sense of relief. But she found none, so Rio dragged her feet to the wardrobe, hoping there was some weed was left, even though she knew damn well there was none.</p><p align="left">She gave up, closed the wardrobe and leaned her forehead on its door. Banging it in defeat.</p><p align="left">“That's what you get for trying to be healthy, you get shit.”</p><p align="left">Rio dragged her feet around the room again, going back and forth in the dark space, until she gave up and stood in the middle of the room. She took a few seconds to breathe then Rio lay her body on the floor. The coldness of it made her shiver, and it made her more awake than before. As if it sent jolts inside her body.</p><p align="left">Rio opened her arms and stretched them freely on both sides of the floor as she gazed at the ceiling that she wasn't able to see anything of. Only darkness. </p><p align="left">“I feel like Jesus.”</p><p align="left">Seconds passed in silence. She was only able to listen to her breaths as they whirled with the stilness of the house, then Rio started laughing hysterically. Tears steamed down from her eyes as she put her hand on her stomach after laughing so hard. Feeling her muscles tense and burn inside her body.</p><p align="left">She started drawing messy patterns on the fabric of her shirt, going up and down, then in a circular motion. Repeating it a few times, it was soothing in a way.</p><p align="left">Rio exhaled deeply as she lifted her t–shirt up and started doing the same movements on her skin. Her fingers were freezing on her warm body—they were tickling and sending shivers to ran down her spine.</p><p align="left">She was looking at the ceiling, constantly blinking. Rio, with hesitation, started lowering her hand down, slowly to place it on the waistband of her shorts. The feelings she felt creeping inside her were strange, because even the idea of touching herself was revolting in many ways. The idea of pleasuring herself. Even at times when Rio needed to be touched and was turned on or ovulating—she didn't touch herself.</p><p align="left">The act of <em>pleasuring oneself</em>, Rio couldn't do that even though she knew she needed it. She wasn't satisfied enough with herself to give it that kind of pleasure. It felt wrong and unfair inside her head even if her body begged for it.</p><p align="left">A couple of minutes passed in complete silence and her hands were still resting on the waistband. Trembling in hesitation. </p><p align="left">She even forgot what an orgasm felt like. That <em>delicious</em> burning when pleasure flooded her whole. She forgot it. The feeling of when her body would quiver and her toes curl down because of the intensity of it all. She forgot that exhilarating feeling when her her muscles would tense and burn. When she would lose herself in the sensations and moan in satisfaction. Rio hadn't felt that kind of pleasure in years. She touched herself a few times here and there. Her ex disinterestedly touched her sometimes just to <em>return the favour</em>. But Rio knew it shouldn't be like that. And yet, she took it.</p><p align="left">Her fingers slowly slipped into her shorts and rested on her underwear. Moving her hesitated fingers above the fabric. Each movement felt wrong for many reasons. But she refused to back off, she needed to pull herself together for once and fuck herself instead of getting fucked.</p><p align="left">Rio exhaled deeply as her fingers started moving on her cunt above the fabric. She bent one of her legs up and started slowly palming up and down. Trying to savor the sensations.</p><p align="left">She closed her eyes as she put her leg down on the floor again and pulled her underwear to the side. Her heart tightened inside her chest and her breaths were heavy the moment she found her clit and started rubbing it slowly.</p><p align="left">She tried thinking of anything—anything that might help her reach her peak. Memories and images flashed by her eyes, but none were helpful and everything seemed to turn her off instead of the opposite.</p><p align="left">Rio squeezed her eyes even tighter as she desperately fantasized about what she <em>needed</em> at that moment while her fingers kept moving.</p><p align="left">Minutes passed and she was still struggling to reach her orgasm and get it over with.</p><p align="left">She almost gave up and started slowing her movements down, about to remove her hand and get up to her bed. As she did, the image of that woman at the bar, that <em>ethereal being</em>, Agatha Harkness popped inside her head. Rio swallowed and she involuntarily whimpered. The heat inside her body increased and her heart started pounding inside her chest. </p><p align="left">Rio couldn't quite fathom why that woman was inside her head. Why she was affecting her body that much or why her movements on her clit were faster than ever.</p><p align="left">Her eyes rolled in the back of her head as she arched her back and started picturing the dark-haired face and how beautiful it was. Flawless and perfect. She was so beautiful and even more beautiful up-close even if Rio looked at her with blurry eyes, her presence was vivid inside her head.</p><p align="left">Those blue eyes...</p><p align="left">That raised eyebrow...</p><p align="left">Her addictive scent...</p><p align="left">Her rich, pleasing laugh...</p><p align="left">Almost there. Her hand was twitching. God, she was almost there.</p><p align="left">The image of Agatha was making her heart pound and she could feel it pulsing between her thighs. She could feel the heat of herself and how fucking <em>wet</em> she was. </p><p align="left">The name of the woman was on the tip of her tongue to moan and her orgasm was building up with intensity, resting in the tips of her body waiting to flood her whole.</p><p align="left">And suddenly, her eyes snapped open to stare at the dark and her movements stopped entirely.</p><p align="left">Her chest was rising and falling, her breaths were heavy and her heart was still pounding in <em>fear</em>.</p><p align="left">“Fuck me.” Rio breathlessly cursed herself as she pulled her hands out of her underwear. “What am I doing?” the thought was floating inside her head.</p><p align="left">She wiped both of her hands in her shorts and covered her face with them. She could smell herself, her arousal—it was <em>revolting</em>.</p><p align="left">“This is <em>so</em> wrong. What the fuck is wrong with you, <em>Rio</em>?” She murmured against her palms. Scolding and calling herself out for acting like someone... Fucked in the head.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her hips and raised her ruined underwear and shorts up. Then she rose to her feet almost immediately. Her head was a spinning chaos and nausea was burning inside her stomach.</p><p align="left">She lay in bed on her side with closed eyes and an altered mind, she accepted her fate, sleep was not coming. </p><p align="left">The alarm went off and forced Rio to widely open her eyes. It was ringing loudly in her ears so she buried her face deeply in thd pillows trying to suppress the sounds.</p><p align="left">“Shut up,” she said. Her voice was muffled.</p><p align="left">Rio stretched her hand and reached for the night stand to silence the noise. But it wasn't there and the sound was making her go insane. So she removed the covers and started looking for her phone, until she found it laying right beside her head. </p><p align="left">She sighed as she turned it off then went back to bury her face in the pillows and close her eyes to see nothing but darkness.</p><p align="left">Rio couldn't feel her body at that moment. Everything, in a way, was replaced by pain. Every muscle was tense and spasming. Her head was throbbing like every morning.</p><p align="left">She lifted her head up and looked around her room with burning eyes—clothes were thrown on the floor and the chair. Mugs and glasses that needed to be sank in water for days to be clean again. Empty bottles and cans of alcohol set in different places.  Some books were resting in the corner and some exam papers were laying beside them with her glasses on top of them. She could see the dust swirling with the atmosphere, and she knew how goddamn dirty were the sheets she was lying on.</p><p align="left">The sight of the mess was agonizing by all means. Because Rio had always loved being in a clean place. She couldn't handle the dirt or throwing things carelessly, everything had its own place. But at that moment, that room looked like garbage. It matched the unorganized chaos inside her head.</p><p align="left">She looked at the time as she let out a deep breath. Rio was already late, so she called in and canceled her classes for the day. </p><p align="left">She stayed in her place for a few more, silent minutes. Lying horizontally with a throbbing head. Then got up, even though sleeping for a few more hours sounded tempting, she needed to get up.</p><p align="left">Rio washed her face and brushed her teeth then headed back to that dump of a room.</p><p align="left">She tried her best to clean up. Hours and hours of trying to make the room suitable for living again.</p><p align="left">And she was satisfied with the final result. <em>Better than nothing</em>, she told herself.</p><p align="left">After taking a cold shower, she went to the kitchen, opened the fridge, and found that basically, nothing was edible in there. She huffed and opened the wall cabinets—Rio was grateful for any and every divine power out there for the cereal she found, that she didn't even remember when she had bought.</p><p align="left">She opened the empty fridge again, took out the milk, and had the breakfast of a five–year–old kid.</p><hr/><p align="left">Hours passed by doing nothing. Everything was boring and the idea of getting out of the house tired her, let alone actually doing it.</p><p align="left">She was watching some dull documentary on some channel about paintings. Though she wasn't really paying any attention, until the name <em>Agatha Harkness</em> was mentioned and that made her open her eyes widely and focus them on the screen in disbelief as memories of last night flooded her.</p><p align="left">That documentary was old because the woman looked younger—she was discussing one of her paintings and Rio had never looked more focused on something in her entire life. </p><p align="left">She didn't even know who that woman was three days ago, what were the chances of watching her on a documentary only a few days later? Had Rio seen Agatha before that and she didn't recognize her because she didn't know her?—not that she actually knew her.</p><p align="left">But, would Rio have watched an old documentary about artists and paintings, her eyes glued to the screen, if she hadn't seen Agatha on that bar?</p><p align="left">She wouldn't have. Not even in a million years.</p><p align="left">The deep voice of the woman was soothing in many ways. It made her melt on the couch. Rio felt relaxed, safe even. It was oddly satisfying. And Rio wasn't even sure what she was listening to, she just knew that woman—<em>Agatha</em>—was looking beautiful and talking about one of her artworks.</p><p align="left">Then Agatha looked directly into the camera, and Rio felt it, as if she were looking at her. Pulling her forward. As if they were staring at each other knowingly.</p><p align="left">But they weren't.</p><p align="left">A couple of minutes passed and Agatha disappeared. Paintings filled the screen and the reporter voice was ringing, became boring again, unbearable.</p><p align="left">Rio kept her eyes glued on the screen in front of her. Just in case. Hoping Agatha would return at any second, but she didn't.</p><p align="left">Rio's mind replayed the image of her in the bar. </p><p align="left">Over and over again. She traced her features through her mind's eye, memorzing them</p><p align="left">“<em>Gosh, you're gorgeous.</em>”</p><p align="left">“<em>Excuse me?</em>”</p><p align="left">“<em>Sorry, I'm drunk.</em>”</p><p align="left">Rio covered her face in embarrassment as she remembered how stupid she acted. How her heart pounded.</p><p align="left">“You couldn't be more stupid, could you? ‘<em>Sorry, I'm drunk</em>’ who the hell wants to hear that? Oh my God.”</p><p align="left">Her scolding of herself didn't last much longer because she was interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing by her side. And of course it was Alice.</p><p align="left">“Hey, where are you?”</p><p align="left">“Home.”</p><p align="left">“Are you kidding? Why haven't you responded to my messages then?”</p><p align="left">“What messages? I didn't see anything.”</p><p align="left">“Jesus Christ, Rio. I asked you yesterday if you could make it to the party tonight.”</p><p align="left">“Hold on, hold on, what party? What messages? What's the occasion? And the answer is no.”</p><p align="left">“Can you please just shut up? It's a par...”</p><p align="left">“No I won't shut up, I'll hang up now, bye”</p><p align="left">“I'll come to your house and drag you from there, and you know I would.”</p><p align="left">“Alright, alright, stay right where you are. What's the party for? Who is getting married?”</p><p align="left">“Just shut up and let me talk.” Alice said. Then continued when she didn't hear a response from Rio. “Alright, so Jen and I were planning to have a party for a long time now, my friends, her friends, our friends’ friends and others. There's no particular occasion; we just wanted to have some fun. But to be honest, I want to propose to her tonight. I've been thinking about it for a month now, and I think tonight is the night. And I really, really want you to be there, Rio. So please say you'll come.”</p><p align="left">“You're abusing me Alice, because that's a lot, and you know socializing tortures me. But sure, I'll be there.”</p><p align="left">“Oh my God, really?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah dude, and I'm really happy for you, I think I'm gonna cry.”</p><p align="left">“Don't,” Alice said with a chuckle. “Be there at 9. Love you. Take care of yourself, yeah?”</p><p align="left">“Love you too, Alice. And you too. Take care of yourself.” She said and hung up.</p><p align="left">She let out a breath she didn't know she was holding.</p><p align="left">
<em>Well, party.</em>
</p><hr/><p align="left">After feeling bad for herself this morning, she decided to at least buy the groceries that she needed the most.</p><p align="left">She put on a green hoodie and her good to go trousers and stepped out of the house.</p><p align="left">The weather was great, and the cold breeze was welcoming, brushing her hair to the side and making her nose red. The coldness sent an electric wave to travel through her entire body, and that made her smile. A sudden attack of delight made her feel better.</p><p align="left">She walked from section to section, picking up only what she felt was necessary, as if her fridge wasn't crying to be filled for months.</p><p align="left">She steeped outside, lit a cigarette and took the first puff. The smoke filled her lungs and senses. The burning sensation rested in her throat, and the sudden rush of nicotine in her body made her relax as her muscles loosened. She walked to her car, put the bags in the back and headed home. She was feeling good.</p><p align="left">Around 7 PM, she sat on the couch looking through photos, trying to waste some time.</p><p align="left">And there it was, a photo she had forgotten to delete.</p><p align="left">Her ex–girlfriend kissing her cheek as Rio looked directly at the camera with a silly grin on her face. Her eyes were full of love and appreciation.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at herself in the photo for minutes before she deleted it and threw her phone away.</p><p align="left">One of her sudden panic attacks took control of her entire body. Anxiety coursed through her veins, Rio felt like her heart would break through her rib cage and escape her chest.</p><p align="left">She started sweating so she got up from the couch, and tried to breathe, once, twice. Again and again. Her legs lost the ability to stand, so she lowered her head looking at the ground, trying to put her weight on her knees.</p><p align="left">Dizziness began to take control of her head, making her feel numb and acutely aware of everything at the same time. She remembered how her mother used to hold her during her panic attacks as a kid, and how her whole body would relax and regain its normal state, but not at that moment—no one was there to hold her. No one was ever there to hold her.</p><p align="left">So, she fell beside the couch onto the floor with a loud thud and tried to hold herself as tightly as she could, embracing her body while trying to steady her breaths.</p><p align="left">“<em>It will be fine, Rio. It will be fine, Rio. It will be fine, Rio.</em>”</p><p align="left">She kept repeating that sentence over and over again, until she was able to breathe normally again. Her head was still dizzy and her vision was blurry from the tears that fell from her eyes unconsciously. She sat onthe cold floor for several minutes, trying to get herself back.</p><p align="left">Then she got up, wiped the tears with the back of her hand while walking toward the bottle of vodka that was setting on the table.</p><p align="left">She poured the first glass and drank it in one swig. The burning in her mouth led her to pour the second. During the third one she realized that she—unfortunately—had somewhere to go in an hour and a half. She abandoned the bottle and went upstairs. Washing her face five times with cold water without looking at her reflection, because she knew what she would see there.</p><p align="left">By 8:30 PM she was ready—a navy-blue blazer, a dress shirt in the same color and a black trousers. Having opened the first three buttons of her shirt to leave a space to show her cleavage and that necklace that she refused to take off.</p><p align="left">Red lipstick, black eyeliner, and letting her hair fall down to her shoulders.</p><p align="left">She drove to Alice's place, took a few minutes to prepare herself while leaning on her seat, then she got out. Before knocking on the door, it swung open, revealing Alice.</p><p align="left">“Rio! You're here!”</p><p align="left">“I guess I am.” Rio said with a soft smile as she handed Alice the bottle of wine she brought with her.</p><p align="left">“God, I'm so happy you're here! come on in.”</p><p align="left">Alice moved aside so Rio could step in. Many people were there—people she either didn't know or didn't recognize.</p><p align="left">“You look gorgeous.”</p><p align="left">Alice said with a smile on her lips as she looked at Rio</p><p align="left">“Thanks Alice. You look really beautiful too, this color really suits you.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh</em>, thank you.” Alice blushed. “You won't believe who is here, but now come with me, I need to show you something.”</p><p align="left">Rio followed Alice to one of the empty rooms. Alice took out a small box from her pocket, opened it, and waited for Rio's reaction. Rio looked at the radiant ring inside, then looked at Alice while smiling.</p><p align="left">“Alice, this is so beautiful! Without exaggerating. I think it's one of the prettiest rings I've ever seen.”</p><p align="left">“Really? Do you think she'd like it?”</p><p align="left">“She would love it. Trust me.”</p><p align="left">They both smiled at each other and then left the room to engage with the party's vibes.</p><p align="left">Rio was laughing at something Alice had said when she looked up to see that dark-haired woman with her piercing, <em>hypnotizing</em> blue eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio couldn't believe her eyes, so she glanced at Alice who was already looking at Agatha.</p><p align="left">“This is who I wanted to tell you is here.” Alice said as she met Rio's gaze.</p><p align="left">“What is she doing here?” Rio whispere.</p><p align="left">“I don't know. I seriously don't know. She came here with a friend of a friend. Lilia. I still cannot believe it. I haven't even talked to her yet cause I'm afraid I'll look like an obsessed fangirl.”</p><p align="left">Rio looked once more at the woman.</p><p align="left">Agatha met her gaze from across the room and time stopped for a few seconds.</p><p align="left">Rio tried to look relaxed but she couldn't, so she immediately looked away with a pounding heart and embarrassing memories of last night flooded her head.</p><p align="left">She grabbed one of the champagne glasses from a passing tray and gluped it down in an attempt to busy herself with it. She couldn't look at the woman.</p><p align="left">Why would she be here? Why now?</p><p align="left">“Come, I want you to meet some of my friends.” Alice broke the silence and brought Rio back—she was grateful for that.</p><p align="left">Alice walked and Rio followed by her side. She introduced her to some of her friends whom Rio knew she'd forget about by tomorrow morning or once she'd step out of this house.</p><p align="left">“Look who is here, Rio Vidal!” A voice filled with amusement came from behind her. Rio turned her face toward the source as she put her glass down.</p><p align="left">Her eyes were gleaming and an honest, warm smile formed on her lips the moment she saw Lilia.</p><p align="left">“God, Lilia!”</p><p align="left">They embraced each other warmly. Wrapping their arms around one another.</p><p align="left">“I missed you, kid.” Lilia said as she pulled back and held Rio's hand tightly in hers.</p><p align="left">“So did I,” Rio said sincerely, she had always loved Lilia.</p><p align="left">“How are you doing?” Lilia asked with that mothery, concerned voice of hers.</p><p align="left">“Fine. Good, doing good.” </p><p align="left">Lilia knew she was lying and Rio knew she knew. The older woman always had a way of seeing right through her, but she never pushed her.</p><p align="left">“How is your new project?” Rio asked in an attempt to change the topic and spot the light on something other than herself.</p><p align="left">“Great. So far, I'm really proud of what we have achieved. I've been working with this amazing artist, Rio. You should meet her.”</p><p align="left">Lilia looked at Rio with a bright smile. “Come, I'll introduce you to her. You'd love her.” she took Rio's hand in hers and walked her through the room.</p><p align="left">Rio's heart raced inside her chest as they started walking closer to the woman Lilia was talking about and Rio realized who she was. Rio couldn't even breathe the moment they stood in front of her.</p><p align="left">“Agatha darling, this is Rio.”</p><p align="left">Agatha's eyes sparked upon hearing Rio's name for the first time. As if she was waiting to hear it.</p><p align="left">Agatha extended her hand with a smirk and a delighted look in her gleaming eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio hesitated for a brief second before shaking it. Rio's hand trembled after the unexpected connection that she, in fact, had anticipated.</p><p align="left">She felt Agatha's hand in hers. It was soft. It made her heart pound. It felt right in hers. And Rio wanted to run away because it was overwhelming.</p><p align="left">“I was telling Rio about our project,” Lilia said as her eyes drifted between the two women.</p><p align="left">Agatha's eyes never left Rio's face even though Rio refused to meet her gaze. She couldn't do that. </p><p align="left">What if Agatha recognized her?</p><p align="left">They talked for a few minutes. Mostly, it was Agatha and Lilia exchanging topics, because for some reason, Rio couldn't find her own voice. She couldn't talk or engage, not when she was <em>that</em> close to the woman and she could smell her with every inhale.</p><p align="left">“I'll leave you girls to know each other, I have dozens of people to see.” Lilia patted Rio on the shoulder and left. Leaving her alone.</p><p align="left">Rio froze in her place, if she wanted to move her legs she wouldn't be able to do so. It was as if someone had poured cement on her feet and glued her to the floor.</p><p align="left">She felt Agatha's eyes on her, looking at every feature, as if she was observing her.</p><p align="left">So Rio lifted her head, and met her blue eyes for the third time.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">Her heart raced.</p><p align="left">And she knew she was blushing from the alcohol in her system and because of who was standing in front of her.</p><p align="left">“<em>Rio</em>.” Agatha said her name for the second time, as if she was tasting how it sounded. Finding delight and pleasure in saying it out loud. Victory in knowing it.</p><p align="left">“Where have we met?”</p><p align="left">If Rio was frozen before, then she became a statue the moment the question landed on her ears.</p><p align="left">“I–I don't really know.” Rio said. “Have we? Met, I mean?” she was such a bad liar and she knew it. She was sweating for fuck's sake.</p><p align="left">“I think it was 3 days ago,” Agatha said with a smirk, refusing to change the subject. She was clearly enjoying herself.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her again. Taking her in the same way she did at the bar.</p><p align="left">Looking at her clothes—adark blue suit, a black high–necked top and a golden necklace. Rio realized they were wearing similar shades of blue.</p><p align="left">Rio looked back at Agatha who was already looking at her with lips curled up in a knowing smile.</p><p align="left">“Where?” Rio finally said. Still denying it, because the memory was too embarrassing to handle or even to talk about. </p><p align="left">“At the bar?” Agatha said with a raised eyebrow and an amused smirk. “And I quote...” she licked her lips. “‘<em>Gosh, you're gorgeous.</em>’” Agatha said Rio's words as she looked <em>straight</em> into her eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio's face turned red and her body trembled. Hearing Agatha say it like that, out loud, did something to her—it made her heart tighten in her chest.</p><p align="left">Embarrassment flooded her whole being but there was something... else.</p><p align="left">Something about Agatha's anticipated look and delighted smirk. Something about Agatha's whole presence. Something about <em>Agatha</em>...</p><p align="left">“I told you I was drunk.” Rio whispered as she clenched her glass in her hold and briefly looked down at the floor.</p><p align="left">Agatha laughed. The rich sound came out of her throat in a low, deep tone. <em>Seductively</em>. Laughter had never sounded that intoxicating.</p><p align="left">Her laughter made Rio look up at her and smiled in return as she saw the jaw in her face.</p><p align="left">“I know sweetheart, but I have to tell you, you looked <em>adorable</em>.”</p><p align="left">Rio was not doing well after that sentence.</p><p align="left">“What do you do, <em>Rio</em>?” It felt as if Agatha loved how Rio's name sounded in her mouth—the taste of it.</p><p align="left">“I'm an English professor,” Rio said while nodding with her head without a reason. Spinning from her glass and drifting her eyes up and down. She was nervous.</p><p align="left">“And you? No wait, I actually know. My friend Alice told me about you.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? I'm an artist, I mostly paint.” Agatha smiled. Her smile was bright, reaching all the way up to her eyes.</p><p align="left">She looked beautiful.</p><p align="left">“It suits you,” her tongue slipped.</p><p align="left">“How?” Agatha asked with an amused tone as she took a step toward Rio. And Rio's heart fell down to her stomach as she inhaled her in. She was <em>too</em> close.</p><p align="left">“I—” </p><p align="left">“Hi, I'm Alice.” Alice interrupted the moment by awkwardly introducing herself. And Agatha immediately took a step back, putting a space between them.</p><p align="left">And Rio kept looking at her as her mouth watered and her stomach tensed and burned.</p><p align="left">“Nice to meet you, Alice. Agatha Harkness.” she said as they shook hands.</p><p align="left">“I don't really know if you remember me, but... we met last year in Paris.” Alice said with a nervous smile on her face.“I just wanted to tell you it's actually an honor for me to have you here ms. Harkness.”</p><p align="left">“Thank you. The honor is truly mine. It's a really great party you have in here.” Agatha said as she looked at Alice, then at Rio—her eyes lingered there for a few long seconds before they drifted back to Alice. “And forgive me for not remembering you.”</p><p align="left">“No, no, I completely understand.” Alice grinned.</p><p align="left">Rio couldn't help but to stare at the woman in front of her as she talked with her friend. Noticing everything about her. She was... Intoxicating.</p><p align="left">And Agatha seemed to notice every time Rio's eyes landed on her. Because every time her lips would curl up and she'd glance at Rio only for a second.</p><p align="left">“Excuse me but I have to steal Rio for a moment.” Alice said and then dragged Rio with her.</p><p align="left">“What?” Rio asked.</p><p align="left">“Dude, I'm nervous.”</p><p align="left">“Why?”</p><p align="left">“There's too many people here, I should've thought about that.”</p><p align="left">“Hey, don't worry. Look it's just for a few moments, you know? Once you propose you'd be lost in the bubble that contains only the both of you and you'll forget about everybody else. But if you're not comfortable with it then just do it in a private place where you'd feel completely comfortable.”</p><p align="left">“I want to do it now.”</p><p align="left">“Then go get it, tiger!” Rio grinned.</p><p align="left">Alice looked at her for a few seconds then nodded. “Alright, wish me luck.” </p><p align="left">“Good luck!”</p><p align="left">And with that Alice walked toward Jen who was standing among people. Alice looked Jen in the eyes, then took the small black box out of her pocket, knelt on one knee and opened the box while asking Jen to marry her.</p><p align="left">Jen said <em>yes</em> with a blush, then they kissed. Passionately. Warmly. With love. Their smiles visible on their features even with their mouths deeply connected.</p><p align="left">Rio was watching them with a big smile and a tear hanging on the edge of her eye. Admiring the sight of the lovebirds and how happy they were.</p><p align="left">How happy she was for them.</p><p align="left">“They're beautiful together.”</p><p align="left">A voice from beside her said, and it was Agatha.</p><p align="left">Their shoulders were almost touching because of how close they were.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her, smiling. “They are.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="left">Rio arrived at work on time. It was the first day in months. She woke up feeling great, nothing bothered her all morning, not even herself.</p><p align="left">She was sitting in her office, sipping her coffee with a little humming sound coming out of her as she did the work she should've completed months ago.</p><p align="left">Rio took a rest as she cracked her fingers and leaned back on the chair. She closed her eyes and let out a soft sigh and her mind drifted to Agatha.</p><p align="left">She inhaled deeply as she remembered her—as if Rio forgot her in the first place.</p><p align="left">That woman was possessing Rio's whole being since that party.</p><p align="left">The way they felt so close yet too far away.</p><p align="left">Rio couldn't really understand the strange connection she felt that linked her to Agatha in some way, or why it even existed.</p><p align="left">Two days ago, at the party, after they had a few conversations here and there. Shared some laughed and toasts, Rio momentarily had thought Agatha would give her her number at some point in the night, or mention something close to that, or even ask Rio for hers.</p><p align="left">But Agatha disappeared after a while and Rio couldn't find her after that. She searched for her with her eyes all evening, but it seemed like Agatha had gone home.</p><p align="left">And Rio didn't realize that the last time she looked into Agatha's blue eyes was actually the last time she looked into them.</p><p align="left">She sighed again as her fingers hovered over the keyboard. She hesitated as she typed the first letter and looked at the screen. Then as if her fingers started working on their own, she typed Agatha Harkness' name absentmindedly.</p><p align="left">Results appeared once Rio clicked <em>enter—</em>photos of Agatha. Very limited information about her. And her artworks. </p><p align="left">Rio looked at Agatha with focused eyes. Admiring her sharp features and how beautiful she looked in every photo. Every pose. And every quality. </p><p align="left">Rio Read the information that the internet allowed her the access to, but there wasn't much—just some articles that barely contained anything. But nonetheless, Rio read every line at least two times.</p><p align="left">She scrolled down, viewing the few artworks attached to the article she was reading. She observed them carefully. Each one looked like it possessed a piece of Agatha. They looked like her in many ways.</p><p align="left">Rio wasn't practically invested in paintings even though art was a huge part of her childhood, but she could see and feel how every painting screamed Agatha's name one way or another—her art style. The colors she used. The themes. The details every painting held and offered. Even the subjects.</p><p align="left">Rio examined each one of them closely. Tying to figure out how and why each one of them was Agatha. Trying to interrupt them.</p><p align="left">She noticed the number of portraits of women and the naked bodies. Some paintings felt intimate, flooding with emotions—the angles, the poses, the women themselves. And Rio found herself wondering if those women were Agatha's partners or her muses. Wondering what they meant to her and what she meant to them.</p><p align="left">The artist and their muse relationship.</p><p align="left">Then she looked at the last painting the article offered a glimpse of. A reproduction of the one Alice had the original copy of in her office. The one that offered a sense of terrifying belonging.</p><p align="left">Rio had always loved that painting and felt a kind of connection to it—something she couldn't quite name but still felt. She always took a deep look at it whenever she stepped into her best friend's office.</p><p align="left">The painting contained only three dark-shaded colors colors. Black, red and a dark shade of gray.</p><p align="left">It wasn't obvious what the picture truly represented, what it was about, or why it filled Rio's heart with a sense of remorse every time she looked at it. That  one, in a way, didn't resemble any painting of Agatha's, it was strangely different. It held something within its strictly limited details, and Rio was curious to discover what was so special—so overwhelming—about that piece. Why it felt <em>personal </em>and even its title was pulling?</p><p align="left">
<em>Black: My True Love's Heart.</em>
</p><p align="left">Rio tried to collect the information she had found, but it was merely useless. All she found about it was its title and the date it was displayed. There wasn't anything about Agatha talking about the artwork or some critical article about it. It was like a deep piece and Rio wanted to dig in to feed her curiosity.</p><hr/><p align="left">The workday had come to an end, Rio gathered her things and stepped outside the office, meeting Alice in the hallway.</p><p align="left">“Hey, you,” Alice greeted her with a smile.</p><p align="left">“Hey,” Rio replied, mirroring Alice's smile.</p><p align="left">They walked in silence for a few minutes until Rio broke it.</p><p align="left">“Um, so, I wanted to ask you about something,”</p><p align="left">Alice looked at her, offering a look to continue.</p><p align="left">“About that painting in your office—Agatha's.”</p><p align="left">“What about it?”</p><p align="left">“What do you know about it?”</p><p align="left">“Not much really. I bought it years ago, because when I looked at it for the first time, I felt like I should have it. The only thing I know is that it's one of Agatha's earliest works, from when she was in college, I believe. She hadn't painted much at the time, yet she refused to show her work to the public eye—epecially this one. But years after her graduation she started publishing her work. I don't really know what it's about—like, the topic of it. I don't think that I actually understand the true meaning behind the painting, but it kept growing in me. It's that kind of piece, you know?</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh</em>,” was the only response Rio offered in return. “Yeah, I know.” She said in a low tone, barely audible.</p><p align="left">“Yeah, you should ask Lilia, she definitely knows something—if not everything.”</p><p align="left">As they continued walking, silence stretched and began enveloping them.</p><p align="left">“What were you two talking about, anyway?” Alice asked as she walked beside Rio.</p><p align="left">“Who?”</p><p align="left">“You and Agatha.”</p><p align="left">“Oh, nothing really,” Rio paused. “Lilia introduced me to her.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? Because, I think that woman was looking at you—like really looking at you.” Alice said, enjoyment filled her tone.</p><p align="left">Rio stared into space, thinking about what Alice was aiming at.</p><p align="left">Agatha wasn't looking at her in any way. Why would she do that?</p><p align="left">Moments of silence followed her friend's words as they reached the parking lot. </p><p align="left">“How do you mean?” Rio spoke after a while.</p><p align="left">“I don't know, but I felt something was there.” </p><p align="left">“Alice, you're delusional.” Rio replied and got into her car without looking back at Alice.</p><p align="left">“We'll see about that! See you!” Alice was practically screaming at that point.</p><p align="left">Rio only laughed and started the engine, pretending that Alice's conclusions did not matter.</p><p align="left">Because they didn't.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't go home, instead she stayed outside the walls of her empty, depressing house. </p><p align="left">She gifted herself a proper meal at a restaurant, considering it a self–date, because she needed that and she had already begun forgetting what real food actually tasted like.</p><p align="left">Once at home, she collapsed onto the couch after taking off her shoes and jacket. The dimly lit living room was forcing Rio to close her eyes but after a brief second she forced them open. “No, not today, Rio.”</p><p align="left">Then she stood on her feet and headed to the bathroom to take the peaceful, warm bath she deserved.</p><p align="left">She wrapped herself in a towel, went back to her bedroom and grabbed the same oversized t–shirt that she always found comfort in wearing.</p><p align="left">She sat on the bed. Nothing was in her head to waste the remaining time of the day. She thought about calling Alice so they could go out for some drinks but it was too early for that, instead she called Lilia.</p><p align="left">“Hello?” There was some noise in Lilia's side.</p><p align="left">“Hey, kid. Nice hearing your voice.”</p><p align="left">Rio laughed. “Are you busy?”</p><p align="left">“Not really, do you want something?”</p><p align="left">“Well, I thought, do you want to go out?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah sure why not. Are you hungry?”</p><p align="left">“No, not really”</p><p align="left">“Okay then, just give me an hour.”</p><p align="left">“Alright.”</p><p align="left">So she got up, put on some clothes—a t–shirt, a jacket, and trousers, did her hair, applied her makeup on, and went out.</p><p align="left">She drove to the café where she was supposed to meet Lilia, and she was already there.</p><p align="left">They hugged once Rio approached her, then she sat facing her. </p><p align="left">“How are you doing?” Lilia asked.</p><p align="left">“Fine, good. What about you?”</p><p align="left">“Great. Here, I got you your coffee.”</p><p align="left">“Thanks. And yours?”</p><p align="left">“Nope, no caffeine for me darling.”</p><p align="left">They talked for a while. About their lives recently though there wasn't much to talk about really in Rio's side. It was a routine. She had been living a routine for a quite sometime.</p><p align="left">“I wanted to ask you something.”</p><p align="left">Lilia looked at her, “Go on.”</p><p align="left">“About that painting of Agatha Harkness, <em>Black: My True Love's Heart</em>. Do you it?”</p><p align="left">“What about it?”</p><p align="left">“I don't know. I just feel something when I look at it, something strange. I asked Alice about it today, because she has it, you know? But—um, she didn't really know much about it.” Rio paused to take a sip from her drink while looking at Lilia. “She said you might know something.”</p><p align="left">“I maybe do.” Lilia said as she searched Rio's face with her eyes.</p><p align="left">“What do you know? I'm just curious about it.”</p><p align="left">“What makes it curious to you?”</p><p align="left">“I—I don't know. It's pulling in a way. Not something specific about the piece—but the painting as a whole.”</p><p align="left">“Mhmm. Why I'm not surprised you find that specific piece pulling? Of all Agatha's artwork.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, well, I looked up her artwork... And yeah, that one was different in many ways.”</p><p align="left">“You looked Agatha up?” Lilia said with a brow raised in obvious delight.</p><p align="left">“Yes—I actually did. For no reason really, I just did.” Rio stammered. She was blushing, caught off guard.</p><p align="left">“Well, darling, that painting is really personal to Agatha.” Lilia spoke as she looked outside the window then back to meet Rio's eyes.</p><p align="left">“I also felt that pulling toward that painting, it was the reason why I wanted to meet Agatha in the first place. When I asked her about it when we first met years ago, her expressions completely changed upon me mentioning it. She said the painting was never meant to be left exposed to the public's eyes and people' opinions, but she was in deep need of money at the time and a friend of hers offered to display it in their exhibition, that friend was her ex-wife.”</p><p align="left">Rio nodded as she sharply listened to what Lilia was saying. Completely absorbed in what she had to offer.</p><p align="left">“Agatha didn't talk about the process of painting it or what it meant to her—but she said it's her most spiritual work, and it defines her the most.” </p><p align="left">Rio blinked several times until she realized Lilia has stopped talking.</p><p align="left">“Is—is she always that mysterious?”</p><p align="left">“Yes, always. She doesn't let anybody in. And her intensity makes her the great artist that she is. Honestly, she's one of the greatest artists I've ever met and worked with.”</p><p align="left">Rio felt like she was left with no answers but more questions, and she needed something to quell her curiosity.</p><p align="left">They talked for a while about nothing and everything all at once. Every topic led to another until they were out of things to talk about and found themselves asking each other how are they again.</p><p align="left">“Now, kid, you should take me home.”</p><p align="left">“You didn't come in your car?”</p><p align="left">“No, I took a cab, but since you're here, I'm depending on you.”</p><p align="left">“So, you're taking advantage of me?”</p><p align="left">“Exactly, but I'll cook you dinner.”</p><p align="left">“Well, that's tempting, I like it. I'm your <em>chauffeur</em> this evening.”</p><p align="left">Rio chuckled as she got up from her chair and Lilia followed her movements.</p><hr/><p align="left">Once Rio parked the car in front of Lilia's house and was about to step out, Lilia spoke, “Agatha is staying with me for a few days until she finds the place that she wants, she...”</p><p align="left">“Jesus, Lilia, why are you telling me this <em>now</em>?” Rio was stunned.</p><p align="left">“What? I didn't think it would be a problem,”</p><p align="left">Rio sighed, “It's not. It's—it's not a problem, but you could've told me before.”</p><p align="left">“I forgot,”</p><p align="left">“No, you didn't. You want me to meet her, again.”</p><p align="left">“Shut up, Sherlock.” Lilia said as she unfastened her seatbelt. “Anyway, Agatha doesn't live in LA, she settles in Paris, so she's staying with me for now,” Lilia said and got out of the car, slamming the door in Rio's face.</p><p align="left">Rio was absolutely shocked because, <em>damn</em>. She wasn't ready for that. </p><p align="left">Lilia knocked on the window telling Rio to get out, and so she did.</p><p align="left">Lilia opened the door and motioned for Rio to step inside. She was nervous, an anxiety rush traveled through her entire body and settled in her stomach. Her heart was pounding and her face was red because of the blood that was rushing to it.</p><p align="left">They got in and Rio walked ans sat on the couch. There were no signs of Agatha, which was good—because Rio really needed to breathe.</p><p align="left">“Do you want something to drink, dear?” Lilia called from the kitchen.</p><p align="left">Rio got up and followed her there.</p><p align="left">“Oh God, yes please!”</p><p align="left">“Here,” Lilia handed her a glass of red wine.</p><p align="left">They returned to the living room and sat opposite each other. They were talking about something but Rio's mind couldn't really focus on the conversation, she was thinking about Agatha who still hadn't shown any sign of showing up.</p><p align="left">“Are you alright?” Lilia asked with a concerned tone.</p><p align="left">“Yeah. Yeah, totally—I just zoned out.”</p><p align="left">Then the door swung open. <em>Agatha</em>.</p><p align="left">Rio's eyes immediately found hers once she turned around, and Agatha did the same thing.</p><p align="left">Because seeing Rio here... a stunned expression overtook Agatha's face for a brief second, but she quickly replaced it with a smile, and Rio noticed that, how could she not?</p><p align="left">“I just went out to buy something,” Agatha said as she sat a plastic bag on the table. Speaking with Lilia while looking at Rio.</p><p align="left">“Well, Rio's here and she's staying for dinner. You know her.” Lilia said as she also looked at Rio, there was too much gazing on her direction.</p><p align="left">“Yes, I do know her.” Agatha smirked. Her voice was laced with delight.</p><p align="left">Rio realized that she was also <em>staring</em>, so she sprang to her feet, took a few steps toward Agatha and extended her hand for Agatha to shake.</p><p align="left">And Agatha gladly did.</p><p align="left">“Nice seeing you again, <em>Rio</em>.” Agatha said. This time she wasn't tasting the sound of Rio's name, she was <em>devouring</em> it with great pleasure.</p><p align="left">“Likewise,” Rio replied, then she withdraw her hand from Agatha's hold and sat back down on the couch with a deep exhale that she prayed nobody heard the depth of.</p><p align="left">“Excuse me for a few minutes ladies. I'll be right back.” Agatha glanced at Lilia and then back at Rio—her eyes lingered on Rio's face for a few long seconds.</p><p align="left">“Take your time darling,” Lilia replied.</p><p align="left">Then Agatha walked away toward what Rio assumed was the room she was staying in.</p><p align="left">And six minutes later, she returned. Rio counted the seconds of those six minutes—of course she did.</p><p align="left">Agatha was wearing an oversized earthy green button–up shirt and black sweatpants. Rio found herself looking at her and Agatha seemed to notice that too.</p><p align="left">She looked like she was considering the options, whether to sit beside Rio or Lilia and she ended up choosing Lilia's side.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't even know if she should be relieved by her choice or disappointed. She was a mess.</p><p align="left">“What do we want for dinner?” Lilia asked, her eyes drifting between them both.</p><p align="left">“Anything really,” Rio replied.</p><p align="left">“The Chicken Florentine Pasta that you made the other day? I can still taste it, so I'd very much love to eat it again.” Agatha said enthusiastically while looking at Lilia.</p><p align="left">“Great, easy and delicious.” Lilia approved.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at Lilia then her gaze drifted to Agatha and the open buttons of her shirt. Rio absentmindedly licked her lips at the sight and <em>of course</em> Agatha noticed and threw an unreadable smirk and look to Rio's side.</p><p align="left">Rio blushed, feeling her body getting hotter and she tried her best to busy herself with the last few drops of wine that were left in the bottom of her glass.</p><p align="left">A minute later, Agatha got up with grace. She went to the kitchen, and came back with two glasses filled with wine.</p><p align="left">Agatha walked toward Rio and Rio felt her heart racing with every step Agatha took in her direction until she approached her and was standing in front of her. Agatha looked down at Rio as offered her a glass of wine. And Rio's heart stopped for a heartbeat or two.</p><p align="left">Once Rio took the glass and whispered a barely audible “<em>Thank you.</em>” Agatha leaned in front of her, way <em>too</em> close. Rio felt as if time had stopped in that second. She could smell Agatha's intoxicating scent and feel her presence. But Rio didn't dare look down at Agatha's cleavage, instead she closed her eyes, overwhelmed, until Agatha was up again holding Rio's empty glass then she set it on the coffee table with a smirk.</p><p align="left">Rio was dumbstruck. Agatha clinked her glass to hers, the moment Rio heard the sound she felt herself being pulled back to earth.</p><p align="left">“Cheers.” Agatha said then she took a sip.</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed hard as she looked at Agatha's amused eyes.</p><p align="left">“Cheers.” she whispered with a pounding heart.</p><p align="left">They both looked at each other for a few long, intense seconds as they sipped their drinks.</p><p align="left">Brown met blue and assorted with it for a fleeting moment, then Agatha broke the moment by looking away. She walked and sat back down in her spot beside Lilia.</p><p align="left">Lilia broke the silence that stretched and embraced the three of them, “Alright girls, I'm gonnr make us dinner, you rest here. Get to know each other.” and with that she left, leaving Rio alone with Agatha.</p><p align="left">The silence that embraced them seconds ago started to firmly choke Rio, but Agatha loosened its grip on Rio's throat with that sweet voice of hers, rich with depth.</p><p align="left">A one–word question.</p><p align="left">“How?”</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her, confused. </p><p align="left">“What?”</p><p align="left">“You said at the party that what I do suits me. I asked you <em>how?</em> but I didn't get the chance to hear your answer.” Agatha said with a smirk, then she took a sip from her drink. Looking at Rio from behind the glass.</p><p align="left">
<em>Why did this woman always start her conversations with such intensity?</em>
</p><p align="left"><em>Because you left</em>. Rio thought to herself, but of course she didn't say that, that was a forbidden territory.</p><p align="left">“You've got an incredible memory.” Rio chuckled.</p><p align="left">“One of my blessings.”</p><p align="left">Rio's mind paused longer than necessary, she couldn't think of anything to start with.</p><p align="left">“So, how?”</p><p align="left">“It's just, you know, it suits you. I can't really imagine you being in a normal job or anything else.” a pause. “Being an artist, I mean, it suits you. You, you look artistic. I mean, yeah, like a painting.” The words slipped from her tongue and it was tot late. That should have stayed in her head.</p><p align="left">Rio realized the words that came out of her mouth and drank what was left in her drink—which was the whole goddamn glass.</p><p align="left">“Easy there.” Agatha said, looking at Rio with intensity and something more—<em>so much more</em>.</p><p align="left">The empty glass was resting in Rio's hand. She was clenching it firmly as she looked at Agatha.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked and neither of them was ready to look away. As if both of them were daring each other, testing the waters.</p><p align="left">Rio felt herself stuck in that moment. In that place. With that woman. Part of her wanted to stay because it felt so good to be stuck with Agatha. But she also wasn't able to handle it—to handle all those unexplainable things she was feeling—the floating emotions, the creeping sensations, the way her heart was tightening, and the charged atmosphere.</p><p align="left">The way Agatha was looking at her, the woman's eyes were seductive—an ocean of blue that Rio was willing to be drowned in.</p><p align="left">She needed to go somewhere else.</p><p align="left">“I'm—” she cleared her throat. “I'm gonna see if Lilia needs anything.”</p><p align="left">
<em>An escape.</em>
</p><p align="left">With that, Rio left her spot on the couch and walked toward the kitchen. With every step she took, she felt Agatha's eyes on her.</p><p align="left">“Do you need anything?” Rio awkwardly approached. </p><p align="left">Lilia looked at her, “No darling, I told you to rest.”</p><p align="left">“I don't really need to.” Rio paused, “I'm gonna be outside for a minute.”</p><p align="left">“Are you alright?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, no, I'm fine, I just... need a smoke.”</p><p align="left">“Rio Vidal, when did you start smoking again?”</p><p align="left">“Five days ago, Lilia Calderu.”</p><p align="left">“Kid, don't do that to yourself!” Lilia said, pointing a spoon at her.</p><p align="left">“Okay,” Rio chuckled as she left the kitchen and heard Lilia's heavy sigh.</p><p align="left">She was heading to the front door when a voice made her stop mid-step.</p><p align="left">“Going somewhere?” Agatha asked and she was already on her feet. She finished her glass and set it on the coffee table. Then she wiped the edges of her mouth with her thumb. And Rio—<em>poor Rio</em>—she looked at every motion Agatha did.</p><p align="left">“Um, no—” She swallowed. “I just need a cigarette.” Rio said as she took the package out of her pocket.</p><p align="left">“Do you mind if I join you?”</p><p align="left">“Of course not.”</p><p align="left">Rio lit the cigarettes for them and they smoked in silence. The sound of the burning paper filled their ears and the atmosphere between them. The cold breeze added a layer of intensity.</p><p align="left">Words were resting on the tips of their tongues. They both desperately wanted to say something to break the silence, to hear each other's voices, but none of them did.</p><p align="left">They only looked at each other. Their eyes traced their features as they searched one another's face. Their eyes were filled with intensity, unspoken words, and a hanging promise somewhere.</p><p align="left">When they went back inside, Lilia saw them, like if she had caught some kids sneaking in.</p><p align="left">“I just want to know why people don't care about their health.”</p><p align="left">Agatha looked at Rio and they both laughed without responding.</p><p align="left">They were all chatting in the kitchen. Helping Lilia and talking about different things.</p><p align="left">Rio found it easy to talk with Agatha if someone else was there with them. Things felt less awkward, and Rio was able to find her own voice.</p><p align="left">But every time their eyes met, Rio remained silent, no matter what the topic was or what they were talking about, and it also didn't matter if she was in the middle of a sentence.</p><p align="left">Rio was saying something about some college students when her eyes met Agatha's. Rio's heart rapidly pounded and she became quiet all of a sudden. It felt as if Agatha's eyes were a maze and she was lost in them, unable to find the entrance or the exit. She didn't even know which one she wanted to find.</p><p align="left">“Rio, are you alright?” Lilia's voice brought her back.</p><p align="left">“Yeah, absolutely.” She paused as she took the plates from the counter. “I'm gonna take these.”</p><p align="left">She placed them on the dining table. Rio took a deep breathe then turned around to go back to the kitchen and bring the other stuff.</p><p align="left">“Are you okay?” This time it was Agatha.</p><p align="left">Agatha's soft voice. Agatha's presence. </p><p align="left">“Yeah, just a...” Rio paused as she looked at Agatha's face. She didn't know how to response. <em>Was she okay?</em> “Just a headache.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah.”</p><p align="left">Lilia came to join them with a bottle of wine in her hand.</p><p align="left">They sat, and of course Agatha would sit facing her. <em>Of course she would.</em></p><p align="left">“This is so good, Lilia,” Rio said as she took the first bite.</p><p align="left">“Exactly! It's so good.” Agatha said in affirmation.</p><p align="left">They ate while talking about things here and there, Rio felt good here, between these two.</p><p align="left">By the third glass of wine, Rio was drunk.</p><p align="left">Lilia left to do something—Rio didn't really know what it was. She wasn't paying attention.</p><p align="left">“Why are you staring at me?” Rio asked, it was barley above a whisper. </p><p align="left">“I'm not staring at you.” Agatha said in her normal tone that was laced with delight.</p><p align="left">“No, you are. You're staring at me.” Rio insisted, still whispering. </p><p align="left">“And what If I'm really staring at you? Is it a problem?” Agatha replied, matching Rio's whispering tone. She waited for Rio's response with her lips curled up in a smirk.</p><p align="left">“Yes,” Rio spoke after a few seconds.</p><p align="left">Agatha raised an eyebrow at that and <em>that</em> smirk never left her face. “Yeah? And what is it?”</p><p align="left">“It makes me drunk, the way you stare at me... I mean, yeah, this is, um, this is my what? Fifth glass? But—but it's different. It's not the alcohol. I don't think so.” Rio struggled to speak what she was feeling. She leaned back in her chair as she locked eyes with Agatha.</p><p align="left">“You're adorable, do you know that?” </p><p align="left">Oh, Agatha was also drunk.</p><p align="left">“Yes, I know.” Rio grinned and Agatha laughed at that.</p><p align="left">She really was adorable.</p><p align="left">“I like your painting.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? Which one?”</p><p align="left">“The one that makes me feel guilty and sad.”</p><p align="left">“Guilty and sad at the same time? Which one is that?”</p><p align="left">“I don't know, <em>Agatha</em>,”</p><p align="left">Agatha's eyes widened upon hearing her name coming out of Rio's throat for the first time.</p><p align="left">“Tell me which one is it when we're both sober.” She said after a second of silence.</p><p align="left">“Will do, ma'am.”</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled.</p><p align="left">By the time Lilia came back they were wasted. She tried to make Rio stay the night but Rio refused, so Lilia called a cab for her.</p><p align="left">Rio grabbed her jacket and stepped outside. It was a cold, dark night. The moon was clouded as its light illuminated through the dark clouds sailing in front of it in the sky.</p><p align="left">Rio took a deep cold breath as she closed her eyes and clenched her jacket. The inhale almost sobered her up.</p><p align="left">“Hey,” A soft voice from behind made her open her eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio turned around and faced Agatha.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">Their smiles mirrored </p><p align="left">“Give me your phone.”</p><p align="left">Without saying a word, Rio took her phone out and handed it Agatha. </p><p align="left">Their fingers brushed momentarily. </p><p align="left">Agatha wrote her number down, then she gave Rio's phone back. “There, just in case.”</p><p align="left">Rio's smile widened as she kept staring at Agatha's gleaming eyes with her half-lidded ones. Taking in her beautiful face and flushed skin.</p><p align="left">Then Rio got into the cab and went home.</p><p align="left">
<em>In case of what?</em>
</p><p align="left">Was the question she kept asking herself.</p>

<p align="left">Rio stared at the ringing phone. She had called five times already, and it was midnight. The noisy sound disappeared for a few seconds as her phone remained set on the table. She took a deep breath and exhaled through her nose. Rio was furious.</p><p align="left">Only seconds later, her phone rang again, illuminating the dark room and disturbing the peace. Because she always disturbed Rio's peace.</p><p align="left">
<em>6 Missed Calls, 3 New Messages</em>
</p><p align="left">Rio picked her phone up with gritted teeth. “What the fuck do you want?” She said. Her voice was loud. Echoing in the room.</p><p align="left">“Woah, someone's in a bad mood, I see.”</p><p align="left">Rio's blood boiled at the audacity of her ex. How dare she?</p><p align="left">“What are you? A child? Do you know what time it is?”</p><p align="left">“Oh, I know. I'm also aware that you've never been a good sleeper, so I figured you'd be awake.”</p><p align="left">Rio's tongue poked the inside of her cheek in an attempt to not say what had came to her mind. She didn't want to argue with her and waste her time and energy.</p><p align="left">Her left hand clenched into a fist by her side, her knuckles turned white. Rio was sure as hell ready to kill someone with her bare hands.</p><p align="left">“And you didn't take the hint when I didn't respond? What the fuck do you want, anyway?”</p><p align="left">“I need to talk to you.”</p><p align="left">“About what? What is there between you and <em>me</em> that we need to talk about? Nothing, Jane. Absolutely fucking nothing.”</p><p align="left">“Oh come on, Rio. Don't you miss me?”</p><p align="left">“I don't. To the point that If I saw your corpse lying on the street, I'd fucking dance on it.”</p><p align="left">“Come on baby, don't be like that...”</p><p align="left">“I'm not your fucking baby! Don't you ever dare call me that. Ever!”</p><p align="left">“Okay, okay, calm down. Just let me talk to you this once,”</p><p align="left">“I told you, there's nothing between us to talk about.”</p><p align="left">“I know. Just meet me this once—just this time, I want to talk to you.”</p><p align="left">“Say it now, I don't have time for you. What do you want?”</p><p align="left">“I want to see you.”</p><p align="left">“Oh, fuck you.” Rio said and hung up.</p><p align="left">She ran a furious hand through her dark hair. Fustration ran through her entire body with her boiling blood.</p><p align="left">She wetted her lips and stood in her place for a few long seconds, feeling her head throbbing.</p><p align="left">Then Rio drank a glass of water in one swig and went to sit on the couch. Throwing all of her weight on it with a heavy sigh.</p><p align="left">“That fucking bitch.” Rio muttered as her head rested in her hands.</p><p align="left">She always disturbed her peace. Always dragged her and threw her in the mud. Always found a goddamn way to twist a knife in Rio's back. <em>Always</em>.</p><p align="left">And Rio? Rio was a fool because she always let her affect her.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at the time, it was just a few hours until the sun would rise. The evening had gone to waste and she hadn't gotten a single minute of sleep. It felt like she was trapped in a box—one that fit her perfectly, so tightly that she couldn't even stretch her body. And that box would close and open from time to time, but now, it was shut rigidly.</p><p align="left">No light. No oxygen. Nothing.</p><p align="left">She couldn't get out. Something—or rather, <em>someone</em>—was choking her for their own pleasure, releasing her throat whenever they pleased. And Rio just couldn't escape, trapped and suffocated.</p><p align="left">Morning came, and the sun rose. The sound of birds singing—or maybe cursing this damn morning. The cold breeze filled the house, the chatter of people could be heard outside. The world was filled with life and it irritated Rio.</p><p align="left">Her eyes were burning and the headache was tearing her apart. She had tried to sleep on the couch, but her mind hadn't rested for even a second. At that moment, her only wish was to sleep and sleep <em>and fucking</em> sleep. Maybe sleep and never wake up again. She was feeling like shit, and why? For what reason?</p><p align="left">Rio got up from the couch with a sigh—an exhausted and a heavy one—and wearily dragged her feet upstairs.</p><p align="left">She stood in the doorway of her bedroom, looking at the bed. God, it looked so comfortable. She couldn't resist it, so she crashed onto the mattress, burying her face in the pillows with a sigh.</p><p align="left">Another day, another canceled classes.</p><p align="left">She didn't know how many hours had passed when she woke up, confused. She thought she heard a loud knocking at the door so she got up, more irritated than before.</p><p align="left">Rio quickly washed her face, then went downstairs, approaching the front door, she opened it. </p><p align="left">And there she was. Who else would disturb and ruin her night and morning but her? No one. Not a single human being had the audacity to do that other than her.</p><p align="left">“What the fuck are you doing at my door? Are you fucking kidding me? Seriously?”</p><p align="left">“Hello.”</p><p align="left">“Oh fuck off.”</p><p align="left">“Just let me in.”</p><p align="left">“Are you insane? Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you? Do you want me to call the police?”</p><p align="left">“No, Rio, what’s wrong with <em>you</em>?”</p><p align="left">Rio laughed, hard and loud as she shook her head in mock disbelief. </p><p align="left">“What’s wrong with me? <em>What’s wrong with me</em>? Are you joking?” She said, unable to believe the irony of the situation. The nauseating impudence of her.</p><p align="left">“Let me in. I'm freezing.”</p><p align="left">“No, say what you want right here because this is the only chance you get. The only chance that I'm not even willingly giving it to you.”</p><p align="left">“Fine.” Jane paused as she looked at Rio's eyes, then her eyes drifted to look behind Rio. “I'm pregnant.” She said as she clutched her jacket tighter.</p><p align="left">“Yeah? I'm sure it's not mine.” Rio said with a tired, mocking smile. </p><p align="left">“I wish it was.”</p><p align="left">“No, you don't. Cut the crap, Jane, I'm not an idiot.”</p><p align="left">“I do.” Jane stepped forward, closer to Rio. “I want to raise...”</p><p align="left">“Stay right where you are,” Rio said as she lifted her finger up and pointed at her ex–girlfriend. “Don't you dare playing this shit with me, Jane. You want sympathy? Find it elsewhere. I don't have any for you.”</p><p align="left">“Rio. Please. Don't be like this.” Her ex–girlfriend begged as she stepped closer and closer. And with every step she took, Rio felt herself being suffocated.</p><p align="left">Rio only looked at her, gritting her teeth inside her closed mouth.</p><p align="left">Jane leaned closer as she lifted her hand up in an attempt to touch Rio's face.</p><p align="left">“Go fuck yourself.” Rio slammed her hand to the side. “I don't want to see your face in my life ever again. And I mean it.”</p><p align="left">“Your really won't give me another chance?”</p><p align="left">“To do what? Act like a bitch all over again?”</p><p align="left">Her ex–girlfriend didn't say a thing. She just narrowed her eyes and searched Rio's face.</p><p align="left">Rio pointed at her, “You...” she paused as she looked at her with disgust. “Leave me alone.” Then Rio stepped inside the house and slammed the door shut in her ex's face.</p><p align="left">She leaned her back against the door as she felt her heart tightening inside her chest and stomach was twisting. Rio was desperately trying to steady her breaths. She felt as if she was being chocked. A tight hold wrapped around her throat and denying her to breathe.</p><p align="left">“<em>You did well, Rio. You had to do it.</em>” Rio reassured herself through deep inhales and shaking exhales. Counting inside her head to relax her chaotic state.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't glance back at the door to see if her ex–girlfriend was gone or not.</p><p align="left">It didn't matter. </p><p align="left">She went to the kitchen and made herself a cup of black coffee. A mixture of feelings was running through her, creeping inside. Messing with her head. Just yesterday, she was fine—she was great, even—and as if her ex had sensed it so she came like a storm to ruin Rio's day.</p><p align="left">“<em>Pregnant</em>.” Rio muttered, the thought alone made her feel sick. What was her ex expecting? Did she really think Rio was that stupid to the point she thought doing that would work on her?</p><p align="left">Rio took a sip of her coffee. The bitter taste stung her tongue as it ran down her throat—but it did wonders to wake her up and calm her head, even if just for a little while. Even if it was temporary, because everything in her life lately was temporary.</p><hr/><p align="left">Most of the day had passed. The sun began to set, and it was getting darker outside while Rio lazily lay on the couch and wrapping herself in a blanket as she stared at the TV. She wasn't even watching, she just looked.</p><p align="left">She went from one panic attack to another during the day, and in between, she regretted her entire life—every decision she had ever made. But worst of them all, falling in love with that woman and letting her ruin her as if she had been blindfolded the entire time. And willingly, she decided to stay like that.</p><p align="left">Rio forced herself up from the couch after a battle with herself inside her own head—on whether she should get up or rot on that spot. Because even the thought of putting her feet on the floor and walking seemed exhausting. And she wondered, how the hell she was walking without any trouble most of her life if only thinking about it was <em>that</em> draining?</p><p align="left">But she had to get up and get out from here. This house was holding her captive, making her even more miserable than she already was. She had once lived in feigned love, surrounded by these exact same walls. But lately, they've been mocking her—laughing at how stupid she was. Even the walls knew it and witnessed it.</p><p align="left">Rio wore some clothes without putting much thought into it, she was in her casual state now. She couldn't waste her energy on something as simple as dressing up. </p><p align="left">Heading downstairs, she caught sight of the wine bottle resting on the kitchen island. So Rio grabbed it and poured herself a glass, then she stared at it for a few long seconds as she slowly swirled the liquid inside. Staring at its state and its color.</p><p align="left">
<em> A glass filled with wine.</em>
</p><p align="left">Her mind drifted to Agatha handing her a glass filled with wine as she mysteriously looked at Rio with her hypnotizing blue eyes—with mischief and more. <em>So much more</em>.</p><p align="left">And Rio found herself drifting, she closed her eyes as she took a sip of her glass and let out a deep sigh at the taste. Rio licked her lips and inhaled deeply as the dark-haired woman appeared behind her closed eyelids and graced her.</p><p align="left">In many ways and for several reasons, red wine reminded Rio of Agatha. Red wine <em>was</em> Agatha. Agatha's eyes. Agatha's smirk. Agatha's mysteriousness, intensity and creativity. It was Agatha, because in a way, that woman was <em>intoxicating</em>. And Rio—<em>poor Rio</em>—she didn't know what else to do other than to <em>drift</em> and daydream with every sip of wine she took. Swriling the drops inside the warmth of her mouth and rolling her tongue around them. As if she was, for the first time, truly tasting it. But that bottle was empty, and it barley filled the glass she was holding in the first place.</p><p align="left">She was drifting.</p><p align="left">Rio inhaled deeply and the acidic taste of the wine lingered on her tongue as she stared at the glass for a few more seconds. <em>Agatha</em>.</p><p align="left">Why was Agatha in her head?</p><p align="left">Since when did wine remind Rio of someone? Since when did she think about someone she knew absolutely nothing about? Since when did she <em>yearned</em> the way someone looked at her? Or the way someone's presence made her feel? And the strangest thing of them all—why did she think about Agatha to begin with? Why did Rio think about Agatha almost everyday since she first saw her? </p><p align="left">Rio licked her lips as she studied the glass in her hold. Looking at it closely. Observing what it contained as if she had something personal with it.</p><p align="left">Then she poured the rest of her drink into her mouth. Letting the burning sensations take over her senses for a while. To feel something even if it was bitter.</p><p align="left">Rio drove in silence, humming along to the song that was playing from the car stereo. A cigarette rested between her fingers and the smoke was swirling in the atmosphere of the car.</p><p align="left">She had no idea where she was going. Rio was just driving without any plan in her head. She was just trying to reach and any destination that would distract her from herself even if temporarily. </p><p align="left">Fifteen minutes later, she found herself parked outside a nightclub. Rio wasn't a party person not even a night person in general—at least that was the case for the past decade of her life—so to be there, it felt out of place.</p><p align="left">She remembered what she had told Alice days ago: “Out where, Alice? Bars? Clubs? Drinking all night as I try to pour my sadness and suffering into any girl's mouth that would be willing to swallow?”</p><p align="left">And she was there.</p><p align="left">The Irony of it all.</p><p align="left">But at that moment.... <em>At that moment</em>, it felt right.</p><p align="left">It felt right to pour her sadness and suffering into someone's mouth—someone who would be willing to swallow. It was the right time to forget herself for a few hours. To lose it all and regain something in return.</p><p align="left">Maybe it wasn't the best decision. Maybe it was wrong. But it also felt right—it felt right to make someone else swallow her misery. Even for just a few minutes. To empty herself.</p><p align="left">Rio stepped inside and the neon lights welcomed her sight. They were eye-blinding.</p><p align="left">The loud music. The heavy smell of alcohol, sweat, and strong perfumes. There were many people. Swaying and dancing bodies. They were chatting and yelling or doing whatever they were doing.</p><p align="left">Normally, Rio would turn around and go rot in her house like everyday, but in a way, it was already too late for that.</p><p align="left">Half an hour passed, and she was two cocktails in. She was swirling the ice in her glass as she stared at as if she was observing something, that was when a dark–haired woman sat beside her at the bar and her perfume filled Rio's senses. It was admirable.</p><p align="left">“Hey.” The woman greeted. Her voice was soft, yet it was laced with heavy delight. Confidence maybe.</p><p align="left">Rio turned her face to the side at looked at the woman. “Hi,” she said, then she lifted her glass up to her mouth and drank what was left in it.</p><p align="left">“On me,” the woman said with a smile and gleaming eyes as she pushed the cocktail closer to Rio. </p><p align="left">“Thanks.” Rio chuckled awkwardly as she slightly frowned her brow in confusion.</p><p align="left">“What a pretty thing like you is doing her?” The woman said with a low tone laced with anticipation as she moved her hair to the side and let it fall behind her back. She lifted her chin up slightly, showing her neck and giving some spotlight to her cleavage where two of her shirt buttons were undone. “All alone...” she said locked eyes with Rio and started deliberately brushing Rio's wrist with her fingers.</p><p align="left">Rio poked the inside of her cheek with the tip of her tongue as she met the woman's eyes. She didn't respond, but her lips were curled up by the side with a smile.</p><p align="left">“Are you enjoying your time here?” The woman said as she moved her hand up and tucked a strand of Rio's hair behind her ear.</p><p align="left">Rio narrowed her eyes at the woman as she finished her drink with one swig.</p><p align="left">“Not much,” Rio said as she grabbed the woman's wrist and removed her hand off her face. “Not a fan of unnecessary touching.” She got up from her seat. “Excuse me,” then she left.</p><p align="left">As Rio walked away, she thought about going home. This wasn't for her. She knew it was a bad idea. What she thinking? She knew she couldn't do such a thing.</p><p align="left">But she found herself on the dance floor, her hips were swaying and her eyes were wandering around. Searching for nothing. Rio just wanted to feel something, and even that <em>something</em>, she didn't know what it was.</p><p align="left">Rio closed her eyes briefly as she turned her body to the side. She inhaled deeply then she exhaled sharply as her eyes snapped open and looked forward.</p><p align="left">At that moment, with her vision a little blurry, Rio saw her—<em>Agatha</em>—at the back of the crowd with a woman younger than her by her side, they were standing <em>too</em> close to each other. There wasn't any space between their bodies. And Rio saw how Agatha's thumb was stroking the exposed back of the woman as they smiled and looked <em>adoringly</em> at each other with gleaming eyes.</p><p align="left">The sight was agonizing and it made her heart clench inside her chest for no specific reason.</p><p align="left">Rio stood still in the middle of the dancing crowd, looking at Agatha. Watching her.</p><p align="left">The way Agatha's lips curled up in a knowing smirk when that woman whispered something in her ear gave Rio goosebumps. The creeping kind.</p><p align="left">The way Agatha's body swayed with the music as she swirled the drink in her hold while her other hand kept touching the blonde's back and pulled her closer to her... Rio couldn't do anything other than stare. Feeling like an observing creep.</p><p align="left">She hadn't thought of Agatha as someone who went to clubs with a woman by her side or the kind who enjoyed loud music and blinding neon lights.  But then again, what did she even know about Agatha in the first place? Nothing.</p><p align="left">They were strangers to one another, and the way her heart was pounding? That was ridiculous and unasked for.</p><p align="left">“You know nothing about her Rio.” She muttered, scolding herself.</p><p align="left">As she kept looking at Agatha with wide eyes and a dry mouth, Rio imagined Agatha instead of that dark–haired woman at the bar, or... herself by Agatha's side instead of that blonde woman.</p><p align="left">Rio sighed heavily as she dragged her legs. She should've gone home. </p><p align="left">But her eyes lingered. Now that her eyes found Agatha, Rio was unable to look away or to look at anything or anyone. </p><p align="left">Then, as if she sensed the intensity of Rio's gaze, Agatha found her eyes from the distance. And Rio noticed how her eyes widened.</p><p align="left">The lights went out for a brief second, then they came back on. Agatha's eyes were still on her. The smirk on her face disappeared and was replaced by a shocked expression. She was stunned by seeing Rio just as much as Rio was stunned by seeing her.</p><p align="left">When the music stopped, Rio felt Agatha coming closer to her through the crowd. Almost in a hurry, as if she was being pushed from behind or pulled by something in front of her.</p><p align="left">Agatha approached her.</p><p align="left">“<em>Rio</em>,” She said Rio's name with a smile as she leaned closer.</p><p align="left">“Agatha.” Rio swallowed as she put her hands in her pockets. She had no idea what to do with them.</p><p align="left">They looked at each other with gleaming eyes. Searching each other's faces with uncertainty, hoping to find something in each other's features.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in to Rio's ear and Rio felt herself melt down. “Let's get away from here?” Agatha whispered the suggestion, her words were warm on Rio's ear and she couldn't help but close her eyes as a shiver ran down her spine.</p><p align="left">Rio nodded and they walked away from the noise. She was surprised when the blonde woman didn't follow Agatha, but she was relieved at the same time. That was better.</p><p align="left">They sat at the bar and neither of them looked away, as if they were searching each other's eyes for answers. For something to be spoken.</p><p align="left">“What are you doing here?” Rio broke the silence. Her tone was sharper than she intended.</p><p align="left">“You gotta try LA clubs while you're here, right?” Agatha smiled.</p><p align="left">“Yeah, you're right.” Rio said as she reflected Agatha's smile on her face.</p><p align="left">Seconds passed between them. And the silence had began to stretch.</p><p align="left">“What are you doing here...” Agathapaused as she took a sip from her drink. “By your own?”</p><p align="left">“Blowing off some steam.” Rio's eyes drifted from Agatha's eyes, down to her nose, then lower to her lips. She lingered there for a few seconds, until she realized and lifted her drink up to her face to hide the blush of her skin behind the glass.</p><p align="left">“Mmm.” Agatha hummed as she looked at Rio.  Sensing that she was more tired than any other time she had seen her. As if it all was visible on her features—and Rio knew everything was visible on her features.</p><p align="left">“Are you alright?” Agatha asked, trying to sound as casual as she could to avoid scaring Rio off, but there was real concern behind her words. Rio could hear it.</p><p align="left">Agatha licked her lips and Rio looked at them again, then she met her blue eyes and Rio's heart pounded.</p><p align="left">She didn't answer. She didn't even know what to say. Was she alright?</p><p align="left">“You don't have to answer that.” Agatha said, breaking the uncomfortable silence before it had the chance to stretch.</p><p align="left">“No, it's okay. It's just some personal issues.... um, relationship issues.” Rio's eyes kept roaming over Agatha's face. Looking at every possible spot on her face. She was beautiful, her features were striking.</p><p align="left">“So... you're not single?” Agatha's tone sounded a bit disappointed as she moved in her seat.</p><p align="left">“No, no, I am single.” Rio said as she looked at Agatha. Slowly lowering her gaze to take her in—the glittery mini black dress just above her thigh that she was wearing. The black high heels. Her pale skin. The dark red lipstick that made her lips look delicious. Her silver earrings and necklace. Her dark, wild, wavy hair. And her piercing blue eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio stared for a long time. She almost lost herself in Agatha's face and body. She was being pulled into her.</p><p align="left">Rio cleared her throat as she looked to the side for a few seconds, when she looked back at Agatha— Agatha's smirk was even wider. Something wicked was behind it.</p><p align="left">“What about you?” Rio asked.</p><p align="left">“What about me?”</p><p align="left">“Your blonde partner back there.”</p><p align="left">“Oh, she's not my partner.” A sip. “I'm not into blondes.” She said as she leaned closer and licked her lips.</p><p align="left">Rio inhaled deeply and Agatha's scent filled her senses. It made her head spin.</p><p align="left">She, helplessly tried to stay still and act cool, but Rio could feel her heart pounding inside her chest and ringing in her ears.</p><p align="left">The way Agatha was sitting and facing her so casually while she looked devastatingly gorgeous. It was too much to handle.</p><p align="left">The alcohol had finally gotten into Rio's head—and <em>lord</em>, she wanted to kiss those full, covetable lips.</p><p align="left">“I—I noticed that in the women in your paintings. They were all... dark–haired.”</p><p align="left">“Hmm, you noticed?” Agatha said with a low chuckle.</p><p align="left">“Yes I did. I—I've seen your work. Some of your work.”</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't say anything she just looked at Rio with <em>that</em> smirk. And it was driving Rio insane.</p><p align="left">They stayed like that for a few minutes. Just looking at each other, letting silence embrace them as if all the noise that was surrounding them didn't exist.</p><p align="left">“Do you want to get out of here?” Agatha asked as she looked straight into Rio's eyes.</p><p align="left">“To where?”</p><p align="left">“To my studio.”</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her for a few seconds with a smirk, a flushed cheeks and eye gleaming from the alcohol in her system. She leaned in and lowered her voice. “What's in there?” then she pulled back slightly and sipped her drink. Looking at Agatha with a smile visible from behind the glass.</p><p align="left">Agatha tilted her head slightly to the side as she narrowed her eyes.</p><p align="left">“Well, wine, a few paintings and.... me” Agatha finished her sentence with her lips curled from the side with a smirk.</p><p align="left">Rio's eyes were shining in anticipation.</p><p align="left">“Okay.” </p><p align="left">“Yeah?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah.”</p><hr/><p align="left">They drove separately to their destination, and Agatha arrived there first. </p><p align="left">Rio pushed the door open and stepped inside. It was a large, open space, filled with both finished and unfinished paintings, art supplies scattered everywhere, large windows, wooden floors, and white walls. The dim lighting added the perfect touch to the studio's ambience.</p><p align="left">“This is beautiful.”</p><p align="left">“Oh, thank you, it's nothing really but I'm trying to get used to it for now.”</p><p align="left">Rio looked around the place and her eyes landed on the pillows and blanket thrown on the floor.</p><p align="left">“Do you stay here?”</p><p align="left">Agatha seemed to hesitate before answering the question. </p><p align="left">“Not exactly, but I'm trying to not intrude on Lilia, so I stay here some nights. I—I still didn't find the place that I'm looking for.” She said after a few seconds of silence.</p><p align="left">Rio took in the space, looked around and a painting caught her attention—the one Agatha was standing in front of.</p><p align="left">“Let me get the wine.” Agatha said.</p><p align="left">Rio stood in front of it, the painting was only half covered and what she was able to look at made her curious, so without thinking, Rio removed the white sheet and she gasped the moment she saw what she was looking at.</p><p align="left">It was her, her face, her features.</p><p align="left">Rio was in that painting and she couldn't believe her eyes, so she turned around to look at Agatha who was pouring them two glasses of wine.</p><p align="left">“Is...” Rio swallowed. “Is that me?” Rio said as she pointed her finger at the piece.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her then at was behind her. She walked forward as she kept her eyes locked on Rio's until she handed her the glass and stood beside her.</p><p align="left">“Yes.” Agatha nodded as she sipped.</p><p align="left">Rio kept looking at her with a pounding heart. Urging Agatha to continue.</p><p align="left">Agatha sighed “I just... I couldn't get your face out of my head that night, Rio.” she paused as her eyes drifted behind Rio briefly. “That night at the bar. I tried to paint your face out of my memory.” she licked her lips, hesitation obvious in her features as she looked at Rio—who was still looking at Agatha with a flushed face without even blinking, seeking the truth behind why Agatha was painting her.</p><p align="left">“I tried to paint what I remembered. Your face... It just stuck in my head.” </p><p align="left">Rio blinked then she turned her face to look at the painting. “Your memory is really incredible, because this...” she pointed with her finger as she met Agatha's eyes again. “this looks exactly like me,” Rio was stunned as she tried to fathom the situation.</p><p align="left">She steeped closer to the painting. Touching it and brushing it gently. She was feeling it on her fingertips.</p><p align="left">“I'm sorry about it though.”</p><p align="left">“Why? No, Agatha. I like it, a lot.”</p><p align="left">“You do?”</p><p align="left">“Absolutely. It's perfect. But see,” Rio said, pointing at her face then at the painting, “I think my nose is a bit different than that.”</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled. The sound was low and sweet. “You're adorable.” she whispered as she took a step closer to Rio. “Well, I could paint you much better than that if I could... look at you. See you in front of me.”</p><p align="left">Rio exhaled deeply through her nose as she grinned.</p><p align="left">She took a sip from her drink.</p><p align="left">“I'd love to pose for you.” Rio whispered.</p><p align="left">“And I'd love to paint you.” Agatha stepped even closer.</p><p align="left">Their eyes connected. A connection that felt eternal—nothing could disturb or ruin it. It felt sacred.</p><p align="left">Rio was the one who stepped closer to Agatha and closed the inch of space that was remaining between them.</p><p align="left">Their faces were only a few breaths apart. Agatha's scent filled Rio's senses and flooded her with every inhale she took.</p><p align="left">Their eyes were searching each other's faces with longing and yearning.</p><p align="left">Agatha reached for Rio's cheek, stroking it gently with her thumb, as if she couldn't believe the woman that was standing in front of her.</p><p align="left">Rio's eyes kept drifting between Agatha's delicious lips and her hypnotizing eyes—those piercing blue eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio leaned into the touch and closed her eyes briefly. A shiver ran down her spine at the sensations. She felt herself floating.</p><p align="left">She opened her eyes again to see Agatha's face closer to hers. Noticing how Agatha was leaning slightly every second. </p><p align="left">Their faces were flushed and their eyes were half-lidded and looking with anticipation. Their chests were heavily rising and falling and their breaths were unsteady. Their hearts were rapidly pounding as they leaned <em>even closer</em>—sharing the same air.</p><p align="left">“<em>Kiss me</em>,” Rio whispered. She was intoxicated and her voice was barely audible.</p><p align="left">Agatha was heavily breathing as she took Rio's glass from her hold and put the glasses on the nearest, available surface.</p><p align="left">Without wasting another second, Agatha's lips crashed into Rio's and kissed her with intensity, as if she had been waiting for Rio for decades.</p><p align="left">Rio closed her eyes as she felt Agatha's mouth consume her entirely. Devouring her. She allowed herself to lost in the sensations as her thumb kept stroking Agatha's cheekbone. Tender but urgent.</p><p align="left">The taste of Agatha was arousing as Rio tasted it. It was sweet and sent shivers down Rio's spine and made her body quiver.</p><p align="left">She could feel the heat radiating from Agatha's body, and her own. It was only increasing.</p><p align="left">She felt Agatha's tongue moving on her lips so Rio parted her lips to let Agatha's tongue slide in.</p><p align="left">Agatha's hand abandoned Rio's face and rested on the back of her neck, urging her closer—as if it was possible to consume her even more. Their tongues tangled inside Rio's mouth, Agatha tilted her head slightly and took Rio's tongue in her mouth entirely, sucking it with hunger and lust. The taste of wine and something elseb it was making Rio's head dizzy. Her body numbed and had begun to lose control, her hand found Agatha's hip and rested there—depending on it to keep her in place.</p><p align="left">Agatha was devouring Rio at that point. Eating her mouth out of her face. The intensity of it all—the way Agatha was pouring herself entirely into Rio's mouth, it was overwhelming in the most delicious way ever.</p><p align="left">Rio's body was burning, soon to turn into ashes. Desire was scorching as it run through every part of her. Rio tightened her hold on Agatha's hips and pulled her closer. With the force of how she did so, Agatha took a few steps forward causing Rio to take few backward. Her back hit something with a thud and she moaned heavily into Agatha's mouth. The sound vibrated between them and Agatha whimpered as she slid her leg between Rio's. </p><p align="left">Rio felt herself melting in Agatha's hold, and in the middle of it all Agatha immediately pulled backas she removed her hand from Rio's neck and took a step backward causing Rio to take her hands off her hips.</p><p align="left">They were panting. Their chest heavily rose and fell as they tried getting air inside their lungs.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at Agatha as she put her hands behind her in an attempt to hold on something to keep her standing on her feet.</p><p align="left">“God, I'm sorry.” Agatha breathlessly said as she ran a hand through her hair and locked eyes with Rio.</p><p align="left">Rio frowned her brow in confusion as she took a step toward Agatha while she was still trying to breathe.</p><p align="left">“For what?” Rio met Agatha's half-lidded eyes.</p><p align="left">“I'm sorry, for... <em>this</em>.” She moved her hand fingers slowly on her bottom lip. “I lost myself, Rio.” Agatha swallowed.</p><p align="left">“Why are you apologizing?” Rio's voice rose. Frustration and bewilderment flickering across her face.</p><p align="left">Agatha inhaled deeply as she ran both of her hands in her hair.</p><p align="left">“We're both drunk, Rio.”</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">“I'm sorry, you... <em>God</em>, you should leave. We will—we'll talk about this. I'll see you later.”</p><p align="left">Rio's jaw stiffened as she stood straight and looked at Agatha's face.</p><p align="left">She stayed silent for a few long, awkward seconds.</p><p align="left">“Oh. Okay, cool.”</p><p align="left">With that, Rio headed out with hurried steps and left.</p><p align="left">Hot, fast tears fell down her face the moment the door was shut behind her. Her vision was blurry and her heart was pounding against her ribcage.</p>

<p align="left">Rio left Agatha's studio in a hurry and got into her car as tears fell down her face. Fast, scorching and scolding.</p><p align="left">She was driving as fast as she could despite her drunken state and blurred vision.</p><p align="left">She almost got into an accident because of her reckless driving—or maybe, Rio wanted to get into an accident, because no physical pain could overpower what she was feeling. She was feeling sick in her skin, rotten. The weight of everything had finally caught up to her and it was so heavy to lift. It was nauseating, the way nothing had ever worked out for her. Even what she wanted.</p><p align="left">Rio just wanted to reach home. That depressing place was where she wanted to be at that moment, it was her only destination. At least there, she could rot and hate her existence in peace, without being seen.</p><p align="left">She lost her way. Her mind was too occupied to think about the right route home. She looked around, reading the signs with narrowed eyes and blurred vision, but she wasn't even able to focus properly. Words were floating in front of her without making any sense.</p><p align="left">Her phone lit up several times beside her as time passed without knowing how she could reach her destination.</p><p align="left">Her breaths were heavy and uneven. Her heart was racing. Her head was throbbing. Rio felt weak.</p><p align="left">She parked in the closest parking lot she could find. She gasped for air as she wiped her face with her hands and grabbed her phone. Her fingers were shaking as they hovered over the screen, trying to enter the password correctly but she failed to do so three times.</p><p align="left">Until Lilia called her again and Rio swiped to respond.</p><p align="left">“Rio, dear, where are you? Are you alright?”</p><p align="left">Rio sucked in a sob.</p><p align="left">“Yeah, yeah I'm—I'm fine. I'm out, on my way home. Do you... Did you want anything?”</p><p align="left">She said as she ran a shaking hand through her hair. She sounded drunk.</p><p align="left">“Honey, look... Agatha told me you're drunk and driving. Tell me where you are, I'll come and get you.”</p><p align="left">Rio cried at the mention of Agatha. She covered the phone's speaker as she desperately tried to collect herself. She shouldn't cry at the mention of the woman.</p><p align="left">“Rio? Hello? Where are you?”</p><p align="left">“I'm here. Look... I'm fine Lilia, I really am. Don't worry.”</p><p align="left">She gasped for air with every word she said. Her tears were falling down, her sobs were escaping her throat, she couldn't hold them inside any longer even if she wanted to.</p><p align="left">“Just tell me where you are, I'll come and get you, Rio. Just tell me. I'm on my way to Agatha's studio, are you close to there?”</p><p align="left">“I don't know where I am.” Rio closed her eyes as she placed her hand above her heart and pushed on her chest with her palm.</p><p align="left">“Look around you dear. Turn on your GPS. Tell me anything you can see.”</p><p align="left">“I can't, Lilia. I can't. I swear, I just can't do this. I can't see anything. Everything is blurry.”</p><p align="left">And there, she lost it all. </p><p align="left">Rio was suffocating. She wanted to scream. To rip her heart off her chest. To black out. She just wanted everything to stop, she couldn't handle what she was feeling. It was too much.</p><p align="left">“<em>Rio...</em>”</p><p align="left">That wasn't Lilia. It was Agatha.</p><p align="left">And the hold on Rio's throat tightened.</p><p align="left">“Rio? Hey, do you hear me? Talk to me, yeah? I'm here, just tell me where you are.”</p><p align="left">Rio cried. Her eyes were burning and she leaned her head on the steering wheel as she clutched the phone closer to her ear. Listening to Agatha's soft voice that was laced with concern and it made everything worse on Rio. </p><p align="left">“<em>Agatha... Agatha... Agatha...</em>”</p><p align="left">Rio finally opened her mouth to say something, but she ended up with whispering the woman's name with a shaking breath. </p><p align="left">“I'm here.” Agatha whispered and Rio felt her tears running faster than before.</p><p align="left">She inhaled a deep breath that got stuck in her throat. “I'm not mad at you, you know? Really. So... excuse me, <em>m’lady</em>—I'm gonna hang up.”</p><p align="left">And that Rio did.</p><p align="left">Truth be told, she wasn't mad at Agatha. How could she be? But the fact that her life had been <em>so</em> awful lately. The way nothing seemed to work out no matter what it was. It all was heavy on Rio's shoulders to hold.</p><p align="left">She couldn't even pour her goddamn misery into somebody else's glass. </p><p align="left">Her phone rang several times in her hand as she clutched it tightly in her sweating hold. Her tears were burning on her skin.</p><p align="left">It was midnight. Rio looked around one more time, trying to figure out where the hell she was.</p><p align="left">Then called Alice, the phone rang for a few seconds before her friend picked up.</p><p align="left">“Hello?” She sounded half–asleep.</p><p align="left">“Sorry, Alice, did I wake you?”</p><p align="left">“Rio? No, no. What's up?”</p><p align="left">“Can you come and get me?”</p><p align="left">“Why? Where are you?”</p><p align="left">“Please, just come and get me.”</p><hr/><p align="left">Rio stayed inside the car. The parking lot was empty. She leaned her head against the steering wheel, feeling her heart pounding faster than ever. A throbbing sensation grew in her head, a second heartbeat pulsing in her skull and she couldn't do anything about it.</p><p align="left">She had to get out twice to vomit her soul out, the nausea in her stomach faded for a few seconds, only to return stronger and more acidic than before.</p><p align="left">Half an hour later, Alice arrived there with Jen. Rio was aware that she had disturbed their peace and she made a mental note to apologize about it later.</p><p align="left">“Hey, hey, I've got you.” Alice said as she gently helped Rio get into the passenger seat of her own car so she could drive them both home.</p><p align="left">Jen followed behind in Alice's car.</p><p align="left">Before they got to Alice's house, Rio recognized it.</p><p align="left">“No, take me home.”</p><p align="left">“I know, I know. I'll take you there in the morning. You need to rest, Rio.”</p><p align="left">Rio didn't have the energy to argue, so she just accepted it.</p><p align="left">Alice took her to the guest room and Rio immediately crashed onto the bed. Her friend helped her out of her jacket and shoes while Rio mumbled an exhausted <em>Thank you.</em></p><p align="left">“Rest now.”</p><p align="left">That was the last thing Rio heard before her heavy, burning eyes closed.</p><p align="left">She slept most of the day and only woke up when she heard Alice softly calling her name.</p><p align="left">Thank God it was Saturday. </p><p align="left">Rio opened her eyes as she gradually started realizing where she was, and who was standing next to her and feeling her forehead with her hand.</p><p align="left">“Hey,” Alice said with that sweet smile of hers—the one that sparked and brightened everything around her.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her for a few seconds, trying to piece together last night's events and why she was here.</p><p align="left">“God...” Rio sighed heavily before she sat and leaned her back against the headboard. Her body ached, and her head was throbbing. The headache was the worst kind—the kind where she could feel it from her shoulder blades up to her skull and every nerve in her head pulsed. “Alice, I'm really sorry.”</p><p align="left">“Don't apologize Rio. Go wash up and come eat with us.”</p><p align="left">And she did. Rio washed her face and went to the dining room, where Alice and Jen were already seated.</p><p align="left">She looked at them with guilt in her eyes.</p><p align="left">“Guys, I'm really sorry about last night, I didn't mean to—”</p><p align="left">“Rio, just get your ass in here. We'll talk about this later.”</p><p align="left">She couldn't eat. Her mind was crowded with thoughts and memories, which turned into a nauseating sensation that settled in her stomach.</p><p align="left">“Why aren't you eating?” Alice asked.</p><p align="left">Rio looked up at her. “I'm not really hungry.”</p><p align="left">“Rio..”</p><p align="left">“I'm not hungry, Alice,” She said, trying to keep her voice low.</p><p align="left">“Okay. How are you feeling?”</p><p align="left">“Good, I guess. I just need some coffee.”</p><p align="left">Rio noticed the way Alice and Jen exchanged a concerned glance. And she hated it.</p><p align="left">“Okay, I'll make you some coffee.”</p><p align="left">“No, it's okay Alice. Seriously, I'm fine, I can make my own coffee.”</p><p align="left">“Alright, Rio.”</p><p align="left">She got up as she took her full plate with her.</p><p align="left">Rio just wanted to go home.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Do you want to talk about last night?” Alice asked, sitting on the couch, facing Rio.</p><p align="left">“Yes,” Rio said, clapping her hands against her thighs. “I'm sorry about last night.”</p><p align="left">“God, Rio, not this. Don't apologize.”</p><p align="left">“I have to.” Rio looked at Alice. “Where is Jen?”</p><p align="left">“She's working upstairs.”</p><p align="left">“Oh. Okay.”</p><p align="left">“Rio... I don't want to push you. You know I don't want to put pressure on you. I don't want you to get hurt, Rio. You know that I love you and I'd do anything to you. But... God, Rio. When I saw you last night? I almost didn't recognize you. What happened?”</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her friend, unsure how to respond. She always hated looking vulnerable—it embarrassed her. For a long time she had balanced everything, allowing herself to be vulnerable only when she was alone. Moments like these always caught her off guard, and she knew she had to answer at some point. Because it was Alice, it wasn't some stranger who knew nothing about her. Alice was the only person who really knew Rio.</p><p align="left">“I don't know Alice. I just lost myself, that's all.”</p><p align="left">“Do you know you were saying Agatha's name the whole time on the way home? And you told me you wanted to see her.”</p><p align="left">Rio looked at Alice and her heart tightened in her chest. Did she really do that?</p><p align="left">“Did she do something to you? Did she hurt you?”</p><p align="left">“No, no. She... I was just stupid, Alice. I drank too much last night. I lost my mind and acted like a fucking teenager, that's all. She has nothing to do with this. It was me.”</p><p align="left">“Are you sure? I'll talk to Lilia if she did something to you.”</p><p align="left">“No. No, Alice. I can handle myself.”</p><p align="left">“Rio,”</p><p align="left">“What?”</p><p align="left">“You don't have to...”</p><p align="left">“Please don't say the rest of that.”</p><p align="left">“Okay. Okay, I won't. Just take care of yourself. Please.”</p><p align="left">“I will. Don't worry about me.”</p><p align="left">“Call me, if you need anything.”</p><p align="left">“I will. And... I'm sorry about last night, Alice. Tell Jen that I'm really sorry.”</p><hr/><p align="left">Rii got home. The moment she stepped inside, the familiar atmosphere wrapped around her.</p><p align="left">She crashed onto the couch immediately. Letting the piece of furniture take her heavy weight.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her phone, reading that same message over and over again.</p><p align="left">An unknown number, but she knew who it was.</p><p align="left">
<em>Hi, Rio, did you arrive home yesterday? Are you alright?</em>
</p><p align="left">Agatha had sent it hours ago ans Rio stared at it for a long time. Thinking of a response, then the three dots appeared—then disappeared. Twice. </p><p align="left">
<em>Yes, I'm home now. Thank you for your concern.</em>
</p><p align="left">Formal, but it will do.</p><p align="left">How was she supposed talk to Agatha anyway? As a friend? A stranger? Or as someone who had kissed her senseless the night before, only to send her away because she <em>lost herself</em>?</p><p align="left">
<em>Can I call you?</em>
</p><p align="left">Rio stared at the message longer than necessary.</p><p align="left">Can Agatha call her? Yes or no?</p><p align="left">
<em>Was it really that simple? Yes or no?</em>
</p><p align="left">What would they even talk about?</p><p align="left">But oh god, Rio wanted to hear her voice—that sweet, soft voice. She wanted to hear what Agatha had to say. </p><p align="left">She <em>needed</em> to listen to her.</p><p align="left">
<em>Yes. It's okay, I don't mind.</em>
</p><p align="left">Only seconds later, her phone rang.</p><p align="left">“Hi, Rio.” Agatha greeted.</p><p align="left">Rio sensed something in her voice. It was lower, almost a whisper, like she was afraid of revealing what her voice <em>really</em> sounded like.</p><p align="left">But her voice was enough to make Rio sit up straight.</p><p align="left">“Hi.”</p><p align="left">An uncomfortable silence stretched between them. Rio could hear Agatha breathing—her breaths uneven. She waited for Agatha to say something. Anything. The silence was killing her.</p><p align="left">“Are you okay, Agatha?” Rio found herself asking. She was worried about Agatha—a woman she knew nothing about—yet, she could feel her. She could feel her hesitation. Could picture the look in Agatha's eyes at that moment. She could feel Agatha running through her veins and it was a strange, unreasonable sensation. Or maybe it was just the hangover.</p><p align="left">“I'm fine, are you?” Agatha's voice was deeper now.</p><p align="left">Rio thought about the question. Something inside  urged her to tell Agatha everything. To talk to her for hours and hours, but she couldn't, she just couldn't do that.</p><p align="left">“I'm better now. I mean... yes, I'm good. Don't worry.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh, Rio...</em>” </p><p align="left">Agatha sighed her name, and a shiver ran down Rio's spine as the hairs on her body stood to their end. She found herself unable to coherent words. Hearing her name laced with exhaustion, wrapped in a sigh, and out of Agatha's mouth did something to her—it sent her heart racing. </p><p align="left">She placed a hand on her chest. She had felt this kind of heartbeat before—during panic attacks—but she wasn't panicking. Rio was melting, becoming one with the couch beneath her.</p><p align="left">“What is it? Goddamn it” Rio muttered to herself, pressing her hand harder against her chest.</p><p align="left">She wanted to say something to Agatha. Anything.</p><p align="left">“I like the way you say my name.”</p><p align="left">No. Goddamn it. That wasn't it.</p><p align="left">Rio smacked her forehead. It was too late.</p><p align="left">“I like how it sounds in my mouth. I like your name, <em>Rio</em>.” Agatha said, breathing through every word.</p><p align="left">
<em>Her mouth...</em>
</p><p align="left">Rio had tasted her mouth yesterday. How sweet it was—the way Agatha's lips had taken hers on a journey she wouldn't forget no matter what. The way Agatha kissed her with heat and hunger. She devoured her, left her breathless and speechless.</p><p align="left">Rio desperately wanted that mouth on hers again.</p><p align="left">The memory of the kiss flooded her and made her mouth water.</p><p align="left">“Rio, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have let you leave like that yesterday.” Agatha broke the silence.</p><p align="left">“It's—it's okay, Agatha.”</p><p align="left">“No it's not. Please, just let me finish.” Agatha's tone was firm but it was still soft and concerned. </p><p align="left">She sighed heavily. “I'm sorry for being such a dick. You didn't deserve that. I hope I can make it up to you.”</p><p align="left">“Agatha, it's really okay. I appreciate it, but look—it wasn't your fault. I kinda of rushed into it.” Rio paused for a moment, “I just haven't been myself lately, so... it has nothing to do with you.” She said as she ran a hand through her hair.</p><p align="left">Neither of them spoke for a while, just listening to each other breathing. As if they were afraid of saying something. Of stepping inside. Of trespassing on each other's space.</p><p align="left">Sitting in silence, knowing Agatha was on the other end of the line gave Rio a strange sense of safety—of presence. Just the thought that Agatha was actually there, made her heartbeat slow in a way she hadn't experienced before.</p><p align="left">“I'd like to see you. I <em>want</em> to see you,” Agatha finally said, after what felt like an eternity.</p><p align="left">“I'd like to see you too,” Rio responded immediately, without thinking much about it. Her heart pounded faster, sending a delightful sensation through her—one she hadn't felt in ages.</p><hr/><p align="left">Rio was nervous. She shouldn't have agreed to see Agatha.</p><p align="left">Seeing her after last night, after that kiss...</p><p align="left">And God, her memory had never been kind to her, because now she remembered the nonsense she had mumbled in the car—whispering Agatha's name like a mantra through the phone.</p><p align="left">Was she that teenager in <em>Call Me By Your Name</em>?</p><p align="left">Why was she acting like a lovesick girl with a forbidden crush that will lead to a doomed, known fate?</p><p align="left">She needed to pull herself together. She was a grown woman for god's sake.</p><p align="left">Rio has kissed women before, plenty of them— whether she was drunk or sober, mourning or rejoicing.</p><p align="left">But none of them had felt like Agatha. No pair of lips had tasted like hers—that heated, drunken kiss that lasted for... <em>God</em>, she didn't even know how long it even lasted. But it felt like eternity. It made her feel alive in a way she couldn't comprehend.</p><p align="left">Everytime her mind drifted back to the memory of last night, an electric wave swept through her entire body. </p><p align="left">She stared at her wardrobe for a long time, trying to pick something that felt right—something that wasn't too much, but not too little.</p><p align="left">She settled on a white button–down blouse with a slightly open neckline, a gray jacket, and a high–waisted gray trousers with a black belt that had a golden buckle. Gold hoop earrings. And that necklace.</p><p align="left">She stared at her reflection in the full length mirror <em>that will do, </em>she told herself.</p><p align="left">Rio drove to the place where she was supposed to meet Agatha. She parked her car and stayed in it for a while, preparing herself to see Agatha again—to meet her eyes.</p><p align="left">Once she got inside, she couldn't see Agatha anywhere, thinking she must have arrived early. </p><p align="left">She looked around, searching for the woman.</p><p align="left">“Do you have a reservation, ma'am?” </p><p align="left">Rio looked at the man, she was about to answer with a <em>no</em> and leave,</p><p align="left">“Yes, Agatha Harkness,” a voice from behind her said. “Sorry for making you wait.”</p><p align="left">Rio turned to look at her, and there was a smile on Agatha's face—one she hadn't seen before. It was stripped of all the usual teasing and intensity. It was... beautiful to look at. To feel.</p><p align="left">Rio kept looking at Agatha as she smiled in return. Mirroring her.</p><p align="left">An oversized beige suit, a high–necked top, golden necklace and earrings—she looked gorgeous. <em>Ethereal</em>.</p><p align="left">They held each other's gaze for a moment before Agatha led them toward their table. As they walked, Agatha's hand briefly rested on Rio's waist before she pulled it away. Rio noticed the rush in the way Agatha had pulled her hand, she looked at her, but Agatha didn't look back.</p><p align="left">They sat, facing each other. Their eyes spoke volumes while their tongues remained tied. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“You look beautiful,” Agatha said before taking a sip of wine.</p><p align="left">“Thank you.” Rio felt herself blusing, something that did not go unnoticed by Agatha.</p><p align="left">“You look beautiful. Like, really beautiful.” Rio said as their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">“Thank you, Rio.”</p><p align="left">They spent the evening talking about themselves. Sharing fragments of their lives but nothing too personal. Nothing deep.</p><p align="left">Rio felt safe in Agatha's presence, as if she were embraced—even though Agatha hadn't touched her at all.</p><p align="left">“Okay, now I'll ask you a question that you have to answer and you'll ask me something in return,” Rio said, grinning widely. “Deal?”</p><p align="left">Agatha hesitated for a brief second. “Deal.”</p><p align="left">“What's that painting about?” Rio asked, watching Agatha's face, her features were so calming to look at. “<em>Black: My True Love's Heart.</em>”</p><p align="left">Agatha stopped in the middle of taking a sip from her glass as soon as she heard the title of the painting Rio was asking about. And just as Lilia had said, her expressions changed into something unreadable—something Rio hadn't seen before. Something she couldn't read.</p><p align="left">Agatha set her glass down as she looked at Rio's face, searching for something there. She remained silent for a while, and Rio waited eagerly.</p><p align="left">“That painting is... personal,” Agatha said, pausing to drink what was left in her glass. “I painted it in college. I was a mess back then. Didn't know what I was doing or why.” She was looking at Rio then her eyes drifted away, staring at the empty glass in front of her. “I had issues back then—all kinds—but mostly with my... ah, my mother. I stayed the worst version of myself for years because of her. I never knew what I should do. I always aimed to please her because I thought I'd be worth something if I could change her opinion about me—the way she saw me. But it didn't work out. Unfortunately or fortunately... honestly, I don't know.” She let out a chuckle, laced with awkwardness.</p><p align="left">Rio's eyes remained locked on her as breathed slowly, listening to every word that left Agatha's mouth.</p><p align="left">“She always said I had a black heart—unloveable, worthless—a sack of shit if you will. That the only person who could ever love me was someone with a heart to match mine—<em>a black one</em>. So, the painting... I don't really know how to talk about it. I—I never thought I'd talk about it to anyone.”</p><p align="left">Then, she looked into Rio's eyes as if something in them encouraged her to keep talking, she resumed.</p><p align="left">“I never even finished it. I was an addict at the time, a complete mess—whatever you want to call it, really. Half of the time I wasn't even aware I was painting it. So, ah... yeah. A few months after that, my mother committed suicide, leaving nothing behind but her will and a letter describing how <em>I</em> made her life a living hell.”</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled again, and Rio looked at her—an<em> I am sorry</em> resting on the tip of her tongue.</p><p align="left">“Yeah. So, I completed the painting after her death. I felt guilty, yes, but after she was gone, I was free—like I was breathing for the first time. I don't know if that makes me sound like a horrible person.” An awkward laugh followed that as Agatha refilled their glasses. “So, you could say the first half of the painting was me being held captive in a nonexistent cage, and the other half... me being free, searching for who I really am.” Agatha's eyes locked onto Rio's again.</p><p align="left">When Rio realized Agatha had finished speaking, she placed her hand over Agatha's. “I'm sorry,” she said, gently stroking Agatha's knuckle with her thumb.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked down at their hands, then back into Rio's eyes.</p><p align="left">“It's okay. It was a long time ago. Sorry for trauma–dumping and ruining the night.” Agatha laughed.</p><p align="left">“No, you didn't ruin the night,” Rio said softly, continuing to brush Agatha's hand gently. “I want to hear everything and anything about you, Agatha.”</p><p align="left">Agatha's eyes widened slightly. She remained silent for a few seconds before tilting her head to the side with a smile.</p><p align="left">“Is it the painting that makes you feel <em>guilty and sad </em>when you look at it?” She asked, smirking with amusement.</p><p align="left">“Did I really say guilty and sad?” </p><p align="left">“Yes, you did.” Agatha said, still smirking.</p><p align="left">“Well, my choice of words was awful. But in my defense, I was drunk.” Rio smiled. “It makes me feel much more than that, everytime I look at it. At some point, I started avoiding Alice's office just so I wouldn't have to see it and get flooded with emotions.”</p><p align="left">“Alice has it?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, she does.”</p><p align="left">And Agatha hummed in response.</p><p align="left">“But I like it so much,” Rio admitted as she absentmindedly rolled Agatha's thumb ring. It felt natural—until she realized what she was doing and quickly pulled her hand away.</p><p align="left">“My turn,” Agatha said. She was silent for a few seconds, only searching Rio's eyes with hers.</p><p align="left">She inhaled deeply. “How are you, Rio?”</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">“How do you mean?”</p><p align="left">“How are you, Rio?” Agatha repeated the same question, but this time, her tone was softer than Rio had ever heard. She wanted to tell Agatha to change the question, to ask something else. But she didn't. She couldn't.</p><p align="left">“I don't know.” </p><p align="left">“You don't know?” Agatha leaned closer in her seat as she put both of her hands on the table.</p><p align="left">“I honestly don't know.” Rio admitted sincerely.</p><p align="left">“Okay.” Agatha smiled softly.</p><p align="left">Rio was shocked. She had expected her to push for an answer, to dig deeper. But Agatha didn't. And somehow, that—<em>exactly that</em>—made Rio open her mouth again and speak.</p><p align="left">“I mean... what would you do if your ex–girlfriend showed up at your house to tell you that she's pregnant and kind of want to raise the kid with you?”</p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her, absolutely stunned. She raised her brow, “What?” she said, her tone was laced with disbelief.</p><p align="left">“Yes, she did that. Yesterday.”</p><p align="left">“Yesterday? Is that why you were at the club?”</p><p align="left">“Yes.”</p><p align="left">“God, I'm sorry, Rio.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, she's a bitch.”</p><p align="left">“She sounds like one.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah. I mean, she cheated on me with a dude and then made it seem like I was the <em>monster</em> somehow.”</p><p align="left">“I'm sorry, Rio.” Agatha said, her tone had changed. It was sincere and concerned. </p><p align="left">“No, it's okay. Really.”</p><p align="left">“No. You were already having a bad day, and I only made it worse.”</p><p align="left">“How could you have known? You didn't know, Agatha. And also, you've apologized enough already.”</p><p align="left">This time, Agatha took Rio's hand in hers and squeezed it gently—an unspoken <em>I'm sorry</em>.</p><p align="left">They remained silent, looking at each other. Memorizing every feature. Savoring every detail. And saving second of their presences.</p><p align="left">“I like your nose.” Rio said out of nowhere.</p><p align="left">“You like what?” Agatha chuckled.</p><p align="left">“Your nose. I like it.”</p><p align="left">“Well... Thank you.” Agatha blushed.</p><p align="left">“It's really beautiful. I want to touch it.”</p><p align="left">“What?”</p><p align="left">“May I touch it?”</p><p align="left">“Rio...”</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her with the best puppy–dog eyes she could muster.</p><p align="left">“You—okay, you can touch it.” Agatha licked her lips as she leaned in slightly. Rio did the same as she grinned. Not caring where they were or who might be watching.</p><p align="left">Their eyes met.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted a finger up and touched Agatha's lips first. Agatha's breath hitched and her lips instinctively parted slightly.</p><p align="left">“That's not my nose, Rio.” Agatha was breathless.</p><p align="left">“I know.” Rio smiled. “But you wouldn't have let me touch them if I had said I wanted to.”</p><p align="left">Her index finger trailed higher, sliding from the bridge of Agatha's nose down to the tip.</p><p align="left">“I would,” Agatha mumured.</p><p align="left">“What?” Rio said, her eyes flickering between Agatha's lips and her eyes. </p><p align="left">“I would've let you touch them if you had asked.” </p><p align="left">Rio fell silent, she hadn't expected that.</p><p align="left">She just looked at Agatha's lips. Then back into her eyes, repeatedly.</p><p align="left">And Agatha just looked at her as she let her do what she wanted.</p><p align="left">Their evening came to an end as they stepped out of the restaurant. The night breeze embraced them both.</p><p align="left">“Thank you for tonight,” Rio said.</p><p align="left">“Thanks to you.”</p><p align="left">They stood there for a while as if neither of them wanted to leave.</p><p align="left">“Do you want to... um, come to my place?” Rio asked, fidgeting with an imaginary thread on her jacket. </p><p align="left">Agatha pulled her blazer tighter on her body and looked at Rio with gleaming eyes.</p><p align="left">“Okay.”</p><hr/><p align="left">They drove separately to Rio's place, arriving at the same time.</p><p align="left">Rio unlocked the door, stepped inside and Agatha followed her.</p><p align="left">The place was completely dark, so Rio hurried to turn the lights on. </p><p align="left">“Do you want something to drink?”</p><p align="left">“Yes, anything would be fine.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, make yourself comfortable.”</p><p align="left">Agatha just walked to the couch and sat down, wandering around with her eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio returned with two glasses of red wine and the bottle in her other hand.</p><p align="left">“I like your garden,” Agatha said as she took a glass from Rio's hold and said a soft “<em>Thank you.</em>”</p><p align="left">“Thank you.” Rio grinned as she sat beside Agatha, leaving a small gap between them.</p><p align="left">They talked about work and other things, as if trying to distract themselves from the fact that they were sitting beside each other—denying the weight of the situation as if that would change the fact that it was heavy.</p><p align="left">Then, Rio had just enough wine to summon the courage to ask.</p><p align="left">“May I touch your lips now?”</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled and nodded as she licked her lips.</p><p align="left">Rio leaned in, only a few inches between them. She raised her index finger and traced Agatha's lower lip and Agatha's lips parted instantly. Her breath hitched and her pupils dilated, blown widely.</p><p align="left">Rio brushed her bottom lip, then the upper one, noticing how Agatha was holding her breath because of how close they were.</p><p align="left">“Can I kiss you now?” Rio whispered, still tracing her finger over Agatha's lips left and right.</p><p align="left">“You better do.” Agatha sighed as she cupped Rio's face and pulled her closer. Their warm breaths mingled. The closeness made Rio's mouth water as heat spread through her body.</p><p align="left">Rio's lips crashed against Agatha's and they both moaned at the first taste of each other—a taste Rio could already see herself becoming addicted to.</p><p align="left">The kiss started slow and soft, but within seconds, it turned hungry, filled with lust and untamed fire. Agatha bit Rio's bottom lip, and Rio moaned in response and parted her lips slightly. Agatha didn't waste a moment, her tongue slipped into Rio's mouth and the kiss deepened. It was intense and hot, and Rio could feel the desire surging through her veins.</p><p align="left">Agatha's hands left Rio's cheeks, settling firmly on her hips. She pulled Rio closer and closer, until Rio was practically sitting in her lap. They didn't break the kiss for a second; it only grew more feverish, more desperate. Agatha's fingers traced patterns over the fabric of Rio's clothes while Rio's hands clung to Agatha's shoulders. </p><p align="left">Only seconds later, when oxygen became a necessity, they pulled back slightly and broke the kiss. Their faces remained a heavy breath apart. They were breathless. Their chest rising and falling. Their breaths heavy. Their eyes blown widely and their skin flushed. Agatha cupped Rio's face again and pressed a kiss to her forehead.</p><p align="left">“You're so beautiful. Do you know that?” Agatha mumured then she leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to Rio's forehead again.</p><p align="left">Rio only smiled and blushed in response as she tried to catch her breath.</p><p align="left">She settled back onto the couch and was already missing Agatha's mouth on hers. Agatha's hands on her body. </p><p align="left">“I'll be out of town for a few days,” Agatha said. “There's an art gallery I need to attend.” She paused, looking at Rio. “You can call me.”</p><p align="left">“I will.”</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in again, kissing Rio softly before she brushed their noses together.</p><p align="left">“I should go now.”</p><p align="left">Rio didn't protest she just leaned forward and kissed Agatha in response.</p><p align="left">They hugged at the door, holding on for a moment longer. And then Agatha left.</p><p align="left">“Take care.” Rio whispered—long after Agatha was gone.</p>

<p><em>You’ll never learn to lie, say your French goodbye</em><br/><em>Stay up in the blue glow, try to rearrange</em><br/><em>All your insecurity and encyclopaedic rage</em><br/><em>Do you still think you’re a killer,</em><br/><em>O</em> <em>r that you could be if you tried?</em><br/><em>Always thought that you could do it if you couldn’t see their eyes</em></p><p>
<br/>
<em>Do you still wake up reaching for an empty space?</em>
<br/>
<em>Do you start to miss your sadness when it goes away?</em>
<br/>
<em>Do you wish your parents gave you someone else’s name?</em>
<br/>
<em>Do you scratch another line out for the same mistakes?</em>
</p><p align="left">The lyrics of the song hit her harder than any time  before. She had listened to this exact song several times, but it felt as if this was the first time she truly heard the lyrics and realized how much they describe her—how much they mirrored her.</p><p align="left">Rio had never been a fan of sorrow, of living whilebeing embraced by misery and agony.</p><p align="left">It wasn't her.</p><p align="left">Rio Vidal was optimistic by nature, a transport of delight. Even in the hardest moments of her life—which were many—she always managed to remain the same version of herself, always with a smile on her face. But in the past couple of years, it was as if every bit of sadness she had once refused to embrace had caught up to he and made her vulnerable, emotionally and physically.</p><p align="left">She certainly knew pain and sadness and had experienced them, hell, her whole life's foundation was built on tragedy, but she had always managed to control it—until now.</p><p>
<em>Are you right back where you started,</em>
<br/>
<em>Or have you found another way?</em>
<br/>
<em>Sugar rush, a stranger’s backyard, the devil’s holiday.</em>
</p><p align="left">She was sitting in the garden, amidst the stillnes of the evening, just as always, with a bottle of vodka by her side. She was desperately trying to use the greenery to cleanse her thoughts—to clear calm restless head, to organize the chaos.</p><p align="left">To breathe.</p><p align="left">It was her birthday. The sky was painted with stars and sailing clouds. It was midnight, the cold breeze—and her thoughts—forced tears to form at the edges of her eyes. But she refused to let them go.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't wish that she had never been born— not exactly—but it would have been nice to have good birthday memories. That day had always been a reminder of her misfortune. A reminder of how naïve she was for letting people in.</p><p align="left">Once someone showed her the slightest bit of attention. Once someone showed that they cared. She always hurried to open the door and let them in.</p><p align="left">She didn't celebrate this day, Rio hated her birth day and thought of it as reminder to how cursed she was.</p><p align="left">Whenever she thought about it, what was there to celebrate anyway? Nothing deserved in her life deserved a celebration—especially not her existence.</p><p align="left">The happiest Birthdays—and the only happy ones—were from her childhood. Whe she was surrounded by people who gave her unconditional love and care. She didn't care about the world back then, when she used to think about her next birthday during her current one.</p><p align="left">Her teenage years were devoid of something called birthdays, not because she was a moody teenager, but simply because there was no one there to celebrate with.  She didn't realize back then that once she blew out the candle on her twelfth birthday, there wouldn't be any happy candles after that one. No more innocent, childish wishes.</p><p align="left">During college, her friends always insisted on throwing parties for her, celebrating the undeserving. She appreciated it and all, but she always felt as if she was being forced into acknowledging it. Into accepting it.</p><p align="left">By the following years, her birthday became the miserable reminder that it was now—something she couldn't bear to think about.</p><p><em>You watch yourself in fragments, amongst the leaves,</em><br/><em>And you conclude that you never were much more t</em> <em>han a reflection in a pool</em></p><p align="left">Her last birthday was a complete disaster—she was laying in bed, waiting her ex–girlfriend to come, who was late and completely wasted as always, not giving a fuck about Rio's existence.</p><p align="left">It started as a reproach, turned into a loud conversation, developed into a heated argument, escalated into a fight, and ended with her ex's uncontrolled anger and violence issues, while using the victim complex as an armor.</p><p align="left">Rio's birthday ended with her walking alone around the city with a scar on her elbow and tears hanging in her eyes, wishing to be released.</p><p>
<em>Do you still wake up wrapped around an empty space?</em>
<br/>
<em>Do you only know the good days once they’ve slipped away?</em>
<br/>
<em>Do you wish that he would call you by another name?</em>
<br/>
<em>Do you pour another drink out for the same mistakes?</em>
</p><p align="left">“Hell yes, I do.” Rio said, talking to the lyrics of the song as she reached for the bottle beside her and made a toast with the air.</p><p align="left">Thinking back, she realized she was stupid. Wasn't she?</p><p align="left">An idiot, a total loser, and somehow a bitch with attachment issues. It shouldn't have gone that far. She should have dumped that bitch two years ago, spat on her and walked away. She should have left the city and found a new place. She should have achieved her dreams. She should have lived—only she didn't. And that was why she always felt guilty—guilty because she ruined herself for nothing. Because she wasted time she could never get back.</p><p align="left">Thinking about how things could have been different if she had done things differently. She wouldn't be a mess now if she had refused to get hurt for the sake of herself. She wouldn't be a fragile, depressed little thing if she hadn't put someone above herself—because not a single son of a bitch deserved to be at the top of her priorities.</p><p align="left">Yet, she allowed it.</p><p align="left">Rio looked up at the sky, it looked reae beautiful.</p><p align="left">Oh to be a bird. To be a cloud. A star. Or even a bit of smoke rising up with no return.</p><p align="left">She got inside, looked at the dim lit space and sighed—a long, low and a spent-out sigh.</p><p align="left">Rio went upstairs and lay on her back, looking at the ceiling. She hought about texting Agatha—she thought about it since Agatha had stepped out of her house, but she didn't dare to do it.</p><p align="left">Every time she reached for her phone and looked at Agatha's contact, something would strike her heart, making it pulse faster than ever.</p><p align="left">The feeling was was sweet at first, but it grew to actually hurt her. The way her heart pounded the moment she looked at Agatha's name on her phone was overwhelming by all means.</p><p align="left">It wasn't supposed to be like that, but it was as if she couldn't do anything about it. She was out-of-control.</p><p align="left">Everything in her ached for the woman, longing to hear her voice. The delightful sensation she felt from hearing the Agatha's voice were something she had never experienced before—not once in her four decades of living. And it felt hazardous. Whenever Rio thought about it, it made zero sense in her head—the way she was drawn to the woman was scary. It held an unbearable amount of risk, with uncountable layers of emotions she couldn't bear nor handle.</p><p align="left">As Rio closed her eyes, trying to sleep, a dark-haired woman appeared behind her closed eyelids.</p><p align="left">Her face was vivid, as if she were standing right in front of Rio and Rio so desperately hung onto the image of the Agatha and shut her eyes even harder. She didn't want to open them, so the Agatha wouldn't leave.</p><p align="left"><em>God</em>, it would have been so good if Agatha was here—if only Agatha was here to kiss her, to call her name, to tell her how delicious it tasted in her mouth and to tell her that everything was fine—that it would be fine because she was here beside her. But Agatha wasn't and Rio was delusional.</p><p align="left">Her phone buzzed by her side her but Rio ignored it—only to open her eyes immediately at the second buzz.</p><p align="left">As if Rio had summoned her, Agatha reached for her with a message. Rio's heart pounded harder in her chest, and heat traveled through her body once she saw the woman's name on the screen.</p><p align="left">
<em>Hi, Rio.</em>
</p><p align="left">
<em>Are you awake?</em>
</p><p align="left">Rio looked at the messages. It maybe didn't mean much, but Agatha had reached for her first. And by the gods, it definitely meant something.</p><p align="left">
<em>Yes, I am. </em>
</p><p align="left">Rio hit send and stared at the ceiling again. Probably Agatha couldn't sleep either, because it was already 4 am in where she was.</p><p align="left">
<em>Can I call you?</em>
</p><p align="left">God, this woman.</p><p align="left">
<em>Call me, just call me. Let me hear your voice. Let me listen to you breathing for hours and hours. Let me be drowned in the sweet ocean of every word you speak, sank in the depth of every tone.</em>
</p><p align="left">No, that was too much. Rio wouldn't say that. She only thought about it, and it ate her from the inside. It made her lose her sanity—or what was left of it, anyway.</p><p align="left">
<em>Yes, of course.</em>
</p><p align="left">And Agatha called. </p><p align="left">Rio cleared her throat before she swiped and answered.</p><p align="left">“<em>I've missed you.</em>”</p><p align="left">Was the first thing Agatha had said and it made Rio's heart stop for a heartbeat or two, only to come back again, beating faster, threating to escape her chest.</p><p align="left">Rio remaind silent. Her grip on the phone was tightening and she was almost gluing the device to her ear.</p><p align="left">Her eyes squeezed shut. She could hear Agatha breathing, and Rio searched everywhere for how to respond to something like... <em>that. </em>But nothing appeared in her head. Nothing could even work.</p><p align="left">For god's sake, how are you supposed to respond to something like that?</p><p align="left">“<em>God, Rio...</em>”</p><p align="left">There it was—her name wrapped in a sigh, laced with dripping sweetness.</p><p align="left">Rio's name had never sounded more beautiful.</p><p align="left">The way Again called her name, it was almost unbelievable. She wanted her name to be called by Agatha again, and again, <em>and again</em>.</p><p align="left">Rio was aware that she was silent—not a single word was coming out of her mouth—but, on the other hand? Her physical state was chaotic. Heat was radiating from her, she could feel an actual fireball resting in her stomach. A sheen of sweat appearing on her forehead. Her eyes were shut, and the only thing she could hear was Agatha's breathing. She could sense the way Agatha was waiting for her to speak. To say anything.</p><p align="left">“<em>Please</em>, let me hear you voice.” Agatha said and Rio almost passed out from the heat that was only increasing with every word Agatha said.</p><p align="left">The desperation in Agatha's tone was too much to handle and too good to reject.</p><p align="left">“Do you know—do you know what you're doing to me?” Rio finally managed to speak. She probably gathered every bit of courage in her body to form the question and ask it. And of course, with the help of the alcohol in her system.</p><p align="left">Was Agatha really unaware of what she was doing to Rio? Did she really couldn't hear how Rio's heart was pounding? How she was torturing Rio with doing the bare minimum? Or had she just decided to ignore that and just do whatever she wanted? </p><p align="left">“Do you know what <em>you're</em> doing to <em>me</em>?” Agatha repeated Rio's question, sounding even more desperate than before.</p><p align="left">“Why didn't you call me? You said you would.” Agatha asked, her tone was laced with disappointment and something softer. Rio could sense it, and <em>god</em>, it did something to her. The way Agatha was talking straightforwardly with her. Transparent, saying everything with that intense confidence. Saying what Rio wasn't able of saying. She was even afraid of thinking about it let alone say it out loud. “Say something, <em>Rio</em>.”</p><p align="left">“I don't know what to say. God, I wanted to call you, but I just....”</p><p align="left">Agatha heavily sighed. “I've never heard a sweet voice like yours, <em>Rio</em>.” Agatha interrupted Rio's already failed attempt to explain why she hadn't called.</p><p align="left">The way she ended almost every sentence with Rio's name did something to Rio. The way she said her name differently each time, but it also held the same similarity, the same taste, the same amount of heat. It made Rio's body ache.</p><p align="left">“You can't sleep?” Agatha asked, interrupting Rio's train of thoughts.</p><p align="left">“No,” Rio responded with a sigh.</p><p align="left">“Something in your head?”</p><p align="left">The way she asked it—a mixture of pure concern laced with amusement and something else—something out of reach.</p><p align="left">“Plenty of things actually.” Rio responded sincerely.</p><p align="left">Something was pushing her to talk because the safety that Agatha provided couldn't be an illusion. It was real and Rio could feel it everywhere, even in the air around her.</p><p align="left">“Do you want to talk about them?” Agatha asked, then she sighed softly. And god, how Rio wanted her to sigh right on her neck. “You can talk about anything you want, Rio. And I'll listen to you. Or, I could talk until you fall asleep.... Just name it, and I'll do it.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Please</em>, talk to me.”</p><p align="left">It was a desperate plea. It was need and yearning.</p><p align="left">And Agatha did as she promised—talking with that deep voice of hers, embracing Rio with every word. She tried to make small talks whenever Rio fell silent.</p><p align="left">They talked about a few things. The conversation felt more intimate, more personal than the one they had shared before. Rio learned a few things about Agatha—things she would definitely think about on a daily basis.</p><p align="left">Like how Agatha liked reading books, the way she had that nerdy hyperfixation on witchcraft, how she liked her coffee, her experience growing up in a religious household, how purple had become her favorite color, and how once she almost died because of a dare challenge.</p><p align="left">The more Agatha talked, the wider Rio's smile grew, and the heat in her body increased. She was floating, lost in Agatha's words, in the way Agatha described things, showed interest in more than a way and spoke flawlessly with that demanding confidence. Agatha was a goddess of a woman, and Rio was very much aware of that fact. </p><p align="left">“When is your birthday?”</p><p align="left">Agatha asked, and Rio felt her heart sink, thinking about whether she should say that her birthday was last month, or the next one—or even that her birthday was in a thirteenth month that obviously did not exist. It sounded foolish in her head, childish even.</p><p align="left">What would happen if Agatha knew it was her birthday? She wouldn't care anyway. Why would she? They were still strangers to one another after all—a stranger Rio would kill for.</p><p align="left">“It's... today.” Rio held her breath and squeezed her eyes shut. Damn it, woman.</p><p align="left">“Happy birthday, Rio.” Agatha sighed. “Happy birthday you bewitching, captivating human being.”</p><p align="left">Rio felt the way Agatha was breathing after saying every word. The way her voice sounded so close, in that slutry deep tone. And Rio was aware of how her body reacted to every word. The way she sighed, feeling her heart pounding, her stomach turning into a heat pool. The way the words hit every pulse point in Rio's body. It was insane even, the way she couldn't breathe once the words reached her ear.</p><p align="left">“I wish I was there, with you right now.”</p><p align="left">“I wish you were with me. I <em>want</em> you here with me, Agatha.” Her intention was to say that as a low murmur to herself, as a soundless thought in her head, but somehow she said it aloud, and she felt the way Agatha's breath hitched at her confession.</p><p align="left">And somehow, the silence stretched between them. Not a single word was spoken, but it felt safe, as if you were sitting with someone you knew you could be yourself with—someone who would understand you with just a look, and in their case, with just an intake of breath or a tone of voice.</p><p align="left">“What do you believe in, Rio?” Agatha's voice returned after moments of silence, and the question felt different in a way.</p><p align="left">
<em>What did Rio believe in?</em>
</p><p align="left">She took a deep breath before speaking, as if holding her thoughts inside. Afraid they would shatter and she'd be left with nothing.</p><p align="left">“If you had asked me this a while ago, I would have been able to answer it, gladly,” a sigh. “I used to have faith in lots of things, you know? Because I had that kind of hope—the kind that made me save what I have now in order to have something later. And I lived with that for a long time. But lately, that faith shattered. I feel that I no longer have faith in anything, I no longer believe in something, and I can't even recall what I once believed in. It's as if everything was nothing but an illusion, and it disappeared once I regained my consciousness. But god, I don't even feel conscious.” Rio pressed her fingers into her eyes to release some tension. “Does that make any sense?”</p><p align="left">“It actually makes all the sense in the world.”</p><p align="left">And silence fell upon once again, until Rio spoke.</p><p align="left">“And you, do you believe in anything?”</p><p align="left">Agatha took a few moments to respond. And Rio was carefully listening to her breaths that became softer.</p><p align="left">“I never really believed in anything. I always... doubted. Always had the sense that something didn't sit right. That things should make sense to me before I could acknowledge them, let alone believe in them. But lately... I'm starting to believe in something that doesn't really make sense. And whenever I try to put sense into it, it remains the same.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? And what is that?”</p><p align="left">“I can't even name it, <em>Rio</em>.”</p><p align="left">Rio rested her head on the pillow, phone still glued to her ear, listening to everything Agatha was saying. Every little thing.</p><p align="left">“Did I bore you yet?” Agatha asked, and Rio closed her eyes.</p><p align="left">“Never.” Rio breathed the word—it was a whisper that held so much weight. “When will you come back?” </p><p align="left">“Probably tomorrow.”</p><p align="left">She wanted to tell her to hurry up, to come sooner so she could see her. But Rio wasn't in that position, to tell Agatha to come back and embrace her, to feel her presence.</p><p align="left">Rio's eyes remained closed. She was so still, relaxed even. She heard Agatha calling her name and managed to mumble a few words. She was drifting between consciousness and unconsciousness when she heard a low, sweet laugh escape from Agatha—and she smiled.</p><p align="left">“<em>Sleep well,</em>”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">When was the last time had she really talked with someone for hours? <em>Never</em>—Rio had never done that before.</p><p align="left">When was the last time she had falling asleep with a smile on her face? A long time ago, or maybe never. Debatable.</p><p align="left">When she woke up later, she felt good. It had only been a few hours of sleep but they were peaceful. She hadn't woken up panicking in the middle of her sleep—which had become the norm lately. No, Rio had actually slept like a human being, for the first time in months. </p><p align="left">Her smile didn't fade the entire day. Even when someone spilled their coffee on her white shirt, she just looked at them and smiled.</p><p align="left">Maybe things weren't that bad. Maybe she only needed someone to be truly present—even when they weren't. And that someone was Agatha.</p><p align="left">Because even in her absence, Agatha was still there. In Rio's head all the time. She had glimpsed a bit of her in Alice's office today and smiled—fragments of her everywhere. Or maybe it was Rio who had started to see and sense the woman everywhere. </p><p align="left">Once she got in her car, her phone buzzed—Alice.</p><p align="left">“Hey, are you still in campus?”</p><p align="left">“I'm heading home. Why?”</p><p align="left">“Wait, I'm coming.”</p><p align="left">And within five minutes, Alice was there.</p><p align="left">“Hey. Do you wanna go out? We're having a night out. It's just me, Jen, and Lilia—she's bringing a friend...”</p><p align="left">“A friend? Agatha?”</p><p align="left">“No, no, it's someone else. Another artist, I assume. She knows Agatha. Wanda Maximoff.”</p><p align="left">“I don't know her.”</p><p align="left">“Neither do I.”</p><p align="left">A moment of silence and then it clicked in Rio's head.</p><p align="left">“Alice...” Rio looked at her friend suspiciously with narrowed eyes.</p><p align="left">“Is this one of those suprise parties you throw every two years? The ones I <em>always</em> tell you not to throw?”</p><p align="left">Alice scratched her neck awkwardly. “No.”</p><p align="left">“Alice Wu-Gulliver, you just scratched your neck, and I <em>know</em> that means you're about to lie.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, yes!” </p><p align="left">“Jesus Christ.” Rio said, a shit–eating grin spreading across her face.</p><p align="left">“See? if I told you, you wouldn't come.”</p><p align="left">“I'll come though.”</p><p align="left">“Seriously?”</p><p align="left">“I know that sounds out of character, but yeah, seriously.” </p><p align="left">“God, I love happy Rio!”</p><p align="left">“What do you mean?” Rio chuckled.</p><p align="left">“I don't know what happened, but I <em>fucking love</em> seeing that smile back on your face. Dude, it suits you.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? I'm just optimistic by nature. You know that.”</p><p align="left">And they both laughed, because it was a fact and they knew it. Maybe Rio doubted it, but Alice knew it by heart.</p><p align="left">Alice hugged her warmly and wished her a happy birthday before they left.</p><hr/><p align="left">Rio got ready to meet her friends. She grabbed her keys and stepped outside when her phone buzzed in her pocket.</p><p align="left">
<em>How was your day?</em>
</p><p align="left">And a smile spread across Rio's face—so wide it almost didn't fit into the world. It almost shone the darkness of the night.</p><p align="left">She sat on the chair in her garden—the same chair where she had been eating herself alive the night before.</p><p align="left">
<em>It was good.</em>
</p><p align="left">She looked at the message and deleted it</p><p align="left">Because honestly? Her day wasn't just good, it was the best she'd had in a while.</p><p align="left">
<em>It was great. Thanks to you.</em>
</p><p align="left">And she sent it, because she must show her gratitude to the woman. After all, she was the reason.</p><p align="left">
<em>Well, actually thanks to you.</em>
</p><p align="left">
<em>Are you doing something tonight?</em>
</p><p align="left">She looked at the message for a while.</p><p align="left">
<em>Yes, I'm going out with my friends.</em>
</p><p align="left">
<em>Okay, have fun xx</em>
</p><p align="left">A silly grin took over her face at that.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She went to the usual bar, and everybody was already there, waiting for her—the ones Alice had mentioned and two other women Rio knew but wasn't particularly close to. Her social bubble was incredibly small after all.</p><p align="left">Once she approached, they cheered for her, showering her with smiles, happy birthdays, and hugs. A little overwhelming, but sweet nonetheless.</p><p align="left">The red–haired woman who was sitting beside Lilia caught Rio's attention—that must be Wanda.</p><p align="left">The woman reached out for a handshake, offering a soft smile that Rio found sweet.</p><p align="left">The conversations flowed through the air—introductions, a little teasing here and there, warmth wrapping around them like a blanket. And Rio thought... maybe things weren't really that bad.</p><p align="left">“So..” Wanda spoke as she looked at Rio.</p><p align="left">Rio smiled as she swirled the ice in her glass, encouraging the woman to continue. But it seemed like Wanda didn't actually have something to say, so Rio spoke instead.</p><p align="left">“So, you know Agatha?”</p><p align="left">Apparently, Rio was a little too curious about how the two knew each other. And she knew something was there when Wanda's eyes widened slightly and also she didn't miss the way Lilia's head turned toward her at the mention of the name.</p><p align="left">Wanda took a sip of her drink. “Yes, Agatha... I know her.” Wanda met Rio's gaze before adding “Some pages of history have been written between us.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? What kind of history?”</p><p align="left">Wanda laughed awkwardly, and Rio noticed. How could she not? It was written all over the woman's face.</p><p align="left">“Some professional pages... and intimate ones.”</p><p align="left">There it was. That was what Rio wanted to read—the intimate pages.</p><p align="left">“Do you know her?” Wanda asked.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her for a moment, then nodded as she took a sip of her drink.</p><p align="left">“Mhm.” Wanda hummed as her gaze shifted.</p><p align="left">Something was there. Definitely. But Rio couldn't quite place it. It was already inappropriate enough to ask, but she needed to dig deeper—maybe she'd find gold, or bones, who knew?</p><p align="left">“So... you guys are exes?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh.</em>”</p><p align="left">That was enough. Exes. That was all what Rio needed to know. </p><p align="left">That was what fueled something else inside her.</p><p align="left">The night came to an end. She had her fun. Thanked her friends, hugged them warmly and headed out. The cold breeze sobered her up a little. She wasn't really <em>that</em> drunk, or was she?</p><p align="left">When Rio got home, she stepped out of the car and wobbled slightly as she walked to the door. That was when she noticed a black box sitting on the doorstep.</p><p align="left">Rio arched a brow in confusion and bent down to pick it up. It looked luxurious, something she wouldn't have ordered or bought herself.</p><p align="left">Opening it, she found a little note inside:</p><p align="left">
<strong>Happy birthday, Rio.</strong>
</p><p align="left">
<strong>I hope you'll wear this when I finally take you out on a date.</strong>
</p><p align="left">
<strong>A xx</strong>
</p><p align="left">Rio's heart rapidly pounded in her chest. She peeked into the box, then hurried inside.</p><p align="left">Inside was a black dress and a perfume bottle. </p><p align="left">She ran her fingers over the fabric, feeling its softness carefully.</p><p align="left">She picked up the perfume bottle and smelled it—once, twice. Then she sprayed it on her wrist and inhaled again.</p><p align="left">It smelled like something Rio would wear, it smelled like <em>her</em>.</p><p align="left">She looked at the label again. It was a perfume she recognized from somewhere, that was why it smelled like nostalgia and something else. </p><p align="left">Rio set the box on the table and just... stared at it.</p><p align="left">She stared at the little note for so long that the letters started to blur.</p><p align="left">Heat crept through her body, spreading with every second, she could feel it in every part of her body, traveling like a slow burn until it finally reached its destination, to her core.</p><p align="left">
<em>That woman.</em>
</p><p align="left">Rio took the box upstairs. Once inside her bedroom, she placed it on the bed and started taking off her clothes.</p><p align="left">She took the dress out meticulously, almost afraid it would somehow disappear from her hands—or worse, transform into something else entirely.</p><p align="left">When she finally put it on, she turned to the full–length mirror.</p><p align="left">It was insane—the way the dress hugged her body so <em>perfectly</em>, accentuating every curve exhaustively.</p><p align="left">The V-cut by the thigh... god it looked perfect.</p><p align="left">Rio ran her hands over the fabric, feeling every inch of it against her skin.</p><p align="left">Heat only increased when she thought about how Agatha had known her size after seeing her just a few times—enough to pick out something that fitted her <em>flawlessly</em>.</p><p align="left">Her hands cupped her breasts over the fabric, and <em>god</em>, it was tormenting—the way her body <em>begged</em> for a touch at that moment.</p><p align="left">Rio kept feeling herself, her eyes locked onto her reflection.</p><p align="left">The air around her was thick, suffocating. </p><p align="left">And in her head?</p><p align="left">Only Agatha Harkness.</p><p align="left">She slid her hand down, tracing along the thigh cut before slipping her fingers beneath the fabric, pushing her underwear aside.</p><p align="left">A sharp inhale. Her fingers met an agonizing heat and slickness.</p><p align="left">She collected the evidence of her arousal and started rubbing her clit roughly, hyperaware of what she was wearing. Of <em>who</em> it was from.</p><p align="left">She moaned a curse at how fast her orgasm was building up.</p><p align="left">A few more strokes, and she came, pleasure running through her entire body as she cried out Agatha's name.</p><p align="left">Her legs shook, and her breath was heavy.</p><p align="left">Rio stumbled back onto the bed, laying there with a dazed smile on her face. </p><p align="left">“<em>Oh, fuck.</em>” she muttered, grinning stupidly.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="left">Lying on the bed, staring at the ceiling, her hands wandered over her body above the fabric, feeling every inch of it. She was in a state that resembled being high—only she wasn't. It was as if she were floating out of her body, like a ghost without its sheet. She didn't know exactly why she felt that way, she didn't even know <em>how</em> she felt. How a piece of fabric had taken over her mind so completely.</p><p align="left">Was it really about the dress? Absolutely not. It was about that woman, Agatha—who Rio had come to realize—was starting to control her body and mind with the smallest things that held massive weight.</p><p align="left">From the moment she first saw her that night at that bar, Rio had felt it—like something striking her heart the moment she saw the woman's eyes. And it only grew, more painful, becoming a pain she couldn't get enough of. Because it hurt—but <em>sweetly</em>. It wounded her, yet the pain was good, like a reminder that she was <em>still</em> alive. That the rotting organ in the left of her chest was still there, still capable of pounding faster for reasons other than a panic attack. And she felt it every time she was with Agatha, every time she thought of her.</p><p align="left">When Agatha had asked that unexpected question at Alice's party to start a conversation, a question that embarrassed Rio yet it made her heart race, and it became faster and faster each time. When their shoulders brushed for a second. When she saw Agatha's artwork. When Lilia mentioned her name. When Agatha offered her a glass of wine. When she looked at her that day. When they smoked together. When they talked over dinner. When Agatha gave her her number. Or when their eyes met across the crowded club.</p><p align="left">When they sat and talked, and Agatha asked if she wanted to see her studio. When Rio saw a painting of herself there. When they kissed, a heated and a hungry kiss that went wrong at the end. Then the way Agatha called her name. When Agatha touched her hand. When she kissed her again on the couch. When she hugged her at the doorstep like they'd known eachother forever. Or when Agatha called her and stayed on the phone for hours just so Rio could fall asleep.</p><p align="left">When she asked about her day later. And now, this birthday present that overwhelmed her.</p><p align="left">Every single time, Rio's heart pounded in an insane way—so much it felt dangerous. Like her heart might just rip itself out of her chest, grow legs, and run away as a bleeding organ. And it was absurd, the fact that Rio couldn't stop thinking about Agatha. The fact that she wanted her here, by her side.</p><p align="left">
<em>Was she falling in love? Or was she already in love?</em>
</p><p align="left">Her fingers kept tracing the fabric, sliding up and down with her eyes closed.</p><p align="left">Rio inhaled as much oxygen as her lungs could take, then exhaled after a few seconds. Rising to her feet, she went downstairs, poured herself a glass of wine, grabbed an apple and curled up on the couch, putting on some old show to watch. Ten minutes passed, she was bored, and sleep hadn't found its way to her yet. </p><p align="left">She scrolled through her phone, no notifications of any kind.</p><p align="left">Then it hit her. Should she text Agatha? Thank her for the gift? Or leave it for the morning? Or the next time she saw her?</p><p align="left">Her heart pounded at the thought of seeing Agatha again and Rio suddenly became aware of what she was wearing.</p><p align="left">She stood up and was heading toward her bedroom, when a knock on the front door stopped her mid-step. Rio's eyebrows furrowed in confusion, it was nearly 1 am, who would knock at her door?</p><p align="left">She stood still for a moment, maybe she hadn't heard it right.</p><p align="left">Then the knock came again, not urgent, not impatient—it was slow, waiting.</p><p align="left">Rio walked toward the door and opened it, and the sight before her nearly made her faint.</p><p align="left">“It's inappropriate for me to be here, isn't it?”</p><p align="left">The voice only made it feel more absurd, like this was a dream and nothing else. </p><p align="left">“Rio...” before Agatha could continue whatever she was about to say, Rio stepped closer and took her lips in a kiss. It wasn't rushed or lustful—it was soft, something honest. As if Rio couldn't believe what was in front of her. As if she needed to make sure this wasn't one of her daydreams.</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't pull back and neither did Rio. Instead, Agatha returned the kiss with more heat and fervor, her hands finding Rio's hips.</p><p align="left">Rio started walking backwards, leading them both inside. The door remained open, letting the cold breeze seep into Rio's warm haven.</p><p align="left">She pushed Agatha gently against the nearest wall, their mouths never parting—kissing, tasting, sucking and pouring every feeling and thought they had into each other's mouths.</p><p align="left">Rio pulled back just a few inches. They both were trying to catch their breaths.</p><p align="left">“I just wanted to make sure you're real.” Rio said, her voice uneven as she tried to steady her breathing.</p><p align="left">“I'm real. And I'm here with you now.” </p><p align="left">Rio smiled, unable to shake the shock away from her system.</p><p align="left">Agatha was here. In her house. In the middle of the night. Without a warning.</p><p align="left">“How... how are you <em>here</em>?” Rio asked, still trying to calm her chaotic state.</p><p align="left">“I missed you. I wanted to be here before the day ended so I could be here on your birthday, but it didn't work out...”</p><p align="left">“You came here... for me?”</p><p align="left">“Yes, I came her for you.” Agatha murmured, giving Rio's hips a slight squeeze.</p><p align="left">Rio grinned and really looked at Agatha—at her tired, yet beautiful features. Her blue eyes, her lips, and <em>god</em>, that perfect nose.</p><p align="left">Agatha smirked, her gaze drifting over what Rio was wearing.</p><p align="left">“So you recieved my gift?”</p><p align="left">Rio didn't understand the question at first, too lost in the face of the woman before her—the woman that was pinned against the wall. In her goddamn house.</p><p align="left">But then realization hit her, heat rushed to her face, turning her cheeks pink.</p><p align="left">“Guess I did,” Rio managed to say.</p><p align="left">Agatha's gaze lingered, studying every feature, every detail, as if she were committing them to memory.</p><p align="left">They stayed like that for a couple of minutes, just... looking at each other, making sure they were both really there and lost in each other's faces. </p><p align="left">A shiver ran through Rio's body as the cold breeze slipped in from the open door. Without thinking, Agatha's hand moved instinctively to Rio's exposed arms, trying to provide some warmth.</p><p align="left">But Rio's body shivered for a different reason, for the fact that Agatha's palms were on her skin. Their eyes met again. Their faces only a few inches apart, both of them hovering on the edge of a kiss but neither making the move.</p><p align="left">“Shouldn't we close that door so you don't get sick?” Agatha asked, squeezing Rio's arms gently.</p><p align="left">Rio nodded and stepped aside to close the door. She motioned for Agatha to come inside, and as she did, Rio's hand hold Agatha's—a hold that felt so natural, like it was the only thing to do. The only right thing to do.</p><p align="left">Their fingers intertwined and Agatha tightened the hold slightly.</p><p align="left">They sat on the couch—the almost-empty glass of wine resting on the table and the slow hum of the TV filling the silence.</p><p align="left">They looked into each other's eyes for a long time, neither speaking, neither moving.</p><p align="left">The comfort they found in one another was too good to be disturbed, but eventually, it would be.</p><p align="left">Their fingers remained intertwined, their eyes locked, searching and finding what they were looking for in each other's faces.</p><p align="left">The silence between them wasn't empty, it was full—full of warmth, disbelief and <em>yearning</em>.</p><p align="left">“What are you doing here?” Rio finally asked, her voice a low murumr. It was barely above a whisper.</p><p align="left">Agatha stayed silent for a while.</p><p align="left">“I don't know.” she admitted. “Since yesterday, the only thing I could think about was... how to see you again as soon as possible. The next thing I knew... I was on a plane, and then at your doorstep. I didn't even know if I'd find you awake and you'd be annoyed in any way, or asleep and I'd have to walk away. I didn't know what possessed my mind at the time. I honestly don't know.”</p><p align="left">Agatha paused for a brief moment then spoke again. “My intention was to come sooner, but I couldn't.” her gaze remained fixed on Rio. “I should've told you.”</p><p align="left">“So you were on a plane coming back to LA when you asked about my day?”</p><p align="left">“Yes.”</p><p align="left">Rio's hand reached up to touch the back of Agatha's neck, her thumb stroking her cheek gently—a touch filled with disbelief. Rio still couldn't quite grasp the absurdity of the situation or how natural it felt, as if Agatha had always come back <em>home</em> to her. </p><p align="left">“Why would I be annoyed?” Rio asked, leaning closer. The fingers that had once been intertwined with Agatha's were resting on her face. Both of her hands cupped Agatha's face.</p><p align="left">“I can't believe it. Can you?” Rio said.</p><p align="left">“No, I can't believe that I'm actually sitting here with you, feeling your touch on my face. It doesn't feel real.” </p><p align="left">Agatha's hands rested on Rio's wrists. Their faces only a breath apart. </p><p align="left">“You didn't go to Lilia's house?”</p><p align="left">Agatha shook her head.</p><p align="left">“Or your studio?”</p><p align="left">Another slight shake.</p><p align="left">“And your luggage?”</p><p align="left">“In the car.” </p><p align="left">“So you really came straight from the airport... to <em>me</em>?”</p><p align="left">“Yes.” Agatha murmured, her thumbs gently stroking Rio's wrists. Her fingers were cold against Rio's heating skin.</p><p align="left">Rio was still in disbelief as her hands remained cradling Agatha's face.</p><p align="left">They leaned even closer, the space between them shrank to the bare minimum. Their eyes were locked, their thumbs were tracing soft circles against each other's skin. They were certain—undeniably certain—that they were about to kiss.</p><p align="left">Rio smiled, an honest, beautiful smile—one that Agatha couldn't ignore, so a similar one found its way on her lips. Reflecting Rio's.</p><p align="left">“Are you tired?” Rio asked, looking directly into the blue ocean in Agatha's eyes.</p><p align="left">“No.”</p><p align="left">“Do you want to drink something?” Rio suggested as she leaned even <em>closer</em>—if that was even possible. But she did it. Their bodies touched, their hands never let go, and their eyes never looked away. Not even once.</p><p align="left">“Can I kiss you?” Agatha asked, her thumbs stilled on Rio's wrists. Her eyes were drinking in every detail of that beautiful face before her.</p><p align="left">Rio only smiled and nodded, unable to form a coherent word.</p><p align="left">Agatha wasted no time. The second Rio nodded, Agatha's lips captured hers in a heated journey, pouring every emotion she felt into the kiss. She took Rio's bottom lip between her own, kissing and sucking it softly. But despite all the tenderness, there was the hunger in every movement, something Rio couldn't name but she felt it.</p><p align="left">Agatha left the bottom lip and moved higher to treat the upper one the same way. With each press, each suck, each nip and a little bite—Agatha was devouring her. Rio felt her lips going completely numb.</p><p align="left">A second later, Agatha pulled away. Her gaze flickered to Rio's swollen lips before locking onto her brown eyes with so much softness that Rio could barely comprehend it. But she felt it, traveling through the air between them and struck her heart, making it pound relentlessly.</p><p align="left">Agatha's hands found the back or Rio's neck and pulled her closer. Their mouths met again. Tongues rolled and intertwined. Agatha's tongue explored every bit it could reach, every corner of Rio's mouth, leaving nothing untouched. <em>Unsucked </em>with her tongue.</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled back for a brief second—only to claim and devour Rio's mouth once again in the following second. She sucked on Rio's tongue with an intoxicating mix of heat, hunger and lust.</p><p align="left">After minutes of desperate devouring of each other's mouths, they pulled back. Their eyes found eace other, chests were rising and falling heavilras air rushed into their lungs.</p><p align="left">Agatha's hands remained at the back of Rio's neck, while at some point, Rio's had found their way to Agatha's hips.</p><p align="left">Rio leaned in again, brushing Agatha's lips with hers before resting her forehead against hers.</p><p align="left">“I don't know if it makes sense,” Rio murmured, her breathing was still unsteady, “But... I've been waiting for you to come back. <em>To me.</em>” Her voice dropped lower at the last confession.</p><p align="left">Agatha's left hand moved higher, resting on the back of Rio's head as she stroked her hair gently.</p><p align="left">“It makes all the sense in the world,” she whispered, then she kissed Rio's forehead. Her soft lips, meeting Rio's hot skin.</p><p align="left">They stayed like that for a couple of minutes. It felt natural, as if they had been doing this forever.</p><p align="left">After a moment, Rio's face found its way to the crook of Agatha's neck, to get buried there. In the warmth of Agatha's skin.</p><p align="left">One of Rio's Hands moved higher, resting on the left side of Agatha's chest, feeling her heart pounding—as if that organ was right between her hands. She closed her eyes and just listened to the beating of the woman's heart. </p><p align="left">“Your heart is pounding really fast,” Rio said, almost a whisper, but the warmth of her breath sent a shiver to ran through Agatha's body.</p><p align="left">The closeness felt so right. The warmth of their bodies pressed together was so natural, as if they had done this every single day—only they hadn't.</p><p align="left">This was the first time. But it felt like... <em>home</em>.</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled, “It's because of you.”</p><p align="left">Even with Rio's face buried in her neck, Agatha could sense the grin spreading across Rio's lips.</p><p align="left">“And your skin is really hot.”</p><p align="left">“Mhmm. It's because of you.”</p><p align="left">Rio's hands found their way around Agatha's middle, forming an embrace, and her head replaced her hand on Agatha's chest—now listening to her heartbeat directly in her ear.</p><p align="left">Agatha's hands instinctively sought Rio's form, pulling her closer, holding her tightly, afraid she might melt away. </p><p align="left">“And your body is trembling.”</p><p align="left">Agatha laughed, a breathy laugh, and leaned down to press a tender kiss on Rio's temple.</p><p align="left">“I know. And that's also because of you.”</p><p align="left">They stayed like that for a while, lost in the warmth and safety of their embrace—indifferent to time or the sensibility of reality.</p><p align="left">Rio felt safe, sheltered in that embrace. A safety she had never known—not once in her entire life. She felt seen and understood without speaking a word. She felt alive between Agatha's arms, and whatever she did, it felt natural. It felt raw and real. Every touch, every whisper, every little act. As if this had always been her <em>home</em>—between Agatha's hands, shielded there.</p><p align="left">Her breaths had never been this steady in ages. Her heart had never felt this calm. The chaos in her head had never been this organized. It was as if, for the first time, she truly felt like a living human being.</p><p align="left">If she stayed like that for an another minute, she'd fall asleep immediately. So Rio lifted her head, looking at Agatha through her eyelashes.</p><p align="left">“Does it scare you?”</p><p align="left">Agatha showed her a confused expression, encouraging Rio to go on, so she continued. “How natural this feels?”</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled and began running her fingers gently through Rio's hair. “No. I don't quite understand it but it doesn't scare me.”</p><p align="left">Rio stole a small kiss from Agatha's lips before sitting up straight again, though their hands remained where they were—wrapped around each other's middles. They fitted there.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted one of her hands and traced Agatha's face, especially her nose, moving up and down. It amazed her how Agatha remained silent, just letting her do as she pleased. It was unbelievable, unreal. Almost overwhelming.</p><p align="left">“Do you want a drink?” Rio whispered, afraid to disturb the pleasant silence more than necessary.</p><p align="left">Agatha hummed in affirmation.</p><p align="left">“I'll be right back,” Rio murmured.</p><p align="left">Agatha pressed a gentle kiss to the hand that had just been on her face, then another soft one to Rio's lips.</p><p align="left">Rio stood and took the glass from the table, feeling Agatha's gaze on her as she walked away. And once again, she realized what she was wearing.</p><p align="left">A minute later, Rio returned with two glasses of wine and a bottle—doing the exact same thing for the second time. But this time, it felt different. Because it was different.</p><p align="left">She handed a glass to Agatha and looked at her. Agatha returned the unreadable look with a smirk.</p><p align="left">“Does this mean this is our date?” Agatha asked, glancing at Rio from head to toe. “Because you're wearing it.” She gestured at the dress with her glass. </p><p align="left">Rio smiled, her skin flushed before she sat beside Agatha once again.</p><p align="left">“If you want it to be, it could be.”</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled at that. “So you'd agree to go on a date with me?”</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her gaze from the glass resting between her hands and looked at Agatha, finding comfort in those beautiful features.</p><p align="left">“I'd be a fool if I didn't.”</p><p align="left">Agatha's smirk returned, that mysterious look in her eyes full of mischief. “You look beautiful.” </p><p align="left">“Thank you... Um, the dress... It fits me. Perfectly.”</p><p align="left">“Yes, I see that.” Agatha said, taking a sip of wine. Her smirk was visible even from behind the glass. “Why are you wearing it, though?”</p><p align="left">Rio's face flushed again, cycling through dozens of shades of red before settling into a deep crimson as her mind replayed the last few hours leading up to Agatha's arrival. </p><p align="left">“I—I just wanted to try it on, that's all.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah.” Rio said, taking a sip from her glass, then another.</p><p align="left">And another.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned closer and inhaled Rio's neck for a brief second.</p><p align="left">“Mhm. You're wearing it.”</p><p align="left">“Yes.” Rio said again as yet another sip of wine found its way to her mouth.</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled affectionately. “Please, Rio. Just relax.”</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her once again, “I don't think that's possible.”</p><p align="left">“Am I making you nervous?”</p><p align="left">“Yes.”</p><p align="left">“Should I leave?” Agatha said, raising an eyebrow, her smirk is playful—she already knew the answer, but she was wicked like that.</p><p align="left">“No, <em>of course</em> not,” Rio rejected immediately.</p><p align="left">“Then what? Hmm? Does the space between us make you nervous? Should I come closer?” Agatha asked, and she was already leaning <em>closer</em>.</p><p align="left">Rio's breath hitched, and the next second, she was holding it—just as if they hadn't been embracing, body to body, only ten minutes ago. But this time, it was different. This time, she could see Agatha's eyes, could sense something lurking beneath them—thirst, hunger and something more. So much more.</p><p align="left">In the next moment, Agatha's hand rested on Rio's— the one lying in the space between them. Agatha looked down at their hands, and when she looked back up at Rio, something in her gaze had shifted.</p><p align="left">“You're holding your breath.” Agatha said, and Rio exhaled immediately. “Good. Now, <em>please</em> breathe.” Agatha said as she tucked a strand of Rio's hair behind her ear with her other hand and started stroking her cheekbone with her thumb.</p><p align="left">Rio did as she was told, trying to steady her breaths as Agatha's soft touches guided her, melting the tension from her muscles. She closed her eyes as Agatha's thumb drifted lower, wiping away a drop of wine from the edge of her mouth.</p><p align="left">Rio exhaled through her nose, eyes still closed.</p><p align="left">“What time is it?” Agatha asked, her hands still moving in a steady rhythm—one stroking Rio's cheek, the other tracing gentle patterns on the back of her hand.</p><p align="left">Rio opened her eyes, meeting the blue ones watching her, then turned to glance at the hanging clock on the wall.</p><p align="left">“One fifty.”</p><p align="left">“Hmm,” Agatha hummed in response.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her for a moment, then she spoke, her voice barely above a whisper. “<em>Don't leave.</em>”</p><p align="left">“I won't.” Agatha said, taking Rio's hand and pressing a soft kiss to it. <em>“I won't.</em>” Another kiss.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Rio walked with Agatha to the door so she could grab her suitcase from the car. As she stood their, her thoughts spiraled—would Agatha sleep in the guest room or... With her, in her bedroom?</p><p align="left">Of course, Agatha would sleep in the guest room. Right? It was common sense.</p><p align="left">Agatha returned a couple of minutes later, catching Rio's gaze before stepping inside. Rio turned and led the way upstairs.</p><p align="left">As they walked, they passed the open door of Rio's bedroom on their way to the guest room in the middle of the hall, Agatha noticed the hesitation in Rio's steps but she said nothing.</p><p align="left">When they reached the room, Rio took Agatha's suitcase and set it inside.</p><p align="left">“I'll get you some towels. The bathroom is here.” Rio said, pointing at the door.</p><p align="left">“Thank you,” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p align="left">Rio left, returning a couple of minutes later with fresh towels and a glass of water.</p><p align="left">“Here,” She offered, handing the glass to Agatha who was sitting on the bed.</p><p align="left">“Thank you. I—U know this is strange.” Agatha said with half a chuckle. “I'll leave in the morning. I really don't want to intrude...”</p><p align="left">“You're not intruding, Agatha.” Rio said, sitting beside her and taking her hand in hers.</p><p align="left">“No, yeah. But I should go and see the house.”</p><p align="left">“You found the one you've been looking for?”</p><p align="left">“Yes, I think.”</p><p align="left">“So you're settling here?” Rio asked, stroking Agatha's hand with her thumb.</p><p align="left">“I am,” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p align="left">Rio wanted to talk with Agatha, to just sit with her, feel her, but she didn't.</p><p align="left">“Alright, I'll let you rest now.” Rio said softly, glancing at their hands resting on the bed.</p><p align="left">Agatha gave her hand a gentle squeeze. “Thank you.” </p><p align="left">“For what?” Rio asked, brows furrowing in confusion.</p><p align="left">“For this.”</p><p align="left">Rio couldn't quite grasp what Agatha meant by <em>this</em>—because <em>this</em> could mean everything or nothing at all. But she didn't push for an explanation, instead, she simply smiled in return.</p><p align="left">She got up after gently placing Agatha's hand on the bed. </p><p align="left">She hesitated as she looked at Agatha—at her eyes, at how breathtakingly beautiful she was. Her heart pounded faster the longer she stared, and Agatha was only looking back at her. Rio didn't know if she wanted to kiss Agatha goodnight, embrace her again, or to push her onto the bed and do the next thing that came to mind. None of those options felt appropriate. The longer she stood there, the deeper her hesitation grew.</p><p align="left">Yes, she had kissed Agatha at the doorstep. She had kissed her again and again on the couch. She embraced her gently, wrapped in intimacy and warmth. But in that moment? She didn't know.</p><p align="left">Agatha noticed the unreadable hesitation in Rio's expression once again, so she decided to take matters into her own hands, she rose to her feet and faced her.</p><p align="left">“Do you want something? Just say it, Rio.” she said as she took both of Rio's hands in hers and looked directly into her eyes.</p><p align="left">The question was so soft, filled with consideration, a question that hit Rio right in the heart. Agatha had said her name earlier this evening, but this time... it was different.</p><p align="left">Rio held Agatha's gaze, searching for a way to name what she wanted. What did she want?</p><p align="left">A few seconds passed. The two of them standing face to face, their fingers intertwined. Agatha squeezed Rio's hand gently, and the feeling overwhelmed her.</p><p align="left">Rio sighed heavily. “Kiss me.” She said.</p><p align="left">And the next second, Agatha did. Their lips found each other's once again for this evening, but this kiss was different. It was tender and soft, as if they were saying everything they couldn't put into words. Their fingers remained intertwined by their sides, the air around them was thick with affection. </p><p align="left">When they pulled away, Agatha smiled as she looked at Rio, the black fabric still hugging her body.</p><p align="left">“Good night, Rio.” Agatha whispered, pressing a kiss to the back of her left hand, then her right. She leaned in, brushing a kiss against Rio's forehead, and then, once more, against her soft lips. </p><p align="left">Rio didn't say anything—not for minutes. Then, finally, she spoke. “Good night, Agatha.” </p><p align="left">Her voice was quiet but full of emotion.</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled, and Rio turned around to leave, closing the door behind her.</p><p align="left">She leaned against it for a second, catching her breath.</p><p align="left">“God, what an idiot.” She muttered, closing her eyes while pressing her back against the door, and her chest was rising and falling heavily.</p><p align="left">She walked to her bedroom.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at herself in the mirror, and something was different, something in her face, something she couldn't quite name, but whatever it was, it looked good on her.</p><p align="left">Then, for what felt like the hundredth time that evening, she became hyperaware of what she was wearing. The fabric hugged her perfectly, so perfectly that she barely even felt it on her body</p><p align="left">But she took it off anyway, changing into something different.</p><p align="left">After brushing her teeth and washing her face, Rio lay on the bed, pulling the blanket over her body. But no warmth, no softness could compare to the comfort she had felt in Agatha's embrace. </p><p align="left">Minutes passed as she struggled to sleep. She needed to wake up in a few hours—but first, she had to fall asleep.</p><p align="left">But how could she, when she was hyperaware of who was sleeping in the other room? </p><p align="left">The thought of Agatha, possibly asleep just down the hall made Rio's heart pound irrationally.</p><p align="left">But she forced her eyes shut anyway, because what else could she do?</p><hr/><p align="left">Rio was lying on Agatha's bare chest, the widest grin on her face. She could feel Agatha's fingers moving smoothly along her bare back, leaving a trail of warmth. Their bodies were pressed together, heat radiating between them, igniting something deep inside her.</p><p align="left">But the dream didn't last. Her eyes snapped open to the darkness of her bedroom. She exhaled, rolling onto her back and pressing her fingers to her eyelids. Rio reached for her phone. Damn, it was still early.</p><p align="left">Rio tried to go back to sleep but she couldn't. So, instead, she decided to take the shower she had delayed earlier.</p><p align="left">Afterwards, she went downstairs, brewing the coffee her body craved. </p><p align="left">She sat at the table with her laptop open in front of her, replying to the endless flood of emails. Then she heard footsteps approaching, she looked up —Agatha, looking heavenly, as always. </p><p align="left">“Good morning.” Agatha greeted, flashing the widest smile Rio had ever seen on her face. </p><p align="left">“Good morning. Why are you awake?” </p><p align="left">“I couldn't really sleep,” Agatha admitted, standing still.</p><p align="left">“Do you want some coffee?” Rio asked as she stood—suddenly so hyperaware of how short her shorts were. She tugged at the hem and tried to pull the fabric down.</p><p align="left">Agatha's gaze flickered to the movement of her hands for a brief second before returning to Rio's face.</p><p align="left">“Yes, please.” She said, taking a seat in the chair beside the one Rio had been occupying.</p><p align="left">“Um... do you want breakfast?”</p><p align="left">“What are you making?”</p><p align="left">“Nothing at the moment, but, I could make some eggs and bacon?” Rio offered with a smile, scratching the back of her neck nervously.</p><p align="left">“That would be lovely, thank you.” Agatha said with a soft smile. “Can I come with you? I have nothing else to do, really.”</p><p align="left">Rio blushed at that—for several reasons. The way Agatha was looking at her with those unreadable, mysterious lakes of blue. The way Agatha looked like an ethereal being, her thick brown hair tossed up in a bun, making her face even more captivating, if that was even possible.</p><p align="left">And also because of those goddamn shorts she was wearing.</p><p align="left">“Yes, of course.” Rio finally managed, turning away, leading the way to the kitchen with Agatha following closely behind.</p><p align="left">Agatha was sitting. Watching.</p><p align="left">Staring at every motion Rio made, every sway, every step, every subtle expression.</p><p align="left">She sipped her coffee, never breaking her gaze. Rio would catch Agatha staring from time to time, but she was always the first to look away as heat would crawl up her neck while Agatha remained staring brazenly.</p><p align="left">“You look beautiful.” Agatha murmured, taking another sip of her coffee.</p><p align="left">Rio's hands froze mid-motion.</p><p align="left">“Do you always look this beautiful at this time of the morning?” Agatha asked, setting her cup down on the counter. She took a step closer, wetting her lips. And Rio? She remained silent. Her was heart racing violently in her chest.</p><p align="left">“May I?” Agatha asked, her gaze lowering to Rio's hips, asking for permission to hold her.</p><p align="left">Rio wasn't entirely sure what she meant—where exactly Agatha was looking—but she nodded anyway after swallowing hard.</p><p align="left">Agatha's hands found Rio's hips, and she pulled Rio closer. Their eyes locked, and the air between them grew heavier, charged with something neither of them dared to name.</p><p align="left">“You didn't answer me,” Agatha said, gently stroking Rio's cheekbone with the back of her hand.</p><p align="left">“...What?” Rio asked hesitantly.</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled, her gaze dipping to Rio's lips, lingering there. “Do you always look this beautiful in the morning?”</p><p align="left">“I—I don't know?” Rio stammered hesitantly as heat only increased.</p><p align="left">“Yeah?” Agatha mused. “I think it's a yes. Because... you always look so beautiful. Anytime. Anywhere.”</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed once again as Agatha's eyes met hers. Her pulse hammering so hard she was certain Agatha could hear it.</p><p align="left">The intensity of the moment became unbearable, so Rio did the only thing she could. </p><p align="left">She leaned in and crashed her lips into Agatha's. The kiss was heated, filled with hunger. Agatha's mouth took hers completely, devouring her with a fervor that sent shivers down her spine.</p><p align="left">Agatha's grip on her hips tightened. She walked Rio backward until her back hit the counter.</p><p align="left">Their tongues tangling, their bodies pressed so close.</p><p align="left">Agatha's knee slid between Rio's, pressing firmly against her core. She pulled back slightly, searching Rio's eyes to make sure this was what she wanted.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't hesitate, she only whined at the friction, burying her face in Agatha's shoulder to press the knee harder on her core, chasing more. A filthy moan escaped her lips as she fought the urge to bite down on Agatha's shoulder. </p><p align="left">The sound sent a spark through Agatha, igniting something deeper. She started moving her knee in a slow, deliberate circles, the pressure hitting just right against Rio's clit, pulling louder, needier moans from her mouth.</p><p align="left">“I know I haven't taken you on a date yet, but <em>god</em>, Rio...” </p><p align="left">Agatha murmured closely against Rio's ear, her voice low, slutry, so devastatingly seductive that it made Rio's entire body shudder.</p><p align="left">“Fuck. <em>Please</em>... more.” Rio whined.</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled her knee away, and before Rio could protest, Agatha's hands gripped her hips, claiming her mouth in a kiss just as heated as the moment before. This time, Agatha took a few steps back, guiding their bodies toward the kitchen island.</p><p align="left">With effortless strength, she lifted Rio's body onto the counter. Rio gasped, eyes widening as a moan slipped from her mouth.</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't give her a chance to recover of whatever the fuck had just happened. She crashed their lips together again, taking Rio on another desperate, hungry ride, making her squirm and moan, pulling out the most heated melodies out of her throat.</p><p align="left">Rio's legs instinctively wrapped around Agatha's hips, pulling her closer and keeping her there. </p><p align="left">As their tongues tangled, Agatha's hand slipped beneath Rio's shorts and underwear, fingers disappearing into the heat between her thighs. She groaned onto Rio's mouth at what she found, warmth, wetness and silk.</p><p align="left">Rio's body trembled as Agatha's cold fingers stroked her, teasing, exploring. And fuck, the coldness of Agatha's thumb ring was scolding on her heat.</p><p align="left">The moment Agatha's long digits found that sensitive bundle of nerves, Rio let out a cry—almost a scream—her senses drowning in the overwhelming pleasure Agatha's touches provided. Desire was resting at the tips of every corner of her body, waiting the right touch to explode and flood her. Rio could sense how close she was and Agatha seemed to feel it as well. The way Rio's body tensed, the way her breath hitched, she was <em>close</em>.</p><p align="left">So Agatha didn't stop, she pressed two fingers inside Rio's entrance, easing inside, filling her, stretching her. She paused for a second, waiting for Rio to adjust before she began moving, thrusting. Each stroke hitting just the right spot. Each motion drawing Rio closer to the edge, making her moan louder than ever.</p><p align="left">“I'd love to see you naked right on this kitchen island...” Agatha whispered between open-mouthed kisses, her voice was a slow burn against Rio's lips. Her fingers moved faster, her thumb circling Rio's clit on a rhythm. “But <em>fuck</em>...” She kissed her again, deep and consuming. “I can wait,” another kiss. “I can fucking wait to see all of you.”</p><p align="left">Rio clung to Agatha's shoulders, her legs locked around her hips. Her body was trembling under the pressure of what was building inside her.</p><p align="left">And then, her release tore through her, she came all over Agatha's fingers, shaking and falling apart in her arms, burying her face in the warmth of the crook of Agatha's neck as desire consumed her whole.</p><p align="left">“Oh my... <em>fuck</em>, <em>Agatha</em>.” Rio gasped, barely able to form any words.</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't stop, her fingers only slowed, riding out the aftershocks, letting Rio feel every second of it.</p><p align="left">When she finally withdrew her fingers, Rio sat back, breathless.</p><p align="left">Agatha met her gaze and without breaking the eye contact, she brought her fingers to her mouth and sucked them clean.</p><p align="left">“That's my breakfast.” she said with a smirk before leaning in, capturing Rio's mouth once again.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her for a moment once Agatha pulled away, and smiled. This time, she pulled Agatha closer, her legs tightening around her waist and captured Agatha's lips in a deep heated kiss.</p><p align="left">“God, that was...” She trailed off, words failing her. Instead, she leaned in again, letting the kiss say what she couldn't.</p><p align="left">Once she had fully recovered, her feet found the ground, though their lips refused to part for long, so they met again.</p><p align="left">“God, Rio, what are you doing to me?” Agatha murmured, pressing a soft kiss to Rio's head.</p><p align="left">“What am I doing to you?” Rio teased, a smirk playing on her lips.</p><p align="left">Agatha pinned her by the hips once again, their eyes locked. She leaned in, inhaling Rio's scent before pressing a kiss to her neck, sucking the sensitive skin. Rio moaned, tilting her head to the side, offering more.</p><p align="left">“You're driving me crazy,” Agatha admitted, the words landing directly in Rio's ear, sending a shiver to run down her spine.</p><p align="left">After a fair amount of kissing and sucking, Agatha pulled back and gave Rio's hips a gentle squeeze.</p><p align="left">Rio's hands flew up to cling on Agatha's neck. Their bodies flush against each other.</p><p align="left">“Can I?” Rio asked, looking directly into the oceanic depths of Agatha's eyes.</p><p align="left">“What, angel?” Agatha murmured, their noses brushing.</p><p align="left">“Touch you,” Rio said, blushing, her voice was barely above a whisper.</p><p align="left">Agatha pressed her body closer, her hips flush against Rio's, and the contact pulled an involuntary, soft moan from Rio's throat.</p><p align="left">“You can... but not now.” Agatha said as she tucked a strand of hair behind Rio's ear and her other hand moved slowly to cup Rio's ass cheek, their hips still pinned against each other.</p><p align="left">“Can you wait for me, angel?” Agatha whispered, “Hmm?” She hummed in question as she looked into Rio's eyes, heat radiating from the proximity. </p><p align="left">“Yes. I can,” Rio said, closing her eyes, feeling Agatha's lingering touches on her body.</p><p align="left">“Good girl,” Agatha praised, before capturing her lips once more.</p><p align="left">And they ate the eggs and bacon after all.</p>

<br/>
<em>How can I make it okay?</em>
<br/>
<em>Nothing else is as important as that to me</em>
</p><hr/><p align="left">Once Agatha had stepped out of Rio's place after kissing her goodbye, it was as if she had disappeared completely—without a trace, without a phone call, a text, or anything. Four days had passed, and there wasn't a single sign of her.</p><p align="left">Agatha, who had came to Rio's house in the middle of the night straight from the airport.</p><p align="left">Agatha, who seemed like she couldn't control herself around Rio.</p><p align="left">Agatha, who had promised she'd come back.</p><p align="left">And then, she just vanished into thin air. As if she had never been there in the first place.</p><p align="left">The past four days had been a hell for Rio. Nothing occupied her mind but Agatha. Day and night, awake or asleep, nothing but Agatha. Her stupid, beautiful face and that goddamn breathtaking smile.</p><p align="left">Was that it? Was that all she wanted? To fuck Rio senseless and make her weak? To crave herself into Rio's heart and then disappear, leaving only the imprint of her touch?</p><p align="left">Rio had her fair share of women acting reckless for a while, then suddenly feeling guilty or whatever and disappearing. But Agatha wasn't like that, was she? She wasn't reckless. She didn't even hesitate. She knew exactly what she was doing from the moment she locked eyes with Rio across that room. She wasn't playing games, she wasn't having fun by making Rio squirm every time they were close.</p><p align="left">Or was she?</p><p align="left">The more Rio thought about it, the worse her headache became—the same headache that plagued her for three damned days.</p><p align="left">She stared down at the papers on her desk, but none of it made any sense. She couldn't process a single thing. The only thing in her head was <em>Agatha</em>.</p><p align="left">Goddamn Agatha and her gorgeous blue eyes. Her fascinating sharp nose. Her cheekbones and jaw, her full, delicious lips. Her slender, long fingers...</p><p align="left">Rio squeezed her eyes shut the moment her mind started drifting to the wrong places. Thinking about the way Agatha's mouth tasted. The way her unapologeitc gaze pierced through Rio. The way she lifted her with ease, placing her exactly where she wanted. The way her fingers felt inside her...</p><p align="left">Oh no. Not there. </p><p align="left">Rio had reached out first, sent messages, called—but no answer. Not a single one. She even considered asking Lilia, but she knew that was a bad idea. She wasn't in that place yet, hell, she didn't even know where the fuck her place was.</p><p align="left">Rio was desperate. She just wanted to hear her voice. That voice could heal the wounds her absence had caused.</p><p align="left">Rio was painfully aware of how hard she had fallen for Agatha, and <em>god</em>, it was torturous. And she couldn't do a damn thing about it. </p><p align="left">She was supposed to be past this—past the stupid games her heart wanted to play. Years ago, she had decided she would never fall into its traps again. She would dismiss it every time. If she couldn't control it, she could at least ignore it.</p><p align="left">But here she was, sitting in her office chair, mind in disarray, heart pounding with fear—not just of what would happen next, but worse, of what wouldn't.</p><p align="left">She let the pen slip from her fingers and tossed it onto the stack of papers in front of her. Leaning back, she covered her face with both hands, trying in vain to suppress the goddamn headache.</p><p align="left">Nothing was working. And she was a fool. </p><p align="left">She couldn't help but feel like a teenage girl with a stupid crush, waiting for a message so she could grin at it like an idiot.</p><p align="left">What was it with her luck? Something had to be wrong. Was Rio really the kind of person who scared people away? Who made them disappear? But god, Agatha wasn't just people, and Rio knew it. </p><p align="left">That was why she still had hope. That was why she knew Agatha would come back at some point. <em>Maybe tomorrow</em>, and she'd have an excuse, one Rio would accept without question.</p><p align="left">Because if it was Agatha, she'd accept anything. Honestly, she was down so bad. Down on her knees for that woman. The woman she had only spent time with by chance. The woman she kept meeting in strange coincidences, without any planning. </p><p align="left">Every time they met, the world seemed to shrink. As if nothing else existed. No other places. No other people. Just them. And those damn unexplained coincidences.</p><p align="left">Rio could feel her head pulsing everywhere, and she was aware that she looked like shit. She hadn't gotten much sleep lately—when did she ever get the rest her body needed anyway? </p><p align="left">She pushed the chair forward, trying to get back to the work in her hands—the work she couldn't even focus on, no matter how hard she tried.</p><p align="left">Another day passed, and nothing from Agatha.</p><p align="left">
<em>Maybe tomorrow?</em>
</p><p align="left">And another.</p><p align="left">
<em>Maybe tomorrow?</em>
</p><p align="left">It had been a week.</p><p align="left">There was <em>no</em> tomorrow.</p><p align="left">Rio had spent every <em>maybe tomorrow</em> she had in her pockets, none were left.</p><p align="left">And yet, when she woke up this morning, she still found herself looking at the messages she had sent to Agatha over the past few days.</p><p align="left">
<em>Hey gorgeous. Are you free tomorrow?</em>
</p><p align="left">
<em>Hi, Agatha. Are you alright?</em>
</p><p align="left">
<em>Where are you? Is everything okay?</em>
</p><p align="left">
<em>Did something happen to you?</em>
</p><p align="left">
<em>God, Agatha, where are you? Please, can you just talk to me?</em>
</p><p align="left">Again, Rio was <em>desperate</em>. </p><p align="left">And that woman, despite her absence, kept growing inside her. Kept taking up space. Kept living in her—even though Rio wasn't watering her memory. Even though no sunlight reached the depths Agatha had buried herself in.</p><p align="left">So how? How did she keep growing and growing? And why did Rio still have so much hope that Agatha would return? To the point that hope inside her had already begun creating yet another <em>maybe tomorrow</em>.</p><p align="left">So... <em>maybe tomorrow</em>.</p><p align="left">Rio got up. It was Monday again. She had to face the world again, make small talks with people, even though every word left a nauseating sensation in her stomach—one she'd only purge at the end of the day when she'd vomit herself out.</p><p align="left">It was strange how one couldn't control oneself. No matter the effort put into taming a wild heart. Something always came out of nowhere to shatter it. To leave open wounds that will eventually scar.</p><p align="left">Agatha never had to speak to Rio in the first place. She shouldn't have. They weren't together, after all. They hadn't even gone on a proper date. </p><p align="left">And yet, the question lingered in Rio's mind.</p><p align="left">Why? Why would someone go through all that effort just to walk away? Without a single word?</p><p align="left">Did Agatha expect Rio to use her memory, her promises, to fill the space her absence had left?</p><p align="left">Nonsense.</p><p align="left">Rio wasn't great at communicating, that much she knew. But she still knew when to talk, what to say and why.</p><p align="left">She had spent her whole life making sure she never did to others what had been done to her. She had put herself last just to avoid affecting people the way they had affected her. She knew the weight a word could hold. The pain an action could cause. And she never wanted to be the reason of any of it.</p><p align="left">She washed her face. In the process, she glanced at her reflection, at the dark circles under her eyes. No amount of makeup would hide those properly.</p><p align="left">She got dressed for the long day ahead, grabbed her things, and stepped out.</p><hr/><p align="left">As the day came to an end, she gathered her stuff and headed outside. She was expecting a call from Alice, so when her phone vibrated in her pocket, she pulled it out and brought it to her ear without looking at it.</p><p align="left">“Hey, Alice, I'm heading home—”</p><p align="left">“<em>Rio</em>...”</p><p align="left">The voice made Rio froze mid-step. People passed by her, unaware of what a single voice had just done to her.</p><p align="left">She swallowed hard. Her breath turned unsteady. A panic attack was forming inside her.</p><p align="left">She thought she'd be glad to hear that voice again, but now? Now she was terrified of what was coming.</p><p align="left">Rio said nothing, not for a solid twenty seconds.</p><p align="left">“First of all,” Agatha began, “I'm really sorry, Rio...”</p><p align="left">“What do you want, Agatha?” Rio's question wasn't sharp. Wasn't edged. It was soft, barely above a whisper.</p><p align="left">“Can I see you?”</p><p align="left">“Why?” Rio asked, resuming her walk. “Why do you want to see me?” </p><p align="left">“I could explain... if you let me. And if you don't want to, I'd understand.”</p><p align="left">“Explain what, Agatha?”</p><p align="left">“God, Rio, please don't talk to me like that.”  Agatha's voice was hurt. It was obvious. And by the gods, how it pained Rio.</p><p align="left">As if she could feel her insides bleeding from the stab Agatha's voice had caused.</p><p align="left">“Like what?” Rio whispered. “I'm just asking, Agatha.”</p><p align="left">Agatha was silent for a while, and that made Rio walk faster toward her car. She slid in and closed the door, then exhaled a breath she hadn't even realized she'd been holding.</p><p align="left">“Can I see you? Please, just say yes or no. I'll answer any question you have.”</p><p align="left">As Agatha said that, a tear ran down Rio's face, resting at the edge of her chin. She wiped it away with the back of her hand.</p><p align="left">“Yeah, okay.”</p><p align="left">“Okay?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah.” Rio said as she started the engine. “Ah—I'm heading home now. Can you come to my place? If that's okay? I don't really have the urge to go out... if that's okay with you?” </p><p align="left">“Yes... Yes, of course. I'll be there.”</p><p align="left">“Great. See you then.”</p><p align="left">She ended the call and exhaled a deep shaky breath. Her eyes started producing the tears she despised. She couldn't cry, at least not here. </p><p align="left">But <em>god</em>, that voice. The weight behind Agatha's tone, something hidden, something carefully concealed, yet despite Agatha's efforts of hidding it, Rio heard it, and it hurt.</p><p align="left">A knock on the window jolted her from her thoughts.</p><p align="left">Alice.</p><p align="left">She was holding her phone to her ear, pointing at it. Rio glanced at her own phone and saw Alice's name flashing on the screen. She lowered the window.</p><p align="left">“Hey, why didn't you pick up?”</p><p align="left">“I was calling someone.”</p><p align="left">Alice studied her for a moment, and Rio felt exposed. Embarrassed.</p><p align="left">“Are you alright?”</p><p align="left">“Yes, I am. Just tired. Long day.” Rio forced the best smile she could muster.</p><p align="left">“Okay... You still up for tonight, yeah?”</p><p align="left">“About that... I don't think I'll be able to come. You guys go ahead without me, I have something to do.”</p><p align="left">“What is it, Rio?”</p><p align="left">“Nothing, really, Alice. I just have to meet someone, that's all.”</p><p align="left">“And that ‘<em>someone</em>’ happens to be Agatha Harkness?”</p><p align="left">Rio's eyes widened. Damn you Alice!</p><p align="left">“No! Why would you say that?? Why would I meet Agatha?”</p><p align="left">Rio tried to sound as defensive as possible.</p><p align="left">“Rio, sweetheart...” Alice looked like she was about to say something else, but at the last second, she changed her mind. Instead, she smiled—that bright, knowing smile of hers.</p><p align="left">“Nothing. Just take care, okay?”</p><p align="left">“Okay. You too.”</p><p align="left">Rio drove home and her mind was a mess.</p><p align="left">What would she do once she saw Agatha? What would she say? What would Agatha say? What would they do?</p><p align="left">So many whats, yet nothing was clear. She'd catch an idea, and the next second she'd dismiss it.</p><p align="left">She had no idea how to handle situations like this one. And it was stupid—so, so stupid—to ask Agatha to come to her place, to be alone with her.</p><p align="left">She should have suggested a restaurant. A goddamn bar. Somewhere crowded, somewhere where she could focus on anything other than Agatha.</p><p align="left">But honestly... Would she even focus on anything else if Agatha was there? No. That was one of the impossible things in the world. Because even in her absence, Rio hadn't been able to focus on anything else.</p><p align="left">Who was she kidding? No one but herself.</p><p align="left">Rio arrived at the discomfort of her depressing house.</p><p align="left">She hung up her coat, kicked off her shoes near the door, then headed straight to the liquor cabinet. A glass of wine would help her relax a little before Agatha's arrival.</p><p align="left">She lay on the couch, a glass in hand, feeling her muscles loosen slightly as she let herself sink into the cushions. She stared at the ceiling for minutes. Voices in her head whispered. Suggested things. The clothes on her body felt uncomfortable, these jeans weren't made for lounging.</p><p align="left">So she got up, took a sip of wine, and went upstairs to change into something more comfortable. When she came back, she sat in the same spot on the couch, waiting.</p><p align="left"><em>Waiting</em>.</p><p align="left">Minutes passed and there was no sign of Agatha.</p><p align="left">They hadn't agreed on a specific time. Should she send a message? No.</p><p align="left">She'd be here any minute. Or any hour.</p><p align="left">Half an hour passed.</p><p align="left">Rio hated waiting. No, she <em>despised</em> it. Especially waiting without knowing. </p><p align="left">She rose to her feet and poured herself another glass of wine. Agatha would get here whenever she wanted.</p><p align="left">And Rio...</p><p align="left">Had to pretend she wasn't waiting impatiently. Like lava wasn't running through her veins. Like she wasn’t on the verge of erupting.</p><p align="left">As she finished the second glass and was about to pour a third, a knock on the door snapped her attention away. She looked up while setting the glass down on the table.</p><p align="left">She tried not to hurry her steps, but the anticipation was agonizing.</p><p align="left">Taking a deep breath, she placed her hand on the door handle and opened it. </p><p align="left">The first thing she saw was Agatha's blue eyes—then the darkness beneath them.</p><p align="left">“Hi,” Agatha greeted, her voice was low.</p><p align="left">“Hi. Come on in.”</p><p align="left">Rio stepped aside, and Agatha walked in.</p><p align="left">No warm embrace. No kiss. No anything.</p><p align="left">Rio forced herself to stay calm, to suppress the burning inside her, the longing, the ache of seeing that beautiful face after a week, the pain of witnessing the exhaustion in those delicate features.</p><p align="left">Agatha walked a few steps then she froze in her motion. Rio closed the door, then walked toward the couch. </p><p align="left">Agatha didn't follow.</p><p align="left">“Come, sit.” Rio said, eyes fixed on Agatha's face, searching, but finding nothing.</p><p align="left">“Rio... I'm sorry.” Agatha finally said, standing still in her place. “I know it's been a week, but I really was busy. With so much. I'm not trying to justify ghosting you. I just... I just want to let you know.” </p><p align="left">Rio remained standing near the couch, neither sitting nor moving.</p><p align="left">“You could have said something. Sent a message. Anything.”  Her voice was soft. Her eyes were still on Agatha, who for some reason, refused to meet Rio's.</p><p align="left">And Rio didn't like that. It made her heart tighten.</p><p align="left">“No. I couldn't.” Agatha murmured.</p><p align="left">“You couldn't call me? Respond to one of my messages?” Rio's tone rose slightly, she couldn't control it.</p><p align="left">“No.”</p><p align="left">“Why?”</p><p align="left">Agatha still wasn't looking at Rio. She looked everywhere but at her eyes.</p><p align="left">“Agatha, Look at me.” Rio stepped closer.</p><p align="left">Agatha remained still. Frozen, not a single motion, as if something unseen held her in place. She was silent, like she wanted to speak but couldn't.</p><p align="left">Rio inched forward, putting enough space between them. Space she had forced herself to keep. Because if it were up to her? She would embrace Agatha right here. Hold her as tightly as she could. Shower her with kisses and every feeling she had for the woman standing before her.</p><p align="left">Then, after what felt like forever, Agatha finally looked at her.</p><p align="left">And god, her eyes. Something in that gaze struck Rio's heart. Pain. Guilt. Something more, something Rio couldn't even name.</p><p align="left">“I—I wasn't here.” Agatha's voice was barely above a whisper. “I was in Paris this past week. I had something important to do there. I wanted to call you, but I couldn't.” Agatha said, looking directly into Rio's eyes. “It's still not an excuse for disappearing for a week. And I'm sorry Rio, I really am.”</p><p align="left">Rio felt panic building inside her with every word. What had kept Agatha so busy? What had made her look so tired?</p><p align="left">She tried to stay calm, even as the panic clawed at her insides, threatening to drag her under. </p><p align="left">She swallowed hard, ignoring the ache twisting inside her as she cleared her throat. But her heart was pounding too fast and her stomach was burning.</p><p align="left">“It's okay.” She heard herself, she knew how she sounded, but she tried not to focus on it. She tried not to focus on the pain growing inside her the longer she looked at Agatha.</p><p align="left">God, if she were alone, she might have been able to deal with this.</p><p align="left">But she wasn't.</p><p align="left">Her head spun and the room tilted. She squeezed her eyes shut, and the next second she felt fingertips brushing against her cheekbone.</p><p align="left">“Rio, are you okay?” Agatha's voice was laced with concern. Her thumb was stroking so gently, so <em>beautifully</em>.</p><p align="left">“Yes... yes, I am.” Rio said as she opened her eyes, forcing a faint, artificial smile onto her face.</p><p align="left">The next second, the overwhelming weight crashed down on her. The pain of the past week caught up all at once. Her breathing turned unsteady, she couldn't get enough oxygen into her lungs, and the next thing she knew, she was on her knees, struggling to breathe.</p><p align="left">“Rio, are you okay? Talk to me.”</p><p align="left">Agatha dropped to the floor beside her, panic lacing her voice. But Rio couldn't respond, she couldn't even process what Agatha was saying. Her head spun like a goddamn wheel out of control. Her vision blurred, black spots floated in front of her eyes. The lack of oxygen was suffocating her.</p><p align="left">She felt Agatha's hands on her shoulders. She heard her voice, thick with concern, but the words, she couldn't understand them.</p><p align="left">“Rio, can you hear me? Baby, please say something.”</p><p align="left">Her head hung low, staring at nothing. Before she could fall completely, Agatha pulled her close, holding Rio's weak body against her chest.</p><p align="left">Trying to soothe her, to chase the panic away.</p><p align="left">Rio's head rested on Agatha's chest while her torso lay against her body. </p><p align="left">Agatha embraced her tightly, one hand stroking Rio's hair gently, the other rubbing slow circles on her back. Offering warmth and comfort. Offering herself.</p><p align="left">Agatha whispered words, soft and pleading, but Rio still couldn't hear them.</p><p align="left">“Come on Rio, please just breathe with me. You'll be okay.”</p><p align="left">This—</p><p align="left">This was the first sentence Rio was able to make out, she was regaining some consciousness. Some control over her body.</p><p align="left">“I'm here baby. I'm here. Just please breathe with me. <em>Please</em>.”</p><p align="left">Rio forced herself to follow Agatha's voice. Slow, deep breaths, one then another. Pulling oxygen into her lungs, to reach her brain and regain some balance.</p><p align="left">Agatha's hands never stopped moving, never left her. She kept stroking gently. Kept holding her, <em>grounding</em> her.</p><p align="left">A few seconds passed, and Rio's vision returned to normal. Her hearing sharpened. She could hear Agatha's heartbeat, loud and rapid, pounding right against her ear. She could feel Agatha's warmth. Smell her scent. Hear her again.</p><p align="left">“Can you please say something?” Agatha voice trembled, as if a sob was trapped in her throat.</p><p align="left">Rio wanted to speak, wanted to tell her she was okay, but the words wouldn't come. So she did the only thing she could do. She wrapped her arms around Agatha's waist and held onto her. It had to be uncomfortable for Agatha. Rio thought. Sitting on the floor, nearly lying on it, with Rio's body resting against hers.</p><p align="left">But the moment Rio held her, Agatha held her tighter. Pulling her even closer.</p><p align="left">“Keep breathing for me.”</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her head, burying her face in Agatha's neck, breathing in her scent—violet and warmth and <em>Agatha</em>. Breathing—exhaling warm breaths against her neck, so Agatha could feel her, to make sure Rio was okay with every breath. </p><p align="left">Seconds passed, then Rio slightly pulled away. Her eyes met Agatha's, those exhausted, beautiful, blue eyes.</p><p align="left">“Sorry about that.” This time, Rio managed a real smile.</p><p align="left">Agatha shifted, sitting on her heels. She reached out and cupped Rio's face with both hands. She tilted her head down, pressing a soft kiss to Rio's forehead.</p><p align="left">“<em>I'm sorry,</em>” A kiss to her closed eyes. “<em>I'm sorry,</em>” Her nose. “<em>I'm sorry,</em>” Her left cheek. “<em>I'm sorry.</em>” The right one.</p><p align="left">When Agatha finally met Rio's gaze, her eyes glistened, tears hanging like glass by the edges.</p><p align="left">Rio reached up, wanting to touch her. Wanting to tell her she didn't have to be sorry, but before she could speak, Agatha leaned in, whispering an “<em>I'm sorry</em>” near Rio's lips making her feel the warmth of it. Then Agatha kissed her. Tender. Sweet. Apologetic. Pouring everything into the kiss, every <em>I'm sorry</em> she couldn't say. Every <em>I'm sorry</em> Rio couldn't hear. The kiss lasted minutes. Maybe hours. And Rio wanted it to be an eternity.</p><p align="left">Then breathless, they pulled apart.</p><p align="left">Agatha stood first and reached her hands out, palms up, silently asking for Rio's hand.</p><p align="left">Rio placed her palm in Agatha's and she pulled her up gently. </p><p align="left">Once they were face-to-face, Agatha embraced her again—a tender, warm and safe embrace.</p><p align="left">Rio remained silent, only feeling the emotions Agatha was trying to make her feel, each one of them. Her head rested on Agatha's shoulder while their hands secured around each other's middles.</p><p align="left">After a couple of minutes, Rio kissed Agatha's covered shoulder, then she pulled back, their hands still resting on each other's hips as their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">“Do you wanna sit?” Rio asked, her voice was a low murmur.</p><p align="left">“Yes. But are you okay?”</p><p align="left">“I am now.”</p><p align="left">“Good,” Agatha said, her thumbs moving up and down on Rio's hips. “Can you tell me what happened? Hmm? It's okay if you don't want to.”</p><p align="left">“It's nothing, really. Just a panic attack, don't worry” </p><p align="left">One of Agatha's hands moved up to rest on Rio's face. “<em>I'm sorry.</em>” She whispered, looking into Rio's eyes.</p><p align="left">“Why are you apologizing?” Rio asked, tightening her hold on Agatha's hips.</p><p align="left">“Why not, angel?” Agatha's thumb stroked her cheek gently. “I should be sorry.”</p><p align="left">Rio closed her eyes, feeling Agatha's touch on her face and on her hip, even through the fabric.</p><p align="left">“Are you sure you're fine?”</p><p align="left">“Yes, I'm really fine now.” Rio leaned closer and kissed the apple of Agatha's cheek. “Let's sit?”</p><p align="left">She took Agatha's hand, and they sat on the couch.</p><p align="left">The situation between them now started to feel familiar, but the heat of it was growing. They gazed at each other for a while, until Agatha broke the silence before it stretched too long.</p><p align="left">“You look tired.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, the work never ends.” Rio tried to dismiss, but Agatha clearly wasn't satisfied with that response.</p><p align="left">“You haven't been sleeping, have you?”</p><p align="left">“I try to get just enough to get through the day.” Rio said with a smile. “You also look exhausted. Are you alright?”</p><p align="left">“I am, don't worry.”</p><p align="left">Minutes of silence settled between them. And it kept stretching.</p><p align="left">They only kept looking at each other—neither knowing what they were searching for in the other's features, neither knowing how to voice the words resting on the tips of their tongues. </p><p align="left">“What were you doing in Paris?” Rio asked, trying not to put any pressure on the question. Because she knew something had happened there, even if she didn't know what it exactly was.</p><p align="left">And her suspicion was confirmed by the shift in Agatha's expression.</p><p align="left">Agatha remained silent, but something flickered in her gaze. Rio stayed quiet too, waiting eagerly for Agatha to say something. But minutes passed, and still, <em>nothing</em>.</p><p align="left">Agatha opened her mouth, then shut it again, only looking at Rio with those tired blue eyes.</p><p align="left">“Can we talk about this later?”</p><p align="left">“Of course,” Rio said, tucking a strand of Agatha's dark hair behind her ear. “Whenever you want.” She looked into those enchanting blue lakes. “I'm gonna get us some water. Do you want anything else?”</p><p align="left">“No, water is fine. Thank you.”</p><p align="left">Rio got up to grab two bottles of water, then returned to find Agatha still sitting in the same place.</p><p align="left">Rio was worried. This was the first time she had seen her like this—pale and exhausted. She wanted to know what was going on inside Agatha's head, to know what was wrong and try to stitch the wounds. But at the same time, she didn't want to push. She knew what it felt like to be forced into something.</p><p align="left">But god, it hurt—watching those tired, beautiful features while being helpless to do anything.</p><p align="left">She handed Agatha the bottle and sat beside her, closer than before.</p><p align="left">“You should rest.” Rio said, watching as Agatha drank from the bottle.</p><p align="left">Agatha removed it from her mouth and closed it, a smirk appearing as she wiped the corners of her mouth with her fingers.</p><p align="left">
<em>What a sight...</em>
</p><p align="left">But Rio forced the thought away, focusing instead on figuring out why Agatha was smirking. </p><p align="left">“You're the one who should rest.”</p><p align="left">Rio narrowed her eyes. Then, her index finger moved slowly under Agatha's right eye.</p><p align="left">“Your beautiful eyes are tired.”</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled. “You're adorable, you know that?”</p><p align="left">Rio smiled as she kept moving her fingers gently.</p><p align="left">“If you don't want to rest, then can I run a bath for you? Then we could eat,” Rio said, her gaze was drifting to those full lips before returning to Agatha's eyes. “Hmm? I won't take no for an answer.”</p><p align="left">“Are you sure about that?”</p><p align="left">“Sure about what? Running you a bath so you can relax a little, then finally getting the chance to eat with you? Yes, I'm sure about that, Agatha.”</p><p align="left">Agatha seemed to hesitate, but Rio didn't let her. “Please don't overthink it.”</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled—a smile that reached all the way up to her eyes, and it was one of the most beautiful things Rio had ever seen.</p><p align="left">“Okay.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah,” Agatha said, and that smile didn't leave her beautiful face.</p><p align="left">Rio wanted to see it every day. To be reason behind it.</p><p align="left">She got up to prepare the bath while Agatha stood in the doorway. Rio could feel Agatha's eyes on her—how could she not?</p><p align="left">“Okay, so you have everything you need here. I'll put some clothes in the guest room, and if you need anything, just call me. I'll be in the room by the stairs.”</p><p align="left">As soon as Rio finished speaking, Agatha leaned in, their faces mere inches apart. She rested a hand on the back of Rio's neck, then kissed her soothingly, tasting her with tenderness, pouring so much love and gratitude into that kiss. And Rio felt it all, it was consuming her in the best way.</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled back slightly, “Thank you,” she whispered.</p><p align="left">Rio only smiled and kissed Agatha's lips again briefly, then she stepped outside and closed the door behind her.</p><p align="left">She grabbed one of her bands t-shirts, a pair of sweatpants and some decent shorts, leaving the decision to Agatha, along with a pair of new underwear. She placed them on the bed in the guest room and headed to the indoor garden.</p><p align="left">She sat among her plants, letting the quiet settle around her.</p><p align="left">Fifteen minutes passed, and a knock on the door made her smile.</p><p align="left">“Come on in.”</p><p align="left">Agatha stepped inside, and <em>god</em>—seeing Agatha in her t-shirt and shorts did something to her heart. Agatha's hair was tied up in a damp bun, and she looked relaxed, just as Rio had hoped. She stared at her for so long that she almost missed the amazed look on Agatha's face.</p><p align="left">“Which one is the main one?” Agatha asked, her gaze sweeping over the white-colored room. Green plants stretched from the ceiling to the floor, vases overflowing with greenery, floor-to-ceiling windows letting in streams of sunlight. Two small windows in the ceiling allowed some plants to spill through, creating a dreamy, living view. In the center sat a velvet green couch with a small table in front of it, a stack of books beside a bottle of wine and two glasses.</p><p align="left">Rio chuckled as she stood up.</p><p align="left">“I don't know, really. Both spaces are dear to me, so I can't decide.”</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled and kept wandering, her expression filled with wonder.</p><p align="left">Her eyes landed on the guitar leaning against the couch, and Rio noticed where her eyes drifted.</p><p align="left">“Do you play?” Agatha asked as she approached her.</p><p align="left">“You could say that. I haven't played in a long time.” Rio admitted, a faint blush coloring her cheeks.</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled as they sat down.</p><p align="left">“Aren't you full of surprises? Can you play something?”</p><p align="left">“If you want me to.”</p><p align="left">“Of course I do.”</p><p align="left">Rio laughed—Agatha was far too alluring.</p><p align="left">“Okay, but give me a minute to remember something I can play.”</p><p align="left">Agatha nodded, looking at Rio adoringly.</p><p align="left">“The last time I actually played was when I was a freshman in college.” Rio said, setting the guitar on her lap and holding it close to her body with both hands. “I used to be in a band with my friends in high school,” She chuckled as she tested the strings. “Now... You know, I only play for my plants.”</p><p align="left">She lifted her face to look at Agatha, and was completely flabbergasted by the way Agatha was looking at her. Her eyes were full of something Rio couldn't name or recognize, but she felt. It wrapped around her warmly. The way Agatha was smiling at her—completely dumbstruck.</p><p align="left">“A band?” Agatha said. “Go on.”</p><p align="left">Rio couldn't help but smile as warmth spread through her entire body. Agatha was paying attention to everything, looking at her as if she were something precious.</p><p align="left">“Yeah, a band. In highschool—me, Alice and two other lesbians.” </p><p align="left">Agatha laughed and the sound warmed Rio from the inside out. It was one of the sweetest sounds she had ever heard.</p><p align="left">“What was the band's name? Lesbians in High School?” Agatha teased, laughter still visible in her words.</p><p align="left">“Close. It was The Scissors.” </p><p align="left">“No way!”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, and if the school had known what it meant at the time, they wouldn't have let us play. But we were safe.”</p><p align="left">Their laughter blended together, warm and full. Rio looked at Agatha adoringly—she would never get enough of that sound. Those melodies of joy spilling from Agatha'sthroat that made Rio weak every single time.</p><p align="left">Rio cleared her throat and looked at Agatha once more before letting her gaze settle on the guitar.</p><p align="left">“It's a song called Who's Your Baby Now. I used to sing it a lot even though it wasn't really my—our genre.”</p><p align="left">“You're going to sing too?”</p><p align="left">Rio only smiled before she started playing, the rhythms were flowing effortlessly from her fingers, the lyrics coming from a place deep inside her—one she knew by heart.</p><p>
<em>The rock you stood upon, is broken up and gone</em>
<br/>
<em>Hey baby, who's your baby now?</em>
</p><p>
<em>On the slipway of your dream, stands someone else's scheme</em>
<br/>
<em>Hey baby, who's your baby now?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Your baby now, baby now</em>
<br/>
<em>Your baby now, baby now</em>
</p><p align="left">As she finished playing, she set the guitar aside and looked at Agatha—who was already looking at her.</p><p align="left">“So?”</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't say a word, as if no words could capture what was in her mind. Instead she leaned in and cupped Rio's face with both hands before crashing their lips together. The kiss was heated, urgent and necessary. Rio returned it with just as much heat, just as much fervor and yearning.</p><p align="left">She was the first to pull away, Agatha rested her forehead against Rio's.</p><p align="left">“I don't think I'll ever get enough of this.”</p><p align="left">Rio smiled and kissed Agatha again—not as heated as before, but just as sweet as the moment itself.</p><p align="left">A few minutes passed before Rio spoke. “Should we order something to eat? Do you want anything in particular?”</p><p align="left">“Not really, I'll get whatever you get.”</p><p align="left">“Well, I know a place that makes the best pizza around here.”</p><p align="left">“Pizza it is.”</p><p align="left">They went downstairs to wait for the food's arrival. Rio couldn't help but notice the slight distance in Agatha's expression, something was going on inside her head—and Rio just wanted to steal her from her thoughts, even if just for a little while.</p><p align="left">She reached out, placed her hand on Agatha's and looked at her. That seemed to pull Agatha back, and their eyes met for what felt like the hundredth time in the past few hours. </p><p align="left">“So, have you finished that painting?” Rio asked, smirking with excitement.</p><p align="left">“Actually, yes,” Agatha replied with a smile.</p><p align="left">“Yeah? Have you changed my nose, though?”</p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her, that smile was back again on her face. “I did,” She said, her index finger tracing the bridge of Rio's nose down to the tip. Her gaze dropped to Rio's mouth for a second before returning to her eyes.</p><p align="left">The smirk on Rio's face didn't fade—if anything, it only grew wider. She started leaning in but a knock on the door made her pause.</p><p align="left">With the brightest grin, Rio got up to grab their food. She brought the boxes inside and set them on the dining table, then went to call Agatha—who was standing in front of a painting hanging above the couch.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't say anything, she only watched her in silence.</p><p align="left">Agatha studied the painting intently, looking at it closely. Rio couldn't help but smile the moment Agatha stood on the tip of her toes, her fingers touched it gently, feeling it.</p><p align="left">Rio stepped closer, and Agatha straightened up, turning to face her.</p><p align="left">“This is the only painting in your house.”</p><p align="left">“The only one with a spot on a wall.” Rio corrected with a small smile as she stoof beside Agatha and stared at the painting. “It's my mother's.”</p><p align="left">Agatha's head snapped toward her so fast that Rio felt it before she saw it.</p><p align="left">“Your mother? Who is she?”</p><p align="left">Rio held Agatha's gaze for a second before looking back at the painting, her arms instinctively folding closer to her middle </p><p align="left">“Lucía Vidal. She wasn't famous or anything—she only painted in her free time. It was just a hobby, a way to connect with herself.” Rio smiled softly as she resumed. “She once told me ‘Not everything should be out and shared with the world mija. Some things must remain hidden inside so we can enjoy them fully, for the reasons we created them, without any disturbance from the outside.’ Even though my father always tried convincing her to sell her artwork, she never did.”</p><p align="left">Rio's voice softened as she recalled her mother's words and the bright smile was still on her face, but despite that, a tear betrayed her, slipping silently down her cheek. </p><p align="left">For a moment, neither of them spoke. Then Rio felt the back of Agatha's hand brushing against her face gently, wiping away the stray tear that was resting on her chin. </p><p align="left">“She's good.” Agatha murmured.</p><p align="left">“Yeah, she was.” Rio said, still smiling as she turned to look at Agatha. “Come on, let's eat.”</p><p align="left">They ate as they made small talks, sharing little details here and there.</p><p align="left">Rio was finishing what was left in her glass of wine when Agatha spoke.</p><p align="left">“I should go now.”</p><p align="left">Rio's eyes widened instantly as she lifted her head up to look at her. </p><p align="left">“No, you shouldn't. You could stay here,” she said, trying to mask the disappointment that was creeping into her voice.</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled as she rose from her chair. “Rio, you've done enough already.”</p><p align="left">Rio didn't say anything for a moment. She just stared at the glass on the table, fighting the urge to say something she might regret later. Instead, she mirrored Agatha's movement and stood up as well.</p><p align="left">“Okay, I'll get your stuff,” Rio said, struggling to meet Agatha's gaze.</p><p align="left">But before she could take a step, she felt Agatha's fingers wrap around her wrist. </p><p align="left">She turned to look at her, searching her face, but Rio couldn't quite place the look in Agatha's eyes—like she wanted to say something but couldn't. Rio waited, a full two minutes passed in silence, but Agatha still didn't speak. She didn't utter a single word, only their heavy breaths were filling the silence .</p><p align="left">So, gently, Rio removed Agatha's grip from her wrist and forced a smile onto her face.</p><p align="left">“I'll get them for you.”</p><p align="left">She went upstairs and sat on the bed in the guest room for a moment. Agatha's clothes were folded in her hands. But before she could fully process her thoughts, she heard footsteps. She lifted her gaze up and saw Agatha standing in the doorway.</p><p align="left">Rio got up immediately and handed her the clothes, but the moment Agatha took them, she let them slip from her grasp, dropping them onto the floor. Then she reached for Rio's hand—the same hand that had just given her the clothes—and pulled her closer. Their lips crashed together and the taste of wine lingered between them. </p><p align="left">Rio was completely lost in the kiss, but then, suddenly, she pulled back. She needed to see Agatha—needed to look at her. Rio so desperately wanted to understand.</p><p align="left">She stared at Agatha for a few long, silent seconds—and god, the silence was unbearable.</p><p align="left">Just as Rio parted her lips to speak, Agatha guided Rio's hand to her hip.</p><p align="left">“<em>You wanted to touch me. Then touch me.</em>”  Agatha's voice was low, thick with need and hesitation.</p><p align="left">For another second, Rio simply just stared at Agatha, then her other hand rested on her other hip. She pulled her in, pressing their bodies together and kissed her again—fervently, hungrily.</p><p align="left">The moment Agatha's lips parted slightly, Rio's tongue slipped inside, deepening the kiss. She tilted her head to the side—desperate to taste more, to feel more.</p><p align="left">The moan that escaped Agatha's throat made Rio dig her fingers deeper into her hips, pulling her impossibly closer. Their bodies were flush against each other.</p><p align="left">They broke apart briefly—ten seconds to catch their breath—then their lips met again, their tongues tangling with renewed urgency.</p><p align="left">Rio started moving them backward. Once they stepped outside the room, their lips parted again.</p><p align="left">“Bedroom,” Rio said, breathless. </p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her, then captured her mouth again with hunger and lust. They kept kissing, touching, pressing into each other until they reached the room.</p><p align="left">Rio pushed the door open with her back, then maneuvered Agatha's body by her hips, guiding her onto the king sized-bed.</p><p align="left">Their lips parted. Rio stood straight, peeling off her t-shirt. Once it was off her body and over her head she looked at Agatha—who was propping up on her elbows, her chest rising and falling rapidly. The blueness of her eyes was almost entirely swallowed by the darkness of her lust. Rio leaned in and kissed her briefly before straightening again.</p><p align="left">Then she unclasped her bra, sliding the straps off her shoulders, letting the fabric fall somewhere onto the floor.</p><p align="left">She stepped closer, capturing Agatha's lips once more as she motioned for her to lie her body completely on the bed. Agatha obeyed, resting her head on Rio's pillows.</p><p align="left">Rio was on top of her, kissing every part of Agatha's face she could plant a kiss on, savoring the warmth of her skin beneath her lips.</p><p align="left">Then she whispered in Agatha's ear, her voice was thick with desire.</p><p align="left">“I didn't tell you how goddamn beautiful you look wearing my clothes.”</p><p align="left">She kissed and sucked her neck, and the whimpers escaping Agatha's lips made Rio's body burn with arousal.</p><p align="left">One of Agatha's palms cupped Rio's breast, and Rio moaned against Agatha's neck at the contact. Agatha traced slow, invisible circles around her nipple, sending shivers swirling through Rio's body.</p><p align="left">Rio leaned back to look at Agatha before gripping the hem of the t-shirt and lifted it above her body.</p><p align="left">She leaned in again, kissing her throat, her collarbones and the exposed skin of her heaving chest. Rio cupped Agatha's breasts over the piece of fabric that was still covering her skin, sucking and kissing, leaving hickeys on that pale skin.</p><p align="left">After a moment, Rio reached to unclasp Agatha's bra. As she pulled the straps off, she was met with a breathtaking sight—those gorgeous, perfect breasts. Rio looked at Agatha who was already watching her. She cupped both breasts in her hands, her thumbs teasing each nipple—pressing firmly then, gently, then firmly again. Her eyes were locked onto Agatha's face, studying every expression that flickered across it.</p><p align="left">After a few seconds, she lowered her mouth, enveloping one hardned nipple, sucking, kissing and circling it with her tongue while her hand continued teasing the other.</p><p align="left">She pulled back, admiring her work—the glistening trail of her saliva on Agatha's rosy nipple—before leaning in to give the other one the same attention.</p><p align="left">“Rio, put that mouth where I need it,” Agatha pleaded, her voice was thick with need.</p><p align="left">Rio only smirked and continued her work on Agatha's breasts, worshipping them properly. Then She sat up, leaning closer to Agatha's face, their lips were a breath apart. </p><p align="left">“Patience,” Rio murmured before she placed a soft kiss on Agatha's swollen lips.</p><p align="left">She kissed her way down Agatha's abdomen, gripping the waistband of her shorts and underwear and sliding them down in one smooth motion. </p><p align="left">Rio's gaze lingered on that c–section scar just above Agatha's pubic bone. She stared at it for a second too long then she leaned in and kissed it.</p><p align="left">She placed both hands on the inside of Agatha's thighs and gently spread them, positioning herself between Agatha's legs. The sight of Agatha's dripping cunt sent a shiver through her as she felt herself getting more wet with every passing second.</p><p align="left">Rio pressed soft kisses to the inside of Agatha's thigh as her index and middle fingers slid up and down her slit, drawing a low, heated moan from Agatha's throat that made Rio's breath get caught in her throat.</p><p align="left">Applying just enough pressure, Rio pressed her thumb against the throbbing clit, making Agatha's entire body tremble. She took one of Agatha's legs and draped it over her shoulder to give herself better access. As she did, two of her fingers slipped inside Agatha's leaking cunt with ease.</p><p align="left">“<em>Ah, fuck. Rio—</em>”</p><p align="left">Rio started thrusting, her fingers moving in and out, finding the spot that made Agatha moan the most delicious sounds.</p><p align="left">A second later, her mouth replaced her thumb, her lips and tongue lavishing attention on Agatha's clit while her fingers continued their rhythm. </p><p align="left">“<em>Oh my fucking god...</em>” Agatha gasped as her hand flew to land on Rio's head and pushed her closer.</p><p align="left">At that, Rio slid a third finger inside.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck, fuck, fuck—keep going, keep going—oh my fucking god...</em>” Agatha moaned, each word was breaking apart with pleasure.</p><p align="left">Rio could feel how close Agatha was, so she maintained the same relentless pace—thrusting, sucking, consuming her completely.</p><p align="left">Agatha's orgasm crashed over her only a few seconds later, her walls clenched around Rio's fingers as her muscular thighs trapped Rio's head. But even with the limited space, Rio kept going.</p><p align="left">Agatha's body trembled, her hips were jerking up as she tried to pull Rio away from between her legs.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuckfuckfuck!</em>”</p><p align="left">But Rio didn't stop—not until she had wrung out every last aftershock of pleasure from her.</p><p align="left">Finally, Agatha's muscles loosened. Rio sat straight again and pulled out her fingers gently and sucked them clean.</p><p align="left">“Come here, <em>you</em>,” Agatha murmured, still trying to steady her heavy breaths.</p><p align="left">Rio grinned and moved up. Her hands rested on the sides of Agatha's body. She studied her for a second, then crashed their lips together in a deep, lingering kiss, their mouths sharing the sweet, addictive taste of Agatha's arousal.</p><p align="left">Both of their bodies regained their calmness. Agatha sat straight, her back rested against the headboard, while Rio sat on her heels in front of her.</p><p align="left">“Take those off,” Agatha said, eyeing Rio's sweatpants.</p><p align="left">Rio quickly removed both, her sweatpants and underwear.</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled her closer, their eyes locked for a moment before their lips met in yet another heated, lustful kiss.</p><p align="left">They pulled back slightly, and Agatha's gaze dropped, trailing down from Rio's breasts to her abs before returning to her darkened eyes. </p><p align="left">“Come on. Sit.” Agatha tapped her thigh.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her for a moment before straddling Agatha's leg. The moment her dripping cunt made contact with the flesh of Agatha's thigh, Rio's throat produced a sound foreign even to her—a mix between a moan, a cry, and a gasp.</p><p align="left">She began moving her hips, but Agatha was quick to stop her.</p><p align="left">“Let me look at you.”</p><p align="left">Rio whined in protest, but Agatha's grip on her hips was firm. She glanced down at Agatha—who was staring at her with awe.</p><p align="left">“God, you're perfect.”</p><p align="left">One of Agatha's hands cupped Rio's breast, making Rio even more impatient. But she didn't move, she couldn't interrupt the look of pure reverence on Agatha's face.</p><p align="left">“Move for me, baby.”</p><p align="left">
<em>Baby...</em>
</p><p align="left">Rio started rocking her hips against Agatha's thigh. The sight she had witnessed minutes ago had already pushed her close to the edge, and her orgasm was building at an intense, searing speed. </p><p align="left">Agatha's fingers teased and pulled at her nipple, sending even more pleasure through her. Her hips moved faster, chasing that orgasm.</p><p align="left">“<em>I'm close. Fuck</em>.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Mhmm</em>, cum for me baby.”</p><p align="left">Seconds later, her orgasm tore through her. Fooding her body with intense pleasure.</p><p align="left">Before Rio could recover, Agatha swiftly lifted her and sat her down on the bed. Agatha straightened her position against the headboard and motioned for Rio to sit between her legs, parting them widely to make space.</p><p align="left">Rio's back rested against Agatha's front, her legs were spreading widely on either side.</p><p align="left">She felt Agatha's fingers gliding up and down her dripping cunt, teasing her as soft kisses landed on her shoulder.</p><p align="left">The moment Agatha's finger made contact with her throbbing clit, Rio's legs twitched and a low moan escaped her throat involuntarily. She was still sensitive from her previous orgasm.</p><p align="left">Agatha's lips moved higher, sucking gently on that sweet, sensitive spot just below her ear. Another moan slipped from Rio's mouth. Louder and more lustful.</p><p align="left">“That's the most beautiful sound I've ever heard,” Agatha murmured against Rio'd ear. Her warm breath made Rio shiver forcing her to shut her eyes closed.</p><p align="left">Agatha's right thumb circled her clit while her left hand slid down, fingers dipping inside her. The moment Agatha pushed two fingers into her, Rio let out a deep, rich moan.</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh fuck, Agatha.</em>”</p><p align="left">Agatha started with a slow, teasing rhythm—but within seconds, she was thrusting into her tight, dripping cunt with relentless speed.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fucking christ. Fuck I'm gonna—</em>”</p><p align="left">“Hold it for me, angel,” Agatha whispered, pressing another kiss to Rio's shoulder.</p><p align="left">“<em>I can't. God, I can't.</em>” Rio's breaths were ragged.</p><p align="left">“<em>Yeah</em>?” Agatha's pace quickened—something Rio hadn't even thought was possible. Her head dropped back, and a loud moan ripped from her throat.</p><p align="left">“<em>HolyfuckAgatha</em>!”</p><p align="left">“I want to hear you moan my name every fucking day, Rio.”</p><p align="left">Agatha's fingers curled just right, hitting that spot Rio knew all too well, applying more and more pressure. She felt her walls clench so tight, and before she could say anything, her body reacted on its own. Her hands grabbed Agatha's thighs for dear life as a forceful gush of her orgasm splashed out, soaking the mattress wet with her pleasure.</p><p align="left">Rio was practically screaming at that point, her orgasm was exploding through her—she had never felt this amount of pleasure all at once.</p><p align="left">“This is...” Agatha murmured after pressing a kiss to Rio's shoulder. “<em>So goddamn beautiful.</em>” Another kiss.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck, Agatha,</em>” Rio panted, her breaths were still shallow from her loud moans.</p><p align="left">Once her body recovered, her grip on Agatha's thighs loosened. She had held on so tightly that the pale skin was flushed red. She turned to face Agatha, Rio rested her head against her chest, securing herself in  tight embrace.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and pressed a kiss to the top of her head.</p><p align="left">“You're staying,” Rio whispered as her hold tightened. It was somewhere between a question and a statement.</p><p align="left">“I am.”</p><p align="left">They held each other in silence for some time, wrapped in warmth. Their bodies were pressing together as the scent of sex and sweat lingered in the atmosphere.</p><p align="left">Rio felt it—the way Agatha was taking deep breaths, one after another, as if preparing herself to speak, only to stop herself for minutes at a time.</p><p align="left">“I...I went to Paris because it was...” Agatha hesitated. “It's been ten years since I lost my son, Nicholas.” She took another deep inhale before continuing, “Every year, I hold a memorial for him in the house we once lived in. Just me and... the memory of him.”</p><p align="left">Rio felt Agatha's hold tightening around her arm. She felt the way her chest rose and fell heavily and heard the pain-laced tone of her voice.</p><p align="left">“I decided this year that I should move on from that past—to leave that house and those memories behind, and just come back here.” Agatha sighed. “But I... I couldn't. I couldn't leave everything behind. I couldn't just pretend that I moved on, that I was okay with all of this. So, I booked my flight and went there.”</p><p align="left">Agatha lifted Rio's face so their eyes could meet.</p><p align="left">“It wasn't that I wanted to ignore you... God, Rio, you don't know how much you mean to me. But I just couldn't, I'm sor—”</p><p align="left">“Don't apologize. Don't even think of saying that word,” Rio interrupted as she cupped Agatha's face. “I'm the one who's sorry. I shouldn't have made this all about me. I'm sorry about your son, Agatha... I'm truly sorry.” At that, Rio's eyes welled up against her will, tears slipping down her cheeks, landing on Agatha's bare skin.</p><p align="left">“I don't know what to say. Hell, I don't even know what to do. But what I do know is that I want to make you feel okay. I want you to be sure that I'll be right next to you whenever you want or need me. I'll make sure I'm worthy of your trust, to let you know that you can always come back to me. And whatever you're feeling, I will be there.” Rio's gaze never wavered from Agatha's as she spoke.</p><p align="left">“Seeing your exhausted, beautiful face, seeing how tired you were... I just wanted to—<em>God</em>, I'm sorry, Agatha. Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.”</p><p align="left">Rio wasn't even sure she was speaking coherently—her words trumbled from her lips, raw and unfiltered. But they still felt like they weren't enough. She would have this conversation again when she was sober, when she could properly express what she felt and what she truly wanted to say.</p><p align="left">“Just let me hold you for now. I don't want anything else.” Agatha whispered as she stroked Rio's back gently. She kissed her forehead, then held her close to her chest again, embracing her as tight as possible.</p><p align="left">They lay there, wrapped in each other's arms, their bodies molding into one. Their fingers traced feather-light touches over bare skin, memorizing, soothing. Rio listened to the steadying rhythm of Agatha's heartbeat, the storm within her was finally settling into peace.</p><p align="left">It wasn't long before Agatha's breath evened out and she drifted to sleep. </p><p align="left">Rio lifted her head slightly to look at her—at how peaceful, soft and heartbreakingly beautiful she looked like this. She pressed a tender kiss to Agatha's cheek, before laying her head back down against her chest, letting the warmth of Agatha's body and the steady beat of her heart lull her into sleep.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="left">The first thing Rio felt as she regained consciousness in the morning was soft fingertips trailing on her bare back. Touches that were so calculated and delicate. So warm and precise, touching her skin softly and tenderly. Fingertips tracing the brown moles on her tanned skin, as if committing their placement to memory. Tender fingertips moving carefully from spot to a spot, as if their owner was afraid of disturbing her and waking her up—as if those fingertips feared pressing a little too hard, shattering the stars that were scattered across her body in a way.</p><p align="left">Rio felt it—the warmth of the touch drifting, fingers were moving softly from the top of her spine down to her pelvic bone, stopping just above the duvet that was covering her lower body. Then, the fingers would travel up again, following the same path, leaving behind the same warmth and lingering effect.</p><p align="left">The touches were featherlight. So caring in their trailing. So soft and gentle, forcing Rio's eyes to remain closed so she could feel them fully on her skin, staying in the present moment for as long as possible. It felt a little selfish, to consume all the safety these touches provided. But she won't apologize for it.</p><p align="left">Her cheek was pressed against the pillow and her arms were tucked beneath it. After a heartbeat, Rio moved her head closer to where that heavenly, soothing scent lingered. The moment her face rested against the soft skin, the scent filled her nose, rushed to her brain, and made her slightly open her eyes. The first thing she saw was Agatha's navel. Rio smiled. </p><p align="left">The luminous skin that was glowing warmed her more than the sunbeams sneaking through the slightly parted curtains.</p><p align="left">She lifted her head up slightly and Rio looked up at Agatha through her eyelashes. Agatha seemed focused, her gaze trailing over every inch of Rio's bare back—every freckle, every fading scar, every neglected spot that had gone unnoticed for years.</p><p align="left">Rio just watched her and felt her touches, the smile on her lips not fading, it was only growing wider.</p><p align="left">Waking up to such a sight filled her with pure happiness. Looking at Agatha first thing in the morning warmed her heart, made it pound in her chest, beating an upbeat melody with every thrum.</p><p align="left">“Good morning,” Rio said, her voice was still thick with sleep.</p><p align="left">The moment those two words left her lips, Agatha's movements stilled on her skin, as if she had been caught doing something wrong, something forbidden, something she shouldn't be doing.</p><p align="left">Rio waited for Agatha to look back at her, and when she finally did, Rio moved her hand from her side and placed it over Agatha's, resting just above her back, as if encouraging her to continue the quiet masterpiece she had been painting with her fingertips. But Agatha didn't.</p><p align="left">A second or two passed before Agatha finally spoke, her beautiful smile gracing her lips.</p><p align="left">“Good morning.”</p><p align="left">She sat beside Rio's laying body, her wild dark hair was cascading over both shoulders, trailing down to her chest. Those ocean-like blue eyes gazed down at Rio. That beautiful, delicious mouth curved upward into a smile. That sharp, perfect nose—one that Rio found herself growing addicted to looking at—was slightly crinkled.</p><p align="left">Rio grinned and simply stared at Agatha for a moment.</p><p align="left">“What time is it? Why are you up already?” Rio asked, warmth and softness lacing her voice.</p><p align="left">“Ten in the morning,” Agatha answered, still looking at her.</p><p align="left">The gaze they held was steady, stretching time between them, until Rio finally blinked, disrupting the connection.</p><p align="left">“Shit.”</p><p align="left">Rio buried her face in Agatha's abdomen, her smile was still visible, imprinted on her lips.</p><p align="left">“Why? What's wrong?” Agatha asked as her other hand moved to land gently on Rio's hair, stroking it.</p><p align="left">“I have a lecture in half an hour,”</p><p align="left">Rio mumbled, her face was still pressed against that soft skin. “I could cancel it, though.” She lifted her head, her gaze returning to Agatha. To that ethereal being sitting by her side, on her bed.</p><p align="left">“You shouldn't.”</p><p align="left">“No, it's okay. I was already planning on canceling it anyway.”</p><p align="left">Silence wrapped around them for a few moments as their eyes remained locked.</p><p align="left">Something flickered in Agatha's gaze, something undefined, something so out of reach and beyond explanation.</p><p align="left">“Rio...” Agatha whispered her name, as if the two syllables had slipped past her lips without permission.</p><p align="left">“Hmm?” Rio hummed, her soft, brown eyes were still locked onto the blue ones—sailing in them.</p><p align="left">Agatha's fingers resumed their soft touches on Rio's skin, but something had shifted. The touches now felt anxious, unsure. Her fingertips transferring their uncertainty to Rio's body. As if Agatha wasn't sure of something—something Rio was desperate to uncover. Eager to lift the weight of it onto her own shoulders. </p><p align="left">Agatha's gaze abandoned Rio's and settled on her own hand, traveling across Rio's back, which only made Rio even more curious about the reason behind the hesitation radiating from Agatha's whole being.</p><p align="left">After a heartbeat or so, “Nothing.” Agatha said with a smile, still observing the journey of her hand.</p><p align="left">Rio felt a flicker of disappointment. She had expected something else to come out, something <em>more</em>.</p><p align="left">Her mind drifted to last night, replaying the sounds and images in her head. Agatha had shared something personal with her, and how Rio had reacted?</p><p align="left">Her mind spiraled, dissecting every word, every action, scolding herself in the depths of her thoughts.</p><p align="left">Did her reaction lack empathy? Were her words not enough? Had she made it about herself again? Had she said too much without an honest meaning behind?</p><p align="left">One thing was certain—her reaction hadn't been enough. Her words hadn't been enough. And now, it felt too late to fix it, too late to say what she really wanted to say, to actually lift the weight of the burden instead of just saying she would.</p><p align="left">The thoughts and voices inside her gnawed at her, bite after bite.</p><p align="left">Maybe Agatha was thinking the same. Maybe her hesitation came from knowing and expecting how Rio would react once she spoke her mind. </p><p align="left">Rio's heart pounded in her chest, loud, rapid and uneasy. The soothing touches on her back did nothing to calm her. Tears began forming in her eyes. She wanted to avoid the embarrassment of being too weak, of having her own mind turn against her. </p><p align="left">She drifted her gaze from Agatha's face and buried her face in the pillow.</p><p align="left">Rio felt those fingertips leaving flames in their wake. The warmth they had once provided a few moments ago were turning into something scalding.</p><p align="left">She managed to hold back her tears, maybe one or two escaped, spilling into the pillow—but she managed holding the rest. Holding them captive.</p><p align="left">After forcing a smile onto her face, she lifted her head again. And the sight before her was unreal. Looking at Agatha like this felt like witnessing something divine. Forbidden. Out of this world. Something out of her league. Something she didn't deserve.</p><p align="left">“Can you turn around?” Agatha asked. Her voice was low, ringing in Rio's ears and sending waves of electricity through her entire body—only to settle into a slow-burning blaze in her stomach, making it twist.</p><p align="left">Rio smirked despite the heat rising within her as she looked at Agatha and turned around to lay on her back.</p><p align="left">She heard it—the way Agatha's breath hitched, trapping itself in her chest.</p><p align="left">The moment Rio looked at Agatha, something struck her heart.</p><p align="left">The way Agatha was looking at her exposed skin... no one had ever looked at her like that before. And that realization ignited a fire within her, wild and untamed.</p><p align="left">Her chest heaved as Agatha continued to look at her with that gaze. And it was obvious—obvious to them both—the way Rio's chest heavily rose and fell, the way the air between them thickened.</p><p align="left">Despite Agatha's lingering stare at her breasts, despite the way she swallowed so hard Rio could hear it, despite the heat radiating off her, sending shivers coursing through her body—Agatha didn't touch Rio. She didn't run her slender fingers across the exposed skin before her eyes. </p><p align="left">She just <em>looked</em>.</p><p align="left">“Can you—will you remove this, please?” Agatha asked, pointing a finger toward the earthy green duvet covering Rio's lower body—though her eyes remained fixed on Rio's upper half.</p><p align="left">Rio smirked as she kicked the duvet off with her feey, letting it fall to the floor.</p><p align="left">She propped herself up on her elbows and turned her head to the side, Agatha was still looking at her. Wetting her dry lips over and over again.</p><p align="left">Rio nearly moaned.</p><p align="left">Because that look in Agatha's eyes?</p><p align="left">It was too hot. Undeniable.</p><p align="left">Something that couldn't be ignored. Something that made her stomach clench.</p><p align="left">And Agatha was only... <em>looking</em></p><p align="left">Drifting her eyes up and down. Taking Rio's face in, observing her body, all the way down to her toes—repeatedly. Letting her gaze linger in certain places, wetting her lips when her eyes landed on particular curves. And it was too much. Too much to handle, because Rio could feel herself getting more turned on with every passing second, just from a look. A look that wasn't normal, from a goddess of a woman.</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed down her moans, feeling them echo inside her. She licked her lips more than once, but to no avail, she needed Agatha's lips to water hers. </p><p align="left">The next second, Rio felt Agatha getting out of the bed and stood at the footboard of it in all the glory of her naked body. It made it impossible for Rio to focus on anything, even more impossible when Agatha locked eyes with her. Rio felt her heart drop into her stomach. It was all too much.</p><p align="left">Agatha wasn't speaking, only the combined heavy breaths of them both filling the silence. Blending with the intensity of the atmosphere.</p><p align="left">Agatha was <em>looking</em>, as if studying something, memorizing the position, feeling it.</p><p align="left">“Lift your leg up.”</p><p align="left">The words nearly sent Rio over the edge. It wasn't a question. It was much like... an order. A command.</p><p align="left">The tone of Agatha's voice and the look in her eyes were making everything much harder. And the fact that Rio was so painfully aware of how wet she already was made her hesitate. It would be embarrassing—because Agatha had literally done nothing. She had only looked at her...</p><p align="left">But Rio bent her knee up anyway, ignoring the embarrassment curling in her stomach.</p><p align="left">She didn't miss the way Agatha's eyes widened or the way she licked her lips the moment Rio moved.</p><p align="left">Agatha's gaze met Rio's for only a brief second before it dropped again, taking in the position Rio was in—laying before her, as if offering herself.</p><p align="left">Yet Rio didn't feel exposed. She didn't feel embarrassed. She felt overwhelmed. The silence of Agatha was overwhelming. The way she was looking at her was consuming. Making her feel vulnerable.</p><p align="left">Agatha stood there, in silence, examining Rio's body—every part her eyes could reach, every spot, every bit of skin and hair.</p><p align="left">Rio felt herself dripping, and she clenched her eyes shut. The idea of being almost fully open like <em>that</em>. Being looked at like <em>that</em>. Being studied like <em>that</em>—it excited her in a way she had never experienced before. And she was so goddamn aware that the reason wasn't the act, wasn't the position, wasn't the fact that she was laying on her bed, helpless, as those blue eyes devoured her. The reason was who those blue eyes belonged to. Who was standing at the edge of her bed, looking at her like she was a goddamn goddess. </p><p align="left">
<em>Agatha Harkness.</em>
</p><p align="left">“Holy fuck, <em>Rio</em>...”</p><p align="left">Rio opened her eyes. The way Agatha said her name made her body twitch.</p><p align="left">“You're perfect.”</p><p align="left">After looking at her for a few more seconds, Agatha climbed onto the bed as Rio sat back against the headboard. Agatha leaned in, crashing their lips together. Her hand wrapped around Rio's neck, pulling her closer—deepening the kiss as much as possible. Their lips parted only for a second, just long enough to breathe, before finding each other again, the heat between them growing intense.</p><p align="left">Foreheads were pressing together, breaths were mingling, Rio's hand was resting on Agatha's forearm as she looked into her eyes.</p><p align="left">“Can you... <em>Fuck</em>... Can you touch me?” Rio panted.</p><p align="left">Agatha's pupils dilated. She leaned in and kissed Rio again as her hand drifted lower. The moment her fingers found the warm silk, they both moaned into each other's mouths.</p><p align="left">“Oh my fucking god, Rio. You are... You're <em>soaked</em>.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? <em>Please</em>, just fuck me.”</p><p align="left">Agatha moaned at that.</p><p align="left">They tangled in bed once again. Bodies were pressing against each other as heat consumed them both. The safety of Agatha's embrace was terrifying. How normal it felt was <em>abnormal</em>.</p><p align="left">Rio tried to push the thoughts away, tried to live in the moment instead. In the present. Which was being held in Agatha's arms. Being able to fill her senses with her intoxicating scent. Feeling her completely. Because a voice in the back of her head kept whispering that this warmth won't last, so she held Agatha's middle tighter, pulling her as close as possible.</p><p align="left">“We should shower,” Rio murmured against Agatha's skin, and Agatha hummed in response. </p><p align="left">Should she add the word <em>together</em>? Or would that make her sound too needy? God, if only she knew what Agatha was thinking.</p><p align="left">“Together, you mean?”</p><p align="left">Rio's heart stopped for a beat.</p><p align="left">“Yes.”</p><p align="left">Agatha pressed a kiss to her temple.</p><p align="left">“But I really need to go afterward.” Another kiss. “I'll come back another time. I promise.”</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her head slightly to look at Agatha's face. Sincerity was written all over it, reassuring in every way.</p><p align="left">“Okay.”</p><p align="left">They stayed in bed a few minutes longer, wrapped in the warmth of embracing one another. Pressing the kisses on their skins. Filling each other's ears with whispered words.</p><p align="left">Then, hand in hand, they stepped into the shower.</p><p align="left">Rio turned the water on and as it began cascading down, soaking her body, she felt Agatha's arms wrap around her waist, pressing their bodies together. Agatha's lips met her shoulder, again and again, before trailing soft kisses all the way down her spine. Nothing was rushed, every kiss was slow, deliberate, calming.</p><p align="left">Agatha's hands held Rio's hips securely, her thumbs were stroking the soft skin gently as the warm water streamed over them both.</p><p align="left">“How did you get that?” Agatha's voice was soft as her thumb brushed over a fading scar on Rio's lower back.</p><p align="left">Rio closed her eyes for a moment, leaning back against Agatha, pressing her back into front. Agatha tightened her hold, pulling Rio to her front even closer.</p><p align="left">“A stab from the back. Quite literally.” Rio chuckled awkwardly. “Four years ago, my ex—she wasn't my girlfriend at the time... She was being attacked by some guy at a bar. So I—I stepped in, pushed him away and he fell to the ground. I was facing her just checking if she was okay, and... the next thing I knew, I felt a goddamn knife go into my body.” Rio chuckled again, but Agatha's grip around her middle only tightened. “And...” Rio let out a breathy laugh before continuing. “It was the same fucking guy she'd been cheating on me with for months. I didn't even recognize him at first, the thought only hit me two months ago.” Rio laughed. Saying it out loud felt absurd. Hearing her own voice make sense of how fucked up the whole thing was—<em>God</em>, she must look so goddamn dumb right now.</p><p align="left">The moment her laughter faded, after laughing like a hysterical fool, Agatha turned her around by the hips and locked eyes with her.</p><p align="left">Rio's smile disappeared.</p><p align="left">Agatha cupped her face with both hands and leaned in, whispering, “<em>I'm sorry</em>.”</p><p align="left">Then she kissed her lips—softly. Deeply. Pouring into the kiss what words couldn't say. And Rio felt it, she felt everything Agatha's lips and tongue were trying to tell her.</p><p align="left">Rio's eyes burned so she shut them tightly—but hot, stinging tears spilled down her cheeks, landing on Agatha's hands. Agatha's thumbs moved up, gently wiping the tears away as she continued kissing Rio—tender, slow, reassuring.</p><p align="left">When their lips parted, their faces remained close. Only a warm breath apart.</p><p align="left">Rio opened her eyes and looked into Agatha's. She smiled, despite the tears Agatha's thumbs kept brushing away.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked... <em>breathtaking</em>.</p><p align="left">Her dark hair was wet, clinging to both sides of her face. Water droplets were resting on her lashes. Others were sliding down the tip of her nose and her chin. Her wet lips looked more delicious, more kissable than ever.</p><p align="left">Rio couldn't resist the heavenly sight, so she leaned in and pressed her lips against Agatha's. Her hands traveled to Agatha's hips, smoothing the skin up and down. When Rio pulled back again, her lips were culed up in an honest smile.</p><p align="left">“I really want to wash this goddamn, beautiful hair of yours.” She bit her bottom lip, looking straight into Agatha's blue eyes.</p><p align="left">“Then do it,” Agatha murmured with a smirk. Her thumbs were still stroking Rio's wet cheeks—soaked from both water and tears.</p><p align="left">Rio grabbed the rosemary-scented shampoo bottle. She placed a hand on Agatha's hip and squeezed it gently to signal her to turn around. When Agatha did, Rio poured it into her hands and smoothed it on Agatha's hair—lathering it slowly, carefully.</p><p align="left">Agatha let out a soft moan. It was barely audible, but Rio froze mid-motion. Her breath hitched. The sound was so faint, yet, so intoxicating and it sent a shiver to run down her spine.</p><p align="left">A second passed, then another. Rio forced herself to keep moving, her fingers were gently massaging Agatha's scalp, though her heart pounded with a calm, steady intensity. Because the intimacy was wrapping around them wasn't just heat—it was something more, so much more. Something about how... <em>natural</em> it felt to do such an act. And that, more than anything else, made Rio's heart tighten in her chest.</p><p align="left">After completing the task at hand, Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha's waist and rested the side of her face against Agatha's back. Something inside her urged her to not let go just yet, to stay as close to Agatha as possible. To soak in every second with her. Rio craved the warmth of her body pressed against Agatha's. And it was terrifying, because she still didn't know what was coming. Agatha had been gone for a week, and Rio had felt weak, mentally and physically.</p><p align="left">Then what? Every time she thought about it, It made no sense. She still didn't know who Agatha really was. The only thing she did know was that she wanted her near—and more than anything, she wanted to know and understand her.</p><p align="left">They dried off and stepped out of the shower, after a few more minutes of embracing each other's wet figures, exchanging slow, sloppy kisses.</p><p align="left">Rio sat on the bed, wrapped in a robe while watching Agatha slip into her clothes.</p><p align="left">“Are you sure you don't want some breakfast? Coffee at least?”</p><p align="left">Agatha zipped her trousers and looked at Rio with a soft, small smile. She flickered her hair back and walked toward Rio, leaning down to press a brief kiss to her lips.</p><p align="left">“Another time.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, but can I at least...” Rio hesitated.</p><p align="left">“What?” Agatha asked, tucking a strand of hair behind Rio's ear.</p><p align="left">“No, nothing.”</p><p align="left">“Come on, say it.” Agatha whispered, her warm breath brushed over Rio's lips and made them part instinctively.</p><p align="left">“I don't know... Maybe... Can I drive you to where you need to go? I mean, I know you didn't come in your car yesterday and I really have nothing better to do, so...”</p><p align="left">“Okay.” Agatha leaned in and kissed her again.</p><p align="left">Rio threw on a sweater and jeans which Agatha described as <em>charming</em> and then they both headed downstairs, stepping outside into the crisp air before sliding into Rio's car.</p><hr/><p align="left">They were talking, five minutes away from their destination when Agatha suddenly patted her pockets and hissed, “Shit.”</p><p align="left">“What's wrong?” Rio glanced at her.</p><p align="left">“I think I forgot my phone.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, I'll go back.”</p><p align="left">“Yes, please.”</p><p align="left">Rio turned the car around and drove back to her place. She got out and Agatha was following right behind her. As Rio approached the door, she reached to open it only to find it already open.</p><p align="left">Her brows knitted in confusion. She was sure she had locked the door before going—twenty minutes ago. </p><p align="left">Her eyes flickered to Agatha before she pushed the door open.</p><p align="left">And what she saw was a fucking haunting nightmare.</p><p align="left">“You've got to be kidding me!”</p><p align="left">“Hey, Rio.”</p><p align="left">Rio's jaw clenched.</p><p align="left">“How the fuck did you get in here?”</p><p align="left">“Well, I know where you keep the spare key.” Jane stood up from the chair and started walking toward Rio.</p><p align="left">“Get the fuck out, Jane.”</p><p align="left">“Why don't you answer any of my calls? I feel like a dog barking just to get your attention, Rio.”</p><p align="left">“I said, get the fuck out.” Rio's voice came through clenched teeth.</p><p align="left">She tried not to lose her temper. Tried not to yell. Tried not to snap. But who was she kidding? Seeing that bitch standing in front of her made her sick, about to vomit her guts out. That woman had some serious fucked-up problems, and she loved dragging Rio into the mud with her. </p><p align="left">“I just wanted to talk to you. Also, I did live in this house for three years, so relax. Don't make a big deal out of it.”</p><p align="left">“And I fucking regret the moment you ever stepped a foot into this house.”</p><p align="left">Jane laughed. That fucking <em>annoying</em> laugh of hers.</p><p align="left">So Rio grabbed her wrist forcefully.</p><p align="left">“This is the last time I'll say this. Get the fuck out.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Oof</em>. Bold.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, you heard her. Get out.” </p><p align="left">The words came from behind Rio. She turned her head slightly, glancing at Agatha—because that was the first thing she had said in minutes.</p><p align="left">Rio's grip loosened at the distraction, so Jane yanked her wrist free.</p><p align="left">Then Jane's gaze flicked to Agatha.</p><p align="left">“And... who are you?” She asked, pointing a finger at Agatha.</p><p align="left">Agatha was calm, her hands buried in her pants pockets, looking straight at Rio's ex-girlfriend's face with that smirk on her face.</p><p align="left">“Lower that finger down, unless you want it broken.” Agatha's voice was smooth, steady.</p><p align="left">She took a small step closer to Rio, removing one hand from her pocket and resting it on Rio's back—a silent reassurance.</p><p align="left">Jane cackled. But she did lower her finger.</p><p align="left">“Good for you, Rio. You got yourself a bodyguard.”</p><p align="left">“Exactly.” Agatha's smirk deepened. “Now get lost.”</p><p align="left">Jane looked at them both, then walked past Agatha—bumping her shoulder on the way out. As she reached the door and opened it, she spoke again, “I'll see you,” and left, leaving the door open behind her.</p><p align="left">Rio stood in her place, annoyed and frustrated. The warmth of Agatha's hand resting on her back helped her steady her breaths.</p><p align="left">After a minute, without looking at Agatha, she walked toward the chair, feeling embarrassment creeping in.</p><p align="left">That? That was humiliating. Her toxic, creepy ex breaking into her house like that. Not being able to handle it herself. And letting Agatha to deal with it instead. It was all too much to process. She had come back to her house to do one thing and now she was dealing with something else entirely.</p><p align="left">Rio remained silent for a few, agonizing couple of minutes, and so did Agatha, who stood close by.</p><p align="left">“I could have dealt with her on my own, you know?” Rio finally said, still not looking at Agatha—only staring at the nearest object, which was beginning to blur. </p><p align="left">“I know,” Agatha replied, her voice was soft and knowing. “Sorry if I crossed a line.”</p><p align="left">“What line?” Rio finally looked up, but Agatha's features blurred together. She couldn't recognize them, not after seconds. “No, no. I'm sorry you had to see <em>that</em>.” Rio ran a furious hand through her hair, her irritation growing inside her.</p><p align="left">The way Jane had spoken to her in front of Agatha... What must Agatha think of her now? Someone who couldn't even handle their own ex? Great!</p><p align="left">“Rio...”</p><p align="left">“No, Agatha. Please... Can we not talk about this? Just—just forget it,” Rio said as she got up. Her voice sounded so small. So broken. “Let's find your phone, yeah?”</p><p align="left">Agatha only nodded, saying nothing more.</p><p align="left">She grabbed her phone from the table in the living room, checked it, then tossed it into her pocket.</p><p align="left">“I should get going now. You should rest, Rio.”</p><p align="left">“But—”</p><p align="left">“Don't,” Agatha said softly, extending her hand to touch Rio's face, but stopping short. Mid-air.</p><p align="left">Rio frowned at that. Instead of questioning it, she reached for Agatha's hand and held it.</p><p align="left">“I'll call you later,” Agatha added as she squeezed Rio's hand. Their eyes locked and Rio was painfully aware of the goddamn tears hanging on the edges, threatening to fall. </p><p align="left">She only looked at Agatha.</p><p align="left">Yes, she wanted to kiss her. Yes, she wanted to hug her. Yes, she wanted to talk to her. Yes, she wanted Agatha to tell her everything was going to be fine. Yes, she wanted to cry in Agatha's arms. Yes, she wanted to let everything out.</p><p align="left">But she didn't.</p><p align="left">She just stood there, looking into those blue eyes, not uttering a goddamn word.</p><p align="left">After a really long minute. Agatha leaned in and pressed a kiss to her cheek.</p><p align="left">“I'll call you,” She whispered. Then, this time, she did touch Rio's face—cupping it with one hand.“Take care.” </p><p align="left">And then, she left.</p><p align="left">The touch lingered on Rio's skin, just like everything else. Agatha's scent still filled her senses. She could still feel her presence somehow.</p><p align="left">But it wasn't the only one. She could feel her ex's presence too, the second Rio looked at the chair in the dining room. Jane's voice rang in her head, sharp and irritating. Triggering a dull ache behind her eyes.</p><p align="left">With a heavy sigh, Rio threw herself onto the couch. Collapsing on it.</p><p align="left">Here she was again. The same situation she had found herself in dozens of times. Helpless.</p><p align="left">She needed to do something about it. Because she was done. Done being dragged into her ex's sick games.</p><p align="left">And the first thing?</p><p align="left">She should change the goddamn lock. So that creepy bitch wouldn't be creeping around anymore.</p>

<p align="left">Perhaps Rio wasn't who she thought she was. The thoughts she had about herself—about how she acted—perhaps were only that: thoughts. Ideas that lived inside her head but never materialized into action. They were just... <em>thoughts</em>. In her head. Things she believed she was acting upon.</p><p align="left">One might proclaim certain ideas, thoughts and principles, but actually following them? That was a whole different story. Because proclaiming them was one thing, but living them, making the effort to embody them every day? That was something else entirely.</p><p align="left">Or at least, that was what Rio was thinking as she stared at her phone, the screen flashing with Agatha's name for the second time in ten minutes.</p><p align="left">She didn't pick up. She couldn't.</p><p align="left">She couldn't find it in herself to respond, to prepare herself to talk to Agatha, to hear the woman's voice after what happened this morning. Not even the alcohol in her system helped or encouraged her to pick up.</p><p align="left">It perhaps seemed silly. Answering a call was one of the easiest and simplest things in today's world. But was it? Not when considering who was on the other end of the line. Not when it was Agatha's voice she would be hearing. Not when there were a dozen of other things tangled together in her mind. </p><p align="left">No. Answering a call wasn't simple. It wasn't easy. In fact, it was one of the most overwhelming things ever.</p><p align="left">She watched as the screen dimmed and Agatha's name disappeared. At that moment, there were no options left. Even if she wanted to answer or decline, she couldn't. She had her chance—twice—and she missed them both.</p><p align="left">She could have made a choice, but she didn't. She just sat there, staring, instead of doing anything. She didn't know what she wanted, and she hadn't made anything clear to the other party.</p><p align="left">She was lost, confused, and in her confusion, she was dragging everyone else into the chaotic chaos her life had become.</p><p align="left">Part of her turmoil came from her uncertainty about everything. Especially about Agatha.</p><p align="left">She knew almost nothing about the woman—just a few threads, not enough to weave into anything. They were just... threads. And though Rio had tried to tie their ends together, hoping to grasp onto something, she hadn't caught anything.</p><p align="left">And she blamed herself for that. Because it wasn't as if she had asked for more. She had just sat there, willing to take whatever Agatha was ready to offer, which, as it turned out, wasn't much.</p><p align="left">She had so many questions, but they remained locked up in her head. She couldn't bring herself to set them free. Somehow, they made more sense that way. Or at least, that was what she convinced herself with.</p><p align="left">For nearly thirteen minutes, Rio sat on that couch, doing absolutely nothing—just overthinking her entire life.</p><p align="left">Her legs were spread apart, her back hunched forward, fingers were absently cracking as she stared at the phone laying on the table beside a half-empty bottle of vodka.</p><p align="left">She wished for something, some divine force to intervene, to unlock the situation she trapped herself in. She needed something, <em>anything</em>, to give her the key to break free.</p><p align="left">Then, after five more minutes—an eternity in Rio's mind—her phone vibrated again.</p><p align="left"><em>Agatha</em>.</p><p align="left">Rio grabbed the phone quickly and just... stared at it.</p><p align="left">Her hesitation was eating her alive, and it was ridiculous—especially considering that Agatha had been wrist-deep inside her only nine hours ago.</p><p align="left">“Fuck it,” Rio muttered to herself in drunkness. She cleared her throat and swiped to answer.</p><p align="left">As she did, she was met with silence. No breath, no sound from the other end. Just dead silence.</p><p align="left">So she forced herself to speak.</p><p align="left">“Hey.” Her voice came out almost a whisper, softer than what she intended.</p><p align="left">After fifteen seconds that Rio counted on her left hand's fingers, five after five, Agatha finally spoke.</p><p align="left">“Hey there. Are you alright, Rio?”</p><p align="left">Agatha's voice was laced with concern. Real concern, something Rio could both hear and feel.</p><p align="left">Rio's fingers stilled as she absentmindedly counted another five seconds. She stared ahead, not looking at anything in particular—more lost in thought than focused on what was in front of her.</p><p align="left">She wasn't fine. Not really. And she wanted Agatha to know. But why?</p><p align="left">Why did she want Agatha to know?</p><p align="left">Rio knew she was a bad liar—possibly the worst—but that never stopped her from lying every time someone asked whether she was okay or not. Yet, at that moment, even those bad lies refused to form. She couldn't bring herself to throw them at Agatha, whether she believed them or not. As if, with Agatha, she wanted to be nothing but honest. Transparent.</p><p align="left">“I don't know.”</p><p align="left">“That's okay. It's okay.” Agatha said, and Rio's heart clenched tightly in her chest. “What are you doing now?” Agatha asked.</p><p align="left">Rio's heart spiked—so hard it was terrifying to feel. She pressed a palm to her chest, rubbing it as her breaths turned unsteady. She leaned forward, grapped the bottle of alcohol with her hand, and chugged until the burn scorched her throat and stomach. Then, she set the nearly empty bottle on the floor beside her foot and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.</p><p align="left">“Rio? Are you there?”</p><p align="left">“I am.” Rio said as she leaned back into the couch. Her chest was heaving, her breaths uneven.</p><p align="left">“Why are you talking to me?” she asked as she closed her eyes.</p><p align="left">“What do you mean?” Agatha asked, her voice held uncertainty.</p><p align="left">“I mean... why are <em>you</em> talking to <em>me</em>?” Rio repeated. “You could be doing literally anything else with your time.” Rio chuckled. “Instead of trying to figure out what the fuck is wrong with me. Because, I can assure you, I don't even know what the fuck is wrong with me.”</p><p align="left">“Rio, are you... God, are you drunk?”</p><p align="left">“Am I drunk? <em>Am I</em>? Yes, Agatha. I am. <em>That</em>? I can answer gladly.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, look—”</p><p align="left">“You could like... have <em>whoever</em> you want. Seriously. Have you seen yourself? Absolutely fucking drop-dead gorgeous.” Rio interrupted.</p><p align="left">“Rio—”</p><p align="left">“You know when I knew I was out of your league? When I saw that redhead, Wanda...” Rio paused for a moment. “Whatever  the fuck her last name was.”</p><p align="left">“What? When did you see Wanda? How do you even know her?”</p><p align="left">Rio chuckled, stretching her arm to reach the bottle again without shifting her posture.</p><p align="left">“Believe it or not...” A sip. “She was at my birthday... The funny thing is—or it's not really funny, anyway, I never saw a painting of her while I was looking at your artwork. I was totally convinced that your type was dark–haired losers until I saw her.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, Rio. Honey, slow down.”</p><p align="left">“Look, I'm just saying...” Rio tightened her grip on the neck of the bottle. “You shouldn't be wasting your time with me.”</p><p align="left">“Why and how did you come to this conclusion, Rio?” Agatha sighed. “Look, it's not what you think it is. You're getting it wrong—”</p><p align="left">“Am I?” </p><p align="left">Agatha heavily sighed again but she kept speaking, pushing past Rio's constant interruptions.</p><p align="left">“Yes, you are. You're reading it wrong. You're overthinking it. I'm interested in... Look, I'll have this conversation with you when you're sober. I want to hear what you're feeling and thinking while you're sober, Rio. Not like this. Not over a phone call I didn't even think you'd answer.”</p><p align="left">“Well, I can't do life sober.”</p><p align="left">“We'll see about that.”</p><p align="left">“What about that blonde? At the club. Who is she? I saw her, you know. She's a model.”</p><p align="left">“Yes, she is,” Agatha sighed, sounding helpless.“What about her?”</p><p align="left">“I don't know. Is she... with you now?”</p><p align="left">“No, she's not. Rio...”</p><p align="left">“Do you sleep with her?”</p><p align="left">“Rio—”</p><p align="left">“<em>Do you</em>?”</p><p align="left">“Please, baby... Rio, just listen to me.”</p><p align="left">“No, you answer me.”</p><p align="left">They both fell silent.</p><p align="left">For a few, long minutes silence stretched between them. And it kept stretching.</p><p align="left">“...Okay, I got my answer.” </p><p align="left">Rio pressed the phone harder against her ear, almost hurting skull, and before Agatha could respond, she hung up.</p><p align="left">The phone hit the couch as she threw it aside, stretching her arms out, though her grip on the now empty bottle remained tight.</p><p align="left">Where had that come from? All that jealousy. All that possessiveness?</p><p align="left">Rio wasn't the jealous type. Not at all. She hadn't even realized she was jealous of both women until now. Until she said it out loud—until the alcohol forced it to the surface.</p><p align="left">Those weren't the questions Rio wanted to ask. Not the information she wanted to know. And definitely not the side of Agatha she was interested in knowing first. But the damage was done.</p><p align="left">If she hadn't scared Agatha away before, she sure had now.</p><p align="left">Rio stood up, went upstairs and headed to her room. She paused in the doorway, staring at the dimly lit space. Then, she stepped inside and turned the light on. Her eyes swept over the room until they landed on the silver ring she found earlier—<em>Agatha's</em>.</p><p align="left">She had spotted it on the floor near the bed while cleaning up or... pretended to do so.</p><p align="left">She had stared at it for a solid ten minutes before placing it on the nightstand. It was the one Agatha wore on her thumb. The same one she had forgotten to take off—the one Rio had felt, cold against her skin when Agatha fucked her in on the kitchen island a week ago.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at it for a few seconds, then she walked toward the wardrobe to do what she came here to do.</p><p align="left">She stripped off her black tank top and replaced it with an oversized black button-up shirt, leaving only one or two buttons fastened in the middle. Next, she slid off her shorts and pulled on a pair of black jeans. The act was difficult in her drunken state, but she managed while stumbling.</p><p align="left">Her discarded clothes remained on the floor, the wardrobe door left open as she dragged herself to the full-length mirror.</p><p align="left">She studied her reflection, though nothing was really clear. She had been thinking about cutting her hair for a long time. A really long time.</p><p align="left">Tonight was the night.</p><p align="left">But it wasn't just about cutting her hair. There was something else. A hidden agenda buried somewhere.</p><p align="left">That hairdresser with her short hair, muscular body and cool band t-shirts. Someone who reminded Rio of her youth. The twenty-or thirty-something lesbian who had been flirting with Rio for nearly two years—whether they accidentally met on the street, the salon, the nearby bar, or even the supermarket. </p><p align="left">Rio wanted a haircut. And that woman worked there—if she still worked there.</p><p align="left">Was she a bad person for thinking this way?</p><p align="left">Hell. Who the fuck gives a fuck?</p><p align="left">She was drunk. Not a single clear thought floated through her mind. Nothing seemed right or wrong. Everything felt possible.</p><p align="left">She looked at herself for a few more seconds, then grapped a pack of cigarettes, slipped one between her lips before shoving the pack into her pocket and her wallet went into the other pocket.</p><p align="left">Downstairs, she lit the cigarette in the kitchen and put the lighter in her pocket as well. Pulled on her trainers and grapped the new door keys before stepping outside.</p><p align="left">Before the door fully closed behind her, she hesitated. Stepping back inside, she grapped her phone from the couch, then walked out again.</p><p align="left">She walked—more like dragged herself—to the salon. Her mind was a chaos. Nothing was clear. Her vision was blurred, and she stumbled into a few people along the way. But somehow, she made it. </p><p align="left">The ten-minute walk and the night air sobered her. Just a little.</p><p align="left">Once inside, the strak white lighting attacked her eyes, almost burning them.</p><p align="left">She had no appointment so she prepared to wait. But before she could even sit down, that woman approached her. </p><p align="left">Miriam, if Rio remembered correctly.</p><p align="left">“Nice seeing you here.” Miriam said with a smile, and Rio straightened up.</p><p align="left">“Need a haircut or did you come here to see me?”</p><p align="left">Rio managed a laugh that didn't sound too drunk. Or maybe it was obvious. “Maybe both?”</p><p align="left">“Oh, careful there. I might believe you.”</p><p align="left">“Then believe me.” Rio whispered, a smirk forming on her lips.</p><p align="left">Miriam raised an eyebrow. “Did you finally recieve my signals, then?” She motioned for Rio to take a seat. “Come here.”</p><p align="left">Once Rio sat, she looked at their reflection in the mirror. Focusing mostly on herself, not the woman standing behind her.</p><p align="left">“I recieved them a while ago.”</p><p align="left">Miriam chuckled at that. </p><p align="left">She picked up a comb and started running it through Rio's dark hair. Rio's eyes remained locked on the mirror, her vision growing blurrier with every passing second.</p><p align="left">“How do you want it?”</p><p align="left">“Just cut it short.”</p><p align="left">“How short are we thinking?”</p><p align="left">Rio weakly lifted her hand up and pointed at her shoulder. Not able to form something as simple as <em>shoulder-length</em>.</p><p align="left">“Okay.” Miriam slid her fingers through Rio's dark hair, stroking it gently before leaning in—her mouth was close to Rio's ear, “My shift ends in fifteen minutes, which means by the time I'm done with your hair—” </p><p align="left">Rio turned her head to look at the woman. “Great.”</p><p align="left">They locked eyes for a few seconds before Rio turned back to her reflection.</p><p align="left">“Okay, let's wash your hair then.”</p><p align="left">“Do it without the washing. Just cut it.”</p><p align="left">And Miriam did as she was told.</p><p align="left">She cut Rio's hair, and by the time she was done she asked if Rio liked it. Rio managed a feigned, toothy smile and mumbled a few words—<em>lies</em>. Because she wasn't really aware of what was happening around her. She didn't even know if her hair had been cut or if it was still the same. She'd probably like it or regret it in the morning.</p><p align="left">When Rio stood up from the chair, her legs almost gave out beneath her, but Miriam caught her by the forearm.</p><p align="left">“You okay?”</p><p align="left">“Totally. Just a little dizzy.”</p><p align="left">“Alright, I'll go grab my jacket.”</p><p align="left">While waiting, Rio paid at the counter, leaving a decent tip.</p><p align="left">Then Miriam returned. They stepped outside into the busy, noisy street, packed with people and layered with sounds that made Rio's headache worsen by the second.</p><p align="left">“My apartment's a few blocks away, or do you—”</p><p align="left">“No. Your place.”</p><p align="left">And they walked, silent. Not a single word was exchanged.</p><p align="left">“What made you change your mind?” The woman asked.</p><p align="left">“You were hitting on me while I had a girlfriend, Miriam.” Rio said.</p><p align="left">Saying the word girlfriend while referring to Jane made her sick.</p><p align="left">“Oh?” Miriam chuckled. “So you're single now?”</p><p align="left">“Where's your apartment? We've been walking for an hour.” </p><p align="left">“It's been five minutes.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? Feels like an hour to me.”</p><p align="left">“We're almost there.” She chuckled. </p><p align="left">Once they climbed the stairs and stood in front of Miriam's apartment, Rio stared at nothing while the woman unlocked the door.</p><p align="left">What was she doing? Why was she doing this? Who actually does this? Was she trying to forget something or someone? Agatha? Jane? Was fucking another woman really the only solution? Was she really <em>that</em> stupid?</p><p align="left">Miriam stepped inside and Rio followed close behind.</p><p align="left">“The place is kind of a mess.” Miriam said with a chuckle.</p><p align="left">And Rio remained silent. It wasn't like she could actually tell if a place was messy or not. Everything looked the same to her at that moment.</p><p align="left">“Do you want something to drink?”</p><p align="left">“No, just...”</p><p align="left">Rio took a few steps forward, closing the space between them. Then she kissed her.</p><p align="left">It was rough—<em>too</em> rough. She almost bit the woman's lip hard enough to make her bleed. <em>Almost</em>.</p><p align="left">Miriam tasted like whisky and tobacco. And she also tasted like—blood?</p><p align="left">Rio pulled back.</p><p align="left">“Fuck. I'm sorry.” Rio said.</p><p align="left">“You're the one who's bleeding.”</p><p align="left">Rio touched her lips with her fingers then looked at them. Two fingertips, smeared with her dark blood.</p><p align="left">She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and leaned in again, crashing her lips against Miriam's, not caring about the blood.</p><p align="left">“Let me take the lead, yeah? Where's the bedroom?” Rio asked, breathless. And Miriam only pointed with her hand, still catching her breath.</p><p align="left">They stepped inside.</p><p align="left">Rio shoved the woman onto the queen-sized bed and climbed on top of her.</p><p align="left">She stripped off Miriam's jacket. Then her t-shirt. Then her sport bra. </p><p align="left">But she didn't pause to admire her.</p><p align="left">Without kissing her way down or even worshipping the sight before her eyes properly—something Rio loved to do, to worship a woman's body—but she didn't. Not this time. She didn't take in the tattoos covering the woman's body. Didn't give her nipple piercing a second glance.</p><p align="left">She pulled Miriam's pants and boxers off in one swift motion.</p><p align="left">Then she fucked her. Three fingers and a mouth.</p><p align="left">Rio barely registered the sounds Miriam made, how she called her name, what she said—if she said anything at all.</p><p align="left">Nothing mattered except the rough pace she set. The steady rhythm of her fingers pumping in and out. Her tongue on the woman's clit.</p><p align="left">Rio only looked up when Miriam's body tensed, her orgasm tearing through her. But Rio didn't stop. </p><p align="left">Kept going. Kept thrusting and sucking. Until she gave her another orgasm.</p><p align="left">It wasn't until Rio sat back on her heels, wiping her fingers on her black shirt, that she realized she was still fully clothed.</p><p align="left">Miriam looked at Rio with a smile, sweat glistening on her forehead and her eyes were half-lidded.</p><p align="left">“Jesus christ, that was...” She chuckled. “Holy fuck, Rio.” Her smile was evident in her voice.</p><p align="left">For the first time, Rio really looked at the woman's features, and panic began clawing at her chest. Her heartbeat turned erratic and her breaths shortened.</p><p align="left">The woman lying beneath her propped herself up on her arms, still smiling.</p><p align="left">“Is it my turn now?”</p><p align="left">Rio <em>blinked</em>. Then blinked again. What was she doing here?</p><p align="left">But she took her shirt off anyway, exposing her chest—she hadn't worn a bra. She barely put the goddamn shirt on her body.</p><p align="left">Then she climbed onto the bed. As Miriam sat up, Rio leaned in and whispered in her ear, “<em>Make it quick.</em>” Then she stripped off the rest of her clothes.</p><p align="left">Rio's heart clenched tighter the moment Miriam's fingers made contact with her skin. </p><p align="left"><em>I shouldn't be doing this. </em>It was the only thought looping in Rio's head.</p><p align="left">She felt like she was cheating on someone, crossing a line she shouldn't. Then her mind drifted to Agatha.</p><p align="left">
<em>Fuck! Agatha!</em>
</p><p align="left">She shouldn't have said all that shit. Mentioning Wanda and that other woman. Acting like Agatha owed her something. She didn't. And what Rio was doing right now—it wasn't any better. If she thought that was bad, somehow, then she was just as bad, if not worse.</p><p align="left">She barely registered the moment Miriam's fingers entered her—foreign, unfamiliar to her body. But she did feel the tears slipping down her eyes.</p><p align="left">Miriam seemed to notice.</p><p align="left">“Fuck, I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?” </p><p align="left">Rio lifted her head, eyes unfocused.</p><p align="left">“No, no, it's not you. Fuck, I need to go.” Rio pulled Miriam's fingers out by herself and immediately stood, her movements frantic. “I'm so fucking sorry. You don't deserve this, but I really need to go.” She threw on her clothes in a hurry, not bothering to button a single button. Then she left, shutting the door behind her.</p><p align="left">The moment she stepped onto the street and the night air hit her face, the tears came—furious, relentless, hot.</p><p align="left">She buttoned half of her shirt with shaky hands, then pulled a cigarette out from her pocket, lit it, and inhaled deeply as she walked, heading home. </p><p align="left">Where was the fucking home?</p><hr/><p align="left">Two streets away, a black car rolled up beside her, moving slowly.</p><p align="left">Rio glanced at it, then she kept walking.</p><p align="left">The window lowered.</p><p align="left">“Rio...”</p><p align="left">She froze mid-step. <em>That</em> voice.</p><p align="left">Then she moved with hurried steps, desperate to escape. She couldn't face her. Not like this. Probably never. She couldn't look into Agatha's gorgeous blue eyes. she couldn't look at her—</p><p align="left">“Rio, please, just listen to me. Come on!”</p><p align="left">Rio didn't answer. Didn't look. But her heart pounded violently in her chest.</p><p align="left">The car stopped abruptly. Then the door slammed open. Rio flinched as Agatha got out, slamming it shut behind her. She grabbed Rio's wrist, not tightly, just enough to pull her closer. Close enough to rest a hand on her hip.</p><p align="left">“Look at me,” Agatha pleaded. “Please, Rio. Just look at me.”</p><p align="left">Rio kept her gaze on Agatha's shoes, unable to meet her eyes.</p><p align="left">Agatha sighed, releasing her wrist only to tilt Rio's face up by the chin.</p><p align="left">The moment she saw the tears, her thumbs brushed them away.“I'm here, okay?” Agatha murmured. “I'm here, Rio.”</p><p align="left">That was it. That was all it took for the dam to break.</p><p align="left">Rio sobbed. Tears blurred everything. Her heart was pounding. Her breaths were being caught in her throat. Her chest was heavily rising and falling down.</p><p align="left">“I fucked this up, didn't I?”</p><p align="left">“No. No, you didn't.”</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled her into a hug, resting Rio's head against her chest, holding her securely.</p><p align="left">“I'm sorry.” Rio gasped between sobs.</p><p align="left">“Shhh. It's okay.”</p><p align="left">Minutes passed.</p><p align="left">When Rio finally pulled back, she looked down at the tear stains on Agatha's light gray jacket before she hesitantly lifted her gaze up.</p><p align="left">Agatha's blue eyes, framed with her glasses, held nothing but concern.</p><p align="left">“I'm really sorry, Agatha.”</p><p align="left">The moment she said it, fresh tears threatened to spill.</p><p align="left">But Agatha cupped her face with both hands in an attempt to steady her.</p><p align="left">“I heard you the first time, Rio. And it's okay. We'll talk about this later. But not now, okay?”</p><p align="left">Rio only nodded.</p><p align="left">Agatha extended her hand. Asking for Rio's hold. “Now come with me?” </p><p align="left">And Rio did, she held Agatha's hand in hers.</p><p align="left">“I like your hair,” Agatha said as she tucked a strand behind Rio's ear.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't immediately understand what Agatha meant until she reached up to touch her hair with the other hand—only to find it much shorter than it had been earlier. A stunned expression took over her face.</p><p align="left">They got into the car. Agatha leaned in to fasten Rio's seatbelt and Rio inhaled deeply, taking in Agatha's heavenly scent, filling her lungs and senses with it.</p><p align="left">Before Agatha could pull away, Rio pressed a kiss to her cheek.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned back into her seat, offering Rio a soft smile.</p><p align="left">
<em>God, her lips looked beautiful. She looked beautiful.</em>
</p><p align="left">That white tank top under her jacket. Her pale skin. Her exposed cleavage. And fuck—glasses? Agatha was wearing glasses.</p><p align="left">It hit Rio then—she hadn't quite registered the object minutes ago, but at that moment? Fuck. Rio felt hot. Agatha was hot. She was.</p><p align="left">“You're wearing glasses.” Rio whispered.</p><p align="left">Agatha glanced at her after starting the engine.</p><p align="left">“Yes. I do, when I'm driving at night,” she said with a smile.</p><p align="left">“They make you look even hotter.”</p><p align="left">Agatha laughed. “You're adorable, you know that?”</p><p align="left">Rio smiled, remembering when Agatha had said the same exact words, at Lilia's house. “Yes, I know.” Rio said, then she shut her eyes as her eyelids grew heavy and her eyes started to burn.</p><p align="left">The safety wrapping her wasn't foreign anymore; it was something she always felt with Agatha. </p><p align="left">She didn't know how many minutes had passed when she opened her eyes again and looked around. She was shocked to see Agatha still driving. They should have been at home by now.</p><p align="left">“Where are we?”</p><p align="left">Agatha glanced at her, smiling softly. “Hey there. I'm taking you to my place.”</p><p align="left">“So, are you kidnapping me?”</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled. “No, I'm not. I can drive us back if you want.”</p><p align="left">Rio shook her head. “No<em>. Take me with you.</em>”</p><p align="left">And she closed her eyes again.</p><p align="left">Rio felt it when the car stopped. Felt it when Agatha got out and shut the door behind her.</p><p align="left">Then, stillness. For a few seconds, or maybe minutes. The next thing she felt was strong arms lifting her with ease.</p><p align="left">Agatha closed the car door with her foot and headed inside. Apparently, she had unlocked the door when <em>the</em> <em>everything stilled</em> a few minutes ago.</p><p align="left">Rio buried her face in Agatha's neck. The sensation was too good to be ignored. To not take advantage of.</p><p align="left">“I can walk, you know,” she mumbled.</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled.</p><p align="left">“I know, baby. Just rest now.”</p><p align="left">And Rio felt it—the steady rhythm of Agatha climbing the stairs, carrying her as if she weighed nothing. </p><p align="left">She didn't open her eyes once, too caught up in the warmth, the breathtaking scent, and exhaustion.</p><p align="left">Agatha placed her gently on the bed, then she moved to take off Rio's shoes and socks. She held her hip with one hand and tugged at Rio's shoulder with the other.</p><p align="left">Rio let out a sleepy “<em>hmm</em>?”</p><p align="left">“Can I take your clothes off?” Agatha whispered.</p><p align="left">Rio nodded. “Yes.” she whispered.</p><p align="left">Agatha's hands roamed over the fabric before she slipped Rio's shirt off. She hadn't expected to be met with bare tanned skin. Agatha looked for a second but her gaze didn't linger. She moved forward, unbuttoning and removing Rio's jeans.</p><p align="left">A minute or two passed. Then Agatha returned, dressing Rio in one of her oversized t-shirts. </p><p align="left">Rio was awake—not entirely. Her eyes remained closed, too heavy to open. She was hoverir between consciousness and unconsciousness, but she still felt every movement. Every soft brush and careful touch.</p><p align="left">Then Agatha pulled the soft duvet over her body.</p><p align="left">Stillness again. No sound at all.</p><p align="left">Minutes passed before Rio felt Agatha climb into bed beside her. Without hesitation, she rolled to the side, pressing her body against Agatha's and resting her head on her chest.</p><p align="left">Agatha kissed her head. Once. Twice. Then she pulled Rio even closer.</p><p align="left">Rio couldn't understand what Agatha murmured before pressing another kiss to her hair as the sound of Agatha's heartbeat lulled her to sleep.</p>

<p>Chapter Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I know I'm turning this into some typical lesbian drama, but I won't justify or explain anything Rio or Agatha did. That is just who they are, at least in my head. They're messy. They don't communicate in a healthy way. They're not straightforward. They won't just say what they actually want to say. Because yeah, people need to get used to each other before doing that, but they'll figure it out eventually though.</p><p>I know we're going up and down but this is going to have a happy ending.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Falling.<br/>Falling.</p><p>She keeps on falling.<br/>Into nothingness.</p><p>Trapped in a cycle, isn't she? Unable to distinguish between its ending and starting point.<br/>Perhaps it ended a while ago, and she didn't know, and now she's repeating it all over again.</p><p>Falling and falling again.</p><p>Rio's heart raced, cold sweat dripping over her body. A ringing sound filled her ears, making her dizzier, creating a nauseating sensation in her stomach, the urge to vomit her soul out.</p><p>The sound grew louder and louder, weakening her, making it impossible to comprehend a single thing.</p><p>Her breaths were heavy and uneven, as if someone was choking her. She opened her eyes in fear and pain because not a single part of her body was functioning, as if she had lost all control over herself. Her eyes were open but everything was black—nothing but darkness surrounding her. She blinked, then blinked again but to no avail. She was completely frozen, unable to move a finger. Her body shut down, and she was laying somewhere. Was she? Maybe she was floating, or drowning. </p><p>“Hey, hey. Follow my voice, yeah? Just breathe. Try to breathe. I've got you.”</p><p>She heard the voice. Tried to make sense of the words passing through the ringing. Some of them blended with it, almost making her ears bleed.</p><p>She couldn't quite grasp whose voice it was. Who was holding her? Who's cold touch she could feel little of on her numb body?</p><p>“It's okay. You're okay.”</p><p>The ringing gradually grew quieter, and her vision started to clear. There was a source of light on her side, blurry and almost too bright, but far better than the baleful darkness that had overwhelmed her eyesight moments ago.</p><p>As if someone had removed the weight from her chest, she could inhale properly again. The moment she breathed in, a scent filled her half-working senses and her entire body, Agatha's. That thought was the only clear one in her mind, and it warmed her. Knowing that her head had been resting on Agatha's chest almost the entire time. Knowing that Agatha's arm was supporting her, securing her at the waist. Knowing that the touches she'd felt seconds ago weren't cold, but warm and soothing—warming her chilled skin.</p><p>“You're doing really well. Just keep breathing.”</p><p>And she did. Rio tried to breathe as Agatha's voice counted softly. With each number, her voice held certainty and reassurance.</p><p>Agatha's fingers began stroking her hair gently while holding Rio—as if she was the most precious thing in the world.</p><p>The moment Rio regained control over her body and could move her muscles, she lifted her arms higher, reaching for Agatha's middle, holding her tightly as she pressed her head into Agatha's chest. She needed to feel her. To ensure that Agatha was really there and that whatever had gone wrong could be fixed.</p><p>“There you go.” </p><p>Agatha's hand, once on her waist, moved higher, drawing invisible, soothing patterns on Rio's back above the fabric. Her other hand continued to stroke her hair gently.</p><p>Rio inhaled deeply through her nose, the air was flavored with Agatha, making Rio more awake and aware of everything around her. She pulled back slightly as she exhaled, and was met with Agatha's gleaming eyes, the light beside her was making them glimmer, as if actual stars were in there—making her beautiful eyes even more mesmerizing.</p><p>Looking into Agatha's eyes felt like gazing at the blue ocean on a starry night. A night you knew would stick with you forever.</p><p>Agatha locked eyes with Rio as she extended her hand to reach for the glass of water on thr nightstand, not breaking the eye contact. Then she held it up for Rio to drink.</p><p>Rio hadn't had a panic attack in her sleep for a long time. She thought she had gotten rid of them by doing absolutely nothing. But thinking about it, it was actually that she hadn't slept enough lately to have one. She always woke up before it could even happen. </p><p>The thought of having it now, of all times, made her feel an uneasy sensation growing inside her. Because why?</p><p>Before she could overthink the entire situation, Agatha's thumb brushed Rio's lips slightly, as they kept looking at each other while she cupped Rio's cheek. Rio moved her hand and rested it above Agatha's as she whispered.</p><p>“I'm sorry.” Her whisper broke the stillness of the night for a brief second.</p><p>“Don't apologize.” Agatha's voice was warm and deep as she continued brushing Rio's soft lips, touching them tenderly, which caused Rio's lips to part instinctively.</p><p>“How are you feeling?”</p><p>“I'm... good now.” Rio answered, still whispering, her eyes remained fixed on Agatha's.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it?” Agatha said as her fingers moved to hold the back of Rio's neck, brushing the little hairs there as Rio's hand dropped slightly to rest on Agatha's wrist.</p><p>“Can we do that later?” Rio said, her other hand held Agatha's hip tighter.</p><p>“Whenever you want.” Agatha took Rio's hand and pressed a kiss to the back of it.</p><p>“Let's get back to sleep?” Agatha suggested and Rio nodded in response.</p><p>For minutes, they just kept looking at each other's faces, without moving an inch to actually lie back down. They felt the tender touches as each of their hands rested in different places, soothing the skin beneath.</p><p>Then they finally lay down. Bodies pressed against each other. Arms secured around each other's middles. As they tried to be as close as possible, leaving no space between them. Their legs tangled together under the covers as if they were puzzle pieces, fitting perfectly in place.</p><p>Their senses were filled with each other's scents. They found peace in the close proximity between them. It felt like home, as if this was the only natural and right thing to do—a place where Rio felt she belonged. In Agatha's presence. In being held by her like this. Almost feeling her running with her blood, in her veins. </p><p>Rio managed to close her eyes, but sleep didn't find its way to her. Minutes passed. Then more minutes, but she couldn't fall asleep. Despite the headache that felt like a time bomb ticking in her skull. Despite how her eyes burned. Despite the peace Agatha's embrace, her steady breaths and heartbeats provided, she couldn't. She felt exhausted, and the only thing she could do was bury her face deeper into Agatha's neck. Feeling the warmth of her skin.</p><p>“Don't hold your breath.” Agatha said as her hold around Rio's middle tightened. Rio's heart jumped; she thought Agatha had fallen back asleep because of how quiet she was.</p><p>Rio let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding against Agatha's skin.</p><p>“That's better,” Agatha whispered as her fingers moved higher, running through Rio's hair. </p><p>“What's the happiest memory from your childhood?” Rio asked out of nowhere, as her fingers began to wander on Agatha's t-shirt.</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, and Rio smiled at the sound. She lifted her head slightly to be able to look at Agatha. </p><p>“Well, I have a favorite one.” Agatha said after a few seconds as she resumed stroking Rio's hair. “I was seven. My family's house used to be near the woods, and I was allowed to go in there for an hour every weekend. The rule was not to go too deep—there was a mark I wasn't supposed to cross. My mother tied a blue ribbon on one of the trees. But I actually broke that rule every time.” Agatha chuckled, and so did Rio.</p><p>“So, one day, I was there singing to our mother nature, pretending to have an audience. I always dreamed of having an audience to watch me. To watch whatever I was doing—even doing the simplest things. So yeah, I was singing, almost certain no one was there. And a woman walked toward me and I froze in my place. Almost had a heart attack, really. I'm easy to get scared. So, then I recognized her—she was our neighbor. So she approached me and asked how I knew this song and she said that I had a lovely voice with the biggest smile on her face, a basket filled with mushrooms in her hand. I told her my mother sang it and she was so happy when I told her that. She told me her mother used to sing the same exact song to her. Then... I sang the same song all the way back home, I'm sure I gave her a headache but she didn't seem to mind in the slightest. She was my only audience. So... This memory is the first thing I think of when I hear the words childhood and happiness together.” Agatha took a breath, kept it in her lungs for a while, then she exhaled deeply. “That woman... she changed my life in a way.”</p><p>Rio lifted her head to look directly into Agatha's eyes. The expression she found there was indescribable. Softness and peacefulness.</p><p>“You wanted to be a singer?”</p><p>“No, not really. I probably did when I was a kid, back when I had a hundred dream jobs,” Agatha said as she gazed at Rio's face with tenderness and care and her hand continued delicately running through Rio's short hair, offering warmth and reassurance.</p><p>“What's yours?”</p><p>Rio smiled as she started replaying the memory she had in mind when she asked the question in her head. It was a little blurry, so she tried to enhance the images without mixing them.</p><p>“My father and I were fishing. I mostly used to sit and watch him, but that time, I decided to try it myself, and I caught my first fish ever. It wasn't big, but I was really happy with it. The moment I felt the rod move in my hands as the fish pulled, I lost my control over it. So... The fish pulled <em>too</em> hard, and I kept pulling forward until I lost my balance and fell into the water. My father hurried to pull me up, but I was only laughing. I ran toward the rod and looked at the fish, at that time... it felt like my biggest victory. I held it in my hands all the way home, just... staring at it. When we got back, I remember lifting it up for my mother to see. I was smiling and soaking wet. I didn't even realize I was shivering until my mother wrapped me in a blanket.” Rio lowered her gaze to Agatha's lips for a brief second before returning to her eyes. “She cooked it for dinner, and it really was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted.”</p><p>Rio smiled—a wide, genuine smile—as she kept reliving the memory in her head. The voices, the images, the feelings. It had been many years, but it lingered, alive and growing inside her. Just like every beautiful memory with them.</p><p>Agatha smiled in return—a bright smile that could illuminate and warm the whole world, but Rio's heart took it all, felt it all inside her.</p><p>“I'm trying to picture a younger you. Did you have short hair?”</p><p>Rio slightly shook her head, still smiling. “It was long. I inherited my mother's hair.”</p><p>Their eyes stayed locked. Their smiles didn't fade; they only grew wider. The silence was comforting, the air was thick with serenity.</p><p>Then the urge surged. The urge to kiss Agatha.</p><p>Rio's heart pounded as she leaned in, their lips almost touching. A mixture of emotions rushed through her body, dozens of memories flashing in her mind—the highs and lows of yesterday. Vivid and clear, every sound and image. She wasn't even sure if what she did had been real. It felt unreal.</p><p>Her heart raced, her thoughts and feelings were colliding. Instead of placing a hand on her chest to calm herself, she crashed her lips into Agatha's. Took her lips softly at first but then it heated. The kiss was everything. It was an apology. An explanation. A promise. But it was also hurt, guilt, and shame.</p><p>Her hand moved higher, to the back of Agatha's neck, as Agatha kissed her back with the same intensity. Rio pulled her even closer, deepening the kiss, exploring the depths of Agatha's mouth with her tongue. It was intense, and each passing second made her skin burn hotter. Her stomach clenched every time she sucked on Agatha's tongue. </p><p>She shifted, moving on top of Agatha, her hands were roaming on her body, unable to find a place to land—she wanted it all. To touch every part of Agatha at once.</p><p>But Agatha pulled back the next second, her breaths were rapid and heavy. “<em>Rio...</em>” She panted.</p><p>Rio looked at her while trying to catch her own breath.</p><p>“<em>Hmm</em>?” She hummed in response.</p><p>“We need to talk.” Agatha whispered. Her eyes stayed locked on Rio's, her hands were moving up and down her hips. Their faces were <em>too</em> close.</p><p>Rio looked at her.</p><p>Yes, they needed to talk. She wandered why had Agatha even let her kiss her in the first place?</p><p>Rio nodded, then she lowered herself, sitting back against the headboard. Agatha propped herself up on her elbows, looking at Rio beside her.</p><p>Rio found herself looking around Agatha's room for the first time. She knew she was here, but it had only just hit her. There wasn't much light to observe, but she could make out details here and there. The windows were covered with Russian Velvet curtains, allowing little to no moonlight to seep into the room</p><p>Her eyes wandered, landing on a dark-colored chaise longue at the foot of the bed, beside which sat a small wooden table. Two mugs rested on it, along with some scattered papers and a pencil. Despite the room's spaciousness, it wasn't filled with much. An antique Victorian vanity stood against the wall, feeling somewhat out of place. A few boxes sat stacked in the corner.</p><p>A dim light flickered from what Rio assumed was the walk-in wardrobe.</p><p>She wandered the room for quite some time, feeling Agatha's eyes on her. Finally, Rio turned and met her gaze. A second later, Agatha sat beside her, taking Rio's hand in hers and looking at it. </p><p>“Are you hungry?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Do you want something?”</p><p>“Some coffee would be really great. And I really need to go to the bathroom.”</p><p>“Okay, come on then,” Agatha said, pressing a kiss to the back of Rio's hand.</p><p>As Rio stood, she suddenly became aware of what she was wearing—Agatha's t-shirt. She lowered her gaze. It was black, falling just above her knees, with the cover of Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret by Soft Cell printed across the front.</p><p>Smiling, she looked at Agatha.</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Nothing.” Rio's smile turned into a wide smirk.</p><p>“Oh, come on! I can have band t-shirts!”</p><p>“I didn't say anything!” Rio chuckled, throwing up her hands in defense.</p><p>“Yeah? And I also said nothing when you gave me that Siouxsie and the Banshees t-shirt.”</p><p>At that, Rio burst into laughter. “I really tried to give you the least weird t-shirt I had.”</p><p>Agatha smiled at her, and then they walked out of the room. She showed Rio where the bathroom was and the place of everything she might need and told her to find her in the kitchen afterward.</p><hr/><p>Once she stepped out and closed the door behind her, Rio made her way down the hallway toward the stairs. She was surprised by how empty the walls were. For some reason, she had expected paintings to be hanging everywhere. </p><p>A half-opened door caught her attention. She walked past it, then instinctively took a few steps back. Standing in the doorway, Rio peered inside, only able to see what the angle of the door allowed. Agatha's studio.</p><p>She stepped inside without pushing the door open any further.</p><p>Her eyes scanned the finished paintings—faces she didn't recognize, abstracts she couldn't analyze properly with her headache. Empty canvases filled most of the space, alongside boxes overflowing with supplies. </p><p>Rio took it all in for a second longer before stepping back. Stunned. Agatha was really good. </p><p>As she turned to leave, her gaze landed on a painting she knew all too well.</p><p><em>Hers</em>.</p><p>It leaned against the white wall, her features were captured in oil paint, every detail was perfectly placed, as if she were looking into a mirror. Rio stepped closer. Looking closer. Her neck and collarbone were exposed, her skin tone matched precisely, and her dark hair cascaded down her back. She hadn't notice those details the first time she saw the painting—because they hadn't been there before. The rest of the painting remained unfinished, or perhaps it was meant to be that way.</p><p>Her fingers traced over the brushstrokes of her face as she stared in quiet awe.</p><p>She took slow steps backward, still looking at the painting, when her back hit something wooden—a table. </p><p>Rio turned her entire body to look at the object. Her eyes landed on an opened sketchbook, a pencil and a black pen resting in its center. Her name was written at the top of the page, and beneath it, a sketch of her body.</p><p>Rio's mouth ran dry.</p><p>She recognized the pose immediately. </p><p>Yesterday morning, when Agatha had asked her to lift her leg.</p><p>She swallowed hard, her eyes lingered on the careful attention given to the curves of her body in the sketch. Every time she looked at it, she found a new calculated detail—things Rio hadn't even noticed on her own body before. She turned to the previous page, only to find her name again and a sketch of her back. That must have been what Agatha was looking at yesterday.</p><p>A thrill ran through Rio's entire body, leaving flames in its wake. Her stomach was nothing but a mixture of burns, and her head was a mess. The thought of someone looking at her <em>so</em> closely, memorizing her in that way and drawing her with such precision filled her with exhilaration. It made her heart pound with intoxication.</p><p>
<em>Oh. God.</em>
</p><p>Rio closed the sketchebook with a panic as she heard a sound from downstairs. She set it back on the table after several, long seconds of staring and wetting her lips. She shut her eyes and took a deep breath. The air that entered her lungs smelled like paint, making her dizzy for a moment. Without a second glance, Rio stepped outside and closed the door behind her.</p><p>She hurried toward the stairs, feeling her heart pounding in her chest.</p><p>Was that something she wasn't supposed to see? Too late. She had seen it, and now she felt like she might actually faint.</p><p>Descending the stairs, she searched for the kitchen—only to find Agatha sitting there, waiting for her, two mugs of coffee set in front of her on the wooden table.</p><p>Rio's face was flushed. Seeing Agatha only made her heart race faster. She swallowed hard, her eyes lingered on Agatha's face—her ocean-blue eyes, that beautiful, <em>beautiful</em> smile that was resting on her lips.</p><p>Agatha motioned for her to sit in the chair beside her and Rio obeyed. Walking over as she tried to calm her racing heart, steadying her breaths with each step. Then she sat down, wrapping her hands around the warm, brown, ceramic mug as she felt Agatha's gaze on her, watching her side profile. </p><p>They sat in silence for minutes, simply just existing in each other's presence. Only the soft sipping sounds broke the quiet.</p><p>But inside Rio? There was a conflict she had no solution for.</p><p>She set her mug down, staring at the steam raising up. She hoped Agatha would speak—ask something, say something, anything to break the tension. But she knew Agatha was waiting.</p><p>Waiting for her to be ready to talk.</p><p>Before she could overthink it, the words slipped from her lips.</p><p>“Were you coming to my house yesterday?” Rio asked as she kept her eyes glued to the mug in front of her. Staring at how it was crafted.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha's gaze never wavered.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“To see you.”</p><p>“No. I mean why? After everything I did and said?” Rio finally looked up at Agatha, meeting her eyes. “It's not fair to you. I was out of my mind really. I'm not trying to make excuses... I said all that to you, and then I went and just did...”</p><p>She broke their eye contact, shifting her gaze back to the mug in her hands, overwhelmed by Agatha's steady stare.</p><p>“Did what?”</p><p>Rio's grip on the handle tightened. Her mind flooded with blurred footages and flashes of last night—when she acted like the reckless, drunk, loser she was.</p><p>Her other hand ran through her hair as if searching for something, anything, to ground her. To ease the nervousness. And she once again realized how short her hair was.</p><p>“I—I was really drunk... I wasn't thinking.” She closed her eyes briefly. “I don't even know how I left the house or how I made it to where I wanted to go.” She inhaled through her nose, then sighed heavily.“I got my hair cut... Then I... God, I found myself fucking the hairdresser on her bed...” The words barely escaped her lips. Shame and guilt burned in her stomach.</p><p>“When I finally became aware of it... I just left. I left her sitting there without a second glance.”</p><p>Silence stretched between them once she finished talking.</p><p>Rio's leg bounced wildly under the table. She was waiting—for a comment, a reaction, anything. She was ready to be judged. Ready for someone to point out her recklessness.</p><p>But when Agatha finally spoke, it wasn't what Rio expected. “How are you feeling about it?”</p><p>Rio's head snapped up the moment she heard Agatha's voice.</p><p>Had she even heard what Rio just said?</p><p>“About what?” Rio asked, her voice came out small, barely above a whisper. </p><p>Agatha reached out, resting a hand on Rio's thigh, stilling the frantic movement of her leg. At that point, Rio wasn't just bouncing her leg, her entire body was trembling, shaking the wooden table as if warning of an impending earthquake.</p><p>“About it all. How are you feeling?”</p><p>Rio bit her bottom lip as she looked into Agatha's eyes. “I shouldn't have done it. What I said to you... what I did afterward. It just felt... It felt so wrong. It didn't at the time, god, but when I became aware of it, I just... I hated myself for it. And I know it wasn't me. I mean, it was—I did it. But in a way, I didn't. I don't know.” She sighed, shaking her head. “And I'm really not making up excuses. I know that even the idea of it is fucked enough, and I know I probably look like a fool right now.”</p><p>“You don't, Rio.” Agatha's voice was firm yet gentle. “You don't look like a fool. I know what you're talking about.”</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>“Yes. I understand why you did it, and I'm not judging you for it, Rio. I know it makes you feel like you're the worst, but it's okay. Because you're not. You're not the worst and everything is totally fine.” Agatha's fingers absentmindedly traced gentle strokes along Rio's exposed thigh as she spoke.</p><p>Her voice softened even more.“I just want you to let me in. <em>Will you let me in</em>?” </p><p>Rio looked at her, unsure of what exactly Agatha was asking, but at the same time, she did know. Because the same question was hanging on the tip of her own tongue.</p><p>“Yes.” She answered, her eyes tracing Agatha's calm, beautiful features. Then, before she could stop herself, she asked.“<em>But will you</em>?” A rush ran through her body the moment she voiced the question out loud and her heart pounded.</p><p>Agatha smiled slightly. “You're already in, Rio.” Her hand moved higher, brushing Rio's cheek with the back of her hand.</p><p>“Am I?”</p><p>“Yes, you are.”</p><p>“Then why didn't you answer me yesterday?”</p><p>“Because I told you, Rio. I wanted to talk to you while you were sober and in front of me.”</p><p>She did?</p><p>Oh. Yes, she actually did say that. </p><p>Agatha stood up from her chair, looking down at Rio. “Come on. This chair will hurt your back.” </p><p>Rio glanced up at her, then she gulped down what was left in her mug before she rose to her feet.</p><p>They walked through the hallway, heading toward the living room. It was by far the biggest space with much more furniture than what Rio had already seen. Most of it was plain white, but the dark-colored and wooden pieces balanced the space, making it look effortlessly beautiful.</p><p>A large bookshelf lined one of the walls, filled with books. Just from a glance, Rio recognized a title or two. Next to it, a display cabinet held DVDs and vinyl records, with a stereo sitting on top. A white stone fireplace stood against another wall, sculptures resting on the shelf above it.</p><p>The seating area featured a dark-charcoal couch set and small, vintage, wooden coffee tables. </p><p>Two paintings hung on different walls—none Rio recognized, but the larger one caught her attention. She made a mental note to take a closer look at it later. A single plant stood in the room—a large philodendrons in a dark brown ceramic vase. The only touch of greenery she had seen so far.</p><p>They sat beside each other. Agatha tucked her legs under herself. Rio's leg were cold, causing her to shiver slightly—almost unnoticeably, but Agatha noticed. Without a word, she grabbed the wool blanket draped over the couch arm and placed it over Rio's legs.</p><p>“Do you want me to get you something else to wear?”</p><p>“No, that's okay.”</p><p>They looked at each other for a few silent seconds before Agatha finally spoke.</p><p>“So, you said you saw Wanda at your birthday. I... don't really know why she was there or <em>what</em> she had told you, but I think you should hear it from me.” Rio listened intently as Agatha continued.</p><p>“It wasn't pleasant. We broke up on bad terms. We hadn't been a... <em>real</em> couple for two years—we were just pretending. Until last year, when we finally ended it for good.” Agatha tucked a strand of her dark hair behind her ear. “And the other woman, Vic...” She paused briefly. “Yes, I slept with her.”</p><p>“were you...”</p><p>“No.” Agatha shook her head. “We weren't a thing, if that's what you're asking.”</p><p>Rio intertwined her fingers in her lap, locking them together so tightly that her knuckles turned slightly white. </p><p>“When was the last time you saw her?” Rio couldn't help herself, she needed to know.</p><p>Agatha reached over, gently taking one of Rio's hands and securing it between her own.</p><p>“Before I went to Paris. I told her I wouldn't be seeing her anymore.”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly. Her body visibly relaxed and tension drained from her muscles. She could finally breathe properly.</p><p>She looked into Agatha's eyes and what she found there made her feel safe. Certain. As if she were staring directly into the ocean—calm waves stretching infinitely before her.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand gently before asking,</p><p>“What about your ex? What's her problem?” She intertwined their fingers, waiting for Rio's answer.</p><p>“She's insane. That's her problem,” Rio said as she leaned closer to Agatha, desperate to feel her warmth. She wanted to be held but couldn't find it in herself to ask. Just the mention of her ex made her feel sick. The reminder that she existed filled her with nausea. </p><p>“Yeah, she is.” Agatha placed a hand on the back of Rio's neck. “Whatever she said to you, Rio. It's not true.” She whispered, their faces drawing even closer. Rio closed her eyes. The sound of Agatha's voice was so calm, soft and soothing. </p><p>“<em>Kiss me,</em>” Rio said, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Agatha met her gaze before leaning in and capturing Rio's lips in a kiss. It was soft and gentle. A kiss that made Rio's heart dance in her chest. Agatha kissed her deliberately, both hands cradling the back of Rio's neck, pulling her closer as she deepened the kiss. Rio let out a whimper when Agatha's tongue entered her mouth, intensifying the heat between them, sharing the lingering taste of coffee. </p><p>A moan escaped Rio as Agatha gently pushed her down, guiding her to lie back against the couch and her head rested on the armrest. Their lips never parted—the kiss only grew more intense. Their hands roamed each other's bodies, desperate to touch, to hold, to grasp onto something tangible.</p><p>They pulled back slightly when breathing became a necessity. Agatha's hand continued exploring Rio's body over the fabric of her clothes, her chest rising and falling as she struggled to steady her breaths.</p><p>Rio looked up at her, utterly mesmerized. Agatha looked breathtaking—her flushed skin, the way her chest heaved, the sheer intensity in her gaze. Rio wanted to worship her. </p><p>She placed both hands on Agatha's hips, sliding them up and down as she gazed into her eyes. But Agatha stilled her movements, placing her hands over Rio's.</p><p>“Let me take care of you,” Agatha murmured as she lowered her hands and cupped Rio's breasts.</p><p>Rio let out a soft moan at the touch, her nipples were already hard beneath the material. She nodded eagerly, because, <em>god</em>, she wanted Agatha to take care of her. In every way possible.</p><p>Agatha leaned in again, crashing their lips together as her hands squeezed Rio's breasts. Waves of heat pulsed through Rio's body, one after another, pooling in her stomach and between her thighs. She moaned into Agatha's mouth as she felt a hand traveling lower, cupping her heated cunt through the thin fabric of her underwear.</p><p>“<em>Oh, fuck.</em>” </p><p>Agatha's index and middle fingers moved up and down her slit, teasing, torturing. Rio could feel herself dripping with every passing second. The slow, deliberate movements of Agatha's long fingers against her soaked underwear made her body shudder, her stomach clench, her head grow dizzy. And she loved it. She loved the teasing, the way Agatha's fingers mapped her desire.</p><p>Agatha pulled back slightly, watching Rio intently as she withdrawn her hands. Then she kissed Rio's forehead.</p><p>Rio barely had time to whine at the loss of contact before Agatha reached for the hem of her own t-shirt. Pulling it over her head.</p><p>Rio's breath hitched. </p><p>Staring at the pale captivating skin. The curve of her waist. The way her breasts were cradled by a deep purple bra, her hardened nipples visible through the fabric. The sight made Rio moan, it was too good to not be appreciated. </p><p>Agatha smirked slightly before reaching for the hem of Rio's shirt, lifting it over her head and tossing it aside and Rio was left in only her black underwear.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, placing a soft kiss on Rio's lips before trailing her mouth down to her neck. She kissed, nipped and sucked at the sensitive skin, leaving Rio a moaning mess beneath her. </p><p>Both of Agatha's hands cupped Rio's bare breasts, rolling the nipples with her fingers, drawing out of her throat even more sounds soaked in pleasure.</p><p>She kissed her way down, giving every inch of exposed skin the attention it deserved. As if Rio's body were a canvas and Agatha was painting on it, not with a brush, but with her mouth. </p><p>When Agatha reached the waistband of Rio's underwear, she hooked her fingers around it and pulled it down. Slowly revealing the dark curls beneath.</p><p>She pressed a final kiss to Rio's abdomen before settling herself between her thighs.</p><p>She opened Rio's legs wide enough for herself. Agatha looked at Rio who was already watching her, one arm was resting behind her head, her armpit hair peeking out, her face was flushed, her chest was rising and falling with heavy breaths. Agatha smirked.</p><p>“You look so fucking beautiful... So goddamn beautiful it drives me <em>insane</em>.” </p><p>She traced a finger along Rio's slit.</p><p>“Since the first I saw you... God, you looked so beautiful.”</p><p>The same finger slipped inside with ease, gliding in effortlessly with how wet Rio was already. Agatha thrusted in and out, marveling at how Rio's cunt swallowed her finger so perfectly, coating it with more silky wetness every time. </p><p>Rio moaned loudly as a second finger joined the first, pumping inside her.</p><p>“Oh my fucking god.”</p><p>“You're taking my fingers so well,”  Agatha murmured, her gaze never left Rio's. She started to thrust faster, deeper, hitting that g-spot with every stroke, feeling Rio's warm walls clench around her fingers. </p><p>Rio closed her eyes for a brief second.</p><p>“No, no, angel. Look at me. Keep looking at me while I fuck you like this. You're taking me so well.”</p><p>“<em>Oh, Agatha—</em>” Rio moaned out her name in response.</p><p>Agatha kept thrusting as her thumb found the swollen, throbbing clit, circling it, pushing Rio even closer.</p><p>The pleasure was building at an unbearable speed. Intense and searing.</p><p>With a few more thrusts of Agatha's slender fingers, Rio shattered, moaning Agatha's name as if it was salvation. </p><p>Agatha kissed the inside of Rio's thigh, sending a shiver to run through Rio's sensitive body. Then she moved up, slipping her fingers into Rio's mouth. And Rio groaned around them, sucking them clean.</p><p>Sucking herself clean off of Agatha.</p><p>Agatha leaned in and kissed Rio's lips—tasting the sweetness of her and Agatha moaned. “If you don't mind... I need to taste that directly from the source.”</p><p>Settling between Rio's legs, Agatha lifted them both and placed them on her shoulders. She inhaled deeply, drowning in Rio's scent. It was strong and intoxicating. Without wasting any second, Agatha leaned in and devoured.</p><p>The sound of Agatha's mouth sucking against the wetness of Rio's cunt mixed with the moans and curses spilling from Rio's lips, filled the space and their ears.</p><p>Agatha sucked on the throbbing clit for a few more times and Rio came all over her face. Her orgasm tore through her. </p><p>Despite how Rio's body was trembling, Agatha didn't stop—she kept sucking. Drinking in every drop, making Rio's cunt feel as if it had never been wet in the first place. Only when she was fully satisfied did she lift her head and her lips were curled up in a smile. </p><p>Agatha's mouth and chin glistened with Rio's arousal. She ran her tongue along her lips, the length of it reaching the last traces of Rio on her chin.</p><p>Rio moaned at the sight as her eye flutteref.</p><p>“<em>Jesus, Agatha</em>.” Her chest was heavily rising and falling. Still trying to catch her breath. </p><p>Agatha looked at her, smug.</p><p>“Do you think you can sleep now?” </p><p>“Huh?” Rio blinked, still lost in the haze.</p><p>“Is your body exhausted enough to finally let you fall asleep?”</p><p>Rio blinked again.</p><p>“I think so.” Her eyelids felt impossibly heavy.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>“But I haven't tasted you yet,” She whined.</p><p>“When you wake up, angel. Please, you need to sleep.” Agatha said as she cupped Rio's face with one hand.</p><p>“I haven't even seen you,” Rio pouted.</p><p>“I know, when you wake up, you can do whatever you want, I promise.” Agatha leaned in, kissing Rio's pouted lips. “Do you have to work today?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Good. Let's get you upstairs.”</p><p>Agatha helped Rio up. She guided her upstairs, gave her fresh set of clothes and dressed her with gentle hands. Then she lay beside her, wrapping Rio in a warm embrace.</p><p>As the sun began to rise. Rio finally fell asleep.</p>

<p align="left">Rio opened her eyes instantly and was met with an unfamiliar ceiling, golden lines tracing its edges. She blinked several times, trying to pull herself from sleep. Then she heard it—her phone buzzing nearby. <em>Alice</em>.</p><p align="left">Oh yeah, that would explain whatever the fuck she'd been dreaming about a few minutes ago.</p><p align="left">Rio looked to the other side, where Agatha was supposed to be, but she wasn't there. Her laptop was open, sitting on the bed, illuminating the room with the faint glow of its screen.</p><p align="left">Rio rubbed her eyes in an attempt to erase the burning in them and sat back against the headboard after grabbing her phone.</p><p align="left">“Hey,” she greeted, her voice was thick with sleep.</p><p align="left">“Hey, dude. Where have you been?”</p><p align="left">“I took the day off.”</p><p align="left">“And also the day before. Rio, what the hell is going on?”</p><p align="left">“Nothing is going on. What do you mean?”</p><p align="left">“God. I've sent you like ten messages this morning.”</p><p align="left">“I haven't seen them.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, that much is obvious. Are you at home? I want to talk to you about something.”</p><p align="left">“No, I'm not home.”</p><p align="left">“Where are you then?” Alice said as Rio heard the sound of keys jangling on the other end.</p><p align="left">Rio glanced around Agatha's room and smiled. Well, where was she? She was <em>here</em>.</p><p align="left">“With a friend.”</p><p align="left">“A friend? Vidal, I know all your friends.”</p><p align="left">“No you don't!” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p align="left">At the same time, her eyes drifted to the doorway—she felt eyes on her. Agatha entered the room with a bright smile, gracefully walking toward the bed as she mouthed <em>Hey</em> before sitting beside Rio.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her and smiled, her heart started to beat a little faster.</p><p align="left">God, this woman...</p><p align="left">“Hey! Vidal! Are you with me?” Alice raised her voice to grab Rio's attention back as the sound of a fridge opening and closing filled Rio's ear.</p><p align="left">“Don't yell! I'm with you. I'll see you tonight, and then we'll talk.”</p><p align="left">“What do you mean <em>tonight</em>? It's already ten pm. Where the fuck are you, Vidal?”</p><p align="left">“What? Ten pm?” Rio asked, stunned.</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled beside her and nodded in affirmation.</p><p align="left">“Yes! Did someone kidnap you or something?”</p><p align="left">“No, shut up. I was asleep.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, are you coming to work tomorrow or what?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, sure.”</p><p align="left">“That <em>sure</em> does not sound convincing <em>at all</em>. But I still need to talk to you tomorrow, okay?”</p><p align="left">“Okay.”</p><p align="left">“Alright, I'll see you. Good night.”</p><p align="left">“Good night, Alice.” </p><p align="left">Rio held her phone in her hand and looked at Agatha with a soft smile.</p><p align="left">“Why didn't you wake me?”</p><p align="left">“I... Well, I couldn't find it in myself to do so.” Agatha softly said. After a beat of silence, she resumed. “You looked... Peaceful. So I couldn't disturb that.” </p><p align="left">Rio blushed instantly. Her cheeks turned a soft pink as a delightful wave of heat ran through her body. There was something about hearing those words come out of Agatha's mouth. It was the way she said them, the tone she used, it made Rio's heart race in her chest.</p><p align="left">She smiled fondly as she looked at Agatha. “If I hadn't been dreaming about adding extra tongues to my sandwich, I wouldn't have woken up.”</p><p align="left">“What?” Agatha asked with a chuckle.</p><p align="left">“Yes, that's what I was doing. I was about to order <em>that</em>,” Rio said, still in disbelief of the absurdity of her dream.</p><p align="left">Agatha laughed—the sound was so beautiful to heat. The most melodic sound to grace the human ear. It was rich and soft and so goddamn captivating.</p><p align="left">“Do you think it's probably because you haven't eaten anything today?” Agatha asked, her smile was audible in her voice.</p><p align="left">“Maybe.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, come on then. Let's eat,” Agatha said as she gently took hold of Rio's hand.</p><p align="left">“You haven't eaten yet?”</p><p align="left">“No. Now come on.”</p><p align="left">Rio got up from the bed that wasn't hers—the bed that let her sleep peacefully because it was so full of Agatha. Full of warmth and safety—things she couldn't even feel in her own bed.</p><p align="left">She went to the bathroom, washed her face, and brushed her teeth with the extra toothbrush Agatha had given her in the morning. Then she slipped on the black shorts Agatha had handed her and together they went downstairs.</p><p align="left">Agatha told her to sit down and wait a few minutes until dinner was ready, but Rio didn't listen. She followed her to the kitchen, curious about what Agatha had cooked for them.</p><p align="left">“It smells delicious. What is it?” Rio asked from behind, as Agatha checked on the chicken in the oven.</p><p align="left">Agatha turned around and looked at Rio. “I told you to sit down,” She said with a soft smile.</p><p align="left">“I don't want to,” Rio replied, reflecting Agatha's smile—i it wasn't even wider.</p><p align="left">She felt a rush of energy pulsing through her body—like a kid on a sugar high, with nothing to do but run and jump and babble. Or maybe it wasn't that. Maybe it was the sense of freedom she felt in Agatha's house. The sense of safety, familiarity, <em>belonging</em>. It felt strange, but in a good way.</p><p align="left">It was peaceful by all means.</p><p align="left">These walls didn't feel depressed or heavy with melancholy. They weren't laughing at her, mocking her, or watching her with strange eyes. They weren't hunting. They were just that... <em>walls</em>.</p><p align="left">Rio watched as Agatha moved around the kitchen, preparing everything and adding the last touches.</p><p align="left">She fought the urge to rest her hands on Agatha's hips. Fought the urge to lean her chin on Agatha's shoulder and watch her adding this and that. But the hardest battle of all was fighting the urge to kiss her.</p><p align="left">Purple really was Agatha's color. She looked like a goddess. Somehow, that shade made her eyes look even bluer and that Rio want to drown in them. Her lips were pink—more succulent and covetable. And <em>fuck</em>, why did the ropy veins darken so much under her pale skin that much?</p><p align="left">In simple words, Agatha looked delicious and Rio was struggling not to take a bite of the sweet treat her body craved.</p><p align="left">She was aware of their kisses—of the many heated moments they'd shared, each one had awakened something deep inside her. She remembered every time Agatha touched her and made her cum undone. Every time she had the chance to feel Agatha's skin. Rio was keeping a count of them in her head. She thought about the way Agatha called her <em>baby</em> or when she called her <em>angel</em>.</p><p align="left">But at that moment... it felt different. Rio didn't know if Agatha wanted to be kissed or to be touched. These were just thoughts swirling in Rio's mind—urges she was keeping locked inside. Because in her head, there was no reasonable excuse to jump and crash her lips against Agatha's, even if every nerve in her body begged for it.</p><p align="left">Her hesitation had roots. Rio had been kissed and touched against her will—by strangers, by past lovers. She knew what it was like to be forced to engage when she wasn't fully invested. To please someone else at the cost of herself. And every time, it felt awful. She hated herself every time. So being on the other end of that—being the one who took without permission—wasn't an option, even if she knew Agatha was <em>different</em>.</p><p align="left">And that also made her think about last night. About what she had done to that poor woman she left lying on the bed.</p><p align="left">In her mind, everything was linked, connected. And everything made her feel bad about the kind of person she was. A war was waging in her head, blades made of words and actions instead of steel.</p><p align="left">Rio finally sat down after Agatha told her what she made for dinner, like a stubborn child finally satisfied after getting what they wanted. And it was adorable—the softness in Agatha's blue eyes, the sweet smile that blossmed on her face as she motioned for Rio to sit.</p><p align="left">She was grining when Agatha brought out the last piece of china: a pitcher of orange juice. Then she sat down, facing Rio.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at it.</p><p align="left">Well... wouldn't wine be much better? She had never liked orange juice since she was a kid. In her head, it always tasted like toothpaste even if she hadn't drink it in a long while.</p><p align="left">“Why juice and not... wine?” Rio asked as she watched Agatha pouring a glass for each of them.</p><p align="left">Agatha set the pitcher on the wooden table and looked at her for a moment.</p><p align="left">“You know why.”</p><p align="left">“No, I don't.” Rio said innocently, as if she truly didn't know.</p><p align="left">“Look, I know it's none of my business, but—”</p><p align="left">“What? I'm not an alcoholic,” Rio interrupted, taking her first bite of the perfectly cooked chicken breast. “Mmm. This is really good,” she said after letting the taste linger in her mouth for a few seconds.</p><p align="left">“Thank you,” Agatha said with a soft smile, clearly dismissing Rio's other comment.</p><p align="left">They ate in silence for a few minutes, only the soft sounds of chewing and sipping filling the space between them. But their eyes didn't follow suit—their gazes met across the table every now and then, speaking in glances and stares instead of words.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at Agatha and she wanted to say something. <em>Anything</em>.</p><p align="left">Should she mention the sketches she saw earlier? No, she wasn't even supposed to see them. What would Agatha think of her?</p><p align="left">Should she say that wine reminded her of Agatha? No, she had just said she wasn't an alcoholic. She shouldn't bring up anything alcohol-related at the moment.</p><p align="left">At the end of the inner fight, she settled on a question—one that slipped out without much thought.</p><p align="left">“Do you speak French?” </p><p align="left">“I do,” Agatha replied as she stared straight into Rio's eyes. </p><p align="left">Rio hummed, thinking of what to say next to keep the conversation going.</p><p align="left">“Okay, say something in French,” she said, locking eyes with Agatha. There was something in Agatha's gaze trying to reach out—something distant, but it was <em>present</em>. It could be seen even from a distance.</p><p align="left">Agatha licked her lips as she kept her eyes locked on Rio's. Then she spoke with a deep voice after a few seconds. “Je vois l’amour m’attendre dans tes yeux comme un nuage d’orage pris à l’horizon lointain<em>,</em>” She delivered the confession with such tenderness as if trying to make them land gently upon Rio's ears.</p><p align="left">“God, it sounds so beautiful, but... I have <em>absolutely</em> no idea what you're saying,” Rio responded before tossing a forkful of lettuce into her mouth.</p><p align="left">In a way, she felt the weight of the words, even if she couldn't grasp their meaning. She didn't know what Agatha had said, but she definitely felt the way she'd said it. And for reasons she couldn't quite explain, she didn't want to understand. <em>Hell</em>, Agatha could've been cursing her and Rio wouldn't have cared.</p><p align="left">Agatha only smiled at her—that beautiful, <em>beautiful</em> smile of hers—the one that pushed all the way up to her gleaming blue eyes.</p><p align="left">“I don't really like the language though,” Agatha said, lowering her gaze to her plate, “but I have so many fond memories because of it.”</p><p align="left">Rio watched her for a few seconds. She felt the shift in Agatha's voice and gaze and she wanted to know why.</p><p align="left">“What's living in Paris like?”</p><p align="left">Agatha lifted her gaze up, that sweet smile was still gracing her lips. She took a moment to respond—studying Rio's face as memories played out in her mind.</p><p align="left">“It was peaceful... at first. When I first got there, it was a hopeful place for me. I liked the way my feet landed there. I—I lived in many places, but nowhere really held my heart the way Paris did.” She paused just long enough to softly sigh. “But it changed. In a really harsh way. It became haunting. Hopeless. It wasn't a place for me anymore.” Agatha gently set her fork down on her plate not to cause a sound as her eyes met Rio's.</p><p align="left">She stayed silent for a few long seconds. Just staring—<em>admiring</em>.</p><p align="left">“You remind me of <em>every</em> beautiful memory I had there. I don't know why, but... I see them in your eyes, shining—and that is <em>not</em> a metaphor.”</p><p align="left">Rio's heart tightened in her chest as her eyes stayed locked on Agatha's. The way she said those words made her want to <em>cry</em>. She didn't know what it felt like to live in Paris. She didn't know what memories Agatha was referring to. But she felt those words move through her body like heat.</p><p align="left">She swallowed, trying to find a response. But nothing came.</p><p align="left">“You remind me of wine.” She couldn't hold it any longer. It was like she'd just climbed out of one hole only to fall into another. <em>Idiot</em>.</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled. “How so?”</p><p align="left">“Intoxicating,” Rio said as her gaze dropped for a second then raised again to met Agatha's.</p><p align="left">Agatha pressed her tongue against the inside of her cheek, smiling with mild amusement.</p><p align="left">“Mhm. I'll take that as a compliment.”</p><p align="left">“It is a compliment.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah.” Agatha said. “Do I make you intoxicated then?”</p><p align="left">“You do,” Rio answered as she felt heat creeping into her skin. Making her sweat.</p><p align="left">“Describe that for me. I'm not sure I get it. How does it feel? To be intoxicated by someone?”</p><p align="left">Rio stared at Agatha without even blinking.</p><p align="left">How the fuck was she supposed to describe that? Yes, she had a PhD in English, but that wasn't helping.</p><p align="left">“<em>Addictive</em>.”</p><p align="left">She said the only three syllables she could find in her head, then she reached for the glass of juice she hadn’t touched all evening. She chugged it down, and <em>God</em>, it really did taste like toothpaste. </p><p align="left">Agatha only hummed in response and Rio felt relieved at that.</p><p align="left">Now she won't complain about the silence. </p><p align="left">They finished eatin after they talked about a few things here and there, but they didn't dig that deep. Keeping the conversation light, at the surface.</p><p align="left">Later, Rio insisted on washing the dishes despite Agatha's protest. She did it anyway.</p><p align="left">She was rinsing a glass when she felt arms wrap around her waist from behind. Rio's movements froze for long seconds when Agatha pressed a soft kiss to her neck. Her breath hitched and warmth flared in her chest. She didn't move. Rio couldn't.</p><p align="left">Water kept falling onto her hands as Agatha continued pressing soft kisses along her heating skin. Agatha's hold tightened around her middle, and she pressed a kiss to Rio's shoulder blade above the fabric.</p><p align="left">“I want to show you something.” Agatha whispered near her ear.</p><p align="left">Her warm breath against Rio's skin made her close her eyes and exhale softly. <em>God</em>, she would give anything to stay in that moment, right there, without moving an inch.</p><p align="left">Rio finally resumed her task.</p><p align="left">“Leave them,” Agatha said as she rested her chin on Rio's shoulder.</p><p align="left">“I'm almost finished,” Rio said, her voice was barely above a whisper. Trying not to sound affected because of what happening.</p><p align="left">“You're stubborn,” Agatha murmured as she leaned in and pressed another kiss to Rio's skin. Her lips were soft, almost made Rio melt in her place.</p><p align="left">Rio chuckled. “I've been told."</p><p align="left">After a few more seconds, Rio got used to the embrace. She felt the warmth of intimacy wrapping her like a blanket.</p><p align="left">She wondered if Agatha had hesitated before holding her. Wondered what she'd thought about before doing so.</p><p align="left">Once she finished, she turned off the water and spun around to face Agatha.</p><p align="left">Agatha's hands settled on her hips. Holding her tightly.</p><p align="left">They were close, <em>so</em> close—that if Agatha pushed Rio even an inch, her back would hit the counter. If Agatha moved herself forward an inch, their hips would be flush against each other.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at Agatha's face. Those beautiful features—she found so much comfort in them. Agatha smiled and leaned in to press a soft kiss to the apple of her cheek. </p><hr/><p align="left">They went upstairs, heading to Agatha's studio and Rio's heart pounded in her chest—loud and rapid. </p><p align="left">They entered the white-painted space, and her heartbeat only grew louder and faster. The studio looked a bit different from what she'd seen earlier.</p><p align="left">It was tidier, the mess was more contained. Canvases and supplies were placed where Rio assumed they belonged. Some artworks were hung on the walls; others were stacked in neat lines. </p><p align="left">Rio wanted to speak. To admit that she'd already seen the place, because she was nosy. </p><p align="left">Her gaze fell on that sketchbook, and her heart pounded even harder against her ribcage.</p><p align="left">“Agatha, I—”</p><p align="left">“Don't mind the chaos,” Agatha said as she walked toward a painting that stood facing the windows, turned backward.</p><p align="left">If this was what Rio thought it was... God, she suddenly felt like the worst person alive.</p><p align="left">If Agatha turned that painting around and revealed it to Rio as a surprise—</p><p align="left">Rio thought about running. Because her curiosity had ruined it all.</p><p align="left">And there was nothing worse than ruining a surprise.</p><p align="left">Agatha approached the object in question and turned it to face Rio—and what Rio saw in front of her nearly made her pass out.</p><p align="left">There, before her eyes, stood a 24×36 painting she had never seen before. It wasn't the first one she'd seen a couple of weeks ago, nor the second she'd glanced at earlier. This one was different.</p><p align="left">It was her. <em>Rio</em>.</p><p align="left">Wearing a white satin dress that clung to her body in a way that almost made her heart ache. It hugged every curve—<em>perfectly</em>. Her navel contour was visible through the silky fabric, her nipples were slightly erect, peaking through. The dress had a high slit that revealed one tanned, bare thigh. And she was barefoot.</p><p align="left">Then Rio's eyes drifted up. Around her painted neck hung that necklace—the one she never took off unless she absolutely had to, and only left behind when she forgot. Her comfort piece. Its green sapphire gleamed on her collarbone, and the way Agatha had painted it made Rio's entire body twitch. Her cleavage was rendered in such exquisite detail, it may have even looked better than the real thing.</p><p align="left">She stepped closer.</p><p align="left">She hadn't looked at Agatha once, not since the reveal. </p><p align="left">Her movements were slow, her steps were small and light, shaken by awe.</p><p align="left">Her gaze traveled upward, tracing her own features. The shape of her face, the placement of every detail and feature... it all looked surreal. Dreamlike.</p><p align="left">Her lips were slightly parted, just enough to reveal her front teeth. Her nose was painted perfectly. And her eyes?</p><p align="left"><em>God</em>.</p><p align="left">The way Agatha had painted her eyes made Rio feel as if her painted self was staring straight into her soul. Penetrating her. Her hair flowed—it was long and dark, cascading down her back like silk. </p><p align="left">The last thing Rio looked at was the background. </p><p align="left">Earthy greens. Shades of brown. Dashes of yellow and blue swirling together. It framed her painted figure like a shrine. She looked like a goddess.</p><p align="left">Rio glanced at Agatha for a split second, not even able to register the look on her face or comprehend the smile on her lips, because Rio's gaze snapped back to the painting like a magnet. She kept looking. She couldn't stop. Unaware of time. Unaware of breathing. Just... stunned.</p><p align="left">“Hmm?”</p><p align="left">Agatha's hum broke through the silence and made Rio turn her face to the side to look at her.</p><p align="left">“Sorry, what?” Rio asked, her eyes wandering across Agatha's face. </p><p align="left">“I said, do you like it?”</p><p align="left">Rio's gaze drifted back to the painting for a few lingering seconds, then returned back to Agatha.</p><p align="left">“I—I don't know what to say, Agatha. I—” she began, her fingertips reaching out to touch the canvas. “I don't think I have words to describe this.” Her fingers stroked the surface gently, deliberately gliding up and down.</p><p align="left">“Do I like it? I love it.” Rio said, her voice a low murmur. “I just can't believe what I'm looking at. This is... it's a masterpiece. Not because it's a full-body portrait of me. It's because...” Her breath caught. “Because <em>you</em> painted it, Agatha. God. I don't know what I'm supposed to say. I've never been... this stunned in my entire life. This is—this is perfection. Not a single word I've leaned or memorized could do it justice. It's phenomenal. Astonishing. So goddamn stunning it makes my heart pound in my chest.”</p><p align="left">Rio didn't notice the few tears slipping down her cheeks. Didn't notice how Agatha was <em>watching</em> her.</p><p align="left">“Every little detail I see makes me feel <em>seen</em>. Because I am. You... You saw me. This...” Her voice faltered. “<em>God</em>. You really looked at every goddamn part of my face and body, didn't you? Because how else would you have painted that little mole on my ankle?” Rio choked out a soft chuckle in disbelief. “You saw everything. And it's... fuck me, it's so impressive because you painted this from memory. Oh my god.”</p><p align="left">She kept mumbling, her fingers were still gliding across the painted version of herself. Then, finally, she reached up to brush away the tear that was tickling her cheek.</p><p align="left">Rio turned to Agatha, the look in her eyes made a few more tears fall down.</p><p align="left">Agatha was seeing her. <em>Literally</em>.</p><p align="left">And after a beat, Agatha smiled. A gentle curl of her lips.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her and she couldn't really help herself anymore. She threw her body into Agatha's arms and held her. She held her tightly—tight enough to feel the bones beneath the layers of flesh and skin. </p><p align="left">And Agatha held her back. The embrace was so warm and safe. It was peaceful and felt like <em>home</em>.</p><p align="left">The moment Rio became aware of how tightly she was holding Agatha, she eased her grip.</p><p align="left">“This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my entire life, and I'm not exaggerating,” Rio said, her face buried in the crook of Agatha's neck and her words came out strangled.</p><p align="left">“Glad you like it.”</p><p align="left">“I love it, Agatha. I don't just <em>like</em> it—I fucking adore it.”</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled softly as one of her hands moved up to stroke Rio's hair gently.</p><p align="left">“It's yours to have.”</p><p align="left">Rio froze in her place for a few seconds. Not even breathing.</p><p align="left">She slightly pulled back, her hands were still resting around Agatha's waist and she looked at her.</p><p align="left">“Seriously?” she asked, flabbergasted.</p><p align="left">“Yes. It's your birthday gift.”</p><p align="left">“What? You gave me a birthday gift?”</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled. “I don't know how to tell you this, but... that black dress was kind of an excuse. I just wanted to see you wearing it because I couldn't get the image of you out of my mind after I saw it. So I had to buy it and send it to you.” She laughed, a soft, breathy laugh. “This is your <em>real</em> birthday gift.”</p><p align="left">Rio blinked. Then she whispered, “Thank you.”</p><p align="left">The next second, she leaned in and crashed her lips against Agatha's, hungry for the taste of her. Rio wasn't sure if Agatha actually tasted like red wine or if she was hallucinating—but fuck, it was intoxcating and delicious. </p><p align="left">They broke apart briefly, desperate for air to fill their emptied lungs. </p><p align="left">Rio's chest heavily rose and fell and then she leaned in again to press a softer kiss to Agatha's lips.</p><p align="left">A few minutes passed. They remained close. Eyes locked.</p><p align="left">“I have to tell you something.” Rio said and Agatha only looked at her, encouraging her silently with a slight nod.</p><p align="left">“I—I saw your studio earlier this morning. I invaded your space. I looked at things I wasn't supposed to look at.”</p><p align="left">“That's okay—”</p><p align="left">“I saw your sketchbook.”</p><p align="left">They both said at once.</p><p align="left">Rio noticed the way Agatha's face changed color the moment she mentioned it.</p><p align="left">“Oh god. <em>Fuck</em>.” Agatha let out an awkward chuckle.</p><p align="left">“I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have done that.”</p><p align="left">“No, Rio. It's okay, I understand. I just... feel a little embarrassed knowing you saw the way I drew you. I'm surprised you're not even mad about it.”</p><p align="left">“Mad? Why would I be mad?”</p><p align="left">“I mean...”</p><p align="left">“Because of the way you <em>drew</em> me? That goddamn precise pose? The way you drew every detail and curve of me? If I were mad about something like that I'd be an idiot. The only thing I felt while looking at them was my heart pounding in my chest, so hard I was worried I might have a heart attack.” </p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her as she licked her lips. And this time, she was the one who crashed her lips into Rio's.</p><p align="left">As if words were useless.</p><p align="left">A heated, feverish kiss consumed them as their tongues danced and tangled.</p><hr/><p align="left">They stayed in Agatha's studio.</p><p align="left">Rio wandered the place, but more freely this time, while Agatha went about tidying up the space. </p><p align="left">When Rio offered help, Agatha refused and waved her off with: “<em>I need to do it myself, otherwise I'd go feral.</em>” Then she kissed Rio on the cheek.</p><p align="left">Rio's eyes kept drifting toward the portrait of herself every few seconds. She couldn't help it. It was striking. Pulling her in like gravity.</p><p align="left">As her gaze roamed between paintings, Rio tried to quiet her heart, especially when it thudded a little harder each time she saw a painting of a woman. In their nude forms, posing intimately.</p><p align="left">She tried to ignore the twinges of jealousy. Tried to stay composed. Casual and chill.</p><p align="left">But she wasn't. Not even close.</p><p align="left">There was a 24×36 painting of a little boy hanging on the wall.</p><p align="left">At first, Rio thought he was a girl—but looking closer, she realized he was a little boy. His brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail, a few strands were falling behind his ear. He was gazing off to the side. Rio couldn't quite tell what he was looking at.</p><p align="left">She turned around to glance at Agatha who was organizing boxes, then Rio looked back to the boy in the painting.</p><p align="left">He looked like Agatha—not in the shape, but in a way Rio couldn't quite place. But that boy looked like her. </p><p align="left">She was about to move away and stare at something else when she felt Agatha standing beside her. Rio heard the deep breath Agatha exhaled before she spoke</p><p align="left">“This is Nicholas. My baby boy.” Agatha extended her hand to brush the boy's cheek with her knuckles as if he were really there. But Agatha was only wishing to stroke his soft skin. To feel him by her side.</p><p align="left">A few long seconds passed in complete silence as Agatha kept looking at the painting and Rio was staring at <u>her</u>.</p><p align="left">“He... we were on our way to a basketball game, his favorite team. He was sitting beside me, singing his favorite song when a drunk driver crashed into us on a one-way road. It happened in the blink of an eye. And my baby... he died immediately.” Agatha's eyes remained fixed on Nicky's portrait. “I try to paint him every now and then... because... God, I'm really afraid of forgetting his face. His innocent  features.”</p><p align="left">Rio heard the way Agatha sniffled, chocking back tears. So she placed a gentle hand on her shoulder.</p><p align="left">Rio felt the way her heart sank. Hearing this broke her. Agatha's grief was woven in every word she spoke—every sob she tried to swallow. And it was heartbreaking to witness. And it made it even more sorrowful was the fact that Agatha was feeling it. She <em>felt</em> it not just witnessed it.</p><p align="left">Agatha turned to the side and looke at Rio. Her eyes were glassy, her nose tinged with pink—but no tears fell. As if she was fighting to hold them back.</p><p align="left">“I'm so sorry about your loss Agatha.” Their eyes met. “I won't tell you that it's okay or that it will pass. Or that it will... get easier with time. Because it won't. You'll probably never figure out how to deal with something like that. Because once it happens, you feel lost. Like you're running through a maze with no exit in sight.”</p><p align="left">Rio took Agatha's hand and enclosed it between both of hers, her gaze dropping to their hands as she continued, “You know... when people <em>leave</em>, their seats remain empty. And nothing in the world can fill them. We shouldn't even try to fill them. They're <em>not</em> meant to be filled. They should stay that way, as remainders—as memories to the beauty of remembering who once sat there. The people we still love so dearly... but who... <em>had</em> to leave.” Rio lifted her gaze up at Agatha—who was staring down at their hands while listening to Rio.</p><p align="left">“I know it's heavy. It doesn't get lighter over time. It never does. But I guess... in a way, we just get used to the weight. We become capable of holding it on our shoulders. It becomes something... <em>familiar—</em>not necessarily easy, or good in any way. Just... <em>known</em>.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah. Guess you're right.” Was the only response Agatha offered. Her eyes stayed locked on Rio's hands wrapped around hers. </p><p align="left">After a few seconds, she looked up and met Rio's gaze. She smiled—a soft smile that didn't reach her eyes. It was wounded, Rio could recognize that kind of smile. Rio <em>knew</em> it.</p><p align="left">“I'll stay here, I've got a lot to do. Make yourself at home.”</p><p align="left">“Can I stay here? If that's okay?”</p><p align="left">“Of course.” Agatha leaned in and stole a soft kiss from Rio's lips before she lifted one of Rio's hands and kissed the back of it as their eyes met.</p><p align="left">They stayed at the studio for about an hour. They didn't talk much, just little comments here and there.</p><p align="left">But their eyes met constantly.</p><p align="left">Rio would glance at Agatha only to find her already looking. And every time, her heart clenched in her chest.</p><p align="left">She wandered around the studio, feeling as if she were in an art gallery. Each piece was beautiful in its own way—different, yet all sharing something in common. Agatha's touches.</p><p align="left">She kept returning to that portrait. The one that filled her with many emotions at once. Every time she looked at it, she noticed something new—little details, nearly invisible. But they were there. Scattered all over her figure and around it.</p><p align="left">When they finally left the studio, Rio changed back into her previous clothes from the night before—the black button-up shirt and black jeans. This time, she buttoned everything expect the top two ones. She grabbed her phone, checked it, then slipped it into her pocket with the rest of her things</p><p align="left">Agatha made tea for them both as Rio stared at her with a big smile while she sat down, then they headed to the living room. </p><hr/><p align="left">“You've got a lot of interesting films in here. Queer and witchy stuff.” Rio pointed out with a chuckle. “<em>Fascination</em> 1979? That's some heavy stuff.”</p><p align="left">“You've seen it?” Agatha asked from her spot on the couch.</p><p align="left">Rio turned around, holding the copy of the film in her hand. “Yeah, a few years ago.” She continued looking through the collection. “I like this one,” she added, holding up <em>The City of The Dead </em>1960 to show it to Agatha.</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled. “One of my favourites.” She took a sip of her green tea, then she continued, “Looks like I'm not the only one interested in witchcraft,” she said with a smirk.</p><p align="left">Rio chuckled. “I watch everything, really—so long as it interests me.”</p><p align="left">She closed the glass cabinet door, slid her hands into her pockets and walked toward Agatha.</p><p align="left">“Will you go on a date with me?” Rio asked as she stood in front of the wooden coffee table, her eyes looking at Agatha—who was already watching her with dark, gleaming eyes.</p><p align="left">It was about time, Rio thought. She wanted to go on a date with Agatha—a real one. </p><p align="left">Agatha smirked as she set her cup down, her gaze never leaving Rio's.</p><p align="left">“Yes, Rio. I'd love to.” The smirk didn't fade, it only deepened and grew more intense, making Rio's heart tighten in her chest. Whatever Agatha was thinking, Rio wanted to know.</p><p align="left">“What's that look?”</p><p align="left">“What look?”</p><p align="left">“<em>That</em> look, Agatha.”</p><p align="left">Agatha laughed. “It's nothing.”</p><p align="left">Rio narrowed her eyes. “It's wicked.”</p><p align="left">“Okay.” Agatha laughed again, softer this time. It was so sweet and sparked a heated flutter in Rio's stomach.</p><p align="left">“I'll pick the right place for us,” Agatha stood up to face Rio. “You just have to wear <em>that</em> dress for me. I want  to see it again on you.” Her hand reached out to Rio's jaw—only the small table was between them.</p><p align="left">Rio felt her heart plummet to her stomach, right alongside all the heat pooling there.</p><p align="left">“Yeah?” Agatha tilted Rio's face up by the chin and stared into her eyes. She licked her lips as her pupils dilated.</p><p align="left">Rio was certain their lips were about to crash, but Agatha's next words made her eyes widen even more.</p><p align="left">“I was planning to give you your reward. The one I promised before you fell asleep, remember? But now I can't, unfortunately. We should go on an official date first. Don't you think?”</p><p align="left">“That's not fair.” Rio pleaded.</p><p align="left">“Oh, I know.” Agatha chuckled.</p><p align="left">She walked around the table, her fingers were still hooked on Rio's chin, and then she kissed her—hot and deep. A soft moan slipped from Rio's lips.</p><p align="left">“That's all you get. For now.” Agatha announced as she brushed Rio's lips with her thumb.</p><p align="left">“You're being <em>mean</em>.” Rio whispered. Her voice was low. Her eyes keot darting between Agatha's dilated pupils and her tempting mouth.</p><p align="left">Agatha only laughed, a breathy, <em>wicked</em> sound. Then she leaned even closer. “Let's get you home,” she murmured softly while brushing her lips along Rio's earlobe. Her words burned against Rio's skin. “Though... I don't know why you insist on going home.”</p><p align="left">Rio closed her eyes. The teasing was overwhelming—but, <em>oh god</em>, how it made her shiver.</p><p align="left">The way it made her feel the blood racing through her vines. The way it made her heart pound. The heated waves that pooled down between her thighs. Agatha's warm breath. Her words against her skin. The wicked promises lying beneath. </p><p align="left">It all made her feel <em>alive</em>. </p><p align="left">“I can get a cab. I don't want to trouble you,” Rio breathlessly suggested.</p><p align="left">So Agatha clicked her tongue then she leaned in and gently bit Rio's earlobe before. “You're not troubling me, honey. And it's not about the car—it's about you <em>leaving</em> my sight.”</p><p align="left">Her words scorched Rio's skin and made her knees slightly tremble.</p><p align="left">“God... Fuck, Agatha... are you going to do something?” Rio helplessly asked—her voice was low and trembling. <em>Pleading</em>.</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled back to look at her smirking sinisterly.</p><p align="left">“Sorry about that. I'm just going to get my jacket.” She turned around and walked away. Her hips swayed with lethal precision. If it lasted any longer, Rio thought, it could've killed her.</p><p align="left">She collapsed onto the couch with a heavy sigh.</p><p align="left">When Agatha returned, wearing a black jacket and those goddamn glasses, Rio melted. She just stared at Agatha, who smirked—fully aware of the effect she had on Rio—<em>poor Rio</em>—but Rio didn't give her the satisfaction. She kept all the inappropriate comments to herself and settled on just looking <em>hungerily</em> at her. Trying so desperately to dismiss the fact that she wanted to be fed so badly.</p><hr/><p align="left">They arrived at Rio's house.</p><p align="left">It was around four in the morning. The sky was still cloaked in darkness, only the streetlights illuminating the roads.</p><p align="left">Rio unfastned her seatbelt and looked to her side. To Agatha. “Thank you,” she said sincerely as her hand reached for the door. </p><p align="left">But Agatha's soft grip on her wrist stopped her. Rio turned—and Agatha leaned in to kiss her, pouring every drop of tenderness into it. It was sweet and gentle.</p><p align="left">When they pulled back, Agatha stroked Rio's cheek with her thumb.</p><p align="left">“Take care of yourself, Rio. And <em>please</em> call me.”</p><p align="left">“I will. You take care too,” Rio replied, then she got out.</p><p align="left">She waved her goodbye and her eyes kept following Agatha's car until it disappeared into the fog.</p><p align="left">Then, from her back pocket, she pulled out the pack of cigarettes and a lighter.</p><p align="left">She lit one and smoked it to the butt as the cold morning breeze tousled her hair.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="left">Rio put her stuff on the desk. She was breathless and her face was flushed red, trying to ignore the way the students looked at her with different expressions on their faces. Aside from being fifteen minutes late, she looked like she had just ran a marathon—thanks to Agatha of course </p><p align="left">Earlier, while she was dressing for the day ahead, her phone buzzed on her bed. She hurried to check on it, and her face lit up upon seeing a message from Agatha.</p><p align="left"><em>Have a good day xx.</em></p><p align="left">Rio smiled foolishly. She just knew her day was going to be good.</p><p align="left">When she arrived at her office and was about to leave to start her class, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out and a message from Agatha was waiting for her.</p><p align="left"><em>Are you at work?</em></p><p align="left">Rio replied, and the moment she wrote “<em>Yes, I am.</em>” and sent it, Agatha followed up with a photo. A photo that made Rio weak in the knees.</p><p align="left">“Oh fuck me!” Rio muttered to herself as she dropped her stuff on the couch and sat down.</p><p align="left">Agatha's chest and pale skin were right in front of her eyes to devour. The photo was cropped so that Agatha's face and nipples were out of frame, but that didn't stop Rio from drooling over her exposed skin—over the fading hickey marks Rio had left the other day. She thought about sucking on them all over again.</p><p align="left">The way Agatha’s throat begged for attention, her damn collarbones, her wild dark hair cascading down behind her back…</p><p align="left">Rio sat there with her legs spreading widely and just <em>stared</em> at the screen for god knows how long.</p><p align="left">She definitely thought about touching herself right there in the office, but that wouldn't be very <em>professional</em>, would it? Or maybe fuck professionalism, because she had never been in a situation like this before to know what the hell to do. Maybe she should have thrown her thoughts and hesitation to the wall and just fucked herself while looking at that goddamn photo.</p><p align="left"><em>I would've told you to not touch yourself, but I know you wouldn't (;</em></p><p align="left">That was the message Rio saw in the notification bar.</p><p align="left">The heat inside her only increased and she was so goddamn helpless. She stayed like that, sitting and staring without doing anything, hoping things would calm down eventually. Spoiler: they didn't. Because her fantasies were stronger than her will.</p><p align="left">So yeah, being breathless and flushed red early in the morning had a reason. She wouldn't be panting in a classroom out of nowhere. Would she now?</p><p align="left">The two-hour lecture was kind of a hell. Torment.</p><p align="left">Her mind kept drifting back to that photo. She paused mid-speech constantly, but somehow, that didn't stop her from being the good teacher that she was and delivering the material as intended. Despite her negligence over the past five months, Rio was pretty damn good at her job. Her reputation was built on being someone who filled the gaps, honed the daggers, and remained the knowledgeable prof with the strong voice. Which were the things that made her gain her respect—and also were the things her personal life lacked.</p><p align="left">As she locked her office and was about to leave, trying to escape as fast as possible, she stopped mid-step as she remembered that she owed Alice a visit—one that she decided would be as fast as possible. So Rio turned on her heel and headed to Alice's office down the hallway.</p><p align="left">She knocked the <em>Rio's knock</em>—two fast taps with the middle phalanges of her index and middle fingers, followed by a third one. </p><p align="left">“Come on in,” came Alice's sharp voice.</p><p align="left">Rio pushed the door open. She glanced at Alice, then her eyes drifted up to look at Agatha's painting hanging above the maroon couch. It made her smile this time. Not overwhelmed.</p><p align="left">“Hey, you wanted to talk to me about something?” Rio asked as she took a seat and crossed her legs.</p><p align="left">Alice looked at her, peering over her glasses.</p><p align="left">“Last time I checked, people say <em>how are you</em> to their friends and they wait for an invention to sit down.”</p><p align="left">Rio poked the inside of her cheek with the tip of her tongue as she shoot Alice a <em>go on, lay it all</em> look.</p><p align="left">“You fucking bitch,” Alice said as she placed the papers she'd been holding on the desk.</p><p align="left">“Woah, hold on!” Rio said with half a chuckle. </p><p align="left">“Yeah? Cause I thought you were fucking dead!”</p><p align="left">“Don't be dramatic! Oh my god, I just took the day off!”</p><p align="left">“You <em>just took the day off</em>, didn't you? Seriously? Every week I think you're fucking dead Rio! You don't see anyone. You don't talk to anyone and literally <em>no one</em> knows anything about you or where you are. So excuse me for thinking that you were dead after calling you dozens of fucking times in the span of twenty-four hours until you finally picked up late at night not even knowing what the fucking time it was!” </p><p align="left">“Okay, okay. Fair enough,” Rio said with a smile, throwing her hands in the air, gladly offering her defeat. “But I told you I was asleep didn't I? And here I am, alive and breathing.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, I can see that.” </p><p align="left">“Yeah? Then how are you, Alice?”</p><p align="left">“None of your business, Vidal.”</p><p align="left">“What a hypocrite.”</p><p align="left">Alice laughed, clearly cooling off. “I'm fine. Great, even.”</p><p align="left">“Great. How's Jen?”</p><p align="left">“She's fine. But god, I haven't seen her in a week. I'm kind of on the edge of sanity.”</p><p align="left">“Where is she? Also, you're already insane, so I won't worry about that.”</p><p align="left">“She's in Greece, doing some work. Also, shut the fuck up, will you?” Alice said as she got up and sat beside Rio.</p><p align="left">“Ah, so you're suffering <em>suffering</em>?”</p><p align="left">“Yes, Rio.”</p><p align="left">“Well, you wanted to talk with me about something. What is it?”</p><p align="left">“Oh, yeah, I want the photo albums you have. Technically, all of them.” Alice continued speaking as Rio shot her a death stare. “I won't ruin them I promise! I just want to do something and I'll return them.”</p><p align="left">“Alright, but I swear if you—”</p><p align="left">“I won't!” </p><p align="left">“Good. That's all?”</p><p align="left">“No... I, uh, I saw Jane here yesterday.”</p><p align="left">Rio's expressions changed immediately upon hearing that name. Because holy fucking shit.</p><p align="left">“What? That fucking bitch...”</p><p align="left">“Yeah. And the Irony of it all, she literally asked me if I knew where you were.”</p><p align="left">“What did you tell her?”</p><p align="left">“Well, I obviously pretended she doesn't exist. Like hello?” </p><p align="left">Rio went silent for a few minutes. Jane had always been creepy, but she’d never dared come to Rio's work or ask her friends anything. Clearly Rio had underestimated her. Once a creep, always a creep.</p><p align="left">“Has she been approaching you?” Alice asked as she watched Rio zoning out.</p><p align="left">“No,” Rio dismissed immediately. And Alice didn't push any further. Either she sounded too convincing or too dismissive, one of them did the job.</p><p align="left">They drove to Rio's house separately, as Rio's head was bouncing from one thing to another during the ride—but the main event was Agatha's photo. She couldn't get it out of her head, and every time it crossed her mind, a renewed heat would pool between her legs and settle in her stomach. As much as it felt unpleasant and she wanted to hurry up and get rid of it, it also gave her a strange sense of being alive in a way. Of being present in the moment. Of being able to feel something <em>oh</em> so delicious.</p><p align="left">Because she couldn't even recall when was the last time a goddamn photo made her feel that way. When was the last time she got that much pleasure from burning from the inside, and down between her thighs.</p><p align="left">Once they arrived, Rio opened the door and stepped inside with Alice following behind—who's phone was glued to her ear and a bright smile was lighting up her face.</p><p align="left">“I'm with Rio now, I'll call you later,” Alice said as Rio handed her a cold beer from the fridge.</p><p align="left">“I love you too, babe. Take care.”</p><p align="left">Rio smiled at her as she took the first sip from the bottle, eyes gleaming with a shit-eating grin.</p><p align="left">“What?” Alice asked, tossing her phone into her pocket. The smile stayed on her face, pushing her cheeks all the way up.</p><p align="left">“I gotta go see my dentist, ‘cause you guys are sickly sweet.”</p><p align="left">“That sounded cheesy as fuck, Rio.” Alice said with a chuckle.</p><p align="left">Rio only grinned as she took another sip. There were only a few things that truly made her happy—seeing Alice like that was definitely one of them.</p><p align="left">“Anyway, have you changed anything here? It looks different.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, I took the Christmas tree to the basement.”</p><p align="left">“You haven't had a Christmas tree in three years.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? Guess nothing changed then.”</p><p align="left">“Asshole.”</p><p align="left">Rio went to the living room to grab the few photo albums she kept there. Then she headed to her bedroom, where a few smaller ones sat in a box alongside some stuff from her high school and early college years—such as a little ceramic dragonfly, a worn-out journal, a golden cup that -<strong>She gives A head!</strong>- written under it (a silly birthday gift from Alice that Rio loved way too much), and a lyric notebook plastered with punk bands stickers on its cover and scribbled <strong>THE SCISSORS</strong> in bold letters across the front.</p><p align="left">Then she headed down to the basement, where Alice was digging like it was a thrift shop.</p><p align="left">“You still keep all those energy drink cans?”</p><p align="left">“I'm a collector, Alice.” Rio said with a laugh, like she didn't believe it herself.</p><p align="left">“Why do you even keep the albums down here ?”</p><p align="left">“Nostalgia is a beast, darling,”</p><p align="left">“Guess I should keep them with me then.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? What would you do with my parents' photos?” Rio said with a chuckle, but the look on Alice’s face was one of someone who caught off guard and left speechless. So Alice kept looking through the boxes until she found the ones she'd been looking for.</p><p align="left">One of the albums was black, its cover decorated with polaroid photos of their old band members—their shirts were lifted up and their tongues stuck out of their mouths, on their chests were glued handmade stickers which were badly drawn boobs and their signatures were scrawled beneath each one.</p><p align="left">Alice let out a weird sound that should’ve been a laugh and it made Rio laugh in response.</p><p align="left">“God, we were fucking wild!” Alice let out a chuckle, as the look in her eyes screamed nostalgia.</p><p align="left">“Don't you miss these two?” She asked, referring to Ella and Chris. </p><p align="left">“Not really.” Rio said as she set her beer down and leaned closer to take a better look. </p><p align="left">“I mean high school them, not when they turned out to be bitches,” Alice clarified.</p><p align="left">“Yeah… well, kinda. I don't really think about them.”</p><p align="left">“Me neither. Anyway, I can't wait to show these to Jen.”</p><p align="left">“Put a shirt on me first.”</p><p align="left">“You should’ve put it on yourself, perv.”</p><p align="left">They looked through more photos and talked for a few more minutes, mostly Rio throwing in rotten mom jokes or dirty one-liners whenever she had the chance. Typical Rio behavior.</p><p align="left">Alice told her to stop disappearing. Told her to call or text because it won't kill her. Then they hugged goodbye.</p><p align="left">Maybe Alice didn't know it because Rio didn't show it that much—but her presence always brought joy to Rio. The way their relationship only seemed to bond, no matter how much distance got between them. No matter how distant <em>Rio</em> got. Because Alice was truly the only person Rio ever called a friend. For almost three decades, they’d understood each other. Been there during all the highs and the lows. Protecting each other’s backs.</p><p align="left">So maybe Rio didn't express it much, but she was thankful for Alice. For being in her life and for staying in it despite everything.</p><hr/><p align="left">Rio threw herself on the couch and lay there as the second bottle of beer found its way into her hand. She took her phone out, and the second she unlocked it, she was met with Agatha’s photo.</p><p align="left">“<em>God, Agatha…</em>” She whispered in a low, breathy murmur. She set the bottle down and in the next second her thumb and index fingers zoomed in. She took the photo with her eyes. Quite literally. </p><p align="left">Rio licked her lips, once then twice, before swallowing hard when she scrolled down to see the message Agatha had sent earlier.</p><p align="left"><em>I would've told you to not touch yourself, but I know you wouldn't (; </em></p><p align="left">Rio knew Agatha could be really <em>daring</em> in such contexts, that much was obvious, and it thrilled Rio. But for some reason, she didn't think she'd go there—there in the sense of asking if she was at work so she could send a photo of herself and make sure that Rio <em>couldn't</em> do a thing with that goddamn winky face because Agatha <em>knew</em> exactly what she was doing and how much effect she had on Rio.</p><p align="left">Rio’s hand drifted down to the button of her pants. She opened it and pulled the zipper down. The first moan that escaped her lips was one of awe, a reaction to how fucking <em>soaked</em> she was.</p><p align="left">She started touching herself while staring at that photo with hunger in her eyes. She shut her eyes, and her mind began to drift to kissing that throat. To kissing and sucking that pale, captivating skin. To leave her marks all over it again. To feel Agatha’s fingers instead of her own…</p><p align="left">She threw the phone to the side to lie beside her on the couch as she felt her orgasm building, ready to tear through her and flood her body with pleasure. </p><p align="left">Just as she was on the verge of receiving the reward she <em>so</em> desperately wanted and deserved, her phone buzzed beside her, making her snap her eyes open immediately. Irritated. Her hand stilled but remained in place. She cursed under her breath, grabbed her phone and looked at the name on the screen.</p><p align="left">Her mouth went dry.</p><p align="left">Agatha. And it wasn't just a call, Agatha was video calling.</p><p align="left">Rio sat up immediately. She blinked at the screen, then hurried to her feet. She drank some water in an attempt to steady her breathing and calm herself down. After a moment, she sat back down, took off her blazer, closed the first two buttons of her shirt, then unbuttoned them again with a bonus one. She tucked a few strands of hair behind her ear. When she grabbed her phone and was about to swipe to answer, it fell silent between her hands. The screen was filled once more with Agatha’s photo.</p><p align="left">“Goddamn it,” She muttered.</p><p align="left">She considered calling back, and the moment the thought gained momentum, Agatha’s message came through:</p><p align="left"><em>Sorry about that.</em></p><p align="left">Then another one.</p><p align="left"><em>Would you believe me if I told you my phone fell down and decided to call you on its own? </em></p><p align="left">Rio laughed, because yeah, that was believable. It happened to her once when she was mid-watching <em>Angels in America</em> in the bath, and her phone fell down and called the group chat she was in. Alice had answered in the same exact second. Thank god it was Alice and not someone else.</p><p align="left"><em>Yes, I'd believe it. But was that the only reason?</em></p><p align="left">Rio waited a few minutes for Agatha’s response while finishing the last of her beer. But Agatha didn't reply. So, Rio just got up, changed her clothes, and crashed into bed—resuming what had been interrupted.</p><hr/><p align="left">“<em>This piece was inspired by my own journey of excavation. My own grave digging to see if the mothers were truly dead.</em>” Agatha responded to the reporter’s question. “<em>... I can say that it's layered, and... it needs its own excavation.</em>” She said with a soft, honest smile before she answered another question and the video ended.</p><p align="left"><em>Excavation of the Dying Mothers (2005).</em></p><p align="left">The painting Agatha was talking about.</p><p align="left">Four female figures sat around a wide table. They shared the same clothes and hair—but their faces lacked features. They seemed like they were arguing or discussing something. The way each one held a cross in her hand and pointed it at the other suggested they weren’t having a <em>casual</em> conversation.</p><p align="left">The dominant colors were dark browns and blacks, with deep, shadowy hues filling most of the canvas. Muted greens and grays were visible in the depiction of the figures' bodies and the table they sat at. Pale yellows and whites were used for the faint, eerie light that emanated from shattered candles—illuminating the old women's blurry faces—making them look even more haunting. The Chiaroscuro effect heightened the focus on the faceless figures. Making them the clear focal point of the scene.</p><p align="left">The painting was… allusive. Evocative. <em>Haunting</em>.</p><p align="left">Rio found the four-minute-long YouTube video as she struggled to fall asleep. Agatha was sitting, and that painting hung on a dark wall behind her.</p><p align="left">The video looked much older than 11 years ago—the publishing date. It looked older, like the mid-2000s or so.</p><p align="left">Lying on her side, phone almost glued to her eyes, Rio watched that video five times or maybe more. Who was really counting? </p><p align="left">Every time the screen faded to darkness, she would go back to the beginning and rewatch it all over again. She paused several times to look at Agatha. To just… stare at her features and listen to her voice. And each time Rio gazed at her, something stirred inside her.</p><p align="left">Why hadn’t Agatha responded yet? It had been seven hours, and Rio’s mind was beginning to drift.</p><p align="left">So, with sleep eluding her and Agatha not responding, Rio got to her feet and headed downstairs. She grabbed the bottle of vodka and shuffled her <em>I'll break my spine: the playlist </em>playlist.</p><p align="left"><em>I Want Your (Hands on Me)</em> by Sinéad O'Connor started playing, making Rio tap her foot to the first beat and sway her body immediately. </p><p align="left">By the time <em>I Think I'm Paranoid </em>by Garbage came on, a cigarette found its way between her lips. Each puff of smoke was followed by a gulp of alcohol.</p><p align="left">She kept dancing and drinking as the music kept playing in the background. Mixed rhythms, mixed lyrics.</p><p align="left"><em>Inertia Creeps</em> by Massive Attack, <em>Kool Thing</em> by Sonic Youth, <em>Hall of Ice </em>by Lebanon Hanover, <em>We Hunger </em>by Siouxsie and the Banshees, <em>Dancing With Myself </em>by Billy Idol and other songs she knew by heart. The vodka bottle lost more than half of its content, and the third cigarette rested unlit between her lips.</p><p align="left">And that was how Rio's night went. It ended with her sleeping on the couch in the dimly lit space as the music faded from her ears. </p><p><em>Electric blue eyes</em><br/><em>Where did you come from?</em></p><p><em>Electric blue eyes</em><br/><em>Who sent you?</em></p><p><em>Electric blue eyes</em><br/><em>Always be near me</em></p><p><em>Electric blue eyes</em><br/><em>I need you</em></p><p align="left">She crashed out, completely wasted.</p><p align="left">When Rio woke up, she felt out of place. Unaware of anything except the headache that was about to explode her head off. She spent half an hour sitting on the couch, trying to make sense of whatever the fuck had happened hours ago. She looked around the space. Two bottles of vodka lay on the floor—one of them drained and dead, and the other was standing still. Her t-shirt was discarded on the floor—when did that happen?</p><p align="left">She scanned the room with her burning eyes, as the hammering in her head became even more relentless.</p><p align="left">She lifted her gaze to the side and found her phone lying on the edge of the coffee table. It was 3 pm, thank god it was Saturday.</p><p align="left">A message from Alice and two from Agatha.</p><p align="left">Her heart beat harder and quicker. She closed her eyes briefly and tried to make sense of the situation. </p><p align="left">She had a date with Agatha today. A real fucking date with the woman who had been living in her head. They had discussed it on the drive home and agreed on Saturday night.</p><p align="left">She was the one who brought it up and asked, yet, she felt an anxious rush flood through her, making her overwhelmed.</p><p align="left">A date. <em>Huh</em>.</p><p align="left">The last date she'd decided on go on had mentally and emotionally imprisoned her for four fucking years. It had abused her in different ways, and it crippled her.</p><p align="left">Yeah, it was sweet at first, for about nine months, but things started getting haunting and weird afterward. She couldn't blame the date itself though. She was the one to blame. She was the one who chose to go on a date with a fucking psychopath. Maybe she didn't know at first, but she stayed for years even after she knew.</p><p align="left">Five months ago, she broke up with Jane. And now, here she was.</p><p align="left">So going on a date was a big deal. A really big deal.</p><p align="left">Maybe things would go wrong, what would happen next?</p><p align="left">If there was something Rio didn't want to fuck up, with all the honesty and the sincerity in the world, it was this. The thing she had with Agatha. The undefined relationship. The strange connection. She didn't want to fuck this up.</p><p align="left">Rio stared at the screen for so long without even unlocking it. </p><p align="left">She read Alice’s message:</p><p align="left"><em>Do you plan on isolating yourself today or do you want to go out?</em></p><p align="left"><em>isolating myself is always the right option, Alice, dear. But i actually have plans today, so maybe tomorrow?</em></p><p align="left">Then her heart pounded in her chest as she clicked on Agatha’s chat.</p><p align="left"><em>Hey, sorry, something urgent came up and I was busy. But to answer your question, no, it wasn't the only reason, I wanted to call you. </em></p><p align="left">Agatha had sent this message hours ago when Rio was busy drinking and fighting her demons.</p><p align="left"><em>Good morning. You're still up for tonight, yeah? I'll pick you up at 7:30, if that's okay with you.</em></p><p align="left">Rio stared at the screen, a soft smile finding its way to her lips. But the way her heart was still pounding made her anxious, why was it beating so loudly over a text?</p><p align="left">She typed Good morning three times in a row and it made her frustrated, until she finally managed writing the Good afternoon</p><p align="left"><em>Good afternoon. Yeah that's okay with me. Looking forward for tonight.</em></p><hr/><p align="left">With the few hours she had, Rio managed to tidy up the place, eat something to silence her empty stomach, take a shower, and stare into nothingness.</p><p align="left">Her anticipation toward the night made her feel a whirlwind of emotions swirling through her body. But the overwhelming sensation was taking the lead.</p><p align="left">By the time it was nearing 6 pm, she left her phone on the night stand and rose to her feet. </p><p align="left">She took the black dress out and just looked at it. Felt it with her hands.</p><p align="left">When Agatha disappeared the past week, Rio tried to avoid looking at the piece of fabric every time, until she tucked it in the back of the closet so she wouldn't have to look at it again. </p><p align="left">She finished dressing. <em>The</em> black dress, black heels, her necklace, earnings, and a few rings on. Agatha’s ring went on her thumb so she could return it later.</p><p align="left">She applied red lipstick on and went with a smokey eye makeup look. </p><p align="left">She turned around to look at herself in the full-length mirror and something was so goddamn striking about the way she looked. Rio knew she was a good-looking woman, but <em>god</em>, the way this dress made her feel about herself? It was indescribable. She felt sexy in her own skin. She felt hot. She felt like she could have absolutely anything she wanted. The way it hugged her body so perfectly? That was insane.</p><p align="left">She moved her hand over her body, feeling the curves above the fabric.</p><p align="left">It wasn't about the dress. She knew it was about <em>who</em> gave it to her. <em>Who</em> told her to wear it tonight.</p><p align="left">When Agatha had told her “<em>You just have to wear that dress for me. I want to see it again on you.</em>” it wasn't a suggestion or a question—it was something that <em>must</em> be done. And it will be done—because how could she possibly disobey that? Not when it thrilled her <em>that</em> much.</p><p align="left">Rio melted at the thought that Agatha would certainly look at her. Agatha would stare at her with those gorgeous blue eyes. Agatha would possibly compliment the way she looked. And <em>fuck</em>, Rio felt herself getting aroused just from the thought of being looked at, of being praised. </p><p align="left">As she waited downstairs, a knock on the door made her look up. She stood, slipped on her long, black coat and opened the door.</p><p align="left">The sight of Agatha was something Rio knew she wouldn't be able to handle, but it seemed like she had underestimated the situation and should have prepared herself better.</p><p align="left">Agatha was standing there, a smirk on her lips as she looked Rio up and down. Her dark hair cascaded down her back. She wore a brown suit with nothing underneath it. The faint hickeys that took the shade of a soft yellow on her cleavage weren't visible, but Rio could spot them, because she <em>knew</em> they were there, and that made her mouth water. Agatha’s piercing blue eyes were locked on her, looking at Rio in a way that made her shiver.</p><p align="left">“Hey,” Rio finally found her voice. </p><p align="left">“Hey, gorgeous,” Agatha greeted—and <em>that</em> smirk, <em>that</em> look, were doing things to Rio. They were weakening her.</p><p align="left">But she smiled gently in response.</p><p align="left">“Shall we?” Agatha offered her palm for Rio to hold, and Rio obliged immediately with gleaming eyes.</p><p align="left">As she felt Agatha’s warm palm in hers and stepped closer to her, Rio inhaled Agatha’s addictive scent. She hadn’t realized before how much she missed it. How much her body craved it. </p><p align="left">“You look so beautiful,” Agatha complimented near Rio’s ear as her other hand found Rio’s waist beneath her coat.</p><p align="left">“So do you,” Rio whispered, her voice was barely audible, but it landed just right. </p><p align="left">As they walked toward Agatha’s car, Agatha opened the door for Rio. Rio noticed the slight limp Agatha’s step, it wasn't noticeable at all, but it made her worry nonetheless.</p><p align="left">Agatha got into the car and fastened her seatbelt. Her blazer exposed her skin a little more and Rio found herself staring. When she lifted her gaze, Agatha was already looking at her with a smile. Signaling that RiRio had been caught <em>staring</em>.</p><p align="left">The ride was sweet. All the overwhelming anxiety Rio had felt before melted away in Agatha’s presence, replaced by peacefulness, and heat— because that was what Rio felt most of the time, and every time she glanced at Agatha beside her. Or when she felt the way Agatha’s hand twitched, hesitant as she tried not to place her hand on Rio’s thigh. Because Agatha was determined to make this feel like a first date.</p><p align="left">Agatha got out after parking the car and opened the door for Rio. Her hand rested on Rio’s waist, and the touch warmed her in the cold night’s breeze.</p><p align="left">As they walked and entered the restaurant, Rio noticed that slight limp again. So she leaned closer, whispering in Agatha’s ear, “Are you okay?” Agatha turned her face slightly to look at her. “I am, don't worry.” She reassured with a soft smile. </p><p align="left">Rio didn't push further, even though she wanted to.</p><p align="left">When they were about to sit down and Rio took her coat off, she saw the look Agatha gave her, because... How could she not?</p><p align="left">The way she bit her bottom lip, looked at Rio’s body up and down. It was a look of appreciation but it was more like a look of thirst and craving.</p><p align="left">They sat down facing each other, and when Agatha unbuttoned her blazer as she sat down? Rio felt every bit of her self-respect drain away. Because, <em>jesus fucking christ.</em></p><p align="left">She just looked, she didn't even have the desire to eat anymore, not when what she was yearning for was literally sitting right in front of her. Not when Agatha looked <em>that</em> delicious. </p><p align="left">“You're so fucking beautiful,” The words were on the tip of Rio’s tongue when the waiter came in with a fancy bottle of wine. He filled their glasses and Agatha told him to leave the bottle.</p><p align="left">Oh yes, wine will be really useful.</p><p align="left">They looked at each other as both of them took the first sip of the night. Their eyes locked when they put their glasses down. </p><p align="left">“You look beautiful, really fucking beautiful.” Rio said, finally letting the words out. </p><p align="left">“Thank you,” Agatha replied, taking a sip of wine, her smirk was visible from behind the glass.</p><p align="left">“You really had to wear that suit, didn't you?” Rio said as she licked her lips, her eyes were roaming over Agatha’s skin, then lingering for a few long seconds on her lips and how they curved into a smile, then back to her gleaming, dark eyes.</p><p align="left">She took her glass and gulped the wine down, then again.</p><p align="left">“I gotta tell you, I can't wait to see it off.” Her voice was low, barely audible—but of course, Agatha heard her. It was loud between them.</p><p align="left">“It won't be off tonight. I don't sleep with someone on the first date,” Agatha leaned back in her chair, staring at Rio.</p><p align="left">Rio met her gaze with the same daring look, because she knew this blazer would be off within a few hours.</p><p align="left">“I'm not <em>someone</em>, Agatha... or am I?” Rio asked, and Agatha’s expression shifted for a moment, but that smirk was back, masking it.</p><p align="left">“No. You're not someone, Rio.” Agatha said, and the instant those words left her mouth, Rio felt the heel of Agatha’s shoe graze the exposed skin of her leg under the table. </p><p align="left">Rio cursed inwardly, because she was so turned on, and she was so goddamn stupid for not wearing an underwear. </p><p align="left">Agatha’s heel slowly went higher, reaching that slit on her thigh, then went back down again. The way Agatha looked at her didn't help at all. She was daring Rio to go on with her eyes and movements.</p><p align="left">Rio’s response was to bring her thighs together as tightly as possible as she finished the wine in her glass. </p><p align="left">And Agatha’s smirk only grew wider.</p><p align="left">But she put her foot down the moment she realized Rio was holding her breath, and that always seemed to trigger something inside her.</p><p align="left">“Breathe, Rio.” She said, her voice was almost a plea, before she rested her hand on Rio's in a silent reassurance.</p><p align="left">And Rio did, she exhaled the carbon dioxide that had been held captive inside her.</p><p align="left">By the time their food arrived, Rio was already three glasses in, which made her head buzz a little. </p><p align="left">“Is there a story behind your necklace? It's really enticing.”</p><p align="left">Rio took the piece in question between her fingers, looking at it, then her gaze drifted back at Agatha.</p><p align="left">“It was my mother’s. I...” Rio swallowed down the strange sensation. “I took it from her corpse.” She looked down at the plate in front of her, then back at Agatha. </p><p align="left">She hadn’t meant for it to sound strange, but it kind of did.</p><p align="left">Because it was.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s movements stilled as she looked up at Rio.</p><p align="left">“Rio, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to…”</p><p align="left">“No, no, it's totally okay, don't worry.” a sip. “I can finally talk about them. So don't worry about it.”</p><p align="left">“Are you sure?”</p><p align="left">“Totally.” She paused. “But it will ruin the vibes, especially the appetite. Not first-date material.” She chuckled, but apparently Agatha didn't seem to find it that funny. </p><p align="left">Rio looked at Agatha, her gut was telling her to go on with it, to just talk about it. But something inside her warned to back off, knowing death and grief were sensitive topics for Agatha.</p><p align="left">“They were killed,” She said, testing the waters with those three words. When she saw Agatha putting her fork down and turn her full attention to her, Rio took it as her cue to continue.</p><p align="left">She paused for a long moment, the haunting memory from twenty-seven years ago was playing vividly in her mind.</p><p align="left">“I was thirteen. We were camping in a kind of isolated spot. It was just a family thing we’d done for a few years.” As Rio spoke hesitantly, their eyes stayed locked and she found warmth in Agatha's gaze. “I was mad at them because... God, because they forgot to bring the kind of marshmallows I really wanted—a kid you know.” She kept checking if Agatha was still willing to listen, knowing the reactions she could get from a story like this.</p><p align="left">“Go on, Rio, I won't tell you to stop unless you want to.” Agatha said as her hand rested on Rio’s for the second time.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her and continued. “So, I was upset, lying inside the tent. When a man came up and talked to my parents. I didn't really hear what he said, but apparently they thought he was lost or something.”</p><p align="left">Rio refilled her glass, her hand was shaking slightly as she put the bottle down. “I peeked through the tent ten minutes later to see what was going on, and… he just… killed them with a... Butcher knife. My father first, then my mom. He was... A fucking psychopath.” She paused. Remembering. “He was turned around, looking at something—I don't quite remember what it was. So... at that moment... I—I felt like I got my chance... I didn't know what I was doing... I was panicking. So, I crawled my way out, and grabbed my father’s shotgun. Then, I don't really know how I did it, but I... Just... I just did.”</p><p align="left">Rio finished talking quickly, the panic was already rising within her. There was much more to the story, but she just wanted to be done with it.</p><p align="left">Agatha was looking at her, and there were tears in her eyes?</p><p align="left">“Ruined the night, didn't I?” She paused for a second. “There goes the murderer... quite literally if you think about it.” Rio said with an awkward chuckle. She never knew when to shut up.</p><p align="left">“I'm sorry.”</p><p align="left">“It's okay. And no, I'm the one who should be sorry, really.” Rio said as she looked down at her plate.</p><p align="left">“What are you talking about... No, Rio. God, look at me.” Agatha said as she gently squeezed Rio's hand.</p><p align="left">“No seriously, it's okay. Can we not talk about it though?”</p><p align="left">Silence enveloped them. It was heavy and raw and uncomfortable.</p><p align="left">Agatha nodded after a few seconds she just kept her eyes locked on Rio. At lost of words.</p><p align="left">And Rio smiled softly—desperately trying to ease the pressure and awkwardness she brought to the table with that smile.</p><p align="left">They tried to finish eating, but obviously they couldn't. They tried filling the space with small talks about different things here and there.</p><p align="left">Rio noticed how Agatha would change the subject immediately if the conversation veered into harsh or intense topics. And noticed the way she touched her hand gently, or looked at her with <em>that</em> soft look of hers.</p><p align="left">Rio leaned back on the chair, her cheeks were slightly pink and her eyes were locked on Agatha’s. The tip of her tongue poked the inside of her cheek as she smirked.</p><p align="left">“What's <em>that</em> look?” Rio asked. Feeling smug for no reason.</p><p align="left">“What is it?” Agatha asked in response.</p><p align="left">“I don't know. It looks really beautiful on you.”</p><p align="left">“It's because I'm looking at you.”</p><p align="left">Rio knew it wasn't the wine. She'd been turned on since she saw that photo yesterday, and nothing seemed to help her. Nothing could turn off the goddamn fire that only seemed to burn hotter with every passing second. And the fact that Agatha was in front of her didn't help at all. She looked really good, it hurt. It struck Rio’s heart and made it pound rapidly against her chest.</p><p align="left">She looked down at Agatha’s lips and she so desperately wanted them on hers. She wanted to feel Agatha close to her. She wanted Agatha. She didn't care if this was a first date and she was supposed to act like it was, she just wanted the woman. </p><p align="left">She was so aroused, so full of lust that the slightest brush of Agatha’s shoe against her skin made her body twitch.</p><p align="left">“Be right back,” Agatha said with a smile as she got up from her chair. She walked closer to Rio and pressed a soft kiss to her cheek.</p><p align="left">And that soft gesture only made Rio’s stomach clench. She wouldn't be exaggerating if she said she had never been this aroused in her entire life, and it was driving her insane.</p><p align="left">She watched Agatha walk toward the restroom. And Rio definitely noticed the way she tried to walk normally—but her mind was too fuzzy to acknowledge it—especially after Agatha had told her not to worry about it earlier.</p><p align="left">After only two minutes, Rio rose to her feet and followed Agatha. </p><p align="left">Agatha was washing her hands when Rio stood behind her. She smiled as she looked at Rio's reflection. </p><p align="left">“Missed me already?” Agatha said with a smirk as she turned around to face Rio.</p><p align="left">“<em>So much,</em>” Rio replied with a low tone that was laced with desperation and yearning. She leaned in and grabbed Agatha's wrist before she shoved her into the nearest wall. Rio didn't care about the woman who looked at them as she exited. She didn't care about where they were. Rio just leanein and crashed her lips into Agatha’s with need and lust.</p><p align="left">She started the kiss but she so desperately wanted Agatha to take the lead of it. Rio wanted Agatha to shove her tongue down her throat. She wanted to feel Agatha <em>taking</em> her.</p><p align="left">And Agatha did. She kissed her back with urgency and heat. Once Rio surrendered and melted in Agatha’s hold—Agatha took the lead and kissed Rio like she wanted. Like she <em>deserved</em>.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s hands found Rio’s hips and Rio pressed her body closer. <em>Closer</em> to Agatha’s, yearning the feeling of Agatha on her so badly, it physically hurt.</p><p align="left">They slightly pulled back to breathe. Their faces were just two inches apart as their dark eyes locked. </p><p align="left">Rio leaned in again. “<em>Please, just fuck me.</em>” She whispered the plea near Agatha’s neck. Her breaths were hot against Agatha's heating skin.</p><p align="left">“Rio…”</p><p align="left">“<em>Please, Agatha. Please just fuck me. I need you,</em>” she begged, desperately trying to hold onto Agatha.</p><p align="left">Rio rested her hands on Agatha’s hips. Her mouth was pressing ghosts of kisses on her face, down to her neck and cleavage, filling her senses with Agatha’s scent all the way down. Inhaling her deeply. She wanted to breathe Agatha.</p><p align="left">“I will, <em>I will</em>. Let's get home.”</p><p align="left">Rio slightly lifted her head up. “<em>No. Want you to fuck me right now... you—you can ruin me later.</em>” she looked directly into Agatha’s piercing blue eyes and she noticed the shift in them. “<em>I need you. So please, just give me what I want.</em>”</p><p align="left">Rio took one of Agatha’s hands and moved it lower to the exposed skin of her thigh. </p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her, making sure of it. The way Rio was looking at her. Pleading and begging to be fucked by Agatha, it was too much, and Agatha knew she couldn't refuse it. She couldn't deny Rio—not when she was at <em>such</em> a desperate state.</p><p align="left">They were in a public place. Anyone could walk in and see them. So Agatha had to be quick. She had to make Rio feel good physically, even though she knew Rio was hurting because of the conversation earlier. She knew it triggered her trauma and Rio was desperately trying to feel something through her. Because Agatha knew it. </p><p align="left">But she couldn't deny Rio—not when she begged like that. Not when she was turned on like that Agatha wanted to give her whatever she desired.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s hand went inside the slit of Rio’s dress and when her fingers met Rio’s bare cunt “<em>Oh, god, Rio…</em>” she moaned softly into Rio’s open mouth. Agatha felt the warm silk with her fingers, Rio was <em>drenched</em>. </p><p align="left">Rio felt herself on the verge of sanity at finally having those perfect fingers where she was craving them to be.</p><p align="left">Agatha's fingers separated the lips and Rio lifted her leg up to give Agatha better access—but Agatha put it down the next second, then she turned Rio’s body around to pin her against the wall, supporting her body in case it gave out. She took Rio’s leg, putting it around her waist and secured it by keeping a strong hold on Rio’s thigh.</p><p align="left">Her fingers found the throbbing clit and Agatha started rubbing it quickly—trying to give Rio the orgasm she needed, but also needing to be quick. She would make it up for her later.</p><p align="left">Agatha kept rubbing on that pace and Rio moaned loudly—it was so loud for where they were—so Agatha leaned in and took Rio’s mouth in hers to make sure she kept quiet. To swallow her moans and whimpers even if she needed to hear them. </p><p align="left">Two of Agatha’s fingers entered Rio with ease because of how wet she was, and she thrusted, pumping in and out. The sounds were obscene and filled their ears.</p><p align="left">Rio was panting, heavily breathing through her nose. When their mouths separated, Rio tried really hard to not moan at feeling Agatha inside her. She wanted suppress every sound—so she pulled her head back and buried her face on Agatha’s shoulder instead. Heavily breathing on her clothes.</p><p align="left">She was certain the sound of Agatha’s fingers pumping in and out of her drenched cunt were audible to anyone behind the door. </p><p align="left">Two more thrusts, and Rio came—her orgasm tearing through her. Her mouth was hanging open, trying not to bite on Agatha's shoulder as pleasure filled her whole. Rio's entire body trembled in Agatha’s hold. Weakened, unable to hold her weight at the intensity.</p><p align="left">Agatha kissed the side of Rio's head as she gradually slowed her pace, then she withdrawn her fingers after kissing Rio’s temple. Agatha kept her hold on Rio’s thigh for a few more seconds until she felt that Rio’s body was stabilized and able to hold her weight again.</p><p align="left">She leaned in and kissed Rio’s lips tenderly.</p><p align="left">Then she took hold of Rio’s hand after adjusting her dress and led them out.</p><p align="left">Rio’s cum coldened on her fingers—she wouldn't have wasted it like that if she wasn't in a goddamn hurry. </p><p align="left">Agatha hurried to pay the check, grab her phone and Rio’s jacket. Then they stepped out, the vold night’s breeze embraced their searing bodies. The air was thick with intensity.</p>

<p align="left">They got into Agatha’s car, both of them fastened their seatbelts and not a single word was shared between them. Only their heavy breaths—that didn't seem like they would calm down soon—filled the stretching loud silence.</p><p align="left">But their eyes spoke volumes.</p><p align="left">Agatha turned her face to the side to look at Rio—who was already looking at her with hooded, shining eyes. Her cheeks were slightly pink and her chest was still rising and falling.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s gaze was hungry, waiting to devour. It was filled with lust but also a great amount of concern that concerned Rio in return once she locked eyes with Agatha.</p><p align="left">Rio’s gaze was thirsty, and nothing could possibly quench her except Agatha.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in. She cupped Rio’s face and crashed their lips in a kiss filled with affection and warmth. Pouring their needs into each other’s mouths and finding the fulfillment in the tips of each other’s tongue. </p><p align="left">Rio’s heart was pounding rapidly in her chest as their kiss became charged and intense.</p><p align="left">When Rio’s hand traveled up to rest on Agatha’s chest and to sense her heartbeat, Rio felt her own heart stop when she was met with warm skin instead of fabric. She froze completely for a few moments until she melted back.</p><p align="left">The feeling of Agatha’s skin against her touch sparked something in Rio’s stomach, and the way Agatha heartbeats were fast and unsteady made Rio moan softly, for which Agatha hummed in response.</p><p align="left">Their mouths parted and their foreheads leaned against each other as their heavy breaths mingled and shared the unsteadiness.</p><p align="left">Rio took hold of Agatha’s hand and rested it on her chest, making Agatha feel her heartbeat. To feel what she was doing to Rio’s weak heart.</p><p align="left">Rio closed her eyes as she felt her heartbeat racing, and felt Agatha’s too, which, in a way, were sharing the same insane, threatening speed.</p><p align="left">“I need you Agatha. In every way, I need you.” Rio said as she pushed Agatha’s palm closer to her chest, adding more pressure, as if she wanted Agatha to penetrate her chest and feel Rio’s heart in her hand.</p><p align="left">When those words left Rio’s mouth, Agatha’s breath hitched as she swallowed so hard that Rio was able to hear it, but she didn't offer a verbal response. Agatha took Rio’s hand from her chest and kissed the back of it several times with tenderness and warmth.</p><p align="left">A few minutes passed with them sitting in the car in the parking lot, pressing their foreheads, feeling each other’s heartbeats and listening to every deep inhale and a shaking exhale.</p><p align="left">Rio opened her eyes and looked at Agatha. The moment she did, her heart tightened in her chest as a sudden strike made her breaths heavier. Looking at Agatha like that filled her body and soul with feelings she was afraid to put a name to.</p><p align="left">They pulled away, sitting in their seats and Agatha started the engine. </p><p align="left">She looked at Rio, and a soft smile was painted on her lips, not like her usual smirks. But her eyes were still full of hunger, it grew even sharper.</p><p align="left">Agatha drove them, Rio wasn't sure if she was going to take them to her house or Agatha’s—or if she wouldn't even take them anywhere and just fuck Rio in the back of the car.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s hand didn't hesitate this time. She put her hand on Rio’s thigh, softly brushing above the fabric.</p><p align="left">Rio at that moment realized that not wearing her coat back—because her body was burning and she only tossed it in the back seat—was a wrong move, because Agatha’s fingers were drifting to the slit of her dress. Dangerously close.</p><p align="left">But every time Agatha brushed her fingers, she moved them higher or lower, passing her path to the burning exposed skin. Never touching it.</p><p align="left">Rio managed to stay silent, swallowing every little sound. But Agatha didn't seem fond of that. She'd look to the side and see Rio squirming and breathing heavily in her seat and she'd smirk, but she still needed to hear Rio.</p><p align="left">So this time, her fingers had a purpose, she moved them up and down the slit, while her eyes stayed on the road in front of her. She pushed the fabric aside—the fabric that Rio tried so hard to pull together so her thigh would stay covered since she got into the car—and Agatha’s chill fingertips made a connection with Rio’s hot skin. At that Rio let out a whimper, unable to hold it back, and that seemed to satisfy Agatha, but she didn't stop.</p><p align="left">Her fingers went higher, she even moved her body slightly so she could extend her hand more and Rio forced her eyes closed at the torturing, yet, delightful sensation.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s fingers touched the wet curly hair between Rio’s thighs and she closed her eyes with a heavy sigh—she probably forgot that Rio wasn't wearing underwear, or maybe she <em>needed</em> to savour it.</p><p align="left">Rio’s eyes opened.</p><p align="left">“<em>Eyes on the road, Agatha.</em>” Rio said breathlessly. Her voice was small and affected.</p><p align="left">Agatha opened her eyes and looked at Rio, then back to the road.</p><p align="left">“Are you going to ruin the seats, Rio?” Agatha asked with her sultry, deep voice that made Rio drip down on the seat underneath her.</p><p align="left">“<em>No,</em>” Rio softly moaned.</p><p align="left">“Oh? Because you're <em>dripping</em> all over them.”</p><p align="left">“I'm—I'm aware of that,” Rio said with a heavy sigh as she felt Agatha’s long fingers spreading the drenched folds.</p><p align="left">“You are?” Agatha looked at her. “You should’ve thought about it before coming without your underwear on.” Her gaze flicked to the road.</p><p align="left">The tone Agatha used was deep and low, as she was trying to mask how affected she was by all of this, as if she could cover anything really.</p><p align="left">“You should’ve thought about wearing a bra, because I can see your hard nipples from here,” Rio remarked as she rested her head on the seat and a moan escaped her throat when Agatha’s fingers started rubbing her throbbing clit.</p><p align="left">She wasn't realeable to see Agatha’s <em>hard nipples</em> but she wanted to comment something about them.</p><p align="left">“Yeah, that's because you drive even my fucking nipples to go insane.” </p><p align="left">Hearing that made Rio’s body twitch in response as a shiver ran down her spine all the way to her cunt and made it clench around nothing.</p><p align="left">Agatha kept the slow, agonizing pace on Rio’s clit— the pace that was driving Rio insane in the most pleasurable way—and she was close to coming undone already. She felt Agatha’s fingers slow even more, threatening to leave, because Agatha had to make a turn.</p><p align="left">“<em>No, please.</em>”</p><p align="left">“I have to,” and Agatha withdrew her silk-coated fingers and put them on the steering wheel.</p><p align="left">“I was <em>so</em> close,” Rio whined at the loss.</p><p align="left">“Yeah, I know” Agatha bit her bottom lip slightly as her eyes gleamed.</p><p align="left">After making the turn, Agatha’s fingers didn't move back to resume their work. Even when Rio tried so hard to make Agatha do something. By ‘so hard’ she was only looking at Agatha with pleading, dark eyes while remaining silent. Her face was flushed red from the alcohol in her system, from how turned on she was, and because of how Agatha had denied her. </p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her, smirking wickedly.</p><p align="left">“What?” She asked, looking at how Rio was staring at her.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't say a thing, she only pouted slightly and kept looking at Agatha with gleaming eyes.</p><p align="left">“We'll be home soon, try to manage it,” Agatha said.</p><p align="left">Still, Rio only looked at her side profile while staying completely silent, her breaths were the only sound filling the atmosphere.</p><p align="left">Rio’s fingers moved on her dress, entered the slit, and reached her heat. She moved one of her legs slightly higher to have more space while keeping her eyes locked on Agatha and how her jacket was fucking open, slightly pulled to the side and the side of her breast was visible for Rio to stare at.</p><p align="left">Rio’s breath hitched slightly and at the same second that happened, Agatha looked at her.</p><p align="left">Her eyes widened and darkened at the same time, the blue in her eyes got completely swallowed.</p><p align="left">“What…” she licked her dry lips, “What are you doing?”</p><p align="left">“<em>You told me to manage it,</em>” Rio breathed out as she gathered the evidence of her arousal and spread it before she started to rub her clit the way she needed.</p><p align="left">“Fuck, keep going,” Agatha encouraged and her hand flew to land a rough hold on Rio’s thigh, spreading her legs even wider and Rio was <em>fucking</em> grateful for that.</p><p align="left">“Touch yourself for me. Come on, baby.” and Rio did, the encouragement from Agatha was doing wonders to her helpless state. It made her fingers move insanely quicker as if she had lost all control over herself.</p><p align="left">Thank god they were on a highway.</p><p align="left">A moan escaped Rio’s throat, high and lustful. Agatha looked at her and their eyes locked. Both of their irises were completely swallowed.</p><p align="left">“I bet you've done that before. Touched yourself while wearing <em>this</em>,” Agatha said as she drifted her eyes to lool at Rio’s black dress.</p><p align="left">The sounds of Rio’s fingers moving on her drenched cunt, the rubbing sounds on her clit, her heavy breaths and soft moans filled the car.</p><p align="left">“<em>I did</em>,” Rio confessed with a moan.</p><p align="left">“Of course you did,” Agatha remarked, her voice was low and heavy. “I <em>knew</em> you fucking did.” Her eyes dropped down to Rio’s hands, then up to her half-lidded eyes. Agatha licked her lips then her gaze shifted to the road ahead of them.</p><p align="left">Rio continued touching herself, it didn't matter how absurd the situation looked—fucking herself in Agatha’s car <em>in front</em> of Agatha—if anything, it only made Rio want to keep going. Because being watched by Agatha fucked her head sideways.</p><p align="left">Even though she was close to her orgasm, <em>so close</em>, it seemed like she couldn't reach it. Because those weren’t Agatha’s fingers and she <em>so</em> desperately and <em>so</em> eagerly needed them in her <em>and</em> on her. Rio knew if Agatha would only move her fingers slightly, she  would cum immediately because she was craving her touch. Yearning for it.</p><p align="left">“<em>Agatha…</em>” She called her, Agatha’s name was wrapped in a breathy moan that made Agatha’s head snap to the side.</p><p align="left">“Hmm?” She hummed in question.</p><p align="left">“I’m so close<em>… Please </em>just touch me?” Rio pleaded with desperation. </p><p align="left">Sge was too engaged in this, so invested in the way that she was at Agatha’s mercy. All of the teasing and denying was making her burn in arousal and need.</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh, baby.</em>” Agatha breathed out with a mocking pout. “You've done it before, so do it now. My hands are occupied.” she said, intending to sound mean, and her voice did that job—but her dark eyes? The way she twitched slightly after hearing Rio beg her and ask her to touch her? Those betrayed her. Her body showed it all despite how hard she was trying to mask it.</p><p align="left">“Come on. You're a big girl, I know you can manage it,” Agatha said, wetting her dry lips for the hundredth time. Because no matter how many times she ran her tongue over them, they remained dry because of the sight in front of her.</p><p align="left">The praise did something to Rio’s system. She felt herself getting wetter and felt the way the dress under her started to get moist. But that didn't help her to reach the orgasm she so desperately needed. Instead, it worsened the situation. </p><p align="left">She resumed touching herself, and it felt like she was doing it from the start all over again. But the way she was drenched and how her body twitched once she touched her clit showed otherwise. </p><p align="left">She thought about adding her fingers, but the space was tight for her. So Rio unbuckled her seatbelt and lifted her body, about to move to the backseat to get the space she needed.</p><p align="left">“Absolutely not. <em>Sit down.</em>” Agatha spoke, the command in her voice made Rio sit right back, any brattiness she was about to use wouldn't have worked anyway.</p><p align="left">“You're so mean.”</p><p align="left">“I know, but maybe you should learn some self-control?”</p><p align="left">Agatha mentioned <em>self-control</em> and Rio’s hand started moving on her clit the same second, as if Agatha were talking to a wall.</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled, absolutely affected by the act.</p><p align="left">“Just talk to me then, please? I need to cum. Please, Agatha.”</p><p align="left">“What do you want me to say? That I will fuck you senseless tonight? Fuck you until you can't say your name again? Make your beautiful pussy swollen? Make you beg me to stop? Hmm? That's what you want?”</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh fuck. Oh fuck!</em>” Rio moaned </p><p align="left">“You'd like me to ruin you?”</p><p align="left">“<em>Y-yes. Yes, I do. Yes,</em>”</p><p align="left">“Mhm. Come on, you can cum for me.”</p><p align="left">“I want to, but I can't. I need you.”</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled. She moved her fingers and replaced Rio’s on the throbbing clit.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuckfuckfuck...</em>”</p><p align="left">Rio threw her head back as she closed her eyes. </p><p align="left">She felt it, <em>there</em>, she just needed one more touch.</p><p align="left">And fuck, Rio opened her eyes as she felt Agatha’s hand move away.</p><p align="left">“W-why?” Rio whined. She was on the edge of crying because Agatha was being so fucking intolerable and she kept denying her.</p><p align="left">“Put your legs down, we're almost home.” Agatha said as if it was nothing.</p><p align="left">“But I was close. <em>So close.</em>”</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't say anything. She just kept driving. And Rio felt herself on the edge of exploding.</p><p align="left">They arrived at Agatha's house.</p><p align="left">Agatha unfastened her seatbelt calmly, while Rio did it in a hurry. She got out of the car before Agatha did. </p><p align="left">Agatha walked to open the door and Rio was walking behind her.</p><p align="left">The moment Agatha unlocked the door, she grabbed Rio’s wrist from behind, pushed the door open, and stormed inside while pulling Rio with her.</p><p align="left">She shoved Rio to the wall next to the door and crashed her lips into Rio’s. Kissing her with obvious lust and hunger. Agatha needed to be fed, because she was just as affected as Rio was.</p><p align="left">She pinned Rio’s hips to the wall while holding them tightly in a way that was <em>absolutely</em> maddening. </p><p align="left">Agatha kissed Rio like there was no tomorrow. Like her mouth won't be meeting Rio’s anytime soon. But the truth was—that kiss was the beginning of too many others that will be uncountable.</p><p align="left">Rio surrendered completely to Agatha’s mouth and hold the moment she felt Agatha’s hips become flush against hers. </p><p align="left">She gave up to Agatha’s tongue, letting it consume her, taking what it wanted and needed. She only let out soft moans that would have been walls-crushing if Agatha’s mouth wasn't devouring hers.</p><p align="left">Even if Rio didn't surrender to Agatha, she knew Agatha would take the control either way, Agatha made that clear from the first time her fingers rewarded Rio with an orgasm on that kitchen island.</p><p align="left">When air became a necessity, Agatha pulled back slightly. Their faces remained so close and they shared the same thick air.</p><p align="left">The next second, Agatha took hold of both of Rio’s wrists with one of hers and pinned them above Rio’s head on the wall. Agatha’s other hand rested on the small of Rio’s back through the small space between Rio’s body and the wall.</p><p align="left">She pushed Rio’s body forward just slightly, then she held some amount of fabric from Rio’s dress and pulled it back, making the dress tighter, <em>tighter</em> on Rio’s body. Making her curves more visible for her eyes to see.</p><p align="left">Her navel, her hip bones, her nipples were hard and visible even through the two layers of fabric covering them.</p><p align="left">The moment Agatha did that, she didn't even look up at Rio. Her gaze traveled down to Rio’s body and Agatha’s breath hitched. She looked and kept looking, wetting her lips every few seconds.</p><p align="left">Rio was too far gone, because the way Agatha was looking at her made her burn. Made her stomach clench as a shiver ran down her spine and made her body twitch slightly.</p><p align="left">The pleasure and the amount of arousal Rio got from every time Agatha looked at her were indescribable. Things that absolutely could not be put into words, things she could only feel. </p><p align="left">The pleasure of being looked at. Of being absorbed with eyes. Examined lustfuly. Studied hungerily.</p><p align="left">Agatha lifted her eyes up and locked them with Rio’s. What Rio saw there alarmed her of what was coming, because Agatha was looking with fucking famishment. As if mouths and fangs grew in her eyes, devouring Rio with just a look.</p><p align="left">“Do you know how fucking beautiful you look right now? Do you know how you drive me fucking insane? Are you aware of that, Rio?”</p><p align="left">Rio didn't provide answers, because she knew those weren’t questions, those were statements. </p><p align="left">Agatha pulled the dress back even more, making it shorter from how much fabric she fisted. And more pressure was applied to the hold she had on Rio’s wrists.</p><p align="left">Agatha directed her leg to the slit and pulled the fabric of it to the side with her leg to make space to enter through it. She lifted her knee up and immediately pushed on Rio’s bare, dripping cunt. </p><p align="left">Rio moaned, a hot breathy sound left her throat the moment Agatha started putting more pressure in a circular motion. At the same time, she pushed Rio’s legs wider, so her clothed knee was directly under Rio’s cunt.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s eyes were fixed on Rio’s body, looking at it as she continued pushing, pulling and pinning.</p><p align="left">She lifted her gaze up once again and another moan escaped Rio’s throat—it was louder as she felt Agatha’s clothed knee directly moving on her clit.</p><p align="left">“This body is <em>mine</em>, Rio. And nobody else’s. Nobody gets to see this perfection, this masterpiece of a body. Nobody gets to worship it but me. Nobody gets to appreciate every curve and detail of your body but me. It's mine, Rio. Your body is mine.”</p><p align="left">“<em>I’m yours.</em>”</p><p align="left">“<em>You are.</em>”</p><p align="left">Agatha crashed their mouths together. Sucking and nipping on Rio’s swollen lips. </p><p align="left">They pulled back again, and Agatha’s knee didn't slow down. She was determined on making Rio cum on her pants.</p><p align="left">A couple of seconds passed and Rio came with a loud cry, her body shivered as her orgasm tore through her. Her orgasm was explosive, intense and searing. After being denied in a harsh-pleasurable way, it was fucking worth it.  Her orgasm was long, it felt like it wouldn't even end.</p><p align="left">And before she knew it, another orgasm tore through her, making her body shudder forcefully.</p><p align="left">“<em>Agatha…</em>” She moaned Agatha’s name, which at that point wasn't just a name. It was her salvation.</p><p align="left">Agatha kept her knee there as she slowed the pace, waited for Rio to calm down and for her body to be steady, then she put her leg down on the floor. </p><p align="left">She locked eyes with Rio and kissed her again—with more fervour and heat. The tender kisses were too far gone.</p><p align="left">They pulled away and Agatha released the fabric of Rio’s dress as set her wrists free. Then her eyes lowered down to her pants and the circular-shaped spot was dark on her knee above the fabric. Rio looked down at where Agatha was looking and then their eyes met. Rio was looking with embarrassment in her gaze, but Agatha? Agatha was fucking delighted.</p><p align="left">So she pushed her fingers inside Rio’s sensitive cunt and collected a great amount of her arousal. </p><p align="left">Rio was sensitive and her body seemed to recognize Agatha’s fingers, so it warned her with a shiver to run through her entire body. Swirling inside like a current.</p><p align="left">Agatha withdrew her fingers and she looked at her wet, glistening fingers. She shoved them into Rio’s mouth the next second, which Rio was glad to suck them clean.</p><p align="left">Before Rio was able to complete the task and suck her mess, Agatha took her fingers out of Rio’s mouth. She put them in her own, and sucked her now silva-coated fingers with the great smell, taste and texture of Rio’s cunt.</p><p align="left">Her fingers were all Rio.</p><p align="left">Agatha hummed around her own fingers in pleasure as she locked eyes with Rio. Then she leaned in after taking her fingers out of her mouth and pressed a kiss to Rio’s lips. Then she drifted lower, kissing her neck and sucking on her pulse point, pulling loud moans from Rio’s throat. </p><p align="left">Then Agatha started going even lower, she put both of her hands on the wall, technically caging Rio, and she started kissing Rio’s breasts above the fabric. Lower to Rio’s clothed abdomen. Her contoured navel.</p><p align="left">With the way Agatha’s body and mouth were going down, Rio felt herself floating. </p><p align="left">Agatha continued her kisses that weren’t only kisses, they were prayers of worship.</p><p align="left">She kissed both of Rio’s hip bones and she kissed Rio’s cunt from above the fabric. She continued her act of praying, kissing Rio’s thighs, knees, shins, and ankles, until she reached her shoes. </p><p align="left">Agatha kneeled on one knee as she looked up at Rio with starved gaze.</p><p align="left">Rio looked dizzy with lust and anticipation. </p><p align="left">Agatha took one of Rio’s legs and put it on her knee, then she took Rio’s shoes off and trailed her mouth on the soft skin of her shin once again, kissing it lovingly before putting the leg down and repeating the act with the other one. Treating it equally.</p><p align="left">This act of worshipping was something sacred for Rio. Something she'd never experienced before. To feel like a goddess underneath the touches and kisses of a woman like Agatha was something unbelievable—because Rio literally felt herself being <em>worshipped</em>.</p><p align="left">And at the same time, she felt undeserving of it all and there her mind started drifting.</p><p align="left">But before she could get lost in the maze of her thoughts, Agatha spoke as she kissed Rio’s body all the way up until she stood on her feet again.</p><p align="left">“Never in my life have I seen a woman like you, Rio.” Agatha confessed then she pressed a kiss to one of Rio’s collarbones</p><p align="left">“And trust me... I've <em>never</em> said that to any other woman but you.”</p><p align="left">Then the other one.</p><p align="left">Rio understood why she felt like a goddess being worshipped, but to feel as a <em>shrine</em> herself while she stood there? That she couldn't fathom.</p><p align="left">Agatha took hold of Rio’s palm and held it tightly.</p><p align="left">“Go upstairs,”</p><p align="left">Rio nodded,</p><p align="left">“If you're thinking about taking the dress off, then don't do it.”</p><p align="left">Then she leaned in and kissed Rio lustfully.</p><p align="left">Rio got upstairs. She stepped into Agatha’s bedroom, and the room this time had more lights on and it was more occupied—other stuff and pieces of furniture were added to the space.</p><p align="left">Rio looked around the room as she sat down on the edge of the bed with anxious and anticipation she was intertwining her fingers on her lap.</p><p align="left">Then Agatha stepped inside with two bottles of water in her hands and her face glistened from the water that remained on her face from washing it.</p><p align="left">Rio took the bottle from her hand and drank more than half of it in one gulp. </p><p align="left">She leaned on her back afterward then rolled to the side, looking at Agatha.</p><p align="left">“Are you okay?” Agatha asked as she sat on the bed next to Rio.</p><p align="left">Rio nodded and a soft smile was painted on her lips.</p><p align="left">“More than okay. But I need to see you.” Rio whispered the last words as her fingers reached out, playing with the button of Agatha’s jacket. </p><p align="left">“Go ahead.”</p><p align="left">The moment the permission was granted, Rio sat on her heels next to Agatha. </p><p align="left">She opened the two buttons on the jacket, and instead of pulling the jacket off Agatha's shoulders, Rio rested her palm in the soft skin of the valley between Agatha’s breasts.</p><p align="left">Hot skin met hot skin. </p><p align="left">Their eyes locked as Rio started massaging the skin, going up and down tenderly. Then she took the jacket off, and was met with a blessing of a view. Agatha’s chest was a perfection. Her pale skin, the way her breasts looked perfect and delicious. The rosy, hard nipples made Rio’s mouth water. She kept staring as she lifted one of her hands up and took a nipple between her thumb and index finger, rolling it and squeezing it moderately.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s mouth was slightly open, but no sound was coming out of it.</p><p align="left">Rio took the other nipple with her fingers, giving it the same amount of attention as her other hand drifted lower to unbutton and unzip Agatha’s pants.</p><p align="left">Agatha lifted her body up and Rio managed to pull the piece of garment off. </p><p align="left">Rio looked at Agatha’s knee that was wrapped in a bandage and a sense of panic rushed to her system.</p><p align="left">“What happened?”</p><p align="left">“Oh, it's nothing really, just a mild sprain.”</p><p align="left">“How—What happened?” Rio asked again as she stretched Agatha’s injured leg to lay down.</p><p align="left">“I was moving some furniture, and it just happened. Probably because I turned my body too fast.”</p><p align="left">“Did you go see a doctor?” Rio asked as she so tenderly and gently started moving her hands on the bandage. Not even literally on it, just a ghost of a contact, afraid she'd hurt Agatha in any way.</p><p align="left">“No, I didn't. It's nothing, Rio.” Agatha said. “Honestly it's nothing, don't look at me like that.” Agatha chuckled as she saw the look on Rio’s face.</p><p align="left">She leaned in and cupped Rio’s face with both of her hands. “I'm fine.” Then she leaned even closer and took Rio’s slightly pouted lips in a tenderly sweet kiss.</p><p align="left">When they pulled back, Rio still looked unconvinced. </p><p align="left">“What do you want me to do to prove that it's not serious?” Agatha asked while brushing her thumb on Rio’s cheek.</p><p align="left">“Go see a doctor, for example.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, I will.” Agatha said and then stole a sweet peek from Rio’s lips. </p><p align="left">The atmosphere changed instantly and became charged and thick again once Agatha took Rio’s hand and guided it to her clothed cunt. </p><p align="left">She used Rio’s hand, moving it up and down. Agatha didn't moan at the contact, but Rio did. Feeling the heat of Agatha radiating through the thin fabric made her heart race.</p><p align="left">After a few seconds Agatha stopped the movements but kept her hold on Rio’s hand.</p><p align="left">“Take it off,” Agatha said, looking Rio directly in the eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio understood what was being asked so she got up from the bed and stood on her feet. </p><p align="left">She took hold of the fabric and looked at Agatha for guidance on how to do it. Because she knew Agatha needed a show and she was willing to perform.</p><p align="left">“Go slowly,” Agatha licked her lips and Rio obliged.</p><p align="left">Making a show of taking the dress off, gradually showing more and more of her tanned skin.</p><p align="left">Agatha propped herself up on her arms, looking at Rio in front of her with lust.</p><p align="left">“<em>You're ravishing</em>.” Another lip-lick. Agatha was getting hungrier and hungrier, needing to devour. </p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck. </em>Come here, gorgeous. Let me take it off myself,”</p><p align="left">Rio obliged once again and got in the bed again.</p><p align="left">Agatha sat straight and took the dress off herself, much quicker than Rio had anticipated.</p><p align="left">Once the garment was off her body and was thrown somewhere, Agatha looked at Rio's body, then back to her eyes and she took Rio’s lips in a messy, heated kiss.</p><p align="left">As they kissed, Agatha managed to guide Rio’s body to sit against the headboard during it.</p><p align="left">She pulled back and Rio’s body started trembling. Her body was clearly affected, as if this was the first kiss they had shared. As if this was Rio's first kiss <em>ever</em>.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned back in and took Rio's swollen lips in, yer, another lustful kiss as her hands roamed on Rio’s body, touching it with precision.</p><p align="left">One of her hands went behind Rio’s back and unclipped her black bra within a second. Once it fell down, Rio became completely bare for the second time in front of Agatha.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s hand cupped both of her breasts and she started kneading them with a circular motion of her palms.</p><p align="left">“<em>Majestueuse,</em>” she whispered near Rio’s mouth and continued kissing her as her palms continued their movement.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s leg went between Rio’s, putting pressure on her most sensitive part in her body—the part that despite its sensitivity, still begged to be touched and ruined by leaking.</p><p align="left">The moment their mouths parted, a thin string of saliva connected their lips from the bottom, Rio let out a loud moan at the attention her body was getting.</p><p align="left">A moan she was most likely holding the entire night. Or maybe since she locked eyes with Agatha for the first time ever.</p><p align="left">Because it was loud. It was crushing—charging the room with her pleasure. It was more like a scream. A heated, lustful one </p><p align="left">Rio hadn’t been given this attention. Hadn’t been touched like this. Looked at like this in years. Or maybe never. She'd never been <em>this</em> touched. She'd never felt touches on her body like Agatha’s, because there weren’t any.</p><p align="left">“It terrifies me how much I need you, Agatha,” Rio breathlessly confessed as Agatha added more and more pressure while using her leg.</p><p align="left">“Don't be terrified. Because I need you just as much,” Agatha said, leaning in to kiss Rio’s exposed throat. “<em>Even more.</em>” She added through a heavy sigh.</p><p align="left">Agatha laid Rio’s body down, making her head rest on the soft, dark-purple-velvet pillows.</p><p align="left">Her leg stopped and was replaced by her hand. She rubbed on Rio’s clit slightly with her thumb and Rio’s legs instinctively parted even wider. Feeling the delicious, burning stretch in her thigh muscles.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s index and middle fingers moved on her slit, up and down, until one of them entered Rio with ease and Rio moaned a heavy, breathy moan.</p><p align="left">Agatha stretched the tight hole deliberately and as she was about to add another finger, Rio voiced “<em>More, please,</em>” and Agatha did, adding a second one of her long fingers.</p><p align="left">Then a third.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck,</em>” </p><p align="left">Agatha started thrusting with the three fingers, as her thumb kept rubbing on Rio’s swollen clit.</p><p align="left">A low moan escaped Agatha’s throat as she felt the way Rio was swallowing her fingers completely while she looked at how flushed and breathless Rio was underneath her. Her chest was heavily rising and falling without a way to steady it.</p><p align="left">“Relax your body for me,” Agatha said as their eyes locked with intensity. </p><p align="left">“<em>I can't. Not when I'm so… so full of you,</em>”</p><p align="left">Agatha’s other thumb brushed Rio’s bottom lip slightly, making her mouth part instinctively. </p><p align="left">“<em>Relax for me, baby,</em>”</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her, then she closed her eyes briefly as she inhaled deeply through her nose and exhaled through her mouth. The warm breath hit the tip of Agatha’s thumb.</p><p align="left">“Do it again.” </p><p align="left">And Rio did, several times. Her body relaxed under Agatha’s supervision and encouragement as her muscles loosened.</p><p align="left">The slow pace Agatha used while Rio was breathing was too far gone, she started thrusting with three of her fingers at a fast speed, penetrating Rio completely. Her fingers hit Rio’s g-spot with every thrust.</p><p align="left">Rio cried out. Cursing and moaning Agatha’s name as the thrusting became even faster.</p><p align="left">Her hands were gripping the sheets tightly by her sides. Desperate to hold something.</p><p align="left">A shin of sweat glistened her forehead. Rio closed her eyes and the sounds of Agatha’s fingers pumping inside her filled her ears.</p><p align="left">“<em>I'm close,</em>”</p><p align="left">“I know, cum for me. Come on, baby,”</p><p align="left">“<em>I'm gonna</em><em>…</em>”</p><p align="left">“<em>Do it. Come on, ruin those sheets for me. I know you can do it,</em>”</p><p align="left">And she did. Rio came all over Agatha’s fingers, her orgasm exploded through her. Warm liquid managed to gush out between Agatha’s fingers, ruining the sheets exactly as she had been asked to do.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck, oh my… fuck.</em>”</p><p align="left">Her orgasm continued going on and her body was still trembling. Agatha’s fingers continued thrusting inside as the warm liquid kept gushing out.</p><p align="left">Agatha moved her fingers and looked down at Rio’s cunt—the way it continued to clench even after Agatha had removed her fingers and the short waves of juices were still cutting through.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck, Agatha…</em>” Rio moaned, trembling, as she tried to gasp for air.</p><p align="left">“So fucking beautiful and <em>so</em> goddamn impressive. Jesus… Do you think you can do that again?”</p><p align="left">Agatha asked while looking at Rio with affection and pure delight.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't respond, she took her time to regain her composure. </p><p align="left">“I didn't even know I could do that… like this—this much, I mean…” Rio confessed. She was still breathless as her grip on the sheets loosened.</p><p align="left">Agatha moved her fingers on Rio’s slit again, and her body twitched as her thigh muscles tensed. “<em>I think I can…</em>” Rio answered the question with a moan.</p><p align="left">“Good.” Agatha said. Then she sat down, took Rio’s legs and put them on her shoulders, then she leaned in, her warm mouth making a connection with Rio’s sensitive heat.</p><p align="left">Her long tongue went over and over Rio’s cunt, licking and sucking it, not wasting a drop.</p><p align="left">Rio’s hips jerked up as she felt a little overwhelmed and Agatha looked up at her. </p><p align="left">“Do you want me to stop?”</p><p align="left">“<em>No… just—can you wait please?</em>” </p><p align="left">“Of course. Do you need anything?”</p><p align="left">“Yes.”</p><p align="left">“Hmm? What is it?” Agatha sat on her heels as Rio’s legs remained on her shoulders. “Anything, just say it.”</p><p align="left">“Can you take this off and come sit on my face?” Rio asked, pointing at how Agatha was still wearing her underwear.</p><p align="left">And Agatha did, she took her leopard thong off, and came to straddle Rio’s face.</p><p align="left">Rio licked her lips.</p><p align="left">“Wait…”</p><p align="left">Rio said as she sat down. “Let me look at you first?”</p><p align="left">Agatha’s tongue moved left and right on her bottom lip. </p><p align="left">Then she crawled up the bed until she sat against the headboard where Rio was sitting earlier. Without Rio saying anything, Agatha spread her legs and gave Rio the view she <em>so</em> fucking desperately wanted to see.</p><p align="left">Rio’s breath quickened rapidly and her eyes darkened—if Rio was drenched then what was Agatha? She was <em>fucking submerged</em>.</p><p align="left">To the point that once she spread her legs, the smell of her flooded Rio’s senses. She inhaled the intoxicating, strong scent and her eyes traveled uo to meet Agatha’s, then Rio sat on her fours and crawled her way to Agatha’s cunt.</p><p align="left">If the scent was strong before, as Rio became closer, it was <em>saturating</em>, making Rio’s head dizzy with lust.</p><p align="left">She sat on her heels and started moving her fingers on Agatha’s slit, testing the texture of it, the feeling of it.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s breath hitched noticeably and her eyes were half-opened.</p><p align="left">Rio put the tip of her middle finger on Agatha’s entrance, and pushed half of it inside.</p><p align="left">“You've been this wet the entire night?”</p><p align="left">“Yes, Rio. Every time I looked at you, I felt myself getting more and more soaked.” Agatha sighed heavily. “<em>Because of you... For you.</em>”</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh, god.</em>”</p><p align="left">“Mhm. Now, will you let me ruin your pretty face? Hmm?”</p><p align="left">“Please, fucking use me,”</p><p align="left">Rio lay down on her back after looking at Agatha for minutes.</p><p align="left">Agatha sat on her face, both of her hands using the headboard for balance.</p><p align="left">She rode Rio’s face, used her tongue and nose to bring her closer and closer to the edge. She kept riding and moving her cunt on Rio’s tongue and Rio was fucking glad to be used for Agatha’s pleasure.</p><p align="left">The taste of Agatha, the smell of her, the weight of her, the feeling of her—those what mattered. Those things filled Rio’s head entirely, leaving no space for anything else. She was floating.</p><p align="left">Agatha came with a loud scream. Her orgasm tore through her, making her tremble while sitting on Rio’s face. <em>Her seat of relief</em>. Her orgasm was a kind of an explosion, a compensation for the ones she held inside all night.</p><p align="left">After her body calmed down. She sat on the bed again and started kissing Rio while embracing her, holding her body tightly.</p><hr/><p align="left">After a few more orgasms, they were drained and exhausted. The sheets were completely ruined. Their voices were hoarse; they’d lost them to the screams of pleasure. The room was filled with the smell of sweat and sex. The atmosphere was thick with satisfaction and heat. </p><p align="left">Their sweaty, tired bodies were flush against each other, embracing with peace and safety, kissing each other’s salty and warm skin.</p><p align="left">Rio buried her face in the crook of Agatha’s neck, feeling her chest raising and falling steadily against hers.</p><p align="left">“Let's take a shower,” Agatha said after a few minutes of silence, squeezing Rio’s arm gently.</p><p align="left">Rio looked up at her then leaned in to kiss her chin.</p><p align="left">“How’s your knee?”</p><p align="left">“Fine. I wasn't feeling it most of the time. Too lost, I guess,” Agatha said with a warm chuckle.</p><p align="left">Rio hummed in response.</p><p align="left">“Does it hurt?”</p><p align="left">“A little, yes, but nothing I'm not used to.”</p><p align="left">“Did you get hurt when your phone fell down and called me?” Rio said with a smile of amusement as she remembered.</p><p align="left">Agatha laughed a breathy laugh, a sound that was so intoxicating and addictive.</p><p align="left">“Yes, it was.”</p><p align="left">Rio smiled widely.</p><p align="left">Then they got up. Agatha helped Rio to stand on her feet because her body was sore and too weak to hold her weight. They got into the bathroom and Agatha turned on the water to run a bath for them both.</p><p align="left">She helped Rio get in gently and made sure she sat down without any sign of hurting, even if it was simple.</p><p align="left">She kissed Rio’s temple.</p><p align="left">“I'll be right back.”</p><p align="left">Rio nodded and Agatha kissed her again then she stepped out.</p><p align="left">The silence of the bathroom and the feeling of the warm water on her body made her relax and close her eyes without moving.</p><p align="left">She didn't open her eyes until she felt Agatha come in.</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled at her, that soft, tender, sweet smile that made Rio feel like she won the entire world by just simply looking at it. By receiving it.</p><p align="left">And Rio smiled at her in return. Reflecting Agatha's contagious smile.</p><p align="left">“Do you by any chance keep some cigarettes in here?” Rio asked as she looked at the tall, white cabinet, joking about how it was full of stuff.</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled.</p><p align="left">“Actually…” she said after opening the lower door of it. “I do. Because I like smoking while I'm sitting in the bath. Does wonders to me.”</p><p align="left">Rio’s eyes widened slightly, because she only said it as a joke.</p><p align="left">Agatha grabbed the pack of cigarettes and a lighter as well, and put them near them.</p><p align="left">Then she joined Rio after taking the bandage off. </p><p align="left">Rio’s back was against Agatha’s front, sitting between her legs. Agatha washed Rio’s body tenderly. She apologized with a whispered “<em>I'm sorry,</em>” and a soft kiss every time Rio’s body twitched as a reaction to how sensitive she was.</p><p align="left">All the sweat on their bodies and the juicy evidence of their long, pleasurable night got washed out, but their scents and touches on each other’s body lingered.</p><p align="left">They sat there, in the warmth of the water facing each other. Looking at each other’s faces. Staring at one another's soft eyes and finding a safe home in there.</p><p align="left">Nothing mattered but <em>this</em>. </p><p align="left">Agatha reached out for the cigarettes, handed one to Rio and put one between her lips. She leaned in and lit Rio’s, then hers.</p><p align="left">“Second time we smoke together, huh?” Rio said as she laid Agatha’s injured leg in the water and started massaging her knee gently. Moving her hand on it, tender fingertips touching with care.</p><p align="left">“Yes,” Agatha smiled and blew a cloud of grey smoke into the space between them. </p><p align="left">Their smoking break came to an end. Agatha took the cigarette butts and threw them in the garbage. Then they dried off.</p><p align="left">They brushed their teeth together, the feeling of domesticity hit Rio right in the chest. Because it was a simple act, but it was genuine. It was peaceful.</p><p align="left">They stepped inside the bedroom again, new sheets were laid out and adjusted.</p><p align="left">Agatha gave Rio two options, a sky-blue robe or a long t-shirt and underwear. And Rio obviously picked the second option. She put them on and Agatha wore her silky purple robe.</p><p align="left">Agatha gave her a bottle of water, which Rio drank it all without a pause.</p><p align="left">“Do you have some kind of cream or something to put on your knee?” Rio asked and Agatha nodded.</p><p align="left">She handed it to Rio, who told her she wanted to do it. Rio applied the cream to the injured knee, the sharp, minty scent of it filled their noses. She applied it gently while massaging the injury with practiced hands.</p><p align="left">Then she wrapped it with a new, clean bandage and gave Agatha’s knee a gentle kiss—and Agatha reacted with that beautiful smile of hers at that.</p><p align="left">They lay down on the bed again, Agatha holding Rio’s body securely, wrapping her with warmth and peacefulness. Rio’s head rested on Agatha’s chest, and their legs tangled underneath the soft duvet.</p><p align="left">And they slept, lulled by the sound of their heartbeats and steady breaths.</p>

<p align="center"><em>Paint the town red</em><br/><em>And paint me in blue</em><br/><em>Shower me in lilac</em><br/><em>The color purple always suited you</em></p><hr/><p align="left">What Rio felt as she opened her eyes and sensed a head deeply buried in her neck was the real definition of happiness, and when she looked down and saw who it was, she sure as hell felt something undefined yet, and probably will always remain that way—undefined.</p><p align="left">When Rio fell asleep hours earlier, her head was deeply buried in Agatha’s neck. Agatha’s calming scent, her warm skin, her gentle fingertips brushing Rio’s arm, her soothing embrace, and Agatha’s last words when she whispered, “<em>Good night,</em>” as she kissed the top of Rio’s head before Rio’s eyes grew irresistibly heavy—those were the things that Rio fell asleep to.</p><p align="left">So to wake up to such a sight was something she didn't think of. She didn't think it was even possible. The way Agatha’s nose was <em>literally</em> resting on Rio’s pulse point, one of her arms was embracing Rio's waist softly, but it was a really tight hold for someone who was asleep. Agatha’s upper body was flush against Rio’s, not a single inch of space between them, and one of her legs was resting between Rio’s, which was the main reason that Rio woke up in the first place, aside from the warm sigh that Agatha sighed on her skin. The stimulation Rio felt every time Agatha moved slightly caused her to shiver or to take a deep breath in helplessness. </p><p align="left">She didn't want to move. Rio wanted to live in that moment forever, and just... replay it, and replay it, <em>and</em> replay it again.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't think of Agatha as someone who fancied cuddling for some reasons. Because every time they did, Rio thought it was because she was asking for it without saying the actual words, and Agatha always acted upon it without saying a thing. But at that moment? After seeing her like <em>that</em>? After feeling her like <em>that</em>? Rio felt herself melting at the sight and the feeling—becoming one with the bed.</p><p align="left">Rio moved her arm and embraced half of Agatha’s body with it, feeling the silky fabric on her skin, and her other hand went up and rested on the back of Agatha’s head, gently pulling her forward. Then she pressed a soft kiss on her hair, burying her face in those dark strands in the process and inhaling them deeply.</p><p align="left"><em>Being next to Agatha felt like rebirth—It was a rebirth.</em></p><p align="left">Right at that moment, she was able to feel the blood running in her body. Feeling her lungs being filled with air that felt and smelt like Agatha. Feeling the warmth of Agatha’s body embracing hers. Listening to Agatha’s soft breaths and feeling them as they tenderly landed on her skin. </p><p align="left"><em>Probably that was what being alive felt like. It felt like being next to Agatha.</em></p><p align="left">Rio slightly lifted her head up and glanced up at the curtains—she was able to see the sun rising through the little gap there, then she looked back at Agatha. A smile found its way to grow on Rio’s face immediately. She put a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear, her fingers lingered, touching her earlobe softly, debating whether she should wake her or try to go back to sleep. But <em>god</em>, she knew such a sight shouldn't be disturbed. This was holy by all means—but the urge to see those blue eyes staring at her, to hear Agatha’s voice, to feel her fingers on her skin, and <em>god</em> to see her smile.</p><p align="left">But Rio closed her eyes despite the urges, trying to bring sleep back to her, and she'll wait for Agatha’s blue oceans to drown her.</p><p align="left">The warmest “<em>Hey,</em>” landed on Rio’s ears. Then she opened her eyes to see the shiniest smile on Agatha’s face—it was so <em>shiny</em> and illuminating it could light a universe. But Rio took all the light of it, and she felt the seeds inside her grow, feeling a morning glory bloom within her.</p><p align="left">“Good morning.” Agatha leaned in and kissed Rio’s forehead.</p><p align="left">“Good morning,” Rio replied. The smile on her face was a reflection of Agatha’s—just like when the sunlight reflects on the glass.</p><p align="left">Agatha lifted her fingers up and started brushing Rio’s hair gently, and just like a little kitten, Rio closed her eyes as the warmth of the touch spread inside her. The feeling of Agatha’s fingers moving gently on her scalp sent a wave after wave of warm shivers to run through her, making her bring her legs closer.</p><p align="left">“Do you want to go out somewhere today?” Agatha asked after pressing a kiss to Rio’s hair beside where her fingers were still moving.</p><p align="left">“What's the other options?” She opened her eyes again, looking at those electric blue irises looking back at her, sending electric waves to run with her blood, swirling inside and making her heart pound.</p><p align="left">“We can... just stay here?”</p><p align="left">“Ah, that sounds tempting.”</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled and leaned her face closer. “Are you hungry? I made pancakes.”</p><p align="left">Rio grinned as she put her hand under her head and kept looking to her side, <em>to Agatha.</em></p><p align="left">“What?” Agatha asked with a soft smile.</p><p align="left">“Nothing, you're just so beautiful.”</p><p align="left">Agatha pouted her lips, the smile was still visible in her features, in the way her cheeks were pushing up her eyes, leaving her eyelashes to blink on each other.</p><p align="left">“I'll bring you breakfast.” Then she leaned in again and kissed Rio’s forehead. Between her eyebrows. The tip of her nose. Her lips—she lingered there, on her lips.</p><p align="left">Agatha left to the kitchen, and even though the bed was tempting to stretch and stay lying on, Rio had to get up. So she did.</p><p align="left">Rio went to the bathroom, washed her face and brushed her teeth then she sat against the headboard after adjusting the bed and checking her phone. </p><p align="left">A minute later, Agatha got in with breakfast. </p><p align="left">Honeyed pancakes, a mug of coffee, boiled eggs, and peeled tangerine on the side.</p><p align="left">“I just need to do some work, then we can do anything you want,” Agatha said as she sat against the headboard on her side of the bed and put her purple ceramic mug on the nightstand. </p><p align="left">Rio took Agatha’s hand, traced it gently with her soft eyes then she lifted it up to her lips and kissed the back of it.</p><p align="left">“Thank you.”</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to Rio's smiling lips.</p><p align="left">When Rio was about to take the first bite, Agatha put her glasses on, and Rio melted at the sight—like an ice cube. Feeling the melting water running down between her thighs.</p><p align="left"><em>God, she said she only wears them when she drives at night.</em></p><p align="left">Rio couldn't pull herself together when she was drunk, <em>of course</em> she won't when she was sober and nothing occupied her head other than the woman sitting by her side—<em>Agatha</em>.</p><p align="left">She looked fetching. Magnetic, pulling Rio in her magnetic field as if she was nothing but a small piece of metal.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked at Rio and Rio almost passed out when Agatha peered at her over the glasses.</p><p align="left">“Why aren’t you eating?”</p><p align="left">The way her nose looked right now. The way the tip of it would feel like in…</p><p align="left"><em>Nope, Rio. Focus.</em></p><p align="left">Rio held the warm mug of coffee in her hand, her eyes never looked away, afraid if she blinked she'd waste a moment of this <em>holiness</em>.</p><p align="left">“I'm eating.”</p><p align="left">“Eat, Rio. Don't look at me.”</p><p align="left">“I'm not allowed to?”</p><p align="left">“You're allowed,” Agatha chuckled. “Just eat your food, you haven't eaten anything yesterday.”</p><p align="left">“Actually... I ate,” Rio lifted up two fingers and showed them to Agatha. “<em>Twice</em>,” she smirked.</p><p align="left">Agatha shook her head slightly then looked back at the screen in front of her. The tip of her tongue moved from side to side, wetting her upper lip, as if she wanted to say something but didn't bring herself to do so. Her smirk was visible on her mouth as her tongue rested on the tip of her upper lip. And Rio’s eyes were lost there the entire time, lingering there. Fucking living there—in Agatha's tongue and the way it moved on her lips. Wishing it was her tongue instead to lick those <em>succulent</em> lips.</p><p align="left">Rio took a sip of her coffee as she studied Agatha’s side profile. The way her glasses rested on her nose, looking like <em>an ethereal being</em>. The way her mouth pouted forward in focus as her long fingers moved over the keyboard. Rio put the mug down, and while her gaze stayed in place, she reached for the tangerine.</p><p align="left">She looked at Agatha’s neck as she moved her hand up to scratch the skin there in thought—and despite the tender scratching, her pale skin turned pink immediately. Rio's eyes drifted even lower, to the way Agatha’s robe shifted slightly to the side and allowed Rio’s devouring eyes to feast on the exposed skin. Absentmindedly, Rio felt her fingers digging into the tangerine in her hand, making drops of its juice fall down into her coffee. But she paid no attention, she was still staring at Agatha and how purple was <em>literally</em> her fucking color.</p><p align="left">A long strand of dark hair fell on Agatha’s face, and Rio’s eyes drifted upward at the same time, following the movement of Agatha’s hand as she tucked the strand behind her ear. </p><p align="left">Agatha licked her lips, and Rio’s eyes dropped to them as she put a segment of tangerine in her mouth. The fruit tasted so sweet. Almost like Agatha. Even though, <em>nothing</em> would ever taste as sweet as her. </p><p align="left">“<em>Rio</em>,” Agatha called as she kept looking in front of her and typing. The way she called Rio's name was enough for Rio to know what she was asking her to do.</p><p align="left">“Hmm?” Rio hummed in response. Still staring at Agatha. Lost in her maze with no intention of finding her way out.</p><p align="left">Agatha took her glasses off and looked at Rio, but before she could say anything, Rio’s hand reached for hers.</p><p align="left">“Keep them on.”</p><p align="left">“What?”</p><p align="left">“Wear your glasses back.”</p><p align="left">Agatha smirked as she looked into Rio's eyes. She lifted her thumb up and brushed Rio’s bottom lip with the tip of it. </p><p align="left">“Is that why you're distracted? The glasses? <em>Really</em>?”</p><p align="left">“Yes.” Rio whispered.</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled as she continued moving her thumb on Rio's soft lip, her eyes locked on her face.</p><p align="left">Their hands touched, but Agatha made no move to put the glasses back. “See? You're almost drooling over them. I shouldn't put them back.”</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed her moan. She wouldn't give up this easily, even if she was on the edge of kneeling. </p><p align="left">Rio's other hand moved and took the glasses from Agatha’s hold. She lifted them up and put them on Agatha by herself.</p><p align="left">“Oh, god,” Rio moaned, unable to hold it any longer. It was a sight worthy of moaning and kneeling and worshipping.</p><p align="left">“Seriously?”</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her hand and placed it on the back of Agatha’s head and pulled her forward. Their mouths connected in a soft kiss that tasted like the sweetness of that tangerine segment. But Rio immediately deepened it, tilting her head slightly to the side, sharing the bitterness of their morning coffee as their tongues tangled and sucked.</p><p align="left">Agatha moved the laptop from her lap and placed it on the nightstand without breaking the kiss. One of Rio’s hands pulled Agatha closer and closer—even though there wasn't any <em>closer</em>. Her other hand was softly clenching the rest of the tangerine.</p><p align="left">Once Agatha’s lap was empty, Rio straddled her. She sat on her thighs, making sure she didn't hit her knee as the kiss grew hungrier, more desperate.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s hands rested on Rio’s hips, while Rio’s free hand moved deliberately, up and down across the exposed skin of Agatha’s cleavage.</p><p align="left">She lowered her hand down and opened the loose tie of the rope belt. Once it was undone, her hand moved again, palming the soft, exposed skin. Feeling its softness against her touch. Rio pulled back for a gasp of air, then she kissed Agatha again a second later.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her body up and her hand moved the silky fabric aside, letting it hang on Agatha’s shoulders—baring her front entirely.</p><p align="left">Rio broke the kiss after a few seconds. Before she could drop her gaze to look down at Agatha’s body, Agatha bit her bottom lip slightly and pulled her back into another kiss. Her short nails were digging deeper into Rio’s hips. Rio moaned, and Agatha swallowed the sound, letting it vibrate between both of their mouths. </p><p align="left">The way Agatha’s glasses bumped into her forehead fueled Rio’s body even more, it was maddening. </p><p align="left">They pulled back again, gasping for air to fill their lungs. Rio’s eyes drifted down, gazing at Agatha’s chest, her abdomen, her navel, her waist.</p><p align="left">She started palming one of Agatha’s breasts while her other hand squeezed the tangerine onto the other, making its juice drip onto her rosy, hard nipple.</p><p align="left">“What are you doing?… it'll be sticky later.” Agatha looked down at Rio as she licked her lips. She was breathless, still catching her breaths, but still smirking knowingly.</p><p align="left">“And is that a problem?” Rioasked with a raised eyebrow befored she leaned in and closed her mouth around the nipple. Sucking and tasting.</p><p align="left">One of Agatha’s hands flew to the back of Rio’s head, pushing her forward.“<em>No,</em>” she breathed out.</p><p align="left">Rio kept sucking and licking, running the full length of her tongue across Agatha’s breast, as she rolled the other nipple with her thumb and index finger.</p><p align="left">She moved her head up after biting the the skin slightly, making Agatha whimper faintly.</p><p align="left">Rio looked up at Agatha. The way her eyes were framed with those glasses made Rio drip down every time she looked at them as hot waves kept rushing through her entire body, settling in her stomach and between her thighs.</p><p align="left">She squeezed the rest of the fruit, letting the juice drip from Agatha’s collarbones. A few drops slipped lower, resting on the right side of Agatha’s upper abdomen, leaving a soft yellowish trail on her pale skin.</p><p align="left">Rio’s tongue licked from Agatha’s collarbone down to where those drops rested, tracing their path, then repeated it again. The sound of her tongue gliding along the wet trail of saliva mixed with sweet juice and skin was loud in their ears, given how close they were.</p><p align="left">Her hand, now sticky with fruit, reached out to place the limp segments back on the tray. Rio licked Agatha's skin once more, then she looked up at Agatha's chest. It was rising and falling heavie, her skin was slightly pink and glistening.</p><p align="left">Rio stared at Agatha for a few long seconds, not doing anything, just... looking and appreciating the holy sight in front of her. Until Agatha broke the silence.</p><p align="left">“Hmm?” She hummed, adjusting her glasses with her middle finger.</p><p align="left"><em>God, she was doing it on purpose. </em></p><p align="left">“You won't finish what you started?” Agatha said with a low tone and a knowing smirk.</p><p align="left">Her hand slipped under Rio’s t-shirt, and Rio felt her composure slipping. Agatha cupped both of Rio’s breasts and Rio just looked at her. When Agatha touched both of her nipples and started rolling them between her fingers, Rio started grinding instinctively on Agatha’s thigh, her hips were jerking forward, seeking the fastest friction.</p><p align="left">“You look so beautiful like this.” Agatha pulled a nipple, making Rio moan.</p><p align="left">“Come on, baby. Put your juicy fingers in my mouth. <em>Don't hesitate.</em>” </p><p align="left">Rio looked at her, swallowing down her sounds while processing the command in her head. After a few seconds she moved her hand up and pushed three of her fingers into Agatha’s awaiting mouth.</p><p align="left">Agatha hummed in approval immediately as she started sucking on them, tasting their sweet flavor.</p><p align="left">Then one of her hands left Rio’s breast and she moved it up, wrapping it around Rio’s wrist, pumping Rio’s fingers in and out of her mouth.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck</em>…” Rio breathlessly moaned as she grinded again on Agatha’s thigh, and Agatha nodded in encouragement to go on as she pinched her nipple. So Rio started rubbing her cunt on the length of Agatha’s thigh, she felt the fabric of her underwear sticking into her folds from how <em>drenched</em> she was.</p><p align="left">Feeling her fingers inside Agatha’s mouth, being sucked on like that, being used like that—<em>god</em>, it felt heavenly.</p><p align="left">Agatha continued sucking. The sound of her mouth taking Rio’s fingers in and out was making Rio dizzy, and so goddamn desperate to be taken. To be consumed.</p><p align="left">Agatha took Rio’s fingers out of her mouth as her other hand left Rio’s breast.</p><p align="left">“Take your clothes off,” Agatha said, but Rio felt something running into her, electric and fiery, as Agatha’s touches left her body.</p><p align="left">Rio’s half-lidded eyes widened and she stopped the movement of her hips at the same second.</p><p align="left">Her saliva-coated fingers started moving on Agatha’s clothed cunt. She moved them on her slit from the limited space she had from how Agatha’s legs were separated slightly. She moved her middle finger on it, making the fabric almost get pushed <em>into</em> Agatha’s leaking, heat-raditing entrance alongside with the tip of her middle finger.</p><p align="left">“Rio…”</p><p align="left">“Hmm?” Rio hummed without even looking at Agatha, her eyes were busy focusing down.</p><p align="left">Agatha exhaled through her nose as Rio’s finger continued moving on her slit over the drenched fabric, pushing it in slightly. She held the crotch of the thong with two of her fingers, making it a thin line of drenched fabric, exposing the dark, short curls of hair on the sides. Then she started moving the line of fabric up and down Agatha’s slit, making sure it hit her clit every time. </p><p align="left">Rio looked back up at Agatha and her heart started beating rapidly inside her chest, to see that Agatha—despite the way she was breathing heavily, her chest was red, her eyes were half-lidded, her cunt dripping constantly, she was clearly affected by it all—despite all that, she was only looking at Rio with an unreadable look Rio couldn't quite fathom.</p><p align="left">Rio’s heart dropped into her stomach, as her fingers stilled.</p><p align="left">Did she do something wrong? God, did she do something she wasn't supposed to do? Was it too much? Did she drift away? Why was Agatha looking at her like this?</p><p align="left">“You know you can still do that when your clothes are off.” Agatha said as her glasses almost slipped down, and she adjusted them back with both of her ring and middle finger. Rio looked at her. She understood what was being said, yes, and that was why she peeled her t-shirt off immediately. But why was she panicking right now?</p><p align="left">Rio sat down on the bed and before she could continue what she was doing or ask further questions to herself—</p><p align="left">“Come here,” Agatha said as she offered her hand to Rio, and Rio took it.</p><p align="left">Agatha tapped on her thighs after adjusting her position against the headboard, asking Rio to sit.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her for a second, hesitating as if she wasn't sitting there a second ago. Yeah, she'd never had panic symptoms in the middle of a situation like this before. She didn't know what to do.</p><p align="left">God, she really ruins everything.</p><p align="left">After swallowing her thoughts down, Rio obliged.</p><p align="left">Agatha intertwined their fingers together once Rio sat back down. Despite the fact she was sitting there, on Agatha’s thighs, she felt herself afar. </p><p align="left">Agatha took her glasses off and their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">And the moment Rio looked <em>directly</em> into Agatha’s blue eyes, she realized she wasn't far away, she, in fact, was close. <em>Too</em> close…</p><p align="left">“What was that look?” Agatha asked as the back of her hand started stroking Rio’s cheek softly.</p><p align="left">“What look? No, I'm sorry, I just…” Rio said as her eyes drifted to look across Agatha's face. Every feature except her blue eyes.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s eyes softened and the smirk on her face from earlier was nowhere to be found.</p><p align="left">“Can you just look at me?” Agatha asked with a soft tone. “Look at me, Rio.” She squeezed Rio's hand gently.</p><p align="left">Rio took a few seconds before her eyes met Agatha's again as Agatha’s hands rested on her hips.</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't make any other move, they just sat there, looking into each other’s eyes. Searching and hoping to find.</p><p align="left">At that moment, it was the only time Rio felt herself exposed in front of Agatha, and it wasn't pleasant. It was quiet in the loudest way.</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed down a sob, because why on earth was she feeling like this? Did she do something wrong? She couldn't afford mistakes. Not at that moment. Not with Agatha.</p><p align="left">“Look…” Agatha broke the silence. “If there's something I don't want, I will tell you.” The back of Agatha’s hand started moving higher, stroking the soft skin of Rio’s waist. “You don't need to overthink everything you do for me, Rio. I want this. I <em>need</em> it.” Up on the side of her breast . “And trust me, if there's anything wrong—absolutely anything I will tell you,” she said as her hand lingered a beat too long on Rio’s heart, feeling her unsteady and loud heartbeat in her hold. “I’m not trying to analyze you...” her hand started caressing Rio's collarbones. “But <em>please</em>, Rio. Can you try to stop thinking that everything you do is wrong and a mistake? Because everything you do is crafted gently. Everything you say is measured bewitchingly. And I want it all, Rio. The good and the bad. Show it all to me. Give it all to me. I will take it as long as you're willing to give it.” Agatha 's voice dropped lower. “Willing to give it to <em>me</em>.”</p><p align="left">Her hand rested on the back of Rio’s neck, brushing the small hairs there. Then she lifted it up and started stroking Rio’s cheek with the back of her hand again.</p><p align="left">Rio’s eyes were fixed on Agatha’s. She was looking at how her pupils dilated every time she said Rio’s name out loud. Rio noticed that, and it made her heart tighten in her chest every time.</p><p align="left">Rio’s breath got trapped in her throat. She couldn't inhale properly. She squeezed Agatha’s hand absentmindedly, the one that was intertwining with hers. Not saying a word, because... could she afford being vulnerable?</p><p align="left">“What if... what I have to give is so little and not enough?” Rio asked. Her tone was sharp and clear, but the tears started falling down from her eyes, fast, hot and transparent. Soaking her face.</p><p align="left">Agatha lifted her fingers up and brushed the tears away, and Rio’s hand rested on her wrist.</p><p align="left">“What if I showed you what I've got... then you would realize it's nothing?... I'm—I'm sure I have nothing to offer you, Agatha. What's then?”</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in as her hand rested on the back of Rio’s head. She gently pushed Rio’s head forward, their faces were a few inches apart as their fingers remained intertwined by Rio’s tight hold.</p><p align="left">“I want that little, Rio. I <em>so</em> wretchedly need it.” Agatha leaned closer, her forehead was almost resting on Rio’s.</p><p align="left">Their warm breaths were landing on each other’s skin.</p><p align="left">“So… if you want me right now? Then take me, Rio. I <em>want</em> you to take me.” Agatha whispered the words close to Rio’s mouth as the tears continued to fall down. </p><p align="left">And there sat Rio on Agatha’s lap, amongst her cries and Agatha’s whispers, while feeling her heart pounding in her chest.</p><p align="left">Rio put her hand on the back of Agatha’s neck.</p><p align="left">“<em>I want you</em>.” The words were so faint and they barely left her mouth.</p><p align="left">Rio pulled Agatha in for a kiss—a kiss that was so tender. So mellow, with a hint of salt from Rio’s tears that managed to fall on her lips earlier.</p><p align="left">She needed the kiss to land right, because if her mouth couldn't form the words, maybe it could kiss them and make Agatha feel them.</p><p align="left">Rio slightly pulled back and looked into Agatha’s eyes. All the softness of the world was lying in her gaze.</p><p align="left">She took Agatha’s other hand and intertwined their fingers together.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at their hands on both sides, then she looked up.</p><p align="left">“What if I hurt you?”</p><p align="left">“You won't.”</p><p align="left">As their fingers remained intertwined, Rio suddenly felt the silver around her thumb. <em>Agatha’s ring</em>—the one she didn't take off because she didn't even feel it there. But at that moment, she was aware of its weight wrapping around her finger. </p><p align="left">She pulled her hand gently, took the ring off and looked at it, then she put it on Agatha’s thumb. Her eyes drifted back to Agatha's eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio took both of Agatha’s hands and put them on her hips, then she pulled the remains of the fabric off Agatha’s shoulders and Agatha leaned back against the headboard.</p><p align="left">Rio leaned in, her mouth was a breath away from Agatha’s.</p><p align="left">“<em>Open for me then. If you want me to take you.</em>”</p><p align="left">Agatha licked her lips as her gaze kept drifting between Rio’s mouth and her eyes. </p><p align="left">Rio got off the bed and took her shorts and underwear off, then she took the breakfast away from the bed, putting the tray on the nearest surface.</p><p align="left">She got in bed again, leaned in and kissed Agatha as she sat on her heels between her legs.</p><p align="left">“How do you want me, Rio?”</p><p align="left">“In the way you want me to take you.”</p><p align="left">Rio leaned in and kissed Agatha again as her hand started palming Agatha’s cunt through the very thin line of drenched fabric. Agatha moaned into her mouth when she felt Rio pulling the fabric aside, and two of her fingers entered her with ease. Rio broke the kiss as she took her fingers out and spread the fluids on agatha’s slit. Up and down.</p><p align="left">“I want all of you, and I... I feel selfish for wanting you this much. For craving you this much.”</p><p align="left">Rio maintained the slow movements of her fingers, running them up and down, making sure she hit Agatha’s clit every time. Then she pushed her fingers inside again and started thrusting them deliberately.</p><p align="left">She wasn't aiming at making this an agony to Agatha, she just wanted to feel her. Feel the warmth of her walls. The way her tight hole swallowed Rio’s fingers. The way Agatha’s body shivered noticeably. Her hands struggled to stay still. Agatha wanted to touch Rio and even guide her, but at the same time, she was offering herself and wanted Rio to consume her. </p><p align="left">Agatha opened her mouth, about to say something, but it got replaced by a high-pitched moan when Rio started thrusting faster, and even faster.</p><p align="left">“Can you… <em>Fuck</em>…you feel good. So good, baby… But let me… <em>god</em>...” Agatha moaned each syllable breathlessly.</p><p align="left">Rio took Agatha’s hand and guided it to her clit as she continued thrusting and Agatha started rubbing her clit. </p><p align="left">“No, tap on it. And tell me what do you want, I'll get it.”</p><p align="left">Agatha licked her lips as she looked at Rio.</p><p align="left">Her eyes were half-lidded and full of lust. As the movement of Rio and her own fingers continued, Agatha moved her other hand up and held her hair in a ponytail—holding on to it for dear life. </p><p align="left">Rio put her other hand on the shin of Agatha’s non-injured leg and bent it up.</p><p align="left">“Hmm?” Rio hummed in question as she added a third finger. </p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck, Rio… my phone, jesus. I should get this call… fuck me!</em>”</p><p align="left">Only then did Rio realize that the buzzing sound wasn't in her head.</p><p align="left">She smirked as she leaned in and kissed Agatha’s bottom lip.</p><p align="left">“Is it something important?” She took Agatha’s hand away and her middle finger replaced it on her throbbing clit.</p><p align="left">“<em>Yes.</em>” Agatha whimpered.</p><p align="left">Rio continued thrusting as she started rubbing, but she slowed her pace.</p><p align="left">“Take it then… or cum for me right now.” </p><p align="left">Both of Agatha’s hands took hold of Rio’s hair, pulling it up roughly. She pulled Rio’s head in and kissed her, it was messy and desperate.</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled back, her forehead was resting on Rio’s as she exhaled heavy breaths through her nose, and she kept pushing Rio’s head forward. Toward her.</p><p align="left">“Let me cum and stop doing that.” She said through gritted teeth. Her orgasm was resting on the edges and it needed to get pushed.</p><p align="left">“Doing what?”</p><p align="left">“Fuck, Rio. Just let me cum!”</p><p align="left">“Can you do better than that?”</p><p align="left">The phone probably buzzed for the fifth time.</p><p align="left">“<em>Please.</em>”</p><p align="left">God, even pleading in her voice was a fucking symphony.</p><p align="left">Rio started thrusting her three fingers faster into Agatha, and it wasn't only a few seconds later that her body tensed, her walls clenched around Rio’s fingers, and her eyes rolled back as her orgasm tore through her.</p><p align="left">She cried out, and Rio kept fucking her through it.</p><p align="left">Rio waited a few seconds, then she took her fingers out and sucked them clean. She leaned in and kissed Agatha. Before Agatha could even protest, Rio took hold of both of her shins and made her slide down into the bed, making only her upper body lie on it, and she made sure that Agatha's head landed on the pillows.</p><p align="left">She took both of Agatha’s legs and put them on her shoulders, making sure not to hurt the injured knee. As she remained sitting on her heels, making Agatha’s lower body lifted up for her. Her cunt waiting Rio to devour it.</p><p align="left">“<em>Rio</em>…” Agatha called, her voice was soft and pleading.</p><p align="left">“Are you comfortable?” Rio asked from between Agatha's legs.</p><p align="left">“Yes. Goddamn it, go on.” </p><p align="left">Rio lowered her mouth and started sucking, entering her tongue into Agatha’s leaking entrance while listening to her breathy curses and heavy moans.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s body started trembling immediately, so Rio tightened her hold on her legs and pushed her body forward, burying her head in Agatha’s cunt as she started eating her out.</p><p align="left">As she got closer to her orgasm, Agatha’s hips started jerking up, making Rio’s mouth change its direction every time. So Rio tightened her hold and lifted Agatha’s body higher, making only her head rest on the pillows.</p><p align="left">Rio stretched her upper body up, leaned her head down, and wrapped her lips around the throbbing clit. She slighr bit the bundle of nerves, then started sucking it again.</p><p align="left">Agatha cried out, her body started shuddering, her hips were jerking up as she lifted her hands up to reach for Rio.</p><p align="left">But Rio continued what she was doing. She took Agatha’s whole cunt into her mouth.</p><p align="left">A few seconds passed and Agatha’s body crashed. Her orgasm was eruptive and hot. She tried to put her hips down, but Rio was keeping her up with her hold on her legs. And she kept sucking, until Agatha came for the third time and the muscles in her legs tensed more than any time before—her thighs were hard as rocks.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her head up but Agatha’s body continued trembling. She gently took Agatha’s legs off her shoulders and put them on the bed one after the other.</p><p align="left">Even after putting them down, Agatha’s hips were still jerking up, as her chest was red and heaving. </p><p align="left">Rio put her palm under Agatha’s body and her other one rested on her hip. She pushed her down gently, until she felt Agatha’s back lying on her palm.</p><p align="left">Then she moved up and adjusted the pillows under her head. And she felt Agatha’s eyes following every movement.</p><p align="left">Rio dropped the duvet over Agatha’s body as it continued to shiver slightly from the sudden rush of coldness in her system.</p><p align="left">She leaned in and kissed Agatha’s chin, her lips, her nose, her cheeks, between her eyebrows, her forehead, her sweaty hair and Rio rested her face there.</p><p align="left">“Maybe you should pick up that one,” Rio said with a chuckle after the phone buzzed for… who was counting?</p><p align="left">“You're wild.” Agatha said with a low tone as she closed her eyes.</p><p align="left">“I could be.” She kissed Agatha’s scalp again. “Want me to run a bath for you?” </p><p align="left">“No, just lie beside me.”</p><p align="left">And Rio did.</p><hr/><p align="left">They lay there, Rio was staring at the ceiling as she felt heat radiating from Agatha’s body beside her, thinking about the fact that she was lying beside Agatha and she wasn't freaking out. </p><p align="left">It felt… normal. Not the standard definition of normality. Not in the sense that this was typical and expected and empty of new emotions. It was normal in the sense of making Rio’s entire body dance, and she wasn't minding it in the slightest or scared of it—and even not being scared of it didn't feel scary. It felt... domestic and serene.</p><p align="left">Like, this was it. This was what she wanted—Agatha by her side.</p><p align="left">Apparently, Agatha had fallen asleep, so Rio removed the covers off her body, got out of bed and stood on her feet, stretching her arms up.</p><p align="left">“Where are you going?”</p><p align="left">Rio turned her head back to look at her.</p><p align="left">“Thought you were sleeping.”</p><p align="left">“Why are you whispering?”</p><p align="left">Rio cleared her throat. “I thought you were asleep.”</p><p align="left">“Mhm.” Agatha sat against the headboard, not bothering to lift the covers up her body. She stretched her arms up, and Rio was just standing there, dumbstruck, looking at her. </p><p align="left">“I'm gonna take a shower, and you can join me only if you promise you won't make me late because I have an important call that I should’ve been done with two hours ago.” </p><p align="left">Rio licked her lips. “I can't promise anything.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, then just find something else to do until I finish, yeah?”</p><p align="left">“That's so unfair.”</p><p align="left">“Rio, can you behave for half an hour or not?”</p><p align="left">“Let's say... not, what are the consequences?” She poked her cheeks with the tip of her tongue.</p><p align="left">Agatha put a few strands of hair behind her ears, then she got out of bed, walking toward Rio, completely bare. Looking glorious. Looking godly and so out of reach.</p><p align="left">Because everything Agatha did seemed to be sublime—every simple act and gesture.</p><p align="left">The way her hip bones looked when she swayed them slightly as she walked? God, that was Rio's place of worship. That wa what Rio wanted to look at while she was kneeling.</p><p align="left">Rio felt her mouth water, craving who was approaching her. Because she could not get enough of Agatha. Rio wanted to give what she had to Agatha, and she <em>yearned</em> to take what Agatha had to offer her. All of it.</p><p align="left">Agatha stood in front of her, and Rio lifted her hands up to rest them on Agatha’s hips, but Agatha was quick to stop the act by taking both of Rio’s hands and held them by their sides.</p><p align="left">“You don't want to know the consequences, so behave.”</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and kissed Rio’s lips. Just a soft peck.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her when they slightly pulled back.</p><p align="left">“Like, you would... punish me?” Rio asked, the urge to test the limits flooded her.</p><p align="left">Agatha slid her leg with ease between Rio’s, and Rio moaned the same moment it happened.</p><p align="left">“Behave.” Agatha's sultry voice was laced with so much amusement and promising.</p><p align="left">Rio nodded eagerly. She wanted to behave for Agatha, <em>god</em>, how she wanted to satisfy her.</p><p align="left">Agatha loosened her tight hold on Rio’s hands, then she flicked Rio's exposed nipple. The sudden mixed rush of pleasure made Rio moan, and she jerked her hips forward, making Agatha’s thigh add some stimulation on her clit. </p><p align="left">“Good, now go to the kitchen and eat something, don't starve yourself.”</p><p align="left">“Okay.”</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and crashed their lips together— which made her knee get pushed in even more, adding more pressure on Rio’s cunt as her other hand grabbed her ass. Rio’s body twitched, and she leaned in, trying to grind on Agatha’s thigh muscle, to chase that fraction again on her clit.</p><p align="left">But Agatha pulled back, landed a light slap on Rio’s ass, then she walked away. Put her robe on and headed to the bathroom.</p><p align="left">Rio stood there for a few, long seconds, looking at nothing in particular as she continued running her fingers on her lips in disbelief. In heat and arousal.</p><p align="left">She needed to change that goddamn underwear. But she didn't even come here in underwear in the first place.</p><p align="left">So Rio walked around the room, found her t-shirt and put it on. She took the tray of food next and stepped out of the room, hearing a faint sound of running water through the hallway.</p><p align="left">Rio sat on the couch after eating the breakfast that she was supposed to eat, chugged down her cold coffee, washed the dishes, and picked a book to read from Agatha’s library in the living room.</p><p align="left">Rio opened the book and looked at the first page. There was a short note written with a pencil in French on the corner of the page, which Rio knew was Agatha’s handwriting, but she couldn't read what it was.</p><p align="left">She read a few pages of the book. When she flicked to the next page, a few scraps of paper fell into her lap.</p><p align="left">Pencil sketches of a woman that <em>had</em> to be Wanda.</p><p align="left">Rio knew it from the hair cut and not something else.</p><p align="left">One of them was the redhead wearing a skirt and a sweater, while the other was a sketch of her face and body with great details—from her head down to her pubic bone—and the rest remained undrawn. The third one was just a ghost of a body, no details or features.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at the sketch of Wanda’s naked body, not to admire the body but to admire the work. Admire the way Agatha’s eyes captured the details and how her hands drew them.</p><p align="left">Aside from her appreciation of Agatha's great talent, Rio felt herself burn inside. The fact that Agatha’s eyes and hands had looked <em>and</em> touched <em>and</em> appreciated <em>and</em> drawn a body other than hers made her feel sick.</p><p align="left">Even if she was aware that she didn't know Agatha for a long time, her body still reacted to the nausea that formed in her stomach. Her entire body got diseased with jealousy, one she wasn't fond of, and the worst of it all—Rio didn't know how to deal with it.</p><p align="left">She turned the paper around, and there was something written there, a long note written in French.</p><p align="left">Rio tried her best to read it, to understand what was written there. But the only thing she was able to understand was the ‘<em>Je suis</em>’ that was written three times in different places. So she picked the other piece of paper and turned it around.</p><p><em>We could slip away, wouldn't that be better?</em><br/><em>Me with nothing to say, and you in your autumn sweater.</em></p><p align="left">Rio just kept looking at the sketches, unaware of Agatha’s arrival.</p><p align="left">“Of <em>all</em> the books, you picked <em>The Bell Jar</em>?” Agatha said with a smirk, as she pointed at the book beside Rio with her eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio looked up at her and Agatha stepped forward.</p><p align="left">“What's wrong?”</p><p align="left">Rio put the papers back in their place and smiled back at Agatha. “Nothing.”</p><p align="left">Agatha stood beside her, leaned down and picked the book up and opened it.</p><p align="left">“Those are… they're old.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, I know,” Rio said, trying to sound as optimistic as possible even if she wasn't that composed.</p><p align="left">Agatha put the book down, took Rio’s hand in hers, then she walked to be in front of her. </p><p align="left">She cupped Rio’s face with her other hand, brushing her thumb on her skin gently while her other thumb was brushing Rio’s knuckle.</p><p align="left">Agatha was looking down at Rio’s face, while Rio looked up at her—her legs widened slightly which made a space for Agatha to step forward and stand between them.</p><p align="left">“They're old. Three years ago, even older.” Agatha’s voice was incredibly soft and reassuring.</p><p align="left">Rio nodded. “I know they're old,” she said as a soft smile found its way to her lips.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and kissed her forehead.</p><p align="left">Then their eyes connected when she pulled back slightly. She lifted both of her hands up and cupped Rio’s face. </p><p align="left">Her touches were so tender, her eyes were so soft, making Rio’s heart sing in her chest—and her silence was so comforting. It was peaceful and understanding.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't know if her emotions were so obvious and easy to read or if Agatha was <em>that</em> good at knowing her. Knowing what she was feeling.</p><p align="left">If she could sense Rio’s distress that fast, could she also sense how helpless Rio was for her? Could she hear how her heart pounded in her chest every time she got close to her? Every time she did the simplest things ever? If she was able to notice the way Rio’s breath got unstable more than once, did she notice it every time? Did she notice it when Rio kissed her, touched her or even just inhaled her scent?</p><p align="left">Rio’s hands were moving up and down Agatha’s legs as Agatha continued brushing her thumbs soothingly on Rio’s skin, looking into her eyes. <em>Seeing</em> her.</p><p align="left">Rio felt her eyes water, because, all that softness… It was overwhelming. Rio wasn't used to that. To be treated like this—held and touched gently. Rio knew the rough side of it, the loud and messy. She spent her whole life over-explaining herself and yet remained misunderstood, then Agatha came and showed her that she could see her and hear her without even voicing it out loud. Showing her that she deserved the tender side of it. She deserved an explanation to comfort her. And showed her emotions weren't too much—because Agatha coue feel them just as well as her.</p><p align="left">Rio blinked the tears away, then she closed her eyes briefly as she inhaled a deep breath. It smelled like Agatha’s perfume, the one she put on her pulse points. </p><p align="left">Rio licked her lips as she opened her eyes again. “Did you finish your work?” Her hands continued moving up and down the side length of Agatha’s legs. </p><p align="left">Agatha smiled as her fingers moved up to trace the bridge of Rio’s nose. “Yes.”</p><p align="left">Rio smiled back. That toothy bright smile of hers.</p><p align="left">“And did you wrap your knee back?” Both of her hands started moving up and down the sides of the injured leg.</p><p align="left">“Not yet.”</p><p align="left">Agatha’s hands rested on the back of Rio’s neck, and both of her thumbs stretched to their lengths, resting on both sides of Rio's neck.</p><p align="left">Agatha lifted Rio’s head up and looked down at her. Rio felt herself floating in her headspace as her hands stopped moving and stilled on the back of Agatha’s thigh.</p><p align="left">Rio’s eyes were half-lidded and her mouth was slightly parted as Agatha continued drawing invisible circles on Rio’s pulse point with her thumb.</p><p align="left">“You're <em>so beautiful,</em>” Agatha whispered, and Rio felt her heart being ripped out from her chest.</p><p align="left">Agatha had called her beautiful several times before, but this time, Rio felt it in her bones.</p><p align="left">To be called beautiful from a goddess like her. It was a lot to carry and feel.</p><p align="left">“<em>You're</em> so beautiful,” Rio whispered back.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned down and gently kissed her parted lips.</p><hr/><p align="left">A few hours passed. They tangled on the couch, embraced by the heat of their bodies and the soft whispers. Rio walked around the living room looking here and there while she felt Agatha’s eyes following her. Then she took care of Agatha’s leg just like the night before. Then she moved a few pieces of furniture and changed their places because she didn't want Agatha to do it herself. Even though Agatha protested and tried to make her sit down in <em>so</em> many different ways, Rio didn't.</p><p align="left">She kissed Agatha when she opened her mouth to protest or she just grinned like an idiot and did what she wanted to do.</p><p align="left">Two times, she moved the wrong stuff on purpose so Agatha would call her and tell her which one was the right one.</p><p align="left">By the time she finished, Agatha was in the kitchen, cooking them lunch. Rio didn't hesitate this time to wrap her arms around Agatha’s waist and rest her head on her shoulder. She didn't hesitate to inhale her deeply and fill her senses with Agatha’s scent. She didn't hesitate to kiss her skin or roll Agatha’s sleeve up when it fell down two times.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't hesitate not because she was used to it, but because Agatha made it feel natural. As if Agatha was pulling Rio in to act on her desires. Encouraging her.</p><p align="left">And Rio certainly felt that pull before, but she didn't act upon it. She didn't dare to.</p><p align="left">Rio whispered near Agatha’s ear something that landed the wrong way.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s hands stilled. She turned around, pinned Rio on the counter by the hips, and pushed her thigh between Rio’s as she started talking about the most casual things. Rio moaned an involuntary moan, she was already <em>so</em> aroused since the morning, that the slightest bit of stimulation made her body shiver.</p><p align="left">So Agatha kept adding more pressure, kept talking, as Rio buried her face in Agatha’s shoulder despite the fact that Agatha demanded her attention. Rio couldn't.</p><p align="left">While the potatoes on the stove were boiling next to them, Rio was boiling on the edge.</p><p align="left">She moaned a high-pitched moan into Agatha’s shoulder, as she put both of her hands on her back, holding on Agatha for dear life. But Agatha—the goddamn wicked, woman that she was—she pulled her leg away while Rio kept her head buried there.</p><p align="left">God, how she loved to deny her.</p><p align="left">Rio stood there panting, aroused, denied and dripping. </p><p align="left">But the rawest need of them all, was the fact that Rio wanted this. She wanted both—to be touched and denied. She wanted <em>whatever</em> Agatha was willing to offer her.</p><p align="left">A few long seconds passed, and she had to ask Agatha to give her some new clothes or just show her where to gon</p><p align="left">She tried to act so casual about asking it, but the way Agatha smirked as she continued cutting the vegetables? That woman was so goddamn tormentous.</p><p align="left">Agatha put the knife down, turned around and moved to the sink. She washed her hands then dried them as she just kept looking at Rio.</p><p align="left">“Why?” Agatha asked, trying to sound ignorant about it. Rio saw the way Agatha's pupils dilated when she pushed her knee and felt how soaked Rio was through the layers of fabric. So she knew damn well why Rio wanted to change.</p><p align="left">“What do you mean why?”</p><p align="left">“I think you look beautiful in those.” Agatha stepped forward and Rio felt her heart drop down into her stomach. If Agatha tried to edge her again, she'd lose it all.</p><p align="left">“Yes, I know…”</p><p align="left">Agatha stretched her hand out, acting like she wanted to grab something from beside Rio. So Rio felt threatened immediately and pulled her legs together.</p><p align="left">“Fuck, I need to change my underwear, Agatha. Why are you doing this?”</p><p align="left">“What did I do now?” Agatha said with a chuckle as she grabbed a pot and put it down again.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her. “Can you please just give me some clothes?” she tried again, and Agatha seemed like she appreciated that.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in, facing Rio. “If you want me to touch you right now, just say it and I will do it.” Her gaze drifted to look at Rio’s lips. “Do you?” Her eyes drifted up again. Her pupils were dilated and hungry. “I can smell how fucking soaked you are from here, Rio…” She leaned closer, making Rio move back, her hands were grabbing the counter as her spine hit it. “So why don't you ask for it? Hmm?”</p><p align="left">“I—” Rio tried.</p><p align="left">She'd jump on that goddamn counter if she had the space.</p><p align="left">“You're what?” Agatha looked down at Rio’s parted lips that she kept licking to wet them, then Agatha’s gaze drifted lower, to Rio’s heaving chest. “Go upstairs and pick what you want to wear, Rio.” Her thumb brushed Rio’s bottom lip for less than a moment then she pulled away. Giving Rio the space to breathe.</p><p align="left">Rio breathed in and out as she kept looking at Agatha. It was there on the tip of her tongue, the question, the reason, all of it. But she swallowed them down. No alcohol in her system to make her voice what she wanted at that moment. So she just went upstairs, picked the clothes, and headed to take a quick shower to cool her body down.</p><p align="left">She put the shirt on—the oversized, earthy-green, button–up shirt that she saw Agatha wearing at Lilia’s house. Rio picked it up immediately the moment she glanced at it—it smelled like Agatha, a piece of clothes that was so full of her. So Rio just stood there in the bathroom, her short hair was wet, water was dripping down from her body while she grabbed the shirt by its collar and inhaled it like an addict.</p><p align="left">Then she turned around to the mirror and stared at all the marks Agatha had left on her skin last night.</p><p align="left">She traced them with her fingers through the open buttons of the shirt. And as she did, she remembered the way she pleaded and begged Agatha to take her the night before, in the middle of their date.</p><p align="left">How driven she was. How she pumped into a woman’s shoulder just so she could get into the restroom as fast as possible. And how Agatha fucked her—she didn't just fuck her, Agatha took care of her after she asked, even if Agatha doubted it, considering the place they were in and the state Rio was in.</p><p align="left">“<em>I need you. So please just give me what I want.</em>”</p><p align="left">And Agatha didn't hesitate a second after that.</p><p align="left">Rio looked away from her reflection. She took her necklace, and put it back. She whipped her hair back and forth for a few seconds then she stepped out.</p><p align="left">Rio went downstairs. Agatha was looking at something on her phone, propping her head on her arm on the counter. Her body was slightly stretched, her back arched—and <em>god</em> how her butt looked like at that moment.</p><p align="left">That shower Rio used to cool down? It absolutely didn't work. Her body started heating up again, making the drops of water on her body evaporate.</p><p align="left">“Hey,” Rio said with a low voice, unintended.</p><p align="left">Agatha adjusted her posture as she looked at Rio.</p><p align="left">She drifted her eyes all over Rio's body. From from head to toes, leaving nothing not stared at.</p><p align="left">“Couldn't really find where the shorts are,” Rio admitted as she stepped forward, looking down at the shirt that was falling and covering half of her thighs and it was clinging to her wet body. </p><p align="left">“They're in the…”</p><p align="left">“I think it looks good like this,” Rio interrupted with a smirk.</p><p align="left">Agatha stood in silence for a second, then she found her voice back.</p><p align="left">“It does look good like this. <em>You</em> look good.” Agatha licked her lips. She was basically drooling as her eyes kept drifting up to Rio’s cleavage. </p><hr/><p align="left">They sat down, facing each other.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s gaze was mostly on Rio. Rio would lift her eyes up only to see her already looking. Rio smiled, and Agatha would smile too. She searched Rio’s face with her eyes every time Rio talked. Her eyes landed on her mouth as she spoke, then she'd lift them up and lock them on Rio's. Both of them would sit still when their eyes connected, as if the whole world froze around them while they melted in their seats, across from one another.</p><p align="left">Rio felt herself being filled up with happiness every single time Agatha laughed or reacted to something with a sound. And she did that a lot, which meant that Rio was full of happiness while sitting across from Agatha. </p><p align="left">Who knew that a good meal was good because of the company? Definitely not Rio.</p><p align="left">“I just know you were a wild kid,” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh</em>, definitely. The worst.”</p><p align="left">“Really?” Rio put her spoon down as she grinned.</p><p align="left">“Really.” Agatha chuckled. “When I was a kid, my mother once told me that rules were invented because of me, and I kinda made that my whole personality for years.”</p><p align="left">Rio chuckled. “Okay, what's the worst thing you've done?” she asked, her voice was laced with great amusement.</p><p align="left">Agatha smirked as she ran the tip of her tongue over her upper lip. “Burned the house down. And... <em>on purpose.</em>”</p><p align="left">“No way! Did someone get hurt? Like, did you get caught or something?”</p><p align="left">Agatha laughed again. “Not really. It was empty—that was the purpose. And Evanora... my mother didn't report on me because she wouldn't be able to handle the shame and the way people would look at her if they knew her daughter did <em>that</em>. But... she did bring it up every time she had an episode of yelling.” Agatha lowered her gaze to her plate. “But I'm not a pyromaniac if that's what you're thinking. It was a once-in-life thing, and that house was suffocating anyway.”</p><p align="left">“Why did you do it?” Rio propped her head on her arm while looking at Agatha’s face, spotting every micro-expression.</p><p align="left">“It was something stupid, I was a… a coward.” </p><p align="left">Rio kept her eyes on her, demanding more. And Agatha remained silent for a few seconds.</p><p align="left">“It was the only way we could live somewhere else. Because… I was fifteen, and got caught with a girl from my school. I got blackmailed for months…” Agatha chuckled awkwardly. “And the worst thing at the time... It wasn't going to a correctional facility or something, it was my mother finding out that I'm a… a lesbian.” She said the last sentence with a gesture of her hand, dismissing the subject as if itcwas nothing. “That bitch would’ve dragged my life into a lower layer of hell at the time.”</p><p align="left">Rio was looking at her, lost in the images she was picturing in her head—teenager Agatha. But she was pulled back from her thoughts when Agatha spoke again.</p><p align="left">“I bet you were a polite-looking troublemaker.”</p><p align="left">Rio blinked as she processed what was being said, then she grinned.</p><p align="left">“More like a rude-looking troublemaker.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? What's the wildest thing teenager Rio has done. Of course... aside from naming her punk band <em>The Scissors</em>?”</p><p align="left">Rio narrowed her eyes as she poked the walls of her cheeks with her tongue. “Well, do you consider fucking your girlfriend in your aunt’s office while she was talking with someone on the door a wild or an average behavior?”</p><p align="left">“You did not! How old were you?” Agatha chuckled in disbelief.</p><p align="left">“Sixteen. And she found out because Alice didn't shut up about it.”</p><p align="left">“Wait, so you and Alice were…”</p><p align="left">“Yes.” Rio laughed. “And my aunt, aunt Teresa—she was my guardian <em>and</em> a therapist. You do the math of it.” Rio was giggling after saying each word as the memories of her rebellious years flooded her.</p><p align="left">After they finished eating, Rio insisted on washing the dishes once again. So Agatha let her, as she sat close by, looking at Rio’s every movement.</p><p align="left">The fact that Agatha hadn't touched Rio in any way since she got out of the shower made Rio’s heart beat in her chest. Agatha only kept looking at her from a distance. Even though her eyes were devouring and her gaze was burning—she didn't do anything. And the restraint Agatha was showing was driving Rio crazy. Even without being touched, she was turned on. She felt herself getting more and more aroused every time she glanced at Agatha. Which was crazy.</p><p align="left">Agatha opened a bottle of wine for them after Rio suggested they have a movie <em>afternoon</em> since they didn't have any other plans for the day and Agatha only nodded with a smile—even though Rio was almost clinging onto her.</p><p align="left">“Why don't you have a TV?”</p><p align="left">“I don't need one.”</p><p align="left">“Oh, you absolutely do. Or we should start having movie afternoons at my place.”</p><p align="left">“Rio,” Agatha chuckled as she shook her head. “This is the first time we do this.”</p><p align="left">“That's not an excuse,” Rio responded as she picked the movie on Agatha’s laptop, <em>Antonia’s Line 1995.</em></p><p align="left">“I once saw you on TV, you know?” She said, looking at the screen in front of her as Agatha placed the wine and the snacks that Rio picked on the coffee table.</p><p align="left">“You saw me? When?” </p><p align="left">Rio lifted her head up and looked at Agatha. “It was some old documentary about artists and... you were in it… it was the day after I saw you at the bar.”</p><p align="left">“I don't remember that. How old was it?”</p><p align="left">“I couldn't tell,” Rio lowered her gaze down, “but you looked beautiful in it.” she lowered her voice as she confessed that.</p><p align="left">They began watching the movie while sitting side by side, but half hour in, Agatha was lying on the couch and the laptop resting on her abdomen, and Rio was clinging to her side while resting her head on Agatha’s chest. </p><p align="left">Then another thirteen minutes passed, after Rio’s second glass of wine, her leg was on Agatha’s, her shirt was lifted up, not caring about it. Rio looked up at Agatha for a few seconds, hoping that Agatha would look down at her, but she didn't. So Rio pouted her lips slightly as she looked down at the screen. </p><p align="left">“I've always wanted to have a tattoo,” Rio said out of nowhere.</p><p align="left">Agatha hummed for her to go on.</p><p align="left">“So… I want you to draw on my body.”</p><p align="left">Agatha looked down at her. “What?”</p><p align="left">Rio remained silent. She was only blinking.</p><p align="left">“You want me to draw on your body?” Agatha narrowed her eyes slightly.</p><p align="left">“Yes.”</p><p align="left">Agatha paused the movie then she lifted Rio’s face up by her chin and their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">“What do you want me to draw?”</p><p align="left">“I don't know. Anything.”</p><p align="left">“Okay.” And she nodded.</p><p align="left">Agatha got up to bring the supplies she needed. Brushes and paints and all. Then she came back and opened the nearby windows.</p><p align="left">She assured Rio three times that the paints were usable on skin and the brushes were new and clean, and she made sure that Rio knew that the paints had a strong smell. She also kept asking if Rio was sure she didn't have any skin problems or allergies and if her body wasn't sensitive to chemicals. And Rio assured her every time that it was totally okay.</p><p align="left">“Turn around,” Agatha said after Rio took off her shirt and remained only in her underwear—which made Agatha’s mouth water constantly, noticeably.</p><p align="left">“No, I want to look at you,” Rio said as she leaned against the couch armrest. “It won't ruin the couch though?”</p><p align="left">“Don't worry about it.”</p><p align="left">Agatha was standing away from Rio. Staring at the body in front of her.</p><p align="left">She stepped forward, brush in hand. </p><p align="left">The other stuff was set on a small table nearby that Agatha dragged from her studio.</p><p align="left">Rio bent one of her knees up, making room for Agatha to sit between her legs. </p><p align="left">Their eyes connected.</p><p align="left">Agatha lifted her hand up and started palming one of Rio's breasts. The shiver that ran through Rio's body felt like an electric wave. It made her tremble immediately, as her half-lidded eyes kept looking up at Agatha.</p><p align="left">Agatha ran the brush on Rio’s skin and she shivered again as she struggled not to jerk her hips up.</p><p align="left">“It tickles,” Rio said, her voice was barely above a whisper.</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled as she repeated the movement of the brush, testing it on Rio’s skin, moving it on the valley between her breasts.</p><p align="left">Rio kept her eyes pinned on Agatha. She was already feeling dizzy. She felt her body heaten up will every passing second.</p><p align="left">Agatha started moving the brush around her nipples, making them erect at the touch and more sensitive.</p><p align="left">One of Agatha’s hands started moving up and down Rio’s body. Starting with her cleavage and resting on her hips. Then she put the brush in her hair bun and started massaging Rio’s body with both hands.</p><p align="left">Rio felt as if Agatha was doing a series of rituals on her body. Praying and blessing. </p><p align="left">“Have you done this before?” Rio whispered.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked up at Rio while holding her hips with both hands as she started drawing invisible circles around the edges of Rio’s navel with her thumbs.</p><p align="left">“No.” She trailed one of her hands to move lower— from Rio’s pelvic bone, down to her shin. Agatha's thumb teased the inside of Rio’s thigh on the way down, making Rio whimper, so Agatha repeated the movement on the way up, and as anticipated, Rio heavily sighed.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked to the side and pulled the small table toward her. Rio kept looking at her as she opened the paints, took the brush from her hair, wet it with alcohol, then she used it to mix blue and purple on the wooden palette. </p><p align="left">She moved the brush gently on Rio’s skin. Starting right under her left breast, and Rio felt herself getting lost in it. In the sensations and Agatha's presence.</p><p align="left">She watched as Agatha repeated the same movements time after time, her fingers were working fast, because, as she explained to Rio, that the paints dry fast. </p><p align="left">Rio felt herself getting used to the feeling of the brush on her skin, but she didn't get used to the way Agatha tried <em>really</em> hard not to place her hand on the wrong place.</p><p align="left">“What are you drawing?”</p><p align="left">Agatha looked up at her. “Bluebells. Saw them in your garden.”</p><p align="left">Rio smiled with gleaming eyes as she bit her bottom lip.</p><p align="left">Who knew that feeling like a canvas would also feel like being worshipped?</p><p align="left">When Agatha changed the color to green, Rio felt the brush starting from her fifth rib down to her pelvis, feeling its gentle brushes as Agatha’s other hand was resting on her other hip.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked so beautiful while she was focused. The way she kept her eyes on the place she was working on. How precise every movement she did and how it landed gently every time. Rio noticed that if Agatha was fully focusing on something, she wouldn't speak unless spoken to. She'd nod with her head, hum, or even offer a look, but the verbal responses were only when Rio asked her something or spoke to her first.</p><p align="left">Agatha moved slightly between Rio’s legs as she leaned in to draw something on Rio’s abdomen.</p><p align="left">She didn't realize her knee was putting pressure on Rio’s cunt until she felt Rio’s body shivering under her touch. She looked up at Rio and saw how dilated her pupils were and how her chest was rising and falling rapidly.</p><p align="left">She moved her knee immediately. “Fuck, I’m sorry.”</p><p align="left">Agatha looked down to see the patch of wetness that was dark on Rio’s underwear as her body continued trembling.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked up at her, “Did you…” </p><p align="left">“Fuck, I’m sorry. Fuck, this is…” Rio covered her face with her hands out of embarrassment.</p><p align="left">Well, she said she'd lose it all, didn't she?</p><p align="left">“Hey. Hey, why are you apologizing?” Agatha asked as she removed Rio’s hands gently and looked into her eyes. </p><p align="left">“I’m gonna wash my hands.” Agatha said. Her eyes were wide and dark.</p><p align="left">Then she leaned in and captured Rio’s lips in a heated kiss that left Rio’s bones aching.</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled back then she got up, walking in rushed steps.</p><p align="left">Rio looked down at her body, tracing down the paint delicately, afraid she'd ruin Agatha’s work—so she touched it with ghosts of touches as her heart kept beating rapidly in her chest.</p><p align="left">Her body didn't betray her that often. She wasn't used of losing her control of it like this, Rio always felt it when it was coming. But around Agatha? She felt herself losing control of her body every time she was with her—to the point that a simple touch would make her tremble. Would turn her into a mess of desperation.</p><p align="left">Agatha was gone for a few minutes, and Rio was lying there, waiting for her to come back and tell her that she didn't mean to. Her body never cooled down.</p><p align="left">So Rio sat straight, she poured another glass of wine and chugged it down, then she grabbed the phone that was on the coffe table—Agatha’s, because she couldn't find hers nearby.</p><p align="left">She took a few photos of the mesmerising flowers painted on her skin, capturing their beauty.</p><p align="left">Then she moved the camera lower, her thighs and that goddamn dark patch of wetness on her underwear filled the frame. She hesitated as she looked at it, shivers kept running through her body as she felt flames burning under her. To see her desire visible and exposed. But she took the photo anyway, then she set the phone down. Biting on her lips in arousal and anticipation.</p><p align="left">Agatha came back and Rio’s mouth watered instinctively. She looked at her hips swaying as she approached her, Agatha’s eyes were dark with lust.</p><p align="left">She stood beside Rio’s lying body. Agatha leaned down slightly and crashed their mouths together, sharing the lingering taste of wine once again. Her hand was on the back of Rio’s neck, pushing her closer. </p><p align="left">As the kiss grew more and more heated, and Agatha kept sucking on Rio’s tongue, she sat in her place between Rio’s legs. Agatha leaned in, on top of Rio and their mouths didn't part.</p><p align="left">Rio lowered her hands down to take off Agatha’s sweatpants and she felt it, the hard object between her legs. Rio broke the kiss and pulled her head back slightly, looking up at Agatha as she felt the length of it once again.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck</em>,” she moaned heavily, feeling herself drip down on the couch. “<em>Oh, god. I need you to fuck me.</em>”</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in again and took Rio's mouth in another heated kiss.</p><p align="left">She pulled back and took her t-shirt off the next second. Then she stood up and took her sweatpants off, making Rio’s mouth water and run dry at the exact same second.</p><p align="left">The purple silicon standing between her legs made Rio feel more empty than what she was feeling before. </p><p align="left">She touched it for a good measure, tracing the length of it. It had been a really long time since she let someone fuck her with a strap-on.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned her hips in, making Rio wrap her hand around it. She started stroking it, drawing circles on the tip of it with her thumb, while looking up at Agatha who looked dazed and feral.</p><p align="left">Agatha sat between Rio's legs once again. </p><p align="left">She ran her fingers on Rio’s underwear, feeling how wet she was and how her cunt was radiating heat. </p><p align="left">Moving her fingers up and down Rio’s slit.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck, Agatha. Please,</em>” Rio begged as she felt herself unable to take it anymore. Unable to hold it in.</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled the underwear down slowly as the strong smell of Rio’s arousal hit both of their noses— it was even stronger than the lingering smell of paints.</p><p align="left">Once the fabric was out of her legs, Agatha clenched it with her hand tightly, she wasn't saying anything—but <em>god</em>, every movement of hers was screaming louder than any sound could ever scream.</p><p align="left">Agatha spread Rio's legs wider and her breath hitched in her throat as Rio started swallowing down hard.</p><p align="left">Agatha started palming Rio’s cunt, taking it all in with the movement. Going up and down, feeling her palm getting drenched immediately. She entered two of her fingers inside and Rio started moaning loudly.</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh god. </em>Please fill me up, Agatha. <em>Please</em>.” she pleaded again and Agatha started thrusting her two fingers inside. Then she added a third. </p><p align="left">Rio cried out, feeling Agatha filling her up was the closest she could get to heaven.</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled her drenched fingers out and Rio whined at the loss. </p><p align="left">She started stroking the strap, spreading Rio’s arousal all over it, making it glistening with her silk.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked up at Rio as she put the tip on her entrance.</p><p align="left">“Tell me when you're ready.” </p><p align="left">“I am. I’m ready, please. Just fill me, I need you.”</p><p align="left">Agatha pushed the length in gradually and Rio felt the way her walls kept clenching around it. Her breaths were unsteady and heavy as Agatha kept pushing in while looking at her to check in. The stretch Rio was feeling was delightful but god, she didn't think she'd be so tight around it.</p><p align="left">When Agatha pushed all the length in, making it disappear into Rio’s hole, her movements stilled.</p><p align="left">She extended her hand for Rio to hold, intertwining their fingers together as Agatha’s other hand kept stroking Rio's inner thigh gently. </p><p align="left">“Tell me when you'll get used to it and tell me when to move. Don't rush yourself.”</p><p align="left">Rio closed her eyes briefly. “<em>I didn't think it would be so…</em>”</p><p align="left">“So tight around me? Mhm, I figured that out, honey. But don't worry, it's okay. Everything is okay. Can you just breathe for me, baby? Can you do that?”</p><p align="left">Rio inhaled deeply then she exhaled a shaking breath as her eyes were glued on Agatha’s nose, looking at how gorgeous it was. Sculptured perfectly—by goddesses.</p><p align="left">As a few seconds passed, Rio spoke again.</p><p align="left">“I'm ready,” Rio voiced with a low tone and Agatha obliged. She started thrusting inside her deliberately.</p><p align="left">Gradually speeding up, thrusting in, until Rio started digging her short nails into Agatha’s back. Their hips met with every thrust as the sounds of their connection filled the atmosphere around them.</p><p align="left">“You're taking me so well baby. <em>So</em> well.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh, holy fuck…</em>”</p><p align="left">Agatha kept thrusting, praising Rio on how well she was taking her. How good she was around her. How perfect she looked—like a fucking ruined goddess.</p><p align="left">A few more thrusts and Rio came with a loud cry as Agatha guided their intertwined hands and laid them on the couch.</p><p align="left">Rio’s muscles tensed, her toes curled downward, her knuckles turned white from how hard she was holding Agatha’s hand as her other hand kept clinging onto Agatha’s back.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck.</em>”</p><p align="left">Her moans grew louder and louder. Her entire body was quivering underneath Agatha’s as if she was struck by lightning. Feeling her body trembling uncontrollably as Agatha’s thrusts continued and the waves of pleasure kept swirling inside Rio.</p><p align="left">Then her hold loosened and Agatha’s pace slowed down. But Rio kept trembling, her breaths were unsteady and heavy and she was gasping for air. </p><p align="left">Rio pushed Agatha’s body closer to her by her hold on her back—and the movement made her cry out as Agatha's length moved inside her, sending an unanticipated wave of pleasure.</p><p align="left">Rio buried her face in Agatha’s shoulder, smelling her and feeling how soft and warm her skin was.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s hips moved again and was about to pull out of Rio.</p><p align="left">“<em>Stay</em>,” Was the only word Rio could master.</p><p align="left">Agatha slightly pulled her face away and she nodded.</p><p align="left">Their half-lidded eyes met.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and kissed Rio tenderly—it was so tender Rio felt her heart might explode. </p><p align="left">Then Agatha sat straight on her heels, she took both of Rio’s legs and put them on her hips, then she put one of her hands on the small of Rio’s back and the other one below it and she lifted Rio’s body up.</p><p align="left">Rio was quick to secure her legs around Agatha’s middle and cling to her shoulders.</p><p align="left">“Don't want you to hurt your back,” Agatha said with a smirk then she leaned in and kissed Rio.</p><p align="left">She adjusted her body on the couch immediately while keeping her hold on Rio’s sweating body, not making a move to pull the length out of her just yet. Waiting for Rio to be ready.</p><p align="left">Then Agatha sat down. Her back resting against the couch with Rio <em>filled up</em> sitting on her lab her legs spread widely on her.</p><p align="left">Agatha put both of her hands on Rio’s hips, squeezing the flesh tightly. She looked down at the bluebells filling the side of Rio’s skin, then she leaned in and wrapped her mouth around one of Rio’s hard nipples, sucking on it.</p><p align="left">Rio closed her eyes as her hips jerked involuntarily, making her moan. Then Agatha’s hands started guiding her hips, encouraging her to move, to take it all if she wanted it.</p><p align="left">So, the moment Agatha pulled her head back, Rio lifted her body up then she sat down on the length— swallowing it all inside her as she cried out Agatha's name in the process. </p><p align="left">“Go on, baby. Take me.” Agatha encouraged again and Rio repeated the movement, until she was used to the pace that she set.</p><p align="left">“<em>You feel so… god. So fucking good inside me…</em>”</p><p align="left">Agatha’s thumb went lower and started rubbing on Rio’s throbbing clit and the movement made Rio's body twitch.</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh fuck… Agatha… I'm close</em>.”</p><p align="left">Agatha rubbed faster on the bundle of nerves as she kept biting her bottom lip and looking up at Rio’s flushed state.</p><p align="left">“You have absolutely no idea about how <em>fucking</em> beautiful you look right now.”</p><p align="left">Rio’s body twitched again as she felt herself on the edge, waiting to get pushed. She continued taking the length of Agatha, hitting that spot that made her unable to even distinguish what she was looking at.</p><p align="left">She was a mess of sweat, parted lips, curses and moans, heavy breaths, and the sound of her taking Agatha in entirely.</p><p align="left">A few more thrusts and Rio came again. Her hands were fisting Agatha’s hair as she came with a loud cry.</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh god, Agatha. Oh my god, Agatha.</em>”</p><p align="left">Her moans continued and her orgasm kept going on and on until Agatha moved her thumb away.</p><p align="left">Rio breathed in and out, struggling to steady her breaths. Her eyes were half-lidded, her cheeks were slightly pink and her body was glistened with sweat. She leaned in and took Agatha’s lips in a kiss as her hold in her hair loosened.</p><p align="left">A few long minutes passed, and they were tangled on the couch, bodies embracing and flush against each other. The atmosphere was filled with the smell of sex, sweat, pleasure and paints. </p><p align="left">Rio’s eyes were heavy, her body was ready to give up to sleep, so Agatha leaned in and kissed her chin, then up to her lips.</p><p align="left">“Can you walk?” Agatha whispered near her mouth.</p><p align="left">“Can't we just stay here?” </p><p align="left">“No, you'll regret it when you wake up. Come on, I'll carry you.”</p><p align="left">“I can walk,“ Rio smiled. “But can you please bring me the <em>coldest</em> water you have in your house?”</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled back. “Okay.”</p><p align="left">They got up, and apparently, Rio couldn't really walk, unless walking meant pausing after every step she took.</p><p align="left">So, Agatha helped walk her until they were in Agatha's bedroom. She put Rio in bed, then she went and brought a wet cloth and started wiping between Rio’s legs as carefully as she could.</p><p align="left">Then she used another one to wipe the sweat away, being careful around the paint on Rio’s body because Rio whined a spent-out “<em>Noooo.</em>” when Agatha touched it and wiped a little of it. </p><p align="left">Then Agatha kissed her, covered her body, and kissed her again. Then she went and brought the ice-cold water as requested. And Agatha was a little stunned to see Rio drink it in big gulps.</p><p align="left">“Your teeth don't... hurt you?” Agatha wondered, and Rio grinned.</p><p align="left">“Sometimes, yeah.”</p><p align="left">Then they tangled in bed again, whispering into each other's ears and feeling their bodies pressed together.</p><p align="left">Rio closed her heavy eyes and immediately gave up to sleep while Agatha kept brushing her skin with gentle fingertips. Humming a soft tone.</p>

<p align="center"><em>Nobody knows what I feel for you</em><br/><em>Just say the word and I'll be with you</em><br/><em>Golden eyes, I'll be with you</em><br/><em>Golden eyes, I shine for you</em></p><hr/><p><em>Shall I surrender to the ruin your eyes have vowed to me?</em><br/><em>Or shut mine tight, so I don’t become shards and scattered wreckage?</em></p><p>A week that felt visionary had passed.</p><p>A week filled with peacefulness Rio had never felt before. So much warmth she was wrapped with—warmth Rio was still feeling on her body as she sat down on her desk working. A week passed with softness. With <em>love</em>. With touches and colored marks that lingered on her skin. Whispered sweet words and promises made out loud in different places—whether lying side by side on the bed or being fucked on the kitchen island. With meals cooked from hands she had begun to worship, meals that tasted better than any time before because they were shared with the person that made Rio’s heart race in her chest.</p><p>A week filled with things Rio saw in herself for the first time. With unsteady breaths and heartbeats the reason of which wasn't a panic attack, but a great amount of feelings. With orgasms that made her arch her back forward and moan Agatha’s name over and over <em>and</em> over again. With texts and photos and small notes on scrapped papers that made her days full.</p><p>With going to Agatha’s place almost every day just because she missed her presence and scent—even though Agatha was lying next to her, covered with her green duvet the night before. With smiling mid-lectures as she remembered her. With dates that started outdoors with the delicious warm smell of a cinnamon roll surrounding them, and ended indoors, with hot heavy breaths and the smell of pleasure filling the atmosphere.</p><p>It was a week filled with everything Rio hadn’t even dared to dream of, because these things were so out of reach that she forgot they even existed. Then, with a flick of her fingers, Agatha was there, handing them to Rio with a smile, asking her not to dream but to take because she deserved.</p><p>It was a week that somehow, in a way, the days of it felt longer. As if the illusion of time itself was giving Rio the opportunity to linger in the moments. To live and feel them fully.</p><p>And Rio found herself wondering, since when waking up started to be a thing she looked forward to? And she would look to her side and see the answer lying there, an answer shaped as a woman, as <em>an ethereal being. </em></p><p>Since Agatha.</p><p>Just like after a storm the night before, Rio opened the windows to look at the ruins the sky caused, only to be met with the sun shining and illuminating the world. Apologizing and trying to fix something it wasn't the one who broke.</p><hr/><p>It has been half a day since Agatha had gone to Paris for some art galleries she had to attend. When Rio insisted on driving her to the airport. When they kissed each other with warmth and a promise. A kiss that both of them used to say ‘<em>Even for a few days I can't be apart from you.</em>’ Pouring their feelings into each other’s mouths. And as they pulled back to look into each other’s eyes, Rio tried her best not to show how saddened she was.</p><p>“Don't look at me like that, you know I can't resist it.” Agatha said, as she gently brushed Rio’s cheek with her thumb.</p><p>“Good, because I don't want you to resist me.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in and kissed her again. A shorter kiss in time, but no less intense and warm.</p><p>“Wait for me, hmm? Just a few days.”</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>A third kiss. Then their intertwined fingers parted. </p><p>Their eyes met briefly before Agatha turned around to walk away from her. Rio felt her heart pound in her chest, she grabbed Agatha’s wrist gently and made her turn around to face her again, to look into her eyes and get pulled into them.</p><p>“I—”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Rio leaned in this time and embraced Agatha tightly, burying her face in her shoulder, inhaling her. Feeling her warmth.</p><p>“<em>You will come back to me.</em>” Rio whispered.</p><p>It wasn't a question, it was a hope. It was the alternative to what was on the tip of her tongue. It was the way she used to show a little bit of what was happening inside her. It was a way to try not to think about the last time Agatha had gone. To reassure herself that now? Now it was different. </p><p>“I will. I promise.” Agatha brushed her hair gently, leaning in to press a soft kiss to Rio’s hair. When they pulled back, there was a smile on Agatha’s face—a smile that made Rio’s heart tighten in her chest in the softest way. Agatha lifted her hand up and cupped Rio’s face, brushing the skin softly with her fingertips as their eyes locked.</p><p>“Trust me, there's no better place I'd like to be other than with you, Rio. So I'll be back as soon as I can.”</p><p>And they parted. Again.</p><p>But this time, Rio knew the destination. Knew where Agatha was heading. She had a promise of coming back to count on, replacing the <em>maybe tomorrow’s</em> in her pocket with a new currency.</p><p>Agatha didn't casually disappear into thin air and left Rio hanging like a nail waiting to get hammered, Agatha, this time, walked away and Rio saw her as she did. Counted her steps until she disappeared.</p><p>It felt absurd even to herself, the fact that she missed Agatha even when she was still within her eyesight to reach.</p><p>And she missed her even more when she wasn't. </p><p>It felt absurd because it felt <em>real</em>. Because Rio felt her heart racing in her chest. Because she stood there, frozen, as people walked past her. As noise surrounded her. As the world continued to spin, while the only urge she had was to run and follow Agatha. Just like how they did in those stupid rom-coms.</p><p>Rio loathed waiting. She despised longing. </p><p><em>Look at me, just look at me.</em><br/><em>I pine for you even when you're within my reach.</em><br/><em>I crave your eyes, just so they’d glance at me in the stillness of your sleep.</em><br/><em>So tell me, then</em><br/><em>What am I to do</em><br/><em>When the distance stretches beyond my reach?</em></p><p>When she got back to her home that day, the discomfort of it was nowhere to be sensed. Because Rio’s haven was filled with Agatha now. Her touches lingered everywhere. Glimpses of her changed the place down from its foundation.</p><p>Her scent filled the air. That purple clay mug she made herself and gave to Rio set on the coffee table. The sketch of Rio’s smiling face on a scrap of paper was stuck on the fridge with an olive magnet, and beside it was a note that made Rio’s heart tighten in her chest when she woke on a random Wednesday and found it: “<em>I love your golden eyes, Rio</em>”.</p><p>Opening the fridge to see the groceries Agatha bought on Thursday after scolding her about not eating well.</p><p>Agatha’s silver rings sitting on the nightstand. Her t-shirt on Rio’s bed waiting for her to put on. And that painting that Agatha had called <em>Río Vidal</em> sitting in the corner waiting to be hung. The painting Agatha brought in the middle of the night, saying Rio had forgot it, as an excuse she used to fuck Rio senseless that night.</p><p>So yeah, Agatha was everywhere. Rio was feeling her inside. Sensing her in the air. Seeing her in the little details.</p><p>But still, she wasn't within her reach to hold. To feel the warmth of her body. To taste her fully.</p><p>With Agatha’s absence, Rio found herself spiraling in her head. Going back in time. Digging the graves and carry the bones on her shoulders.</p><p>Separating with someone. Separating with her loved ones. She experienced that, too many times to be counted. And it never ended well for her.</p><p>Whether the separation was on good terms or the complete opposite of that.</p><p>Whether it was lying in a tent and the distance was only a few steps, or continents away.</p><p>It never ended well, and that was why her heart was pounding and Rio's entire body and mind were plagued with paranoia mixed with panic and traumatic memories.</p><p>The <em>what if’s</em> flooded her whole being. Even if Agatha would be gone only for a few days. Even after thinking of it with sense, she found herself being childish.</p><p>She couldn't stop thinking as she lay in bed, wearing Agatha’s t-shirt, sensing and smelling her.</p><p>What if Agatha won't come back?</p><p>What if something happens there?</p><p>What if she finds herself more comfortable there than in Rio’s embrace?</p><p>What if the peace Rio was feeling in Agatha’s presence was one-sided?</p><p>But it can't be.</p><p>All the devotion that Rio felt.  All that tenderness and understanding that Agatha showed and offered.</p><p>The promises. The whispers. The affection. </p><p>The way Rio felt about herself because of Agatha. The way Rio started to feel Agatha fully inside her.</p><p>Growing. Consuming. Living.</p><p>That didn't just feel real. It was real.</p><p>It <em>is</em> real.</p><p>“<em>I just want you to let me in. Will you let me in?</em>” </p><p>“<em>Yes. But will you?</em>”</p><p>“<em>You're already in, Rio.</em>”</p><p>Nothing Agatha had ever said felt hollow or meaningless.</p><p>Everything she said hit Rio exactly in the right place. Right in her core, deep insie her. Assuring her in every way possible.</p><p>“<em>Nowhere really held my heart the way Paris did... You remind me of every beautiful memory I had there. I don't know why, but... I see them in your eyes, shining—and that is not a metaphor.”</em></p><p>Agatha will think of her there. She will.</p><p>If Rio reminded her of Paris, then Paris will remind her of Rio.</p><p>If she saw the beautiful memories shining in Rio’s golden eyes, then she'll look at the starry Parisian sky and find Rio there.</p><p>And that was the thought she slept thinking of the night Agatha was gone.</p><p>She trusted Agatha. </p><p>Rio <em>really</em> did.</p><p>Rio stirred in her sleep as the sound of messages arriving echoed in the stillness of her dark room. She half opened her eyes as she grabbed her phone and looked at it, the bright light of the screen burned her eyes.</p><p><em>I just arrived at the hotel. I'll try to get some sleep for a few hours, then I'll meet my friend for dinner.</em></p><p><em>Don't worry at all and sleep well. </em></p><p><em>And call me when you can, please.</em></p><p>Rio looked at her phone, its light was illuminating her face.</p><p>She read the messages over and over again with half-opened, burning eyes while smiling. Feeling something <em>still</em> deep inside her—something that was moving way too much in the past few hours. She felt peace washing over her. All the negative thoughts she had been thinking of earlier had vanished and got replaced with certainty and safety.</p><p>She didn't reply, she just fell back to sleep. Sinking into the mattress. Her eyes closed peacefully on their own.</p><hr/><p>Her phone buzzed on her desk, and Rio’s face lit up immediately as a soft smile found its way to her lips the moment she looked down at it. She picked it up and swiped to answer.</p><p>“Hey, beautiful,” her grin was visible in her greeting.</p><p>“Hey, gorgeous,” Agatha’s voice was deep, as if she was breathless. </p><p>“Thought you were out. Didn't you go with your friend <em>Augustine</em>?”</p><p>“I wish my name was Augustine so I'd hear you say it like that.”</p><p>“Oh god, shut up.” Rio chuckled as a blush crept to her face. “What are you doing then?”</p><p>“<em>Thinking of you, angel.</em>” Agatha’s voice grew lower. Deeper.</p><p>Rio deeply exhaled through her nose. Her foolish grin was still visible on her face as she got up from her chair and sat on the couch, holding her coffee in the other hand, feeling her heart pound in her chest.</p><p>She heard Agatha sigh heavily.</p><p>“Is there something wrong? You sound… Are you sick?”</p><p>Rio crossed her legs and took a sip of her drink as she waited for Agatha to respond.</p><p>“<em>No.</em>” Was the only thing Agatha said after a few long seconds of silence.</p><p>“Agatha? What's going on?” Rio's brow frowned in confusion and worry as she leaned to put her coffee on the table in front of her, uncrossing her legs and leaning back on the couch.</p><p>“<em>I miss you,</em>” Agatha said breathlessly, as a soft whimper followed her confession.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened immediately. Agatha’s words made a shiver run down her spine, making her chest rise and fall with heavy breaths.</p><p>“Oh my god. What are you doing?” She asked in awe, even though it wasn't really a question.</p><p>“When did you take that photo? Hmm?” Agatha asked, her tone was so low she sounded <em>numb</em>. And Rio already started imagining Agatha’s half-lidded eyes, her parted lips, lying somewhere <em>and</em> touching herself.</p><p>Rio got up in a hurry, almost out of her mind, and closed her office door. The sound of shutting it was louder than she intended, making it echo in the hallway. Its sound blended with her rapid heartbeats.</p><p>She leaned against the door with a soft thud and squeezed her eyes shut as she clenched the phone closer to her ear.</p><p>“What photo?” Rio asked as her own breaths started to get heavier only from picturing Agatha and listening to her heavy breathing. </p><p>Agatha moaned and Rio clenched the phone tighter, making the veins on her hand darker as she felt her knees grow weaker—as if she couldn't even hold her own weight. And the cause was a moan.</p><p>“Agatha, what photo?” She asked again. Her voice was barely above a whisper.</p><p>“The one after you came through my underwear, baby.”</p><p>“Oh, fuck me.”</p><p>“<em>Trust me, it's the only thing in my head right now.</em>”</p><p>“Fuck. I'm at work.” Rio ran a hand through her hair as she walked back to the couch. “I told that kid I will look into…” Another moan. “Fuck it. God… please tell me what exactly you are doing.”</p><p>“Fucking <em>myself</em> because I can't fuck <em>you</em>. Touching myself while looking at your photo, Rio, wishing you were here. Missing my dinner with my friend because you're the only thing I'm thinking of. Missing you so much it feels like it has been months since I last saw you. I feel my self-control is thrown into a wall because I can't resist even the thought of you.”</p><p>“Jesus christ, Agatha.”</p><p>“Do you want me to cum, Rio? While looking at your photo? Or should I wait a few days so you can handle me yourself?”</p><p>“Fuck. <em>Fuck</em>. I want you to wait for me, so I can take care of you myself. But god, I don't want to torture you.”</p><p>“<em>Oh, honey. I want you to torture me.</em>”</p><p>“Then remove your fingers and wait for me to pleasure you.”</p><p>“Mhm. I will.”</p><p>In the following few seconds, Rio heard the sound of Agatha licking her own fingers. Tasting herself and making Rio dizzy with lust and need, biting her bottom lip harshly.</p><p>Her phone buzzed in her hand, and she looked down at it, a photo from Agatha.</p><p>“Now you have yours,”</p><p>Agatha said through the open line into Rio’s ear and Rio’s mouth hung wide open.</p><p>Agatha was lying on the beige couch in her hotel room, lying in the same position as Rio was in that photo. Wearing the same fucking sky-blue underwear with the little bow on the waistband that Rio wore. </p><p>Agatha’s patch of wetness was even darker, and there weren’t any bluebells drawn on her captivating, pale skin. </p><p>Rio’s breath hitched and she was swallowing really hard as she continued observing the photo. Looking at <em>every</em> detail and sighing constantly, feeling herself dripping down. Turned on and helpless.</p><p>“<em>This is all from thinking of you.</em>” </p><p>“This is so unfair. You know I'm at work,” Rio said in helplessness. Her eyes never left that photo, looking at how Agatha’s hand cupped one of her breasts and the other was available for Rio’s eyes to devour.</p><p>“Come on, you know it wasn't intentional.” Agatha laughed. The sound was low and <em>intoxicating</em>.</p><p>Rio was fighting to stay sober at this time of the day, and here she was, drunk because of a laugh.</p><p>“Yeah. Right. It wasn't intentional to wear the same fucking underwear.” Rio zoomed in. Staring. “Can you… Fuck. Send me another one.”</p><p>“Are we getting greedy, baby?”</p><p>“Come on, please. You started this. Let me see your face.”</p><p>“<em>You</em> started it. Now do your work so you can call me when you get home.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“What? I don't want to distract you.” Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“You can't seriously be saying that <em>now</em>.”</p><p>“Aw, why is that? Are you distracted, sweetheart?”</p><p>The office door swung open and Rio immediately pulled her legs closer together, feeling the uncomfortable wetness between her thighs as she did so.</p><p>“Alice! Goddamn it, knock!”</p><p>“Shut up.” Alice closed the door behind her and turned around, facing Rio. “Stop acting like you could possibly be giving head in here. Honey, you're dry as a fucking desert.”</p><p>“What if I was really giving head?!” Rio's voice rose and she heard Agatha’s low laugh through the phone. Making her pupils dilate widely. Feeling her control slipping.</p><p>“Then I'd fucking cheer you up, but <em>obviously</em> you aren’t.”</p><p>“You don't know if I'm giving head or not.”</p><p>“<em>I wish you were giving me head,</em>” Agatha said into Rio’s ear, making her freeze in her place. “<em>It would feel so good to have your mouth on me right now</em>.”</p><p>Rio clenched the phone tighter. She felt like she might break it as Alice walked forward, talking about something—Rio didn't even hear a thing of.</p><p>“<em>Ah, Rio,</em>” Agatha moaned, and Rio felt herself on the verge of breaking down. “<em>I need you, baby.</em>”</p><p>“Please, don't do that to me. <em>Please,</em>” Rio pleaded with a whisper, making sure Alice didn't hear her. </p><p>Agatha chuckled into her ear. “Okay.”</p><p>“Anyway,” Alice said as she sat down, “that bitch called me yesterday.”</p><p>“What bitch?”</p><p>“Your ex. The psycho one.”</p><p>“What? What the fuck?”</p><p>“I don't know dude. She said something about a miscarriage. And about how she can't reach you and all. Was she pregnant? I don't remember that plot twist happening. Did you impregnate her? Don't gatekeep the secret, Rio. How did that happen?” Alice laughed.</p><p>“What is it, Rio? Is everything okay?” Agatha asked. Her tone had shifted.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, it's nothing. I will call you later, okay?” Rio said and hung up without waiting for Agatha to respond.</p><p>“That's not funny, Alice. That bitch got pregnant when that fucker knocked her out, I guess. But why the fuck she told you that?”</p><p>“I don't know. Her victim complex is insane.”</p><p>“What did you tell her?”</p><p>“She just kept rambling and gave me a headache. I said okay, then blocked her number,” Alice chuckled and so did Rio.</p><p>“God, how I want to punch her stupid face.”</p><p>“I second this. Anyway, who was that?”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“That woman who got you blushing like that. Who is she?” Alice smirked, teasingly.</p><p>Rio looked at Alice’s eyes. She felt herself being caught off guard. Was it really <em>that</em> obvious?</p><p><em>That woman who got her blushing?</em></p><p>Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“She's…” Rio leaned in to get her cup. “A woman I met a while ago.” </p><p>“Yeah? Who is she? Does she by any chance have a name?”</p><p>Rio looked at Alice. “Agatha,” She said, busying herself with drinking her coffee, trying not to meet Alice’s gaze.</p><p>“I knew it! Oh my god, Rio.” </p><p>“We're not a thing yet. We're just getting to know each other!” Rio said immediately, trying to dismiss it, though her smile betrayed her.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness. Damn. I need to know everything. Like, absolutely everything. Why the hell didn't you tell me?”</p><p>“I've been busy and there's nothing to talk about. Really.”</p><p>“You're a terrible liar, you know that?”</p><p>“Oh my god, just shut up.”</p><p>“I won't. We should definitely go on a double date.”</p><p>“Double date my ass, Alice.”</p><p>“What? I want to know her. Because I know she's a good artist and I'm such a fan of her work, but… I heard she could be a bitch. Hard to deal with and...”</p><p>“No, don't. Don't talk about her like that, <em>ever</em>.” Rio pointed a finger at her friend. “And heard from whom exactly?” Her voice rose uncontrollably as her brow frowned.</p><p>“Well, that's what her ex told me.”</p><p>“Her ex? The redhead?” </p><p>“Yes, I've hang out with her a few times since your birthday. And… we just talked.”</p><p>“So the topic was Agatha? What did she tell you?”</p><p>“A lot, honestly. She talks a lot.”</p><p>“Oh, wow. What that <em>a lot </em>was?”</p><p>“Okay, calm down. She just told me about their relationship and how toxic it was.”</p><p>“Come on, Alice. Say it. What did she tell you?”</p><p>Alice crossed her legs and leaned back on the couch, looking Rio in the eyes.</p><p>“She talked about Agatha’s constant cheating. How irresponsible she was. She didn't say Agatha’s name <em>explicitly</em>, but I did ask whether that ex was Agatha or not and she confirmed it.”</p><p>“Great. Well, you don't know her, Alice. But I do. Agatha? <em>My</em> Agatha? God, she's the best human being I've ever met, and I mean it. That woman? She makes me feel alive, Alice. To the point that she's away from me right now and I feel like I could run through the continents between us just to reach her. <em>Just to kiss her</em>.” She lowered her voice when she said the last few words.</p><p>Rio inhaled deeply. “You of all people should know damn well how exes say bullshit all the time, Alice. Take Jane as an example, she makes herself the victim while she's nothing but a psycho bitch. So, no. Whatever the fuck Wanda had said, it's not the truth. It's bullshit.”</p><p>“God, Rio Vidal. Are you in love?”</p><p>“Am I? Do I love her? I don't know. But do I feel that woman living inside me? Yes, I do.”</p><p>Alice smirked. “Okay, I'm sorry I talked about her like that. But I still would like to meet her.”</p><p>“You will. But not now.”</p><p>After talking for a few more minutes, Rio kicked Alice out with a grin, telling her to go see her life or whatever.</p><p>Once Alice was out of her office, Rio exhaled a deep breath she didn't even know she was holding. She ran a hand through her hair, feeling her heart pound in her chest. Her head was full with thoughts and images. Paranoia crept into her system.</p><p>Rio grabbed her phone, seeing a message from Agatha.</p><p><em>What happened, Rio? Talk to me.</em></p><p>Rio looked at the message for a long time, the letters started to blend together. What once was a coherent question now didn't make any sense.</p><p>She exhaled deeply, took her blazer off, then sat down.</p><p>She called Agatha and waited as the phone rang in her ear.</p><p>“Hi. Sorry I hung up on you like that.”</p><p>“It's okay. What happened?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“What do you mean nothing? And your ex?” Agatha's voice was filled with furiousness.</p><p>Rio had never heard Agatha speak with that tone before now.</p><p>“What? We hardly talked about her, Agatha. Why are you talking to me like that?”</p><p>“Like what, Rio?”</p><p>“Like I'm lying to you. I'm not.”</p><p>Silence stretched between them for a long agonizing seconds. Just listening to each other breathing.</p><p>“I'm sorry. I just… I'm sorry, Rio.”</p><p>“There's something I want to talk about with you.”</p><p>“What is it? Tell me. Anything.”</p><p>“No, not like that. Not over a phone call. Not while you're away from me like that. So when you come back, we will talk about it.”</p><p>“Okay. When I come back. When will you go home?”</p><p>“In a few minutes.”</p><p>“Good. And if that... <em>bitch</em> tried to reach you, you tell me immediately. Understood?”</p><p>“She won't.”</p><p>“I said understood, Rio?”</p><p>“Yes. Understood.”</p><hr/><p>Rio drove back home, her mind was spiraling. Thinking and thinking. Running in a maze she found herself inside, with no exit to be found. </p><p>But she could wait. She <em>must</em> wait.</p><p>She won't let her thoughts control her. She will wait for Agatha to come back. She will ask her, and she'll get the answers she was looking for. It's just a few days. </p><p>Just three days. Three days are nothing.</p><p>When she stepped inside, she inhaled deeply as she looked around the space. She took her shoes off by the door, then went upstairs to take a shower, to organize the chaos in her head. </p><p>But instead, she sat on the toilet seat, naked, smoking her second cigarette as she stared into nothing while thinking about everything.</p><p>Maybe she was greedy for asking the universe to give her another week of stillness and now she was getting punished with chaos.</p><p>Rio got out after taking that shower, her body and hair were dripping water, not even caring about drying off. </p><p>She put on one of her oversized t-shirts and went downstairs.</p><p>Rio cooked herself the pasta Agatha had taught her how to make a few days ago. When Agatha stood behind her, wrapped her arms around her waist, her head resting on Rio’s shoulder as she told her what to do and what not to do.</p><p>She grabbed her phone and took a photo of the meal, then she sent it to Agatha.</p><p>Rio left the plate on the table and got up to bring the bottle of vodka from the freezer.</p><p>She held a glass in one hand to pour the liquid into, but then she put it back on the counter, opened the bottle, and drank straight from it.</p><p>Rio stood there for a few minutes, leaning against the counter as she sipped, feeling the burn of the alcohol filling her whole—tasteless and unforgiving, but worked like a fucking healer. Taking her head elsewhere, even if it was temporarily.</p><p>Then she walked back to her awaiting dish. She took a forkful of pasta, followed by a sip or a gulp of alcohol.</p><p>It was 2PM</p><p>Why did she drink? She didn't know. </p><p>But she also didn't know why she shouldn't.</p><p>It was a grey area. You push it to black or white whenever you want. Or that was what Rio had convinced herself with. </p><p>After a few bites, the taste became unbearable. The meal felt tasteless because Agatha wasn't there to flavor it with her glances. With her playful remarks. Or her legs touching Rio’s under the table, making her squirm in her place.</p><p>She put the plate on the sink, grabbed her bottle, and went upstairs. </p><p>Rio lay in her bed, looking at Agatha’s photo—the one she sent earlier. Zooming in and staring as she carried on drinking. </p><p>She felt herself dripping but she didn't do anything about it. She intended on working herself up, putting herself on the edge of exploding.</p><p>When she couldn't edge herself any longer, Rio grabbed her laptop. Took her shirt off and remained in her black sport bra and green boxers. Then she video-called Agatha.</p><p>It rang for a few long seconds, Rio was beginning to think about canceling the idea.</p><p>Then Agatha answered. She was wearing a white robe, her hair was wet and falling by her sides, a glass of scotch in hand. She was sitting on a wooden lounge in the balcony, surrounded by the darkness of the night and stillness of the Parisian neighborhood she was in. Only the moonlight was illuminating her face.</p><p>Agatha didn't say a word at first, she just looked at Rio through the screen, from her face down to her abdomen—because of how Rio laid her laptop.</p><p>Agatha licked her lips, and Rio noticed the glim in her eyes and the faint smirk on her face.</p><p>“Does the starry sky of Paris remind you of me?” Rio asked as she brought the laptop closer to her. Her eyes were half-lidded. Her cheeks were slightly pink from the alcohol and her arousal.</p><p>“Everything reminds me of you, Rio. Not only the sky,” Agatha said, then she sipped her drink. “You look tired. You didn't sleep well?”</p><p>“No, it's not the sleep. The sleep is fine. It's… I was... thinking and I'm a little drunk and <em>sooo</em> turned on and I miss you so much. You look so beautiful right now. It's making me ache. It's so heavy. All of it.”</p><p>“What happened, Rio? Are you okay?” Agatha said as she put her drink aside and took her laptop, placing it on her lap. Her face was closer to Rio’s eyes now, but still <em>not</em> within her reach.</p><p>Rio sat against the headboard, then she took her bra off.</p><p>She grabbed the half-empty bottle of Vodka from the nightstand and gulped, then she put it back down. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand as she cupped one of her breasts. Then both of them. Palming them roughly.</p><p>“Take your robe off, let me see you. <em>Please</em>.”</p><p>Agatha let out a loud sigh that turned into a soft whimper. She didn't hesitate a second. She took her robe off and threw it somewhere. She was completely bare. The moonlight falling down on her. Making her look holy and <em>so</em> out of reach as the cold breeze played with her hair. </p><p>Agatha took her glass and swirled the ice in it as she looked at Rio.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as she felt the unsettling sensations burn in her lower abdomen.</p><p>“Tell me what to do,” Rio said as she started feeling herself. “Tell me what I should do to myself. Tell me how to please you.” She continued, her fingers were brushing the skin between her breasts. “Tell me how to make you feel me while you're away. Just tell me. Give me instructions. Guide me.”</p><p>“Oh, god. Just touch yourself, <em>for me</em>,” Agatha breathed out, and Rio started moving her fingers lower. She straightened up and started rubbing hard on her clit as she continued pinching her nipples.</p><p>Agatha clicked her tongue.</p><p>“No. Go slower. Gently. Don't hurt what's mine,” Agatha commanded, and Rio obeyed, watching Agatha move her hands to her own heat, making her eyes widen in lust.</p><p>“Let me hear you.” </p><p>Rio didn't moan. She entered two of her fingers inside and let Agatha hear the sound of her fingers pumping in and out of her. Making her hear how drenched she was instead of showing her.</p><p>“Oh baby. What got you so worked up? Hmm?”</p><p>“You Agatha. It's only you. It's always you.” Rio confessed as she closed her eyes, breathing heavily. Her chest was rising and falling rapidly. “I trust you with my life, Agatha.” she said as she felt her orgasm approaching. Building faster than she anticipated.</p><p>“I'm gonna—”</p><p>“Let go for me. Go on,” Agatha said as her fingers started moving faster on herself.</p><p>“<em>God, how I want to kiss you right now</em>,” Rio said, breathless. And a second later she came with a loud moan, letting it echo in the room. And Agatha followed her a few seconds later, her orgasmic moan was soft and low, blending with the breeze as her chest rose and fell.</p><p>Rio opened her eyes the moment Agatha did. Their eyes locked through the screens.</p><p>“<em>I love your golden eyes, Rio.</em>”</p>

<p align="center"><em>Somebody good shouldn't feel so bad</em><br/><em>Well, I must've done something to deserve to feel this sad</em></p><hr/><p>Was it jealousy or her fear of being cheated on again?</p><p>The fear of someone finding out that she was unworthy. Undeserving. And below it all. The fear of repeating it all again. The fear of seeing someone leaving. Walking out against her will. And she'd be sitting, like always, expected to move on.</p><p>She couldn't even distinguish that. The lines blurred, and so did her ability to be coherent. To know.</p><p>None of it was real.</p><p>It was just in her head.</p><p>Everything she was thinking about right now was nothing but her rotting mind’s way to get her. To push her sanity to the edge.</p><p>And Rio? She knew that.</p><p>But did she?</p><p>Did she know, as she lay on her front. Naked, drunk, her head was thudding, floating with no destination to reach.</p><p>Still feeling like she was getting away from everything.</p><p>Feeling herself as nothing but plaguing thoughts glued together.</p><p>Lying on Agatha’s side of the bed. Letting the sheets consume her body whole. Burying her face in the pillow and inhaling Agatha’s lingering scent.</p><p>Blurry images befogged her.</p><p>Agatha on that beige hotel room couch. She was lying one second, and the next, she would be sitting straight. Visualization Agatha being touched by a woman. A woman that wasn't her. A woman that didn't have a face Rio could even recognize. It was a mix of every painting Agatha’s hands had crafted. Every face Rio saw in them. And they were haunting.</p><p>The faces blended and blurred together. The features moved constantly, just like how the fingers constantly brushed Agatha’s skin.</p><p>The images were a melting wax dripping down onto Rio’s head, scorching and merciless.</p><p>Her head was ticking like a time bomb. Feeling like her skull might just explode at any moment. And there wasn't any right wire to cut. They were all black and would explode, whether they were cut or not.</p><p>She wanted to get up and just bang her head into a wall and make it all stop.</p><p>Every time it would tick-tock, she would bang it.</p><p>But she wasn't even able to move her body.</p><p>She wasn't aware of anything around her. She couldn't even feel her body lying there. Hot and sweating constantly.</p><p>But the dizziness was sharp and agonizing, making her spin in her place as the blurred images continued to fuck her up.</p><p>But she knew.</p><p>It was not real.</p><p>It couldn't be.</p><p>Agatha was talking with her two hours ago. She was there. Until she wasn't. </p><p>Until Rio was staring at the screen and Agatha was nowhere to be seen. Only the picture of her. The thought of her was floating in Rio’s mind.</p><p>Agatha smiled at her, that beautiful smile of hers. The smile that illuminated what was around, even in the pitch darkness of the night.</p><p>They looked into each other’s eyes.</p><p>Their chests were heavy. Rising and falling constantly. Lungs rushing to be filled with air.</p><p>“<em>I love your golden eyes, Rio.</em>”</p><p>Rio felt her heart fall down into her stomach.</p><p>And suddenly, all the things she wanted to say minutes ago were pulled down into the void, and her head went blank. Swept completely.</p><p>She just sat there against the headboard, with her flushed face and heavy breaths. Staring at Agatha.</p><p>She Looked into her eyes, they were glinting, just like the stars in the sky above her head.</p><p>Despite the silence that hung between them, Rio’s head was anything but. Her ears were filled with the sound of her heart racing inside her chest. Knocking. Banging forcefully, as if it were begging to get out. Unable to handle all of this.</p><p>And as the minutes passed and the silence stretched, Rio felt herself getting filled with emotions as she kept staring into Agatha’s eyes through the screen.</p><p>Through the distance.</p><p>Emotions she didn't dare think about when she was sober and alone, let alone feel them. Say them out loud.</p><p>Neither of them uttered a single word. Just… staring.</p><p>The sunlight cut through the slightly pulled curtains, Rio wasn't even able to adjust it. Illuminating half of her face in the middle of the hush. Making her irises lighter, surrounding her dilated dark pupils. The bright afternoon sunlight reflected the flower shapes sewn into the curtain. Their shadows painted on Rio’s tanned skin.</p><p>A faint one stamped on the side of her jaw. Another resting lower on her pulse point. Two others scattered, one on her breast and a fading one lying lower.</p><p>On the other end, the moonlight was falling down on Agatha. Making her glow as she sat on that wooden lounge. As if all the earth’s spotlight poured down on her bare body. Her collarbones were as sharp as her lethal jaw. The night breeze helped dry her wet hair, making a few of its dark locks curl into each other, into waves.</p><p>And she was staring at Rio, with her gleaming eyes.</p><p>As the sun reflected its light on Rio’s body, the moon reflected the sun’s light on Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha whispered hesitantly. Softly breaking the tranquility of the night, the hush of Rio’s room, and the silence that begun to stretch between them.</p><p>“Did something happen, Rio?”</p><p>Rio felt herself being pulled into the planet again after she was floating in space. After she was holding her breath and floating in the universe Agatha’s eyes held inside. </p><p>She exhaled, and just... stared.</p><p>She leaned in to grab the bottle of alcohol from beside her.</p><p>“Baby, can you put that down and talk to me? Tell me what's wrong?” Agatha said the moment the mouth of the bottle touched Rio’s lips. Her voice was still soft, almost pleading, and yet, it commanded.</p><p>But Rio didn't listen. She closed her eyes and gulped, twice, then she placed the bottle down. </p><p>She wiped her lips with her thumb as she looked into Agatha’s eyes.</p><p><em>Did something happen?</em></p><p>How could she possibly know and talk about it with Agatha when she herself didn't know?</p><p>When she was struggling to hang on to one single thought in the middle of all this?</p><p>“Nothing. Nothing wrong. I just wanted to get fucked by you.” She mumbled the words as she bent up her legs and brought them closer to her chest.</p><p>“Maybe ruined. Maybe fixed.”</p><p>A single blink.</p><p>“Is there something wrong with wanting you so much?”</p><p>“<em>Rio…</em>”</p><p>“It's not that I don't trust you, god, of course I do.” A hand ran through her hair. “But what's my position in all of this? Where am I standing?” </p><p>She looked into Agatha’s eyes. Tears started falling down her face. Transparent, fast and punishing. As if they weren’t falling in the first place. But Rio’s eyes got red and burned her immediately.</p><p>“I'm weak for you. So weak, Agatha. I swear I don't know what's happening. <em>Please</em>. Just come back.”</p><p>A knock on Agatha’s room door made Rio blink her tears away, making them fall faster and in doubles.</p><p>She looked at the door behind Agatha from a distance.</p><p>But Agatha didn't, she was just looking at Rio.</p><p>The moment her lips parted, about to say something, the knock came again. A little louder. Someone said something in French. A woman's voice.</p><p>Rio couldn't hear properly, and even if she did, she wouldn't have understood.</p><p>Then a third knock.</p><p>And she heard Agatha’s name, called through a whine.</p><p>Her heart sank deeper, her brow frowned under the disgusting, heavy weight of it all. The sudden rush inside her body made her feel pathetic. vulnerable.</p><p>“Who’s knocking at your door at this time?” She wiped the edges of her eyes, her fingertips were glistening with her tears.</p><p>“Won't you go see who it is?” </p><p>“It's just my friend,”</p><p>And the door swung open.</p><p>Revealing a drunk brunette. A cigarette resting between her lips, key card in her hand, and a smile hanging off her flushed face. </p><p><em>Another ex.</em></p><p>Rio saw her from across the room, and it plagued her. Rio was drunk, unable of coherenting words, and yet, she recognized her immediately. </p><p>She had seen that woman once. In Agatha’s studio. A portrait of her, lying against a wall.</p><p>Agatha quickly got up, searching for her white robe on the floor then she put it on immediately.</p><p>“I'm sorry baby. I'll just go and see what she wants, I'll be right back.” </p><p>The woman walked forward, mumbling in French.</p><p>Rio couldn't understand the language on its own, let alone when it was drunk French.</p><p>Rio felt dizzy. Everything was spinning.</p><p>Feeling too many emotions at the same time and none of them was pleasant. They were all nauseating.</p><p>Agatha mouthed something, but the woman only smiled. She tied Agatha’s robe as she looked into her eyes.</p><p>Or did she untie it?</p><p>And Rio kept looking at them. Feeling herself slip away from it all.</p><p>From Agatha. </p><p>The brunette placed her palms on Agatha’s shoulders and started swaying her body to the sound of the street.</p><p>The annoying car horns beeping. The night wind hitting the speaker. And the sound of the drunken chuckles.</p><p>They all filled Rio’s ears.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>Agatha pushed the woman back slightly, making her take a step backward. And that was when Rio leaned in and ended the call. </p><p>Staring at the screen in front of her.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>She fisted her hand and placed it over her heart. It was pounding rapidly.</p><p>Because it hurt.</p><p>And as she lay there, burying her face, trying to calm the voices, to erase the images that assaulted her.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>It really did.</p><p>She wanted to believe it. To believe that what happened in front of her eyes—what she saw—wasn't what she thought or have seen.</p><p>But how? </p><p>How, when it hurt like that?</p><p>Rio’s phone kept vibrating on the nightstand. </p><p>The buzzing blended with her thoughts. As if it wasn't already chaotic enough in her head, she needed a cherry on top to decorate the fucking mess.</p><p>She only looked at it two hours ago, when Agatha called the first time.</p><p>She stared at the screen until Agatha’s name disappeared. And the screen got filled with the photo Agatha had sent this morning. The photo that made her heart race this morning. The photo Rio had been looking at earlier.</p><p>That was when she hurried to lock it and put it face down on. Ignoring the buzz of two messages arriving at the same time.</p><p>And as the two hours passed, the buzzing continued.</p><p>She reached with her hand, to her side, expecting her fingers to touch her phone but she knocked over the bottle of vodka instead. </p><p>It fell and shattered into pieces.</p><p>The sound made her flinch and gasp.</p><p>Her eyes flew open as her heart pounded in her chest.</p><p>She propped herself up on her arms. The room spun and her head throbbed brutally.</p><p>Rio struggled to lift her weight, but she managed to roll and lay on her back eventually. </p><p>Staring at the ceiling constantly moving. Spinning. </p><p>A buzz.</p><p>Then stillness.</p><p>This time, she reached her phone. Tried to look at the time but the numbers blurred. She powered it off and set it beside her lying body on the mattress.</p><p>What was there to be said?</p><p>Though it pained her...</p><p>The thought of Agatha struggling to sleep because of her.</p><p>The thought of Agatha waiting for her to respond. Expecting her to.</p><p>She closed her eyes, and gave in.</p><p>Allowed herself to get pulled. To sink.</p><p>Allowed herself not to think. Just for a few hours.</p><hr/><p>Rio gasped for air and her eyes flew open. Feeling her heart tightening in her chest. The headache was plaguing her and every time she inhaled she felt the weight of the air inside her lungs. Heavy and suffocating.</p><p>Rio placed her palms on the bed, leaned on them for support and lifted her upper body up.</p><p>The moment she sat up she heard her bones cracking, as if all of her pain had multiplied like bacteria. </p><p>What infected her mentally now infected her <em>whole</em>.</p><p>She blinked through the dark room expecting to see something, but what was dark remained as it was. Dark.</p><p>Her body was radiating heat, sweating constantly. Feeling how sore her throat was. Dry as a fucking desert. But the worst of it all, was her heart and its rapid pounding.</p><p>As she started recalling again, tears threatened to fall. And they dared to do so.</p><p>Hot and wretched. Falling down from her eyes, resting on her jaw or dripping onto the sheets. Leaving flames in their wake. </p><p>She felt pathetic. She felt like she didn't even deserve pity.</p><p>Feeling hollow, unable to even swallow her gasps.</p><p>Her fist rested on her chest feeling how hard her heart was beating in her hold.</p><p>And honest to god, she didn't even know why she was feeling that way.</p><p>Was it something specific or all of it?</p><p>Was it what she saw or the fact that she was already thinking of pretending it didn't happen?</p><p>But what she was supposed to pretend didn't happen?</p><p>The few hours ago? </p><p>Or Agatha?</p><p>As if she could even pretned either of those things didn't happen.</p><p>Rio didn't even bother wiping her tears away. She placed her feet on the floor and stood up.</p><p>The moment she took a step forward, a piece of glass pierced her foot. The puzzle of pain now got complete.</p><p>She felt it faintly, her brow furrowed as a reaction and her tears were already falling down, but she didn't really care. </p><p>She sat back down on the bed, throwing her weight on it then she pulled the piece of glass out and threw it with the others. It clinked through the darkness as it striked another shard. Making Rio flinch again.</p><p>And she got up and walked to the bathroom, drops of blood fell on the floor every time she lifted her feet up to take a step forward.</p><p>The sound of water dripping from the faucet down to the sink got louder and more irritating with every step she took. Joining the ticking sound in her head.</p><p>Two drops fell down as she opened the door.</p><p><em>Drip</em>. <em>Drip</em>.</p><p>The bright light was a lot for her eyes to handle, so she narrowed them and stepped inside. The place was whirling.</p><p>Her warm feet touched the cold grey and white ceramic tile. </p><p>A half-smoked cigarette sat on the toilet seat, waiting to be smoked to the butt.</p><p>Another step, and the dripping never stopped.</p><p>Standing in front of the mirror and staring at herself. Her eyelashes were still glistening with remains of the humiliating tears.</p><p>Rio grabbed the sink with both of her hands. Her knuckles started to turn white as she widened her eyes and just stared forward.</p><p>Like a woeful drama movie protagonist in a piteous and cliché scene.</p><p>“You have your life and your job, stick to those. You don't deserve her, Rio. She's way too good and that's why you can't have her.” She whispered to her reflection, but the sound echoed, as if it was repeating the words for her to hang on, to remember.</p><p>Did Agatha put her robe on without tying it, or did she tie it as she adjusted it?</p><p>Did that brunette tie it up for her or untied it?</p><p>Did she cling onto Agatha’s shoulders or hang on her for support?</p><p>The thoughts gnawed at her again and again.</p><p>She didn't even know what she saw. What happened and what didn't.</p><p>If she couldn't trust her own eyes, then what the fuck could she trust?</p><p>Another drip. And she lost it all.</p><p>“God, just fucking shut up!”</p><p>It was the scene when she should be breaking the mirror with her fist now out of desperation. Out of feeling pathetic.</p><p>But Rio only reached and turned the water on, letting it fall down. The sound of the cascading was more soothing than the dripping. Because it was the whole thing and not just a little piece of it.</p><p>She put her hand under the water as it got warmer and warmer with every passing second.</p><p>She filled her palm and started splashing it on her face several times.</p><p>She stood straight and looked at her reflection again. Water dripped down from her face onto the floor.</p><p>Rio turned the water off tightly, and stood there for a few seconds until she made sure it was closed and no dripping was there to be heard.</p><p>She took the half-smoked cigarette and turned on her heels.</p><p>She almost slipped and fell down, but her grip on the sink helped her not to collapse. She looked down and bright red blood was taking a path from the threshold to where she was standing.</p><p>“What the fuck.”</p><p>She put the cigarette between her lips and lifted her leg up. Her foot was still bleeding.</p><p>The moment she saw it with her eyes, she felt the sharpness of the pain immediately. As if it wasn't there, and her eyes summoned it.</p><p>Rio lifted her leg on the sink and started washing the blood away, watching it as it mixed with the water and its color got lighter.</p><p>She put her leg down on the floor, took out some band-aids, and stuck two of them down. Then she got going with washing the blood away from the bathroom floor.</p><p>Once she finished, she lit the cigarette and got out. Smoking it while walking, still bare from head to toes.</p><p>The hallway was dark, no source of light was there but the light from the almost spent-out cigarette.</p><p>Rio opened the door of the indoor garden, stood in the threshold, and just stared at the space. The moonlight was taking its turn to illuminate the place through the ceiling-to-floor windows. Rio leaned in as she stubbed the cigarette in the jamb and flipped the switch on. A few white light bulbs came to life, designed on the walls to hang above some selected plants.</p><p>She dimmed the light and stood there, looking.</p><p>Inhaling in the clean, fresh air. Looking at how beautiful and healing all of this was. Her sanctuary.</p><p>Until the memory of being kissed and devoured by Agatha’s mouth right here took over her.</p><p>When they were too drunk as they got back from one of their dates. When they kissed all the way up as they stumbled up the stairs.</p><p>They were too deep in to even open the right door. To realize what room they were in. To even remember why they got upstairs in the first place.</p><p>And they didn't care when they knew and realized and remembered. </p><p>Agatha pushed Rio inside as she <em>frenched</em> her. She shoved her tongue inside Rio’s mouth and didn't even give her a moment to breathe. Agatha stopped Rio’s hands before they rested on her hips and intertwined their hands by their sides as she swallowed Rio’s mouth down.</p><p>She pulled back slightly and looked into Rio’s eyes.</p><p>“<em>That's why I didn't finish my dessert, baby.</em>”</p><p>She said, the alcohol lingering in her breath hit Rio’s already parted lips.</p><p>Agatha pulled her hands from Rio’s hold and rested them on her hips. She lifted her up and sat her down on the dresser filled with several pots of plants. She didn't even wait to lay her down on the couch a few steps away, let alone going to the bedroom.</p><p>“You looked so good all night,” she leaned in and planted an open-mouthed kiss to Rio’s swollen lips. “<em>Holy fucking shit.</em>”</p><p>Their breaths were hot against each other. And Rio felt like her heart would explode right then and there.</p><p>As Agatha stood between her legs, she felt hands drifting under her red dress, palming her thighs with intention.</p><p>“You drive me fucking wild, you know? I don't even know how I managed not to fuck you on that table.” </p><p>Her hands went higher as she pulled down Rio’s ruined underwear deliberately. She kept kissing her until the piece of fabric was out of Rio’s legs.</p><p>Agatha pulled her head back slightly as her finger started massaging the throbbing clit softly. And Rio arched her back forward as a shiver ran down her spine.</p><p>“You kept looking at me like <em>that</em> all the fucking night. Teasing me on purpose by swaying your hips and bending your perfect ass in front of me like that. <em>Uh mon cœur</em>.”</p><p>Two of her fingers slid inside Rio’s drenched heat, and she thrusted them slowly and deeply.</p><p>Rio’s hand went to the side of the dresser as she tried to find the edges of it to hold onto. She closed her eyes, Agatha’s fingers maintained the slow, deep pace, their chests were heaving, and her hands were still searching.</p><p>The sound of a clay pot breaking into pieces filled her ears, but the reason why Rio opened her eyes again was Agatha’s commanding voice landing straight on her ears.</p><p>“Open your eyes. I want you to keep your eyes open when you cum on my fingers. Look at me, Rio, and <em>nothing but me</em>.”</p><p>Rio blinked several times in an attempt to chase the memory away, but a shiver ran down her spine and she was affected by it all immediately. But she dismissed it.</p><p>She had to.</p><p>She stepped outside and closed the door.</p><p>Resting her back on it as she tried calming her heart down.</p><p>Rio got downstairs.</p><p>The house was still. Not a sound at all except the ticking of the clock hanging on the wall in the living room and the hum of the fridge in the kitchen.</p><p>And almost all the lights were off.</p><p>Rio walked forward, opened the fridge, and stared at the cans and bottles of beers lining up, the light inside illuminating her exhausted features as the fridge's cold air sent shivers down her spine, making her regret not putting some clothes on.</p><p>She passed everything in there and only picked the chocolate milk that she told Agatha to buy a few days ago.</p><p>She opened the container and gulped as she closed the fridge with her foot and walked to the living room. She picked up the blanket that was draping on the armrest and wrapped her body with it. </p><p>She lay down, staring at the ceiling that she wasn't able to see anything of because of the darkness. Drinking the milk and letting its sweet taste linger. As the ticking of the clock continued.</p><p>The sound held nostalgia.</p><p>As if the clock itself held Rio’s childhood inside.</p><p>That same clock that was hanging on the wall of the living room she spent her best memories in. The same sound that ticked in her ears as she went back to the empty house to gather the stuff she considered as extremely important. The same old clock that she didn't know how its battery stayed alive for a long time. The clock she used to go down to the basement in her aunt’s house only to listen to its ticking because it was soothing. And it was one of the few things she took with her to the first apartment she had ever rented with Alice.</p><p>Back then, her future looked way different than the present now. The potential everyone saw in her faded as the years went by, and the ticking stayed as it is.</p><p>Rio stared and kept on doing so, until the sound lulled her to sleep. Pulled her into an orbit of a ticking nostalgia.</p><p><em>Tick-tock. Tick-tock.</em></p><hr/><p>“Rio, hey,”</p><p>She heard her name being called softly, almost a whisper melting into her ear.</p><p>“Can you wake up?”</p><p>She stirred and rolled to her other side, her hands were tucked under her head.</p><p>“Baby, please.” </p><p>A hand gently touched her forehead. It was so soft on her skin.</p><p>“Fuck, you're burning. Can you just open your eyes for me? Please. Look at me.”</p><p>She rolled again, clenching the blanket tightly around her body. Rio inhaled deeply and Agatha’s scent hit her senses instantly.</p><p>She smiled briefly as she felt a strange sensation of comfort, until she realized and opened her eyes.</p><p>Agatha was sitting on her knees by the couch, looking at her. Her hand reached up and tucked a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear.</p><p>The touch was so soft and gentle.</p><p>Agatha’s cold palm resting on her burning skin. </p><p>Rio closed her eyes again as the overwhelming sensations took over her. Tears threatened to fall, because the sight of Agatha made her heart pound in her chest. It was suffocating.</p><p>And she knew this wasn't a dream, because nothing—<em>nothing</em>—could make her heart tighten in her chest like the real sight of Agatha.</p><p>Her tired features. Her beautiful blue eyes staring at Rio, holding the world for her to take.</p><p>The back of her hand brushed Rio’s face softly.</p><p>Agatha smiled, and god, those beautiful smile lines.</p><p>“<em>Hi.</em>”</p><p>Her voice landed on Rio’s ears, and how she wished to be one with the couch she was lying on.</p><p>She felt helpless, unable to move. So she just opened her eyes again.</p><p>Their eyes locked as a single tear fell down, and Agatha brushed it immediately.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Rio asked, her voice wad barely above a whisper. But it was a whisper shared between them, sounding louder than what it actually was from how close their faces were. </p><p>How it ached Rio to see those beautiful eyes tired like this. Thinking that she might be the reason behind.</p><p>Agatha’s hand continued to brush her skin soothingly. The touches were so delicate, tracing her face with care.</p><p>“I thought something bad happened to you,” Agatha whispered, as if she was still in disbelief.</p><p>“How are you here, Agatha?” Rio's voice was still thick with sleep, blending with the soft hum of the morning.</p><p>The headache was killing her. Feeling nerves pounding in her head as thoughts struggled to find a place to settle. Her head was already filled and would soon overflow.</p><p>“You told me to come back, didn't you?” </p><p>Their eyes remained locked. And Rio was leaning into the touch. Feeling her body melting under it. Feeling her body getting colder because of Agatha’s touch—or maybe Agatha was getting warmer because of Rio's fever.</p><p>Either way, she felt as if Agatha’s fingers were always there brushing her skin. Always there to soothe her.</p><p>“You didn't answer any of my calls or messages, Rio. I was terrified.” Agatha’s eyes left hers, her gaze drifted down to Rio’s parted, dry lips for a second. “Baby, I don't know what you saw. But it's not what you think it is.” She looked back at Rio's eyes.</p><p>And another warm tear fell down, tickling Rio's skin.</p><p>Rio inhaled deeply, taking Agatha’s scent in again. And god, how she smelled like home. </p><p>“I swear to you.”</p><p>Rio sat up, clenching the blanket tightly from the middle and letting it drape on her shoulders. Agatha stayed there on her knees, looking up at her.</p><p>“What was she doing with you?”</p><p>“She's my friend. I told you about her.” </p><p>One of Agatha’s hands rested on Rio’s knee. A shiver ran down Rio's spine as she looked down at Agatha.</p><p>Though her sense wasn't in her head, and her jealousy was almost taking over her.</p><p>“A friend you fuck, apparently.” </p><p>“No. No. Don't talk like that. She was drunk and happy because she got engaged. I didn't even know she had the key to the room,” Agatha explained. Although her voice rose slightly, it remained soft and her thumb continued brushing Rio’s knee above the fabric. “And I've never slept with her if that's what you're thinking about. I don't fuck every woman around me. Though... I know why you might have this idea, but I really don't, Rio.”</p><p>Rio looked at her.</p><p>Her head now got inundated with thoughts.</p><p>She saw it all wrong didn't she? </p><p>She got sensitive again. Ruined everything with her vulnerability and weakness, didn't she?</p><p>She fucked things up because she was drunk, again. Just like the uncountable times before over the years.</p><p>“Why…” Rio swallowed, blinking a tear away. “Did you…”</p><p>“Say anything you want. Anything. Please. Just don't keep it inside. Tell me, yeah?”</p><p>Tears fell down.</p><p>Fast, hot, and exposing.</p><p>Because why the hell Agatha was so tender? Did she not feel how fast Rio’s heart was racing? Couldn't she hear it? Wasn't it loud and disturbing all the morning’s stillness?</p><p>Wasn't she mad because Rio treated her awfully?</p><p>Agatha rested her other hand on Rio’s other knee, encouraging her to go on while still looking up at her. </p><p>Rio lifted one of her hands and brushed the tears away with the back of her hand, then rested it on one of Agatha’s hands.</p><p>And the words got out. Although she knew she shouldn't talk about this. Not like this. Not now. But the thoughts were plaguing her since yesterday. Since what Alice had told her. The words that caused all of this internal havoc, dragging Agatha in with her because she was too weak to even deal with it herself.</p><p>“When… you were with Wanda…”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes briefly as she squeezed Rio’s knee. Then she opened them and nodded for Rio to go on.</p><p>And god how awful Rio felt at that moment. Looking at Agatha’s eyes made her feel guilty. And she was.</p><p>How could she treat such tenderness with cruelty?</p><p>Why would she stab someone else when she was the one who caused herself to bleed?</p><p>“Why is she walking around talking shit about you? Did you really... cheat on her? </p><p>“I did. Yes.” Agatha’s hold tightened. “With many women, and I admit that, Rio. Because I did it, and it's true. Nothing would ever change that.”</p><p>She squeezed Rio’s knee gently one more time then she rose on her feet.</p><p>Agatha ran a hand through her dark hair and chose to sit on the couch facing Rio and not on the same one beside her—which made Rio look at her with the slightest hint of a pout on her lips.</p><p>She clenched the blanket again. Tighter.</p><p>Agatha sat down with a loud sigh. As if her body collapsed on the piece of furniture.</p><p>She sat, spreading her feet and putting her hands together in front of her. Her hair was falling down on her face as she leaned forward slightly.</p><p>Wearing that white sheer shirt, her cleavage was on display. A hint of her pale skin and the black bra she was wearing were obvious through the fabric.</p><p>“The difference between us is that she cheated with the same woman over and over again, and now they're together. She still doesn't know that I know, that's why she can walk around and act like a victim. 'Til now she acts like I was the <em>only</em> troubled bitch. Like I'm some kind of a monster. I was bad, yes. Hell, I was even the goddamn worst. But I wasn't the only one in that relationship, Rio.” Agatha ran a furious hand through her hair and straightened her posture.</p><p>“I know it sounds awful. I know it makes me look small in your eyes. But it's true, and that's why that relationship didn't work out. It was never going to work out. Wanda was fucking miserable. She had an art block for years, and couldn't do anything at all. So what did she do? She started acting like a housewife, even though I never asked her to. I always wanted her to <em>at least</em> push herself. To find something that would truly help her, but she didn't. <em>Christ</em>, how she insisted on playing that role, until she turned it out on me. Like I was the one who forced her.” Agatha chuckled mockingly, then she exhaled a deep breath. “As much as I hate to admit that to you, Rio—but yes, I did. I slept with many women when I was with her. And I didn't even act secretive about it. I <em>wanted</em> her to find out.”</p><p>Their eyes locked.</p><p>And silence stretched between them for a long minute.</p><p>“You've been thinking about that while I was gone? Thinking that I would cheat? On you?”</p><p>Rio got up from her place. The fabric only hung on her body, she didn't bother adjusting it this time.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Oh god…” Agatha heavily sighed.</p><p>Though Rio didn't know if it was because of her admission, or because of how she was walking toward her.</p><p>“It's not that I don't trust you… it's really not. It's just… <em>me</em>.”</p><p>Agatha looked her up and down.</p><p>“I trust you with my life, Agatha,” She said as she approached her.</p><p>Rio deliberately sat down, putting her knees on the floor one by one while looking at Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>She was kneeling in front of her, looking up at her.</p><p>“I'm sorry.” Rio whispered. Her hands were moving up and down Agatha’s legs.</p><p>“I'm sorry 'cause I acted like that. 'Cause I ignored you and terrified you. Because I forced you to come back here and acted like a child. I'm sorry I didn't even trust you. Because... I was stupid and too weak to even control myself and... see. I couldn't even see <em>you.</em>”</p><p>“Don't talk about yourself like that.”</p><p>Agatha cupped her face, her thumb was brushing her skin softly.</p><p>“You're too good to me. I don't deserve you.”</p><p>Agatha’s thumb drifted to Rio’s bottom lip as she leaned in closer.</p><p>“Of course you deserve me, Rio. How can I make you see yourself in my eyes?”</p><p>Brushing it softly. Rio’s lips parted.</p><p>“I told you to take, didn't I? Because you deserve the whole world, and not just me.”</p><p>“You're the whole world to me.”</p><p>Agatha smirked as she leaned her face even closer.</p><p>She parted Rio’s lips widely with her thumb, and their eyes locked.</p><p>“Good. Because I want you to see only me.”</p><p>Rio hummed a warm hum against Agatha’s thumb as it entered her mouth. She kept moving her hands up and down Agatha’s legs. Feeling her body getting warmer.</p><p>Heat was only increasing as Agatha kept looking at her.</p><p>“Did you hurt yourself?” Agatha asked, looking Rio in the eyes.</p><p>Rio shook her head as she felt Agatha’s thumb teasing her tongue.</p><p>“Then why was there glass and blood in your room, hmm?”</p><p>Rio didn't say a thing, but her hands stilled.</p><p>“I want you to promise me to quit drinking like that. I don't want you to hurt yourself. I can't allow you to do that to yourself, Rio.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her head was foggy. Filled with Agatha.</p><p>Agatha took her thumb out.</p><p>The faint sound of a <em>pop</em> filled the few inches between thier faces.</p><p>“Say it.”</p><p>“I promise.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in and finally kissed her.</p><p>Their mouths crashed. Their tongues collided and intertwined.</p><p>Rio lifted her hands up and grabbed the collar of Agatha’s shirt, making her lean in closer, as Agatha moved the blanket off Rio’s shoulders and let it fall down behind her. </p><p>She tilted her head slightly to the side, deepening the kiss as deep as possible.</p><p>The sound of their sucking filled the space. Ringing in the ears.</p><p>“<em>I missed you. I missed your mouth. I missed you.</em>” Rio whispered between kisses. </p><p>Agatha put her hand in Rio’s hair and pulled her head back, breaking the kiss, and exposing her neck. </p><p>Rio tried to breathe, but she didn't have the time. Agatha started licking and sucking her pulse point. Her moans got louder and her sighs became warmer and heavier.</p><p>Agatha nipped her earlobe.</p><p>“<em>Get up,</em>” she said into her ear, and Rio obliged immediately. </p><p>She stood between Agatha’s spread legs.</p><p>Agatha’s hand flew and landed on both of Rio’s ass cheeks, and she grabbed them as she pulled Rio more toward her.</p><p>Their pupils were dilated with lust, and their chests were rising and falling from the lack of air.</p><p>“I want you to trust me. I need you to.”</p><p>“I do. I trust you.”</p><p>“Because you're all I think about, Rio.”</p><p>“You're all I want to think about, Agatha. So make me forget it all. I want only you.”</p><p>Rio bit her bottom lip as she looked down at Agatha looking up at her.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes drifted down to take Rio’s body in.</p><p>Every curve. Every freckle. Every mole. Every stretch mark. Every scar. Taking all of it in. Looking at her body and <em>seeing</em> her through it.</p><p>Agatha looked up at Rio's face again and slowly got up, brushing Rio’s body with the back of her hands as she did so.</p><p>They were standing, facing each other.</p><p>Devouring each other with their eyes.</p><p>Agatha rested her hands on Rio’s hips.</p><p>“I'll fuck it all out of your head if you let me.”</p><p>She leaned in and kissed her collarbones. Rio moaned softly into the air.</p><p>“<em>Don't ask my permission to do that.”</em></p><p>Agatha turned their bodies, making them take each other’s places.</p><p>Her mouth crushed into Rio’s again, kissing her deeply as she walked forward. When the back of Rio's legs hit the couch, she pushed her slowly on it.</p><p>Agatha pulled back and took her shirt off, followed by her bra, and remained in her oversized black sweatpants.</p><p>Rio swallowed as Agatha leaned in again and kissed her. </p><p>Kissing every inch of her neck as her hand found Rio’s heat. Rio’s face reddened as a loud uncontrolled moan escaped her throat.</p><p>Agatha pulled back slightly, pulling Rio’s bottom lip with her teeth, thrusting two of her fingers slowly inside, as her other hand played with Rio’s hard nipple.</p><p>“Good fuck, how I love it when you get this wet for me. <em>Drenched</em> for me.”</p><p>“I only get this wet for you,” Rio breathed out as she closed her eyes, feeling Agatha’s fingers inside her.</p><p>“Good girl,”</p><p>“Oh, <em>fuck</em>.”</p><p>“Open your mouth.”</p><p>Rio opened her half-lidded eyes as she obliged. Opening her mouth and sticking her tongue out. </p><p>Agatha leaned in, spitting on her tongue.</p><p>“<em>Swallow</em>,” She pinched Rio’s nipple.</p><p>Rio obliged with a broken moan. Swallowing Agatha in.</p><p>“You look so beautiful like this.”</p><p>Agatha increased her pace. Started pumping in and out, making Rio scream her lungs out every time her fingers hit her g-spot.</p><p>“<em>Oh god. Oh god. Oh god!</em>”</p><p>Rio clung into Agatha’s hips. Her hands were resting on the waistband of her sweatpants.</p><p>“<em>Fuck me like you've never fucked anyone before me.</em>”</p><p>A third joined the other two, and Agatha started rubbing Rio’s clit with her other hand. Rio’s hips started jerking upward desperately, her moans turned into hot, deep groans.</p><p>Agatha’s teeth were biting on her bottom lip so hard, blood was threatening to drip.</p><p>“<em>You're mine.</em>”</p><p>Rio's orgasm tore through her as she came on Agatha’s fingers. Screaming out her name as pleasure flooded her whole. Arching her back forward and digging her nails into Agatha’s hips with all her might.</p><p>“<em>Yours.</em>”</p><p>Agatha leaned her face again and took Rio’s lips between her teeth as she continued fucking her through the aftershocks, triggering another orgasm.</p><p>“I only think of you, Rio Vidal. I want you to keep that in your mind and never forget it, the same way you can't forget how my fingers feel inside you. The same way you crave kissing me. The same way you keep staring at my fucking nose. I want you to know that I only think of you, no matter who the hell is around me or where the fuck I am<em>.</em>” She said the words in Rio's mouth.</p><p>Their hot unsteady breaths were mingling. </p><p>“Cum for me.”</p><p>Rio’s body shuddered as Agatha pulled another orgasm out of it. Hot and intense.</p><p>And Agatha kept thrusting,</p><p>“<em>Oh fuck it. Fuck, Agatha I'm gonna cum again, please, baby.</em>”</p><p>“Go on, do it.” </p><p>Agatha said as she stood straight.</p><p>She then sat on her knees, as she took her fingers out momentarily, and pulled Rio’s body toward the edge of the couch by the hips.</p><p>She spread her legs widely and looked down at Rio’s glistening cunt. Drenched and swollen and still clenching constantly though Agatha’s fingers left her heat seconds ago.</p><p>“You can give me a few more, right, angel?”</p><p>Rio’s chest rose and fell heavily. Her face was flushed red, her eyes were half-lidded, her pupils were blown widely, and she was constantly swallowing.</p><p>“Yes. God, anything for you. Take me.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. She put her palms on Rio’s thighs and lifted her body up, bringing Rio in with a kiss.</p><p>“Attagirl,” She pressed a soft peck and sat down again.</p><p>The moment Agatha’s warm breath hit her cunt, Rio jerked her hips upward. So Agatha took her legs and rested them on her shoulders.</p><p>“Grab that pillow and put it under your back,” she said before pulling Rio toward her, making only her upper body lie there. She started kissing and nipping the soft flesh of the inside of her thighs.</p><p>Rio did as she was told, and she moaned loudly the moment Agatha started licking the length of her slit.</p><p>“<em>Please, Agatha, please.</em>” Rio pleaded, not even knowing what she was pleading for as her tanned skin glistened with sweat.</p><p>Agatha started teasing Rio’s entrance with her tongue, pushing only the tip of it inside. Then she moved up to tease her throbbing clit. And Rio’s moans only got louder and more desperate as the hot knots in her stomach kept tying up around themselves.</p><p>Agatha pulled Rio more toward her and pushed her face in, as she kept licking her softly. <em>Agonizingly</em>.</p><p>Until she wasn't—the length of her tongue started licking and sucking on purpose. Her nose was pumping into Rio constantly.</p><p>The sounds were blaring and obscene, not fitting with the sereneness of the morning. </p><p>But honestly? Fuck the morning from its roots. Let the sounds of their uncontrollable lust replace the chirping of the birds.</p><p>“I'm so close…”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth continued devouring her out. </p><p>Until Rio came into it.</p><p>Agatha licked every drop of her, the mixed taste of saltiness and sweetness filled her mouth as the strong smell of Rio hung on her nose. Rio’s body was trembling uncontrollably, begging Agatha to stop—or maybe encouraging her to keep going.</p><p>But Agatha didn't stop until the fourth got pulled out of Rio’s body.</p><p>Rio crashed out on the couch, trying to stabilize her breaths. Feeling herself inhaling through her mouth and nose and still not getting enough air.</p><p>Agatha took her legs and placed them down gently. Then she got up and adjusted Rio’s body so she wouldn't hurt herself.</p><p>As she placed her legs on the end of the couch, she saw the blood through the band-aids that were stuck one above the other—what Rio thought was an X at the time. What a loser.</p><p>Agatha leaned in and brushed her foot gently with her finger, and Rio pulled her leg at the same moment.</p><p>“Hey! It tickles,” She protested, still struggling to breathe.</p><p>Agatha smiled at her. Then she sat beside Rio's legs. She started kissing a path of Rio’s body, from her toes and going up until her hands rested on both sides of Rio’s head, caging it.</p><p>Her body was a few inches from lying completely on Rio’s and she looked down at her.</p><p>“I'm so exhausted right now I could sleep for eternity, but I also want you to eat me out.”</p><p>Rio lifted her hands up and cupped Agatha’s breasts.</p><p>“I won't let you sleep for an eternity unless I would be there with you. And…” She rolled a nipple between her fingers as her other hand moved and landed on Agatha’s ass. “I would gladly eat you out because I'm starving. Just take those off.” </p><p>Their eyes locked.</p><p>“Why don't you take them off yourself?” </p><p>Rio’s hand moved deliberately, until it rested on the waistband of Agatha's sweatpants.</p><p>Agatha clicked her tongue.</p><p>“No, baby, I want you to use those beautiful, strong teeth of yours to strip me down.”</p><p>Rio lifted her head up and almost caught Agatha’s bottom lip between her teeth.</p><p>But Agatha pulled back slightly as she slid her leg between Rio’s, and Rio whimpered from the sudden friction.</p><p>“<em>Oh, she bites.</em>” She moved her leg slightly, causing Rio to sigh heavily.</p><p>“I just want to show you how strong my teeth are.” Rio pouted, looking up at Agatha with her half-lidded eyes.</p><p>“Mhm,” Agatha hummed. “Show that to me upstairs,”</p><p>“I… I didn't clean the room, so let's stay here for now.”</p><p>“I cleaned it. Get up.”</p><p>“What? What time did you get here then?”</p><p>“Two hours ago. I tried to wake you up but…”</p><p>“<em>I'm sorry,</em>”</p><p>“What are you apologizing for, angel?”</p><p>“All of it. You're exhausted and it's all because of me.”</p><p>“Don't. It's not because of you. And what, I don't look as beautiful when I'm exhausted?” Agatha smirked.</p><p>“You're always beautiful. <em>Always</em>.”</p><p>“I see. Come on now before I collapse on you,” Agatha said as she took her hands away and sat down, giving the space for Rio to do the same. </p><p>They got upstairs, Agatha’s hand was resting on Rio’s ass the entire time.</p><p>Once they stepped inside the room, Agatha voiced,</p><p>“Don't keep your boxers on the bed next time. It's distracting.”</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio whined.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Your... nipples are distracting.” Rio pointed her fingers at her.</p><p>Agatha looked down at her breasts, then back up at Rio with a wicked, knowing smirk.</p><p>“Oh, I know. I also know you want my breasts shoved down your throat.”</p><p>Rio stood facing Agatha, a blush creeping up her face.</p><p>“<em>I do</em>.”</p><p>She leaned her head down and closed her mouth around Agatha’s breast and Agatha’s hand immediately flew up to her hair and pushed Rio’s head in.</p><p>“Mhm, so good to me, aren’t you?” The words left her mouth the moment Rio bit her nipple.</p><p>Agatha clicked her tongue as she tightened her hold in Rio’s hair and pulled her head back.</p><p>“So you're determined to use your teeth?”</p><p>“You said I bite, and I’m proving it.”</p><p>“So what are you, a bad or a good dog?”</p><p>“Always good for you.”</p><p>Agatha smirked as she started pushing Rio’s head down until she sat kneeling in front of her. Looking up at her.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were half-opened from exhaustion and her lips were curled up into a smirk.</p><p>“Then behave.” </p><p>Rio nodded eagerly.</p><p>She put her hands on Agatha’s legs and started moving them up and down above the fabric.</p><p>“Hands down. Use your teeth.”</p><p>Rio lifted up her body slightly and grabbed the waistband of Agatha’s sweatpants with her teeth, starting to pull it down. She struggled a bit because of how wide the elastic was, but she did it gradually.</p><p>Pulling it down from Agatha’s hips, to her thighs, down to her shins until the fabric pooled around her ankles, and Agatha stepped out of them the next second.</p><p>“Look at me.” </p><p>Rio looked up, waiting for any command Agatha was about to say. Eager to please. To show that she could be good and behave. Because it was nagging inside her head somewhere, the fact that she treated Agatha awfully.</p><p>Agatha held her chin between her fingers.</p><p>“Good job. Now get up.”</p><p>Rio stood on her feet, and Agatha kissed the front row of Rio’s teeth before she crushed their mouths in a messy kiss. All teeths and tongues and spit.</p><p>She held Rio’s hand and walked to the bed.</p><p>Agatha lay down on the pillows as Rio kissed her way from Agatha’s forehead, down to pressing soft kisses on Agatha’s cunt above the fabric before she started taking her underwear off with her teeth.</p><p>Once the fabric was out of her legs and thrown somewhere, Agatha spread her legs widely for Rio. </p><p>Rio sat between them and inhaled deeply. Taking all of Agatha in.</p><p>She stuck out her tongue and licked her softly.</p><p>“If I teased you before, it doesn't mean you can do it now,”</p><p>Rio looked up at her with a pout. “I wasn't intending to.”</p><p>“Oh, you're behaving so good.”</p><p>Rio smiled and leaned her mouth down again.</p><p>After a few licks with the length of her tongue, Rio was sucking on Agatha, making her moan deeply and breath heavily.</p><p>“<em>Fuck, Rio. So good, so fucking good. Don't stop.</em>”</p><p>And she didn't stop even after Agatha came—her hips jerked up and her body shuddered. She stopped only after pulling another intense orgasm out of Agatha’s system.</p><p>She licked the remains of Agatha off the edges of her mouth. Her lips were glistining with her. Filled with her taste.</p><p>“Come here,” Agatha said, offering her hand for Rio to hold. </p><p>Rio held it and crawled up. They kissed a lazy and a messy kiss.</p><p>Then she rested her head on Agatha’s chest and Agatha was brushing her hair softly.</p><p>When the movements stilled, Rio lifted her head up and saw Agatha sleeping. Her lips were slightly parted, her hair was falling down on her face. And god, her nose. </p><p>She stayed like that for a few minutes, lying under the covers beside Agatha’s sleeping body, and just... looking at her.</p><p>Then Rio got up, deliberately not to disturb Agatha. She got out of bed, almost tiptoeing.</p><p>She put some clothes on and leaned in to kiss Agatha softly.</p><p>Rio grabbed her phone and laptop and got out, after pulling the door and leaving a slightly opened gap out of habit.</p><p>She got downstairs and headed to the kitchen. She put her stuff on the counter, and without even realizing it, her eyes started to water the moment she saw the coffee and the box of donuts setting beside it.</p><p>She felt awful. Because god, how could she do something like that? How could she treat her like that? Think of her like that?</p><p>Blaming it on the alcohol wouldn't make her a better person, it would just make her look as awful to herself. Because nothing would ever justify it. And no amount of I'm sorrys could ease those feelings.</p><p>She wiped the few tears away.</p><p>Rio sat on the couch, laptop opened in front of her, her face was illuminated by its light. She sipped the coffee even if it was cold.</p><p>With a promise floating inside her head.</p><p><em>She will do better.</em></p>

<p align="left">when a mother loses her child, the pain she'd feel would be double—worse than the pain she felt during labor. During giving birth, while witnessing her entrails being cut. She'd feel the pain mentally. Her head would bleed constantly. And the child would be swallowed by the head rather than pushed from the womb.</p><p align="left">The little body ceased to exist, but the memories still exist. Haunting, horrifying, as sharp as a butcher’s knife, constantly cutting flesh. Constantly munching with bloody teeth.</p><p align="left">But what does it feel like when a child loses the mother?</p><p align="left">When a child loses the connection to the world?</p><p align="left">When the soil is nowhere to be spotted and the plant is lying, petals torn, and the roots don't have a place to plant themselves in? Don't have the ability to grow?</p><p align="left">Not feeling alive.</p><p align="left">A child would feel like they had never lived, and yet, their body is still carrying the memories of a life that once had been lived. Memories that don't feel real at all, but they're there. Gnawing, feeding on the misery.</p><p align="left">When a child loses their mother, they would feel like their coronary arteries are cut off, no blood reaching their heart. The heart won't be pounding. The body won't be functioning. But the brain would still be there, no blood reaching it, but still functioning on the misery of the memories. Squeezes the sorrow and quenches its thirst with it.</p><p align="left">Then, would it matter to find the lost piece of the puzzle when there is no longer a board to place it on?</p><p align="left">Would it matter to reach the water when you feel like a fish, thrown on the island, thrashing?</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“The court finds the defendant not guilty.” </p><p align="left">The words landed on Rio’s ears.</p><p align="left">“Court is adjourned.”</p><p align="left">And the one single bang of the judge’s gavel banged in her head. Rang in her ears—then silence followed.</p><p align="left">The entire place looked like a TV that just got turned on and the only thing Rio was able to hear was the static noise. Everyone around her looked like the tiny black dots, surrounding her and floating in front of her eyes.</p><p align="left">The lawyer beside her embraced her little body with warm hands. Her aunt by her side leaned down to her level. Saying something Rio heard nothing of.</p><p align="left">People cheered behind her, some of them were even crying—relatives and her parents' friends. </p><p align="left">But she wasn't able to hear all that. It was only the buzzing filling her ears.</p><p align="left">They got out of the courtroom, people with poster signs showing their love and support to her and to her case. </p><p align="left">Calling her the little hero.</p><p align="left">Their little hero.</p><p align="left">Cameras flashed on her face once they stepped out of the court building. Microphones almost shoved down her face. Reporters asking questions she wasn't understanding or hearing. Only looking at their mouths moving. Assuming they were shouting.</p><p align="left">She stood there beside her lawyer, the small black dots remained there, and the buzzing blended with the noise of the street.</p><p align="left">The lawyer dismissed them all with a few words, updating them with the bare minimum.</p><p align="left">“Rio, do you have a message to your parents?”</p><p align="left">And she felt herself being pulled. Her eyes were opened widely, voices and sounds sharpened as they blended. Her heart was pounding in her chest.</p><p align="left">The lawyer held Rio’s hand and they walked their way with hurried steps to the black car that was waiting for them.</p><p align="left">Rio felt hollow when the car door got closed. No sound was inside the car but the noise was living in her head.</p><p align="left">Her aunt sighed as she checked if Rio was alright.</p><p align="left">But Rio wasn't alright.</p><p align="left">How could she be?</p><p align="left">Because what did all of this mean? </p><p align="left">Peoples’ words meant nothing. Their reassurance meant nothing. All of it meant nothing.</p><p align="left">Rio wasn't supposed to be here in the first place. She wasn't supposed to witness all that. To live it. To go to a juvenile court. To testify it. To say it out loud. To admit it. To talk about something that didn't feel real. But it was real. Because no matter how hard she tried to pretend it was all an illusion, pictures would show up and fill her head.</p><p align="left">As a punishment of survival. As a reminder of escaping. </p><p align="left">The blood. The murder. The guilt.</p><p align="left">She wasn't supposed to lift this heavy weight on her shoulders. She wasn't ready to handle all of this.</p><p align="left">At this time, a few months ago, she would be back from school, walking into the house that was full of warmth and love. The delicious smell of baking. Of watered plants.</p><p align="left">She would go to the backyard and see her mother, sitting there in the middle, surrounded by the plants they grew together. See her painting a mesmerising view. Kiss her cheek softly. Embrace her and feel the peace and safety that could fit the whole world. She would be eating one of her favorite meals. Sit and talk with her parents about nothing and everything all at once. Talking about her day enthusiastically. Listen to her father talk about the new boat he was building. Feel her cheeks pushed up with a smile the whole time until they start to hurt.</p><p align="left">She was supposed to feel <em>alive</em> at this time. </p><p align="left">But Rio wasn't. For long miserable months, she didn't feel like it. And it only kept getting worse.</p><p align="left">She wasn't listening to the lawyer by her side speaking. Or her aunt talking about the family court, the custody and all. Something about child service meetings and arrangements this week. About how they would get along together.</p><p align="left">But Rio couldn't comprehend anything. She just stared outside the window, looking at the life outside. Thinking about the one that got robbed from her.</p><p align="left">“Okay, honey? You have an appointment with Doctor Sandra tomorrow. Your aunt will drop you off and I will be there.”</p><p align="left">Rio snapped her head to the side. </p><p align="left">“I thought we weren’t going there anymore.” Her voice was so small. So innocent. And filled with pain.</p><p align="left">“Yes, that was two weeks ago, dear,” the lawyer took Rio’s small hand. She wanted to yank her hand free, but she was more focused on what the lawyer was going to say next. “But now, the court required more sessions with Doctor Sandra. Just a few more.”</p><p align="left">“Why do I have to go see her? Why can't I do the sessions with Aunt Teresa? She's a therapist.”</p><p align="left">“Because, love, I can't be involved if I'm going to be your guardian. I told you that.” Her aunt said, turning her face to look at Rio with a soft smile and a sympathetic look on her face.</p><p align="left">And Rio stared at her, the same way she did every time.</p><p align="left">Her aunt looked so much like her mother. She sounded like her. But she wasn't her mother.</p><p align="left">And Rii stared for a longer time after her aunt turned around.</p><p align="left">Because the sound always rang in her ears and blended with her mother’s voice in her head.</p><p align="left">Because the features always mixed in front of her eyes even if they weren’t there.</p><p align="left">Her aunt and mother looked so much alike, almost like identical twins.</p><p align="left">Except the eye color.</p><p align="left">Her aunt’s were dark brown, but her mother’s were the greenest green she had ever seen. The only pair of eyes that embraced her with its softness.</p><p align="left">The pair of eyes she couldn't stare at anymore to find the softness of the whole world living in their irises.</p><p align="left">“I know. But why her?” Rio said after a few heartbeats of silence.</p><p align="left">“You don't like her? Did something happen last time?” The lawyer asked and Rio looked at her. </p><p align="left">“It's… it's not that. She—she asks a lot and I don't like the stuff she gives me.” Rio turned her face back to the window.</p><p align="left">And god how it hurts.</p><p align="left">How it shutters a child.</p><p align="left">To look to the side and see someone their age with their parents beside them. Unharmed and alive.</p><p align="left">How it hurts to be jealous of someone else's happiness.</p><p align="left">How it hurts to lose something you thought you'd keep forever.</p><p align="left">How it hurts to know that you don't deserve.</p><p align="left">It hurts like hell to be thirteen and yearning.</p><p align="left">Yearning for something in a way you don't quite understand yet, but you know without that thing you feel hollow.</p><p align="left">Silence filled the atmosphere between the three of them. Stretching loudly. Because even in silence, everyone's eyes were staring <em>loudly</em> at her.</p><p align="left">And as Rio looked at the street, how she wished they would get into an accident and she'd be the only dead body after, rather than the only survivor.</p><p align="left">Because there was no glory in surviving.</p><p align="left">If survival meant this, Rio didn't want it.</p><p align="left">“Alice will come later to spend the night.” Her aunt turned around briefly to look at her with a wide grin.</p><p align="left">“You like Alice, don't you?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah… she's cool. I like her.”</p><p align="left">And silence stretched again, as her aunt stopped the car to buy her an ice cream. And she bought the vanilla flavored one.</p><p align="left">Rio hated vanilla ice cream.</p><p align="left">She tried eating it, but she couldn't.</p><p align="left">Maybe she was picky. And that made her feel sad, not for herself, but for her aunt because she'd have to deal with her.</p><p align="left">She felt guilty. Rio always did and always will do.</p><p align="left">And the cone was melting on her hand when they arrived at her aunt’s house.</p><p align="left">They got inside.</p><p align="left">And there wasn't any delicious smell of freshly cooked pies or the smell of her favorite meals. </p><p align="left">The place was empty of her parents. This looked nothing like the haven she once lived in—and she was supposed to get used to it. </p><p align="left">This house was empty of home.</p><p align="left">Her parents weren’t there so her home wasn't there. Rio wasn't able to feel home for months.</p><p align="left">As her aunt walked around the house talking about something, Rio threw the ice cream cone and washed her hands in the kitchen sink.</p><p align="left">When she turned around, the lawyer was looking at her, smiling a soft smile.</p><p align="left">Rio’s face stayed as it was as she approached her again.</p><p align="left">But once she lifted up her eyes, they landed on the painting hung in the hallway. The one her mother gifted to her aunt.</p><p align="left">She was there during the process of it, she even helped her mother with it. It was one of her favorites.</p><p align="left">But it started haunting her.</p><p align="left">Other kids were afraid of the monsters under the beds. But thirteen-years-old Rio was afraid of the memories hanging on the walls. The ones living in her head.</p><p align="left">“Do you need anything, Rio? Tell me,” the lawyer asked as she bent down to Rio’s level, putting a long strand of hair behind her ear.</p><p align="left">She tried holding Rio’s hand, but Rio yanked her tiny hand immediately and clenched the necklace around her neck instead.</p><p align="left">“I need my mother,” she said, her voice was barely above a whisper, but it echoed in the empty hallway.</p><p align="left">It echoed and echoed <em>and</em> echoed in her ears on repeat.</p><p align="left">It felt like it won't stop echoing. Won't stop reminding her. Ringing in her ear. The invisible sound vibrations made her ears bleed invisible blood, and yet she, felt it dripping from them.</p><p align="left">Unforgiving and punishing.</p><p align="left">Until the sound it faded.</p><p align="left">“Oh, honey…”</p><p align="left">“Why was I the one the universe picked? Why did it have to happen to <em>me</em>?” Her tears fell down her face.</p><p align="left">Fast and scalding.</p><p align="left">“I did nothing wrong, Miss Viv, why am I being punished?”</p><p align="left">Her hold tightened on the piece of her mother she was able to save as the tears continued to fall down.</p><p align="left">The lawyer stood up and hugged Rio’s little body, and Rio immediately clung to her, wrapping her arms around the woman, burying her face in her abdomen and weeping without a sound.</p><p align="left">“It's not because of you, honey. You did nothing wrong.” The lawyer brushed her hair softly, running her fingers in the long dark locks, trying to soothe her.</p><p align="left">“I’m scared, Miss Viv. What if… what if I can't live without them? My heart is hurting me. I know I shouldn’t have gotten upset because of the stupid marshmallows,” she gasped. Involuntary, her sobs grew louder and louder “I always think about them. <em>Always</em>.” She struggled to breathe. “I should’ve… I should’ve died with them. I should’ve let him kill me.”</p><p align="left">“No, honey, you survived. You're the little hero.”</p><p align="left">“I’m not a hero! I’m selfish!”</p><p align="left">“No. You're not. You're not selfish, you did what you were supposed to do.”</p><p align="left">Rio buried her face deeper and squeezed her eyes shut, fisting the lawyer's shirt tightly.</p><p align="left">“Yes, I am. I’m selfish. I’m alive and they're not. They're not, Miss Viv. They're not with me.” She felt her little heart pounding in her chest. So loud, it was ringing in her ears. And it was too much to bear.</p><p align="left">“My heart… my heart… it hurts… so much....” She said between gasps. “Por favor, Miss Viv, por favor que se acabe. <em>Por favor.</em>” Little Rio lost it all. She begged for it to stop as her heart clenched tighter in her chest. Suffocating her. “I miss them.” A whisper followed by a gasp. “You ask me what I need. You say the law would do me justice, but… why justice taste so bitter? Why it can't bring them back to me?”</p><p align="left">The lawyer tightened her hold and said something, but Rio felt her senses go mute. Unable to catch the outside. She wasn't aware of anything around her. She just felt her eyes burning, her nose sniffing, her heart pounding, her vision dark from how she was burying her face, and her head was a chaos—filled with pictures and thoughts and memories.</p><p align="left">“<em>My heart will... explode.</em>” She gasped, unable to breathe. Rio felt herself being suffocated. Crushed down.</p><p align="left">“Please make it stop.”</p><p align="left">And she wept.</p><p align="left">Rio loosened her hold after what she assumed were long minutes, feeling her legs unable to hold her weight.</p><p align="left">She pulled back and wiped her eyes and nose with her sleeve, then looked up at the lawyer. She looked at her eyes long enough to start assuming that the lawyer was upset with her for doing such a thing. For weeping like a little baby.</p><p align="left">Because Rio felt herself being a lot.</p><p align="left">“I'm…” she swallowed her sob. “I'm sorry, Miss Viv.”</p><p align="left">And Rio walked away to her room, despite the lawyer calling her name from behind and her aunt from the side. </p><p align="left">Rio made her way up the stairs as tears continued to fall down.</p><p align="left">She didn't want to be their little hero; she wanted to be her parents’ little girl.</p><p align="left">She didn't want justice; she wanted her mother’s embrace to soothe her, to calm her heart and lull her to sleep.</p><p align="left">Thirteen-year-old Rio wanted to feel alive.</p><p align="left">She wanted to breathe and not feel suffocated.</p><p align="left">And for almost three decades, Rio yearned to be home.</p><hr/><p align="left">Soft kisses landed on her hair. Her forehead, her eyelids, the tip of her nose, her cheeks. Rio smiled as the kisses continued, her upper lip, her bottom one. She opened her eyes and Agatha started to kiss her chin, her jaw, her throat, her neck, her cleavage. Then she lifted her head up and their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">Brown met blue and stirred with it. Dancing the morning dance.</p><p align="left">Their smiles reflected the effects on each other’s faces.</p><p align="left">Rio inhaled deeply as she tried opening her eyes fully.</p><p align="left">“Good morning,” </p><p align="left">“I missed you,” Agatha whispered while brushing a strand of hair away from Rio's face.</p><p align="left">“Sorry, I might’ve…”</p><p align="left">Agatha lifted her finger to Rio's lips to silence her nonsense and apologies.</p><p align="left">“Shush.”</p><p align="left">Their eyes stayed locked. Though Rio was able to speak, she didn't want to.</p><p align="left">Because what was there to say?</p><p align="left">Looking at Agatha was enough.</p><p align="left">So she just smiled and looked at her. <em>Really</em> looked at her.</p><p align="left">Agatha felt like home, and she brought that feeling with her everywhere. Sheltering Rio with it.</p><p align="left">Because home wasn't a place or a land. </p><p align="left">Home was a person.</p><p align="left">Rio felt at home when she looked at the universe inside Agatha’s eyes. She found a home in her addictive scent and her intoxicating accent. In the way she snorted and lightened up when she laughed. It was in her features, one by one. In her skin and scattered freckles. In her birthmark and birthing mark.</p><p align="left">Home was in the way Agatha’s heart beat in Rio’s hold. It was in the way she acted and talked. Home was in the way Agatha looked at Rio while holding the entire world in her hand to give it to her. It was in the way she took Rio in and embraced her, wrapping her with her warmth. It was in the way she promised.</p><p align="left">Home was in the way Agatha said Rio's name with a rhythm every time. In the way she drew every detail of her with precision. In the way she kissed and worshipped her. Home was in Agatha’s touches. It was in the way she made Rio melt under her effortlessly. It was in the way she saw Rio and understood her. Home was in Agatha’s hip bones when she swayed them—although that was Rio’s altar, her place of worship. Of kneeling and praying.</p><p align="left">And after almost three decades of yearning for a home. Of trying to search for a little corner in the wrong places and faces. After she failed and got tired of searching—Agatha came and she was there, standing in front of Rio.</p><p align="left">And Rio realized that home was Agatha. </p><p align="left">Home was the woman that she looked at while drunk, and with just a look, she sobered her up and made her fall to her knees.</p><p align="left">Agatha lifted her finger up and leaned in to press a soft kiss to Rio’s lips. Her hair was falling to the sides, tickling Rio’s bare skin.</p><p align="left">“I'm gonna fix us a breakfast.” Agatha leaned in again, and her knee hit Rio’s heat from above the duvet in the process. Rio thought it was a little sinful accident, but when Agatha started moving her leg slowly, Rio moaned helplessly.</p><p align="left">It was on purpose. <em>Oh,</em> sweet torture.</p><p align="left">“And... I need you to put some clothes on, baby, before I go completely insane and forget that I have work to do.” Another kiss. “Preferably speaking, pick something from my closet. Wear my black tank top and the black shorts with the heart on the back. You know, the ones that make your ass look devourable, yeah? But... it's <em>totally</em> up to you.” Agatha smirked as she moved her leg again.</p><p align="left">Rio moaned involuntarily, then she huffed with a smile. “Is it edging day already?”</p><p align="left">Agatha's smirk widened. “Edging day?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, when you keep edging me all day until I lose my—<em>oh fuck, baby</em>,”</p><p align="left">Rio clung to Agatha’s shoulders as the woman on top of her started moving with intention.</p><p align="left">“I'm not edging you, baby. I would’ve fucked the ability of speaking out of you if I didn't know that I ruined you a few hours ago and you could barely walk now.”</p><p align="left">“Uh, mi corazón…” Rio was about to say something, but she fell silent, feeling the pain of her swollen, throbbing clit mixing with the pleasure sitting on the tips of her body, waiting to be pushed and flood her whole.</p><p align="left">“Mon cœur.”</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and pressed another kiss.</p><p align="left">“Is there… <em>fuck</em>… is there something else other than the dress code, ma'am? A favorite position maybe? Do you want me to crawl down the stairs?” Rio said mockingly, but her tone didn't help her achieve that goal. She sounded <em>desperate</em>.</p><p align="left">She closed her eyes shut and clung onto Agatha for dear life. Digging her nails in her shoulders, feeling them reach Agatha’s flesh even above the fabric.</p><p align="left">“Fuck, you'd look <em>so</em> good while doing that. Crawling back to me.”</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to Rio's temple. “I'll keep that in my mind for another day.” And she made no move to stop torturing Rio. “But now...” a kiss landed on the tip of Rio's nose. “I want you to do me a favor,” Agatha's leg didn't stop. She wasn't planning on doing so.</p><p align="left">“<em>Agatha</em>,” a helpless moan.</p><p align="left">“I want you to behave for just a few hours.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Baby</em>...”</p><p align="left">Their breaths grew heavier. </p><p align="left">“Can you do that for me, honey?”</p><p align="left">Rio opened her eyes. They were half-lidded and dark. Locking with Agatha’s.</p><p align="left">Rio nodded as she held Agatha’s shoulders tightly.</p><p align="left">“I will behave,” she bit her bottom lip to suppress her moans. “I will.”</p><p align="left">“Do you want to cum?”</p><p align="left">“Yes, oh god. Yes. I do.” Rio desperately breathed out. “<em>Please</em>,”</p><p align="left">And that did the trick. The sweet plea.</p><p align="left">Agatha moved her leg slowly but on purpose, hitting Rio’s swollen clit with every go.</p><p align="left">“Can you look at me while you cum? Can you do that?”</p><p align="left">Their dark eyes locked again.</p><p align="left">“Any, god... anything for you,”</p><p align="left">They just looked into each other’s eyes, without a word. Rio’s heavy, hot breaths filled the space between them.</p><p align="left">“I'm falling for you, Rio.” Agatha said, her voice was soft and honest.</p><p align="left">And Rio only blinked, several times. Batting her eyelashes and breathing heavily while feeling herself getting <em>closer</em>.</p><p align="left">“And for the first time in my life... I don't feel myself being pulled down. I'm falling on my own.”</p><p align="left">Agatha pressed her thigh and Rio came with a soft whimper. The intensity of her orgasm reached her, it was searing. She felt waves of pleasure running in her entire body, wave after wave. But that wasn't why her heart was pounding rapidly in her chest. And it wasn't why she couldn't even moan.</p><p align="left">Rio just came, her body was shaking under Agatha. She was looking into Agatha’s eyes who was staring down at her. Searching for uncertainty there.</p><p align="left">But her blue eyes were only filled with sincerity.</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed.</p><p align="left">“You're all I need.” Was the only thing she managed to say as she came down from her high. </p><p align="left">Agatha smiled and licked her lips. Leaning closer after stopping her leg’s movement and their mouths connected in a kiss. It was tender and honest. Their tongues intertwined slowly, patiently. </p><p align="left"><em>Lovingly.</em></p><p align="left">The kiss felt like something Rio yearned for.</p><p align="left">It felt like home. Her home.</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled back after kissing Rio’s neck, then she got up. Putting her clothes on.</p><p align="left">“Don't fall asleep.” She said with a wink and left while swaying her hips seductively. Making Rio grin like an idiot, drool over her, and forget to breathe.</p><p align="left">Rio stayed in Agatha’s bed for a few more minutes, though she wanted to sleep more, but having breakfast with Agatha was way more tempting.</p><p align="left">To look into her eyes and fall into them.</p><p align="left">So she got up, did her morning routine and wore what Agatha wanted her to wear.</p><p align="left">And she walked down the stairs, in the place that she felt herself more comfortable in than her own house. </p><p align="left">Agatha greeted her with a smile and Rio already felt her hands twitching, trying not to touch her.</p><p align="left">She looked so good. Seductive and pulling. Agatha looked <em>ethereal</em>. </p><p align="left">Even at this time of the morning, Agatha effortlessly looked like a goddess, and Rio simply wanted to kneel and worship her all day.</p><p align="left">So she just stood, leaning against the counter while Agatha moved around, preparing breakfast.</p><p align="left">“Why are you standing there like you're grounded?”</p><p align="left">Rio narrowed her eyes at her. “I <em>am</em> grounded... in a way.”</p><p align="left">“No, you're not,” Agatha chuckled as she put the food on the plates and poured honey on top of it.</p><p align="left">She looked to the side where Rio was standing and licked her fingers, one after the other.</p><p align="left">“Forgive me,” Agatha smiled. “But I need your hands on my hips so I can focus,” She looked into Rio’s eyes, then her eyes drifted to her mouth as she started speaking.</p><p align="left">“Is this a trap? I can't risk being impulsive right now.”</p><p align="left">“You should figure that yourself.”</p><p align="left">“This is not fair.” Rio pointed a finger at Agatha with a grin.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her then down at the finger. Twice. </p><p align="left">So she put the plates down, stepped forward, and bit the top of Rio’s finger. Then she sucked on it, slowly, rolling her warm tongue deliberately around it while looking straight into Rio’s eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio’s breath hitched and her stomach burned with the heat of her arousal.</p><p align="left">Her brain wasn't functioning in the right way. Her heart was pounding in her chest. Rio put her hand in the back of Agatha’s head and spread her fingers in her hair. Lifted Agatha’s head deliberately, put her other hand around her waist and switched their positions. Making Agatha’s back hit the counter.</p><p align="left">“I can behave, Agatha. But can you?” Rio asked as she placed her hands on Agatha’s hips and pinned her.</p><p align="left">Agatha smirked knowingly and leaned in to graze Rio’s ear, but Rio didn't give her the chance to do so and she pulled her head back slightly.</p><p align="left">“No chance, baby. If you want me to behave, you should too. So I'm setting a new rule for today. Don't touch me.”</p><p align="left">“That sounds really hot and <em>very, very</em> tempting. But that's not how things work around here.” Agatha's wicked smirk widened. She lifted her thigh up and pushed it between Rio’s slightly parted legs.</p><p align="left">Rio tried her best to not look affected. But who was she kidding?</p><p align="left">Agatha tensed her thigh muscle and Rio’s body twitched then Agatha leaned in and bit her ear instead of grazing it gently. </p><p align="left">She let out a warm breath on Rio’s skin.</p><p align="left">“Now, <em>big boy, </em>you need to eat your breakfast.”</p><p align="left">Rio’s eyes were blown wide. Dark and lustful.</p><p align="left">Despite the way she was squeezing Agatha's hips, Agatha loosened and removed them hand by hand then freed herself from the hold.</p><p align="left">She leaned in again and kissed Rio’s neck teasingly. Landed a light slap on her ass and walked away, setting breakfast on the table.</p><p align="left">Rio just turned around and looked at Agatha as she swayed her hips. Fighting her demons not to touch her.</p><p align="left">And they sat around the table, eating breakfast, drinking their coffee and sharing glances.</p><p align="left">Rio wasn't the shy kind, she was certain of it. But every time they sat around a table and shared a meal, her face and entire body set on fire. She'd turn red and blush by just a glance. Though that would happen in other contexts, but mostly, it was during eating. She felt the glances land on her heart rather than her eyes. </p><p align="left">Because, to be looked at and be seen. It was thrilling. It was <em>hell</em>.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Yes, I know how to build a boat from scratch,”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? And how did you learn that, sailor?”</p><p align="left">“Well,” Rio chewed while gesturing with her hand like that would speed it up. “My father used to build boats. High quality ones. It's how he used to spend his time when he was home.” A sip of coffee. “And I used to watch him do it. Help him. When he—they died, I tried to keep up the work. He had some unfinished ones. Well, at first I didn't know what the hell I was doing, but by twenty I rocked that shit. They're still at my aunt’s house.”</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled at her as she took a bite of her food, “Do you visit your aunt often?”</p><p align="left">Rio shook her head while sipping her coffee. “Nope. Not really. I like the woman and all, she was nice to me and I lived with her for quite a long time. But we don't get along. Never did. She always tried to be the therapist more than anything else. She used to introduce me to her friends to ‘<em>take a look at me</em>’ or whatever, like some rat lap or something. So... moving away from her felt like... breathing again, in some way.” Their eyes locked. Then Rio looked down at her plate. “She ruined the healing experience for me.” A choked chuckle. “For years... I was determined to be worse. You know, until I could achieve the worst version of me… fucked-up, right? I know.”</p><p align="left">“No, Rio. Look…”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, so when I did therapy again, years later, after I <em>really</em> turned into the worst version of me—I realized that shit wasn't going to do me any good. So I quit it like it was some part-time job or something.” </p><p align="left">Their eyes locked again. </p><p align="left">“There I go, ruining the meal.” Rio chuckled, as she sipped her coffee that turned cold.</p><p align="left">“You didn't ruin anything.” Agatha reached for her hand across the table. “You don't ruin, Rio. <em>Stop</em> saying that you do.” Agatha’s thumb gently brushed her skin. “There's nothing wrong with you. Everything that happened to you—every single thing—it didn't happen because you were some sort of... a bad person that didn't deserve a thing and had to be <em>punished</em> for the ruins they caused. No, baby. You're good. You're <em>so</em> good. Way better than you think.”</p><p align="left">Their fingers intertwined.</p><p align="left">“You know, when someone goes through a lot, and by a lot, I mean <em>a lot</em>—they start to think that they're doing something wrong. That they're some glitch in the system. But no. Maybe the world is cruel and everyone around was fucked up? And that one person had to deal with all of it. And because of how fucking good they are, they blame themselves and no one else. You're not bad, baby. There's nothing wrong with you. Even if you ruin, you fix more than what you ruin. You fix things you didn't even break. You're a goddamn healer, Rio.”</p><p align="left">Tears fell down her face. Fast and warm. She didn't even feel them until they started tickling her skin.</p><p align="left">“Why are you so… <em>delicate</em> with me?” Rio asked. Her voice wasn't as affected as her eyes, or as her heart.</p><p align="left">Agatha got up from her chair. Walked around the table and reached Rio. She cupped her face with both of her hands and started brushing the tears away with her thumbs.</p><p align="left">“Why not, angel?” </p><p align="left">“Don't make me cry. I could be such a crybaby, especially in the mornings.”</p><p align="left">“Are you now?” Agatha smirked, leaning in to kiss Rio’s wet cheek. “I don't want you to cry, I want you to know that. I mean it, Rio.”</p><p align="left">Rio nodded. “Thank you.”</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in for another kiss.</p><p align="left">They continued their breakfast. One conversation leading to another, and another. Then another.</p><p align="left">“My father was a priest.”</p><p align="left">Agatha said, after the conversation, in a way, led to it.  </p><p align="left">Rio’s eyes widened.</p><p align="left">“He wasn't my real father, though. But the only one I knew. And he was a piece of shit.” </p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her empty plate and mug of coffee.</p><p align="left">“And well... he fucked my childhood. Then he ran away. And I couldn't blame him. No one could handle my mother... <em>Ever</em>.” Agatha got up while holding her plates. “But it made me relate to Ingmar Bergman movies.” She joked. “I'm gonna go do some work now, yeah?”</p><p align="left">Rio only looked at her and nodded. She wanted to push, to talk about the way Agatha’s face changed the moment she started talking about her parents. But she didn't. Agatha would speak when she was comfortable with it. And Rio will wait.</p><p align="left">They kissed.</p><p align="left">Agatha went up to her studio. Rio washed the dishes and sat down doing some work afterward.</p><p align="left">By the time Agatha was back, Rio was lying on the couch, covering her eyes with her arm.</p><p align="left">So Agatha approached her. She just stood there, looking at Rio with a soft smile on her face.</p><p align="left">Rio wasn't asleep. She was just lying there and she felt Agatha’s stares—the way she was looking at her, the way she smiled and took a few steps forward. Rio felt it all. For some reason, she did. And her heart was pounding in her chest. Though she wasn't looking—she knew it and felt it.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and tried to wake Rio. She called her name gently. The way she dragged the two syllables in her mouth and rolled them with her tongue never failed to amuse Rio. Because her name sounded right only out of this woman’s throat.</p><p align="left">Rio removed her arm and looked at Agatha with a smile.</p><p align="left">“Thought you were sleeping.” Agatha started brushing Rio’s hair, looking down at her with <em>so much</em> yearning.</p><p align="left">“I tried to, but couldn't.”</p><p align="left">“Sorry, I took longer than I thought.”</p><p align="left">“No, it's okay, I also did some work I should've done weeks ago.”</p><p align="left">“How is it going? At work.”</p><p align="left">Rio sat down and stretched her arms overhead, showing off her navel—where Agatha’s eyes traveled before landing back on her eyes.</p><p align="left">“It's good. Going well. Some kids are driving me insane, but in general they're good kids.”</p><p align="left">“Good…” </p><p align="left">Rio stood up and faced Agatha.</p><p align="left">And Agatha looked at her, her expression was unreadable.</p><p align="left">“Um,” Agatha hesitated as she walked, heading to the kitchen and Rio followed close behind.</p><p align="left">“I wanted to talk with you about something.”</p><p align="left">“What is it?”</p><p align="left">“You know, Lilia’s birthday dinner party tonight…”</p><p align="left">“Yeah,”</p><p align="left">“Anyway, she's coming here so we could discuss the project we're working on. I think her girlfriend is preparing the party for her and she kicked her out of the house.” Agatha said, pouring herself the third mug of coffee.</p><p align="left">“Mhm,”</p><p align="left">“We're only going to be in the studio for two hours, max. So, if you're not ready to… be seen with me, it's totally okay. If you like, don't want her to know you're here or anything. I understand. You can do what's best for you.”</p><p align="left">Rio bit her bottom lip as sgew leaned on the counter and pretended to think about it.</p><p align="left">“I'm fine with it. Totally. I want to be seen with you, Agatha. I already told Alice and we're going together, so it's okay.”</p><p align="left">“You told Alice?”</p><p align="left">“Kinda, in a way,”</p><p align="left">“Yeah?”</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled and Rio reflected it on her face.</p><p align="left">“Yeah. And that woman is <em>dying</em> to meet you.”</p><p align="left">Agatha’s smile widened. She set her mug on the counter and pinned Rio’s hips and leaned in—their hips were flush against each other.</p><p align="left">“You know what I'm thinking?” Agatha said, as she leaned her face in and started kissing Rio’s neck.</p><p align="left">Rio shook her head slightly as she held back a whimper. “<em>No</em>, ” She swallowed. “I don't know,”</p><p align="left">Agatha looked up at her as sge pushed her hips forward and made Rio’s spine hit from the back.</p><p align="left">“I want to see you on all fours up here, but Lilia would be here in a few minutes,” She said with her low, lustful, deep voice. “So, what do you suggest we do?” Agatha leaned in, nipping Rio’s earlobe, making her moan helplessly in her hold.</p><p align="left">“We could…” She swallowed as she felt Agatha’s cold hand getting to her heat through the hem of the shorts she was wearing. “<em>We could</em>…” She struggled as Agatha’s fingers reached her cunt and started teasing her entrance with the tip of her finger.</p><p align="left">“Dripping? Already?” Agatha teased with a smirk.</p><p align="left"> “<em>Fuck…</em>”</p><p align="left">“Come on, baby. You'll get there.” Agatha's smirk widened as she pushed two of her fingers slowly into Rio’s—still recovering—sore cunt.</p><p align="left">“I don't know… just fuck me.”</p><p align="left">Agatha clicked her tongue. “Wrong answer.”</p><p align="left">And the doorbell rang.</p><p align="left">“Jesus, that woman travels fast.” Agatha withdrew her fingers, and before Rio could whine, she pushed them inside Rio's mouth. Making her suck on them.</p><p align="left">Rio moaned around her taste and like many times before, Agatha took her fingers out mid-sucking and sucked the rest herself. </p><p align="left">Agatha slapped Rio’s ass. “You ruined those. Go change them and get down.”</p><p align="left">Rio blinked several times, then she grinned like an idiot, heading upstairs to change her clothes. </p><p align="left">She made her way down the stairs, hearing Agatha and Lilia talking.</p><p align="left">For some reason, Rio was nervous as she walked. She was even sweating. But she managed to put a smile on her face.</p><p align="left">“Hey, Lilia!” Rio greeted with a grin as she walked forward. She hadn't seen the woman since her birthday <em>surprise-not-surprise</em> party. </p><p align="left">She noticed the way Lilia looked at her, then at Agatha, then back at her with wide eyes and a raised brow.</p><p align="left">Of course Agatha didn't tell her.</p><p align="left">“Rio? What are you doing here?” Lilia stood up and looked at Agatha who didn't take her eyes off Rio once she stepped into the living room.</p><p align="left">“We're…” Rio cleared her throat, looking at Agatha for encouragement. Agatha slightly nodded, and Rio smiled as she looked back at Lilia. “We're seeing each other. Me and Agatha.”</p><p align="left">“When did that happen?” The stunned woman was still ping-ponging glances.</p><p align="left">Agatha stood and placed her hand on Lilia’s shoulder.</p><p align="left">“Why are you panicking right now? Oh my god, Don't make it look weird!” Rio threw her hands around Lilia and embraced her with a smile.</p><p align="left">Lilia immediately embraced her back. Wrapping her hands around Rio’s body and taking her closer.</p><p align="left">“Kid, why didn't you tell me?” She said with that mothery voice of hers that made Rio shatter every time.</p><p align="left">Ever since Rio met Lilia years ago, she felt that sweet sense of peace around her. The woman tried her best to take care of Rio. To always check on her, even if Rio was acting like a dick and refused to meet or talk to anyone. Lilia was always an exception. She always knocked again even if Rio closed the door in her face. Even when Rio was depressed, Lilia was the wise voice that kept whispering in her ear. She was a weak spot that made Rio sob and shatter with just a change of a voice tone. </p><p align="left">And though most of the time Rio didn't listen, Lilia's words always stuck in her head. And she repeated them when needed.</p><p align="left">Though they both get busy, drifted by their lives, it always felt the same to be around the woman. She always comforted Rio without even knowing it.</p><p align="left">She saved Rio’s life once. And Lilia didn't know it— with a bottle of champagne, some cheesy jokes, and domino stones.</p><p align="left">She saved her from herself.</p><p align="left">And that woman also introduced her to Agatha. So Rio was forever grateful for her.</p><p align="left">Rio pulled back from the warm embrace and a single tear was hanging on the edge of her eye.</p><p align="left">“I was going to, but…” She scratched the back of her neck. Because honestly? There was no but. She just didn't know what to do or say.</p><p align="left">Lilia turned to the side and looked at Agatha.</p><p align="left">“And you!” She pointed a finger.</p><p align="left">Both women chuckled, except Lilia who was clearly pissed.</p><p align="left">“I asked you a week ago why the hell you have a portrait of Rio in your studio and you dismissed me like I was insane. I saw the way you blushed, by the way. I'm just a nice lady, that's why I didn't ask anything more!”</p><p align="left">And Agatha blushed again. Just like a week ago.</p><p align="left">“You are a nice lady, Lilia. What a decent woman,” Agatha said with a smile as she sat down on the couch.</p><p align="left">“<em>I'm her muse,</em>” Rio whispered to Lilia as she walked to sit beside Agatha.</p><p align="left">“Of course you're her muse.”</p><p align="left">“Woman! I whispered the words to you, why the hell are you yelling them!” Rio said and her face immediately turned red—unable to look at Agatha.</p><p align="left">But Agatha grabbed her waist tighter and pulled her closer.</p><p align="left">“Yeah, because this woman,” Lilia looked at Agatha, “Is obsessed with you and I only realized that <em>now</em>.” She sat down next to Rio.</p><p align="left">“Okay, nice lady. Drop it.” Agatha said, feeling herself getting exposed—like she wasn't exposed in the first place.</p><p align="left">They chatted for a while, then Agatha and Lilia went to the studio to discuss their work.</p><p align="left">Rio sat and tried to keep herself busy.</p><p align="left">Though Agatha told her to come with them because they wouldn't be doing anything that important, Rio insisted that she'd only disturb them. Agatha obviously didn't like the way Rio said that, so she just gave her a look and went up with Lilia.</p><p align="left">Half an hour in, Agatha came down and found Rio with her elbows on the kitchen island, scrolling through her phone and eating ice cubes.</p><p align="left">“Ice cubes? Really, baby?”</p><p align="left">“What? I'll fill them back, don't worry.” Rio stood straight with a smile and Agatha smiled back at her.</p><p align="left">Agatha turned her body and pinned Rio. Kissing her neck feverishly. </p><p align="left">“Missed me already?”</p><p align="left">“Mhm.”</p><p align="left">Agatha kissed her one last time, then she pulled back, grabbed two bottles of water and went upstairs again.</p><p align="left">By the time they finished—an hour and a half later—Rio was still scrolling through her phone even though nothing interesting was there—and <em>everything</em> interesting was busy working, and ignoring her—in a way. Because yeah, she was the one who refused to go to the studio with them, but she also knew if Agatha was working, that meant she was <em>really</em> working. Focusing every bit of herself on what she was doing. </p><p align="left">Rio heard them walking in the hallway, talking about something Rio was oblivious to.</p><p align="left">But she heard Lilia almost whispering,</p><p align="left">“Take care of Rio, Agatha. Don't hurt her in any way. She's a good kid. She gives a lot and she hurts herself for others.”</p><p align="left">And Rio’s tears fell down.</p><p align="left">She didn't have to say that. Now Rio was feeling vulnerable and exposed.</p><p align="left">“I know, Lilia. And I promise you, I won't hurt her.”</p><p align="left">“If you do, I won't go easy on you.”</p><p align="left">“Heard. Loud and clear.”</p><p align="left">And they stepped inside to where Rio was sitting.</p><p align="left">She brushed her tears immediately, stood up, and put on a smile.</p><p align="left">They both walked Lilia to the door. She told them to take care of each other, and they wished her a happy birthday, which she responded to with “Don't remind me of growing older.” Then she told them to not be late and be there on time.</p><p align="left">Once the door was closed, Rio let out a heavy sigh.</p><p align="left">Agatha turned around to face her.</p><p align="left">“Hmm? Someone’s bored?”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, and tired for no reason.”</p><p align="left">“Oh baby, come here.” Agatha said while offering her chest for Rio to lean on. And Rio accepted it without thinking. </p><p align="left">Embracing Agatha. Taking her scent in and feeling her body pressed against hers. Feeling her hand stroking her hair gently, <em>soothingly</em>. Listening to her heartbeat and sensing her chest rising and falling.</p><p align="left">It was heaven on earth. It was Rio’s heaven.</p><p align="left"><em>No.</em></p><p align="left">It was her home.</p><p align="left">Home was Agatha’s embrace.</p><p align="left">Home was Agatha.</p><p align="left">And since Agatha was here, it didn't matter if they actually did something or just sat and looked into each other’s eyes for hours. Because she was there—and even nothing with Agatha was a thing.</p><hr/><p align="left">After they embraced each other for a little while, they talked about everything and nothing all at once. Pressed kisses everywhere their mouths could reach. They pinned each other more than once, in different places in the house, though neither of them had an orgasm, because apparently, it was, in fact, edging day and Agatha wouldn't allow Rio to cum. The orgasm in the morning was a distraction to show Agatha’s hidden agenda—because she was denying Rio and herself all day.</p><p align="left">They made lunch together, just a light meal to satisfy their hunger for a while.</p><p align="left">Agatha was doing the actual work, and Rio was just holding her hips, kissing her, and taking her in to make her focus, upon Agatha’s request this morning. Because apparently, it wasn't a trap to take her down, but Agatha was really missing her hands on her hips. Missing Rio standing behind her and distracting her—but she claimed the distraction as focusing.</p><p align="left">And who was Rio to deny her something like that? She'd stick her hands on Agatha’s hips if she asked her to. </p><p align="left">They ate and talked and eye-fucked each other the entire meal. With Agatha’s successful attempts to tease Rio under the table. Brushing Rio’s leg with her bare foot. Moving it up to make her twitch and swallow her moans with her food.</p><p align="left">Because what could she actually do?</p><p align="left">Although Agatha was leaning on the physical teasing, Rio held her flirting like a sword and an armor in this battle, and she made Agatha blush, smirk or lower her gaze to her plate every time she had the chance.</p><p align="left">By the time they were done, they decided to lie in bed and watch a movie—which this time was Agatha’s time to pick. And Rio gave her a hard time again for not having a TV yet.</p><p align="left">“Well, the next movie afternoon is <em>definitely</em> at my place.”</p><p align="left">And Agatha agreed with a kiss that started as a delicate gesture and ended as a full make-out session that they had to end before they both came from just kissing and touching each other’s clothed bodies.</p><p align="left">By the time it was 5:30, they both got up and got going with preparing themselves for the party.</p><p align="left">Though Rio tried not to show it, her heart was pounding in her chest. Because the thought of being seen with Agatha was making her nervous. Not in a bad way, but in a thrilling way. In a way that made her heart bang in her chest alongside the heat she was feeling in her abdomen. But she didn't show it. Even though she applied her eyeliner with a shaking hand, she didn't show it.</p><p align="left">She finished before Agatha and decided to sit in the living room, sitting cross-legged in her strapless black dress just over the knee, checking with Alice, who was heading with her fiancée to Lilia's place.</p><p align="left">Rio adjusted her hair a dozen times, and Agatha was still not finished, so she decided to go check on her. The moment she touched the rail of the stairs, Agatha was coming down—Rio lifted her gaze to take in the woman who was wearing a breathtaking navy suit. </p><p align="left">The suit was great, beautiful, but it was Agatha who was breathtaking.</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed hard as her heart raced in her chest.</p><p align="left">God, this woman.</p><p align="left">“Sorry I made you wait, <em>my muse</em>.” Agatha said with a smile. Coming down the stairs, the clicking sound of her black stiletto shoes was loud and commanding. The shoes that Rio may or may not have been having sinful thoughts about. Like, getting corrupted and railed by this woman.</p><p align="left">She swallowed again, because she couldn't collect herself while Agatha was looking this good—and no one should expect her to. Rio was already losing control over herself, on the edge of kneeling.</p><p align="left"><em>Her muse. Oh, lord.</em></p><p align="left">“It doesn't matter, you're here.” Rio said with a low tone as she took Agatha’s hand and kissed the back of it. </p><p align="left">And yes, Rio was panicking. </p><p align="left">“You look gorgeous.” Agatha said once she was standing in front of Rio.</p><p align="left">She grabbed her hips and pulled Rio closer. Their senses got filled with each other's perfumes.</p><p align="left">“Maybe we should stay here and have our own dinner.” Agatha smirked as she leaned in and kissed Rio’s lips gently so as not to ruin their lipstick.</p><p align="left">“Unfortunately, we can't do that.” Rio said, playing with Agatha’s blazer. Their eyes were locked on one another.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s eyes drifted lower, to her cleavage.</p><p align="left">“You didn't hide those well, baby,” Agatha pointed out as she looked at a few, dark hickey marks that even the concealer failed to hide.</p><p align="left">“Fuck… let me grab my bag.” Rio tried to release herself from Agatha’s hold to grab her bag, but Agatha only tightened her grip on her waist.</p><p align="left">“Do you think it would be inappropriate to leave them like this?”</p><p align="left">“Well… yes.”</p><p align="left">“Then leave them.”</p><p align="left">“Agatha,” Rio smiled nervously.</p><p align="left">“Come on baby, we're gonna be late.” She leaned in and kissed Rio's neck teasingly.</p><p align="left">This woman…</p><p align="left">Rio put on her tailored blazer and they stepped out of the house, got in Agatha’s car and drove to Lilia’s place.</p><p align="left">They took off their seat belts, and Rio leaned in to open the door, but Agatha grabbed her wrist gently.</p><p align="left">Rio turned to look at her and their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">“I don't want to be this person but…” Agatha spoke softly, intertwining their fingers. “Don't drink too much tonight, yeah?”</p><p align="left">Rio smiled. </p><p align="left">“I won't.”</p><p align="left">And they got out of the car after a quick, tender kiss.</p><p align="left">Rio was sober for a week now, well technically. Because on the third day she had to drink a beer after a very shitty day at work. Two beers actually. Maybe three. Probably the six cans in the sixer she bought on the way home. Who was actually counting? Definitely not Rio.</p><p align="left">But other than that day, she was trying really hard. This was the second time in a decar that she was really trying to be sober. But the difference now, there was someone there, by her side.</p><p align="left">Agatha was by her side.</p><p align="left">They stepped into Lilia’s house.</p><p align="left">And there she was, on her feet, welcoming guests, with her girlfriend next to her.</p><p align="left">They both gave their gifts, the ones they bought together a few days ago.</p><p align="left">Rio took her blazer off, and Agatha gave her that look again with a smirk, which made Rio blush and she tried to dismiss it.</p><p align="left">Rio glanced at Alice beside Jen and they were talking to a certain redhead.</p><p align="left">Fucking Ron Weasley.</p><p align="left">And Agatha seemed to notice where Rio’s eyes landed, so she grabbed her waist tighter and pulled her closer, making Rio flush against her side.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and whispered in her ear, “Baby, don't worry,” then she pressed a soft kiss to her cheek—which made the hairs on Rio’s body stand to their ends.</p><p align="left">Because Agatha had just kissed her in a house filled with people.</p><p align="left">And that was why her heart started banging again. It was the affection. It was warm—<em>so</em> warm, almost burning—and Rio was <em>not</em> used to it in general, but especially not in public.</p><p align="left">And she was fighting herself not to go to that side table and down at least two drinks to chase the feeling away.</p><p align="left">Because what the hell was she supposed to do with her hands now? She needed a glass to hold, even if it was empty.</p><p align="left">But then Agatha leaned in again, “Are you okay, baby?”</p><p align="left">Rio looked at her for a few long seconds. “I'm fine.”</p><p align="left">Agatha slid her hand from her waist and intertwined their fingers together.</p><p align="left">Oh yes. That was what she was supposed to do with her hands.</p><p align="left">Hold Agatha.</p><p align="left">They walked to the inside of the house. Agatha was greeting some people that Rio didn't know and hadn't seen before—Lilia and Agatha’s mutual friends. Those artistic people.</p><p align="left">Rio was silent most of the time, standing beside Agatha, only speaking when spoken to. And she didn't mind it in the slightest. Because she couldn't handle an anxiety attack in the middle of her friend’s birthday party. <em>Again</em>.</p><p align="left">But the way Agatha was introducing her to her friends? That was going to give her a heart attack and not just an anxiety one.</p><p align="left">“This is Rio,” and Agatha would look at her side profile with the widest smile ever while Rio pretended she wasn't getting affected by the way she looked at her. </p><p align="left">Agatha was looking at her like she was something precious. Saying her name in a way that made her heart tighten in her chest.</p><p align="left">And Agatha’s hand stayed either on her waist or holding her hand.</p><p align="left">Maybe Agatha didn't know. Maybe she did—but Rio was so glad that she was there, grounding her.</p><p align="left">Because memories of what happened last year at Lilia’s birthday dinner party flooded her head. It was a disaster on a personal level. She had a fight with her ex-girlfriend, and that led to a big argument and a breakdown in the bathroom, and she couldn't stay there any longer so she got out early.</p><p align="left">But now, with Agatha beside her and her hand resting on her waist—Rio could do this party till it ended.</p><p align="left">“Hey dude, you're here.” Alice said as she leaned in to take Rio in a hug.</p><p align="left">“I am,”</p><p align="left">“Where’s Agatha?”</p><p align="left">“Catching up with her friend. Came here to find you. Where’s your fiancée?”</p><p align="left">“Grabbing us some drinks.”</p><p align="left">A few minutes passed with them catching up. Rio felt an arm wrapping around her waist, making her smile mid-sentence. </p><p align="left">“Hi Alice,” Agatha said, offering her hand for Alice to shake and she took it gladly.</p><p align="left">Rio noticed the way her friend grinned foolishly, she was such a fangirl.</p><p align="left">“Hi Agatha, Miss Harkness.”</p><p align="left">“Just call me Agatha.”</p><p align="left">“Agatha, right, I'm such a big fan of your work, I told you that before, didn't I?”</p><p align="left">Rio scoffed, “Jesus, Alice.”</p><p align="left">“What? I am. You know I am a fan, Rio.”</p><p align="left">“I know Alice. But you're panicking. Don't make it look weird, dude.”</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled. “Thank you Alice, It's a pleasure.” But her smile dropped briefly as her hold tightened on Rio’s waist when Jen and <em>a</em> <em>certain</em> redhead walked toward them. </p><p align="left">Rio looked at Alice, who was looking at her with the same look. And Rio’s heart pounded in her chest.</p><p align="left">Wanda’s eyes locked on Agatha, for a few, <em>really</em> long seconds that felt like a lifetime for Rio. </p><p align="left">“Agatha. Nice seeing you here.”</p><p align="left">“Likewise.”</p><p align="left">“Heard you're settling here?”</p><p align="left">“I am settled.” Agatha's hold tightened.</p><p align="left">Wanda’s eyes stayed longer on Agatha as if she was taking her in. From head to toe.</p><p align="left">Then her eyes drifted to Rio and her lips curled up in a smile.</p><p align="left">She offered her hand for Rio to shake.</p><p align="left">“Rio, right? I was at your birthday party.”</p><p align="left">“Yes, you were.” Rio feigned a smile.</p><p align="left">“So... you <em>really</em> know Agatha.”</p><p align="left">Rio’s hand tightened on Wanda’s, shaking it with a little too much force.</p><p align="left">Then their hands fell down.</p><p align="left">Wanda shook her hand in the air dramatically.</p><p align="left">“God, you're strong,”</p><p align="left">To break the tension that was hanging in the air and suffocating them, Jen decided to step in. So she introduced herself to Agatha. What a savior.</p><p align="left">At dinner, Rio sat in front of Agatha, Jen to her side facing Alice.</p><p align="left">But Wanda was sitting there, right next to Agatha. </p><p align="left">And Rio's blood was boiling.</p><p align="left">Every time Wanda leaned in, trying to talk with Agatha about something—like she had something to speak about with Agatha in the first place. And every time she'd whisper, it made Rio struggle in her place. Unable to hear a damn thing, but flames were jumping out of her eyes anyway.</p><p align="left">She saw Agatha dismissing Wanda every time, but that didn't change a thing. Didn't change the fact that her heart was rapidly pounding in her chest. Didn't change the fact that Wanda and all those dishes in front of her were making her sick.</p><p align="left">People talked as they ate and drank, talking about whatever the hell they were talking about—because Rio wasn't paying attention and wasn't hearing a damn thing. And she was fighting herself not to drink.</p><p align="left">It was too much.</p><p align="left">Alice mouthed to her, “What’s wrong?”</p><p align="left">And Rio responded, “Nothing,” A little too loud, causing several people to look at her.</p><p align="left">Now she could have a panic attack.</p><p align="left">She lifted her gaze to Agatha when she felt her teasing her with that fucking black stiletto.</p><p align="left">And maybe Rio was greedy. Maybe she was fucked up and a total mess. But she didn't care about that at the moment. She wanted Agatha's attention, all of it. In any kind, shape or form. Rio <em>needed</em> it.</p><p align="left">So Rio spread her legs a little wider under the table instead of closing them, and she let those shoes do the work. Her eyes were locked on Agatha and her hand was trying to do something with the fork in her hand.</p><p align="left">To her side, she heard a drunk, chuckling Lilia telling that goddamn horse-riding story that Rio had heard her telling at least a hundred times. </p><p align="left">And the heel started to go higher.</p><p align="left"><em>Higher.</em></p><p align="left">And Rio was fighting herself, looking at Agatha’s blue eyes, she felt herself getting pulled into their orbit.</p><p align="left">Wanda leaned in, she put her hand behind Agatha’s chair and whispered something right into her ear, causing Agatha to break the intensity of their eye contact and look at the redhead, who smiled at her, showing off her fucking, perfect, white teeth.</p><p align="left">And Rio?</p><p align="left">Rio closed her legs immediately as she felt a hot tear running down, or maybe several were falling down her face.</p><p align="left">She grabbed the glass of red wine to her side and gulped it. Her eyes turned red immediately and she never looked away from them.</p><p align="left">When Agatha looked back at her, Rio excused herself and got up. Causing almost everybody to look at her. </p><p align="left">Fucking birthday parties.</p><p align="left">Fucking socializing.</p><p align="left">She walked in a hurry, gulping half a glass of dirty martini she found on her way to the bathroom. </p><p align="left">Rio got in and locked the door behind her. Washed her face several times as she tried avoiding looking at herself in the mirror.</p><p align="left">She stood there, leaning her water-dripping face down to the sink, pitying herself.</p><p align="left">Because she was vulnerable, weak and jealous. <em>Again.</em></p><p align="left">And why?</p><p align="left">She knew Agatha was pushing that woman away.</p><p align="left">She knew Agatha didn't do anything.</p><p align="left">She knew she was only overreacting.</p><p align="left">But fucking hell, her heart was a few beats away from stopping.</p><p align="left">She might have a heart attack from how she was panicking and suffocating.</p><p align="left">Feeling herself getting crushed down, and this bathroom was only shrinking. </p><p align="left">The tears stopped falling. But when she finally looked up to her reflection, her eyes were red. As if everything she was feeling settled there.</p><p align="left">She was jealous, yes. And it was nauseating.</p><p align="left">She was helpless in front of herself. In front of it all.</p><p align="left">“Rio?” Agatha called from behind the door as she tried opening the bathroom door. “Baby? Are you okay?”</p><p align="left">Rio didn't say anything. She just looked at the water running in the sink.</p><p align="left">“Answer me, please.”</p><p align="left">“I'm—I'm fine.” She choked on her sob and she doubted Agatha had even heard her from how low and broken her voice was.</p><p align="left">“Open the door for me then. Let me in.”</p><p align="left">Rio was silent for a long minute, only hearing Agatha’s soft voice calling her through the door. And god, how it made her feel awful to do this to her.</p><p align="left">She splashed water on her face for one last time, then she walked to open the door.</p><p align="left">They looked into each other’s eyes for a second. Then Agatha got in, immediately closed the door behind her and leaned in—holding Rio in her arms. Taking her closer to her chest.</p><p align="left">“I'm sorry.”</p><p align="left">“I'm sorry.”</p><p align="left">They both said it at the same time.</p><p align="left">And Rio? Rio crashed down when Agatha started brushing her hair softly.</p><p align="left">She tried to soothe her, but Rio wasn't there. Not in that place. She didn't want to be soothed, she wanted to claim.</p><p align="left">She lifted her head up from Agatha’s chest and looked at her.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">The moment she looked into those blue eyes, she felt guilty. Guilty of making Agatha worry for just a tiny little bit. Guilty for being this weak and vulnerable.</p><p align="left">“I know it's so goddamn… it's childish… but fuck me. My heart, Agatha...” She rested her hand on her chest. “It hurts… so much. And I can't bear it. I can't fucking handle it pounding like this in my chest. I can't fucking handle seeing her, or anyone else getting close to you… it's a lot. I know I'm a lot.”</p><p align="left">Rio ran a furious hand through her hair, trying to turn around and not look at Agatha, but Agatha leaned in, wrapped her arm around Rio’s waist and grabbed her closer. Brushing her cheek with the back of her other hand as their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">But Rio’s heart didn't calm down and neither did her tears—because they resumed falling down her face. Hot and punishing.</p><p align="left">Agatha lowered her hand and rested it on Rio’s chest, right above her heart, as she felt it pounding in her hold.</p><p align="left">“It <em>is</em> loud,” Agatha said. </p><p align="left">“Agatha…” Rio exhaled a shaking breath.</p><p align="left">“I wouldn't be able to control myself if we were at some party and your ex was there. Sitting next to you at dinner. I would’ve exploded if someone leaned close to you like this, ex or not. So why are you saying it like you did something wrong by reacting, hmm?” Agatha grabbed Rio closer. “You're allowed to react. You can be jealous. You can be mad at me for acting in a certain way that you don't like and was hurting you. But no, you just hurt yourself. You just… god, you take it all on yourself.”</p><p align="left">Agatha’s hand was still resting on Rio’s chest, feeling her fast heartbeats and unsteady breaths.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked. Not even able to blink in the presence of each other.</p><p align="left">“I don't want to hurt you in any way. I don't want to hurt your heart, baby. I want to be good to you. And only you, yeah? Fuck Wanda and fuck everyone else. God, Rio...” Agatha closed her eyes and inhaled deeply, pressing her hand on Rio’s chest and tightening her hold on her waist.</p><p align="left">“You, Rio…”</p><p align="left">Rio closed the gap between them. She leaned in and crashed their mouths together, swallowing Agatha’s words down.</p><p align="left">Her lips and hands were shaking. Her hands traveled higher and cupped Agatha’s face, bringing her closer and closer.</p><p align="left">Desperate to take all of Agatha in. Kissing her as if Agatha were her salvation. And she was. Her salvation.</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't fight to take control, she was just standing there, doing her part. Allowing Rio to take what was hers.</p><p align="left">To claim her. To feel her.</p><p align="left">If Rio’s heart was diseased with jealousy, then she could find the antidote in Agatha’s mouth, and get rid of that fucking poison.</p><p align="left">She wanted to consume and be consumed by Agatha.</p><p align="left">“Agatha? Rio? Are you okay in there?” Lilia’s voice rang in her ears. But Rio didn't pull away. She couldn't. </p><p align="left">“Is everything okay?” </p><p align="left">Agatha pulled back slightly, breaking the kiss. She looked at Rio. Both of them were trying to breathe.</p><p align="left">“We're okay, Lilia.” Agatha said. She was heavily breathing with her eyes locked on Rio. Their faces were just a breath away. “Just a minute. We'll be there.”</p><p align="left">“Is Rio okay?”</p><p align="left">“I'm fine, Lilia.” Rio said as she held Agatha’s hand tightly in hers.</p><p align="left">“Okay. Don't be late, we'll eat the cake without you.” Lilia said with a chuckle. That woman was wasted.</p><p align="left">Before even knowing if Lilia was gone or not, Agatha leaned in and kissed Rio again. Their bodies were flush against each other.</p><p align="left">Rio’s hands slid under Agatha’s blazer and grabbed her waist, pulling her closer and closer to her body.</p><p align="left">Her hands slowly slid lower to Agatha’s ass, causing her to moan softly and for Rio to swallow the sound.</p><p align="left">She started moving her hands forward, touching Agatha's thighs above the fabric, causing several shivers to run down Agatha’s spine.</p><p align="left">Rio put her fingers in the belt loops for a few seconds, then she pulled her head back slightly. Looking into Agatha’s dark, blue eyes and pulling her closer by the belt loops, even though there wasn't any closer left.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked at Rio. Her chest was rising and falling heavily.</p><p align="left">She licked her lips, and before Rio said anything, Agatha spoke.</p><p align="left">“She tried to provoke me. It's how she plays.” Agatha leaned in and tucked a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. “None of what she says is important. Don't think about her. I just want you to think about me.”</p><p align="left">“You're all I want to think about, Agatha.”</p><p align="left">They kissed again. Feeling themselves getting lost in each other.</p><p align="left">They pulled back and tried to adjust their hair and smudged lipstick. Then they got out before someone came to search for them.</p><p align="left">After dinner, came the cake which Lilia made a dozen times better with her hilarious state and constant tripping. </p><p align="left">Rio and Agatha were standing side by side, laughing at one of Lilia’s absolutely not-funny stories. </p><p align="left">Rio looked to her side. To Agatha.</p><p align="left">How beautiful she looked with a smile on her face. She looked ethereal.</p><p align="left">And for Rio to have her by her side, grabbing her waist, feeling the warmth of her body, inhaling the intoxicating scent of her—it felt unreal. All of it.</p><p align="left">And the words, they were trapped in her mouth. Rested on the tip of her tongue. Unable to voice them out loud.</p><p align="left">Agatha turned to look at Rio, and her smile widened as her pupils dilated briefly the moment she looked at her.</p><p align="left">“What?” Agatha asked and her voice was clear, landing straight into Rio’s ear despite the noise, the talking, the music in the background. In a way, her ears knew what mattered. What Rio wanted to listen to.</p><p align="left">“You're beautiful,” Rio softly admitted as she took the glass of red wine from Agatha’s hold while looking straight into her eyes. Rio took two sips, then gave it back to her.</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't say a thing, she just smiled and looked at the birthday woman. </p><p align="left">She was blushing.</p><p align="left">By the time the evening ended, they got out.</p><p align="left">Alice and Jen asked to join them for a few rounds of drinks, but Agatha said she had to work tomorrow. </p><p align="left">“But we will go on a double date!” Alice yelled, clinging to her fiancée's side who was fighting for her life to hold her without making her fall.</p><p align="left">Rio and Agatha laughed and nodded for her to go.</p><p align="left">“Heading home?”</p><p align="left">They both turned around to see Wanda standing there.</p><p align="left">“Yes, Wanda,” Agatha said as she tightly held Rio’s hand.</p><p align="left">“We should meet sometime.”</p><p align="left">“Why is that exactly? To strengthen the bond?”</p><p align="left">“Yes, why not? I'd like to know more about Rio.”</p><p align="left">Agatha tossed her car keys into Rio’s fist, telling her to go to the car.</p><p align="left">But Rio didn't, she stood there, beside her.</p><p align="left">“So you could talk shit about me in front of her? Because it hurts to see me happy with someone else, right?”</p><p align="left">“You left.”</p><p align="left">“Do you think I'm stupid, Wanda? No, seriously, do you think I'm <em>that</em> stupid?” Agatha took a step toward her ex, making Wanda take one backward.</p><p align="left">“What are you saying? That you didn't leave?”</p><p align="left">Agatha scoffed.</p><p align="left">“Where’s Natasha?”</p><p align="left">Wanda’s face changed color.</p><p align="left">“She's at home. Wait… what does Nat have to do with all of this?”</p><p align="left">“Wanda, I know about you. I've known for years. So Stop acting like a victim. It's pathetic.”</p><p align="left">Agatha grabbed Rio’s hand and they walked away, technically dragging Rio with how fast she was walking.</p><p align="left">They got in and Agatha was furious, cursing her ex under her breath as she fastened her seatbelt.</p><p align="left">Rio started the engine.</p><p align="left">“Hey, baby,” she put her hand on Agatha’s thigh. “Look at me,”</p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her.</p><p align="left">“What's wrong?”</p><p align="left">Her blue eyes softened. “Nothing, I think I just had so much to drink. And she kept showing up all night... testing my patience.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, don't think about her.” Rio gently moved her hand up and down Agatha's thigh. “I'm here.”</p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her, her eyes were half-lidded and calm.</p><p align="left">“<em>Thank god you're here.</em>”</p><p align="left">She leaned in and kissed Rio's lips—a kiss that held so much weight but still translated with tenderness on their lips.</p><p align="left">When they pulled back, Rio tucked a strand of Agatha’s hair.</p><p align="left">“You said it yourself. Fuck Wanda and everybody else. I want to be good to you, the same way you're good to me, Agatha. And don't think about them… just think about me.”</p><p align="left">“You're all I think about, baby.”</p><p align="left">Rio drove them to Agatha’s place. And their night was far from over.</p><p align="left">When they stepped inside the house, they were each other’s to ruin and fix.</p><p align="left">Because they were each other’s.</p>

<p><em>Come to me, my love.</em><br/><em>I am here,</em><br/><em>Standing in the in-between.</em><br/><em>I don’t want to return to the beginning,</em><br/><em>where I didn’t know you.</em><br/><em>I don’t want to reach the end;</em><br/><em>Afraid we might end.</em><br/><em>Leave me here,</em><br/><em>standing in the middle.</em><br/><em>But you?</em><br/><em>You come.</em><br/><em>Come to me.</em><br/><em>I am here.</em><br/><em>Waiting to begin again.</em><br/><em>To live for the first time with you by my side.</em></p><p align="left">“Agatha?” Rio called as she put her keys in the bowl. The keys to Agatha’s house.</p><p align="left">The ones Agatha gave Rio when she spent the night at her place four days ago.</p><p align="left">And in the morning, when Rio had to go to work, wearing one of Agatha’s suits that was a little larger than her own—the light grey one that Agatha helped Rio put on, piece by piece. Kissing Rio’s skin, spot after spot.</p><p align="left">Agatha came down the stairs and called for her before Rio put her hand on the door handle. Calling her name softly. Tenderly.</p><p align="left"><em>Lovingly.</em></p><p align="left">A silky robe was put on her shoulders languidly, not even bothering to tie it. Her pale skin made Rio's mouth water the moment she turned around and looked at her.</p><p align="left">Rio's eyes kept drifting between Agatha's enchanting eyes and how <em>ethereal</em> she looked.</p><p align="left">Agatha held Rio’s hips the moment she approached her and pulled her closer, stopping Rio from taking another step back with a kiss. Holding her hips tightly with both of her hands as their tongues tangled in a heated kiss. Rio felt an object in Agatha’s hand; she was clenching it a little too tight in her fist so as it wouldn't dig into Rio’s hip.</p><p align="left">When they pulled back slightly, their eyes locked. Rio’s lips curled up in a warm smile. </p><p align="left">She felt herself like a goddamn balloon, almost floating in the place. And instead of hitting the ceiling, the only thing that kept her grounded was Agatha’s hold on her hips. Feeling as if her string was wrapped around Agatha’s wrist so she wouldn't stray away.</p><p align="left">“What was that for?” Rio asked with amusement, as her eyes kept drifting between the most captivating pair of blue eyes she had ever seen and drowned in—and the most perfect pair of lips she had ever kissed and felt the warmth of.</p><p align="left">Agatha stood in silence for a few long seconds, only looking at Rio’s face with a smirk on her face. She leaned in again and pressed a soft kiss to Rio’s lips. </p><p align="left">“You look so beautiful,” Agatha said, pulling Rio even closer to her. And Rio only grinned, feeling so much warmth. So much <em>love</em>.</p><p align="left">And before Rio could say anything, Agatha took her hand and put the keys in her hold.</p><p align="left">“Here,” she said, not looking away from Rio’s face.</p><p align="left">Rio looked down at her hand, and her smile dropped briefly.</p><p align="left">“So you wouldn't have to call me every time you come here.”</p><p align="left">Rio looked up at her.</p><p align="left">“Agatha… are you sure?”</p><p align="left">“About what?” Both of Agatha’s hands were back on her hips.</p><p align="left">“About this. Giving me this.”</p><p align="left">“Yes, baby. I'm sure.” </p><p align="left">Rio tossed the key inside her pocket and placed her other hand on the back of Agatha’s neck, pulling her in a kiss that lasted for minutes, filled with so many emotions—that for the first time—Rio was able to handle. To take all of them and feel them flooding her body with… <em>love</em>.</p><p align="left">And since that day, Rio had never looked at that key as if it was just a key. It was much more.</p><p align="left">So much more.</p><p align="left">She got upstairs after calling Agatha’s name again. She looked for her in the bedroom, but it was empty.</p><p align="left">So she stood in front of the studio’s wooden door. She raised her hand up to knock on it, and before doing so, Agatha spoke.</p><p align="left">“Come on in, baby. I'm here.”</p><p align="left">A warm, fond smile found its way onto Rio’s face. She pulled the door handle and got in.</p><p align="left">Agatha was in front of her, lying on the floor in shorts and a flannel shirt. Her eyes closed, her hand raised in the air with a cigarette resting between her fingers, the smoke raising up in the atmosphere.</p><p align="left">Rio grinned as she approached her.</p><p align="left">“What are you doing on the floor?”</p><p align="left">Agatha only smiled without opening her eyes. When Rio took the cigarette from her, she did.</p><p align="left">Rio inhaled as she looked down at Agatha.</p><p align="left">“Do you always look so handsome when you get back from work?”</p><p align="left">“Only once or twice a month.”</p><p align="left">“Don't spread false information, baby. Someone might believe you.”</p><p align="left">Rio narrowed her eyes as she inhaled again, then gave the cigarette back to Agatha.</p><p align="left">“Do you believe it?”</p><p align="left">Agatha moaned softly. “<em>Absolutely not.”</em></p><p align="left">“That what matters.” Rio leaned in, as close as possible, until she was able to press a kiss on Agatha’s lips.</p><p align="left">When she pulled back to stand again, Agatha held her hand tightly.</p><p align="left">“Come here.”</p><p align="left">“Here?”</p><p align="left">“Yes,” Agatha said, holding Rio’s hand and pulling her in.</p><p align="left">Without saying anything more, Rio took off her black blazer and remained in the white tank top as she straddled Agatha’s body. Shaking her head with a smirk resting on her lips.</p><p align="left">Agatha inhaled the last of the cigarette as she focused her eyes on Rio, then turned her face to the side and stubbed it on the floor.</p><p align="left">She put both of her hands on Rio’s hips as she exhaled in the atmosphere between them.</p><p align="left">Agatha started moving her hands up and down Rio’s sides.</p><p align="left">“Do you need anything?” Rio asked, her voice was low and deep.</p><p align="left">“No,” Agatha said as she pulled out the tank top that was tucked under Rio’s pants. Then she slid her warm hands underneath it and started stroking the skin of Rio's sides soothingly.</p><p align="left">Rio sighed softly as she felt Agatha’s hands drifting to rest on the waistband of her pants.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked, and she swallowed.</p><p align="left">“How was your day at work?”</p><p align="left">“Good… it was fine.”</p><p align="left">Agatha put her fingers in the belt loops and pulled Rio’s body closer, almost making her lay on top of her.</p><p align="left">Then she unbuttoned her pants.</p><p align="left">“I brought…” Rio swallowed hard, feeling Agatha’s fingers on her skin. “I brought food with me.”</p><p align="left">“Mhm. Later.”</p><p align="left">Their eyes stayed locked.</p><p align="left">Agatha put her fingers in the belt loops again and pulled Rio’s upper body even closer to her face.</p><p align="left">Rio felt like she had nowhere to go, and she had never felt this much pleasure while being trapped before.</p><p align="left">She put both of her palms on either side of Agatha’s head on the floor and leaned in.</p><p align="left">When she drifted her eyes away from Agatha’s, she glanced at the opened sketchbook by her head.</p><p align="left">Rio smirked.</p><p align="left">“Oh? Drawing me again?”</p><p align="left">Agatha matched her smirk, but it was even wider.</p><p align="left">“I can't help it, <em>my muse</em>,” she said as she placed one of her hands on Rio’s back, pushing her closer to her.</p><p align="left">“You can't help it. You're obsessed with me.” Rio grinned.</p><p align="left">“I am.”</p><p align="left">“You know…” Rio said, her face was a heavy breath away from Agatha’s. “You said you'd paint me.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? And you said you'd love to pose for me.”</p><p align="left">“I would love to.”</p><p align="left">Agatha bent both of her legs up, put both of her hands on Rio’s hips, and switched their positions smoothly. Slowing down a bit as she laid Rio’s head on the floor, then she was on top of her. Her hands on either side of Rio’s head, trapping it. And one of her legs rested between Rio’s.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked, and their wide smirks matched.</p><p align="left">“I want you to pose for me. <em>God</em>, I need you to do that.”</p><p align="left">Rio managed lifting her head up slightly to press a soft kiss on Agatha's lips, and Agatha was quick to take off the barrette that was pining Rio’s hair up, letting the dark locks that got longer since Rio decided to cut them loose on the white floor.</p><p align="left">Rio felt her heart pounding in her chest. Feeling Agatha’s weight on her. Taking in her scent every time she inhaled. Feeling her close to her body.</p><p align="left">And she just wanted that. All of it.</p><p align="left">She wanted to feel Agatha. All of her.</p><p align="left">“You're not breathing.” Agatha stated with a smirk. Many other times she'd said this exact same sentence with concern written all over her face. But now, it was dark. It was delicious to hear and see.</p><p align="left">“How can I? With you being this… close to me? <em>God</em>…”</p><p align="left">“Yeah? Breathe for me, baby,” Agatha said, the smirk was still visible on her features.</p><p align="left">Her eyes were dark and from how close her face was to Rio's—Rio was able to see her reflection in them. And it was the only reflection Rio was able to look at without turning her face away. Because it was in Agatha’s eyes. It felt like she could really see herself in the woman’s eyes, and it wasn't even metaphorical.</p><p align="left">Rio put her hands on Agatha’s back and pushed her toward her to lean in even more. And she whimpered straight into Agatha’s mouth as she felt Agatha’s leg resting exactly between hers. Utterly on her heat.</p><p align="left">“I want to breathe you, if you don't mind,” Rio said with a helpless smile, her eyes were half-lidded and dark with lust and anticipation.</p><p align="left">Leaning Agatha in even more, and lifting her head up, Rio was able to bury her face in Agatha’s warm neck.</p><p align="left">“I don't mind. Go ahead, fill your lungs with me if it's the only way to make you breathe properly.” Agatha moaned the words as Rio started inhaling Agatha in and exhaling her warm breaths on her skin. Feeling Agatha shake above her.</p><p align="left">“You're right, my love. You're the only one that could make me breathe properly.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Ah, Rio…</em>” Agatha moaned softly. </p><p align="left">Rio felt how Agatha’s arms were almost shaking by her sides. Pressing on the floor with her palms so hard. So Rio put one of her hands on Agatha’s back and the other on the back of her head—securing it tenderly with her hold—and instead of pulling Agatha in, she switched their positions and Agatha was lying on the floor again.</p><p align="left">Rio was on top of her, imitating the way Agatha was on top of her a few seconds ago.</p><p align="left">Then she leaned in, burying her face in Agatha’s neck once again. Taking her in with urgency. As if she really wasn't able to breathe. As if Agatha was the only thing keeping her alive.</p><p align="left">And that was the case since she started falling for the woman. Rio felt like she wasn't more than a body before her and Agatha was able to pour a soul into her.</p><p align="left">Slowly making her drink it, until she was full.</p><p align="left">But Rio was never full.</p><p align="left">Never full with Agatha. And as much as Agatha was willing to pour into her, Rio will take her until she flooded—and even that won't stop her from taking what Agatha would give her.</p><p align="left">“<em>Agatha.</em>” Rio kept repeating her name with every deep inhale and a warm, shaking exhale on Agatha’s skin.</p><p align="left">Her leg was moving up and down absentmindedly. But she was feeling it—under the layers, she was feeling the heat radiating from Agatha’s cunt, hitting her leg and body through the layers of fabric.</p><p align="left">And it was luscious. </p><p align="left">She felt Agatha’s body trembling underneath hers. She felt Agatha's breaths shaking as she clung onto her shoulders.</p><p align="left">And Rio was still breathing through her.</p><p align="left">“You smell so good. You're intoxicating… God, you're…”</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her body up an inch without pulling her head up from its place. She drifted her hand slowly, opening the buttons of Agatha’s shirt as her nose was digging in Agatha’s neck. </p><p align="left">She opened them all, feeling Agatha’s skin with her palm, taking a path between their bodies, until she slid her hand down underneath the waistband of Agatha's shorts—her fingers reaching their destination.</p><p align="left">And she paused for a second.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck, Rio. I need you,</em>” Agatha whined, her words and hot breaths landed straight on Rio’s ear.</p><p align="left">“Ah, god. You're not wearing underwear? <em>Oh, baby.</em>” Rio moaned breathlessly on her skin.</p><p align="left">When she finally felt Agatha’s heat on her palm, Rio lifted her head up, and Agatha immediately removed her hands from Rio’s shoulders to her hips. Holding her tightly, almost digging her short nails in her flesh.</p><p align="left">The moment they were face to face and their eyes locked, Rio felt her heart stop for a moment—only for it to pound so hard in her chest as she stared at those blue eyes and moved her palm up and down Agatha’s drenched slit.</p><p align="left">“I want that. To paint me while I pose for you. I need it.”</p><p align="left">Her hand started moving faster, feeling Agatha holding her hips tighter than ever.</p><p align="left">“I want you to see me right in front of you. I want to look into your eyes while you see me…”</p><p align="left">Rio pushed a single finger into Agatha's entrance and started thrusting it slowly, deeply.</p><p align="left">“I want you to look at my body and face and paint them like you've never done before. I want you to forget everyone that once posed for you. Everyone you looked at and painted with your talented hands…”</p><p align="left">She added another and started stretching deeper.</p><p align="left">Their eyes stayed locked, as if they were frozen. Unable to look at anything else but each other.</p><p align="left">“Because they weren’t me—and they were <em>so</em> lucky to have you look at them. But… this body? This body is yours. You own it. My heart? Yours. <em>I'm yours,</em><em> Agatha.”</em></p><p align="left">“Yes, you're mine,” Agatha said heavily, followed by a loud moan when Rio started rubbing lightly on her clit with her thumb.</p><p align="left">“I am. I'm yours. All of me. And I’m your muse, aren’t I?”</p><p align="left">“Yes, you are my everything, Rio.” Agatha closed her eyes. “<em>Baby…</em>” She moaned softly.</p><p align="left">“Open your eyes, please. I want to see you.”</p><p align="left">And Agatha did. She opened her eyes slowly—half-lidded, dark and enchanting. </p><p align="left">Rio started thrusting her fingers faster, hitting that sweet spot as she continued rubbing the throbbing clit.</p><p align="left">“I want you to cum for me.”</p><p align="left">And a few more thrusts, Agatha came with a loud, heavy moan, as she forced her eyes to remain open and locked with Rio’s so Rio could look into them. To see her effect on her.</p><p align="left">Rio slowed her pace and only took her hand out after Agatha’s body calmed down underneath hers and she was able to loosen her tight hold on Rio's hips.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her glistening fingers up. </p><p align="left">“Open your mouth for me.”</p><p align="left">And Agatha did the exact same second. She opened her mouth and Rio brushed her bottom lip slightly before putting her fingers inside the heat of Agatha's mouth to suck on and to wrap her warm tongue around.</p><p align="left">Agatha moaned on her own taste, and before finishing sucking Rio’s fingers clean, Rio pulled them and sucked the rest as she kept looking straight into Agatha’s blue eyes.</p><p align="left">Tasting and smelling her with hunger. Everything about Agatha was intoxicating.</p><p align="left">Then Rio drifted her hand lower, palming Agatha’s skin. When she felt Agatha trying to switch their positions again, Rio spoke.</p><p align="left">“No.” She denied softly, and she saw the shift in Agatha’s eyes.</p><p align="left">“I will take my clothes off now, and I… I will pose for you. And you will use your <em>so</em> fucking talented hands to paint me and then… then I need your fingers inside me.”</p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her for a second as she started moving her hands up and down Rio’s sides.</p><p align="left">“Baby, you just came back from work and you're probably hungry…” Her voice was soft, filled with concern and sincerity.</p><p align="left">“<em>Please.</em>” Rio pleaded while leaning her face in.</p><p align="left">Agatha smiled fondly as she stared at Rio’s eyes and her movements never stopped.</p><p align="left">“Anything you want.”</p><p align="left">Rio leaned in even more and pressed a soft kiss on Agatha’s parted lips.</p><p align="left">Then a flicker of uncertainty washed over her as she looked at Agatha’s eyes.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s movements stopped the same second as Rio used her arms to sit down and straddle Agatha’s body briefly, then she sat on her heels on the floor.</p><p align="left">“But if you're resting, tell me. If you don't want to. I don't want to be demanding.” </p><p align="left">Agatha followed suit and sat down. She took Rio’s hand in hers and Rio just looked at her flushed state. How her hair was messy. How her eyes were dark and half-lidded.</p><p align="left">They stared into each other’s eyes.</p><p align="left">“You're not demanding. But I want you to demand things from me. I want you to tell me everything you want from me, and I will provide it. No matter what it is.” Agatha put a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. </p><p align="left">“You think you're demanding because you want me to paint you? Rio, how can I tell you that I've been thinking about it the moment you said you'd pose for me? How many times have I pictured it in my head and repeated it over and over again?” Agatha put her hand on the back of Rio’s neck as she leaned closer to her.</p><p align="left">“How can I tell you that the only thing that occupies my head is you? I can't think of anything or anyone else but you. From the moment you leave my eyesight until I see you again—and even when you're here with me… <em>it's just you, Rio</em>. I've never felt this… <em>free</em>, while working—until you came into my life. The moment I saw you, the night I tried painting your beautiful face out of my memory, my life shifted entirely, and I don't want to go back. And you fear being demanding?” Agatha leaned in closer, resting her forehead on Rio’s. </p><p align="left">“Tell me how you're being demanding while you're offering yourself to me? Demand if you want to be. Tell me what I should do for you, and I will do it.”</p><p align="left">Rio closed her eyes as she pulled Agatha’s head closer to hers. Their foreheads were resting on one another. Their breaths were heavy and unsteady</p><p align="left">“I don't want to go back either. I don't want to go back where I didn't even know you. I want to start from here, with you by my side. I want…”</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed as she felt her heart still banging in her chest. “I want to be good to you and to truly deserve you, Agatha.”</p><p align="left">“You're good to me. So good, baby. And you deserve me, don't doubt that. I'm yours the same way that you're mine. I want you to trust me and believe me when I say that you own every piece of me, Rio. I'm all yours.”</p><p align="left">Their faces leaned closer and their mouths connected in a tender kiss. Their tongues tangled with heat and confessions resting on their tips.</p><p align="left">And they continued kissing messily. Sucking and nipping and breathing heavily as they held each other and stood on their feet. </p><p align="left">The kiss deepened, and neither of them was trying to pull away. They only seemed to pull each other closer, as close as possible. To feel the heat of their bodies and mouths. To hear each other's rapid heartbeats.</p><p align="left">Rio put her hands on Agatha’s hips under her unbuttoned shirt and started walking their bodies to get out of the studio. </p><p align="left">Their feet were stepping forward and backward in hurried but calculated steps, as if they were dancing—  dance they knew every step of.</p><p align="left">Holding each other in a way that made them look like they were colliding. </p><p align="left">Unable to pull back.</p><p align="left">Rio turned their bodies around so she could pin Agatha’s body on the wall beside the door. She pulled back and looked at Agatha’s eyes. Their chests were rising and falling heavily. </p><p align="left">Then she leaned in again and kissed Agatha’s neck, sucking on her skin.</p><p align="left">“You're all I need, Agatha.”</p><p align="left">Before letting Agatha say something, their mouths were back again to devour.</p><p align="left">Rio squeezed Agatha’s sides and walked their bodies to the side, feeling both of Agatha’s hands fisting her hair.</p><p align="left">They got out and kissed all the way to the bedroom, pulling back slightly only when air became a necessity.</p><p align="left">Rio guided Agatha to sit on the bed as she took off her pants and tank top, locking her eyes with Agatha’s as she freed herself from the layers of fabric.</p><p align="left">And <em>oh</em>, how goddamn perfect and ethereal Agatha looked. Sitting there. Devouring Rio with her eyes.</p><p align="left">“Should I lay down?” Rio asked, still breathless.</p><p align="left">“Whatever you want.”</p><p align="left">“You tell me what to do.” Rio walked toward Agatha and kneeled by her feet. “Guide me. Tell me how to please you. How to offer myself to you so you could take me entirely.” Her hands were moving up and down the exposed skin of Agatha’s legs. Her palms were hot, but Agatha’s body was scorching. </p><p align="left">Agatha cupped her face and her thumbs started stroking Rio's face gently.</p><p align="left">“Take those off and come lay down.”</p><p align="left">Rio obeyed. Her hands went behind her back and unclasped her bra, then she used Agatha’s knees as leverage to stand up and take her underwear off.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked up at her. Taking Rio's body in with dark eyes.</p><p align="left">She licked her lips.“<em>You're perfect.</em>”</p><p align="left">Then she stood up to face Rio. They kissed again, and through the kiss Agatha guided Rio’s body to lay down—adjusting the pillows with one hand and holding Rio’s waist with the other.</p><p align="left">Then Agatha pulled back and walked to be in front of the bed, looking at Rio’s bare, lying body. Looking at Rio, <em>seeing</em> her, exactly how she did once before.</p><p align="left">And Rio, once again, felt looked at.</p><p align="left"><em>Seen</em>.</p><p align="left">“Lift your leg up,” Agatha told with a deep, low voice. The lust and arousal were visible in her command. </p><p align="left">Rio obeyed, bending her leg up without giving a damn about how drenched she was. She was aware that she was dripping on the mattress. That she was turned on. It was no secret.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s breath hitched, and she immediately lifted her eyes up to lock them with Rio. She was fisting her hands by her side, her knuckles turning white, and she was digging her teeth in her bottom lip so hard.</p><p align="left">Agatha was struggling, and Rio knew it.</p><p align="left">She saw it.</p><p align="left">“Let me touch you. Let me take care of you.” Agatha took a step forward as she put her palms on the bed, a second away from crawling up and being on top of Rio’s body. </p><p align="left">Agatha just wanted Rio to say it.</p><p align="left">Rio shook her head slightly with a smirk as she put her arm behind her head, resting on it.</p><p align="left">“Afterward.”</p><p align="left">“Rio.”</p><p align="left">“I'm dying to let you touch me. I think I will cum from just... looking at you looking at me, but… afterward.”</p><p align="left">“It could take hours, Rio.”</p><p align="left">“I know.” Rio said with a grin. As if she were confident. As if she really could wait for hours.</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't say another word. She just looked at Rio, then got out of the bedroom to get her stuff from the studio.</p><p align="left">Rio exhaled a shaking breath once Agatha was out of the room. She was painfully aware of how turned on she was. So much that she might explode if Agatha only looked at her again.</p><p align="left">Rio wanted to touch herself, but she thought, if she was going to do that, Agatha should be there too. To give her a show. Not to torture Agatha in any way, but because Rio truly wanted to offer herself to her.</p><p align="left">After a couple of minutes, Rio was lying there. Trying to keep her hands to herself.</p><p align="left">Agatha was back, both of her hands were holding things, a cigarette between her lips and that goddamn shirt was still open and only hanging on her shoulders.</p><p align="left">The sight of her pale skin and the valley between her breasts weren't helping Rio in any way. </p><p align="left">Rio's breath hitched, her heart pounded in her chest and she swallowed so hard when Agatha sat on the chair, facing her and looking at her like… <em>that</em>.</p><p align="left">Without saying anything—not a single word came out of Agatha’s throat, she held the charcoal pencil between her fingers and sketched lightly.</p><p align="left">Every time she glanced at Rio, Rio felt her body being set on fire. Every part of her was burning, begging for the fire to be put out. Craving Agatha’s touch.</p><p align="left">Rio’s hands were twitching. Her muscles were tense. Her lips were dry and she was dripping nonstop.</p><p align="left">Agatha was focused on drawing, her fingers moving, her lip between her teeth and she hadn’t glanced at Rio in almost a minute.</p><p align="left">So Rio moved her hand down on her body, lower, almost reaching her heat.</p><p align="left">And Agatha looked up at her. Straight into her eyes.</p><p align="left">“I love you.” She confessed with a sharp, clear voice.</p><p align="left">Rio’s hand froze in place above her pubic bone. Her entire body froze, unable to move.</p><p align="left">She blinked several times as her brow frowned. An overwhelming amount of feelings washed over her. And the words rang in her head.</p><p align="left">“What?” Rio's voice was barely above a whisper as their eyes remained locked.</p><p align="left">“I love you, Rio.”</p><p align="left">Her heart was racing in her chest. Hearing the words again didn't help. And hearing Agatha saying her name like that didn't help either.</p><p align="left">Her breaths were uneven and her chest was rising and falling heavily. Heavier than any time before.</p><p align="left">She propped on her arms and put her leg down, still looking at Agatha. </p><p align="left">She felt herself panicking, unable to breathe or think properly. The words rang in her head and Agatha's voice as well.</p><p align="left">Those words she'd been wanting to say for a long time now. The words that rested on the tip of her tongue and got swallowed so many times to be counted.</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't say anything more, she just looked at Rio. Then she got up from the chair she was sitting on and walked across the bed to where Rio was lying.</p><p align="left">Rio just looked at her. Unable to do anything.</p><p align="left">She was frozen and floating and drowning and feeling everything, every emotion all at once. </p><p align="left">Agatha approached her.</p><p align="left">And Rio was quick to take her hand and pull her in with a kiss that was desperate and filled with disbelief.</p><p align="left">She pulled Agatha more until she was on top of her. Their faces less than a breath apart.</p><p align="left">“I love you too. I love you, Agatha. I love you.”</p><p align="left">Her tears fell down, she couldn't hold them back any longer. </p><p align="left">They were fast and hot and honest.</p><p align="left">She felt herself not just saying a word. Not just confessing something. Not just feeling. </p><p align="left">No, it was more than that.</p><p align="left">It meant that Rio was able to love with certainty and honesty and sincerity.</p><p align="left">That her heart was truly beating for Agatha and Agatha only. And only at that moment she realized that she could show that and make Agatha feel it and see it too by saying the words she thought she wouldn't be able to say.</p><p align="left">But they came out with ease, because they were real, coming from a deep place inside her.</p><p align="left">“I love you, Agatha.” She repeated the confession once more before pulling Agatha in for another desperate and deep kiss. As if she couldn't believe herself saying the words out loud.</p><p align="left">Every time her heart pounded because of Agatha, Rio felt like she finally could show it. Translate it into words.</p><p align="left">Rio wanted to say those exact same words the day she woke up for the first time in Agatha’s bed. Those three words were living deep inside her, waiting to be released. </p><p align="left">Waiting for Rio to gather her courage and say them out loud.</p><p align="left"><em>I love you.</em></p><p align="left">They kissed and Rio didn't try to switch their positions. She wanted Agatha to be on top of her. She wanted to be able to look up at Agatha.</p><p align="left">She moved her hands up and took Agatha’s shirt off her shoulders.</p><p align="left">Then they pulled back and Rio moaned instinctively.</p><p align="left">“Touch me. Please, touch me, my love.” She pleaded with heavy breaths and a rapid heartbeat.</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't wait any longer, her mouth was on Rio’s and her hand was drifting lower. Determined to satisfy Rio's needs immediately. </p><p align="left">Rio lifted her leg up again, inviting with want. With desperation. With need. Her need to feel Agatha, to feel the words on her body after they’ve been said.</p><p align="left">She moaned loudly the moment Agatha slid two of her fingers with ease inside Rio.</p><p align="left">“I could feel you inside me. I could see myself in your eyes. I could… feel my heart beat for you.” Rio mumbled, almost incoherently. The words were mixed with moans, whimpers, heavy breaths and tears.</p><p align="left">But the way Agatha was looking down at her? It showed that the words reached her deeply even if they were incoherent and Rio was inhaling and exhaling before every syllable.</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh god, Agatha. Oh, my god, Agatha.</em>” She moaned as she closed her eyes.</p><p align="left">Her words and warm breaths were hitting Agatha’s parted lips.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't even know if she was pleading a god out there, or begging the goddess on top of her.</p><p align="left">“<em>My love.</em>” Agatha said and it hit Rio’s heart immediately. The same way Agatha’s thrusts inside her weren’t only hitting her g-spot. She was truly feeling Agatha inside her. In so many ways.</p><p align="left">Rio felt tears falling down on her face from above that weren’t hers. So her eyes snapped open—and she saw Agatha’s beautiful, enchanting blue eyes, glassy with tears. Her tears falling straight down on Rio’s skin.</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh, my love.</em>” </p><p align="left">Rio’s tears were falling down on her face so fast, mixing with Agatha’s falling down on her.</p><p align="left">She lifted her hand and clung to Agatha’s shoulder. The other was softly brushing Agatha’s tears away.</p><p align="left">Both of their bodies were shaking—and the bed beneath them as well. </p><p align="left">Agatha’s long hair was falling down by her sides, tickling Rio’s skin gently.</p><p align="left">“I love your blue eyes. I love your dark hair. I love your voice when you call my name. I love your nose. Your face. Your body. I love everything about you. I love you, Agatha.” Rio breathed out every sentence, and she came with a loud moan while saying Agatha’s name out loud. </p><p align="left">And Agatha’s pace remained the same, feeling Rio’s body shaking with the intensity of her orgasm beneath her. And she didn't slow down a second. She moved her body lower, her other hand stroking Rio’s sides.</p><p align="left">Agatha was between Rio’s legs, spreading them widely with her free hand. She got out of bed for a second, not even giving Rio the chance to whine at the loss and unpleasant emptiness.</p><p align="left">Agatha sat down on the floor in front of the edge of the bed and pulled Rio’s body toward her. Rio’s lower body was in the air, her hips were jerking up constantly, shaking and twitching and her cunt was directed straight at Agatha’s face.</p><p align="left">“Fuck, baby,” Rio moaned as she felt Agatha’s fingers filling her up again. As if she couldn't handle the thought of leaving Rio empty when she could fill her over and over <em>and</em> over again.</p><p align="left">“Open your legs wider for me, <em>my love.</em>” </p><p align="left">Rio once again felt the words striking her heart, and she obeyed with desperation. Spread her legs as wide as she could, feeling all of her muscles tensing and only her toes were hitting the floor.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in, kissing Rio’s thighs tenderly. Biting the soft flesh and leaving her marks lovingly.</p><p align="left">She leaned in even closer, and her mouth connected with Rio’s sensitive clit that was intensely and constantly throbbing.</p><p align="left">Rio cried out the moment Agatha started thrusting inside her with two of her long fingers and sucking on her throbbing clit with urgency.</p><p align="left">“God, fuck…” The words were stuck in her throat and she was only managing to moan and cry out loud.</p><p align="left">Rio tried propping her body on her arms to see Agatha, but the moment she did so, Agatha sucked on her clit, and Rio's stomach muscles tensed and burned, so she threw her head back on the bed helplessly.</p><p align="left">And Agatha kept her pace, determined to make Rio come with a massively intense orgasm.</p><p align="left">She was close. <em>So close</em>. The pleasure waiting on the tips of her entire body to be pushed forward and flood her completely.</p><p align="left">With a few more thrusts and sucks, Rio came with a loud curse.</p><p align="left">Agatha removed her fingers and lowered her mouth down. Her long tongue started thrusting inside, and her thumb was rubbing on Rio’s clit.</p><p align="left">“Baby, please. I can't,” Rio pleaded, and even though one of Agatha’s hands was on her hips to keep her body down, her hips were jerking up in the air.</p><p align="left">Agatha lifted her head up and looked at Rio.</p><p align="left">“You can. Just this one,” her voice was soft, as if she were begging to make Rio come. Desperate to do so.</p><p align="left">And Rio only moaned. Because she didn't really want Agatha to pull back.</p><p align="left">Agatha was back on her. Lips and tongue and fingers.</p><p align="left">She took her tongue out of Rio's entrance again and replaced it with three of her fingers, stretching Rio even more. Making her mumble and moan out incoherent words.</p><p align="left">After another thrust, Agatha took her fingers out and just kept rubbing on the throbbing clit. She lifted her eyes up to look at Rio, then down at how her walls were clenching around nothing.</p><p align="left">And Rio came with a forceful gush, soaking Agatha’s cleavage wet. </p><p align="left">Rio’s body was trembling—she couldn't even know what to do with her body. And the moment Agatha licked her slit with the length of her tongue, Rio lost it all.</p><p align="left">She was cursing. Moaning. Breaths uneven. Tears falling down her face from the delicious intensity she was feeling.</p><p align="left">Her body calmed down after a while, and Agatha started pressing soft kisses on the inside of her thighs all the way up to between Rio's breasts. Every kiss was filled with devotion.</p><p align="left">Then she got up on her feet and helped Rio adjust her body on the bed.</p><p align="left">Agatha took her shorts and underwear off as their eyes were staring into each other’s.</p><p align="left">Rio was trying to steady her breaths as she looked at <em>her love</em> with a tired smile.</p><p align="left">Then Agatha got into bed with her, and their mouths connected with a deep tender kiss. Sharing Rio’s taste as their tongues tangled languidly. </p><p align="left">“I love you,” Agatha said, tucking a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. Then started stroking her face gently with the back of her hand.</p><p align="left">Rio closed her eyes. She would never get tired of hearing those words. Every time Agatha said them, her heart would race in her chest.</p><p align="left">“I love you too.”</p><p align="left">Agatha inhaled sharply through her nose as she pulled Rio’s body closer to her, making Rio’s head rest on her bare, warm chest.</p><p align="left">And Rio was able to hear how Agatha’s heart was in the same racing condition as hers.</p><p align="left">“Are you hungry?” Agatha asked softly, brushing Rio’s hair soothingly.</p><p align="left">“Can we eat later? I want to stay like this for a little longer.” </p><p align="left">“Anything you want, my love.”</p>

<p align="left">Rio Vidal had never understood feelings in general. She'd never comprehended what they actually were .She was able to feel them, experience and express them—the bitter and the sweet ones—but never understood them. She could define each one of them accurately. Give a handful of synonyms to each emotion. Explain what they were biologically and psychologically, but the issue that she’d never found a solution to was how and why all of them burdened her at some point. One way or another. Everything overwhelmed her, no matter the amount of it or the intention behind it. She found it all overwhelming in a way she couldn't handle and had never known how to contain within limits. Everything slipped and ran out of her hand like a liquid. She knew it could adapt to the shape of its container, but the paradox was that she couldn't find the damn right container. Things always spilled and adapted a chaotic, unplanned shape. Not that she ever planned something and it actually went according to her plans anyway.</p><p align="left">No matter what the feeling was, the terrifying process of experiencing it inside her body would always be the same. Whether, by definition, it was a positive or a negative one, it was all equivalently consuming.</p><p align="left">She always felt it. The feeling would creep slowly inside her body, run in her veins and ride the waves of her blood. Starting in her heart—and it would clench in her chest. Thereupon to pump inside her lungs—when she'd suffocate and struggle to breathe. Then it would turn back to her heart, making it clench tighter for a good, nocuous mesure. Thus, the feelings would pump inside her whole body, nauseating and unbearable. Then eventually, like a combusting whack, it would reach her head, where it would analyze everything, throb and react. There, where lay everything that would make her miserable, simply for just <em>feeling</em>. Which—being miserable—was also a feeling. And it would remain like that, coursing with her blood circulation. Inside, where nothing could be visible and everything was fucking <em>felt</em>. Until, occasionally, it all would appear on her face and dragged out of her throat. She would sometimes weep uncontrollably, shout and scream loudly with rage and desperation. But most of the time, she kept it inside, eating her alive until she'd be alone and take it all on herself in different ways. By consuming alcohol to numb it all momentarily. Neglecting and lothating herself to let it rot. Letting her body struggle—physically and mentally—or the many other ways she adopted as methods of coping over the years. Ways of surviving in the face of simply, <em>feeling</em>.</p><p align="left">Feelings were wicked. All of them. Whether they provided her a temporary happiness or a long-living sorrow and agony. The countless days and nights tormented her ashen body and forsaken soul. When she wished she would turn cold the next day. To be uncaring and distant even from herself. To just be living in this big melancholic world, just another number of a person, until the day for her would come. To be withdrawn <em>slowly</em>, then she'd be one with the void. Rio never cared about the world losing another person—losing her—because she never considered it losing in the first place. Many died every millisecond and doubles were born in the same exact damn millisecond. So it wasn't that big of a deal.</p><p align="left">The only thing she wished, the only emotion she wanted and <em>begged</em> her body to feel, was the bliss of complete numbness. Something to match her long-lasting loneliness that she felt even in the middle of a teeming place. Amongst a crowd she didn't belong to. Because Rio never belonged.</p><p align="left">The people who Rio was able to express her emotions to weren’t people she found by herself and decided to go toward. To just speak out her mind and express what she felt for them. They always—<em>always</em>—came to her. Whether she wanted them to come or not. The good and the dreadful ones. They always approached her first. She was never the one who started things first. She didn't come first even in contexts like these.</p><p align="left">She always felt herself driven. Sailing with the flow in a boat with holes and no oars by her sides. There was no way to reach a destination where she could land and just simply walk with bare feet.</p><p align="left">But all of it turned out just fine, or at least, that was what she repeated to herself over and over again. That everything went in its own way and led her so she could be here. To be what she was. Even if she didn't approve of where she stood or who she was as a person, she still took it. All the traumatic events she went through. All the disappointments she experienced, and the reckless, unreasonable things she did, they guided her to stand in the mark she was standing on. Which didn't mean anything and it wasn't much by all means, but it was fine. She accepted it with exhaustion, without making peace with it, because that was the only thing she was able to do.</p><p align="left"><em>But </em>love<em>.</em></p><p align="left">Love? Unquestionably, that one was dangerous.</p><p align="left">Because just like how immensely she felt everything, love took the same overwhelming pattern—only worse.</p><p align="left">If she felt love toward someone or something? That meant being exposed fully. It meant being unguarded, unraveled. It meant her body and soul would react immediately, without giving her the chance to even hold the weight inside, to measure it and make sure of how heavy and overwhelming all of it was.</p><p align="left">Rio loved so deeply. Deep enough to be hurt beyond healing. Her love was aching. The scarring kind. She loved with all of her senses, and the worst part? She attached easily. And she was all aware of it. But what would being aware do in front of being helpless?</p><p align="left">Rio knew the chaotic and overwhelming side of loving. Nothing other than that. And that was her only view of it. All the movies she watched under the romance genre—which were many, because she always touched something through them, something untouchable—all the feelings they tried showing through rehearsed scripts and beautiful cinematography—she was aware those weren’t real. Not what love actually felt and looked like. Not what she experienced her entire life. Because all of it was written beforehand after all.</p><p align="left">She knew love, that cursed feeling. Rio experienced it. Her body got infected with it more than once. It was more of a disease than a feeling. Love was ugly. It was painful. There were times she wished she hadn’t had the ability to love so she wouldn't have to suffer because of it. Wouldn't have to deal with the sorrowful aftermath of it.</p><p align="left">Because she knew, if a thing went wrong, just a tiny little error in the enormous system, it would lead to a total collapse. It meant wreck and destruction. It meant suffering, and suffering was never good unless you were a tortured artist.</p><p align="left">She loved three times. Three women in three different, cursed periods of her life. </p><p align="left">One of them was Alice, which was the only relationship Rio made peace with, because at the time she was young and <em>way</em> too oblivious of how fucked everything was. Including herself.</p><p align="left">The other two? Disasters.</p><p align="left">Nightmares she wanted nothing but to run away from. To just wake up and escape them.</p><p align="left">One relationship that lasted nearly a year, but moving on? The process of getting rid of the feelings she had? They lasted longer. Way longer.</p><p align="left">Then years later, Jane appeared. Fucking Jane.</p><p align="left">A troubled woman Rio fell for because she was nothing but a pathetic, desperate fool. A woman that dragged her through every layer of hell.</p><p align="left">The hate she had toward love feelings—she predominantly experienced with people. Other fellow human beings. Because plants and inanimate objects? The things she experienced solitude with? Those were the most appreciative and grateful. No matter how small and trivial they were. They never kissed goodbye, they kiss in their own ways and remain to give more than what they take.</p><p align="left">And Rio just kept looking at the picture in that way most of her life. To the point she didn't remember anything that had existed before it, because she always seemed to see it that way. Her eyes always gazed forward.</p><p align="left">And then <em>Agatha</em> arrived.</p><p align="left">With ease and tenderness she turned the picture around. To its actual face. And revealed what it held. What it should always have been.</p><p align="left">A scenery of something real, something that always existed and was there. Not out of this world, not fiction. Yet it was arresting in its conspicuous, exquisite reality.</p><p align="left">Because apparently, Rio was only gazing at the back of a picture hanging on a plain wall. And she was too convinced that this was it, to the point she didn't question it any more. She just sat and stared forward. Trying so desperately to make sense of it even if it lacked any common sense. </p><p align="left">But that was what you do when you limit yourself, wasn't it? When you get exhausted and start trying to convince yourself with something nonsensical, that even you don't understand—just so you could sit down and stop thinking about it. Taking hold of the fallacious so you could rest. Then you realize that it only took a simple move. Just a shift to make it obvious for you. To make you really rest, body and soul.</p><p align="left">And that was what Agatha did. With a tender shift, she showed Rio that everything could change to the way she wanted. That feelings shouldn't always be overwhelming. Life wasn't always mournful and unfair. Healing shouldn't cost more than being hurt. And that her existence meant something. Her journey wasn't nothing even if she took a path that made her struggle—a path that forced her to think less of herself. Agatha showed her that she deserved to take, to be loved, to be embraced. And if something happened, if that day came, she wouldn't just float away to the void. Rio would be lost. Not as a number, but as a goddamn human being.</p><p align="left"><em>And </em>love<em>.</em></p><p align="left">Just by existing, Agatha made Rio realize that she could love. Could say the words out loud, express them and act upon them. She made her realize that her ability to love was something to be cherished and not chained down. Something to be proud of. Something human. Something Agatha was ready and willing to take inside her, no matter how deep it was.</p><p align="left">There, maybe she found a container.</p><hr/><p align="left">“Shit, I neglected them for so long.” Rio said as she ran a muddy hand through her hair perturbedly. Her other hand continued running in a dainty path through the discoloured leaves. She was looking at them for a long time, crouching in front of a pot, trying just to know what caused her dear plants to turn like this. Unable to figure out if it was because of improper watering—because she was busy and forgot to do so in the past few days—or if they were diseased.</p><p align="left">“Even though I really know <em>absolutely</em> nothing about plants… but it's gonna be okay, baby. Do you know what happened to them?” Agatha said with a soft tone in an attempt to calm Rio a bit. Her voice was so soft, landing on Rio’s ears like a sterling melody, causing her heart to flutter in her chest. She closed her eyes briefly and exhaled a deep breath, because yes, Agatha’s voice did <em>that much</em> to her.</p><p align="left">Rio opened her eyes again as she moved her hands through the leaves of the other plant that was suffering the same discolorations. She felt regret creeping inside her, mixing with the anxiousness and frustration she was feeling with herself, because how did she forget to check on them for days?</p><p align="left">Agatha took a step toward her in the indoor garden and put her hand on Rio’s shoulder in reassurance, and Rio exhaled as she lifted her muddy hand to put above Agatha’s.</p><p align="left">Rio looked up at her with a slight pout. Looking at Agatha’s wide, soft eyes and staring straight at the heartwarming gleam they held inside. Her eyes drifted down to look at how Agatha’s bottom lip was between her teeth, slightly biting down on it while looking down at Rio, who was still crouching in front of a probably dying plant.</p><p align="left">And despite her frustration with herself, and how bad it hurt to look at the condition of her plants that she abandoned for a little too long, Rio smiled at her. An honest, soft smile that reached all the way up to her eyes. Because no matter how bad it was, looking at Agatha and that reassuring look in her eyes? That was all she needed to be reminded that everything will be fine. And by everything, it meant <em>everything.</em></p><p align="left">Rio scraped her hands off to get most of the soil off her fingers. “Well, this is a murder case,” she said as she clapped her hands on her thighs and took a last look at the leaves, scanning them with her eyes. Then she got up, facing Agatha.</p><p align="left">She looked straight into Agatha’s eyes with a grin as she wiped her hands on the sides of her shirt, trying to get the rest of the soil off.</p><p align="left">“Is it that bad?” Agatha asked as she leaned in and put both of her hands on Rio’s hips and pulled her closer. Moving her thumbs in soothing patterns on Rio’s hip bones while looking at her. Searching her face with her eyes for any sign of distress, because she knew how much Rio’s plants meant to her. Each one of them. Every flower, leaf, petiole, stem and root. Every pot and vase.</p><p align="left">She knew gardening wasn't just a little part of Rio’s life. Not just a hobby she picked to spend her time with. She knew this place was Rio’s sanctuary. A sacred part not just in her house, but in her entire life. Agatha fathomed with contentment the love and warmth that bounced from Rio’s eyes and varnished her words. The delicateness in her voice whenever she brought up this topic. Whenever she decided to talk about this particular side of her life and personality. And she understood the time and tenacity Rio put in all of this, not to build, but to <em>grow</em> something. How she used this spot as a place to unleash all of the feelings she was able to feel but never knew how to contain. Things that were holding her captive. Agatha knew that this was one of the few containers Rio was able to find and to actually use. Something she grew by herself.</p><p align="left">Rio inhaled deeply as she looked at the plants behind her once again, then she exhaled a warm breath as she turned around to look back at Agatha.</p><p align="left">“Yes, but… I can handle it. I think. I shouldn't have left them for so long. It's just the delicate ones. They're needy, and I didn't consider the change of the weather in here. It slipped out of my mind… also because I forgot to water them properly.” Rio said, as she ran her hand through her hair. Looking straight into Agatha’s eyes. Those beautiful eyes that were embracing her with their warmth.</p><p align="left">“Is it because you were spending so much time at my place?” Agatha asked, with a hint of a pout on her lips as she squeezed Rio’s hips gently and pulled her even closer.</p><p align="left">And <em>god</em>, how adorable she looked like this.</p><p align="left">Rio smiled at her as she lifted one of her hands and tucked a stray strand of dark hair behind Agatha’s ear with the back of her hand, so she wouldn't smear her beautiful face with the soil that was still coating her fingers. Then she started brushing her knuckles softly against Agatha’s cheek.</p><p align="left">“No, baby. I don't think so.” She smiled as her eyes drifted briefly to look down at Agatha’s mouth.</p><p align="left">Well yes, it was half the truth. Part of it was because she was spending so much time at Agatha’s. She was forgetting because she was sleeping and going to work from Agatha’s house, since it was closer to the university than her own. She was occupied most of the time with her—all day—and that was heavenly. She wasn't complaining, she didn't want it to stop at all. But Rio also knew the actual reason for why she wasn't checking that much on her plants. It has been months, and not just a few days. Even before meeting Agatha, way before that. She was just looking at the big green ones in front of her eyesight—the ones that didn't seem to be affected by her uncaring so far—and she forgot the small ones. The ones that were still trying to grow. The hiding, demanding, delicate ones that implored her caring hands and time. </p><p align="left">“No, I think it is, baby.” Agatha said with a soft, knowing smile as she continued drawing patterns with her thumbs above the fabric of Rio’s brown shirt. “If it makes you feel any better… the two plants in my house… they look a bit like this one.” She said, glancing at the plants behind Rio for a good measure.</p><p align="left">Rio chuckled at the delivery. “I've been watering and taking care of yours. They're healing.”</p><p align="left">“Oh? I didn't know about that.”</p><p align="left">“You haven't noticed? The one in your studio was literally dying. That poor thing.”</p><p align="left">“No, I noticed that one, I thought it was just how it was supposed to look. Recovering by itself or something. Like tomatoes, <em>maybe</em>?” Agatha’s tone wasn't sure, and that made Rio smile because of how adorable the woman in front of her looked.</p><p align="left">God, how she loved her.</p><p align="left">“Like tomatoes?” Rio chuckled in confusion.</p><p align="left">Agatha met her gaze. “You know, they stitch themselves when their skin cracks. Something like that. I read it somewhere. It's phenomenal.” She said as she took both of Rio’s hands and put them on her hips. Not seeming to care about soiling her green tank top—Rio’s tank top. The one that she grabbed from Rio’s hold when she was about to put it on this morning. Agatha wore it herself so Rio wouldn't wear it and would remain shirtless, as if Rio didn't have any other clothes in her own house. But she did remain shirtless most of the day, because she liked the way Agatha kept looking at her for hours, until she put a shirt on after Alice video-called her.</p><p align="left">“Yes, they do. But it's a different deal. Most of my plants need time, and they demand care and patience. You know, just like when you meet someone new… another human being. It's the same. But plants are actually way more interesting.”</p><p align="left">“Oh, I see. They give things in return, don't they? They don't just take. Plants, I mean.”</p><p align="left">“Yes, exactly. And they give <em>way</em> more than what they take. So it's unfair to neglect them.” Rio said with a fond smile as their eyes locked. </p><p align="left">“Mhm.” Agatha hummed softly, a smile planted on her lips as she slowly started swaying their bodies without a rhythm. Just moving their hips while staring into each other’s eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio leaned in and rested her head on Agatha’s chest. The movements of their bodies continued as she lifted her hands up and held Agatha’s back to pull her closer to her body. To hold onto her. To feel her warmth. To take her in.</p><p align="left">To listen to how her heart was beating, because that was the only rhythm Rio wanted to sway her body to while she was in Agatha’s hold. The sound of Agatha’s breaths. Her soft hum. Her heartbeat. The rising and falling of her chest.</p><p align="left">And Agatha embraced her back with warmth, with love, as she put her hand on the back of Rio’s head. Securing it in her hold. Agatha leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to her temple, then she started moving her fingers in Rio’s dark hair soothingly.</p><p align="left">Rio exhaled a warm breath on Agatha’s collarbones. Feeling her body relax in Agatha’s tight, loving embrace. Her tranquilizing scent filled her senses—the scent that she grew addicted to.</p><p align="left">“I used to garden a lot when I was a teenager. Even when I was a kid,” Rio broke the silence, her voice was low and calming. Feeling herself growing more and more content. All the tension in her muscles was nowhere to be felt. And the weight of her exhausting week was decreasing.</p><p align="left">“But when I was a teenager, it was different. Gardening was part of the therapy plan and a big part of my life… it's the only thing that ever worked with me. It's just, so… <em>gratifying</em>, you know?” she resumed, as their bodies continued swaying to the melody of their steady breaths. “It makes me feel good, to just… do something. It isn't just my hands that are working but my whole body. And then… to see the result of it after trusting the process, after putting in so much time and care. It looks back at you, and you realize that nothing goes to a waste. Seeing a result of something you did with so much love and patience, and it stares back at you, embraces you back, but differently. In that thing’s own way. You know what I mean, or is it nonsense?” Rio said as she embraced Agatha tighter. Feeling the bones of Agatha’s shoulder blades in her hold. Brushing her fingers lightly on them.</p><p align="left">“No, baby. I downright know what you mean. I feel that way when I'm painting something. Especially the stuff that I don't display anywhere, because I do it for the sake of it. The sake of creating something and feeling it consumes you whole while doing it—and you consume it in return... but in a different form. You know, like it's a process of giving and taking at the same time. And it really feels good. Like you said, it stares back at me and embraces me differently in its own way. It <em>is</em> gratifying.”</p><p align="left">“Mhm.” Rio responded, her smile was visible in her hum.</p><p align="left">She lifted her head up and looked at Agatha with the same soft smile. The movements of their bodies stilled, and their hands on each other's bodies remained and tightened on their spots as their eyes locked. </p><p align="left">Rio leaned in and brushed the tips of their noses briefly, feeling the warm, soft exhales of Agatha’s parted lips on her own.</p><p align="left">Then her mouth was on Agatha’s, taking her lips in a tender kiss. Agatha’s lips were plump and so addictive to kiss. It was addictive to feel the warmth and the softness of them against hers. Rio was tightly grabbing the fabric of Agatha’s tank top, clenching it in her fists as the kiss deepened. Her tongue slid inside fondly. Invited and welcomed. Tangling with Agatha’s with heat and desire. The taste of the peach Agatha ate earlier lingered—rich and sweet, mixing with the warmth and the taste of her mouth. Rio closed her eyes as she continued kissing her—her fingers never stopped their movements up and down Agatha’s shoulder blades. Agatha allowed her to take, as deep and tender as she wanted. She only followed the pace and depth Rio set and kissed her back in the same way. Tenderly and lovingly.</p><p align="left">Rio pulled her head back slightly, her eyes were half-lidded and gleaming. And so were Agatha's.</p><p align="left">She ran her tongue on her own lips, tasting Agatha on them. Fucking sweet.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">Their smiles mirrored.</p><p align="left">“Talking about your plants, who gave them to you?” Rio’s voice was low and quiet as she moved her hands all the way down from Agatha’s back, slowly, going lower, until her palms rested on Agatha’s hips once again. Holding her tightly, pulling her body closer.</p><p align="left">“The one in the studio, Lilia gave it to me even though she knew damn well I won't be able to keep it alive.” Agatha said with a timid smile, the unsteadiness of her breaths visible in her voice. “And the one in the living room…” Agatha paused for a second to lick her lips. She moved her thumb up to wipe the edge of her mouth and Rio whined involuntarily, feeling her eyes blink and her heart flutter in her chest like a bird fluttering its wings in excitement. Agatha smirked as she placed one of her hands on the back of Rio’s neck and gently pushed her head closer to her face. Their chests were flush against each other. “Well, the one in the living room, I bought it. And honestly? I still don't know why. I just wanted to use that vase, I guess. It fits though, doesn't it?” She resumed as she leaned her face closer, their hot breaths mingling. </p><p align="left">“Yes, it does.” Rio said with a smile as she leaned in and pressed another soft kiss to Agatha’s lips.</p><p align="left">Before Rio could pull back, Agatha tightened her hold and deepened the kiss. Her tongue slid inside Rio’s parted lips as she tilted her head slightly to the side. The kiss grew deeper in a second. More desperate and heated. And it escalated to be messier. Filthier. </p><p align="left">Agatha’s hands were everywhere on Rio’s body—on her hips, her back, her shoulders, her neck, and they rested on the small of her back under her shirt. Agatha's fingers ran soothingly and deliberately on Rio's hot skin.</p><p align="left">They pulled back briefly, a string of warm, silky silva on their bottom lips connecting their mouths. And they looked into each other’s half-lidded, lustful eyes.</p><p align="left">“<em>I love you.</em>” Rio said with a low, aroused voice, meant only for Agatha’s ears. Her breaths were unsteady and her heartbeats were rapid.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s eyes fluttered, and she pulled Rio in for another short kiss. “<em>I love you too.</em>” She said through a whisper, right on Rio’s mouth. Both the words and Agatha’s warm breaths vibrated on her parted lips and made Rio’s heart tighten in her chest.</p><p align="left">She'd never get used to the way those words made her feel.</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled her head back slightly, just an inch. She tilted her head to the side again and looked at Rio with hungry eyes—a look Rio knew all too well—and it immediately made her heart clench in her chest and caused her walls to clench around nothing. She swallowed hard as she looked at Agatha’s eyes scanning her face. Looking at every spot and feature, but mostly gazing at her mouth. Rio licked her lips to wet them, and Agatha smirked with a raised brow. Her lips were far from dry and her mouth was constantly watering, she was almost drooling for god's sake, but the way Agatha was intensely looking at her made her head stop functioning.</p><p align="left">Agatha rested one of her hands on the back of Rio’s neck again, moving her palm up and down the scorching skin, while her other hand remained under Rio’s shirt. Her fingers moved with delicate urgency on her spine.</p><p align="left">“You're so beautiful, my love,” Agatha said as she slid half of her leg between Rio’s and she secured her weight with her holds. Agatha’s gaze was locked on Rio’s parted lips. The way they were pink and swollen. Devourable.</p><p align="left">“Stick your tongue out for me.” She whispered the command right on Rio's mouth. Causing a shiver to run down her spine, making her tremble in Agatha’s hold.</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed down and obliged the next second. Sticking her tongue out.</p><p align="left">“<em>Good girl.</em>” Agatha praised with a smirk, making Rio moan helplessly.</p><p align="left">Then she leaned in and caught the tip of Rio’s tongue between her teeth. Biting vaguely on the fleshy organ but not pressing too much to hurt. Agatha hollowed her cheeks and grabbed Rio’s tongue between her lips and started sucking on it with her whole mouth. Thrusting Rio’s tongue in and out frantically. Fucking her mouth with it as one of her hands pressed on Rio’s back and the other slid down from her neck to hold her hip tightly.</p><p align="left">Rio felt the tip of her tongue hitting the warm walls of Agatha’s mouth with every thrust, and it was maddening, how she was dripping down uncontrollably. Feeling the heat in her abdomen and between her thighs increasing. And she, with desperation, jerked her hips forward, trying to chase the ghost of a fraction. Signaling for Agatha to direct her thigh where she desirously needed that strong muscle to be. But Agatha didn't move her leg at all, she just kept it there and continued sucking. Filling their ears with an obscene symphony.</p><p align="left">Every time Agatha leaned her face forward to suck in and take the whole length of Rio’s tongue inside her mouth, their swollen lips connected briefly and Rio felt her legs unable to hold her weight any longer. Her knees were buckling and her whole body was shaking, ready to collapse. The heat she was feeling in her stomach was burning. Wild and untamed. She was feeling how drenched she already was, but unable to even bring her thighs together. But Agatha’s tight holds on her body kept her standing on her feet.</p><p align="left">Rio’s moans were swallowed down, the only audible sound was Agatha’s mouth taking her whole tongue in and out with vehemence. When Rio tried—with choking, lustful desperation—to move her tongue and tangle it with Agatha’s in the inch of space that was appearing between their faces with every suck, Agatha squeezed her hip firmly in warning, and Rio obeyed immediately. Just standing there with a shaking body, swallowed moans and a dripping cunt. Offering her tongue for Agatha to fuck and devour.</p><p align="left">Agatha tilted her head to the side and took Rio’s mouth in a deep kiss again. Rio felt Agatha’s tongue everywhere inside her mouth and it made her unable to think of anything. Her desire for Agatha was fogging her head. She placed one of her hands on the back of Agatha’s head to push her head closer, and the other rested on the waistband of Agatha’s sweatpants, ready to slide down. Ready to claim. But Agatha stopped her hands in their tracks. She grabbed both of Rio’s wrists and guided her hands to rest on her hips instead.</p><p align="left">“Let me do it, love.” Agatha whispered as their eyes locked. Her words were hot on Rio’s parted, swollen lips.</p><p align="left">Rio nodded with a whimper into Agatha’s open mouth as she felt Agatha walking them backward in hurried steps. Pulling Rio’s body with her by the hips as their mouths connected in yet another, feverish kiss.</p><p align="left">Agatha pinned Rio on the nearest white wall, not planning on breaking the kiss anytime soon. She took both of Rio’s hands and ushered them to her shoulders so Rio could cling onto them. Then the next second, she lifted and bent up one of Rio’s legs, resting it around her waist while holding it with a tight grasp. Her fingers were digging in the tanned flesh of Rio’s exposed thigh, leaving marks that she would definitely appreciate the look of on Rio's skin later.</p><p align="left">Agatha pushed her hips forward as she pulled her head away. Both of them were panting, struggling to breathe.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s face was flush, her pupils dark and blown widely with lust and yearning. And Rio was... a mess.</p><p align="left">“<em>Baby</em>… we have dinner in...” Rio paused to moan as she felt Agatha moving her hand on her cunt from above her shorts. And she was certain Agatha was feeling the heat radiating from her. Sensing how soaked she was.</p><p align="left">“I know. I'll make it quick.” She slid her fingers inside the hem of the black shorts and started feeling Rio’s cunt from above her underwear. Teasingly, drawing messy patterns and making Rio squirm against the wall. Her body was trembling, already begging for release. </p><p align="left">“<em>Yes, oh fuck… we need to be ready…</em> <em>fuck, baby please.</em>”</p><p align="left">“We have time, my love.” Agatha said as she continued teasing. Her thumb moved up and down her slit, pausing briefly when it reached her clit just to press or tap firmly on it—making Rio twitch in her place, unable to hold back her moans.</p><p align="left">“<em>We…</em>” Rio swallowed, now feeling Agatha’s ring and middle fingers holding the drenched crotch of her underwear, moving up and down against the fabric. Feeling the soft skin of the back of her digits right on her drenched folds. “<em>We don't—fuck me…</em>”</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in to suck on Rio's neck, right under her ear—the spot that she knew would make Rio go insane.</p><p align="left">Rio felt her knees on the verge of giving up, and her body almost slipped from Agatha’s hold, but Agatha was quick to tighten it and dig her short nails in the flesh of Rio’s thigh. </p><p align="left">“We have all the time we need, don't worry,” Agatha whispered right into her ear. “<em>I just want to feel you.</em>” She grazed her earlobe then licked it with her warm tongue.</p><p align="left">Rio closed her eyes shut. Feeling electric waves flowing inside her body. Her chest was rising and falling heavily, and her heart was beating rapidly in her chest.</p><p align="left">“<em>You drive me fucking insane...</em>” Rio said with a helpless, aroused grin. “<em>Take me, Agatha.</em>” She heavily breathed out the words into the dark locks of Agatha's hair that were tickling her face.</p><p align="left">Although she couldn't see Agatha’s face, she knew she was smirking. Smug.</p><hr/><p align="left">Agatha made love to Rio in that indoor garden. Amongst the greenery, dragging out the most symphonic, sinful sounds from her throat. Pulling multiple, crashing orgasms out of her body while she was pinned against the wall or seated on that familiar wooden dresser. So on and so forth. What was supposed to be ‘<em>quick</em>’ work, made them half an hour late for their dinner—double date—with Alice and Jennifer.</p><p align="left">Agatha got out of her car and Rio kept looking at her as she walked across the vehicle to open the door for her. Acting like the gentlewoman that she was. Wearing that Burgundy suit with a white shirt tucked underneath her pants. The color on her made her blue eyes lighter but no less intense and craving. She looked intoxicating.</p><p align="left">Agatha opened the passenger door for Rio and offered her hand for her to take. Their eyes locked as she pressed a gentle kiss to the back of Rio’s hand once it was in her warm hold. Their smiles matched in their softness and warmth.</p><p align="left">Agatha slid her hand under the leather jacket Rio was wearing—the jacket Agatha clung into while kissing Rio with fervency before they got out, not caring about ruining their perfectly applied lipstick. “<em>You should get a motorcycle.</em>” Agatha said with half-lidded eyes and an amusing smirk on her swollen lips. And Rio actually found the suggestion appealing, which earned her a playful raising of eyebrows from Agatha as she grabbed her wrist and stepped out of Rio’s house.</p><p align="left">Agatha held Rio's waist under the leather as they entered the bar Alice had picked—the bar where they first laid eyes on each other. The bar where the stars aligned and fate had been rewritten. Where Rio approached first for probably the first time ever. When she drunkenly murmured, “<em>Gosh, you're gorgeous.</em>” to the most gorgeous human being she had ever seen. Thanks to the alcohol that was in her system at the time, and for how fucking <em>intoxicating</em> Agatha looked. Sobering Rio up and knocking her out the next second. She looked so goddamn enthralling.</p><p align="left">“Whatever stories she tells you about me... don't believe them.” Rio said as they walked forward. Approaching Alice at the end of the booth—who stood up immediately with a bright smile on her face once she saw the couple. And her fianceé beside her stood as well while looking down at her phone.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked at Rio’s side profile with a smirk. “Should I not believe them because they really happened or not?” She asked as she slid her hand down from Rio's waist to hold her hand.</p><p align="left">Rio chuckled. “That's for you to find out, my love. But I warned her not to say anything stupid. Or... to threaten you. She gets weirdly protective sometimes.”</p><p align="left">“Hello, stranger!” Alice greeted as she took Rio in a hug, causing Rio and Agatha's intertwined fingers to loosen and fall in the space between them.</p><p align="left">“Hello, Miss Harkness. Agatha.” Alice said as she took Agatha’s offered hand to shake, then she pulled her in a warm embrace. And that made Rio smile widely, feeling warmth coursing inside her body from looking at them. As if witnessing two of her worlds combine.</p><p align="left">“Sorry, we're late. The traffic was insane.” Rio said with a grin while she embraced Jen. As if she couldn't believe her own lie.</p><p align="left">Agatha greeted Jen as well, then they sat down beside each other, facing the engaged couple.</p><p align="left">Alice was about to get up and bring them drinks. </p><p align="left">“The usual, Rio. Right? And Agatha, what do I get you?”</p><p align="left">Rio looked at Alice. “No, bring me an iced coke.” Alice raised her brow, but didn't say anything.</p><p align="left">Rio took the wise decision she was taking for the past two weeks. She was determined to take the right path of this journey.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her with the softest look and smile ever as she put her hand on Rio’s leg, which started shaking nervously under the table.</p><p align="left">“An iced coke for me too. Thank you, Alice.” Agatha said.</p><p align="left">“You guys must be <em>so</em> fun at parties.”</p><p align="left">That caused Agatha to chuckle and Rio to smile an anxious smile at her friend.</p><p align="left">“No, I just… I'm trying to quit drinking,” Rio admitted. The words somehow felt heavy as they left her throat. Almost choked her. Because she knew Alice. Alice was there with her almost her whole life, and she knew Rio like nobody else did. She saw her messy and wrecked and devastated. Alice knew and saw all the sides and looks of Rio.</p><p align="left">Alice smiled fondly, that bright smile of hers, as she took Rio’s hand between hers. “God, I'm so fucking proud of you.” She said with sincerity. Then her eyes drifted to Agatha. “I'm adoring your affect already.” She said, her eyes were glimmering from the bar lights above their heads and the warmth of the feelings rushing inside her.</p><p align="left">“It's all her, I did nothing.” Agatha met Alice’s gaze with a smile as she started moving her fingers soothingly on Rio’s thigh. “But thank you.”</p><p align="left">They sat down with their drinks. The conversations flowed easily between all four of them, as their food arrived as well.</p><p align="left">Rio wasn't nervous about Agatha meeting her friends—she knew they would get along. And good thing, Alice wasn't fan girling that much. She was just Rio’s best friend, sitting beside her fianceé and talking with Rio’s girlfriend—and not just Agatha Harkness, the artist who they adored for her work.</p><p align="left">And Rio saw how much that meant to Agatha. In the way her eyes were softening and how her body relaxed beside her. Every time Agatha said something or engaged with the conversations, Rio felt her heart beating with so much love inside her chest. Seeing how perfectly Agatha fitted in her world, with ease. Like she'd always been there. And god, how Rio wished she had always been there, in her world. By her side. But now, she really had her. And it warmed her whole being to see Agatha laugh and be herself. With no restraints or heavy, overwhelming weights to hold her down. Rio hadn’t met Agatha’s friends yet, but she wondered inside her head if she'd easily fit there. The same way Agatha did. But she hoped for that. She hoped she would be a piece that would fit on her board.</p><p align="left">“Okay, once, we played in front of a church—”</p><p align="left">“No, Alice. Shut up. Nobody wants to hear that story.” Rio said, raising her finger up for Alice to stop talking, although her smile was visible on her face.</p><p align="left">“I actually want to hear that. Go on babe.” Jen said to her fianceé with a grin. Her eyes were lidded from the alcohol.</p><p align="left">“Me too, if it involves a church and your dykey band.” Agatha joined as she looked at Rio with an anticipated smirk. </p><p align="left">“Guys…”</p><p align="left">“Sorry, Rio. Three against one. Democracy. So… there was a church in the neighborhood…”</p><p align="left">“Fuck you, Alice.” Rio said with a grin as she picked her glass and sipped her coke.</p><p align="left">“Thank you, my dear friend. Now, let me talk. Anyway… the father was so fucking homophobic. Every Sunday he had some trash to throw at gay people—<em>us in particular</em>. Rio was so pissed off with him. She was like... the raging dyke of the neighborhood, or something. Everybody knew her. But her aunt still forced her to go to church every two weeks. While my mother forced me every goddamn Sunday. Anyway, so Rio gathered us during the summer break before college. And she said, ‘<em>Do you guys want to change the world for gay people or not? Because you know what? Punk isn't dead.</em>’ she was acting really serious about it. Pissed off with the whole thing. It was hilarious. But we agreed, because after all, we were just like her and she was our leader in a way. Dragging our asses with her everywhere. Anyway, Chris’s house was across the street, right in front of the church and we held most of our rehearsals in her parents garage.” Alice took a sip of her drink while eyeing Rio—who was trying to act nonchalant about it. But she was grinning, remembering the good, old, rebellious days. </p><p align="left">“We were awake and waiting for the father all morning. Once Rio spotted him, she hurried and struck the strings of her guitar and it was <em>so</em> fucking loud. She said with that tone of her: ‘<em>Hey father, you want to hear something cool?</em>’ He just shook his head and clenched the cross around his neck and prayed. He was so dramatic. So Rio immediately took her shirt off and remained topless…” Agatha gasped and chuckled immediately as she looked at Rio staring at Alice with a wide smile.</p><p align="left">“Alice, end of story. The credits are rolling. Stop.”</p><p align="left">“‘<em>This one's for you, Father!</em>’ Rio yelled into the mic and started singing: ‘<em>I kissed your mom, and she tasted good. Shaking in my hold, she barely stood.</em>’ and she kept repeating the same goddamn phrase over and over again. She was so off tone it was insane and we just went along with her. We had absolutely no idea what the fuck she was trying to prove. Or when she wrote the lyrics in the first place. And she kept going on even after the father got inside and closed the church door in our faces.”</p><p align="left">“I was trying to make a difference! He was so fucking homophobic, I hated him.”</p><p align="left">“Difference my ass, Rio. We were grounded and went to church three days a week for two weeks because of you. And it was our summer break!”</p><p align="left">Agatha laughed, really loud. And so did Jen.</p><p align="left">Rio folded her hands on her chest. “He could suck my dick…” She said, and Agatha’s hand stilled on her thigh as she smirked. Rio swallowed.</p><p align="left">“I should’ve really kissed his mom, though.” </p><p align="left">“She was dead, wasn't she?”</p><p align="left">“No, she wasn't at the time. And she was kinda hot if you think about it.”</p><p align="left">“Fucking freak.” Alice grinned.</p><p align="left">Rio squirmed in her place, feeling Agatha’s fingers moving faster on the fabric of her jeans. Moving lower to rest between her slightly parted thighs under the table. But she moved her hand away entirely after realizing Rio wasn't breathing.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in, “<em>Breathe for me, big boy.</em>” She whispered into Rio's ear. A whisper meant only for Rio. Then she pulled back to resume moving her fingers.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at Agatha’s face and that damn smirk on her lips. She was clenching her glass tightly in her hold, her knuckles turned white. And she did as she was told. Obediently breathing.</p><p align="left">“You still have the photos, though.” Alice said, breaking the heated moment between the two. But the heat Rio was feeling inside only increased.</p><p align="left">“It was a tape.” Rio cleared her throat as Agatha’s fingers slowed down in empathy for Rio’s messy state. “The tapes are with you.” she resumed. </p><p align="left">“Oh yes. But I think Chris took it, no?”</p><p align="left">“She stole it. Yes. And gave it to that fuckass.”</p><p align="left">“Yes! I should definitely tell this story, oh my god, Rio!”</p><p align="left">“Alice! No. For fuck’s sake. Enough with my embarrassing stories. Say something about you for example.”</p><p align="left">“Why? We're having fun. And they're also my stories, I was there.”</p><p align="left">“Nope. That one you're thinking about is <em>specifically</em> mine.” </p><p align="left">“Come on, baby. I want to hear about you in your glorious days.”</p><p align="left">“Exactly, let us honor your punk self, Rio.” Jen added while looking at Agatha.</p><p align="left">They were ganging up on her. So she just sighed in helplessness, giving Alice the cue to embarrass her once again.</p><p align="left">“So, that Chris—she was one of the band members, obviously. And the most annoying one. God, she was unbearable.” Rio nodded at that in agreement. “The three of us were in the same university freshman year, then Rio got transferred the next year. Anyway, there was that guy who was <em>way</em> too obsessed with Rio, from day one. He was a junior and kept running after her even after he saw us kissing. I think he believed he could change her to be heterosexual or something. That dude was really obsessed. So, that Chris. She was in love with him. Cool? Cool. So she decided to take some of our band tapes—especially the ones where Rio was shirtless or acting weird or something, and gave them to him to watch. Like, that girl was seriously troubled and she wanted him to hate Rio so bad. But that dude fell even harder. So once, we were talking on the phone, ready to meet on campus so we could go home at the end of the day. We were looking at each other, waving from a distance. Then he came up to Rio and kneeled in front of her. And in his hand was a bag filled with the tapes. Trying to give them back or something. He was literally proposing to her with her own types.” Alice paused to chuckle. Her eyes drifted to everyone in the booth surrounding her.</p><p align="left">“‘<em>Get up.</em>’ Rio said to him, she was furious and I was fighting myself not to laugh. Hearing how pissed off she was while witnessing the iconic scene right in front of me. He stood on his feet immediately. And once he was up, Rio grabbed the bag and slapped him. I swear, to this day, I could hear the sound ringing in my ear. ‘<em>I'm a lesbian, Isaac. Keep your dick in your pants because I have my own.</em>’ and then she just walked away from him. She traumatized the guy and I never saw him after that day ever again.”</p><p align="left">“Damn, Rio. You don't play,” Jen said with a chuckle.</p><p align="left">“What was I supposed to do? He was annoying.”</p><p align="left">“For personal reasons, I <em>need</em> to see those tapes.” Agatha’s voice was low, almost a whisper. She definitely meant for the words to stay in her head, but they escaped her throat before she could catch them. Rio’s head snapped to look at her. Searching her face and the look in her eyes.</p><p align="left">“You haven't seen them yet? You definitely should, don't let Rio gatekeep them.”</p><p align="left">“By the way, you guys are beautiful together,” Jen said, her eyes gleaming from the alcohol and drifting lazily between them both.</p><p align="left">“Yes. You both are adorable.” Alice agreed.</p><p align="left">“Thank you.” Agatha thanked them and Rio smiled an honest smile in response. Still thinking about what Agatha said.</p><p align="left">“Let's make a toast. Shall we?” Alice said, raising her glass in the air.</p><p align="left">“<em>To you two!</em>”</p><p align="left">And the sound of their glasses clinking blended with their chuckles, filling the atmosphere between them and mixing with the noise of the bar.</p><p align="left">Jen excused herself to the restroom, and Alice followed her after half a minute. Giving Agatha and Rio that look.</p><p align="left">“<em>Solidarity</em>,” She said, raising her fist in the air, causing them both to laugh.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her glass for a sip of her coke that was technically just melted ice.</p><p align="left">“There she is, <em>my icon.</em>” Agatha said with amusement in her voice. Brushing Rio’s cheek with the back of her hand and looking at her with loving eyes.</p><p align="left">“Barely, I was just a repressed teenager.” Rio shrugged.</p><p align="left">“Well, from what I heard so far, you're an icon. And I really, really need to see those tapes.”</p><p align="left">Rio met her gaze. “I didn't show them to you because… I thought they're embarrassing. I mean… teenager me stuff.”</p><p align="left">“I love all of you, Rio. That wasn't embarrassing, it was… sweet and wild. Someone who was strong enough to express themselves. I know why you think it's embarrassing…” She leaned in to press a kiss to Rio’s cheek. “But everything about you is beautiful. Your past and your present. I want it all.”</p><p align="left">Rio smiled, feeling her heart clenching in her chest. She leaned in and took Agatha’s lips in a kiss. That was when Alice and Jen came back, both of them wiping the edges of their mouths with their fingers as they slid in the booth, facing them.</p><p align="left">They didn't pull back immediately, as if the whole world around them ceased to exist, not caring about it. And only when Alice wolf-whistled did they pull back.</p><p align="left">They both smiled, their faces were flush red. Rio grabbed her glass and swirled the melting ice in it.</p><p align="left">“So, Agatha... Are you planning on marrying her?” Alice asked accusingly while narrowing her eyes. A gaze meant only for Agatha.</p><p align="left">Rio coughed immediately at the question, feeling as her heart dropped down in her stomach. Caught off guard. She put both of her palms on the table and stared at Alice in disbelief.</p><p align="left">“What the hell, Alice?” Rio choked on her own words. And Agatha beside her didn't say anything. She was calm as if the question didn't stir her. She placed her hand on Rio’s back and moved her hand in slow movements along her spine as she looked at Alice with a soft smile. </p><p align="left">“What? I'm asking the right questions.”</p><p align="left">“<em>We…</em>” </p><p align="left">“We haven't talked about it, Alice. You know that. What the hell? This is not a right question.” Rio interrupted what Agatha was about to say.</p><p align="left">Agatha exhaled a deep, soft breath. Rio looked at her, noticing that Agatha probably had something else to say, but she cut her off. Rio straightened her posture and looked at Alice, giving her a stern look.</p><p align="left">“Like Rio said, we haven't really talked about that. It's a little early I think. It hasn't come up yet, we're... taking short steps. I love her so much. <em>Rio</em>… she really means the world to me. And we're just trying to figure things out at the moment. We… actually, talked about going to Paris next month…” Agatha looked at Rio, asking her with a look if it was okay to talk. But Rio was still stunned by Alice’s question while feeling heat increasing inside her from hearing how casually Agatha was talking, showing off her love. So she just gestured with her head slightly—not even a nod. Agatha smiled at her as she turned her gaze to Alice and Jen again. Her hand on Rio’s back never stopped moving soothingly.</p><p align="left">“We've known each other for a while now… there are things we need to talk about and yet to discover. To show each other. And I’m willing to do all of this with her—with <em>Rio</em>. I want her to see my world and I would leave the decisions for her to make. I want us to be part of each other’s everything. We're… not running. We're willing to walk the path together. And I want us to be ready for every step we're going to take and not to just… take it.” Agatha inhaled deeply. “I know what you mean with your question, Alice. I know how much you love her. And I know that you... know me. You know things about me… which yes, I'm definitely not proud of. But I want to make all the right decisions, because I love Rio. <em>I really do</em>. And if you… have something to tell me. I'm ready to listen and take it. No matter what it is. You've known Rio for a long time… and I know what you must feel. So when something like that comes up in the future—If we discuss it—I'm sure you'll be the first to know.” Agatha finished, and for some reason the entire bar decided to go quiet around them. The four of them were looking at each other. Back and forth.</p><p align="left">As if something pulled her from her head and back on earth. Rio blinked several times. Then she leaned in, cutting off whatever Alice opened her mouth to say. “<em>I love you so much,</em>” Rio said loudly. She cupped Agatha’s face and pulled her in, their mouths crashed in a kiss. Rio felt like it was the right thing to do. The <em>only</em> thing to do. </p><p align="left">They pulled back before the kiss could deepen and turn into a bedroom-rated one. Agatha smiled softly onto Rio’s lips before pressing a soft peck on her upper lip and pulling her head back slightly.</p><p align="left">“I—I don't think I have anything to say. Or to add. You have my blessing. I just want you guys to be happy.”</p><p align="left">“Thank you, Alice. We appreciate it.” Agatha said, but Rio didn't seem to agree with that.</p><p align="left">She looked at Alice, annoyed. She folded her hands on her chest and wet her lips.</p><p align="left">“I told you not to say anything stupid, didn't I?”</p><p align="left">“Don't yell at my wife,” Jen said as she grabbed Alice closer to her by the waist.</p><p align="left">“She's not your wife, <em>yet</em>.” Rio narrowed her eyes on her.</p><p align="left">“She <em>is</em> my wife.” </p><p align="left">A staring contest was about to be held before Alice decided to interrupt.</p><p align="left">“Yes, baby, I totally get what you mean. But I'm your fianceé, for now.”</p><p align="left">“Talking about that, when are you guys gonna marry? Clearly, Jen can't wait to claim you as her wife.” Rio asked. Her tone changed entirely, as if she forgot what she was annoyed about a second ago.</p><p align="left">“Soon. Jen has some work to do out of the country in the meantime. So when she's done with all of her stressful work. Though… we talked about it a lot. So there won't be a wedding, you know. Just a small party for family and friends. Then the honeymoon. Of course.”</p><p align="left">“I'm really happy for you both.” Agatha smiled sincerely.</p><p align="left">“Thank you.”</p><p align="left">“See? She's technically my wife,” Jen cut through with a drunk chuckle.</p><p align="left">“There's no such thing as <em>technically my wife.</em>”</p><p align="left">“There is.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, kids. Wrap it up.”</p><p align="left">They talked about more, different things here and there. Sharing stories charged with giggles and honest laughter. And their night came to an end.</p><p align="left">They embraced each other with warmth. Each couple thanking the other for the night they had, appreciating their shared company. Their ways parted. Alice and Jen took a cab home since both of them were drunk, almost wasted, and they, with a tipsy smile, declined the ride home Agatha had offered them, deciding to go on their own after they wished each other a good night.</p><p align="left">Rio checked if they were safely seated in the back seat. She said her goodbyes once again, then turned to look at Agatha, who was already looking at her with a fond smile. Folding her arms on her chest. Her eyes were gleaming from the street lights, and the night breeze was gently playing with her dark hair. She looked so beautiful. <em>Ethereal</em>.</p><p align="left">Rio smiled as she took a step toward Agatha and stood facing her.</p><p align="left">Agatha extended both of her arms for Rio to hold, and Rio took her warm hands in hers, intertwining their fingers by their sides.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">Agatha was slightly taller than her because of the heels she was wearing, causing her to look down at Rio.</p><p align="left">“Where are we spending the night, my love?” Agatha asked, leaning her face closer to Rio's.</p><p align="left">Rio smiled, staring up at her beautiful, captivating blue eyes.</p><p align="left">“You're spending it between my arms. In my hold.”</p><p align="left">“Mhm. Sounds tempting.”</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to her cheek, then she started walking them both to the car.</p><p align="left">She opened the passenger door for Rio to get in. And Rio found herself, once again, staring at Agatha walking across the car. Looking effortlessly beautiful.</p><p align="left">Once she got in, Agatha leaned in and kissed the edge of Rio’s mouth. Then she fastened her belt and put her glasses on. Rio’s breath hitched at the sight. </p><p align="left">“Sorry, baby, I don't want to crash us,” Agatha said with a chuckle as she started the engine.</p><p align="left">Although it was teasing, something stirred inside Rio. Knowing this topic wasn't just a teasing thing for Agatha—It was much more—and it made her heart spike. </p><p align="left">So, she half-got up from her seat. Her seatbelt was restraining her. Rio she leaned in closer—although she was aiming for Agatha’s forehead, Rio pressed the kiss on the tip of Agatha’s nose since it was the only spot she could reach from her position.</p><p align="left">Then she sat down after seeing the soft smile appearing on Agatha’s lips.</p><p align="left">“I like Alice,” Agatha said as she drove them out of the parking lot.</p><p align="left">“Yes, I like her too. But... she could be a lot sometimes. You know, she has been with me for a long time. So…”</p><p align="left">“I know. I'm not complaining. I'm ready to hear every story she has to tell.”</p><p align="left">“No, that's never good. She knows <em>way</em> too much. I'm not putting you guys in the same place again.”</p><p align="left">Agatha laughed. The sound was rich and so peaceful to hear. Landing on Rio's ears beautifully.</p><p align="left">“<em>Baby</em>,” She put her hand on Rio’s thigh and started brushing her thumb gently above the fabric. “I love hearing everything about you. I want to know all of you. I like being among people you love and they truly know you. I like existing… in your world.”</p><p align="left">Rio lifted Agatha’s hand and held it briefly in her warm hold. “You're my world, Agatha.” Then she lifted it up, close to her lips, brushing Agatha’s soft fingers on her own lips. Then she kissed the back of it. Tenderly. Lovingly. More than once.</p><p align="left">They arrived at Rio’s place and they stepped inside after Agatha parked the car.</p><p align="left">Once they were inside, Rio went straight to the kitchen. Then Agatha followed her after a minute. Rio was drinking the bottle of water and nearly choked after seeing Agatha in her white shirt without the blazer—as if she wasn't the one who kissed Agatha's shoulders, smearing her skin with her red lipstick, then she put the blazer on Agatha’s shoulder before they got out a couple of hours ago. </p><p align="left">“Easy with that,” Agatha said with a smirk as she approached Rio who was standing near the fridge, half of her body leaned on the counter. She took the bottle from Rio’s hold and started drinking the rest of it while guiding Rio’s hand to rest on her hip. Then she lifted her own hand and teasingly started running her fingers on Rio’s wet lips. With light brushes.</p><p align="left">Rio was dumbstruck, swallowing down really hard. Feeling Agatha’s fingers brushing on her lips while seeing her exposed throat popping as she gulped the water down. And suddenly, Rio became aware of how her whole body was connected. How everything seemed to directly affect her cunt. Every little goddamn thing.</p><p align="left">Agatha moved the empty bottle away from her mouth and turned around to throw it in the trash can, then she looked back at Rio as she placed her hand on the back of her neck.</p><p align="left">“I had fun tonight.” Agatha admitted as she started brushing the small hairs on the back of Rio’s neck. Her other hand slid under Rio’s jacket, holding her hip tightly.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't say anything. She just kept looking up at Agatha’s face—now Rio was back to being slightly taller than her after she took her heels off. </p><p align="left">“<em>And you know what?</em>” Agatha wondered, moving both of her thumbs on different spots of Rio’s body. Both of them making shivers run down her spine.</p><p align="left">“<em>Hmm</em>?” Rio weakly hummed in question. Feeling herself getting dizzy from looking at Agatha. Because fuck, she really looked dazing.</p><p align="left">“I think… I deserve sucking your dick more than that priest.” Agatha smirked.</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh, fuck.</em>” Rio heavily moaned out the words.</p><p align="left">“What do you think?” Agatha asked, drawing patterns on Rio’s pulse point with her thumb. Weakening her completely. Making her knees shake in their place.</p><p align="left">“Yes. Of course. Yes.” The words stumbled on their way out of Rio's mouth. Causing Agatha to smirk even wider.</p><p align="left">“<em>Hmm</em>? I'll let you take me. How does that sound, my love?”</p><p align="left">“Like winning the fucking lottery.”</p><p align="left">Agatha let out a breathy chuckle as she leaned her face in and inhaled Rio’s neck deeply. Then she pressed a teasing kiss to Rio’s lips as her hand drifted lower from her hip, down to grab her butt.</p><p align="left">She pulled back, her pupils were dark and blown widely.</p><p align="left">“Then go get ready for me. I want you to fuck me real good. Hmm? Can you do that for me?”</p><p align="left">“<em>Yes, I can.</em>”</p><p align="left">“<em>Good boy.</em>” Agatha praised as she leaned in to slightly bite Rio’s bottom lip, taking it between her teeth. Then she let go, making Rio a whimpering mess.</p><p align="left">Agatha landed a slap on her butt cheek, then immediately squeezed the flesh tightly with her whole hand.</p><p align="left">“Go up stairs. I'll follow you in a minute.” She kissed Rio again.</p><p align="left">And Rio was technically running up the stairs as she took off her blazer on the way up. Hearing Agatha’s arousing chuckles behind her. </p><p align="left"><em>Good lord.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe and to love you</em></p><hr/><p align="left">Rio unlocked the door to her house. Once she heard the click, she turned her head back to look at Agatha with a grin—a knowing one. She knew that, once this door was pushed open and they stepped into the house; the public would dissolve and she'd finally be in the <em>lioness' den</em> after she encroached her territory.</p><p align="left">Agatha was smirking, her face resting in great delight. Standing with a straight spine, two steps behind Rio with her hands buried in her pockets. The look in her eyes was unreadable, looking at Rio with a combination of desire, hunger, <em>and</em> a challenge. She looked like she knew what she wanted, and Agatha always did.</p><p align="left">Once Rio pushed the door open and she stepped inside, Agatha followed behind with grace. Calculated steps and clicking heels.</p><p align="left">She kicked the door shut with her foot, grabbed Rio’s wrist, and immediately pinned her against the wall. Causing Rio’s back to hit it with a loud thud in the middle of the stillness of the house.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">Rio grinned as she noticed Agatha’s dilated pupils. Agatha was smirking, looking at Rio’s face like it personally has insulted her—if anything, Rio’s face <em>offered</em> her a lot. She sat on it so many times to be counted and had the best time on her throne.</p><p align="left">Agatha's breaths were even, landing warmly on Rio’s face as she tightened her hold on Rio’s wrist.</p><p align="left">They stood like that for a few long seconds. Looking at each other’s faces, listening and feeling each other’s breaths. They didn't talk, and the silence between them was enwinding. They didn't need to utter a single word at that moment—everything was being said through stares and lips twitches.</p><p align="left">“So…” Rio spoke with a low tone. </p><p align="left">“So, Rio…” Agatha chimed in as the side of her lips curled up. “Tell me my love…” She leaned in and inhaled Rio’s neck deeply, filling her lungs with her scent, then she stood straight again to meet her eyes. “Did you have fun playing with me all night?” Agatha said with a low tone that could be heard only in the space between them, in their proximity. And it made Rio’s heart drop down to her stomach.</p><p align="left">Their eyes were locked. Their irises swirling, and their reflections were visible in each other’s eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio’s breaths were already heavy, her chest was rapidly rising and falling as she took Agatha’s scent inside her body with every inhale.</p><p>Rio smiled. “<em>So</em> much fun.” She replied, poking the inside of her cheek with the tip of her tongue. She tried to sound casual, not affected by the way Agatha was looking at her, yet, everything in her being was showing how <em>too</em> far gone she was. Screaming what she wanted and desperately needed.</p><p align="left">Rio was already aroused by all the promises. All the <em>cordial</em> threats Agatha edged her with all night. Repeating that she was <em>in deep trouble</em>—yet, Rio knew that <em>deep trouble</em> actually equaled having the time of her life with Agatha. A threat of deep trouble shouldn't make Rio squirm in her place with titillation, but with Agatha? She did. And that was why she'd been acting like a brat all night. She had her reasons—had her ticket for the ride, might as well enjoy it.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her hands up, about to place them on Agatha’s hips, but Agatha grabbed both of her wrists firmly with a raised eyebrow. She lifted Rio’s arms up by the wrists and pinned them above her head.</p><p align="left">With that position, Agatha’s body leaned closer to Rio’s, their bodies almost flush against each other. They could feel the heat of their skins even under the layers of fabric.</p><p align="left">Agatha cocked an eyebrow as she licked her lips and stared straight into Rio’s brown, wide eyes that were gleaming and dark with anticipation. </p><p align="left">“No, you don't get to touch me. I told you brats get punished, didn't I?” Agatha’s voice dropped even lower, and <em>god</em> it made Rio’s head spin. Making her heart race in her chest. Lost in her chords.</p><p align="left">But Rio couldn't give up just yet. She met Agatha’s gaze and mirrored her facial expressions. She knew how to have her fun.</p><p align="left">Agatha mouthed a silent <em>Oh?</em> As she looked at Rio with amusement written all over her face.</p><p align="left">“I don't think you can punish me, baby.” Rio smiled as she tried sliding her leg between Agatha’s, but Agatha was faster than her. She leaned in, and flushed their hips against each other. Caging Rio and stopping her from doing anything.</p><p align="left">Rio was able to sharply feel Agatha’s hipbones against hers, and she fought herself not to moan at how close they were. How delicious it always felt to be this close to Agatha, to see her acting like that.</p><p align="left">“You'd be surprised by how much I'm capable of, sweetheart.” Agatha sharply exhaled through her nose. The warm air landing on Rio’s face. “Do you think you can handle me not touching you all night? Hmm?”</p><p align="left">Rio’s breath hitched. She saw that one coming, and she <em>knew</em> Agatha was more than capable of doing that—her lover’s self-control surprised her so many times to be counted. And Agatha did it all for the sake of denying or edging Rio.</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed. “You—you can't do that. You can't resist me.” </p><p align="left">Agatha laughed. Her voice was dripping with delight. The sound was so wicked. So mean and intentional. And it was so goddamn arousing.</p><p align="left">“Oh, my poor baby. Let's see about that, shall we?” She said and released Rio’s wrists the same second she took a step backward. Her eyes lingered on Rio’s face for a second then she turned around.</p><p align="left">Agatha flickered her hair over her shoulder, smirking in smugness. “Now get me those tapes and show me your surprise, my love.” she said as she walked toward the couch in the living room. Swaying her hips intentionally—making Rio's mouth water and her entire body to be paralyzed with her back still resting against the wall. Not quite able to fathom just yet.</p><p align="left">Rio knew she had it coming.</p><p align="left">They were on a movie date, watching <em>Chicago</em> 2002 in the theaters because Rio had said that the movie was one of the many ways she confirmed her sexuality to herself after having doubts in her early teenage years, saying that everyone got infected by society’s rules and norms at some point even if she knew she was a raging homosexual from a young age.</p><p align="left">“<em>When I saw Catherine Zeta-Jones performing And All That Jazz, I knew I was a lesbian without a doubt.</em>” She had said as they walked into the cinema hall.</p><p align="left">They were sitting in the back rows. The theater was almost empty except for a few heads that could be seen from behind, everyone was enjoying their time.</p><p align="left">During the <em>Cell Block Tango</em> scene, Agatha was resting on her seat—completely focused on the screen, and Rio was watching <em>her</em> instead of the movie. </p><p align="left">Agatha’s face and eyes were flashing from the screen, Rio grinned and slowly leaned in to whisper into her ear. </p><p align="left">“You know I got the tapes from Alice yesterday.” And she didn't pull back. She decided to linger in that space. With her face too close to Agatha, she could take her scent in with every inhale.</p><p align="left">Agatha turned to the side and looked at her.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked as their smiles reflected.</p><p align="left">“Yeah?” Agatha whispered, one side of her mouth curled up in a mischievous, anticipated smirk.</p><p align="left">Her eyes were gleaming, the side of her face was illuminated by the constantly changing colors coming from the big screen.</p><p align="left">“Mhm.” Rio hummed as she chewed on a popcorn. “And guess what…”</p><p align="left">“What?” Agatha licked her lips. Utterly absorbed by what Rio was talking about—she was the one who asked Rio to get them in the first place.</p><p align="left">Rio smirked as she put her clean hand on Agatha’s thigh and started teasingly brushing her thigh above the fabric of her pants. Going up and down.</p><p align="left">They were looking at each other, lost in each other.</p><p align="left">Rio bit down on her bottom lip and slid her hand in the small gap between Agatha’s thighs.</p><p align="left">“<em>Rio</em>…” Agatha whispered her name. She meant it as a warning but it got out from her throat like a helpless, neddy whimper and it made Rio melt in her seat.</p><p align="left">Rio was glad no one was sitting behind them. She lifted her eyes up and looked at the security camera in the corner then she looked back at Agatha with a grin.</p><p align="left">“I have a surprise for you.”</p><p align="left">“What is it?”</p><p align="left">“Well, it's not a surprise if I tell you…” Rio chuckled the moment Agatha slightly parted her thighs, urging Rio to get <em>in</em> despite the hesitant look in her eyes.</p><p align="left">So Rio obliged and started brushing the inside of her thigh with intention—to make Agatha squirm in her place.</p><p align="left">“When we get home, I'll show you.”</p><p align="left">“Then let's go home.” Agatha immediately said without thinking about it for too long. As if she couldn't waste a single second.</p><p align="left">Her eyes were dark and wide. It was obvious how much she was affected by the situation—and it delighted Rio—noticing how her chest started heaving with Rio’s unvarying brushing. Agatha was constantly licking her lips or moving the tip of her tongue against the inside of her cheek—which was a habit she picked up from Rio. She'd been doing it long before knowing Rio, but not that often. Since they got together, Agatha had been doing it more. And every time she did, the gesture made Rio’s heart tighten in her chest. Because the thought of them sharing habits, and gestures, and routines made her melt. It lovingly weakened her.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at Agatha. Half of her face was red from the scene playing on the screen.</p><p align="left">“Well, we can't do that. This movie is a masterpiece.” Rio said with a smirk as she turned her head to look at the screen. She was about to pull her hand away from between Agatha’s thighs, but Agatha immediately trapped her hand there by squeezing her thighs to close the gap.</p><p align="left">And as the night escalated, Rio kept commenting every now and then. Whispering sweet nothings into Agatha’s ear or saying the dirtiest things she'd ever said.</p><p align="left">“Do you think I can get down on my knees and eat you out without someone noticing us?” Rio said, her eyes were glued to the screen but her lips were curled up in a heinous smirk.</p><p align="left">Agatha was the one to lean in at that moment. <em>Too close</em>, her nose was digging in Rio’s cheekbone as she sharply exhaled a warm breath on her skin. Rio didn't dare looking at her—if she wanted to keep the act without losing, then she didn't want to see how feral Agatha was. Because Rio knew she'd get down on her knees in front of Agatha the moment their eyes met. </p><p align="left">“Keep doing that, my love. You'll regret it once we get back.”</p><p align="left">“I didn't say anything.”</p><p align="left">“Look at me.” Agatha whispered. Her breath was hot against Rio’s skin.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't.</p><p align="left">Her eyes moved left and right, trying to catch what was going on in the movie, but she didn't seem like she had a goddamn clue, even if she had watched it so many times. Rio was way too lost to comprehend. </p><p align="left">“<em>I said look at me.</em>”</p><p align="left">“I'm watching, baby.” Rio grinned like an idiot. Her face was illuminated blue.</p><p align="left">“<em>Rio.</em>” Agatha called her name in <em>that</em> tone that made Rio uncontrollably drip down. A tone that made her lose all of her self-control and throw it outside the window.</p><p align="left">She involuntarily moaned as she felt Agatha slightly pulling her head back. A moan that was low and desperate.</p><p align="left">Then Agatha placed her hands on Rio’s hips under her jacket and turned Rio’s body around so they could face each other.</p><p align="left">“Yes, my love.” Rio breathlessly said once their eyes met. Still trying to keep the act of pretending that she wasn't being unraveled on her seat.</p><p align="left">Once she saw the way Agatha was looking at her, Rio's pulse started pounding between her thighs, she swallowed hard. “Are you going to punish me once we get back?” Rio whispered as she leaned closer. And <em>god</em>, how arousing everything was.</p><p align="left">“Tell me, Rio. Do you want to get punished?”</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed again. “It… it depends. What are you gonna do? What's the punishment gonna be?”</p><p align="left">Agatha tightened her hold on Rio’s hips and Rio whined at the delicious pressure—only if she could have it <em>somewhere else.</em></p><p align="left">“You're in so much trouble and you don't even know it.” Agatha removed her hands and sat down on her seat.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck</em>, can we go home now?” Rio asked as she leaned even closer and took a strand of Agatha’s dark hair to roll on it around her finger. </p><p align="left">“Sorry, baby. I want to finish the movie.” Agatha said with a smile as she folded her arms on her chest without even looking at Rio.</p><p align="left">Rio only pouted and kept looking at Agatha’s side profile. And <em>god</em>—how her nose looked like <em>the</em> perfect seat from that angle. It actually looked like that from every goddamn angle.</p><p align="left">As they kept watching—or pretending to do so—Rio was looking at Agatha every few seconds. She could feel Agatha looking at her, but every time Rio turned around, Agatha wasn't looking. She couldn't catch her mid-act, and she desperately wanted to.</p><p align="left">Then without a warning, Agatha slid her hand between Rio’s thighs. She started moving her thumb up and down on Rio’s clothed cunt.</p><p align="left">Rio moaned heavily as she felt Agatha’s thumb ring right on her cunt from over the fabric. The moan was a little too loud to where they were, but it blended with the breathy way of how <em>Roxie Hart</em> had said <em>Oh, I'm a star.</em></p><p align="left">“Shhh.” Agatha shushed with a wicked smirk as she leaned closer to Rio’s ear. “Do you know I can feel how fucking wet you are from here? Even above your tight, sexy, leather pants?”</p><p align="left">Rio instinctively parted her thighs and Agatha chuckled right into her ear, causing Rio to close her eyes shut. It was way too much and not enough. Not enough at all.</p><p align="left">“Oh baby, you're so <em>dirty</em>. You want to be fucked in public? You want me to touch you, hmm, Rio? Want my fingers <em>in</em> your needy cunt? You want to get off on my hand while we pretend we're watching?” Agatha whispered and it only worsened the situation on Rio and made her drip down pathetically.</p><p align="left">“Now you don't want to talk, right? Isn't that <em>adorable</em>?” Agatha’s voice dropped lower with intention. It was more wicked. Promising. Lust-dripping—and <em>O Almighty god, </em>how it fucked Rio’s head prodigiously. How it made her desperately quiver in her seat.</p><p align="left">Rio met Agatha's eyes. And in that moment she realized she was indeed in <em>deep trouble</em>—so she had nothing to lose and <em>everything</em> to gain.</p><p align="left">“Do <em>you</em> want that?” Rio put her hand on the back of Agatha’s hair and weakly fisted it to lift Agatha’s head up so they would be staring into each other's dark eyes. “Do you want me to…” Rio didn't finish her sentence, she leaned her face in and grabbed Agatha’s bottom lip between her teeth. Digging them in the soft flesh for a second, then she let go of it.</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't say anything, she only looked at Rio with a smirk that explicitly meant: <em>baby, you fucked up</em>.</p><p align="left">After a couple of minutes had passed, Agatha stood up then offered her hand for Rio to hold.</p><p align="left">Rio looked up at her with a raised brow and dark, gleaming eyes, then she put her hand in Agatha’s and rose to her feet.</p><p align="left">Once Rio’s hand was in hers, Agatha tightened her hold and pulled Rio closer to her side to whisper right into her ear—Rio could feel Agatha’s wet lips against her skin.</p><p align="left">“You look <em>so</em> innocent for someone who’s been acting like a needy, bratty slut all night.” Agatha said then she bit her bottom lip and dragged Rio to get out of the cinema hall without giving her a chance to respond. And it wasn't like Rio actually had a response other than to moan and for her cunt to clench around nothing. Her body had its reactions and a verbal response definitely wasn't one of them at that moment.</p><p align="left">And that was how Rio found herself looking at Agatha sitting on the couch with her legs crossed, waiting for Rio to come to her.</p><p align="left">As Rio took a step forward, Agatha looked at her with a wide smirk. She beckoned with two fingers for Rio to come as she lay down. Her head was resting on the armrest, and Rio—as if she was being pulled forward against her will—started obediently walking until she reached the couch.</p><p align="left">Agatha put her arm behind her head and reached out for Rio with the other one, <em>that</em> smirk never left her face.</p><p align="left">Agatha took Rio’s hand and lifted it up to her lips. She tenderly kissed the back of it as their eyes locked. </p><p align="left">“So, baby. What's the plan for tonight?”</p><p align="left">“I'll… I will go get the tapes and the—the…”</p><p align="left">“Mhm, the surprise? I'm excited for that one.” Agatha kissed her hand again and Rio melted like an ice cube. Spilling all over the surface.</p><p align="left">“Come here, baby. Give me a kiss.” Agatha said with a sultry voice and Rio’s heart pounded—she knew what <em>that</em> tone meant.</p><p align="left">In the past few months, Rio learned almost every tone of voice Agatha used with her, and each one of them affected Rio differently, but fully.</p><p align="left">She knew she was deeply in love with Agatha and her voice. It made her heart pound in her chest every time the love of her life talked. No matter what she said, the moment Agatha would start talking, Rio would get lost in her chords and tones. And she always wondered how good Agatha would sound if she sang. She heard her humming so many times, joyful and some sorrowful hums, but never singing.</p><p align="left">Rio leaned down to kiss her but Agatha seemed like she had a different plan. Agatha grabbed Rio's wrist and pulled her forward until she fell on top of her.</p><p align="left">Rio wasn't even able to adjust to the lying position she found herself in and Agatha’s mouth crashed onto hers as she put both of her hands on Rio’s back. Rio’s leg was between Agatha’s thighs—one of Agatha's legs was bent up, so Rio’s knee was right <em>on</em> her cunt.</p><p align="left">Agatha slightly pulled her head back after pressing a peck to Rio’s lips. Rio was panting, even though the kiss wasn't that deep, but the way Agatha had pulled her. The way she was feeling Agatha’s heat-radiating cunt through the layers of fabric. And the way Agatha was looking at her—all of it made Rio unable to steady her breathing or fathom anything.</p><p align="left">And what added to all of that—the red, bing cherry on top—was when Agatha slightly jerked her hips up so she could grind her cunt against Rio’s knee, all while keeping eye contact and smirking like someone who guaranteed their victory, knowing that the goddamn prize was theirs. </p><p align="left">“Baby, you're shaking.” Agatha chuckled as she slid her hands and placed them on Rio’s waist. Then she started getting her body up while lifting Rio's with her, until both of them were sitting. “Hmm.” Agatha hummed with a pout. And Rio? <em>God</em>, Rio was about to combust right there and then. </p><p align="left">“So… are you planning on getting up or would you like to stay here and stare at me…” Agatha leaned closer and grazed Rio’s ear with her teeth. A shiver ran down Rio’s spine and her body trembled. “Desperate for me…”</p><p align="left">“Look, baby.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Shhh</em>, I don't want you to talk right now, my love. Can you do that for me?” </p><p align="left">Rio whimpered.</p><p align="left">“But keep those beautiful sounds coming out. I want you to show me how desperate you are through your <em>delicious</em> whines and moans.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck</em>—”</p><p align="left">“Well, cursing... That's allowed too.” </p><p align="left">Agatha slightly pulled back and looked straight into Rio’s eyes. “Tell me if it's too much, yeah? If you want me to stop, tell me.” Agatha’s voice immediately changed. From hot and soul-wrecking to soft and <em>also</em> soul-wrecking. Because yeah, Rio was down on her knees for that woman.</p><p align="left">She could wreck her. Tell her to shut the fuck up and she'd thank her for it after she'd earn the right to talk back again </p><p align="left">“No—” Rio swallowed so hard, the sound was loud and audible between them.</p><p align="left">“I…” She didn't know how to voice how much she wanted Agatha to be mean to her in that way—and not exactly mean, it was more like… wickedly luscious. It fucked with Rio’s mind and body and made her head whirl with desire—her desire for Agatha.</p><p align="left">So instead of saying what this side of Agatha was doing to her—and always did to her—Rio was the one to lean in and whisper: “It's my punishment.” then she slightly pulled back as she noticed the way Agatha's eyes darkened and her lips curled up in <em>that</em> smirk again. Rio knew she had, willingly, signed for her own torture, and possibly her death.</p><p align="left">“Fuck… you look so goddamn hot when you're smart like that.”</p><p align="left">“And you drive me insane when you're being like… <em>this</em>.” </p><p align="left">Rio saw the way her confession affected Agatha. In the way her pupils dilated even wider. How her hand stilled from brushing Rio’s thigh, and how she  smile widely.</p><p align="left">Agatha cupped Rio’s face—almost in a hurry—and crashed their mouths again. This time deeper. With more fervor and desire. Rio could taste it. Feel it. Swallow down what Agatha was pouring into her mouth with delight.</p><p align="left">Their tongues tangled as Agatha slightly tilted her head to the side to be able to devour Rio’s mouth the right way.</p><p align="left">Rio’s body was flaring-up. Heat increasing, fire ignting—wild and untamed.</p><p align="left">She could feel herself drip down as her stomach burned from intensity. And for some reason, the way she was feeling the cold silver of Agatha’s thumb ring on her skin—<em>that ring</em>—it made Rio moan heavily into Agatha’s mouth.</p><p align="left">As the kiss escalated, Rio found herself being pushed down while her mouth was being devoured out, until the back of her head was resting against the armrest of the couch and Agatha was suddenly on top of her.</p><p align="left">Rio pulled back and their dark, wide eyes locked. </p><p align="left">Nothing but desire could be seen in their gaze. Both of them reflected how much they were affected. They could see it in each other’s eyes. Their breaths were hot and heavy on each other’s faces, desperately trying, and utterly failing to steady their breaths. </p><p align="left">As one of Agatha’s hands started brushing Rio’s thigh again, Rio couldn't help but breathlessly smile in delight.</p><p align="left">“Well, well… someone said they won't be touching me all night, and now they can't keep their hands to themselves…”</p><p align="left">Agatha raised an eyebrow. “I also told you to keep quiet, didn't I?”</p><p align="left">“Yes.”</p><p align="left">“Then shut up and go change your clothes.” Agatha's eyes drifted between eyes and slightly parted lips. “I know the button of those pants is digging a ggoddamnhole into your stomach.” she said with a low voice as she lifted her hand from Rio’s thigh, up to rest on the button of her tight leather jeans. “You had to wear those tonight, didn't you? You know they make your ass look <em>delicious</em>.” Agatha popped the button open and Rio was so <em>relieved</em> as she was finally able to feel her stomach again.</p><p align="left">Agatha rested her hand on Rio’s skin under her shirt and started to rub her thumb over a red button-mark just below Rio’s navel. “One day... I'll tear them with my fucking teeth, Rio.”</p><p align="left">“Why not now?” Rio breathlessly asked.</p><p align="left">“You'll know why when the day comes. Now get up.” Agatha pulled back to give Rio the space to stand up.</p><p align="left">And Rio did, once she was on her feet, a slap landed on her buttcheek—the sound of Agatha’s hand on the leather of her pants was so loud and it made Rio’s heart clench in her chest more than the slap itself.</p><p align="left">“And you don't want to? To change?” Rio said as Agatha stood up behind her.</p><p align="left">“I do.” Agatha grabbed both of Rio’s asscheeks with her hands. Firmly squeezing them as she buried her face in Rio’s neck. Inhaling her skin deeply.</p><p align="left">“I wore something special for you underneath those, baby.” Agatha said before she started deeply kissing Rio’s neck. “<em>Do you</em>…” a kiss. “<em>Want</em>…” she sucked on Rio’s pulse point as she lifted her hands up and placed them on Rio’s hip bones causing Rio's knees to buckle. Almost unable to hold her own weight. “<em>A hint</em>?” Agatha said the last word right into Rio’s ear, causing every hair in her body to stand on its end. </p><p align="left">Rio eagerly nodded, almost breaking her neck because of how frantically she moved her head up and down—but Agatha bit on the soft flesh of her earlobe the same second, causing Rio’s body to quiver. Feeling Agatha’s teeth biting down was grounding and arousing.</p><p align="left">“Maybe later.” Agatha licked the back of her ear and Rio moaned. Unable to suppress her sounds any longer, it was already too much. “But only if you can behave.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, I can do that.” Rio whimpered then another slap landed on her buttcheek—it was Agatha’s way of telling her to go.</p><p align="left">And Rio did, she walked away in hurried steps. Going up the stairs as if someone was chasing her.</p><p align="left">She got inside the bedroom and immediately started taking her clothes off. Carelessly throwing them on the chair, garment after garment.</p><p align="left">As she was done with her leather jeans and ruined underwear, Rio realized how much the night had affected her. She felt herself dripping every time Agatha said <em>or</em> did something, but she didn't know it was <em>that</em> bad—or <em>that fucking good</em>?</p><p align="left">She put on a white crop top and black boxers. Rio looked at herself in the mirror for a few seconds, looking at the mark that had blossomed on the side of her neck from the way Agatha had sucked on the skin a few minutes ago. She traced it with her fingers.</p><p align="left">She couldn't believe it.</p><p align="left">How could she?</p><p align="left">Yes, it happened so many times to be counted. Agatha adoringly marked her skin and graced her body almost every night. But she still couldn't believe it.</p><p align="left">To be marked, lovingly. To be touched, devotedly.</p><p align="left">Rio got out of the bedroom and approached the indoor garden where she was keeping the tapes in a box after she sorted them out yesterday.</p><p align="left">When Rio came back from work, she spent the rest of her day going through her past life junk. </p><p align="left">It was a collection of many tapes that she didn't care to count. Each one had a label on it, and she was so <em>mortified</em> because of the titles they had picked for the videotapes when they were <em>way</em> younger. Other titles made her laugh her guts out. And there were a few that made her eyes glassy, causing a few tears to fall down—because nostalgia was a goddamn beast.</p><p align="left">Rio only watched three of them—the ones she knew she wasn't the main focus of, because she couldn't look at her past-self for a time longer than three videos.</p><p align="left">She couldn't see that version of her. To re-live the memories. She didn't want to dig the holes and carry the bones of what she had buried a long time ago.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted the box up and made sure the newest tape wasn't on top—the one that had been gnawing at her since yesterday, but she dismissed the regret of doing such a thing every time the feeling crept inside her body. Because it was done, and she wwouldn'thave to deal with it, it was for Agatha to handle.</p><p align="left">Rio went downstairs where she saw Agatha drinking a red bull, which caused Rio to smile, because the times of which Agatha had scolded her and told her how energy drinks were bad for her were uncountable. And Agatha usually said that with a goddamn cigarette resting between her fingers.</p><p align="left">But Rio knew the reason why Agatha was drinking that red bull in the first place—it was all for her. For Rio.</p><p align="left">Agatha wasn't drinking that much alcoholic drinks since Rio quit, and she made sure not to drink in front of Rio. Not that Rio couldn't control herself—she actually couldn't—but Agatha just didn't want to burden Rio more. Agatha had told her one night, after Rio had brought it up and the conversation led to that topic somehow—Agatha was softly brushing her hair as she told her how quitting was a hard thing to do, and she knew it mostly depended on the individual's effort, but it also depended on who surrounded them. It was a huge part of the journey. Because if someone couldn't leave their glass of whiskey when they knew someone else was struggling, that was downright selfish.</p><p align="left">And as the days kept passing on, Agatha made sure to always fix Rio some drinks. Which Rio told her every time that they were the best mocktails she'd ever drank and that Agatha would be <em>a hella good bartender</em>.</p><p align="left">Whether it was a non-alcoholic mojito, a Strawberry Daiquiri, Shirley Temple, Agatha’s <em>great</em> collection of herbal teas, or even the bottle of non-alcoholic red wine that she brought one day and mixed it with sparkling water.</p><p align="left">Because Rio knew Agatha was <em>that</em> woman, and she was doing it all for her.</p><p align="left">Rio jumped down the last tread of the stairs. Walking with a smile on her face as she put the box full-of-tapes on the kitchen island beside the glasses Agatha had taken out and a bowl of frozen grapes and watermelon.</p><p align="left">She looked at Agatha’s back—who was looking at the fridge freezer while sipping her red bull and humming a soft tone. Then she turned around and Rio’s breath ggot caught in her throat at the sight.</p><p align="left">She noticed that Agatha had taken off her blazer but she also had opened the three top buttons of her shirt—<em>WHY</em> <em>THREE?!</em> Rio’s brain screamed at her as she opened her mouth in an attempt to say something, with her eyes fixed on Agatha’s cleavage—but nothing got out of her throat. Not when she was able to see <em>a hint</em> of what Agatha was wearing underneath.</p><p align="left">Agatha clicked her fingers to bring Rio's attention to her.“Eyes up here, handsome.” </p><p align="left">Rio lifted her eyes up and their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">Rio was basically drooling and Agatha’s smirk widened in delight.</p><p align="left">“You're—you're drinking one of those <em>unhealthy, extremely bad for my insides</em> energy drinks.” Rio stammered. She was dumbstruck by what she was seeing.</p><p align="left">Was that a navy-blue bodysuit Agatha was wearing underneath? Or two separate pieces of lingerie? What could Rio <em>possibly</em> do to get Agatha to show her? What must she do so she would be rewarded with undressing Agatha? She was ready to do <em>absolutely</em> anything.</p><p align="left">Rio’s brain didn't calm down for a moment. Her body was heating up with every passing second. She couldn't even hear what Agatha said because the only thing she was hearing was her rapid heartbeat ringing in her ears and blending with the voices in her head.</p><p align="left">“Well, it's good... in a way. I still don't get the hype.”</p><p align="left">“Yes, right. I—can I?... Let me see what you're wearing.” Rio said as her eyes kept drifting across Agatha's body. Up and down, until her eyes were up again and were staring at Agatha's wide, hypnotizing pair of blue eyes.</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled. “<em>Oh</em>, you're drooling, my love.” Agatha took a sip from the can she was holding as she took a step forward, closing the space between them. She lifted her hand up and started gently moving her thumb. Left and right on Rio’s bottom lip, causing Rio to slightly part her lips and exhale warmly on the delicate fingertip. “<em>Later</em>.” </p><p align="left">Agatha took a step to the side, set her drink down and started looking at the tapes in the box.</p><p align="left">She lifted one up and stared at it for a few seconds.</p><p align="left">“<em>2008, Rio’s last performance.</em>” Agatha read it out loud with a soft smile as she continued observing the tape as if she could find something on it. “How old were you in 2008? Twenty-four?”</p><p align="left">Rio nodded in affirmation.</p><p align="left">“Hmm. You told me you stopped playing in college.”</p><p align="left">“Yes, um—” Rio scratched the back of her neck with her short nails as she walked to stand on the other side of the kitchen island. “This was an exception. It was just me and Alice not the band. We—we had a gig right after we got our master degrees. We just... felt like we wanted to celebrate in <em>that</em> way, you know? Because it was awful.” Rio chuckled. “Well, anyway, it was something small in a bar where everybody kinda hated us. We—uh, <em>god</em>, we played one of our songs. It's called <em>Juicy Enough, </em>so no wonder they hated us.” Rio chuckled as she started looking at the tapes in the box. Not really looking at them, her mind was elsewhere. Floating in nostalgia.</p><p align="left">Agatha hummed.</p><p align="left">“You were with Alice at the time?” Agatha asked as she resumed looking. Her lips were constantly moving with no sounds coming out as she read a few titles of some tapes in her head.</p><p align="left">“No, we had broken up for the second time a year before that.” Rio walked toward the fridge and took out a can of red bull.</p><p align="left">“<em>Rio talks about how important John Water’s films  are while sniffing glue.</em>” Agatha laughed as she turned around to look at Rio. “Seriously?” She asked while holding the tape up for Rio to see. The laugh was still visible in her voice and features.</p><p align="left">“We—” Rio said as she cracked the can open and blinked instinctively once the <em>snap</em> sound reached her ears. She took a sip as her eyes locked on Agatha's.</p><p align="left">“We were minors and stupid, Agatha. We didn't do drugs—we sniffed chemicals. Easy access to damage ourselves.” Rio jumped up to sit on the kitchen island and she swallowed hard once she realized <em>how much</em> she could see of Agatha’s cleavage from that angle.</p><p align="left">“If you were minors then how the hell did you watch John Water’s movies?”</p><p align="left">Rio grinned. “Well, we didn't have that <em>great</em> sense of morality back then. We were just living—each one of us drags the other. Everything was grey in a way, so we had no problem with, you know, stealing or even putting our pirate eye patches on.”</p><p align="left">“Jesus.” Agatha laughed. “<em>Häng Gud.</em> Is this…”</p><p align="left">“Swedish. A song by Ebba Grön.” </p><p align="left">“This is not your handwriting, right?”</p><p align="left">“No, it's mostly Alice’s. She did the sorting. She loves doing those things. I bet she watched every videotape at least a hundred times.”</p><p align="left">Agatha hummed again as she continued looking into the box. A few long seconds passed, Agatha raised an eyebrow as she picked <em>that</em> tape. Rio immediately snatched it from her hold causing her drink to spill down on her boxers.</p><p align="left">“Nope, not this one.” Rio said as she tightened her hold on the object and hid it behind her back.</p><p align="left">“This one is <em>your</em> handwriting.” Agatha smirked. “Your porn star? Is that what's written?” She licked her lips as her eyes gleamed.</p><p align="left">“Nope.” Rio jumped down the counter. She was about to walk away, but Agatha was quick to cage her. </p><p align="left">“Where are you going? Give it to me.”</p><p align="left">“I changed my mind.”</p><p align="left">“Oh?” Agatha licked her lips as she searched Rio's eyes with her wide ones. “<em>Oh! </em>It's the surprise, isn't it?”</p><p align="left">“No, wrong tape. I don't know how it had gotten here. Totally wrong tape—not even mine.”</p><p align="left">“You're such a bad liar, do you know that?” Agatha’s smirk darkened as she leaned closer. Their hips were flush against each other.</p><p align="left">Rio softly moaned—barely audible—the moment her eyes drifted down and landed on Agatha’s breasts. The way the fourth button was about to <em>pop out</em> because of how Agatha was leaning forward put Rio on the verge of sanity. She was going fucking insane.</p><p align="left">“<em>Choke me, already.</em>” Rio murmured—she meant it to stay in her head but at that moment she had <em>zero</em> self-control. She didn't even fathom what the hell was going on, she just knew she was about to faint. And she knew she wanted to faint while her head would be buried <em>deep</em> in Agatha's breasts.</p><p align="left">“I will, if you ask nicely.” Agatha lifted her hand up and opened the fourth button—Rio blinked, her eyes frantically drifted between Agatha’s eyes and how her fingers were moving on the fabric.</p><p align="left">The fifth button—Rio blinked again as she harshly bit down on her bottom lip. She could taste the metallic taste of her blood. The Sixth—her mouth watered, and she licked her lips. Rio was able to see what it was. What <em>holiness</em> was lying underneath—a bodysuit that made her head whirl as everything started spinning around her.</p><p align="left">Rio's hand twitched by her side and her breaths were heavy. She was only able to see until Agatha’s waist—because the rest of the bodysuit disappeared under her pants and blocked Rio’s eyes. Denied her the blessing of seeing it all.</p><p align="left">She felt Agatha’s other hand touching the exposed skin of her hip, then she started brushing her way behind Rio’s back. And Rio was <em>too lost</em> in the sensations to realize what was happening.</p><p align="left">“<em>Distracted</em>?” Agatha asked with a low, sultry tone and it made Rio’s body tremble noticeably.</p><p align="left">And the last button <em>clicked</em> and was undone—Agatha’s shirt reamined only hanging on her shoulders.</p><p align="left">Agatha took a step backward as she lifted the tape up to look at it with a smirk—she took it when Rio was <em>too</em> distracted to even think. When she was drowning in the ocean of her arousal.</p><p align="left">Rio blinked several times until she realized and lifted her empty hand to look at it. “<em>Fuck</em>.” She cursed with a heavy sigh.</p><p align="left"><strong>Your Porn Star, A.</strong></p><p align="left">Agatha kept observing the object. Running her fingers tenderly over it—and even during that, Rio was so fucking distracted by Agatha. She kept imagining what the rest of the bodysuit looked like. How good Agatha would look if she put her glasses on. <em>Oh, Lord.</em></p><p align="left">“Is this new?” </p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed. Feeling her heart banging in her chest, about to break her ribcage and release itself. To put an end to the <em>salacious</em> misery.</p><p align="left">Agatha raised an eyebrow in delight. Waiting for a response with an anticipated smirk.</p><p align="left">“Yes.”</p><p align="left">“How new?”</p><p align="left">“Y-yesterday. I recorded it last night with my old camera. And… well… to, you know… it's for you. I recorded it for you.”</p><p align="left">Agatha turned the tape around to look at the back of it then she lifted her eyes up to look at Rio.</p><p align="left">“Shall we start with this one?”</p><p align="left">“Look, baby. It's stupid… I don't even know why I did it.”</p><p align="left">“You said it's for me, so I'm sure you know why you did it.” Agatha said as she put the tape in her pocket even if didn't quite fit there. She grabbed her drink and the fruit bowl then walked to the living room with a noticeable sway of her hips.</p><p align="left">Rio cursed herself several times as she followed her, leaving the box and its contents set in their place.</p><p align="left">“Put it on.” Agatha handed Rio the tape.</p><p align="left">And Rio did. </p><p align="left">“I—I haven't seen it. I don't even know if it works.” She said as she pressed play on the VCR player that she took out of the basement earlier, then she sat down on the other end of the couch.</p><p align="left">The video started playing. A 4:3 aspect ratio, constant static flickers, grainy texture on the edges and all over the screen. It looked like a late-90s VHS footage.</p><p align="left">It opened with Rio sitting on the edge of the big bed in her bedroom, staring directly at the camera lense. Wearing her work clothes—a white button-up shirt, black pants, a belt securing it tightly on her waist, and her blazer could be seen thrown behind her on the bed.</p><p align="left">Her dark hair was falling by her sides, reaching to her shoulders as it grew longer since she had cut it.</p><p align="left">She slowly started unbuttoning the first two buttons of her shirt, then propped herself up on her arms, while maintaining eye contact with the camera. She smirked.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at Agatha by her side. She was sitting with her legs spread widely, holding her drink with both hands in front of her while her eyes were glued on the screen. Observing. Witnessing.</p><p align="left">Rio in the footage started undoing her belt, slowly, until she pulled it and was out of the belt loops. She threw it behind her as she immediately undid the button of her pants, moved her fingers lower and unzipped it.</p><p align="left">She stood up, her face was out of the footage. She walked a step closer to the camera, then another one. Only her thighs and half of her upper body were on the screen.</p><p align="left">She pulled her shirt out of her pants then started unbuttoning the rest of it until all of them were undone. Rio slowly took the shirt off her shoulders and carelessly threw it on the floor beside her. She took a step backward and the back of her legs hit the footboard. Her face was still out of the footage—it appeared only when she sat down on the bed because of how she had set the camera—she sighed heavily as she started moving her hand on her skin, slowly trailing, from her collarbones down to the waistband of her pants.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s breath hitched as she let out a sound that was close to a moan but it was so low, almost inaudible. She set her drink down on the coffee table and looked at Rio by her side—who was intertwining her fingers in front of her—knotting them. Her knuckles were turning white. </p><p align="left">Agatha pressed the tip of her tongue into the inside of her cheek, looking at Rio with amusement. Rio’s heart kept pounding, banging harder the longer she kept her eyes locked on Agatha’s delighted ones. Feeling it hammering inside her chest, ringing in her ears. Her body was heating up and sweating—the clothes were so heavy on her skin. Intertwining her fingers anxiously, she could feel the regret creeping into the atmosphere, blending with the air—and god, looking at Agatha didn't help ease anything.</p><p align="left">Everything was intense and overwhelming.</p><p align="left">Until after a few, long seconds, Agatha looked back at the screen, and Rio exhaled a shaking breath.</p><p align="left">Rio was squirming in her place, not comfortable in the way she was sitting. She could feel her own weight overwhelming her as she listened to her heavy breaths that were coming from the videotape.</p><p align="left">So she lifted her legs up and stretched them on the couch—the sole of her feet almost touching Agatha’s thigh—and she rested her back against the armrest.</p><p align="left">As a few seconds passed while ignoring the creepy stillness of herself on the screen, and  she started remembering how it felt like yesterday while recording and doing instead of observing or witnessing—Rio realized the new position wasn't doing anything useful, she didn't even know if she was breathing, so she bent her knee up</p><p align="left">“<em>Sit still.</em>” Agatha said. Low, deep and commanding—it fucked Rio’s brain sideways.</p><p align="left">In the footage, Rio took her pants off then she sat down—back in her spot on the edge of the bed—her face reappeared, and Rio could see how she was flushed even with the low resolution, the constant static flickers and the blurred edges—despite it all she was able to see it.</p><p align="left">She was wearing nothing but her purple underwear—Agatha’s. That was when a louder moan escaped Agatha’s throat at the realization, and Rio felt herself drip down at the sound. She closed her eyes briefly, but they snapped open the next second.</p><p align="left">“<em>I miss you.</em>” Was the first thing Rio said in the video as she started slowly circling the skin around her navel. Delicate fingertips brushing with urgency. “<em>And I need you.</em>” She moaned as she placed her hands on the waistband of her underwear.</p><p align="left">Agatha muttered something as she took her shirt off her shoulders and threw it beside her on the couch. She unbuttoned and unzipped her pants, then she turned her face to the side and their eyes locked as Agatha lifted her hips up to take off her pants. </p><p align="left">Rio let out a sound that was low and soft, but heavy weighted and desperate in many ways—she was finally able to see what Agatha was wearing underneath and it made her mouth water—a navy-blue bodysuit.</p><p align="left">The pale flesh of her thighs was visible for Rio’s eyes to see and devour. And from the way she was sitting—looking at Agatha’s side—Rio could see how the fabric on her breasts was black sheer. See through. Mind-binding. It made her heart race.</p><p align="left">Agatha ran a hand through her dark, wild hair and Rio, <em>poor Rio</em>, was able to see Agatha’s rosy, hard nipples from there, from underneath the sheer—<em>Fucking Hell.</em></p><p align="left">Her walls clenched around nothing.</p><p align="left">Constantly convulsing. Leaking through her boxers.</p><p align="left">Rio in the footage kept teasing herself. Still placing her hands on the waistband of her underwear, only pulling it forward slowly to show her pubic bone momentary then she'd let the elastic hit her skin—the sound of it was loud in the stillness of the bedroom, and it was even louder between them both, sitting on the couch without talking, only the sound of their heavy breathing was filling the silence.</p><p align="left">Rio leaned back on the bed, looked straight at the camera then she lifted her thigh up—not that high, just enough to tease, enough to show the dark curled hairs that were peeking through the sides of her underwear. Enough to show the dark patch of wetness on the garment. Filling the screen with her messy arousal, making it the center of their focus—where their eyes immediately drifted and were glued.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s breaths got heavier.</p><p align="left">And a shiver ran down Rio’s spine that was more like an electric current swirling and shocking her.</p><p align="left">Rio couldn't look at the screen longer than that. She was feeling so many emotions and sensations creeping inside all at once, so she closed her eyes—and her hearing became sharper, voices were meticulous, more detailed—listening to her own desperate, lustful sighs through the footage blending with Agatha’s by her side.</p><p align="left">When she opened her eyes again, Agatha was looking at her with dark eyes and a famished look. The woman looked like a predator ready to pounce at any moment.</p><p align="left">“<em>Look at me.</em>” Agatha said deeply. Undeniably affected by everything.</p><p align="left">The moment their eyes locked. “<em>I need you to touch me.</em>” Rio from the footage said with a low, lustful tone, then she moaned deeply.</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed so hard. Her own voice traveled all the way down to vibrate between her thighs. Her walls clenched around nothing as she saw the way Agatha’s jaw stiffened. Rio could predict that Agatha was grinding her teeth inside her closed mouth.</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't break their intense, acute eye contact. She sat in the same way Rio was sitting on the other end of the couch. “Come closer.” She breathed out and Rio leaned her body closer until Agatha’s foot was right on her cunt above the fabric. “<em>Closer</em>.” Agatha demanded heavily and Rio did as she propped on her arms behind her—the moment Agatha’s foot got inside the fly of her boxers and pressed on her cunt, Rio moaned loudly. “<em>Oh, fuck.</em>”</p><p align="left">“Exactly, Rio. <em>Oh, fuck.</em>” Agatha started moving her foot, looking at Rio in a way that made her lose herself completely. Rio couldn't even think, not while feeling Agatha’s toes pressing on her.</p><p align="left">Rio in the footage got up and approached the nightstand. She took a cigarette, put it between her lips and lit it as she stared straight at the camera—then she smirked while walking to sit on the bed again. “<em>I put the mirror here so I could see myself.</em>” She said as she exhaled a cloud of smoke into the atmosphere while pointing at a mirror that wasn't appearing in the footage. </p><p align="left">She lay down on her back, staring at the ceiling with a smile visible even behind the cigarette.</p><p align="left">“<em>Why am I doing this?</em>” Rio laughed, looking to her side—up at the camera.</p><p align="left">“It's stupid, I know.” She rolled her body over to the side as she started brushing her skin with the hand holding the cigarette, not caring about the ash falling down on the sheets. </p><p align="left">“But it feels good. This is my… surprise for you? If you want to call it a surprise. I'm really bad at giving gifts—awful even. But… knowing that <em>you </em>love me… this should at least get a pass as good. I mean it's not something you'd want to watch willingly but you would if I shoved it down your throat.” She laughed, then her hand movements stilled. She lifted the cigarette up to her mouth, narrowed her eyes as she inhaled deeply.</p><p align="left">“<em>The same way I want to shove my tongue down your throat right now.</em>” Rio admitted as the smoke got out of her mouth and nostrils with every word she spoke.</p><p align="left">“Fuck.” She carnally moaned as she cupped one of her breasts and started squeezing it firmly.</p><p align="left">And the helpless woman on the couch moaned too as Agatha’s foot continued pressing on her cunt with her toes.</p><p align="left">Rio knew her arms were on the verge of giving up—not because her muscles weren’t able to hold her—but because of what she was feeling. What she was seeing and hearing. Listening to herself talking through the footage… Rio realized how goddamn insane she sounded. Completely out of her fucking mind.</p><p align="left">“Oh, <em>Rio</em>.” Agatha moaned out her name as she bent one of her legs up and ran a frantic hand through her hair. Then she moved the same hand down, <em>lower</em> on her body, moving on the fabric of her bodysuit, pausing a second on her breasts, then <em>lower</em> until that hand rested on her cunt—slowly moving on her heat through the fabric, and Rio, desperately, starvingly, ate up every second and movement of what she was staring at.</p><p align="left">Seeing the way Agatha’s thumb ring moved on herself and <em>feeling</em> it at the same time—or maybe it was just Agatha’s toes inside her boxers pressing on her leaking cunt. Adding more and more pressure, making her lose herself.</p><p align="left">“Agatha, baby, look… <em>fuck</em>.” Rio moaned as she moved closer and Agatha’s toes touched her throbbing clit only briefly. </p><p align="left">Agatha looked at her as her movements stilled on Rio and herself.</p><p align="left">“I just was… so turned on. I just…”</p><p align="left">“That much is obvious, my love. Now do you mind letting me watch you?” Although the words were almost casual, Agatha’s voice and her stare were anything but.</p><p align="left">Rio shook her head. Almost unnoticeable. Then she moved back slowly, about to put her feet on the floor when Agatha spoke. “Where are you going?” She put her hand on Rio’s shin, almost grabbing her.</p><p align="left">“I need—” a hard swallow. “I need to go to the bathroom. Be right back.”</p><p align="left">Rio didn't really want to go. She just… couldn't be present during the next act. The next part of the footage.</p><p align="left">The one that made her sweat whenever she thought about it—the fucking pornography.</p><p align="left">She spent a couple of minutes in the bathroom. Smoked a cigarette, washed her face and all, while thinking about how insane all of it was—regreting every second of it.</p><p align="left">It made sense yesterday when she did it. When she was pathetically turned on and drenched while thinking about Agatha. So the box of tapes that was set at the corner of the room gave her an idea—she breathlessly hurried to the basement and grabbed the dusty camera that she didn't even know was working or not.</p><p align="left">She missed Agatha and hadn’t touched her in three days because both of them were busy and even their sleep schedules were ruined—Agatha was working on a new project and was out of the house most of the day, and she'd be exhausted when she came back. She would shower, kiss Rio and embrace her then a few minutes would pass and she would be asleep and snorting softly—and Rio, she had her work to care about. Her plants to check on.</p><p align="left">So it all made sense at the heat of the moment, and yesterday, she fell asleep alone on her bed without Agatha to embrace her—and it was the first time in a long while.</p><p align="left">Rio walked down the stairs, picked up her drink from the kitchen island and walked to the living room. </p><p align="left">She looked at Agatha, then at the screen, then back at Agatha, then at the screen again. The video had stopped a few seconds from where she had left, paused on her lying footage—well... <em>fuck!</em></p><p align="left">Agatha smirked, she was still sitting with one of her legs stretched and the other bent up, and Rio was able to take her body in from that position.</p><p align="left">Fucking Flawless.</p><p align="left">The way the bodysuit hugged her body <em>perfectly</em>. Her thighs, the exposed, pale, captivating skin. Her breasts—<em>oh</em> god, her breasts. </p><p align="left">Rio was drowning, drooling. Unable to take her eyes away as her hold on the aluminum can tightened and her knuckles turned white. Until she heard Agatha chuckling. The deep, delighted sound brought her back to earth.</p><p align="left">“Sorry to disappoint you, baby. But we're watching this together, yeah? Come here.”</p><p align="left">Rio walked toward Agatha as she licked her lips. Looking at Agatha’s body, then at her face with the next step, until she approached her, standing in front of her with a chaotic head and a pounding heart.</p><p align="left">Agatha smirked as she put both of her hands on Rio’s hips and pulled her forward to make Rio fall on top of her for the second time that evening. </p><p align="left">Rio gasped, stunned, as she placed her hands on both sides of Agatha’s lying body. One arm slid down the gap between Agatha’s body and the back cushions, Rio’s palm pressing down on the fabric of the seat cushion. And with the other hand, she was firmly grabbing the rolled, couch arm.</p><p align="left">Her legs fell down to be stretched between Agatha’s spread legs and Rio was able to feel Agatha’s cunt right <em>on</em> her knee. Drenched and radiating heat.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">“Don't feel embarrassed because of this.” Agatha’s tone softened as she tucked a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. “This is the sexiest thing I've ever seen in my life. So… let us enjoy it together, yeah?”</p><p align="left">“Mhm.” Rio hummed. Helplessly, and desperately aroused because of the way Agatha was looking at her like she was the only goddamn person in the whole world.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned her face in. “You don't know how fucking turned on I am right now, baby. God, I've never been this horny in my entire life.” She breathed out the words on Rio’s parted lips then she lifted her hand up and fisted Rio’s hair. “<em>What did I do to deserve you?</em>” She said softly then pulled Rio’s head back by her fist in her hair, exposing her neck. Agatha didn't waste a second, she immediately started kissing and sucking on the exposed skin. Frantically and deeply.</p><p align="left">Rio moaned heavily and her body trembled. </p><p align="left">She moved her leg slowly on Agatha’s cunt and Agatha moaned on her neck. Her breath was warm against Rio’s skin and her voice was so <em>salacious</em>—heavily landing on Rio’s red ear.</p><p align="left">At the next heated second—their mouths crashed messily. All teeth and tongues and warm saliva drooling down the chins.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s other hand moved to the gap between her body and the couch—where Rio’s arm was shaking. She picked up the remote, pressed play and the video resumed. </p><p align="left">There was a sound of something moving and Rio immediately recognized it from the night before.</p><p align="left">So she pulled back slightly with heavy breaths and a rapidly raising and falling chest.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck</em>.” She cursed and both of them looked at the screen at the same time.</p><p align="left">“I won't touch myself, because… I want you to do that. And I can wait. I can control myself.” Rio laughed. “But I have something better to show you.” She said while she was still laying on her side on the bed. She inhaled the last breath of the cigarette, looked at it, then stubbed it right above her navel. </p><p align="left">Agatha glared at Rio who was half-lying between her thighs. She lifted Rio's crop top a little with hurried fingers and looked down at Rio’s abdomen where a small, circular, reddish spot was visible above her navel.</p><p align="left">She brushed her fingers tenderly on it, tickling Rio’s skin. “<em>Oh, baby,</em>” Agatha whispered, but Rio didn't look at her. She couldn't.</p><p align="left">Agatha licked her lips as she inhaled deeply, then she looked back at the screen—where Rio was <em>slowly</em> taking her underwear off. Making a show out of it. She threw the ruined garment over her head with a wicked smirk. Rio poked the inside of her cheek with the tip of her tongue as she slowly started moving a single finger on her skin, from her collarbones, lower to the valley between her breasts, to her abdomen, then <em>lower</em>, until it was resting on her cunt. Gradually moving her finger on her slit, up and down with unhurried movements and soft sighs escaping her parted lips. She looked at the camera again then she stopped mid-motion.</p><p align="left">Agatha whined the same exact second and bent up her leg—not knowing what to do with herself.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her glistening finger up and put it in her mouth. Sucking on it, moaning around her salty taste. Then she sat on her heels above the mattress, still sucking on the digit that was filled with her—taste, smell, and texture. All wrapped with her warm saliva.</p><p align="left">Both women on the couch gasped as Rio in the videotape turned around and sat on her fours. </p><p align="left">“Fuck me.” Agatha murmured as the leaking, glistening cunt filled the screen. “<em>Fuck me.</em>” The words were heavy as they escaped her throat and  she pulled Rio closer to her by the hips. Grabbing her firmly—Agatha’s short nails were digging in Rio’s skin. She was unable to look away from the screen, afraid she might miss a second. A detail. <em>A drop</em>. Licking her lips constantly, breathing heavily while tightening her hold on Rio’s body—as if she couldn't help but show how everything was deeply and constantly affecting her. </p><p align="left">But Rio? Rio couldn't even look. She didn't have it in her to turn her face to the side and see what was filling the screen—to see herself. </p><p align="left">The sounds alone were more than enough. Loud in her ears, ringing. The sighs. The moans. The squelch.</p><p align="left">Rio was looking at Agatha instead. Because that was who she really wanted to look at—the only one.</p><p align="left">She needed to see and take in the details of Agatha’s face. Her features and the expressions portrayed on her exquisite face—the tilt in her head. The dark strands of hair falling on her face. The obvious frown in her brow and the little wrinkle in her nose. The awe written all over. The gleaming of her wide, dark eyes. How her covetable, swollen lips were parted slightly, and the tip of her tongue would wet them over and over again, every few seconds. That was what Rio wanted to see, to get lost in, to memorize. </p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck me.</em>” Agatha breathed out for the third time. A heavy, deep sigh escaped her mouth and warmly landed on Rio’s face as Agatha’s body quivered, and Rio felt it deep in her bones—how could she not, when she was that close to her?</p><p align="left">As Rio in the footage started moving her middle finger on her slit, the sounds got louder. More obscene and soaking.</p><p align="left">She turned her head from that position to look at the camera—only her eyes and the bridge of her nose could be seen, the rest of her face was blocked by her shoulder.</p><p align="left">Rio smirked. “<em>Does it look good, baby?</em>” she said as she wiggled her ass. Then she lay down, with her upper body completely on the bed, leaving her ass up in the air with her knees still digging in the mattress. “<em>Oh fuck, Agatha</em>…” She moaned heavily as she spread her thighs wider. Her convulsing walls and leaking cunt were open for the goddamn lens. For Agatha’s eyes to see <em>and</em> devour.</p><p align="left">“<em>This is all for you</em>.” Rio moaned as she moved her finger on herself, the last few seconds started wrapping up—colors bled and lines stuttered. </p><p align="left">The video ended.</p><p align="left">The screen turned blue.</p><p align="left">The silence took over the atmosphere, only the blending of their heavy breaths and the whirring of the VCR player were trying to fight the silence.</p><p align="left">Rio pulled away from Agatha’s body. She removed her hands slowly and sat on the other end of the couch, she felt vulnerable in a revolting way. Watching and hearing herself acting like… <em>that</em>—it all looked and sounded like a version of her she buried years ago. The version when she acted the way she wanted, and strangely enough, she had the knowledge of herself and her desires back then—but that wasn't her now. That was why it felt strange, humiliating even. </p><p align="left">Because she couldn't even believe how twisted it was, that she had <em>actually</em> recorded a video of herself with a camera she hadn’t used in years. Taking her clothes off on camera and desperately touching herself, offering herself. Then she named the goddamn tape and gave it to Agatha—to her girlfriend—as a gift. An amusing surprise.</p><p align="left">Rio couldn't believe she did something like that and didn't leave it as a stupid idea floating inside her head.</p><p align="left">But that was what she really wanted, to offer herself to Agatha—not to give but to <em>offer</em>. To see if Agatha wanted to take her even if she was like... <em>that</em>. Showing off for her on a VHS videotape titled as: <strong>Your Porn Star, A.</strong></p><p align="left">That was the main reason why she pressed the record button yesterday. Because holding her old tapes did that to her, it was like an electric shock of some kind. Reading the wild titles she decided to give to her stupid, early-in-life adventures, reminded her that she <em>could still</em> be wild and unapologetic.</p><p align="left">But yesterday was yesterday. <em>The bulk punk bump</em> wore off and she was back to being herself—whoever the fuck she was.</p><p align="left">Agatha sat from her previous almost-lying position. She leaned back until her back rested against the couch armrest behind her with her leg bent up. Rio kept looking at how Agatha was looking at her, and Rio's heart pounded in her chest. She felt anxious because she couldn't read what was that look on Agatha’s face. It could be anything.</p><p align="left"><em>Anything</em>.</p><p align="left">“I just… it feels weird. I shouldn't have done it really… it's stupid.” Rio said as her eyes drifted down to look at Agatha’s foot—and <em>god</em>, she could see the viscosity on Agatha’s toes from earlier.</p><p align="left">When Rio lifted her gaze up, their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">Agatha closed her eyes briefly as she inhaled deeply. Once her eyes were open again, she sat on her heels, put her palms on the couch, arched her back and crawled the space between them until she was facing Rio.</p><p align="left">“Are you kidding me?” She asked with a low, deep voice. As if she was holding back something. She sounded <em>aroused</em>.</p><p align="left">“Are you kidding me, Rio?”</p><p align="left">“No…”</p><p align="left">Agatha didn't let her finish, she closed Rio’s mouth with her hand as she sat on her knees. Her palm was gentle, Rio could feel there wasn't any pressure or pressing, only softness on her skin and lips.</p><p align="left">“I don't want you to say…. <em>Oh, please, god</em>…” Agatha leaned in. Their faces were close. “Baby… this is perfect. Do you hear me? This?...” she pointed at the blue screen. “I can't even fucking describe it, Rio. You're so perfect… I don't even know what to say. I feel like my mind is elsewhere. Goddamn it.” Agatha stammered. Her voice was low and she looked like she was struggling to find the right words… or any words really.</p><p align="left">“Is that why you were so sure I won't be able to resist you tonight?” </p><p align="left">Rio nodded with Agatha’s palm still covering her mouth.</p><p align="left">“Oh, fuck. You're right, baby. <em>God</em>, your confidence in knowing how much I want you… how much I need you and can't resist you is so hot… and you recorded this for <em>me</em>, while you were so turned on and thinking about <em>me</em>… looking <em>that</em> beautiful. <em>That</em> fucking perfect and <em>delicious</em>. Making it so hard for me to control myself or even think of anything other than you and how in love I'm with you.”</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked. Agatha removed her hand to the side and cupped Rio’s face.</p><p align="left">The silence stretched between them. They were heavily breathing, searching each other’s eyes with anticipation and desire.</p><p align="left">“Do you regret this?” Agatha softly broke the silence as she brushed Rio’s skin tenderly. Her voice was so calm, so tender in its asking it almost made Rio cry.</p><p align="left">“No. I—I don't regret it...”</p><p align="left">“Then what is it, baby?”</p><p align="left">“Do you think this is me? Being like… <em>this</em>?”</p><p align="left">“Of course it is, my love… you're not just one thing. You're… there's so much in you, Rio. Not just one version or a certain way to act and behave. Everything you do is you no matter what it really is… and you don't have to always define it. You just feel it and… <em>do it</em>, and I love that so much about you.” Agatha kept searching Rio’s big, tired, brown eyes with her gleaming, soft, blue ones. “But do <em>you</em> think that is you?”</p><p align="left">Rio inhaled deeply as she lifted her hand up and rested it on Agatha’s wrist. Gently brushing her skin with her thumb in sync with Agatha’s soft movements on her face. </p><p align="left">She exhaled a heavy, shaking breath.</p><p align="left">“At the time… it felt right, yes.” Rio paused to take in Agatha’s eyes and calm the rapid beating of her heart. “I was so turned on, and you know… I missed you, so I just… I just did it and it felt good. I…” A hard swallow. “I was thinking about the time when you said you like watching <em>me</em>… and I told you I like to be watched by <em>you</em>…” Rio paused and Agatha nodded at her in acknowledgment. “So the idea flooded my head. It—it felt good to get my old camera. To, you know, adjust the mirror so I could see myself… to record and take my clothes off and... and touch myself knowing you would be watching it later… that <em>you</em> would be watching <em>me</em>, and... I knew you'd like it.”</p><p align="left">“I fucking love it, Rio.” Agatha exhaled deeply, her breath warmly reached Rio’s skin. “<em>Oh, baby</em>…” Agatha cupped her face with both hands, leaning closer.</p><p align="left">“It just feels strange to watch myself, you know?”</p><p align="left">Agatha nodded as she leaned even closer. Their mouths were a breath away.</p><p align="left">“<em>I know</em>.” Agatha breathed out, the words escaped her throat sounding like a heavy, aroused moan. And it was so close as it landed on Rio’s parted lips, causing her to whimper.</p><p align="left">“So…” Rio began. Her eyes drifted between Agatha’s dark, lustful gaze and her swollen, parted lips. “You still want to punish me?” She said the words into Agatha's mouth. “Still don't want to touch me?”</p><p align="left">Not a second had passed and Agatha closed the space between them. She crashed their mouths forcefully in a hungry kiss. Rio whimpered as she parted her lips, giving Agatha the space to get in. Begging her to take her—and Agatha responded in kind. She slid her warm tongue inside the heat of Rio’s mouth, and Rio moaned at feeling her lover and tasting her.</p><p align="left">Their tongues tangled and rolled with fervor and desire. Agatha slightly tilted her head to the side and deepened the kiss, taking all of Rio’s mouth in. Devouring it. Rio carnally moaned into Agatha’s mouth, the needy sound vibrated on their lips as Rio felt Agatha’s hands moving smoothly down on her body to rest on her hips. Hungrily trailing her fingers on the soft skin of Rio’s abdomen, higher and higher, until she cupped Rio’s breasts under her crop top. </p><p align="left">Rio wrapped her hands around Agatha’s neck and pulled her closer to her as the kiss escalated and deepened. Becoming messier and filthier, both of them unable to pull back. To control their instincts and stop devouring each other. Their bodies were alerted, in desperate need for each other’s touches.</p><p align="left">They pulled back after air became a necessity. Staring into each other’s eyes with heavily rising and falling chests.</p><p align="left">“You’re perfect.” Agatha said breathlessly as she slightly pulled her head back to look at Rio’s flushed face. Then she leaned in and kissed her teeth through her slightly parted lips. Tenderly pressed a kiss to Rio’s soft, swollen, upper lip then the bottom one.</p><p align="left">“<em>Perfect</em>.” Agatha moved her mouth lower and pressed a kiss to Rio’s chin, then a little lower to kiss her jaw. “God, baby. You drive me fucking insane…” She started sucking on Rio’s neck, right under her ear causing Rio to moan loudly. Struggling to suppress her sounds or even lower them. “You're right, I can't resist you…” she turned to the other side, sucking and kissing her with the same amount of lust, need and devotion. “I can't control myself around you.” Agatha shakingly breathed out the words on Rio’s skin as she started kissing her throat and going down to her collarbones. “You're the best thing that has ever happened to me, Rio.” Going down with her mouth, murmuring against the heating, sweating skin. Agatha started kissing Rio’s breasts above the fabric, then lower to her abdomen, pressing a kiss to that small, red mark. “<em>Ah</em>,” Agatha sighed heavily as she moved her body down. Her mouth was so close to Rio’s boxers as her hands rested on Rio’s hips. </p><p align="left">Rio looked at her with dark, half-lidded eyes. Desire and desperation written all over her face. Her body was on fire, her head was spinning and she was constantly dripping down. She needed Agatha to fill her.</p><p align="left">The moment Agatha spread Rio’s thighs wider, giving her that delicious, burning stretch in her muscles—Rio moaned out her name.</p><p align="left">“<em>Agatha… ah, fuck. S-show me—show me how much you liked my surprise.</em>”</p><p align="left">Agatha groaned as she took one of Rio’s legs and put it on top of the back cushions, letting the other stretch lower so Rio’s foot would be put down on the floor.</p><p align="left">“I will. I will show you, Rio.” Agatha said. “Take your shirt off.” and Rio did.</p><p align="left">She took her crop top off and threw it on the floor.</p><p align="left">Agatha was drooling down as she kept staring at Rio’s hard nipples with a famished look. “<em>Fuck</em>,” She lowered her body between Rio’s spread thighs and rested one of her hands on Rio’s stretched leg. Agatha arched her back then she leaned her head in and started eating Rio’s leaking cunt from above the fabric.</p><p align="left">Rio threw her head back as she closed her eyes. Her hips jerked up at the intense feeling she was desperate for all evening. To have Agatha’s warm mouth on her. She was so close already—because being with Agatha meant she'd always be close to coming undone.</p><p align="left">As Agatha continued moving her mouth and eating Rio out from above the fabric like a woman possessed. Biting and licking and sucking—Rio’s boxers were completely ruined with her juices and Agatha’s warm saliva.</p><p align="left">“Up.” Agatha said with a low, impatient tone as she rested her hands on the waistband and brought Rio’s legs back on the couch so she could be able to pull the garment off.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her hips up and Agatha pulled the garment down, then the next second she returned Rio’s legs to their places. Spreading her widely. Open and leaking for her.</p><p align="left">“Jesus, fuck. You're leaking down on the fucking couch, honey.” She said as she sat down on her heels and started moving her fingers on Rio’s slit.</p><p align="left">“Yes, god. I'm so… <em>I need you.</em>” Rio moaned breathlessly as she cupped her breasts and looked at Agatha with pleading eyes.</p><p align="left">Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose as she put the tip of her finger on the leaking entrance and started thrusting slowly. Not entirely in, just enough to feel Rio’s warm walls. To feel her dripping down.</p><p align="left">“This is the first time I see you this fucking wet… god.” She started thrusting her finger deeper and Rio felt her walls convulsing around the long, perfect digit. </p><p align="left">“I'm so close, already. <em>Please</em>.”</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked and Agatha pulled her finger out to suck on it with her whole mouth. And she moaned around Rio’s taste.</p><p align="left">“What do you want?”</p><p align="left">“Your mouth on me.”</p><p align="left">Agatha obliged. </p><p align="left">She arched her back and lowered her body again. Agatha stuck her long tongue out and started licking from the entrance up to the throbbing clit.</p><p align="left">Rio trembled as she started rolling her erect nipple with one hand while biting on her finger to suppress her loud, pathetic sounds.</p><p align="left">“None of that, let me hear you.” Agatha said without even moving her head up from Rio’s cunt. Rio felt the words on her, hot and maddening. Sending a shiver to run down her spine and making her leak even more.</p><p align="left">After teasing Rio for a few seconds and making her tremble and plead—listening to her sweet whines and moans—Agatha was done. She exposed the throbbing bundle of nerves with two of her fingers and started sucking on it relentlessly, with the intention to make Rio cum. She moved two of her fingers, slid them inside with ease and filled Rio up. Once she felt she reached the depth she wanted, her fingers stilled inside. Not thrusting, just filling. Agatha continued sucking on Rio’s clit, stopping every few seconds, curling her fingers upward, tickling the g-spot inside with her fingertips to double the intensity, then she'd stop the movements of her fingers to start sucking again. Slow at first, until the sucking would involve her teeth grazing the sensitive clit that she was able to feel it throbbing against her teeth.</p><p align="left">Rio was a mess lying on that couch. Heavily breathing and moaning her lover’s name out loud. Her heart was rapidly pounding in her chest. Sweat glistened her tanned skin and her hair was sticking on her face and cleavage. She was feeling the build-up. The teasing. It was <em>searing.</em></p><p align="left">Rio was lost, only focused on holding on to her upcoming orgasm that she knew would shatter her. Desperately in need for pleasure to flood her entire being.</p><p align="left">“<em>Please.</em>” She pleaded with a low tone, barely above a whisper, and Agatha looked up at her through her long eyelashes with the length of her tongue stuck out and licking. <em>And licking.</em></p><p align="left">Agatha started doing both at the same time, sucking and thrusting her curled fingers deeper inside Rio. Because she couldn't resist nor deny Rio when she pleaded beautifully like that. </p><p align="left">Rio whimpered as she felt her orgasm building up with scorching intensity. Her hips jerked up but Agatha’s resting hand on the inside of her thigh kept her in place. Stretching her burning muscles even more.</p><p align="left">“<em>Agatha</em>…” Rio cried out her name, feeling Agatha moving her fingers faster. Her body was unable to handle what she was feeling, she needed a release. </p><p align="left">Her breaths stopped as her body quivered with force. All of her muscles tensed and burned. Her walls clenched forcefully—shutting like a gate and keeping Agatha’s fingers as hostages inside. Her toes curled down. Her eyes rolled back in ecstasy and Rio came with a loud curse as her orgasm tore through her. Pleasure filled her, a wave after wave swirled inside her, and her body was shaking as Agatha continued sucking her clit while curling her fingers upward.</p><p align="left">Rio desperately tried grabbing the edge of the couch to ground herself. Her knuckles turned white but the grip didn't help her body stay in place—she was floating in the intense, delightful pleasure, not even feeling Agatha’s movements on her cunt anymore, but she sure as hell felt the effects on her body. She was high.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck</em>… <em>Agatha</em>…” Rio moaned loudly as she put her hand on Agatha’s hair and fisted it, not even sure if she wanted to pull her mouth away because it was too much or push her deep inside because it wasn't enough—<em>never fucking enough.</em></p><p align="left">Rio was acutely feeling the sharp, intense burn in her abdominal muscles as she tried lifting her body up, but her body continued shaking, not giving up just yet—her orgasm kept going on and on, it felt like she'd been cumming for hours, her heart might stop at any moment.</p><p align="left">Until Agatha stopped after a last suck and thrust and Rio threw her head back on the couch with a heaving chest and unsteady breaths.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked up at Rio, her mouth and chin glistened with Rio’s cum—the light in the living room reflected on her face, and her lips were curled up in a delighted smirk.</p><p align="left">“You look so beautiful when you cum.” Agatha confessed softly while she slowly and <em>carefully</em> pulled her fingers out, making Rio whine at the loss of fulfillment. Of feeling her perfect fingers inside her. “You look beautiful when you do <em>absolutely anything</em>.” She leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to the swollen clit—her lips barely even touched it but Rio’s body quivered and her eyes snapped open because of how sensitive she was. “Sorry.” Agatha murmured as their eyes locked and they helplessly smiled at each other.</p><p align="left">Then Agatha brought both of Rio’s legs down on the couch to stretch them. “My perfect, beautiful muse.” Then she put her soaked, sticky fingers inside her mouth and sucked Rio’s mess. Moaning around the taste as she moved her body up to be on top of Rio. </p><p align="left">Their half-lidded eyes stayed locked and Rio looked like… well, a mess.</p><p align="left">“I love you.” Agatha said after taking her fingers out of her mouth and putting them inside Rio’s. Both of them moaned in sync, a melody of desire filled their ears.</p><p align="left">Agatha was straddling Rio’s body, sitting on her stomach. After a few seconds, Rio was able to regain her energy and slowly steady her breaths. She placed both of her hands on Agatha’s hips as she continued sucking her fingers, enjoying the mixed taste of her pleasure and Agatha’s sweet saliva.</p><p align="left">Rio released the fingers with a faint <em>pop</em>. Her eyes widened and darkened the moment she realized how wet Agatha was sitting on top of her. Leaking through the fabric of her bodysuit down on Rio’s stomach.</p><p align="left">“Can we…” Rio cleared her throat. “Can we watch it again? I want to watch it.” She whispered, afraid her suggestion might land the wrong way—but the way Agatha’s pupils dilated and she helplessly moved her cunt on Rio’s stomach? It was all the confirmation Rio needed to loosen her muscles and exhale deeply.</p><p align="left">“Are you sure?” Agatha asked as she moved her hand—glistening with Rio’s spit—and slowly brushed her fingers on the soft skin between the valley of Rio’s breasts.</p><p align="left">Rio nodded then she moaned as Agatha rolled her hard nipple between her fingers. She was already dripping all over again.</p><p align="left">“I want to watch it with you.” Rio whispered again as she tightened her hold on Agatha’s hips. Her fingers creating red marks on Agatha’s pale flesh. “And I want you to ride my stomach… you can cum only when it ends. Can you—can we do that?”</p><p align="left">Agatha moaned again, louder this time as the suggestion hit her right between her thighs and she grinded her cunt down on Rio’s abdomen again.</p><p align="left">“Yes—fuck, of course.”</p><p align="left">Rio smirked. “Give me the remote.” </p><p align="left">Agatha turned her body to the side and tried stretching her arms backward to grab it from where it was lying at the end of the couch, not wanting to get down from Rio’s body—not even for a second. Until she was able to reach it. She grabbed it and handed it to Rio. </p><p align="left">Rio’s smile widened as she pressed the rewind button. She kept her finger there as the tape rewinded until the video was back to the start. She put the remote on the floor and the video started playing again and both of them were watching as Rio was once again sitting down on the bed and staring at the camera—at them.</p><p align="left">Rio moved her hand up, cupped Agatha’s breast and started palming it. She heard Agatha’s breath hitch and she started riding Rio’s stomach. Moving her clothed cunt up and down.</p><p align="left">Rio turned her head away from the screen and looked at Agatha’s face first, her neck second, then down to her cleavage. Rio was basically drooling at the sight in front of her—Agatha’s breasts were visible even through the fabric. Looking so fucking delicious under the black sheer. Her nipples were hard and proudly standing up. Urging Rio to wrap her mouth around them.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her body up to sit down from her lying position. Agatha looked at her—her eyes were gleaming with anticipation.</p><p align="left">Rio leaned her head in and took one of Agatha’s breasts into her mouth as she continued palming the other. Both of them breathlessly moaned at the contact.</p><p align="left">Rio could taste the fabric mixing with her saliva and Agatha’s skin. It was intoxicating. </p><p align="left">She couldn't help but bite on the covered nipple, shifting between sucking and biting while Agatha’s sighs and moans blessed her sense of hearing.</p><p align="left">Until Rio realized that she tore the fabric with her teeth and started feeling Agatha’s nipple inside her mouth. Rio moaned as she closed her mouth around the nipple, feeling Agatha helplessly grinding her cunt, chasing the delightful friction. Brazenly leaking down on her even through the fabric.</p><p align="left">Rio slightly pulled back and took a look at Agatha’s breast and how her nipple was peaking out, glistening with her spit. Then she looked up at Agatha and their lustful eyes locked.</p><p align="left">Rio licked her lips as she moved her hand from the other breast and used it to palm the exposed one while keeping the intense eye contact, looking at Agatha to see her reaction.</p><p align="left">“Tear it apart, Rio. I don't fucking care.” Agatha whispered as she lifted her body up just slightly then sat back on Rio’s stomach, and she started slowly moving her cunt again. A heavy sigh escaped her throat every time her throbbing clit had some friction.</p><p align="left">Rio moaned as she leaned in again and took the other breast in her mouth, sucking and licking then biting until Agatha’s hard, rosy nipple was out of the hole in the fabric.</p><p align="left">“<em>And I need you.</em>” Rio from the footage admitted then she moaned. Depicting exactly what Rio was feeling while sitting on that couch, naked, sucking on Agatha’s nipple while she was riding her stomach. </p><p align="left">Agatha moaned as she rolled her hips and lifted her head up. Exposing her throat, staring up at the ceiling with a mouth hanging wide open.</p><p align="left">Rio pulled her mouth away from Agatha’s breast then she leaned back on the couch. She stared at how both of Agatha’s nipples were hard, coated with her saliva and out of the two holes in the fabric she made with her teeth.</p><p align="left">Rio in the footage moaned again, that was when Rio was acutely aware of what was going on, and it overwhelmed her from the inside out again. It felt odd to hear herself. So she tried blocking the sounds coming from beside her—from her—and focusing only on Agatha and how beautiful she looked while riding her body like that.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted up both of her hands and put them on Agatha’s back, she slowly moved her hands on the soft, exposed skin, then she pulled the thin ribbon open. </p><p align="left">“When did you wear this?” Rio asked, trying not to hear the movements of what she was doing in that video. But the sound of the elastic hitting her skin was ringing in her ears.</p><p align="left">“When you were showering.” Agatha said, still looking up at the ceiling. Humping on Rio’s body, trying to put as much pressure as she could on her clit.</p><p align="left">Rio hummed and she continued moving both of her hands on the skin of Agatha’s back. It was so soft against her palms.</p><p align="left">“<em>I need you to touch me</em>.” Followed by a lustful moan.</p><p align="left">Agatha moaned at the sound of Rio from the footage. Her eyes snapped open and she turned her head to the screen, staring at Rio.</p><p align="left">Rio closed her eyes as her voice rang in her head. So she bent both of her knees up, lowered her hands and placed them on Agatha’s hips, then she lowered Agatha’s body down from hers. She pushed Agatha to lay down, her head hitting the end of the couch. Agatha gasped at the sudden shift of positions and Rio immediately got up and topped her body, placing her hands on both sides of Agatha’s head—just like a while ago.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked as their chests rose and fell heavily. </p><p align="left">Their faces were close, only a warm, heavy breath between their mouths.</p><p align="left">“That wasn't the plan, baby.” Agatha said breathlessly.</p><p align="left">“Fuck the plan, I need to feel you.” Rio leaned in and buried her face in the warmth of the crook of Agatha’s neck. She moaned as she deeply inhaled her intoxicating scent, as deep as she could. Filling her senses with Agatha. She needed to.</p><p align="left">Rio felt Agatha’s hands on her back, soothingly moving. Tenderly brushing her bare skin.</p><p align="left">“What's wrong?” Agatha softly whispered. Her words warmly landed on Rio’s ear and caused a shiver to run down her spine making her body tremble.</p><p align="left">“I—I can't look at myself.” Rio sincerely admitted with a low, vulnerable tone. As she buried her face deeper in Agatha’s neck until she wasn't able to see anything other than blackness with her eyes still open.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s movements didn't stop, she continued her soothing touches. Trying to calm Rio down.</p><p align="left">“It's okay. Let me turn it off.”</p><p align="left">“No, don't. You like it.” Rio said as she pressed a weak kiss to Agatha’s neck. She felt her lips shaking as she did so.</p><p align="left">“Baby... right now? It doesn't matter if I like it or not. Look at me, let's talk about it, yeah?”</p><p align="left">Rio sighed heavily as her arms beside Agatha’s head gave up and she lay down completely on top of Agatha’s body. </p><p align="left">Agatha gasped as she felt Rio’s weight suddenly falling on her, but her fingers didn't stop brushing.</p><p align="left">“I'm sorry…” Rio murmured against Agatha’s warm skin. She was smelling nothing but the dizzying scent of her love. Taking in the warmth of her skin. Feeling how her chest was rising and falling. How she was brushing her skin delicately. Feeling the safety of Agatha being so close to her—something she knew she would never get used to. And she realized that she wasn't hearing herself anymore and it was reassuring to her alarmed state.</p><p align="left">“What are you apologizing for? Hmm?” Agatha gently whispered, genuinely wanting to know as she lifted one of her hands up and put it on the back of Rio’s head. Securing it without pushing forward. She just wanted Rio to be safe in her hold. To protect her.</p><p align="left">Rio inhaled deeply then she exhaled a shaking breath on Agatha’s neck—at a loss of words. Not knowing what to say.</p><p align="left">What was she apologizing for?</p><p align="left">And she kept doing that for a few seconds to calm herself down, inhaling deeply and exhaling sharply. Trying to steady her breaths and organize her thoughts.</p><p align="left"><em>What was she apologizing for?</em></p><p align="left">Rio slowly pulled her head away from Agatha’s neck then rested it on her chest without a glance at her face—she really couldn't see her beautiful eyes at that moment. So Rio decided to listen to Agatha’s steady and soothing heartbeats instead. Pressing her cheek on Agatha’s skin as she looked to her side—at the screen where she was lying on that bed, smoking, talking about how she was bad at giving gifts. Looking at the camera and smirking. <em>That Rio</em> looked confident in what she was doing and that was oppressive to who she was at that moment.</p><p align="left">“<em>The same way I want to shove my tongue down your throat right now.</em>” </p><p align="left">A shiver ran down Rio’s spine and her whole body quivered above Agatha’s, both from the soft brushes on her back and hearing herself saying that.</p><p align="left">It wasn't the fact that she was saying or doing what she was <em>saying</em> <em>and</em> <em>doing</em>—Rio knew she was capable of such things. But it was <em>seeing and hearing</em> it. There was the problem.</p><p align="left">And Agatha seemed to notice how Rio's body quivered, so she tightened her securing hold on her head.</p><p align="left">“<em>Rio</em>…” Agatha called her name—and god how her name sounded so sweet out of her mouth. It was so sweet—making her realize how sour she was.</p><p align="left">Rio briefly closed her eyes, then she opened them again the next second, and as if the footage went mute all of the sudden, Rio wasn't able to hear herself anymore—a static noise replaced her words and started buzzing in her ears. Rio stared forward at the screen as she sank her face deeper against Agatha’s chest, wanting to dissolve. To escape herself in any way and exist only in Agatha’s embrace.</p><p align="left">Rio kept tracing her curves on the screen with her eyes. Her gaze drifted up and down, left and right. Seeing how her teeth appeared as she laughed. Her lips moved as she said something. Exhaling a cloud of smoke into the atmosphere and confidently stubbing the cigarette with her skin without flinching.</p><p align="left">And she remembered how she used to do that a lot in her youth. Stubbing cigarettes against the inside of her thighs, her stomach or palms. The momentary burn on her skin after a rush of nicotine used to send a jolt to her system. It was oddly satisfying and she for some reason liked the idea of using her body as an ashtray. To look at the red marks afterward.</p><p align="left">Rio’s eyes stayed locked on the screen as she looked at herself taking her underwear off, making a show out of it and throwing the garment away. Slowly moving her finger on her skin, lower and lower until the digit was between her thigh. Moving up and down her slit—Rio was helplessly and pathetically dripping down at the sight of herself—then she stopped mid-motion, denying herself the pleasure of the pressure. Rio kept looking at herself as she remembered what she felt last night, when fingers were moving on her body and her head was filled with the thought of Agatha.</p><p align="left">Rio spoke faintly—barely above a whisper. “What do you like about it?” She felt and heard the soft sigh Agatha released on her hair, relieved that Rio had finally said something. And as on cue—as if someone clicked their fingers right on her ears—the sound of the footage came back, sharper than before, and Rio’s eyes kept tracing herself, staring at how she moved to sit on her heels, then on her fours. </p><p align="left">In the midst of her spiral, Rio felt herself dripping down the longer she kept looking at the screen. It was overwhelmingly arousing to see what she was doing and what she looked like. So she moved her leg slowly, trying to ease the ache, but she became acutely aware of the stickiness between her thighs—was she seriously turned on by looking at herself right now?</p><p align="left">“I like it because it's <em>you</em>, Rio. Aside from what you're doing, it's you who’s doing it.” Agatha softly said with a low voice, not once stopping her tender movements on Rio’s skin, not even for a second. “What would you feel if it was <em>me</em> who you're looking at? If I was doing the same?”</p><p align="left">Rio’s heart stopped for a heartbeat then it raced in her chest the next second. She gasped, her stomach burned and her eyes flattered. She was still looking at herself and immediately started picturing Agatha doing the exact same thing as her in that video. Her body quivered as lust filled her whole being the longer she kept visualizing it. The footage was so vivid inside her head as she felt the absorbing sensations consuming her. The images were titillating. They looked so fucking hot and lascivious.</p><p align="left">“I think it would be perfect.” Rio whispered the admission after a few long seconds of silence. She lifted her head up, resting her chin on Agatha’s chest to meet her soft, blue eyes the same second the video ended and the screen was blue again.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked. </p><p align="left">Soft, tired and loving.</p><p align="left">“I'll keep watching it over and over again until I've memorized every detail of it, and even then, I'd watch it over and over again.”</p><p align="left">“Mhm.” Agatha hummed as she softly smiled. She lifted her hand up and tucked a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear.</p><p align="left">“I think…” Rio swallowed. “I get turned on when I see myself… when I'm like this.” she admitted as she lifted her body up slightly after realizing how all of her weight was on Agatha, but Agatha gently pushed her back and let her lay back down, not pleased with Rio feeling herself heavy on her.</p><p align="left">“And does that scare you?”</p><p align="left">“I think so.”</p><p align="left">“Why?”</p><p align="left">“It's not weird to you that I… get turned on by looking at myself?”</p><p align="left">“Why would it be weird to me that you find yourself attractive enough to the point that you get turned on? That's a good thing, baby.”</p><p align="left">“Do you? Feel attracted to yourself?”</p><p align="left">“Yes, I do.” Agatha smiled brightly and Rio mirrored her instinctively. Agatha’s soft smile was contagious.</p><p align="left">“Have you ever touched yourself in front of a mirror?” Agatha asked while gently running her fingers in Rio’s hair.</p><p align="left">Rio nodded. “Yes. A few times. The last time I did was because of… you. Because I was already turned on.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh</em>?” Agatha smirked and Rio blushed immediately, her skin was faintly pink. “Do you want to try something?” Agatha asked as she lowered her hand down and started brushing Rio’s face with the back of her hand.</p><p align="left">“What?”</p><p align="left">“Do you want to fuck me in front of a mirror? So you can see yourself. See what you look like and what you do to me.”</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed so hard, feeling her stomach twisting around itself while her muscles tensed and burned. Images of that happening immediately flooded her head and drowned her.</p><p align="left">“Y-yes. But do you…” She swallowed again, her body quivered as she saw the anticipated look in Agatha’s eyes. “Do you want me to?”</p><p align="left">“Mhmm.” Agatha hummed while biting down on her bottom lip, and Rio couldn't help herself but to let out a soft whimper at the sight.</p><p align="left">Rio licked her lips as she lifted her upper body up and placed her hands on both sides of Agatha’s head. Their eyes were still locked. Searching.</p><p align="left">She leaned in again and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s lips. “We should get up so I can kiss you properly.” Rio whispered as her eyes kept drifting between Agatha’s swollen, covetable lips and her gleaming, captivating blue eyes.</p><p align="left">Agatha placed her hands on Rio’s hips with a smirk. Her thumbs gently brushed her soft skin.</p><p align="left">They kept looking at each other with soft smiles until Agatha hinted at moving her body up so Rio got down, put her feet on the floor then stood up.</p><p align="left">She started searching for her clothes. She found her thrown, ruined boxers first and was about to put them back on, when Agatha spoke with a frowned brow to stop her.</p><p align="left">“What are you doing?”</p><p align="left">Rio smiled at her as she leaned down and grabbed her top. “So you can undress me again.”</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled, looking at Rio fondly. “You like it when I undress you?”</p><p align="left">“Of course. I like seeing the anticipated look in your eyes every time you undress me like you've never seen my body before. As if every time is the first.”</p><p align="left">Agatha got up from her place on the couch and approached Rio. She took the top from Rio’s hold with a smile then started dressing Rio by herself. She sat down on her knees in front of Rio, took the underwear then helped Rio step into it. Slowly moving the ruined garment up until the waistband was on Rio’s hips and she was dressed by Agatha’s hands—about to be undressed again by her.</p><p align="left">Agatha got up, and stood facing Rio. “I can't get enough of you.” she said then she crashed their mouths together in a deep, loving kiss. Rio’s hands were placed on Agatha’s hips—while Agatha’s slid underneath her crop top and rested on her back, smoothing her skin.</p><p align="left">Pulling each other closer and closer while tightly holding each other’s bodies as their tongues tangled and the kiss deepened.</p><p align="left">They pulled back, the sound of their lips separating during the last suck was loud and pleasing to the senses.</p><p align="left">“I'm gonna grab us some water.” Rio smiled as she continued drawing messy patterns on Agatha’s clothed hips. Her eyes drifted between her eyes and the peeking, hard nipples.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and pressed a kiss to Rio’s cheek while murmuring an “<em>okay</em>” against her skin. Then she pulled Rio’s body closer to hers, their chests flush against each other as she moved her mouth lower and started sucking on Rio’s pulse point. </p><p align="left">“<em>Baby</em>,” Rio whimpered as she closed her eyes, about to give up and get lost in the sensations.</p><p align="left">“Hmmm” Agatha hummed without making a move to pull her mouth away from Rio’s skin.</p><p align="left">“<em>Agatha</em>… go upstairs.” Rio weakly breathed out.</p><p align="left">“Okay.” Agatha pulled back and their eyes locked, a smug smile on her face.</p><p align="left">She pressed a kiss to Rio’s upper lips before she walked away. </p><p align="left">Rio kept looking at her exposed back and soft skin. Noticing the way Agatha swayed her hips as she walked until she was going up the stairs. And Rio kept looking at the place for a long time even after Agatha disappeared from her eyesight, and she snapped back into herself only when she heard the bathroom door closing.</p><p align="left">She looked around the living room. For a few seconds, she just let her eyes drift around the space without a specific thing to look at. Then she dragged her feet and grabbed her drink from the coffee table and gulped it down. Once the can was away from her face, Rio found herself staring at the blue screen. She took a step closer to the couch, leaned down and picked the remote up from the floor and turned the TV off.</p><p align="left">After picking up Agatha’s clothes from the floor and grabbing bottles of water from the fridge, Rio went to the bedroom.</p><p align="left">She sat down on the bed, waiting for Agatha to come back.</p><p align="left">Rio was looking at herself in the mirror—she forgot to put the mirror back in its place yesterday, so she was able to see her reflection while sitting on the edge of the bed.</p><p align="left">She was tracing her reflection with her eyes. Going up and down. Left and right. Looking from every possible angle.</p><p align="left">Her dark hair was tousled and messy, falling behind her back. Her lips were plump and swollen. Her skin was colored with hickeys and bitemarks—her neck, cleavage, hips and thighs. Rio noticed how the smile lines on her face became more visible lately, so were the wrinkles under her eyes.</p><p align="left">She exhaled a shaking breath, then she started gathering her hair with both of her hands, until she was able to hold it up with one hand as a ponytail. Rio lifted her chin up and looked at her face shape from that angle. </p><p align="left">Looking at her forehead, then a little lower to trace her eyebrows. She observed the color of her irises and how they were gleaming in the room light. She looked around her eyes. At the length of her eyelashes. Her nose, from the bridge down to the tip, then going from the tip up to the bridge then she'd look at her eyes again. She then drifted her gaze lower to look at her neck, even lower to her cleavage—tracing her collarbones, until her eyes drifted out of the slow order and Rio noticed her hard nipples and their shape underneath the fabric of her crop top. They were standing, grabbing all of Rio’s attention to stare at them. The longer she looked, the wider her foolish smile grew as she kept remembering her older days. She didn't wear bras most of the time, and whenever she was about to go out, Rio used to rub her nipples with her fingers until they were hard and proudly standing—they looked better that way, and only then she was ready to go.</p><p align="left">She moved her hands down to her stomach, placing her palm right above her navel. Then turned her body fully so she could be sitting right in front of the mirror. Rio looked at her expanded thighs because of her sitting position, seeing how the muscles were compressed. She slowly moved her hands on her thighs. Then up, she hooked her fingers around the waistband of her boxers and slightly pulled them down from the side to stare at the stretch marks on her skin, tracing them with her thumb while her other fingers kept holding the waistband to be pulled down. Without turning her body to the side, Rio moved her hand and placed it on her lower back, she started slowly brushing the fading scar with her fingers. She sighed as unwanted memories flooded her—she didn't want to dwell that much, she didn't want to dwell there at all—so Rio’s eyes drifted to look at how her bicep was flexed because of how her arm was stretched down and almost twisted behind her body. She lifted her arm up at the elbow and flexed it. Looking at the muscle standing out while tracing the visible line with her eyes. After a few seconds, she put her arm down, turned her face to the side and looked at her jaw. Then she opened her mouth to stare at the shape of her teeth. Looking at the gap between her front teeth and tracing the rows with her eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio heard footsteps approaching the bedroom and her lips immediately curled up in a smile as she sat straight on the bed.</p><p align="left">“Hey.” Agatha greeted with a soft smile as she entered the room with light steps.</p><p align="left" dir="ltr">The smile on Rio’s face widened as she looked at Agatha up and down. From her wild, messy hair and lower to her beautiful face. Drifting her eyes down to her cleavage and the slight blush on her pale skin. Rio licked her lips as she lingered for a few seconds to look at the hard nipples peeking out of the fabric. She slowly took in the bodysuit and how it was hugging Agatha’s body perfectly. Looking at her thighs, her legs, and down to her bare feet. Then going up slowly, taking the same path, worshipping her lover with her eyes and her pounding heart from a distance.</p><p align="left">Agatha approached Rio and sat down on the bed beside her. Tucking her legs under her as she lifted her hand up and started brushing Rio’s face tenderly. </p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">Rio leaned in closer, feeling Agatha’s hot breaths on her face.</p><p align="left">Then she connected their lips with a soft, tender kiss. Deliberately tasting Agatha’s mouth. She could taste the lingering taste of the cigarette Agatha had smoked in the bathroom—possibly to relax—mixed with the taste of the synthetic mint after she brushed her teeth and amalgamated with the sweet taste of her addictive saliva. </p><p align="left">Rio whimpered softly as she leaned in even closer to take Agatha’s mouth fully. She placed her hand on the back of Agatha’s neck to pull her closer, her skin warm against her palm.</p><p align="left">Her tongue slid inside Agatha’s mouth, it was only a matter of seconds and the kiss escalated and deepened as their tongues tangled messily. Rio could feel Agatha’s exhales, coming out of her nose and landing warmly on her skin as they continued devouring one another. Feeling the heat of their mouths and the scorching of their skin.</p><p align="left">They both moaned into each other’s mouths as the kiss reached the point of being way too <em>luscious</em> to get broken.</p><p align="left">The mix of Agatha’s intoxicating taste and their mixed, warm saliva was so good, so addictive. It seemed like their connected mouths couldn't be separated.</p><p align="left">The whimpers blended with the sounds of sucking as their breaths got heavier and heavier with every passing second.</p><p align="left">Rio moaned and the sound vibrated between them as Agatha fisted Rio’s hair to pull her closer—even if there was no closer.</p><p align="left">Rio kept breathing through her nose, trying to manage so she wouldn't have to break the kiss just yet. It was consuming and she didn't want to pull back. She wanted to get consumed.</p><p align="left">Until oxygen became a necessity and they had to pull back eventually.</p><p align="left">A string of spit connected their bottom lips as they looked at each other’s eyes with unsteady breaths and heaving chests.</p><p align="left">“How do you want me?” Agatha breathlessly asked as she loosened her hold in Rio’s hair, but didn't remove her hand entirely. Rio’s dark strands wrapped around her fingers.</p><p align="left">Rio brushed the back of Agatha’s neck with her thumb, gently moving on the small hairs there. She licked her lips—and she was able to taste Agatha on them.</p><p align="left">“I want to fill you up with my cock.” </p><p align="left">Agatha let out a pleased hum and nodded. “Okay.” She softly said and slowly moved her other hand to cup Rio’s breast from above the fabric. Using her thumb to brush over the erect nipple. </p><p align="left">Rio whimpered as she leaned in and kissed Agatha again. Not a tender kiss, it was a frantic, starved one with the intention to devour.</p><p align="left">She placed both of her hands on Agatha’s shoulders and pushed her down on the bed until she was lying on her back and Rio was on top of her, Agatha’s hold tightened in her hair again. </p><p align="left">Rio slightly pulled her head back and started kissing her way, from Agatha’s face, lower to her jaw and chin, then her exposed throat. Slowly moved her face to the side to reach the side of Agatha’s neck—biting her earlobe then kissing and sucking on her skin. Deliberately going down to kiss her shoulder, then lower to her collarbones. Until she reached her destination and took one of Agatha’s breasts into her mouth, tasting the fabric while sucking on the exposed nipple and palming the other. She moved up and down, then in a circular motion, feeling Agatha’s nipple being rolled in her palm while munching the other one.</p><p align="left">Agatha was heavily breathing, her eyes closed and her mouth hanging open and no sound coming out of it.</p><p align="left">“<em>Rio</em>.” She breathlessly moaned out Rio’s name and Rio felt her heart racing inside her chest.</p><p align="left">She moved her mouth to take the other breast inside her mouth and treat it equally as she lifted both of her hands to Agatha’s shoulders and slid down the straps of her bodysuit. </p><p align="left">Rio started deliberately lowering her mouth while kissing Agatha’s body above the fabric as she continued sliding the bodysuit down.</p><p align="left">She paused mid-act to take a look at the flush state of Agatha. The newly exposed skin and how beautiful she looked.</p><p align="left">“Want me to undress you in front of the mirror?” She said and Agatha’s eyes snapped open to stare at her.</p><p align="left">“Yes.”</p><p align="left">Rio pressed a kiss to Agatha’s abdomen then she got out of the bed. She approached the full-length mirror that was resting against the wall. Then she looked back at the room to know if she should put it somewhere else so they could look at it while they're in bed or to leave it in its current place. </p><p align="left">She turned her gaze to Agatha who was propping herself up on the elbows and looking at Rio with dark, half-lidded eyes.</p><p align="left">Her breasts were almost out of her bodysuit that was lazily covering her pale skin—hanging there, waiting for a tug from Rio to be completely off her body.</p><p align="left">“Should I…” Rio paused as kept drifting her eyes between Agatha and the mirror.</p><p align="left">“No, leave it. We could see just fine if we were in the middle.”</p><p align="left">Rio took one last look at the bed then the mirror to know what Agatha meant. She nodded then approached the bed again. </p><p align="left">Rio sat down on her knees in the center of the bed to look at her reflection from that spot for good measure, then she looked at Agatha with a smirk. “Okay, come here.” Rio said as she patted on the mattress between her knees.</p><p align="left">Agatha raised an eyebrow with the side of her mouth curled up in a delighted smile. They kept looking at each other’s faces in silence for a few seconds until Agatha decided to crawl her way to Rio while maintaining eye contact.</p><p align="left">“I love seeing you crawling to me.” Rio said once Agatha was on her fours, sitting in front of her. She fisted Agatha’s hair and lifted her head up and Agatha sighed heavily while still looking at Rio with a raised eyebrow and an amused smile. Making Rio acutely aware of how hot her body was. How aroused and lost she was. “You're so beautiful.” She whispered as her eyes roamed Agatha’s face.</p><p align="left">The moment Rio loosened her hold and entirely removed her hand from Agatha’s hair, Agatha turned around and sat on her heels in front of Rio as they looked at their reflection.</p><p align="left">They kept looking at each other’s faces, taking in the reflection of one another.</p><p align="left">Rio slowly moved her hands in front of their bodies and cupped Agatha’s breasts, she looked at Agatha’s expressions in the mirror then drifted her eyes down to her own hands moving—rolling the hard nipples between her fingers. Then she looked up at her own face.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted one of her hands up and gathered Agatha’s hair to put it on the other side, letting it fall on Agatha’s front, all the way down to cover her breast. She moved the same hand down on Agatha’s stomach then she leaned her face in and started kissing Agatha’s shoulder. She was addicted to the feeling of her lips on Agatha’s body, where she could inhale her deeply with every loving kiss she pressed on her scorching skin.</p><p align="left">Agatha softly sighed in relief as she put her hand above Rio’s and started guiding both of their hands to palm her breast. </p><p align="left">Rio kissed her way from Agatha’s shoulder up to her neck. “<em>My love</em>.” Rio murmured against her skin as she kissed and sucked on her pulse point, feeling Agatha’s body quiver in her hold and making her shiver in response. </p><p align="left">Agatha leaned back on Rio’s front and spread her thighs wider from how she was sitting. Her feet almost hit Rio’s knees because of their awkward seating position.</p><p align="left">Then Rio started pulling the bodysuit down Agatha’s body.</p><p align="left">Slowly moving her hands while heavily breathing, until Agatha’s breasts were completely released from the piece of fabric and right in front of Rio’s eyes to see and devour. </p><p align="left">Rio exhaled deeply as she lifted her eyes up to the mirror. She looked at Agatha’s body as she licked her lips and slowly started moving the back of her hand on the soft skin between Agatha’s breasts.</p><p align="left">The sight made her mouth water, almost drooling.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked in the reflection.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck</em>,” Rio breathed out near Agatha’s ear, causing her body to tremble noticeably. “You're luscious.” Rio avowed and she moved both of her hands up and cupped the perfect breasts in front of her eyes as the desire of wanting to feel them in her holds took over her.</p><p align="left">Rio leaned her lips near Agatha’s ear and whispered: “Take it off. I need to see you.” Then she licked the shell of her ear.</p><p align="left">Agatha moaned as she immediately pulled her legs and stretched them in front of her. She started taking the rest of her bodysuit and Rio's eyes didn't leave their reflection for a second, taking all of Agatha in as her hands stayed still in their place—filled with Agatha’s breasts.</p><p align="left">The navy blue fabric reached Agatha’s ankles, not wanting to lean her body down and take it off with her hand, so she used each foot to pull the fabric off from the opposite side, until it fell down on the bed and Rio gasped as she lowered her hands and placed them on Agatha’s hips.</p><p align="left">“Can—” Rio swallowed hard. “Fuck, can you open your legs?”</p><p align="left">A shiver ran down Agatha’s spine at the words and she complied immediately. Bending both of her knees up and spreading herself wide open.</p><p align="left">Rio let out an involuntary moan. She didn't know where to look. She tightened her holds as the strong smell of Agatha’s lust hit her nose and filled her body—salacious and rich, making her heart clench inside her chest.</p><p align="left">“Fuck… <em>fuck</em>! Agatha, you're so wet. You're <em>drenched</em>. Oh my god.” Rio stammered as she kept her eyes glued down at Agatha’s glistening, leaking cunt on the mirror. Unable to look away.</p><p align="left">“Mhmm. It's all for you, baby.” Agatha breathed out as leaned her body back and rested her head on Rio’s shoulder with a shaking exhale. Completely affected by seeing herself while hearing and feeling Rio. She was lost in the sensations as deep as Rio was drowning in them.</p><p align="left">“Yes. It's all for me.” Rio tightened her hold on Agatha’s hips. Her short nails dug in her pale flesh. “God. Fuck, let me just…” she slightly lifted her body up and stretched her legs on both sides, making Agatha sit between her spread thighs, her back flush against Rio’s front—Rio could feel the pressure on her hard nipples because of how Agatha was leaned back on her. It was delicious.</p><p align="left">Rio put her hands on the back of Agatha’s thighs and stretched Agatha’s legs slightly so she could maneuver Agatha’s lower body and lift it up, thus Rio could put Agatha’s legs—slightly stretched with burned muscles—again on the mattress, with her feet placed on both sides of Rio’s stretched legs on the bed and her bent up knees passing from above Rio’s.</p><p align="left">Agatha heavily moaned at the sudden shift in movements as she felt her body being maneuvered and lifted up with more than half of her weight in Rio’s hold then only a few seconds later she was seated again, with deliciously burning muscles and thighs spread even wider than before. </p><p align="left">Rio’s voice got stuck in her throat at the sight, she didn't even know what to do. Her eyes were glued on the mirror, taking all of Agatha in. Memorizing every inch of her.</p><p align="left">Her voice and words were trapped inside, she was unable to release any sound at that holy moment. </p><p align="left">Rio’s heart was rapidly pounding against her chest as she felt Agatha leaning back on her front even more. Pressing on her skin. Rio was intoxicated at the feeling of Agatha’s hot skin against hers. At the feeling of her weight on hers. Smelling Agatha’s addictive scent with every inhale and filling her whole being with her.</p><p align="left">Briefly, their eyes met in their reflection until their gaze drifted down—to how Agatha was leaking down.</p><p align="left">Agatha heavily moaned at the sight of herself. Her breaths were unsteady and her chest was rising and falling as she slammed her hands on Rio’s thighs loudly causing red marks to appear on Rio’s skin. “Fuck, baby. Look at what you do to me.” Agatha breathed out as she desperately dug her nails in Rio’s flesh to hold unto her. To ground herself from doing anything.</p><p align="left">Rio cursed under her breath with a lustful look in her eyes as she moved her hands from the back of Agatha’s bent up knees. Slowly moving down on Agatha’s skin until her fingers were going up and down her slit.</p><p align="left">They both moaned at the same time at the contact as Rio’s cold fingers continued moving from the heat of the leaking entrance up to the throbbing clit.</p><p align="left">“Fuck me, Rio.” Agatha moved one of her hands up, trying to hold Rio’s neck but ended up weakly resting her palm on Rio’s face.</p><p align="left">Their dark eyes locked in their reflection.</p><p align="left">Rio, with ease, pushed her index finger inside. Moving it deeper to feel the warmth of Agatha’s walls wrapping around her finger.</p><p align="left">“<em>More</em>.” Agatha sighed.</p><p align="left">Rio added the middle finger, just deeply resting inside without thrusting it.</p><p align="left">“Rio, <em>More</em>.”</p><p align="left">A third.</p><p align="left">Agatha moaned at the fulfillment as she managed to spread her legs even wider, and her hand immediately dropped down from Rio’s face to helplessly grab her thigh again.</p><p align="left">Rio slowly started thrusting her fingers while staring in awe laced with lust. She managed to move her other hand from beneath Agatha’s bent up knee and started moving her thumb in slow circular patterns on the swollen, throbbing clit.</p><p align="left">“You're filling me up so good, baby.” Agatha briefly closed her eyes as she tried—and failed—to keep her head resting on Rio’s shoulder. </p><p align="left">“God, Agatha, you feel so damn good around me. Warm and wet. So fucking ready for me.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Ah</em>, Rio. Yes, I'm ready for you. Fuck me, baby.”</p><p align="left">Rio picked up her pace. Thrusting slowly but deeply, reaching that spot while continuing rubbing with her thumb.</p><p align="left">Her eyes kept drifting between Agatha’s cunt filled with her fingers as she moved inside and on her, and up to look at Agatha’s flushed face. Her gleaming, dark eyes. The glistening sweat on her forehead and neck that Rio wanted to lick every drop off. How her dark hair was beautifully sticking on her skin from the side. Her teeth biting down on her bottom, covetable succulent lip that Rio wanted to bite on with her own teeth.</p><p align="left">Rio’s eyes momentarily drifted to her own face, sitting behind Agatha. She took her state in, recognizing herself, then she smirked and drifted her eyes down to focus on the movements of her fingers.</p><p align="left">In and out.</p><p align="left">She could feel Agatha dripping from between her fingers and down on the mattress.</p><p align="left"><em>In and out.</em></p><p align="left">She could see Agatha’s chest rapidly rising and falling.</p><p align="left">Could feel how Agatha’s muscles were tensing the same way Rio’s body was burning from head to toes. From the inside out.</p><p align="left"><em>In and out.</em></p><p align="left">She could feel Agatha’s feet slipping and her legs almost falling down on hers. Spreading even wider. Completely open while offering herself to Rio to take.</p><p align="left"><em>In and out.</em></p><p align="left">She could see the desire and lust in Agatha’s eyes whenever her eyes drifted up, and she could see her own—could see how much she desired and loved Agatha.</p><p align="left"><em>In and out.</em> Faster. </p><p align="left">Rio’s nose was filled with Agatha’s scent and she could feel how her mouth was watering at the sight in front of her and how good it looked Rio realized that she was actually drooling down because of how her mouth was open in awe and her spit almost fell down on Agatha’s shoulder before she became aware.</p><p align="left">Rio was rubbing the clit slowly, then speeding up after a couple of seconds to increase the intensity and match it with how deep her fingers were reaching inside Agatha, hitting her g-spot with every thrust. And she kept doing that over and over again.</p><p align="left">“<em>I'm close</em>…” Agatha breathed out as she moved one of her hands up and pinched her nipple.</p><p align="left">“Cum for me. Cum on me.”</p><p align="left">Agatha cried out as her feet slipped down on the mattress and her legs fell above Rio’s. Her toes curled down and every muscle tensed. Agatha closed her eyes and grabbed the flesh of Rio’s thighs harshly, bruising her skin. She gasped as Rio bit down on her earlobe then went lower to suck on her pulse point repeatedly, while frantically thrusting inside her. “<em>Rio</em>…” Agatha heavily breathed out her name and she leaned back with so much force on Rio’s body with—Agatha almost made Rio fall down on her back.</p><p align="left">Rio shakingly exhaled against Agatha’s neck. “Open your eyes. Look at me, baby.” Rio said on her scorching, sweating skin before she pressed a kiss there and Agatha’s eyes weakly opened to meet Rio’s eyes in the mirror. “Does it feel good? Hmm?”</p><p align="left">“So fucking good…”</p><p align="left">“Cum, baby.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck!”</em> Agatha came with a loud curse. Her voice was wall-crashing, making Rio’s heart pound with craving against her ribcage.</p><p align="left">Her muscles tensed. Her walls clenched, trapping Rio’s fingers inside. But Rio continued thrusting with the little space she had to work with while still rubbing on her clit. Agatha’s body quivered forcefully. Sweat glistening her skin as her orgasm kept going on and on and Rio kept fucking her through it until the last drop. </p><p align="left">Agatha was drained out, her body was still trembling with Rio’s fingers still filling her. Her muscles loosened once Rio stopped rubbing on her clit. Agatha abruptly leaned her body back with a sigh of relief that immediately turned into a hiss once she made Rio fall down on the bed and she fell down on top of her and Rio’s fingers slipped out of her. Agatha’s back was flush against Rio’s front.</p><p align="left">Rio gasped at the sudden fall as she felt all of Agatha’s weight on hers. She pulled her legs closer and was about to wrap Agatha’s body with her arms to secure and hold her, but Agatha slipped her body down on the mattress with a sigh. She lay on her back with her eyes closed and her chest rising and falling. </p><p align="left">Rio retreated from the sudden fall. She looked to her side—at Agatha. She traced her face with her eyes as she leaned closer until she was lying beside Agatha and could feel the heat radiating from her body while listening to her soft sighs.</p><p align="left">Rio pressed her lips on top of Agatha’s head and pressed a gentle kiss there. Then she started kissing her sweating forehead—could taste the salty taste of Agatha’s skin. She pressed a kiss between her eyebrows. Another one on the tip of her nose. A small, soft one on the philtrum. Until Rio reached Agatha’s parted lips and pressed several kisses to each lip.</p><p align="left">Agatha was still trying to steady her breaths and calm herself down. She lazily lifted one of her hands and placed it between her breasts and kept it there, as the other hand remained stretched on the bed.</p><p align="left">Rio’s eyes were locked on Agatha’s beautiful face, lost in her features with a racing heart.</p><p align="left">She started gently brushing Agatha’s skin with her fingers. Deliberately moving in a soothing way. Trying to calm her lover and to bring her down from her high, and she kept doing that for a couple of silent seconds.</p><p align="left">“<em>God, Rio</em>.” Agatha breathed out into the atmosphere. Her voice dripped sweetly in Rio’s ears. “I've never come this hard…” she limply confessed and Rio smiled widely as she leaned even closer so she could bury her face in Agatha’s neck and inhale her in. “I feel like it's still going.”</p><p align="left">Rio pressed a kiss to Agatha’s cheek then sat down and was about to get up but Agatha opened her eyes and looked at Rio with her beautiful, half-lidded, ocean-y eyes. Agatha weakly grabbed Rio’s wrist and started brushing the soft skin with her thumb as their eyes locked. “Don't go.” she said. Her voice was barely above a whisper.</p><p align="left">“I'll bring you water, baby,” Rio said, smiling.</p><p align="left">She lifted Agatha’s hand up to her mouth and kissed the back of it deeply as she felt herself drowning in those beautiful eyes for the thousandth time. She lifted Agatha’s hand even higher and rested it on her face while keeping her hand above it. </p><p align="left">Agatha turned her body to the side and cupped Rio’s face with the same hand. Gently moving her thumb on the lower part of Rio’s jaw. </p><p align="left">They stayed like that. Looking at each other’s eyes, searching their faces while their chests rose and fell in sync.</p><p align="left">Rio leaned down and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s temple before she got out of bed. She approached the night stand where she had put the bottles earlier. </p><p align="left">Then she came back and sat down beside Agatha’s lying body again. </p><p align="left">Agatha propped up on her arms and was about to take the water from Rio’s hold, but Rio opened the bottle and held it up for Agatha to drink, then she wiped the edges of her mouth with her thumb.</p><p align="left">Agatha threw her body down on the bed again with a deep exhale as she closed her eyes again, as if she couldn't keep them open for longer than a few seconds.</p><p align="left">Rio tightly closed the bottle and threw it somewhere, then she immediately lay down beside Agatha. Rio wrapped her arms around her body and held her as she gently pulled Agatha closer to her.</p><p align="left">Agatha lifted her hand up and placed it on Rio’s back under her crop top and embraced her back with a tight hold. She leaned her face even closer and buried her face in the crook of Rio’s neck. Her breaths were warm on Rio’s already burning skin. </p><p align="left">Their hearts were pounding inside their chests and against each other.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her hand up and started tenderly brushing Agatha’s hair. Delicately running her fingers in the dark, tangled strands as she tightened her hold on Agatha’s body.</p><p align="left">“Just give me a few minutes.” Agatha murmured against Rio’s skin as she buried her face even deeper—Rio could feel Agatha’s nose pressed on her neck.</p><p align="left">“Take your time, my love.”</p><p align="left">They embraced each other in tranquility and peacefulness. Wrapped in the soothing warmth of their bodies for a few minutes. Listening to their breaths becoming steady and their heartbeats calming down from their pounding state.</p><p align="left">Rio continued to gently run her fingers in Agatha’s hair, trying to get rid of the knots with sensitivity to not disturb her in any way.</p><p align="left">Rio would’ve thought that Agatha was asleep in her arms because of how serene and still she was, but Agatha was tenderly pressing those feather-like kisses on Rio’s skin every few seconds. They were delicate and tickling, making Rio’s heart grow wings and flutter in her chest every time Agatha’s soft lips made a gentle contact with her skin.</p><p align="left">Embracing Agatha was soothing to Rio’s whole being. It was healing—to hold her and feel her that close. To almost collide and dissolve in each other’s arms.</p><p align="left">Rio didn't get to cuddle Agatha like that so often, because she was the little spoon most of the time—lying on Agatha’s chest while feeling her head rising and falling with her chest. Listening to her steady heartbeats and securely embraced in her arms while feeling Agatha’s soothing fingers in her hair. Massaging her skull and releasing all tension in Rio’s body.</p><p align="left">But whenever Rio got the splendid and <em>holy</em> chance to hold the love of her life like that, everything around them would still in serenity. Everything outside would stop, become soundless, and they would be peacefully wrapped in each other’s arms. Lovingly. Feeling how alive they are in each other’s embrace. </p><p align="left">How alive they <em>become</em> in each other’s embrace.</p><p align="left">There were a few times when Rio would wake up to find herself holding Agatha’s body while she'd be burying her face deeply in Rio’s skin and breathing her in unconsciously. And every time that happened, Rio would stop breathing so she wouldn't disturb the moment in any way. She would look at it as if it's something divine, because it was.</p><p align="left">“What are you thinking about?” Agatha whispered, her words warm and mellow against Rio’s skin. Then she slightly pulled back while still embracing each other.</p><p align="left">Their eyes met as they gently kept brushing each other’s skin.</p><p align="left">Rio fondly smiled at the sight of Agatha. She looked so beautiful. So graceful.</p><p align="left">Rio lifted her hand up and tucked a strand of dark hair behind Agatha’s ear, then she started brushing the soft skin of her face with the back of her hand without breaking the holiness of the eye contact—Agatha’s eyes looked so beautiful. Gazing at Rio with <em>such</em> tenderness.</p><p align="left">“About how good you feel between my arms. I love holding you.” Rio sincerely answered.</p><p align="left">Agatha softly hummed, the words caused a faint blush to appear on her pale skin as she widely smiled—a big, bright smile that adoringly pushed her cheeks up, reaching all the way up to her loving eyes. Making her exquisite wrinkles show and become more obvious—gracing her paradigmatic face.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and pressed a tender kiss to Rio’s upper lip, then she pulled back, her lips curled up in a knowing smirk.</p><p align="left">Their eyes stayed locked.</p><p align="left">Searching in anticipation.</p><p align="left">“I'm not done. I still want you to fill me up.” Agatha said as she took a strand of Rio’s hair and started rolling it around her finger.</p><p align="left">“And I still want to fill you up, my love.” Rio responded as she leaned her face closer—the tips of their noses softly brushing. Feeling their warm breaths on their faces.</p><p align="left">Agatha slowly pulled her hand down from underneath Rio’s top. Lower, until she grabbed her butt.</p><p align="left">Rio exhaled a deep breath as she licked her lips that became dry all of the sudden.</p><p align="left">But Agatha didn't linger on her butt, she lifted her hand up and placed it on Rio’s shoulder. Agatha gently pushed Rio to roll and lay down on her back, then she was straddling her the next second.</p><p align="left">Rio moaned at feeling Agatha’s weight settling on her body while feeling her cunt already dripping down again on her stomach. She lifted her hands up and placed them on Agatha’s shins and started slowly moving, up and down, while looking up at Agatha sitting on her stomach—she looked <em>ethereal</em>.</p><p align="left">“Lift your hands up.” Agatha said as she arched her back forward and leaned in while deliberately moving her hands on Rio’s scorching skin underneath the fabric.</p><p align="left">Rio did as she was told.</p><p align="left">She kept her eyes locked on Agatha as she licked her lips as she lifted her hands up.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned even closer, intentionally grinding her cunt down on Rio’s stomach as she did so, causing Rio to swallow hard, the sound of her throat popping was so loud between them. Agatha put her soft lips on Rio’s, not kissing her yet, just there. Slowly moving her lips against Rio’s while delicately palming Rio’s skin.</p><p align="left">Then she stuck her warm tongue out and started moving the tip of it left and right Rio’s bottom lip—even though Rio’s lips were parted, and she parted them even wider to grant Agatha the access, Agatha didn't slide her tongue inside to take what hers and give Rio what she desperately needed. Agatha was just there, to tease and to be present. Salaciously haunting Rio’s every sense—and Rio thought, that if she could cum from only feeling Agatha’s lips deliciously and agonizingly stimulating hers, she fucking would. </p><p align="left">Rio lowered one of her hands and tried placing it on the back of Agatha’s neck, but Agatha looked up at her with a wide smirk as she grabbed Rio’s wrist and put it right back in its place—stretched up above her head.</p><p align="left">Then eventually, after seconds and seconds of teasing, Agatha pressed a soft peck to Rio’s lips before she slowly moved her hands lower on Rio’s body as she sat straight on her stomach. Their eyes locked as Agatha placed her hands on the hem of Rio’s crop top. </p><p align="left">Her smirk widened as she hooked her fingers around the hem and lifted the top up until it was off Rio’s body and over her head, then it got thrown somewhere.</p><p align="left">Agatha inhaled deeply as she looked down at Rio’s body. Her eyes drifting to take in every inch of the exposed skin—and Rio? Rio was looking at Agatha’s gleaming eyes. Seeing how she was staring down at her body with that anticipated look as if she had never seen Rio’s body. <em>As if it was the first time.</em></p><p align="left">Agatha licked her lips as she brought one of her hands up to cup Rio’s breast. Gently kneading it in circular motions, Rio’s hard nipple pressing against her palm. And she slowly moved her other hand behind her on Rio’s body. Passing the waistband of her boxers until Agatha entered her hand through the fly of the garment and started scratching the dark, curled hairs there with her short nails.</p><p align="left">“<em>Agatha</em>.” Rio exhaled sharply as she fought to keep her eyes open once Agatha started moving her thumb on her cunt. She could feel the goddamn cold silver against her heat and it was oddly satisfying. Rio tightened her hold on Agatha’s shins and closed her eyes shut with a heavy sigh once Agatha started moving her thumb on her slit. Down from her entrance then going up to press on her clit while she was also feeling the delicious pressure on her hard nipple caused by Agatha’s other thumb.</p><p align="left">Rio’s chest was heavily rising and falling down. Her breaths were uneven, her heart was pounding rapidly and she could feel her orgasm building up at an intense speed. </p><p align="left">She loudly moaned as she felt the tip of Agatha’s thumb resting on her entrance. And Agatha started slowly sliding it inside and Rio swallowed at feeling the cold silver inside her.</p><p align="left">“<em>Agatha</em>.” Rio called her name again with a heavy sigh.</p><p align="left">The next second, Agatha’s movements completely stopped and Rio’s eyes snapped open to look at Agatha staring down at her.</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled both of her hands away and Rio whined at the loss of friction. Then Agatha arched her back again and leaned in to connect their mouths in a heated kiss—exactly what Rio was in desperate need for.</p><p align="left">Agatha pulled back and started kissing Rio’s skin while her hands moved on Rio’s sides. Sliding down with her body and mouth. She pressed several kisses to Rio’s neck. Her collarbones and cleavage. Deep ones to her breasts. And a specific, soft kiss to the small, visible, red mark above Rio’s navel. </p><p align="left">Agatha continued her path of kisses. Trailing lower and lower with her soft lips pressed on Rio’s skin until she was sitting between Rio’s parted thighs and her mouth had reached the waistband of Rio’s boxers—the destination.</p><p align="left">Agatha immediately slid the garment down until it was off Rio’s legs and threw it somewhere before she bent both of Rio’s knees up to create some space for her there.</p><p align="left">Her dark, blue eyes kept drifting between Rio’s face and her leaking cunt. The instinct to devour was written all over her face but she did nothing to do so. Rio propped her body up on her arms and her eyes momentarily drifted to the mirror behind Agatha and in front of her. She took a glance at Agatha’s back, tracing her dark, cascading hair and looking at the places of a few dark moles gracing her skin. Then her eyes locked on Agatha—who was still just looking at her.</p><p align="left">“What do we do now?” Rio smirked </p><p align="left">Agatha mirrored her as she lifted one of her hands up and cupped her face. Gently brushing her skin.</p><p align="left">“Now, my love…” Their eyes locked as Agatha lowered her fingers down and started moving her thumb—that was still glistening and tasting like Rio—on Rio’s bottom lip, causing her to immediately part her swollen lips and take a little taste of herself on the tip of Agatha’s finger. “You get up and get your cock” Agatha slid her thumb inside Rio’s mouth and Rio moaned around the taste and the feeling of that ring that had been driving her wild all night finally inside her mouth to suck it clean. “I want you to fill me up and <em>unravel</em> me.” Instead of letting Rio roll her tongue around her finger, Agatha was the one moving her thumb on Rio’s tongue and guiding it. “Can you do that for me, baby?” She finished talking as she started moving the tip of her finger on the lower row of Rio’s teeth while she looked at her with hungry eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio nodded eagerly, the side of her lips was curled up in a knowing smirk as she slightly bit down on Agatha’s thumb. </p><p align="left">Agatha adoringly pouted her lips, a smile visible on her features.</p><p align="left">As she slid her saliva-coated thumb away once Rio’s teeth released it and she placed it on her chin. “I want to take you from behind.” Rio suggested as she ran a hand through her hair, and stayed propped up on one arm.</p><p align="left">Agatha raised her brow in amusement. “I was thinking the same.” she said with a delighted smirk, then her starved eyes drifted to look at Rio’s abdomen that was glistening with Agatha’s juices when she was straddling her and Rio’s abdomen was visibly segmented because of how she was propping up on her arm and leaning forward—and Rio’s eyes followed Agatha’s to land on her stomach then she looked up to see <em>that</em> look again in Agatha’s eyes.</p><p align="left">Agatha removed her hand away from the inside of Rio’s thigh and rested it on her stomach instead as she started brushing her fingers on her skin.</p><p align="left">Rio couldn't help but giggle at the tickling sensation that filled her body, and Agatha seemed amused by every sound coming out of Rio’s throat so she kept moving her fingers intentionally. </p><p align="left">“Hey!” Rio protested through a helpless giggle as she desperately tried keeping her body up. Putting all of her weight on her arms to stay propped up while feeling the intense building up inside her body. Flames swirling inside her stomach all the way down to her cunt, feeling her pulse pounding there.</p><p align="left">“Agatha, stop it!” Her giggle turned into an involuntary, heavy moan once she saw the wicked smirk and delighted look on Agatha’s face who continued tickling her.</p><p align="left">“Why?” Agatha bit down on her bottom lip as she moved both of her hands and started attacking Rio’s sides.</p><p align="left">“Fuck!” Rio breathlessly laughed through a curse. </p><p align="left">The more Agatha kept attacking her with her fingers, the more Rio felt the intensity building up inside her body. Scorchingly increasing until she couldn't fight it anymore. Her arms gave up and she forcefully threw her body on the bed and stretched her leg down. The intended gasp escaped her throat like a filthy, sinful moan.</p><p align="left">Rio brought her hands up to try and grab Agatha’s wrists to stop her, but to no avail. Rio was so turned on, her body was too weak to function properly, and her hands were just resting on Agatha’s wrists without any real effect.</p><p align="left">Her moans grew heavier and heavier, mixed with her helpless giggles and uneven breaths as Agatha continued tickling her sides knowing it was where Rio was ticklish the most.</p><p align="left">“Baby…” Rio breathlessly tried to speak through a giggle. Desperately trying to breathe properly. And it was too late when Rio realized Agatha was pinning her down by sitting on her thighs, that meant, even if she was on the fight-or-flight mode, Rio she couldn't escape nor fight. She was too lost in the sensations, she wasn't even able to feel Agatha’s weight on her. She could only feel her hands attacking her none-stop. “Stop it…” Rio’s body was burning. Set aflame from the inside out. She could feel herself leaking down while her heart raced in her chest. It was as if someone punched her in the guts and knocked all the air out of her lungs. Her vision turned blurry so she closed her eyes shut while feeling her boiling blood running inside her body and hearing nothing else other than her loud laughter. “I think… fuck!” She yelled through high-pitched laughs. “I'm gonna pee, Agatha!” </p><p align="left">Agatha stopped tickling her, and Rio was relieved. She inhaled deeply as she kept her eyes locked on the ceiling. Her heart was rapidly pounding in her ears as sweat glistened her flush skin.</p><p align="left">Rio felt Agatha sitting down between her thighs again after she bent her legs up.</p><p align="left">Rio was too fucking lost to realize what Agatha’s plan was, and she loudly cried out once Agatha started tickling the inside of her thighs and resumed her assault. </p><p align="left">“Noooo!” Rio whined as she felt all of her muscles tensing and she started laughing hysterically.</p><p align="left">“Your body is so sensitive.” Agatha said through a wicked chuckle as she kept holding Rio back whenever she tried pulling her legs away.</p><p align="left">Then without a warning, Agatha slid both of her hands slowly until they were on Rio’s cunt and she, with ease, slid her middle fingers inside and thrusted them in with one deep thrust.</p><p align="left">“<em>FUCK ME!</em>” Rio cursed as her toes curled down. Before she could stretch her legs on the mattress because of how overwhelming and oddly satisfying everything was—Agatha hooked both of Rio’s legs around her waist and leaned even closer so she could be centred in front of Rio’s cunt, and she continued thrusting her fingers in and out. Slow and deep but not quite enough to give Rio the release she desperately yearned for.</p><p align="left">“God, I love how wet you get for me.” Agatha started rubbing the throbbing clit with her other hand. Gently at first, switching between tapping and rubbing in calculated shifts. Then she stopped her thrusts and let the tips of her fingers placed on the leaking entrance as she picked up her pace—speeding up to rub the throbbing bud without the intention to penetrate again any time soon.</p><p align="left">“I'm so fucking close already, <em>please</em>.” Rio whined as she tremblingly grabbed the sheets by her sides. Her knuckles were turning white. She felt as if the air was being sucked out of her body with every rub. With every time the cold silver of Agatha’s ring made contact with her heat. With every flick of Agatha’s wrist and every hungry, delicious sound her throat produced.</p><p align="left">Rio was feeling the intensity building up everywhere, all of her muscles were tense and her toes were helplessly curled down while her legs were wrapped around Agatha’s middle.</p><p align="left">As if her whole being was set on fire and at the same damn time she was floating. She couldn't even think of anything other than Agatha’s movements on her clit and how fast and scorching her orgasm was building up waiting for the right touch to flood her body whole with pleasure.</p><p align="left">“Can you breathe for me?” Agatha said as her movements slowed down for a few seconds, enough to make Rio go insane, only to start rubbing again—even faster than before.</p><p align="left">“<em>Agatha</em>.” Rio breathlessly moaned out her name as she closed her eyes shut and harshly dug her heels in Agatha’s spine without any sense.</p><p align="left">After a few seconds, she understood what Agatha told her and she tried doing as she was told, but her body was alerted, and every attempt to steady her breaths was a failed one.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s movements didn't slow this time, she stopped entirely. Without even giving Rio the time to whine at the loss, Agatha slightly arched her back and leaned her face in, then she blew a deep breath on Rio’s cunt that was way <em>too</em> cold to how hot she was feeling.</p><p align="left">Rio moaned weakly as her entire body forcefully quivered. She lifted her head up just slightly, only to throw it back on the bed after feeling the burn in her abnormal muscles.</p><p align="left">“Do you think you can hold it for me?” Agatha queried with a wide smirk as she lifted her head up again and slid one finger inside without moving. Just there—trapped in Rio’s constantly convulsing walls.</p><p align="left">“N-no. No, I can't…” </p><p align="left">“Mhmm.” Agatha hummed as she resumed rubbing. Not even fully moving, just a ghost of a movement. Giving Rio the false hope—until her movements stopped all together and Rio’s eyes snapped open once she felt Agatha removing her legs away from her middle and gently placing them down on the bed. Then she lifted her glistening fingers up to her mouth that were dripping from Rio’s juices and deeply sucked them—all three fingers inside her mouth.</p><p align="left">“Wh—” Rio swallowed as she felt her eyes water because of how heart was pounding at how Agatha had denied her. “What… why?” she breathlessly wondered as she kept searching Agatha’s face with her half-lidded, teary eyes.</p><p align="left">“I want you to cum with me.” Agatha said after taking her fingers out of her mouth.</p><p align="left">“I was so close.” Rio whined, still hasn't regained her control over her senses.</p><p align="left">“I know.” Agatha leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to Rio’s knee before she lifted her hand up and cupped Rio’s face. Brushing the tears away from the edges of Rio’s eyes that haven't fallen down yet. Although her movements were gentle and tender, the look in her eyes was anything but.</p><p align="left">“We could’ve…” Rio exhaled deeply, not evening knowing what to say.</p><p align="left">“Yeah, I know.” Agatha said with a chuckle. “Now…” She gently loosened Rio’s grip on the sheets as if she was trying to pry a cat’s paws off a blanket. Then she took Rio’s hand by the wrist and guided it lower until Rio’s hand was on her own heat. “I want you to touch yourself for a few seconds… but don't cum. Just feel yourself, can you do that?” Agatha said, her tone laced with great amusement and delight—because she knew Rio couldn't last even if she wanted to.</p><p align="left">“I… I don't know. Fuck, I don't think I can…” Rio stammered as she felt her hand moving on herself by Agatha’s guidance.</p><p align="left">“Yes, you can, baby.” Agatha leaned her face closer to Rio’s, their mouths a heavy breath apart. “Hold it so you can cum inside me, hmm?”</p><p align="left">Rio’s body intensely quivered with force. She loudly moaned because Agatha’s words only worsened the situation in the most lascivious, pleasing way. Her words fucked Rio’s mind sideways.</p><p align="left">“I want to. Of course I want to cum inside you.” Rio swallowed down a whine.</p><p align="left">“Good, then control yourself for a few seconds.”</p><p align="left">Rio eagerly nodded.</p><p align="left">Agatha removed her hand with a smirk and gave Rio the lead over her body. Then she flickered Rio’s nipple causing her to cry out.</p><p align="left">Agatha got out of the bed with a chuckle. She approached the dresser and opened the second drawer. She took out the thick black toy and Rio heavily sighed while moving her middle finger on her clit, careful not to speed up or put more pressure that would cause her to lose all of her self-control.</p><p align="left">Her heart raced in her chest as she saw Agatha tucking a strand of her dark, messy hair behind her ear as she leaned lower to open another drawer and took the harness out. And god, how ravishing she looked at that moment—causing Rio’s mouth to water and her body to tremble.</p><p align="left">Agatha stood up straight again as she closed the drawer with her hip then she walked toward the bed again and Rio followed her with her eyes as her fingers stopped moving—she couldn't trust herself.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">And Rio’s heart dropped down and started pounding between her thighs.</p><p align="left">Rio harshly bit down on her bottom lip, as she, for a second, thought about switching and letting Agatha fuck her instead, until she would forget her name and who she was. To feel Agatha thrusting deep inside her, making her cum over and over <em>and</em> over again on her cock.</p><p align="left">The denied orgasm that was still hanging and intensely building up inside her. The way Agatha was looking at her while smirking knowingly with the thick toy in her hold—as if she knew exactly what Rio was thinking about—were all making Rio dizzy with lust and yearning. Not able to think about anything other than <em>release</em>. She was on the flight-or-fight mode while spinning in her place, intoxicated without a single drop of alcohol inside her body.</p><p align="left">Agatha licked her lips and Rio’s eyes drifted there. “Come here, pretty boy.” she said with <em>that</em> sultry voice. Her tone was laced with letch making Rio drip down pathetically.</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed hard as every hair on her body stood to an end. Then she got out of the bed and stood facing Agatha.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and pressed a kiss to her parted lips. “See? You can control yourself.” She murmured against Rio’s skin before she started kissing her way down, trailing her mouth while tenderly moving her filled hands on Rio’s skin, until Agatha was sitting on her knees on the floor in front of Rio.</p><p align="left">Rio looked down at Agatha who was looking up at her. Their chests were heavily rising and falling. Agatha smiled before she looked down and loosened the straps of the harness. With her hands busy, she blew air on a strand of hair that was falling on her eyes and annoying her.</p><p align="left">Rio fondly smiled then she lifted both of her hands up and </p><p align="left">tucked the few strands of hair that were falling down on Agatha’s face behind ears and she kept her hands there for a few seconds.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked up at her with a soft smile as she lowered the harness to the floor for Rio to step in.</p><p align="left">Then lifted it up along Rio’s legs until it was adjusted and the straps were centred over Rio’s hip bones. Afterward Agatha secured it around Rio’s waist and slipped one finger between Rio’s hip and the harness to check if it was secured properly and not uncomfortable. She tightened the straps around Rio’s butt, and lastly, she gave it a tug to check on it.</p><p align="left">“Good?”</p><p align="left">Rio swallowed hard as she kept looking at Agatha. Trying to figure out how her lover managed to make something as helping her wearing a harness look like something holy and out of this world? How all of her touches were tender even if they were heated? How everything she did was loving and devoted and made Rio’s heart race?</p><p align="left">Agatha looked up at her with loving eyes as she hummed in questioning, asking Rio to focus on her—little did she know that Rio was thinking about her even while she was with her.</p><p align="left">Rio hummed in affirmation as she looked down at Agatha, then she slipped her own finger to check on it and show Agatha with a slight nod.</p><p align="left">Agatha stood up. A soft smile graced her features as she faced Rio.</p><p align="left">Their eyes briefly met then Agatha pulled Rio a little closer to her by the straps, but there was still an inch of space between them.</p><p align="left">Rio exhaled a shaking breath through her nose as she looked down at Agatha attaching the toy to the O-ring and centering the base so it could be placed above Rio’s clit.</p><p align="left">Once Agatha was done securing it, she ran her hand along the length of the thick toy. Rio’s eyes stayed glued down at Agatha’s hand smoothly moving, then Agatha grabbed the toy tightly and pulled Rio toward her, closing the inch of space between them. Rio gasped as their bodies became flush against each other. Agatha slightly parted her thighs so the toy could slip between them and be directed right on her heat. Rio instinctively jerked her hips forward and they both moaned loudly then their sounds were suppressed and swallowed down once their eager, hungry mouths clashed in a heated, messy, lustful kiss. All tongues and teeth and saliva.</p><p align="left">The kiss immediately deepened as their tongues tangled. The sound of their mouths devouring one another were loud and obscene, heavily landing on their ears as their hearts rapidly pounded inside their chests.</p><p align="left">Rio placed both her hands on Agatha’s hips once she felt Agatha’s hands firmly grabbing her buttcheeks, almost lifting Rio up the floor.</p><p align="left">They pulled back slightly as they gasped for air. Their breaths heavily landing on their parted, swollen lips. </p><p align="left">Rio’s eyes drifted between Agatha’s eyes and lips as their chests rapidly rose and fell. </p><p align="left">Agatha jerked her hips forward as she leaned in, her chests flush against Rio’s. Her mouth was a breath away from Rio’s and her eyes were gleaming.</p><p align="left">“Come on, darling. Show me what you got.” Agatha murmured, the side of her lips curled up in an anticipated, delighted smirk. Her words were heavy and warm as they landed on Rio’s lips.</p><p align="left">Rio licked her lips and tightened her hold on Agatha’s hips as she looked straight into her eyes.</p><p align="left">She didn't respond verbally, Rio connected their mouths in another heated kiss as she walked Agatha by the hips until they were in front of the king-sized bed. Rio pulled back slightly and pushed Agatha to lie on her back on the bed.</p><p align="left">Agatha gasped as Rio hovered over her body.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">“<em>On your fours.</em>” Rio said the command with a low tone right on Agatha’s succulent, covetable lips.</p><p align="left">Agatha raised an eyebrow in delight as her pupils noticeably darkened and her chest heaved.</p><p align="left">“<em>Okay</em>.” She whispered and got away from Rio to sit in the center of the bed, right in front of the mirror, on her fours.</p><p align="left">Rio poked the inside of her cheek with the tip of her tongue as she kept looking at Agatha gracefully moving. Sitting on her hands and knees with her thighs parted. Her hair falling down by her sides. Her pale skin glistened with sweat. She looked perfect, hot and revishing.</p><p align="left">Agatha turned her face to the side and looked at Rio with dark eyes and her bottom lip between her teeth. Telling Rio that she was ready for her.</p><p align="left">Rio exhaled as she got on the bed. She pressed a few soft kisses on Agatha’s back, feeling her soft skin against her lips, until Rio was sitting on her knees behind Agatha.</p><p align="left">She deeply inhaled as she placed her hands on Agatha’s hips and Agatha’s scent filled her senses and made her head spin because of how intoxicating it was.</p><p align="left">Rio’s eyes were locked on her cunt and how good it looked like that as she felt her own cunt dripping down and clenching around nothing.</p><p align="left">“Should I get the lube… <em>oh</em>, fuck, never mind.” Rio said as she moved one of her hands and ran two of her fingers on Agatha’s slit.</p><p align="left">Agatha heavily moaned as she lifted her head up. And Rio felt how her walls convulsed at the slightest movement.</p><p align="left">“Bold of you to assume we would need lube.” She breathlessly said as she wiggled her ass, causing Rio’s heart to skip a beat.</p><p align="left">“Yeah.” Rio whispered, unable to raise her voice as she kept looking down in awe. She moved her hands up and placed them on Agatha’s butt then started brushing the soft skin. Shifting between softly brushing, firmly grabbing and digging her nails in the pale flesh. She didn't even know what she wanted to do. “<em>God, Agatha.</em>” Rio exhaled a shaking breath.</p><p align="left">“Look at the mirror.” </p><p align="left">Rio drifted her eyes up to the mirror. She almost forgot it was there. Forgot there was a lens—a reflection—mirroring everything that was happening between them and made her see with a different eye. A way to see, where she could be the giver and the observer.</p><p align="left">Her eyes lingered on herself for a few seconds. Taking in the state she was in. Then her eyes drifted to Agatha’s enchanting pair of blue eyes, and their eyes locked in their reflection. Their gazes searched each other’s reflected features.</p><p align="left">“Do you see how fucking good you look?” Agatha said. As if she was demanding Rio to acknowledge herself.</p><p align="left">Rio kept looking in front of her. Seeing how Agatha was sitting on her fours and she was sitting behind her on her heels. How Agatha’s breasts looked from that angle as they moved up and down or to the sides every time Agatha slightly moved. How her dark, messy hair was falling by her sides, curled down at the endings. Her glistening body and soft pale skin. And her hypnotizing eyes staring right at Rio without blinking.</p><p align="left">Then Rio looked up. At herself.</p><p align="left">She saw rather than looked.</p><p align="left">Her skin. Her face. Her body.</p><p align="left">She saw herself through a different lens.</p><p align="left">Not a different set of eyes, it was just a new angle.</p><p align="left">She traced her features. Noticed her expressions.</p><p align="left">She saw the details scattered all over her.</p><p align="left">Rio realized she was full of things to look at.</p><p align="left">Things she had never seen like that before that moment—never realized they were always there, waiting to be looked at. To be seen.</p><p align="left">She looked… <em>really fucking good.</em></p><p align="left">She felt oddly satisfied while looking at herself, even though she was naked. Her hair was a tangled mess and sticking on her sweating forehead. Her eyes were half-lidded and tired. Sweat glistened her flushed skin.</p><p align="left">That harness on her hips looked <em>good</em> on her. Her exposed breasts and hard nipples looked <em>good</em> on her. The desire written all over her face looked <em>good</em> on her. </p><p align="left">Rio looked <em>really fucking good</em> and she was able to admit that without feeling like she was cheating herself. Because the evidence was right in front of her eyes to see.</p><p align="left">“Hmmm?” Agatha’s soft hum broke the silence and brought Rio back to earth. As if she gently held Rio’s hand and guided her to come back and be with her.</p><p align="left">Rio blinked several times until her eyes landed on Agatha’s and their eyes met.</p><p align="left">She nodded slightly. “I do… I look good.” Rio whispered as she resumed moving her hands on Agatha’s skin.</p><p align="left">“You do, my love.”</p><p align="left">Rio hummed as her eyes drifted between Agatha’s face and her own. Then she lowered one of her hands down and started moving it on Agatha’s slit. Going up and down to collect her wetness.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuck me.</em>” Agatha moaned as she arched her back and lowered her head down while panting.</p><p align="left">“I will.” Rio said as she started moving her fingers that were smeared and glistening of Agatha’s juices up and down her cock. “Open wider for me.” She lifted her hips up and directed the head of the toy to rest on the leaking entrance.</p><p align="left">Agatha exhaled a shaking breath as she spread her thighs wider and Rio started slowly sliding inside her.</p><p align="left">They both breathlessly moaned as the sensations took over them.</p><p align="left">Rio was sinking deeper. Stretching at a slow, careful pace and thoroughly sliding more of the length of the toy every second while waiting for Agatha to adjust. Rio placed her hands on Agatha’s hips and started brushing her soft skin. Tenderly and spontaneously moving her fingers up and down and feeling Agatha’s body slightly trembling as she kept her eyes pinned down at how she was sliding inside with ease. Despite the size of the toy—Agatha was taking all of Rio in.</p><p align="left">“You look so beautiful like this.” Rio said with a low tone. Her voice dripped down in awe. “Utterly ready for me to take you.” She kept sinking slowly until the length of the toy slid all the way inside Agatha. Filling. And Rio could <em>feel</em> how Agatha’s walls clenched around her as she dug deep in and stretched her <em>deliciously</em>.</p><p align="left">“<em>Ahhh.</em>” Agatha heavily moaned as her body forcefully quivered. Her back arched even lower—her abdomen was almost touching the bed and lying flat on it as she tightly grabbed the sheets with both of her hands.</p><p align="left">“Oh, god. You feel… so good inside me, <em>ah</em>. Rio—<em>baby</em>, you're so big…” Agatha swallowed the rest of her words as she tightened her grip on the sheets once Rio started thrusting inside her. Slow and deep and felicitous.</p><p align="left">Rio held Agatha’s hips securely as she pumped in and out. Her body was slamming against Agatha’s with every thrust and the sounds of their bodies thudding while blending with their heavy breaths and lustful moans were dulcet to hear.</p><p align="left">“Fuck, look at me when you fuck me. Look at me, Rio.” Agatha heavily breathed out as she managed to lift her head up so she could look at their reflection.</p><p align="left">Rio met Agatha’s lustful, craving gaze.</p><p align="left">And the sight made her head whirl.</p><p align="left">She centered her weight on her pelvic as she picked up her pace and deeply thrusted. Feeling the moreish pressure on her clit with every thrust. </p><p align="left">Rio’s eyes kept drifting on their reflection, between Agatha’s face—how her mouth was wide open. Her eyebrows knitted. Her skin flushed. How she was fighting to keep her half-lidded, heavy eyes on Rio—and how her breasts were fetchingly bouncing. Her back arched. Her skin glistened.</p><p align="left">Rio was lost in Agatha’s bewildering, mind-bending maze and she didn't want to find an exit.</p><p align="left">Rio slowed down then she pulled out completely as she met Agatha’s gleaming eyes with her lips curled up in a smirk.</p><p align="left">She draped her arms on Agatha’s body so her palms could be placed on Agatha’s lower abdomen. Rio held her, feeling her scorching, sweating skin against her hands, after a heartbeat or two, she swiftly slid again. Thrusting her length in and filling Agatha up while feeling the burn in her own body that was only increasing and spreading. Making her starved for more and <em>more</em>.</p><p align="left">Agatha cried out Rio’s name with a high-pitched moan as her body shuddered forcefully. Her breaths were heavy, her hands were desperately grabbing the sheets as her knuckles turned white and her arms were barely standing stretched-out and holding her weight up.</p><p align="left">They were lustfully moaning in sync. And their ragged, heavy breaths were blending in their ears—swirling in the atmosphere.</p><p align="left">“Don't hold it.” Rio breathlessly said as she realized Agatha was weakly trying to control her orgasm. “Let go.”</p><p align="left">Rio lowered down one of her hands on Agatha’s skin. Moving on the c-section scar, lower to the pubic bone, touching the soaked, dark curled hair in her path until she found the throbbing clit. Rio started slowly rubbing it with her thumb as she felt the intense friction on her own with every thrust.</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh, fuck. Yes, god. There, Rio, there!</em>” Agatha’s moans became louder and louder. More desperate and yearning. “I'm so close, baby. Are you—<em>ah</em>—are you gonna cum with me?”</p><p align="left">Rio heavily moaned at how yearning and <em>seraphic</em> Agatha sounded. How desperate she was for them to cum together so they could melt and merge in their pleasure.</p><p align="left">Her honey-dripping voice made Rio’s heart rapidly pound in her chest and between her thighs. Her body trembled as if her whole being was attacked—by<em> a moan</em>. By<em> a woman</em>. Because, <em>O Almighty god</em> how she loved it when Agatha was that desperate for her even her voice chords couldn't hide it.</p><p align="left">“Yes,” Rio breathed out as she slightly lifted her body and directed her hips higher so she could apply more pressure to her clit—keenly wanting to cum with her lover. “I'm gonna cum with you.” Her calculated thrusts became frantic. Intended and needy.</p><p align="left">Rio stopped her movements on Agatha’s clit as she fixed her eyes on the mirror. Using the reflection to guide her hands on Agatha’s body.</p><p align="left">She didn't even know how she still had her focus to do something other than using her whole being to fuck Agatha and flood them both with pleasure—but the itch to touch and please Agatha fully was possessing her and piloting her to multi-task.</p><p align="left">So Rio leaned her body even closer as she continued thrusting at a quick speed. Her skin forcefully slamming against Agatha’s with every thrust.</p><p align="left">She lifted one of her hands up and moved it on Agatha’s soft, sweating back until she was able to gather Agatha’s wild hair and fist it. With a deep thrust she pulled her hair. Not rigidly, but tight enough to lift Agatha’s head up and make her look at their reflection.</p><p align="left">Agatha whimpered and her mouth was hanging wide open.</p><p align="left">Their eyes locked.</p><p align="left">Rio stared at their mirrored image. Although her vision was a little blurry, she knew what she was looking at—and what she was looking at was <em>maddening</em>.</p><p align="left">It was holy.</p><p align="left">A divine, otherworldly sight. </p><p align="left">And as if time had frozen at that moment just so Rio could see Agatha and notice her <em>sublimity</em>.</p><p align="left">Agatha with her dark hair pulled back and fisted in Rio’s hold. Her face was divinely shaped, her cheekbones were sharp and observable. Her sweating brow was frowned in anticipation and an awaited flood of pleasure. Her blue, glassy eyes that were barely managing to stay open were constantly blinking, Rio could even notice the soft kisses her eyelashes graced her skin with—and tears hung on the edges of her eyes because of the intensity of which her pleasure was building inside her. Her nose was tantalizing as always—that <em>immaculate</em> bone structure, sculpted by goddesses. Her swollen, plump lips were parted and saliva drooled from the edges of her mouth down to grace her chin—Rio wanted to lick it off with the length of her tongue and <em>relish</em> its warm, sweet taste. Her throat and neck were offered for Rio to admire and feel the satisfaction of her colored marks on Agatha’s body. Her perfect, bouncing breasts and hard, rosy nipples were a sight to kill for. Her arms were shakingly standing to hold her weight and the green veins darkened under her pale flesh. Her hands were vigorously grabbing the sheets and creating lines of wrinkles beyond ironing. Her back was arched, her abdomen almost lying flat on the bed. Her knees were digging in the sheets. Her pale skin was flushed and beautifully glistened with sweat—that Rio also wanted to lick off and <em>relish</em> its addictive saltiness, to roll her tongue and take in every drop of it.</p><p align="left">Agatha looked like… when the artist becomes the art.</p><p align="left">She looked like a masterpiece. A goddess. And a force of nature.</p><p align="left">The frozen time melted, and Rio was dripping down at the scene in front of her.</p><p align="left">At the way she was thrusting inside the love of her life and <em>unravel</em> her the way she asked Rio to.</p><p align="left">Listening to her heavy sighs. Loud moans. And desperate pleas for a release.</p><p align="left">A mutual one.</p><p align="left">Rio’s orgasm was intensely building up inside her—waiting for the right time to storm out.</p><p align="left">The blistering, luscious pressure on her clit, the way they both looked like in their reflection, and the headspace she was in, made Rio more aroused than any time she had ever been.</p><p align="left">She could feel it in her bones. Could feel the scorching pleasure in its way to flood her whole.</p><p align="left">And Rio knew Agatha was close, so close. She knew Agatha was feeling what she was feeling. The blazing infernos of pleasure were conflagrating them both.</p><p align="left">So she brought her hand lower and started rubbing the throbbing clit again with intention.</p><p align="left">To <em>unravel</em> Agatha.</p><p align="left">“<em>Fuckfuckfuck!</em>” Agatha breathlessly moaned as she involuntarily leaned her body back and met one of Rio’s frantic thrusts, the length of the toy went <em>deep</em> inside her. And Agatha cried out as if she was split wide open.</p><p align="left">Rio loosened her tight hold in Agatha’s hair, and as the dark, tangled strands fell down her sides, Rio moved her hand lower and placed it on Agatha’s butt and firmly grabbed the pale flesh. Noticing how it turned slightly red at the smallest touch.</p><p align="left">With more frantic, determined thrusts and rubs, the sounds of their scorching, sweating bodies slamming and their heavy moans got louder and louder. </p><p align="left">“Cum with me.” Rio breathlessly said.</p><p align="left">As the last thrust hit that spot inside, Agatha came while moaning Rio’s name out loud like it's salvation. She tightened her grip on the sheets, her muscles tensed as her orgasm tore through her and pleasure flooded her.</p><p align="left">Rio thrusted deeply one more time and she felt Agatha’s body forcefully shaking in her hold. She stopped the movements of her thumb rubbing on the swollen clit and lifted her eyes up to see. To take in the scene with a different lens. She looked at Agatha cumming in front of her in the mirror while she <em>felt</em> Agatha’s walls clenching around her length—and the holy sight made Rio follow Agatha in the bliss of pleasure and cum inside her after three seconds.</p><p align="left">Her movements completely stilled inside Agatha as she remained filling her up. Rio placed both of her hands on Agatha’s shaking body, and clanged onto her as her own body forcefully quivered and waves of scorching pleasure kept swirling inside her.</p><p align="left">Their eyes rolled in the back of their heads in ecstasy as they heavily sighed. Out of breath and shaking.</p><p align="left">Rio fell down on her knees and absentmindedly slid out of Agatha in one swift motion causing Agatha to curse out loud as her arms finally gave out and fell down followed by her knees.</p><p align="left">Their bodies crashed down on the bed panting and their bodies were still shaking.</p><p align="left">They lay opposite each other. Rio on her back with her hand placed above her heart and Agatha on her front with her arms stretched by her sides</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh my god.</em>” They gasped in unison. Their eyelids grew heavy and they closed their eyes shut, listening to their hearts rapidly pounding in their chests and loudly ringing in their ears.</p><p align="left">They stayed like that for a couple of minutes. Trying to come back from their high as they listened to their breaths getting steadier and steadier with every passing second.</p><p align="left">Rio regained some of her energy so she lifted her hips up to take off the harness. Her eyes lingered for a few seconds on the glistening toy filled with Agatha then she threw it to the side.</p><p align="left">Rio dragged her exhausted body until she was lying beside Agatha who rolled over to lay on her back with her eyes closed and her mouth open.</p><p align="left">Lying side by side in the middle of the bed. The atmosphere was thick with the smell of sex and sweat. The silence was loud with their sighs.</p><p align="left">Rio lay on her side and leaned even closer to hold Agatha’s body. She placed her hand around her waist and Agatha trembled from the slight contact.</p><p align="left">“Sorry.” Rio softly whispered and was about to take her hand away but Agatha stopped her by placing her own above Rio’s to keep it in place. </p><p align="left">Agatha opened her eyes and her blue irises met Rio’s brown ones and adoringly swirled with it. </p><p align="left">Their eyes were half-lidded and the bliss of their desire and love to each other was visible in their gaze as they stared into each other’s eyes. Feeling the sereneness and devotion.</p><p align="left">Agatha feebly lifted her hand up and cupped Rio’s face, her thumb tenderly brushing the soft skin.</p><p align="left">Their soft, spent smiles reflected.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned her face in and pressed a kiss between Rio’s eyebrows. She wasn't quite able to lift her body up and reach her forehead—and the kiss was more like a gentle contact of her soft lips with Rio’s skin. </p><p align="left">Their eyes met again as their smiles widened.</p><p align="left">“Thank you.” Rio softly spoke. “For trusting me. For all of it, really.” Her heart was peacefully beating inside her chest, in synchronicity with Agatha’s warm breaths that were gingerly landing on her face. </p><p align="left">Rio felt safe in Agatha’s close proximity.</p><p align="left">She was placid. Blessed.</p><p align="left">She felt good <em>in</em> her body.</p><p align="left">She was capable of feeling herself in that moment and to <em>feel</em> what she was feeling.</p><p align="left">As if something finally became clear all of a sudden—Rio felt like a morning after a stormy night. The clouds sailed away as the sun shined and graced the earth with its warmth.</p><p align="left">Looking at Agatha’s alluring face while tracing her features with her eyes and memorizing them, it gave Rio a sense of inner peace that showed on her even from the outside. </p><p align="left">“Rio.” Agatha whispered. Spelling her name like it was deliverance. Tasting the syllabus in her mouth with great delight. “<em>Oh</em>, <em>Rio</em>.” Breathing Rio’s name out in amorousness and devotion. Agatha inhaled deeply as she continued brushing Rio’s skin with delicacy. “God, you're so tender… so goddamn perfect. I love you.” Agatha said as she slowly moved her hand lower.</p><p align="left">“I love you too.” Rio started brushing Agatha’s skin. Gently drawing messy patterns on her hip bone.</p><p align="left">Agatha placed her hand on Rio’s chest above her beating heart and they both inhaled deeply, sharing the same air. Then exhaled softly and warmly on each other’s faces.</p><p align="left">Rio traced Agatha’s features with her eyes while they continued inhaling and exhaling deeply. Their chests rose and fell in sync as their hearts beat attentively.</p><p align="left">A couple serene minutes of organizing their breathing together had passed. They shared a ritual and led each other through every draw in and a let out. Filled their senses with each other’s scent as they deeply felt the warmth for their bodies being so close. They were so present at that moment, when they delicately guided one another to calm their whole beings with each other’s presence. </p><p align="left">Fingertips soothingly brushed and eyes adoringly traced.</p><p align="left">“We should take a shower.” Rio softly suggested as she trailed her hand lower and placed it on Agatha’s abdomen.</p><p align="left">“Mhm.” Agatha hummed as she gently palmed the skin of Rio’s chest above her heart. “Maybe a bath? I don't think I can stand up just yet.”</p><p align="left">Rio widely smiled in amusement.</p><p align="left">“Oh, <em>who</em> did that to you?”</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled. “You, sorceress.” She leaned in and pressed a kiss to Rio’s upper lip as she moved her hand lower and wrapped it around Rio’s waist to pull her even closer to her. </p><p align="left">Their fronts were flush against each other and their eyes were locked in an adoring gaze.</p><p align="left">They lingered in that moment of peacefulness for a couple of minutes. Wrapped in the warmth of their bodies and surrounded by their love to one another.</p><p align="left">They lay there in the middle of the bed in intimacy. Pressing soft kisses, sharing confessions, whispering sweet nothings while embracing each other passionately.</p><p align="left">Rio energetically got up with the neurochemicals running in her system after she pressed deep and affectionate kisses all over Agatha’s face and cleavage. Trailing her nose and soft lips on Agatha’s skin. Feeling and inhaling her in, she couldn't get enough of Agatha.</p><p align="left">“I will prepare the bath for us, my love.” Rio said with a low tone as she leaned her head in and kissed Agatha’s hip then brushed her skin with the tip of her nose.</p><p align="left">Agatha softly hummed with her eyes closed and her chest rising and falling steadily. Her arm was stretched to the side, moving her fingertips in feather-like motions on Rio’s knee— almost tickling, causing Rio to smile.</p><p align="left">Rio crawled her way on the bed and collected her thrown clothes and harness, then went to the bathroom to wash the toy and freshen up.</p><p align="left">After she adjusted the temperature, Rio was bending down with her hand in the bathtub. Moving her fingers slowly left and right, seeing the faint vapor sailing up to the ceiling, as she listened to the warm water pouring down in the tub and filling it up</p><p align="left">Rio stood up and lit a few floral-scented candles and set them nearby to create an atmosphere that would placate them, while also giving Agatha more time to rest on the bed.</p><p align="left">When she got out and was on her way to the bedroom, Agatha was already on her feet heading to the bathroom. </p><p align="left">Walking bare, from head to toe, gracing the earth with every step she took. Her dark hair was cascading behind her back, making her face look <em>luminous</em>.</p><p align="left">The way she looked under the dim lighting of the hallway? How it spilled on her perfectly, contouring her curves and features and making Rio’s heart flutter in her chest?</p><p align="left">Agatha looked <em>ethereal</em>. Standing gracefully with that sense of serenity her presence held.</p><p align="left">“<em>Hey there, gorgeous.</em>” Rio softly spoke as she took two steps forward and approached Agatha. She placed her hands on Agatha’s hips while her thumbs brushed the soft skin of her back.</p><p align="left">Their gleaming eyes met as their pupils dilated and their adulating smiles reflected.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned in and connected their mouths in a tender kiss. Their lips and tongues moving slowly and deeply without a rush. Tasting, savoring and feeling each other.</p><p align="left">Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s neck and they slightly pulled back. The string of saliva that was gleaming in the dim lighting connected their lips as they locked their eyes on one another.</p><p align="left">They stepped into the bathroom and Rio helped Agatha get into the warm water. Rio pressed a kiss to her hair then she stood up to get the loofah. She sat on her knees on the bathroom tile and started gently scrubbing Agatha’s skin.</p><p align="left">“Get in.” Agatha spoke as she looked at Rio’s face focused on her task. Agatha’s voice was warm and soft, it was healing.</p><p align="left">“I will—I just want to help clean you up. I want you to relax.” Rio met Agatha’s eyes as she began scrubbing her shoulders.</p><p align="left">“We can do that together at the same time, my love. Come here.” Agatha placed her hand on Rio’s arm and gently made her remove her hand away from Agatha’s shoulder. Then Agatha held Rio’s palm in hers as she looked at Rio’s eyes, telling her to get up.</p><p align="left">And Rio did. She stood on her feet then stepped into the warm water and sat behind Agatha, wrapping her arms around her middle.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s back was flush against Rio’s front, it was peaceful.</p><p align="left">“That's better.” Agatha softly whispered as she closed her eyes and let her muscles loose as she sank deeper in the bathtub. She gladly sighed and placed her hands above Rio’s that were placed on her abdomen and started brushing the sides of Rio’s hands with her thumbs.</p><p align="left">After they cleansed themselves and one another with gentle, considerate movements. Delicately scrubbed their skin as they felt the warmth of their bodies and the water they were sitting in. Their fingertips ran soothingly as their soft lips trailed down their wet skin and pressed tender kisses in every spot they could reach.</p><p align="left">They both sat in the warm water. Rio’s back was resting against the white acrylic. Her arms wrapped around her lover’s wet middle as her legs were bent up on both sides of Agatha—who was sitting between Rio’s slightly stretched thighs. Her back was flush against Rio’s front, soaked and warm. Her legs stretched 'til the end of the bathtub and her fingers gently brushing the inside of Rio’s thighs under the water.</p><p align="left">Rio tightened her hold on Agatha’s body as she exhaled a breath on Agatha’s hair that sounded more like a relieved sigh. </p><p align="left">Rio was glad and at peace.</p><p align="left">She felt secure while holding Agatha.</p><p align="left">She was <em>there</em>. At that moment. <em>Present</em> in her lover’s embrace. Feeling Agatha’s body on hers as she listened to her heart beat with love in her chest.</p><p align="left">Rio gently moved her hand up and trailed her fingertips on Agatha’s skin. She gathered Agatha’s dark hair and put it on the side to fall on Agatha’s shoulder down to her chest. Only the ends of her hair were wet and they tickled her skin once they fell down.</p><p align="left">Rio tenderly started kissing the back of Agatha’s neck. Slowly trailing down with her soft lips on Agatha’s skin while pressing soft kisses, until she reached Agatha’s shoulders and started kissing them gracefully while feeling the heat of Agatha’s skin against her lips. Listening to her soft whimpers and mellow moans—a delightful melody blessing Rio’s whole being, making shivers run down her spine.</p><p align="left">She put her hands on Agatha’s shoulders and started delicately massaging the muscles that were still a little tense. Rubbing with her thumbs on her shoulder blades. </p><p align="left">Agatha bent one of her knees up as she moaned into the atmosphere in satisfaction and contentment. Rio felt Agatha’s muscles loosen under her touch and her body melting.</p><p align="left">“Keep doing that and I'll be sleeping here tonight.” Agatha whispered with her eyes closed and her fingers continued to softly brush Rio’s thighs.</p><p align="left">Agatha mellowly sighed. Savoring the sensations while feeling Rio’s delicate fingers running on her skin and soothing.</p><p align="left">“I will carry you.” Rio whispered into her ear and Agatha whimpered as she leaned back even more against Rio’s body. </p><p align="left">Then she slightly turned her head to her side. To Rio.</p><p align="left">And their hooded eyes locked. Staring at each other lovingly.</p><p align="left">Faint vapor hung in the atmosphere between them, sailing at the ceiling. Their scent mixed with the candles’ and filled their senses. </p><p align="left">They looked gratified. Their features were rested, and their bodies were flushed from the warmth of the water and their close proximity.</p><p align="left">Agatha leaned her face in and pressed a kiss to Rio’s chin, then up, another one to her lips. And up, to the tip of her nose. </p><p align="left">Agatha moved her legs and turned her body to the side so she could be lying on Rio’s front. The sound of the water moving and splashing because of Agatha’s movements was loud between them, until it stilled again once Agatha found the position she wanted. Lying on her side on Rio’s body, her legs stretched in the water and her head was on Rio’s shoulder—looking at Rio with love. Gazing at her with those mesmerising blue eyes.</p><p align="left">“Rio.” Agatha affectionately said Rio’s name as she pressed a soft kiss to her shoulder.</p><p align="left">She said it just because she had the desire to do so. Because Agatha could say Rio’s name and taste it in her mouth whenever she wanted to. And Rio’s heart raced inside her chest whenever Agatha said her name.</p><p align="left">“<em>My</em> Rio.” Agatha smiled as she leaned in and pressed another warm kiss to Rio’s lips. Her lips were tender on Rio’s.</p><p align="left">“<em>Your</em> Rio.”</p><p align="left">Rio wrapped her arm around Agatha’s middle and pulled her closer to her as she leaned her face in, connecting their mouths in a kiss. Their lips melded as they kissed lazily. Warmly. Not having the energy for a devouring kiss, but they kissed deeply nonetheless. Just wanted to feel their mouths fully on one another. The desire to taste the sweetness lingering inside and take it in. Tangling their tongues messily. Slowly, adoringly and without a pattern.</p><p align="left">After a few more doting kisses and devoted fingertips running on each other’s skin. The minutes passed as they held one another in a warming embrace. Feeling the water becoming colder as they sunk in each other’s presence. </p><p align="left">They dried out, moving the white towels on their dripping bodies as their eyes met every second—and every time they did, their lips curled up in a soft smile.</p><p align="left">They did their nightly routine, wrapped in sereness and warming domesticity. Making their hearts beat in so much love inside their chests.</p><p align="left">They shared glances in the mirror as they brushed their teeth—grinning with their toothbrushes inside their mouths. Kissing and tasting the synthetic mint that lingered in their mouths after. Touching each other’s bodies with delicate and soothing fingertips.</p><p align="left">It felt like love.</p><p align="left">It was love.</p><hr/><p align="left">They lay in bed. Naked while embracing each other tightly. Rio’s head was resting on Agatha’s chest, feeling her head rising and falling steadily with Agatha’s chest.</p><p align="left">Listening to the rhythm of her heartbeat with her eyes closed, one hand wrapped around Agatha’s middle and the other one moving slowly on her soft skin—drawing messy, tranquilizing patterns.</p><p align="left">Rio remembered the song she heard Agatha humming the other day when she was making dinner. Rio lingered on the stairs just so she could hear that soft, melodic hum coming out of Agatha’s throat. It stuck in her head since that day. Rio didn't recognize what song it was and forgot to ask Agatha about it but it affected her nonetheless. The softness in those hums soothed her.</p><p align="left">“What was that song you were humming the other day?” Rio whispered.</p><p align="left">“Hmm? Which one?”</p><p align="left">“I don't know its name. You were humming it, it was beautiful.”</p><p align="left">“Rio, I can't recognize songs that way.” Agatha chuckled.</p><p align="left">Rio opened her eyes and looked at Agatha with a slight pout, even though Agatha couldn't see her because her eyes were closed.</p><p align="left">“Okay, I will… try to hum it the way I heard it, but don't laugh at me.” Rio said as she saw the way Agatha’s lips curled up in a smile.</p><p align="left">“Okay, I won't.”</p><p align="left">Rio started softly humming as she kept her locked eyes on Agatha’s face. Trying to replicate what she heard that day, while feeling Agatha’s fingers running in her hair. She was doing her best not to mess it up so Agatha could recognize it.</p><p align="left">Once Rio finished, she spoke: “So? Do you recognize it?”</p><p align="left">Agatha exhaled a warm breath. “Hum it again.”</p><p align="left">And Rio did.</p><p align="left">“God, how I love your voice.” Agatha sighed as she briefly opened her eyes.</p><p align="left">Their eyes met.</p><p align="left">“Recognize it?” Rio asked with anticipated, gleaming eyes.</p><p align="left">Agatha nodded. </p><p align="left">“I think it's <em>On the Sea</em> by Beach House.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh</em>. Okay.” Rio put her head back on Agatha’s chest as she tightened her hold around her middle. She closed her eyes as a shiver ran down her spine once Agatha gently started massaging her scalp. Making her body tremble because of the soporific sensations she was feeling.</p><p align="left">“Sing it for me.” Rio whispered.</p><p align="left">“Hmm?”</p><p align="left">“I've never heard you singing.”</p><p align="left">“I—I don't sing. I can't.” Agatha responded. Her voice was laced with hesitation.</p><p align="left">“Why? I think you have an euphonic voice.” Rio softly and sincerely admitted. Because Agatha indeed had a <em>euphonic</em> voice.</p><p align="left">Agatha’s movements stilled in Rio’s hair. And Rio felt how deep she inhaled.</p><p align="left">“I used to sing a lot, but since Nicky died… I kind of lost my singing voice? If you can call it that… I really don't know. I can hum to tones from time to time, I don't face any problem with that… it's the singing out loud part—I can't seem to do it.” she paused and exhaled a shaking breath.</p><p align="left">Rio’s heart pounded in her chest as she tightened her hold.</p><p align="left">“A few years ago, when I brought it up to my therapist, she said it's because of a psychological trauma. You know, because I used to sing with him all the time, and the last thing we were doing together was… singing.” Agatha paused again as her hands resumed brushing Rio’s hair.</p><p align="left">“I thought this could only happen to singers—people who their whole life depended on performing and singing. But I think I found too much joy in doing that with him when he was with me, so his death affected even that part of me—my voice.” Her movements stilled again. Then Agatha moved her arm lower by her side so she could brush Rio’s back with her fingers. “And well, that's why you don't hear me sing, my love.”</p><p align="left">A chilling shiver ran down Rio’s spine and crept inside her.</p><p align="left">She lifted her head up to look at Agatha. She wanted to see her eyes, but Agatha’s eyes were closed and Rio didn't dare tell her to open them—so she traced her features with her eyes instead as her heart pounded in her chest.</p><p align="left">“I'm sorry.” Rio whispered.</p><p align="left">“Don't be, baby. Don't be sorry. And… you don't have to say anything. You know, things—they… happen.” a sharp exhale. “I learned the hard way not to dwell in the past. I need to be present.” She licked her lips. “For some reason, every time I remember that I can't sing, I remember <em>The Canary</em> by Katherine Mansfield.” Agatha smiled. “It seems kind of absurd… but I do.” </p><p align="left">Agatha started moving her hand up and down Rio’s spine while Rio kept looking at Agatha’s face, tracing her features.</p><p align="left">She didn't know what to say, or how to say it—so Rio just <em>looked</em> as silence started stretching between them.</p><p align="left">Agatha softly exhaled a warm breath as she put her hand on Rio’s head and gently pushed her down so Rio would be resting on her chest again.</p><p align="left">“You have such a beautiful voice though. It's healing, really. I think you should sing for me more often.”</p><p align="left">Rio smiled.</p><p align="left">Then her stomach loudly rumbled. She ignored it and opened her mouth, about to speak, then it rumbled again and she felt Agatha’s body shake from a giggle.</p><p align="left">“I told you to eat your food, didn't I?”</p><p align="left">Rio looked up with a slight pout at Agatha—who was smiling with her eyes still closed.</p><p align="left">“Well, I wasn't hungry at the time.”</p><p align="left">“And now you are?”</p><p align="left">“Yes.”</p><p align="left">“Wait… I'm getting a déjà vu moment.” Agatha opened her eyes to meet Rio’s as she pointed her finger toward the air with her lips curled up in an even wider, amused smile. “Oh yeah, this has happened before. <em>So</em> many times.”</p><p align="left">Agatha chuckled as she cupped Rio’s face—who was nuzzling her chin gently against Agatha’s skin so she could look up at her.</p><p align="left">“In my defense…” Rio started, the smile visible in her features, she couldn't hide it—not when Agatha was smiling that bright, delighted smile of hers and looking at Rio like she was the most precious thing in the world. “Nothing tastes as good as your cooking. <em>You</em> spoiled me and made me get used to it.” Rio pointed her accusing finger at Agatha.</p><p align="left">“And it's my pleasure to cook for you and spoil you, my love.” Agatha moved her index finger on Rio’s face. Slowly and delicately tracing Rio’s nose until it rested on the tip. “What time is it?”</p><p align="left">“I think it's just past eleven.”</p><p align="left">“Okay, let's feed you.”</p><p align="left">They put on some t-shirts and shorts while stealing a few kisses and touches mid-act.</p><p align="left">They couldn't keep their hands or mouths to themselves. They <em>needed</em> to touch and kiss each other.</p><p align="left">Then they went down stairs. Straight to the kitchen to silence Rio’s rumbling stomach up.</p><p align="left">Agatha began preparing the ingredients she needed to make them some pasta—upon Rio’s request after she said she was hungry but her stomach cannot take anything heavy at the moment. Agatha sure had pursed her lips and narrowed her eyes at Rio for a few seconds, but she couldn't resist how goddamn adorable Rio looked. So Agatha leaned in and pressed a soft kiss on the cheek of a smiling Rio.</p><p align="left">Rio on the other hand, prepared the table for them then she went to tidy up the living room. She picked up the abandoned cans and bowls from the coffee table and Agatha’s jacket that she forgot to pick up earlier. Then she reached the remote.</p><p align="left">Rio looked at it for a few long seconds. Her eyes were glued down, staring at the red power button as if she had something personal with it.</p><p align="left">Then her eyes drifted up to the turned-off TV, where she could see her standing reflection in the black mirror. </p><p align="left">She clenched Agatha’s jacket in her hand, hesitant. Her finger was noticeably shaking as she pressed the red button. </p><p align="left">The screen turned blue and it was eye-blinding, so Rio immediately pressed the rewind button and after a few seconds, her footage filled the screen.</p><p align="left">Rio set the cans and bowls on the coffee table again. She sat down on the couch as she lowered the volume and put Agatha’s jacket on her lap. It had her intoxicating, comforting scent.</p><p align="left">The video started playing and Rio kept looking at every movement on the screen. Every detail. Remembering the feelings she felt when she recorded the tape the other night while seeing it right in front of her eyes.</p><p align="left">It looked different because it was from a different angle. A different lens and perspective.</p><p align="left">Because that wasn't what Rio saw when she was recording it, because she couldn't see herself even if the mirror was there. When the camera was recording and directed at her, Rio looked around the room. Stared at the ceiling and noticed the objects but not herself.</p><p align="left">Yes, it looked different.</p><p align="left">But it felt the same. </p><p align="left">Because the angle and the perspective were different, she couldn't feel what it actually felt earlier, she just saw and was terrified by watching something she knew through a lens that wasn't her eyes.</p><p align="left">Rio paused the video to stare at her facial expressions. Taking herself in. Remembering what that exact second felt like when she was present in it. Then resumed it again only to pause it a couple of seconds later to <em>observe</em>. To recognize.</p><p align="left">She saw her lips moving and her eyes working on her body.</p><p align="left">She heard herself murmuring things that weren’t coherent because of the low volume.</p><p align="left">The footage continued playing and her eyes were fixed on the screen. Looking at herself bare and her fingers slowly moving on her skin.</p><p align="left">Rio kept hearing that voice inside her head commenting.</p><p align="left">Her head was flooded with thoughts while she was sitting down and seeing what she looked like.</p><p align="left">She looked like herself—whatever oneself meant. It's felt.</p><p align="left">The image she was seeing didn't look that different from what she saw in her reflection in the mirror.</p><p align="left">Her eyes were locked on the screen.</p><p align="left"><em>Was it glowing?</em></p><p align="left">Rio heard footsteps approaching the living room, but for some reason, she couldn't look away from the screen. She wanted to see what was going to happen, what she was going to do. Even though she was the one who did it. Even if she had watched the video three times—because it felt like she was watching something else entirely. Noticing details she didn't notice before as if they had magically appeared.</p><p align="left">A step.</p><p align="left">The video ended and the screen was blue again.</p><p align="left">A step.</p><p align="left">Rio’s finger was resting on the power button. She turned her face to the side, the moment she pressed the button, her eyes met Agatha’s and the screen cut to black.</p>

<p>Chapter End Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Holy shit, it has been a hell of a week!<br/>Four weeks to be precise. Actually... five weeks and a few days. But well anyway, who's counting? (me and you and a whole nation apparently.)</p>
<p>But really, in my defense, this chapter wasn't planned at all. It was supposed to be their trip to Paris but I got stuck mid writing and I couldn't write one of the simplest scenes ever, so I had to come up with something, and that's how this chapter was born. (come on twenty-one, say hi!)</p>
<p>Also I have another WIP that I'm currently working on, that if I'm not writing it, then I'm thinking about it.</p>
<p>Also, it's 45°C+ where I live, so if my head isn't melting then my fingers are, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought about spillting this chapter into two when I realized how long it was, but I decided to keep it that way. It's good in its length and I really love this chapter because I literally poured myself and my time into writing it. (I only edited this once because I wanted to update, so I might edit a few things later. In the meantime, ignore the mistakes.)</p>
<p>So, enough yapping.<br/>I hope you enjoyed reading this chapter the way I enjoyed writing it.</p>
<p>Your comments and kudos are always welcomed and appreciated, they make my days.</p></blockquote>
