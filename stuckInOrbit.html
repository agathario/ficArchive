<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was 11:45am.</p><p>And it was cold as <i>fuck</i> outside.</p><p>Agatha Harkness released a disgruntled sigh as she hastily threw a knit scarf around her neck, tugging tighter at the navy duffle coat that hung around her frame. Her eyes hadn't left the view of the insistent cascade of snow that was dropping from the sky.</p><p>She had two options: She could call a cab and undoubtedly be late to her own 12:30 lecture, which her students would surely never let her hear the end of. Or, she could simply take that stupid bike which would probably get her there in substantially less time, taking for granted that the snow didn't start falling any harder.</p><p>It had taken her all of two months to learn every shortcut from her townhome in Avon Hill to her lecture hall, and in the nearly two years since, she absolutely hated every time she had to use them. Clearly, a warm car was the better option, but for the sake of being punctual, she knew that the bike was going to be her quickest one.</p><p>But gods be damned if she didn't hate that fucking thing.</p><p>Begrudgingly, she reached down and fastened the front of her coat before she let herself out the front door and locked it behind her. Nearly dragging her feet as she made her way down the stairs, Agatha turned the corner to see the bicycle propped against the building. She heaved a sigh and reached forward, dusting away the light bit of powder that had accumulated on the seat and handlebars.</p><p>Another annoyed huff shot out through parted lips as she heaved herself onto the bike and began to pedal, thankful that the roads weren't quite slick yet.</p><p>Today really wasn't the day for this; she had almost considered, for a brief moment, that she should have called a substitute, that she should have just taken the day to herself.</p><p>It had been fifteen years, but the sharp stab of pain that ripped through Agatha's chest every year when she realized it was November 16th still was enough to choke her, to make her forget coherent thought, even for a few moments.</p><p>Every year, she'd lay on that bed, eyes fixed on the ceiling as her finger traced over the pendant she wore every minute of every day. She'd try to find his face in the shadows that were cast on the ceiling, or hear his laughter in the wind that blew through the cracked window. Every year, she was met with disappointment.</p><p>Somehow, every year, she missed Nicky even more.</p><p>For fifteen years, she'd been on the move. She had lived in more than a handful of cities for at minimum six to eight months, and then she would pack her things and move on.</p><p>Agatha was on the run. Or, at least, she had been.</p><p>After years in Paris, Budapest, Reykjavik, Amsterdam, Nairobi, Belize and too many others to name, she'd learned a lot in her time. It seemed to help that she was a quick learner, that she didn't need much direction when it came to knowing what to do. Agatha was many things, but the thing she had learned to be most was to be sure of herself.</p><p>In her nomadic state, there had been so much to learn, so much to see.</p><p>Although she hated to admit it for fear that it might make her appear softer than she wanted people to think she was, Paris had been her favorite. She'd gone back twice more after her original visit, staying roughly six months each time. By the time she'd left her third time? Agatha had developed a decent handle on the French language, enough that she sometimes caught herself swearing in French without meaning to. That wasn't even a thing, was it?</p><p>Of course she'd developed a looser grip on some of the other languages she had cared to learn in her time travelling, but French had been her favorite. There was something so nuanced about it, something that just <i>felt right</i> when she heard herself speak it.</p><p>And then, two years ago, Agatha realized she had to stop running. It was getting her nowhere, and if anything, no matter how many miles she traveled, the one thing she was running away from was the one thing she couldn't get away from.</p><p>She was running from herself.</p><p>So, she'd purchased a town home in a quiet Boston neighborhood and had given herself a timeline of at least five years. If she tried to put down roots and nothing seemed to take? Well, she would at least be able to say that she tried.</p><p>So far, she'd made it two years in, which was undoubtedly the longest stretch she had made since she had lost her son.</p><p>While she had found a way to wake up most days and carry her head high, the 16th always seemed to carry with it this somber sense of painful memories that weighed her down each and every year. Agatha wished she could get over it, that she could somehow just shove it back, kick it to the farthest corners of the basement of her own mind and forget it was even there.</p><p>No, that wasn't fair to Nicky.</p><p>A chill ran up Agatha's spine, though she wasn't sure if it was from the twenty-five degrees or what had been running through her head at the time.</p><p>She realized -- in a moment that left her even more disgruntled -- that she had not put on a hat, and as a result, her ears were burning because they were so cold. Letting go of one of the handle bars, she reached up to try and adjust her scarf for some form of relief, but it was of little use, only seeming to irritate her further.</p><p>This was just one fan-fucking-tastic day, wasn't it?</p><p>Agatha's body tilted to the side as she came toward the lip of an alley, turning to cut down into it. This one, she knew, would shave about three minutes off as opposed to going the long way.</p><p>Another lean, another turn.</p><p>As she approached the stop light, blue eyes flickered up to see that she had the right-of-way and she kept going, peddling a little harder to make the turn.</p><p>What she had not been able to see beyond the cars in front and to her left was that someone was making a left turn from opposing traffic.</p><p>She heard the horn, her head jerking up, but it was too late.</p><p>On one of the worst days of her life, Agatha Harkness had to go and get hit by a fucking car.</p><p>*****</p><p>Somewhere in the middle of pitch black, Agatha had a dream. She had a dream that there was a woman, a beautiful woman, touching her face, her arms. There had been a brief flash of light, and then straight back into blackness.</p><p>Something in Agatha stirred, but her eyes did not open; she did not want them to open.</p><p>If she opened them, the absolutely thundering and loud pulsing in her head was only going to get worse -- of that she was sure.</p><p>With a soft groan, she raised her hand, feeling the pull and pinch of the IV that had been placed into her arm. Her eyes had flown open at the sensation, but the regret was immediate. She lurched, leaning over the side of the bed, thankful to see that someone had been of sound enough mind to place a trash can at her bedside.</p><p>She wretched, each heave sending a strike of a sledgehammer to the back of her skull. Each gagged sound made her only gag more; Christ, was she really doing this now?</p><p>Finally, her body stilled and there was nothing left over from the granola bar she'd eaten that morning that could possibly make that happen again.</p><p>She leaned back against the pillows again, her eyes falling shut.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>She wasn't at home.</p><p>Her eyes opened again, a soft whimper of pain passing between her lips.</p><p>As she had managed to bring the room into focus, though, there was suddenly a woman at her bedside.</p><p>Her eyes swept up, another wave of nausea fighting to take her over, but she somehow choked it back.</p><p>All she saw was her face.</p><p>That was a beautiful face.</p><p>It was so similar to the one in her dream.</p><p>Her features were soft, her eyes the prettiest color, striking something in Agatha's middle as familiar. Her skin was toned and she had the sweetest pink across her cheeks, her smile so warm and inviting. Her dark hair was pulled tightly toward the back of her head and there was very noticeably a pen -- with the end chewed -- sticking out of the bun.</p><p>"Hey there," the woman cooed sweetly at her, tilting her head. That smile. That was a really, <i>really</i> nice smile.</p><p>Agatha blinked, trying to understand what was happening and who this woman was. The way she was looking at her? It was what spurred Agatha's first words, a soft display of her disorientation.</p><p>"Are... you... are you my girlfriend?" she asked, a little shocked by how unsteady her own voice sounded.</p><p>That smile? It broke out into a grin, but the woman shook her head softly.</p><p>"No, no. I'm Doctor Vidal, I'm the ER attending. The ambulance brought you in after you were struck by a vehicle. The EMT did inform me that there is no hope for the bicycle, and that he's sorry."</p><p>Even though Agatha knew she should have been paying attention to the words the woman was saying, she couldn't help but focus on the sound of her voice instead. It was so nice, so rich in its soft deepness. It was also tinged slightly with... what was that accent? Maybe even an entirely coherent Agatha might not even have been able to place it.</p><p>Agatha was trying to force herself to focus, but when she looked at those eyes? She was almost certain she had never seen a pair of eyes quite so beautiful in all of her travels.</p><p>Agatha's lips turned down at the corners as the first part of what the woman had said finally seemed to process.</p><p>Her brow furrowed, the smallest wrinkles forming across the expanse of her forehead.</p><p>"You're... my doctor?" Agatha asked, her eyes narrowing slightly. That couldn't be right. How was a woman that looked like <i>that</i> a doctor? Okay, so maybe that was a little superficial, even in her haze.</p><p>"I..." her lips twisted in disappointment. "I... I saw you, in a dream," she mumbled. "I thought you were my girlfriend."</p><p>"I did come in about an hour ago, but sorry to disappoint," she voiced, and Agatha's hardly coherent brain was quick to react.</p><p>"Oh..." she let out in a breath, but her lips were twisting again as she looked back to the doctor. "Well... can I at least have your number?"</p><p>At this, the doctor laughed softly.</p><p>"Can't do that, I'm afraid," she responded, but there was a follow-up that had been entirely unnecessary. "If it were under any other circumstances..."</p><p>The doctor seemed to catch herself, as if realizing she had let slip something that was meant to stay up top. Her cheeks were almost... red? Was she blushing?</p><p>She cleared her throat, her expression smoothing out. Back to business.</p><p>"You've been in and out of consciousness, which had us a little worried. We did get you in for a CT and we didn't see much bruising, and there's no bleeding on your brain, but you do have a pretty severe concussion." The doctor's tone had slipped from something that had started as informative, but it faded into something a little warmer by the time she had finished speaking. "If you're not opposed, we would like to keep you overnight for observation."</p><p>Agatha had heard her, but her rattled mind was circling on one thing.</p><p>"It's because I'm a patient, right?" Agatha asked, to which Doctor Vidal blinked at her, not realizing that Agatha had not really progressed in the conversation. "That's why you can't give me your number?"</p><p>Another smooth but rather kind smile slid across the doctor's lips, another soft laugh hitting the air around them.</p><p>"Yes, because you're a patient. And I could get in <i>very</i> big trouble for that."</p><p>The dissatisfaction was immediate on Agatha's face. She didn't like that. She just wanted to hear this beautiful woman talk more. It made her feel a little warm in her chest, somewhere that usually felt so cold.</p><p>Agatha tried to move, but she winced at the pain she felt in her side.</p><p>"What even happened to me?" she asked, her voice sour at the way she felt so... weak.</p><p>"You were making a right turn on your bicycle and someone in an SUV was making a left turn at the same time. You've got some lacerations, but nothing that needed stitches. Your ribs, while not broken, are going to be sore for a while." The doctor seemed to study her, observing her, taking her in.</p><p>"Do you have any objections to us keeping you?"</p><p>Agatha blinked. She'd already missed her class, and the sun had already set. She'd have to email in for a sub at some point, but that was the last thing on her mind. She just wanted to stay longer in the hopes that the doctor might come back.</p><p>She gave a gentle shake of her head, her eyes flicking back up to Doctor Vidal, who was wearing a look of concern that was probably bordering on unprofessional.</p><p>"Is there anyone we can call?"</p><p>Again, Agatha shook her head.</p><p>"I live alone." That was one fact Agatha could recall with crystal clarity.</p><p>Although it happened so quickly Agatha could have sworn she hallucinated it, the doctor's lips turned down, just barely, at the corners, and a flash of softness and empathy skittered across her eyes. And then, it was gone.</p><p>"Alright, well, your stats look good for right now. If you're hungry, we can get something sent up, but otherwise, I'll be back in an hour or so to check on you." She reached down, giving Agatha's arm a sympathetic pat with another warm smile before she turned to leave the room.</p><p>And there Agatha sat, wishing she would just come back.</p><p>She got it, the woman was a busy doctor, had other patients to be tending do, but Agatha couldn't stop thinking about how she could have sat there for hours, just listening to her talk. She had such a beautiful cadence, such a control over the tones she chose to use. She was so poised, so... perfect.</p><p>Was she a stranger? Sure. But that feeling that had filled Agatha for those brief moments where she had considered that someone had shown up for her? That was a feeling Agatha had not had in a very long time, and she selfishly wanted to live in it a little longer.</p><p>Instead, she slumped into the pillows and struggled with the remote for a moment before turning the television on. She had eventually landed on Forensic Files, hoping that maybe the narrator's voice might lull her into sleep like it did most nights she struggled to sleep in the silence.</p><p>She was waffling between trying to focus or trying to let herself get relaxed enough to catch a little bit of a nap, but she couldn't stop her mind's non-stop turning. She couldn't stop thinking about the doctor. It was stupid, especially the more she came back into herself, little by little.</p><p>She had made a fool of herself in front of a very beautiful, very intelligent woman.</p><p>And somehow, ruminating on her own stupidity seemed to be the only thing that could detract from the godawful pain in her skull.</p><p>She had thought, with the meds and the rest, that it would get better but she could have sworn it had only gotten worse in the hour it took Doctor Vidal to make her way back to Agatha's room.</p><p>"Hi, Ms. Harkness, how are you feeling?" she posed, pulling up the rolling stool to perch at the side of the bed, affording them the ability to have a more level conversation.</p><p>Agatha exhaled a soft grunt. "It's still... pretty bad."</p><p>Doctor Vidal reached up and pulled the pen that had been tucked into her bun out of her hair and flipped it over to the end that had not been relentlessly chewed on. She scooted a little more toward the bed and held it up.</p><p>"Follow the end with your eyes, please," she requested, and though it was a pretty common ask, there was something... gentle about it.</p><p>Agatha tried to do as she was told, but there was still a struggle to execute the command, and the doctor seemed to notice it.</p><p>She folded her arms across the tops of her thighs and leaned toward the bed, studying Agatha's face as she built her plan of attack.</p><p>"While we're waiting for a room to open up, I'd like to get you in for an MRI, just in case there was anything the CT scan might have missed." She was so authoritative, so concise in the way she spoke. It was like watching moving poetry. "Once I get the results, I'll be back to go over them with you."</p><p>She gave another nod, accompanied by another sweet smile as she departed.</p><p>Agatha was right back to wishing she didn't have to come and go like that. Maybe she'd started to gain her footing again, but she couldn't stop thinking about the first thing she'd seen when she had really opened her eyes.</p><p>She had tried to focus on the television, but it hadn't been all that long by the time a man came to grab her for the additional scan.</p><p>Part of her was glad she'd been out cold for the first one, mostly because she hated confined spaces. Elevators? Not so bad. Anything smaller? Fuck that.</p><p>So, for the better part of ten minutes, Agatha fought the pain in her head, the sounds of the machine, and her urge to completely dissolve by taking the longest, slowest, most even breaths she could manage. By the time it was over, she had finally been able to breathe easier.</p><p>She was rolled back to her room and left, once again, to wait.</p><p>Agatha hated hospitals.</p><p>In her discombobulated state, that fact had not really settled in. After that rather sobering MRI? She was very much reminded why she hated hospitals.</p><p>
<i>"It's okay, momma, don't cry. I'm gonna be big and strong again."</i>
</p><p>There was a sudden and sharp thrum of pain somewhere on the upper right side that made Agatha wince, a low whine sounding from deep in her chest.</p><p>Before she could slip into the memories deep enough to drown in them, someone came to take her to the room they would be keeping her in overnight. It was a short trip up the elevator and it really didn't have much of a different vibe than the confines of the emergency department.</p><p>She still wanted out.</p><p>Before she could briefly consider the idea of just ripping out her IV and leaving, Doctor Vidal appeared in the doorway, giving a light tap with her knuckles to the open wooden door.</p><p>"Hey again, Ms. Harkness," she greeted, but this time Agatha corrected her.</p><p>"It's Agatha. Ms. Harkness was my mother."</p><p>Dr. Vidal gave an understandingly curt dip of her chin, as if to silently acknowledge that she was sorry.</p><p>"So," she stated, shifting over to the white panel on the wall. She slipped the film between her fingers into the hold at the top of the panel before she reached up to flip on the light. "Do you see this dark spot right here? Back right?"</p><p>Agatha gave a small nod in response; whatever it was, she was sure it wasn't good.</p><p>"We had initially spotted some bruising on the CT, but it is a bit more severe than we'd first thought. It's still not horrible, and there's no bleeding whatsoever, but you might have a pretty wicked headache for the next couple of days."</p><p>Agatha bit back her sarcastic commentary; that was good. She was feeling good enough to have a sarcastic inner monologue, at the very least.</p><p>"So, we're still going to keep you just to make sure it doesn't worsen in any way, and if it does, we're here to treat it immediately."</p><p>"Thank you, Doctor," Agatha said back softly, though at this point, she'd been avoiding those beautiful honey colored eyes.</p><p>The doctor fell quiet for a moment, and when she spoke, Agatha wished she just wouldn't have said anything.</p><p>"I'll be transferring your case over to the attending on this floor, Dr. Calderu, and she will take good care of you."</p><p>At this, an unreasonable ripple of panic tore through Agatha's chest, her wide eyes sweeping up despite the pain in her head.</p><p>"You're... leaving?" Agatha asked.</p><p>She wouldn't have admitted it, but this was the most time she had spent with another person one-on-one in an incredibly long time, and despite the fact that Dr. Vidal had been mostly professional, Agatha's trauma-logged mind at still locked those little quips that the other woman had tacked onto what she was saying, contradicting the initial message.</p><p>
<i>Sorry to disappoint.</i>
</p><p>
<i>If it were under any other circumstances...</i>
</p><p>"My shift's over in ten. I'll be filling out paperwork and then heading home, but I promise you that Calderu is one of the best in the hospital. I'm pretty sure that they built this hospital around her, honestly."</p><p>There was this sound that filled the air; it was so light, but so genuine. And then Agatha realized what it was.</p><p>Dr. Vidal was laughing.</p><p>Did she really have to go?</p><p>"Okay," Agatha huffed in a resigned sigh. In the next breath, she realized that she was being rather rude. Her eyes lifted to take in one last good look of the gorgeous doctor that had been the first thing she'd seen when she'd come to. "I really appreciate your kindness today. I... really needed it."</p><p>Dr. Vidal's face softened, her head doing that thing again where it tilted just slightly to the side, just studying her. But this time, she was not examining. She was just... looking. Watching.</p><p>"It's been my pleasure. You, at the very least, did not try to bite me when I took your temperature like the guy who was three beds down from you."</p><p>This time, it was Agatha that laughed, wincing at the amount of pain it caused in almost every inch of her head.</p><p>"Have a good night, Agatha. Get some rest."</p><p>And with that, in those teal scrubs and her white coat, Dr. Vidal disappeared around the corner of the doorway.</p><p>And as was normal anymore, Agatha was alone again.</p><p>She had thought about telling her nurse that she was hungry, but even if she <i>felt</i> hungry, she was not entirely certain that she could stomach much of anything at that time. She was starting to grow restless, starting to fall back into that state of mind where she was reminded why she hated hospitals so fucking much, but she was pulled right back by a soft tap on the door.</p><p>As her eyes shifted, falling on the open doorway, she was entirely shocked to see Dr. Vidal standing there, now dressed in a t-shirt and a pair of sweatpants that she had pulled up mid-calf. Her hair was free from the confines of that bun and fell down over her shoulders in the slightest waves.</p><p>If Agatha had thought she was beautiful before?</p><p>In that moment, that woman was a goddamned vision.</p><p>The doctor's hand that had been hanging at her side swung up, clearly showcasing the two popsicles she was holding.</p><p>"Thought maybe you could afford to put something on your stomach," she offered, though she made no move to step into the room.</p><p>Agatha's soft gaze was the one to study her this time. She had clearly said that she was getting off work, that she was going to go home. So what was she doing standing in that doorway, holding popsicles?</p><p>"I thought you were headed home?" Agatha questioned, and that same softness that Agatha had caught a glimpse of before seemed to melt the doctor's features.</p><p>"I was... But... Look, I know it's not professional, but..."</p><p>"You pity me for being alone," Agatha offered, though it wasn't an accusation. It was a statement, a fact of the world she lived in.</p><p>At this, Dr. Vidal's shoulders slumped slightly. "Not pity," she clarified, though she had not dropped her hand, the popsicles still obvious in their offering. "More like empathy."</p><p>Agatha's eyes dropped to the popsicle and raised again. When their eyes met, she gave a gentle nod of permission, telling her it was okay to come inside. This time, instead of placing herself on the stool again, she moved over to the other side of the bed where there was an actual chair.</p><p>Dr. Vidal handed over the popsicle and leaned back in her chair, taking a bite of her own. She swallowed and sat up a little bit more.</p><p>"How are you feeling?" she asked, though there was a touch of genuine concern to her tone.</p><p>"Better now," Agatha responded, humming softly. "It's almost not so bad that if I close my eyes, I might be able to go back to dreaming you're my girlfriend," she mused, though there was a ring of teasing to her tone. She hesitated, though, her eyes lifting. "Sorry, that probably was not as funny to you as it was in my aching head."</p><p>Dr. Vidal leaned forward a little bit, her lips pulled back in a small smile.</p><p>"It wasn't as funny as it was... sweet. I mean, there's a <i>lot</i> of attractive women out there in the world to fantasize about being your girlfriend. The fact that it was me?" Her smile shifted, the tiniest bit, almost a smirk but no quite. "I'll take the compliment for what it is."</p><p>Agatha offered a small shrug; that was a pretty diplomatic answer if she'd ever heard it, but it didn't match Dr. Vidal's body language.</p><p>"But, really." Ah, back to business again. "Your pain level is okay?"</p><p>"It's still not great, but it's better than it used to be," she admitted; her headache had dulled, but it had only allowed her to become more acutely aware of how bad her midsection hurt.</p><p>"I'm just glad we were able to get that second look. Helps us treat it better."</p><p>"Well," Agatha mused with a soft chuckle. "Lucky for me, I had a good doctor."</p><p>"You still do," Dr. Vidal returned. "She's just not as funny as I am."</p><p>"Or good looking."</p><p>Oh. Well. <i>Merde.</i></p><p>Agatha's lips pressed into a tight, embarrassed line, but the look on the doctor's face? She looked... flattered?</p><p>After a brief pause, though, she got to her feet, dropping the popsicle wrapper into the trash bin by the bed. "I'm going to head home. Is there anything else I can do for you before I go?"</p><p>Agatha watched her, trying to find any reason she could that might keep her there a little longer, but then realized she was being selfish. Still, she couldn't help but let it show a little bit.</p><p>"I assume my earlier question is still off the table?" Agatha asked, though she wasn't exactly assertive. She was bracing herself for rejection.</p><p>Dr. Vidal had already pulled her phone into her hand, but her eyes lifted at Agatha's question, and for the longest moment, she seemed to be holding some kind of internal debate.</p><p>"I can't give you my number," she finally said, but at the same time, the sound of her phone unlocking hit Agatha's ears.</p><p>In a shift so sudden, the doctor's eyes grew wide, as if she had just remembered something. She dropped the phone, unlocked, on the bed and bolted out the door.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha was shocked. She just blinked at the empty doorway. And then, her eyes cast down.</p><p>Dr. Vidal's phone was laying face up on the bed next to her leg, and there was clearly a 'new contact' page open.</p><p>
<i>Oh.</i>
</p><p>Hurriedly, Agatha scooped up the phone and typed in her name and number as quickly as she could before locking it again and putting it back right where it had landed when the doctor had tossed it.</p><p>A moment later, Dr. Vidal returned, looking mildly out of breath.</p><p>"Forget something?" Agatha asked, though she was unable to fight the smile that was nearly taking over her face.</p><p>"Yes! My phone! Can't leave without that!" the doctor asserted, stepping forward to pick it up off the bed.</p><p>The moment she did, though, their eyes met and the biggest grin seemed to cover her face, nearly sucker punching Agatha right in the stomach.</p><p>"Have a good night, Agatha."</p><p>"You too, Dr. Vidal."</p>

<p>By the time 3:30pm had rolled around the next day, Agatha had been handed discharge papers and a small stack of scripts that probably could have put down a horse. With the way that it hurt to move? Maybe that wasn't the worst thing in the world.</p><p>By 3:30, as Agatha had put on her duffel coat, which was filthy from the wet street she had wound up in, she had not seen hide nor hair of Dr. Vidal.</p><p>What was even worse?</p><p>She'd never texted, either.</p><p>There was a dull sting, somewhere near the middle of her chest at the thought. She couldn't help but to find herself thinking about it, stewing on it. Why had she made such a show of leaving her phone like that -- surely initiating a very obvious show of plausible deniability -- and then... nothing?</p><p>Deep down, Agatha had known better, and she was beginning to kick herself, multiple times, for ever having thought that she, Agatha Harkness, would ever actually catch the attention of someone like Dr. Vidal.</p><p>Ugh, that was annoying.</p><p>She didn't even know her first name.</p><p>Agatha slumped into a chair in the lobby, with as much care as she could manage to not completely wreck herself before she got the chance to even leave. She pulled out her phone and couldn't help the disappointed downturn of her lips at the realization that she still did not have a text from an unsaved number. Instead, she punched in her order for an Uber, one that arrived about ten minutes later. Even as she stood to exit the front doors, she couldn't help but to look over her shoulder, as if that one glance might be the one that presented an opportunity.</p><p>Well, it had been worth a shot, hadn't it?</p><p>What was that bullshit quote? Something about 'missing 100% of the shots you don't take?'</p><p>Agatha missed 100% of every shot she did or didn't take.</p><p>The only thing that seemed to be going steady for her was her position at the university, and even that? Well, she was likely going to be laid up in bed with body and headaches that she would much rather not deal with for the next week, at least.</p><p>She wanted to be in her lecture hall. She wanted to be commanding the space, to be the one who literally held the knowledge that would help her students obtain their degrees.</p><p>Perhaps some of it was a power trip.</p><p>She could be a bit of a hard-ass, and her students either loved her or hated her. If they were attentive, asked questions, and displayed a thorough understanding of the curriculum? Chances were, they were on her good side. The students that would fall asleep, cause disruptions, or otherwise seem disinterested? Those were the ones she would fail with the first justified opportunity, leaving her to field emails from angry entitled parents who didn't understand why their child wasn't passing a class with flying colors when they spent half of it watching the backs of their own eyelids.</p><p>Agatha didn't have impossible standards, but they were up there. It wasn't necessarily the bare minimum that satisfied her, but usually the students who were engaging were the ones doing it because it meant something to them, because it meant that they were going to go on in life and use the things she was teaching them to do better for themselves, maybe even those around them. Hell, with the power of voice and the option to choose which words to use?</p><p>Those kids could be unstoppable, if they really wanted to be.</p><p>Agatha had been unstoppable once. By twenty-three, she'd obtained two degrees, an MA in English, as well as an M.Ed. In layman's terms, she'd managed to pull off an incredible academic feat by double majoring for Masters programs, and she had nearly run herself ragged doing it.</p><p>But one thing Agatha could never do, not even if she actively tried, was give up.</p><p>It was why she was trying to stop moving for the first time in fifteen years, wasn't it? It was why she had tried to just still herself, to try and remember that she didn't have to keep running when what she was running from wasn't going anywhere. And so, for the last two years, Agatha had simply been trying to live with herself.</p><p>She didn't think herself to be an insufferable person; she knew how to laugh, how to hold conversation, how to be social -- even if she hated it. The Agatha that stepped out the front door of that townhome was an Agatha that, on the surface, seemed to live a normal life. Even the Agatha that climbed out of the back of that Uber, beat to absolute shit, would have seemed like any other face in Boston.</p><p>When Agatha came home, and that door closed behind her?</p><p>She was alone.</p><p>She was always alone.</p><p>It was a difficult feeling, sometimes, though she had done her best to find ways to fill her time, which mostly included going to the movies alone or -- on the nights when that deep, harrowing ache of the loneliness was just too much to bear -- at the local bar she frequented for its lack of male patrons.</p><p>That, and they made a <i>really good</i> pickle pizza.</p><p>It seemed stupid, but at the end of a hard week, she could tuck into that little bar, drink a couple of beers and somehow managed to flirt her way into someone else's bed for the night. It was often nothing more than a drop in the bucket, and as she would always let herself in no later than 3am, that door slamming behind her, she knew it had never really made much difference.</p><p>If anything, Agatha was a creature of habit. She was the kind of person who fell back into old, already-trekked paths, the divots of previous usage showing a clear direction. It wasn't that she didn't like to be adventurous in the day to day, it was just that she simply didn't see a point in it. She didn't understand what purpose doing things outside of the box held when there was no one around to share it with her.</p><p>She was fully aware that she should not have been hinging her own happiness on having someone to share it with, but she also knew that she'd had a chance to share her life with someone in a different capacity, and that had been taken from her, too.</p><p>After grabbing a bag of frozen peas from the freezer and an ice pack for her head, Agatha trudged up the stairs and poured herself into bed.</p><p>There she was, staring at that ceiling again.</p><p>Alone. Again.</p><p>Before she could find herself drowning in the thoughts of Nicky that usually swallowed her whole in the confines of that bedroom, there was something about the daylight that allowed a different train of thought.</p><p>The doctor.</p><p>Well, shit. That one wasn't a whole lot better, was it?</p><p>Although most of it was only visible through some fog, Agatha had laid there, simply replaying everything she could clearly recall from their few interactions that had happened throughout the day.</p><p>She had the nicest smile, and the brightest eyes with the most unique color. Her voice? It felt like a warm blanket on another frozen Boston morning. That face being the first thing she saw clearly when she woke up in a place that she absolutely detested? It had obviously been enough to pacify her, and even lead her to agree to stay, which likely would have never happened had she had any other doctor.</p><p>Agatha tried not to be a difficult person, but it was sort of her thing. She just... Didn't typically take to the fact that things couldn't always happen as she thought they should.</p><p>Right then?</p><p>She was absolutely not taking to the fact that Dr. Vidal had created an entire display to get her information, and yet, it had been almost twenty-four hours and there was still nothing. It made Agatha's jaw clench, though she was hit with an immediate wave of regret as it happened, her head swimming for a moment.</p><p>Dr. Calderu had told her it was likely that with the severity of what had happened, she probably wasn't going to feel like herself for a few days, and Agatha had never even given any thought to how true it would turn out to be.</p><p>She had thought, like everything else in her life, if she ignored it then it would simply just go away.</p><p>Had that ever <i>actually</i> worked, though?</p><p>That answer was painfully obvious.</p><p>It was why Agatha, bruised and miserable, had no one to call. She had tried to make friends, she really had, but those few attempts had typically landed her with the glowing label of 'Does Not Play Well With Others.' Sure, it was extreme sometimes, but Agatha didn't tolerate inauthenticity, and it was really fucking hard to come across authentic people anymore. She kept working relationships with other academics on campus, and she might have ventured to call some of them friends, but not in the sense that she would ever ask anything of them.</p><p>But damn, if Dr. Vidal hadn't seemed like the most true version of what a person could be. She had been kind, sure, and her bedside manner had been superb when she was on the clock, but it was when she happened to be off the clock that Agatha couldn't stop winding herself around.</p><p>It seemed stupid to get hung up on it. It seemed like a fool's errand to continue to give it more thought, more weight. But, truthfully? It was already sinking her like a stone. She was trying to wrestle back her control, but it had perhaps been a little too long since she'd even had it to begin with.</p><p>Even with the rest and the medications she'd had delivered to her home, there was one thing that wouldn't stop aching, vibrating her bones themselves, even as the physical wounds began to fade, no matter how much time she was trying to give it.</p><p>It had been ten days, and she had never received a text message.</p><p>It shouldn't have been as disappointing as it was; realistically, Dr. Vidal had stated it very plainly. Agatha had been a patient, and that ran a great deal of risk for her. It could put her license to practice medicine at risk, and that would have been the absolute last thing that Agatha would have wanted. Clearly, she was doctor for a reason; it was something she had been passionate about, and having been on the receiving end of her care? Agatha could say with an only slightly-biased opinion that she was good at her job.</p><p>What she was not good at was metaphorically opening a door, leaving it wide enough for someone to run through, but when on the other side?</p><p>She was nowhere to be found.</p><p>The door had been opened, but Dr. Vidal had already left.</p><p>It left Agatha feeling indignant, especially as the days wore on and she knew she was going to have to convince herself to let it go.</p><p>Two weeks in?</p><p>With her ability to be back in classes, it had helped distract her, helped renew her sense of purpose. She was doing good work at the university, and it was finally something better to do than getting lost in some big city with no agenda and picking up odd jobs when she could. This was a career, this was something she could ground herself in, something she was <i>good</i> at.</p><p>The one thing she was good at.</p><p>It was another cold day and Agatha had only a morning lecture that day, so she had made the executive decision to hoof it to Cardullo's for a sandwich and a cup of soup after she finished her paperwork.</p><p>She was stood, leg bouncing, at the corner of the crosswalk. This time, she'd had enough sense to have a beanie atop her head to keep the chill from biting at her ears.</p><p>She had been watching the sign across the street, waiting for it to change when she felt her phone vibrate in her chest pocket; she'd check it when she got to the deli. However, before any other thought could strike her, she felt someone brush by her, a woman.</p><p>She saw the snapdragon first, woven perfectly into dark hair, a pop of color in an otherwise grey Boston winter. What she realized immediately after? The woman's head was tucked and she just kept walking, as if there were not five other people waiting to cross the street.</p><p>But she kept going, and Agatha's eyes flew up, the sight of the car about three feet to her left as it rolled toward the corner to make its turn.</p><p>The woman still wasn't paying attention, fixated on her phone.</p><p>Kids and their goddamned phones.</p><p>It took all of three seconds to process in Agatha's brain as she understood that neither the car or the woman were going to stop. In a sudden surge, she pressed forward, an arm extending as a strong hand hooked around the woman's bicep, pulling her back with a sizeable amount of force as the car completed its turn, right in the path of where the woman had been walking.</p><p>"Jesus, are you okay?!" Agatha asked the back of the woman's head, the sound of alarm clear in her voice, though she had half a mind to reprimand her for being so careless because she was too absorbed in her phone.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm sorr--" the woman had started to respond, and something in Agatha froze, even though it was just a hair above an actually freezing temperature outside.</p><p>Agatha knew that voice.</p><p>At the same time the woman had been speaking, she had also started to turn around, and the moment their eyes met?</p><p>Agatha almost choked on the breath she had halfway into her lungs. There was no way, right? There had to be some explanation outside of what was directly in front of her. Had her injury been worse than she'd thought? Was it possible that she was suffering through some kind of side effects that no one had really been able to foresee?</p><p>Anything had to make more sense than the fact that she was looking nearly straight ahead into the eyes of Dr. Vidal.</p><p>"Doctor?" was the only word she could manage, the shock both audible in her tone and completely written all over her face.</p><p>Then, her expression shifted, a subtle scolding that she did not quite verbalize. Instead, something a little softer came out.</p><p>"You scared the shit out of me." Her lips pursed, her gaze admonishing. "What could be so important on that phone that you felt the need to not watch where you were going?" Well, maybe a little bit of that scolding had come out, anyway, however unintentionally.</p><p>"It's Rio," the other woman voiced, though there was this expression on her face that Agatha could not immediately put her finger on. Her eyes dropped to her phone, and then lifted back up to Agatha. "I was... texting you, actually," she responded, and Agatha simply blinked</p><p>
<i>What?</i>
</p><p>"You're lying," Agatha bit back before she could stop herself.</p><p>But then, Agatha looked at her, really took a good look at her. The day was grey, but there was no way the shit sunlight made her look so damn tired, like the weight of the day had been pulling her down, and it was only half past noon. The fact that Agatha had called her a liar? That seemed to settle, too, her eyes dropping down to her phone again as her lips turned down at the corners.</p><p>She studied it for a moment, but then held the phone up, right in front of Agatha's face, so she could see it clearly.</p><p>There, on the right hand side of the screen was a text bubble with one word.</p><p>'Hey.'</p><p>Then, below it, there was a message still sitting in the text box beneath it.</p><p>'Shit, sorry. It's Rio. I mean Dr Vidal. I know it's been a while, and I'm really sorry, but I was hoping you might entertain me with a conversation before you block me. If not, I unders'</p><p>Agatha blinked. And then, she blinked again. Immediately, her hand flew up to her chest, patting frantically. She shoved her hand inside, fishing around in the pocket to produce her own phone. She lit up the screen, and for the second time, her breath got hung up somewhere on its way out.</p><p>There, from a 617 area code, was a message that, in its entirety, read:</p><p>'Hey.'</p><p>Agatha's eyes raised from her own phone, finding their way across that space into those opposing dark eyes. Damn, those really were some beautiful eyes.</p><p>Rio's lips worried together in a tight line, though Agatha could clearly see that there was a storm raging on the other side of that gaze. She looked like she wanted to say something, but wanted to say many somethings at the same time, and she could not quite parse through them enough to find the right words.</p><p>"I..." she began, and Agatha had almost forgotten that they were still standing on that street corner, people coming and going around the two of them, like they were locked in a vacuum where no one could really break the moment. "I wanted to apologize, firstly. But I..." her eyes dropped to Agatha's brown boots, fixing for the longest moment before she looked back up, that little skip in thought seeming to fire through Agatha's brain.</p><p>"I just needed a friend."</p><p>At those words, something in Agatha flinched. They weren't friends, but Agatha had gathered enough of a read on the situation to know that stating it so plainly would benefit neither of them. Instead, she recognized it for what it actually was: Rio was asking if she could consider being one.</p><p>Wasn't that what Agatha had wanted the entire time? She'd just wanted more of this woman's time, but she had also let herself forget the kind of taxing profession Rio had placed herself in.</p><p>"Rio," she voiced, but it was more of an acknowledgement, and also a response to her statement. More than that, though... Agatha liked the way it tasted on her lips.</p><p>Agatha's eyes flickered up, down the street, and then fell back to Rio, who was still in front of her, only about a foot of space between them.</p><p>"I don't know where you were going, but I'm headed to Cardullo's. My morning lecture left me starved. If you'd like to join me, lunch is on me."</p><p>There was the smallest wavering, this look in Rio's eyes that betrayed her, disclosing just how much the offer might break her. She blinked, though, and it was suddenly gone. Instead, a gentle smile filled her face and the brief glass that had lent a shine to her gaze seemed to dry itself.</p><p>"That would actually be really amazing," she finally admitted, her shoulders slumping with the weight that had been lifted at the fact that this was not about to take a complete nosedive.</p><p>"It's just down the street. But maybe we should wait for the 'walking guy' light before we cross, hm?" she posed, though her tone was not nearly as pointed as the words might have implied it should have been.</p><p>At this, Rio actually laughed. It wasn't a full laugh, but it wasn't a chuckle. It was the sound of someone who wanted to find humor in an otherwise dreary and depressing day.</p><p>Gods, what the hell had happened to her that day?</p><p>They walked in a silence that was not quite awkward, but was instead slightly tense. Agatha's mind was running laps and somehow smacking into every hurdle each round.</p><p>It had been two weeks since she'd been hit by that car. Two long weeks where Dr. Vidal -- Rio -- had not reached out to her. She tried to be understanding, to take in the full scope of how they had come to be acquainted, but some part of her still couldn't help but feel slighted. As they paced up to the deli, Agatha pulled the door open, nodding her head for Rio to go in ahead of her.</p><p>As she stepped up, almost shoulder to shoulder with the other woman, she tucked her hands into her pockets. Her head tilted back as her eyes scanned the menu, though she knew what she was going to get. The same thing she always got, every chance she had the time to pop in.</p><p>"Have you been here before?" Agatha posed, her head tipping slightly as she asked the question, though her eyes never tore away from the menu.</p><p>"No, but a lot of colleagues rave about it." Rio's eyes scanned the menu, but she was quick with a follow-up. "What do you get?"</p><p>"The caprese and prosciutto. They make their pesto in-house," Agatha disclosed, her gaze fully shifting this time as she took in the profile of the woman next to her. Her nose had such a gentle slope, curving adorably at the tip. She had thick, long lashes that weren't quite long enough to be artificial. And the way her lips kept rubbing against each other like that? They were full, thick lips, probably soft, too.</p><p>Harkness!</p><p>"What about you? What sounds good?"</p><p>"You said in-house pesto?" Rio posed curiously, her own attention turning more toward Agatha in question.</p><p>"Sure did," Agatha responded.</p><p>"I'll do the caprese, please." She hesitated, those lips worrying again. "I can afford to pay for my own lunch. After all, shouldn't I be buying yours? You did sort of save me from getting mowed over as a result of my own stupidity."</p><p>Agatha's own lips twisted for a moment in thought, though she was still looking at Rio, who finally turned to meet her gaze.</p><p>"Well... by my logic... You saved me, I saved you. That sets us at a neutral base.  Therefore, I can choose to buy you lunch now, and you'll just owe me next time."</p><p>Something shimmered in those honey eyes, something that started to thaw the coldest parts of Agatha.</p><p>"Next time, huh?" Rio posed, though her tone gave away that she was probably a little more moved by the insinuation than all else.</p><p>"You said you needed a friend. So... Friends hang out more than one time, right?" she posed, her tone indicating that the logic she was putting forth should have been airtight and completely fool-proof. As they shuffled forward in line, Agatha's gaze ran a scan, just taking a full look at the woman before her in line.</p><p>"No prosciutto?" Agatha asked, just to make sure.</p><p>Rio shook her head. "I'm a vegetarian. I used to say it wasn't by choice, but I don't really mind it so much anymore."</p><p>"How is someone a vegetarian... not by choice?" Agatha asked, though the question wasn't skeptical, simply curious.</p><p>"When I was fourteen, I was bitten by a lone star tick. As a result, I got alpha-gal syndrome, which pretty much means I have a reaction to a sugar that's found in the majority of mammals, but not humans. So... no matter how badly I'm craving a medium rare steak, I know that it will definitely not be worth the hives that can last up to two days."</p><p>Ugh, that cadence. What was it about the sound of her voice that was just so... comforting, even when she was clearly distressed?</p><p>Her posture was miles away from the confident stance she had seen from Rio that day in the hospital. She seemed so... deflated. She was aware that she arguably knew this woman, but there was something so obvious about the fact that she was shouldering some really heavy shit, and while maybe she didn't want to talk about it? That was fine; Agatha could be a distraction, if need be.</p><p>Maybe a distraction was something Rio needed, or maybe it wasn't, but deep down Agatha was just a little thrilled that she was finally getting her wish. She was finally getting more time with this gorgeous, big-brained woman.</p><p>Another push emptied them out at the registers and Agatha stepped up, placing the order for their sandwiches, deciding against the cup of soup for herself, though she did ask Rio if she'd like one, but was not entirely surprised when she declined. She seemed... What was the word? Uncomfortable? Was she uncomfortable that Agatha was being nice to her after she had ghosted her for two weeks?</p><p>Would Agatha have had every reason in the world to have politely informed her that her communication skills sucked and she was a very 'mixed-signals' type of person? Of course, but just looking at her?</p><p>She wasn't sure why she was so certain, but Agatha knew that she'd been through some shit. Rio had been so bright, so vibrant, and while Agatha could have blamed it on good bedside manner, she'd kept that up even after she had come back that night with those stupid popsicles.</p><p>Agatha swiped her card to pay and with a gentle flourish of a hand, indicated to Rio where to go to wait as their food was prepared. She almost asked her, right then what had happened, as they stood and waited. It was right on the tip of her tongue, but something in Agatha knew that it would probably be a question best left for a less open space.</p><p>The tray with their sandwiches slid across the stainless steel counter and the man behind it rang the bell, announcing her order number. Agatha thanked him and slid it off of the countertop before she glanced back up to see the two sodas she had also ordered. With her hands full, though, her eyes fell on Rio, who seemed to catch on instantly. She pushed forward and reached up, pulling them down before she stepped back to allow Agatha to lead the way.</p><p>Decidedly, she tucked them into a corner booth, back far enough away that any bustle in the restaurant wouldn't really reach them.</p><p>She was focused on her work as she doled out their meals and set the tray aside to free up some space on the table. Her eyes lifted, though, and took in the woman sat across from her, who happened to be looking at her sandwich like she had no idea how she was going to choke it down.</p><p>"Rio..." Agatha voiced softly. In a move that she was certain she did not carry out an order for in her own mind, her hand lifted off the table and moved, her fingertips brushing gently over the back of Rio's knuckles.</p><p>The moment she realized, though, she pulled back, the look on her face communicating that she'd had no idea why she'd just done that.</p><p>"Are you... okay?"</p><p>The moment she asked it, Agatha could see it.</p><p>She'd just taken a sledgehammer to the carefully constructed facade that Rio had been wearing since the moment their eyes met on that corner.</p><p>Her expression didn't shatter, but it did crack. Perhaps she was double paned, not quite so easily broken.</p><p>"My best friend is another doctor at the hospital, Julia. Her boyfriend is an attending, one from the pediatrics floor. They were leaving after shift last night when their car was hit by a transit bus that had lost its brakes."</p><p>Agatha's face fell as the gravity of what Rio had been carrying with her seemed to settle over them like a lead blanket.</p><p>"Are they okay?" Agatha asked automatically; she didn't know these people, but she needed them to be okay for the simple fact that they were clearly important to the woman in front of her.</p><p>"They will be. Johan's shoulder broke in three different places, and Julia has a couple of broken ribs, but nothing they won't heal from."</p><p>Rio exhaled a soft huff, a pained smile tugging on her lips.</p><p>"Yesterday was actually supposed to be my last day in emergency. I had applied for a transfer to peds, to work with Johan actually, but... After the accident, after seeing it all and knowing that the only reason it all kept moving was because of me?" Rio sighed again, pressing her fingertips in short lines across her forehead. "My blood sweat and tears are on that emergency room floor, and while the idea of a more manageable schedule and less chaos seem incredibly appealing... I called and cancelled the transfer."</p><p>Agatha was rapt, just fixated on anything and everything this woman had to say. It was the weight of the message, though, that caused an understanding expression to fit to her features.</p><p>"Firstly, let me acknowledge the obvious that you might be missing here. Your friends are very lucky that you were the one there, making sure they were taken care of. Second..." Agatha paused, her eyes dropping to her sandwich before they flickered up toward her new companion. "I can tell that while you <i>know</i> you did the right thing, you're clearly still struggling."</p><p>Rio's expression shifted, hardening a bit, though her eyes were still soft.</p><p>"You're right," she admitted, a finger tapping mindlessly on the crust of the bread of her sandwich. "But, that can be an inner war for another day. Today, I'm just... thankful that you happened to be paying more attention than I was, and that, you know, we were in the exact same place at exactly the same time."</p><p>At this, Agatha offered a gentle laugh.</p><p>"Thank my morning lecture and my terrible memory for forgetting to eat a granola bar before I left for work."</p><p>Rio's features softened, her eyes sparkling at the new tidbit of information.</p><p>"You're a professor?" she asked, the interest in her voice clear.</p><p>Agatha gave an assured nod. "Of English at Harvard."</p><p>Though she tried to hide it, Agatha did not miss the slight fumble, the way Rio's eyes widened, but then checked themselves in their reaction, lids relaxing again.</p><p>"Well, aren't you just full of surprises?" Rio posed, picking up a piece of tomato that had fallen off of her sandwich and was laying on the parchment paper before she tossed it into her mouth, chewing thoughtfully. However, Agatha was quick to respond.</p><p>"Far fewer than you'd think, actually."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>When Agatha had opened her eyes into the day that morning, she had been blissfully free of thoughts of the doctor that she'd met a fortnight ago. She had finally shoehorned herself into the mind frame that it had been a one-off, something that would forever go down in her books as a missed opportunity.</p><p>Yet, there she sat, directly across from that soft-featured, charming, and charismatic woman who had nearly needed another doctor for the same reason Agatha had needed her.</p><p>Agatha was amazed. What were the odds, in all actuality? Boston was a big city. There were a lot of corners of it to get tucked into. There were a lot of places to disappear. Agatha had learned that in ways she had never thought she would have in the last couple of years, she had spent there.</p><p>As they began to eat, something was tugging at the back of Agatha's mind, something she was having a much harder time swallowing than the first few bites of her sandwich. She finished chewing and swallowed it down, debating on washing it down with a drink from her soda bottle. She decided, instead, that her question was a little more pressing.</p><p>"Why didn't you reach out... at literally any point over the last two weeks?" Agatha posed pointedly, raising an eyebrow in question.</p><p>She had caught Rio mid-bite, who looked like she was in a battle of wills on whether or not to continue taking it. After another beat, she lowered it and set it back down on the wax paper in front of her. The expression on her face was woven with guilt. Something in those gorgeous eyes screamed that she knew it was a fair question, even if it made her feel bad.</p><p>"Things at the hospital have been... crazy." Rio took a breath, pressing her lips together. "They started a remodel of the ED a few days after you were in and have been moving everyone around like a slide puzzle since. It's already the most chaotic part of the hospital, and they're just... seeing what fits where with only some regard to how we're supposed to manage it."</p><p>Rio's gaze had dropped, down to her sandwich that only had half a bite already taken out of it. Agatha was battling herself; she wanted to grill her and say that two weeks was a long time, but she could see that it was the last thing the woman before her needed that day. She'd already divulged that she was having a tough time and despite being a little affronted by the sleight Rio had dealt her, Agatha wasn't heartless.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha wondered what Rio had seen in her time as a doctor. How long had she been in medicine? What were her motivations? Did she want to please her parents? Did she lose someone she'd cared about and decided to devote her life to helping heal the sick? Agatha knew that she would never have answers without asking those questions.</p><p>There was a part, back in the little cove near Agatha's brain stem that could not help but feel like this might be the only time she had Rio's attention like this. It wasn't her fault that she was distrustful; Agatha had been burned too many times by people who said they cared, but then simply didn't.</p><p>Agatha was used to that. She was used to getting upset, saying the wrong thing and people just walking away. She had a temper, sure, but she was also a soft person at heart. It just so happened that no one got to see that side of her because she couldn't bring herself to let anyone in close enough. The idea that someone could see past the hard shell, sarcasm, and snip? Agatha didn't want anyone to see her for who she <i>really</i> was: A mother who couldn't save her son.</p><p>She'd been trying to stow away from that reality for a decade and a half and most days, that was easy enough to do.</p><p>On the day Agatha had met Rio?</p><p>It had almost felt impossible.</p><p>Grieving Nicky on the day of his death was one thing when she was staring at the ceiling of her townhome. Being completely knocked senseless and having to stay in the place that reminded her most of the pain and tears and long nights of watching Nicky slowly slip away into the ether was something else. The thinner he got, the more his eyes began to sink in. The memories, without the present gap of time, all blurred together in some kind of horror movie that lived with Agatha every day of her life.</p><p>Being in that setting again could have been crippling, but it hadn't been. Agatha hated admitting it, especially after two weeks of silence, but she knew that was down to Rio's presence. She'd been so warm, so concerned, and caring. She'd given enough of a shit to take some of her personal time to make Agatha feel a little less alone.</p><p>Rio had said it was out of empathy, but at the time Agatha had been skeptical. How could someone so... genuine be lonely? Then again, there were different levels of being lonely, weren't there?</p><p>Agatha was the kind of lonely that was indicative of isolation.</p><p>Other people could be lonely in a room full of people.</p><p>Maybe that was the way Rio felt.</p><p>Her features were fixed, firm but still etched with empathy as she debated how to respond to that. Being an asshole was out the window at this point, but outwardly showing compassion was something Agatha had not had to do in some time, outside of her students, which was more or less a job requirement.</p><p>"I get it, but a 'Hey, work is drowning me but I haven't forgotten that I made an entire display of getting your phone number despite my insistence that it wasn't a great idea' text would have gotten the job done," Agatha pointed out, though the statement was by no means any kind of a dig, it was simply pointing out facts.</p><p>"I know, I know," Rio conceded, hanging her head for a moment. She took in a steadying breath and raised her gaze to Agatha's, that inner war raging so clearly in every bit of her expression. "It wasn't right. And for what it's worth, my intent that night was undoubtedly fueled by interest. You..." Rio's lips twisted as she stopped herself short. "There's something different about you," she finally decided, and this struck Agatha.</p><p>"I promise you, there isn't," she returned, but Rio's face soured slightly, but then smoothed over again.</p><p>"Is that like... your thing?" Rio asked, her fingertips still tapping on that crust in a way that was beginning to make Agatha a little anxious.</p><p>"My <i>thing?</i>" Agatha returned, her tone touched with incredulity and curiosity. It turned it the slightest bit tight.</p><p>"Yeah," Rio said simply, picking another piece of tomato off of her sandwich and tossing it casually into her mouth. It was like she had just flipped a switch, deciding that digging into Agatha a little more was better than talking about herself. Her eyes met Agatha's across the table as she chewed as if that was all the answer she was going to give. Then, she spoke again. "The thing where you just constantly downplay yourself and act like your loneliness is your armor."</p><p>Agatha's jaw hinged a bit, her eyes wide. Who did this woman think she was to call her out so plainly like that?</p><p>"I'm sorry?" Agatha shot back, her brow pinching tightly above her nose. "And you know that after spending all of three hours with me, at max?"</p><p>Rio laughed, and it froze something inside of Agatha, who was watching her with a hot gaze as she so effortlessly opened her soda and took a good drink of it.</p><p>"I know that after the last fifteen minutes with you." Rio gave a forward tip of her head as if asking Agatha to probe.</p><p>Instead, Agatha's expression screwed up in annoyance.</p><p>"And I thought I was bad at making friends," Agatha huffed in return, leaning back into the booth as she folded her arms across her middle. "Is that just 'doctor confidence' or are you just generally this cocky?"</p><p>Rio's smile was instant, spreading like a fire across her lips. "I prefer to call it founded intuition," she disclosed as if it were some sort of secret despite not lowering her voice.</p><p>This woman was maddening.</p><p>"Plus," Rio voiced back, tilting her head, those dark honey eyes were so damn piercing. "It is painfully obvious that the fact that you very well could have saved my life today, no medical knowledge necessary, does not impact you in the way it should."</p><p>At this, Agatha's brow tried to pull even tighter. She'd helped who she thought to be a stranger because it was the right thing to do. Thinking about the consequences of not having done it was not something her mind had ever dared venture to before. There was no reason. Thinking about death was something Agatha had done for years; she didn't need to imagine it happening in her life moving forward, too.</p><p>"If I say 'it's not that big of a deal,' I entirely realize that it would just be proving your point. But I also do not think that I should be patting myself on the back for an act of human decency." Agatha's tone had started hard, but the longer they talked, the more she was softening. She meant it when she said that she didn't feel like she deserved any kind of special treatment for just trying to be a good person for one moment in a lifetime she had convinced herself she wasn't.</p><p>Rio let that answer sit with her for a moment, even though her eyes hard hardly left Agatha as she leaned against the booth backing.</p><p>"Tell me something about you that no one around you would ever be able to guess," Rio beguiled, her tone oddly sweet even though she was being an annoying pain in Agatha's ass the longer this went on.</p><p>Agatha's eyes narrowed, having completely forgotten about her meal at this point.</p><p>"Why should I?"</p><p>Rio grinned, leaning forward over the table a bit. "What do you have to lose? You tell me, we leave this deli and you never speak to me again, and then, what? You think I'm going to turn up on campus, telling every student that will listen to something you told me in confidence?" Rio hummed softly, a sparkle in her eyes. "Agatha, I know you don't know me... at all, yet... but I can apply the same logic of doctor-patient-confidentiality to this situation if it would make you feel better. Cone of silence. What's said at the table stays at the table, no matter how you feel about me when you leave. Fair?"</p><p>Rio was so... frustratingly charming.</p><p>Perhaps Agatha should have known that the night in the hospital after she had walked out of that door dressed in her civilian clothes, her hair falling over her shoulders in wonky curls from the way she'd had it pinned in the bun.</p><p>"Alright. Fair." It was short, and a little gruff, but it was a resignation nonetheless.</p><p>"So...?"</p><p>Agatha's eyes sparked; she was so goddamn persistent. Her lips were pinned together, almost turning white around the edges. She blew a huff through her nose, her arms instinctively tightening around her middle; she was shielding herself.</p><p>She had started to say that this was stupid, but... then she was reminded of how lonely it was going to feel when this was over and she went back to that empty townhome.</p><p>"I write poetry."</p><p>Rio's eyebrows both hiked in an instant, the shock registering immediately on her face. She had not been expecting such an admission, but wasn't that what she had asked for? She was prodding, poking, trying to see what she could get out of Agatha but she had not expected Agatha to bite. She looked... satisfied with herself. That smugness didn't last long, though, as those eyes softened and her expression turned a little more gentle.</p><p>"What kind of poetry?" The way Rio asked that question, it felt like the thinnest arrow, piercing right through Agatha's middle. It was... gentle, and curious. It wasn't judgmental, and the fact that she even knew to ask?</p><p>"Prose, mostly. But... I dabble in free style every now and again. It's just something to keep me busy. I picked it up while living in Budapest and sometimes it's the only thing that gets me through the shit nights." A corner of Agatha's lips lifted, just barely. She felt vulnerable, sharing this fact with someone she arguably knew, but it didn't seem to her -- at least not yet -- like this was something Rio could use against her if things didn't work out.</p><p>"An English professor who writes poetry," her low, rough tone mused in its delight. "How... <i>poetic.</i>"</p><p>Agatha's eyes instantly rolled.</p><p>"I didn't say they were all in English," Agatha countered back, a brow hiking in a challenge.</p><p>At this, Rio seemed to light up with a glow that Agatha had only seen in the doorway of her hospital room that night as she was bribing Agatha with popsicles.</p><p>"What other language do you speak?" The interest was clear now, and their meals had been entirely consigned into oblivion.</p><p>"Languages," Agatha corrected, her tone a little proud. "The only other one I'm undeniably fluent in is French, but I've learned enough Icelandic, Dutch, and German to be able to hold small conversations."</p><p>This seemed to strike a sense of wonder in Rio, who genuinely could not believe the things she was being told. She looked like a child on Christmas who was getting all of the gifts she had never known she wanted.</p><p>"How the hell did you learn to speak Icelandic?"</p><p>Agatha gave a small shrug of her shoulders as if it wasn't as much of a feat as Rio was making it sound.</p><p>"I lived in Iceland for about eight months, a little more. I went to the same coffee shop every day and while they do speak English, the more time I spent there, the more I got interested in learning. It's been that way with the majority of the places I've lived. It's a lot better of an experience when you're able to communicate with the locals in a way that makes them comfortable over frustrated."</p><p>"Huh," Rio breathed, the amazement written so plainly throughout her entire being, from her lax posture to that unnerving look on her face.</p><p>"Is there something you'd like to say?" Agatha shot back, tilting her head a bit defensively, those arms tightening again.</p><p>"You lied to me," Rio stated, though it didn't come across as an accusation. It was just... a statement.</p><p><i>"Excuse me?"</i> Agatha bit back, growing riled again.</p><p>"You told me when we sat down that you were full of fewer surprises than I might think. And that was a lie. Almost everything you've had to say at this table has not only surprised me, but it's also a little... perplexing."</p><p>Something Agatha realized was that while her field may have been medicine, Rio was still a very well-spoken individual. She was concise and careful with the words she used to convey herself, and with Agatha being who Agatha was? She appreciated it. Maybe she even found it a little... attractive?</p><p>She blinked the thought away with force, zeroing back in on Rio.</p><p>"Are you always this annoying when you make new friends?" Agatha questioned, and though she tried to keep her voice hard and make it sound like she was bristling, the way her posture slackened slightly gave her away.</p><p>"The only friends I have I've worked with for the last three years," Rio returned, but her shoulders sagged slightly. "And I'm not sure if I'd have them if I'd been put anywhere other than Mass Gen."</p><p>Ah, there it was. The admittance of what had only previously been implied hung between them like a lead weight, and Agatha was nervously watching to see if it was going to drop and obliterate the table between them.</p><p>Rio was lonely, too.</p><p>"And now, you're sat here with me, asking annoying questions in hopes that we can be friends," Agatha added, though her grip around her middle loosened yet again.</p><p>"That's an astute observation, Professor Agatha."</p><p>Agatha's eyes flickered in irritation, but it was a broad mask for the way her heart had nearly leaped into her throat. Agatha was used to people calling her Professor, but it was always Professor Harkness. The way Rio had sailed it to her, it was... something else. Something... deeper. There was no trace of respect in it like there was when it came from her students. This was... flirting?</p><p>"Is this... fun for you?" Agatha posed back, narrowing those blue eyes in interrogation.</p><p>"Is what fun for me? Skipping past bullshit small talk to find out if I can goad you enough to see if you'll walk?"</p><p>And then, like a speeding train, it hit her.</p><p>Rio was testing her.</p><p>Probably in the same way she would have been testing Rio, if she'd thought of it first.</p><p>"You're <i>trying</i> to annoy me?" Agatha asked back, her voice dubious.</p><p>"No," Rio answered simply. "I'm trying to find out who you are. If that annoys you... Is that a you thing or a me thing?"</p><p>Agatha's expression was somewhere a mix between frustration and admiration. She wanted to be mad, she wanted to ask Rio who she thought she was, but at the same time? It had been a very long time since anyone had cared enough to ask questions like that. Did Rio even care? How could she, when this was the longest consecutive amount of time that they had spent together?</p><p>"I don't feel like dignifying that with an answer," Agatha grumbled back, to which Rio only grinned.</p><p>Rio gave a little shrug, reaching down to pick up her sandwich before she took her first actual bite. She chewed, then hummed as she finished.</p><p>"That <i>is</i> good," Rio voiced, the surprise apparent in her voice. The way she looked so... happy? It softened Agatha a bit. Rio's face told a story similar to her own; granola bars, quick meals, and protein shakes for the harder days. It was probably the first actual meal she allowed herself to have in some time. That, Agatha thought, was something she could relate to.</p><p>"On Saturdays, they do freshly shaved pastrami on rye with Swiss. It sells out so quickly that they can't afford to do it every day. I highly recommend it." Agatha's entire demeanor had slowly shifted, leaving her a little less tense than she had been at Rio's grilling.</p><p>Agatha took another drink from her soda bottle and set it down, looking at it for a moment before she lifted her gaze to Rio.</p><p>"Where did you grow up?"</p><p>Rio's expression looked a little stuck like she was trying to play catch-up with the fact that Agatha had decided to engage. Even Agatha had not been entirely sure that she was going to indulge her, but she couldn't help it.</p><p>Rio had been right: Her trying to get to know Agatha had been more of an Agatha problem than a Rio one. Agatha had never been able to let that guard down for so long that as someone sat there, gently trying their best to dismantle it? It panicked her, it frustrated her, and it upset her. Those were all her issues, not Rio's.</p><p>Rio's lips curled up warmly, her head tilting just barely to the side.</p><p>"I was raised in Miami. I graduated Valedictorian of my class--"</p><p>At this, Agatha couldn't help but interject.</p><p>"Why is that somehow not surprising?"</p><p>A gentle shimmer of lights found its way to Rio's eyes, and even as she spoke? It didn't go away.</p><p>"Maybe you know me better than you think, already." The smile only seemed to grow. "But, when I went to med school, there was a program I had applied to that was my white whale, the one thing I wanted more than anything." Rio paused, a bit of mischief creeping into her expression. "Ask me where it was."</p><p>"Where did you go to med school, Rio?"</p><p>"Ohio."</p><p>At that answer? They were almost mirror images of one another as their lips cracked into grins and they began to laugh.</p><p>"What the fuck is in Ohio?" Agatha asked, trying to temper the belly laughter that had nearly overwhelmed her.</p><p>"OSU has one of the most thorough emergency medicine courses in the country. Plus," she added, "Clinical shadowing is done at The Wexner, which is one of the best hospitals in the state. Between Wex and The James, they're making groundbreaking moves in cancer treatment and heart disease. It was.. a great place to learn." The more Rio spoke, the more Agatha understood why she was asking the questions she had. Learning these things about a woman she'd just met? Agatha didn't know why, but it truly resonated somewhere within her.</p><p>Miami, to Columbus, to... Boston?</p><p>"So... how did you wind up going from the middle of Ohio to <i>bright and sunny</i> Boston, Massachusetts? Doesnt seem like a natural progression. You went from mid-west shit weather to..." Agatha glanced out the window next to them, waving her hand vaguely at it. "This shit. Not much of an upgrade, if you ask me."</p><p>"One of my instructors had a former student who used to work at Mass Gen who had reached out to him about anyone that might be a good fit. He talked to me about it and so I followed the proper channels, waited my time, and when I got hired?" The grin that found her face this time?</p><p>
<i>It was beautiful.</i>
</p><p>It reminded Agatha of the first time she'd opened her eyes to see that face. The time between them had soured Agatha's disposition and left her on the defense, but the more she listened to Rio speak with that tone, that cadence?</p><p>Agatha suddenly understood what she'd liked about it in the first place.</p><p>Rio spoke to her with a warmth that usually took months, if not years to build. That was alarming only because Rio didn't know what kind of mess she was getting into when it came to Agatha.</p><p>"I threw everything into a moving truck, hopped on a plane, and met the movers here. That was three years ago, and... here I am."</p><p>Agatha's lips twitched slightly at first. After another beat, they pulled to reveal a toothy smile.</p><p>"So... How many feet?" Agatha asked.</p><p>Rio's expression went from warm to completely confused.</p><p>"How many feet was your first big snowfall?" Agatha's smile spread wider; she loved the snow, she just hated the cold. The snow was... complex. It was, scientifically, frozen water. Each piece of it, though, was completely different from the one next to it. The more they fell, the more they accumulated? There was power in numbers, enough to shut down an entire city.</p><p>"Twenty-two inches. So not quite two feet. What's your biggest?" Rio questioned back, leaning forward on her elbows in interest.</p><p>Once again, the meals seemed to be of little value in comparison to the conversation that was at hand.</p><p>"Well, when I lived in a small town just outside of here, it was three feet. When I lived in Reykjavik, it was twelve."</p><p>"Twelve feet?!" Rio managed back, her eyes wide. That almost seemed impossible; trying to think of just how much snow that was? Agatha could see as it failed to visualize in Rio's mind, but she was still struck with wonder. "Did you just not leave for a week?"</p><p>Agatha gave a gentle shrug as she leaned forward, deciding that she was going to wrap her sandwich and take it home with her.</p><p>"I was smart enough to get groceries and supplies beforehand."</p><p>As she actually started to fold the paper up, though, she could see just beneath her lid as Rio visibly deflated. Agatha finished her work and then lifted her head, recognizing the look on Rio's face.</p><p>"I was going to say that I'm not leaving, but... I kind of would like to get out of here. Did you.. have plans for the rest of your day?" Agatha tried to hide it, tried to choke it down, but that undeniable hope seemed to fill her voice.</p><p>"I need to go pick up a couple of books for Julia. That's actually where I was headed when I started texting you. But... maybe there's some books of poetry you haven't yet read?" Rio posed back, something between a smirk and a grin filling her face, like she couldn't decide which one she wanted more.</p><p>"If that's your way of asking if I'll accompany you to the bookstore..." Agatha said back, her eyes scrutinizing Rio's expression for any waver, any sign that it was not what was happening, but Rio's facade was cool and steely aside from that lightness in those dark honey eyes. "I suppose I will."</p><p>Rio wanted to break, to smile, but she didn't. Instead, all she offered was a quirked eyebrow. "Maybe, if I'm lucky, you'll let me buy you a cup of coffee, too. You know, friendship and all."</p><p>"Oh <i>Doctor Rio</i>, are you asking me on a coffee date so soon?"</p><p>Rio shrugged, a hand raising to absentmindedly fiddle with the petals of the snapdragon in her hair.</p><p>"That depends."</p><p>"On?" Agatha questioned, her expression wanting for indulgence.</p><p>"It depends on how badly you want it to be one." Like a whip, a flash of light shot across Rio's gaze and her mischeivous smirk was instant.</p><p>
<i>Damn her.</i>

<p>Although it was an active battle, Agatha was trying to keep that crumbling exterior completely placid as she held the door open for the doctor -- <i>Rio</i> -- as they made their way out of the deli. This woman was clearly trying to push every button she had, and while it was working in its own way, it was also beginning to stir something else in her.</p><p>For as much of a pain as Rio was playing up to be, Agatha knew that she didn't want it to end. Hell, she was pretty sure that she would have let her play her games and poke and prod to her heart's content if that meant that they were still in one another's company.</p><p>A plastic sack dangled from each of their fingers as they appeared back out in the blustery November day -- the last of it's kind before December woke up the next morning -- the wind whipping hard enough that for a moment, Agatha had thought that it was going to pluck that snapdragon right from Rio's hair. Agatha's hand shot up in an attempt to cup it and protect it from being carried away.</p><p>The movement caught Rio's eye, and her head had whipped around to find the commotion, but instead found Agatha looking a little... guilty?</p><p>"I... Sorry. I thought it was going to blow away," she offered, though it didn't seem to decrease the heat that had suddenly wrapped itself around her neck beneath her scarf. Her eyes fell back to the flower again and her lips twisted in thought. "Why even bother with it? The flower, I mean. It's more likely that not that it wouldn't make it through a winter day like this one..."</p><p>Despite the fact that they were still walking, with Agatha half a step behind Rio's to her left, Rio's laugh that projected forward held still in the air, leaving Agatha to walk right through it a second later.</p><p>That was a really nice sound, even if Rio was laughing at <i>her.</i></p><p>"Why smell the roses? Why dance in the rain? Do the things we do always have to make sense for them to bring us joy?" Rio posed, her head turned just enough so that her voice carried back to its intended target.</p><p><i>Okay,</i> Agatha thought to herself, <i>that was pretty poetic.</i></p><p>"What I do for work could easily leave me jaded as fuck, and while people give some thought to that, they really don't realize the extent of it." For a moment, the sound of her voice was gone and was replaced by the noise of the moving city around them. They had been out of step up until that moment, Rio's gait slowing for the briefest moment so that they were suddenly side by side and the conversation was a little easier to hold. "I guess seeing two of the people I care about most covered in blood with broken bones brought a little more darkness into my life than I was comfortable with."</p><p>Agatha was listening, but she was also feeling. Sure, it wasn't the same, but Agatha knew those clouds, knew that kind of darkness, even on a deeper level than Rio was asserting for this instance. She knew that Rio saw death; it was an occupational hazard, something that she couldn't avoid in the line of work she had chosen to pursue.</p><p>In that second, Agatha fought and won a battle within herself, the one that had almost just blurted out the question: 'Then why do you do it?'</p><p>It would have been insensitive, and it would have completely discredited all of the painstaking hard work Rio had poured into learning the skills she needed to be able to save lives in the times that she could. It was an honorable profession, and one Agatha imagined had to be left at the exit doors to that hospital more often than not.</p><p>Rio had not left the memory of Agatha in that hospital, though. Rio had been carrying that one around for weeks.</p><p>Agatha, who had not been paying attention to where they were, did part her lips in question, though it was substantially less pointed than the one she had almost asked.</p><p>"Why did you decide to go into medicine?" she asked, but Rio stopped. Agatha had not noticed at first and kept walking, but as she looked over for the answer, she was met with empty space. Her head whipped back and Rio stood at the entrance to the book store, the knob of the door in her hand as she held it open expectantly. There was a grin on her face as she took in the sight of Agatha who had initially looked a little stunned.</p><p>Though she tried to hide it, the way Agatha flipped her hair out of her face as a result of the wind and her sudden turn, it disclosed how flustered she had felt for the brief moment it had taken her to compose herself. She was embarrassed that she had been so absorbed in the idea of learning more about this woman that she had been completely oblivious to their surroundings.</p><p>What was it about Rio that seemed to distract her and make her lose sight of where it was she was headed, at any given moment? Somehow, her intentions of grabbing a quick lunch and heading home to bury herself in a good book had been completely upended by an incredibly intelligent woman who hadn't been smart enough to check where she had been walking.</p><p>The smartest people could do the stupidest things.</p><p>After another breath, Agatha's feet began to move, carrying her back toward the awaiting Rio, who was still holding the door with a smile on her face that both warmed Agatha and somehow found a way to irritate her.</p><p>The irritation was mainly stemming from her frustration. How had this woman spent the last two weeks silent as stone, leaving Agatha wondering if she had hallucinated the entire interaction between the two of them at the hospital, and now? Now, she stood there as though she were some little pocket of sunshine that had dropped in its warmth right into a snowy and cold Boston winter.</p><p>It was pissing her off but only because it was something she had wanted so badly before only to be met with dead air for far too long.</p><p>What if the two of them spent this time together and Agatha formed even more of an attachment than she had the night Rio had set at her bedside eating a popsicle? That had felt dangerous even then, and now, it felt like Agatha was staring at the fire, her hand inching closer to it as though she were going to shove it right in the heart of the wild flames.</p><p>That was what this felt like.</p><p>Entertaining Rio felt like playing with fire, and while Agatha could be reckless?</p><p>Her loneliness could not take another two weeks of silence between the two of them. She'd been in the dark for so long, and there Rio was, dangling over her head like every bit of illumination she might need to be able to see her life any clearer. Agatha had always thrived in the darkness; it was where she did her best work. That kind of darkness was not a place that was meant to be inhabited, though, and she had taken up residence anyway.</p><p>Now, there was a crack in the exterior and Rio's light was starting to pour in.</p><p>Agatha wanted to seal it up, to not risk the chance of feeling what warmth that light might bring if she stepped into it. Her hesitance was justified in her own mind because she was protecting herself from the inevitability that she would wind up in that townhome by herself as seemed to be commonplace.</p><p>If she really looked herself in the face and asked herself <i>why</i> no one ever seemed to stay?</p><p>She pushed them away. The minute she felt someone getting too close, close enough to see her for all that she really was? She lashed out, she pushed back and she made it so that they wouldn't consider coming back.</p><p>As much as she hated the isolation, the idea of someone choosing to leave and continuing to stay gone was a pain she could never brace herself to endure. When it was her choice, when she made that decision to lash out to ensure she couldn't be left first? That was a power she could hold onto, a sense of control that she could cling to in order to try and convince herself that she had any kind of a solid standing in her own life.</p><p>She spent hours of the night pouring the depths of her loneliness and sorrow onto pages illuminated by candles, the silence laying steadily against the baseboards from one side of the home to the other.</p><p>Or, that was what she had been doing most of her life.</p><p>For the seven or eight days after she had been released from the hospital? If anyone who had ever known her would have looked at those poems? It would have been obvious that something in her life had changed, that she had been offered a new perspective. It had only lasted that week before the drivel of her despair seemed to fill the pages instead.</p><p>The last week's worth of poems reflected disappointment and hurt in a way her work had never displayed before. She had tried to write out her feelings, but instead she had stewed and pined for a woman that probably no longer even remembered her name.</p><p>Agatha felt like a complete idiot. It had been so incredibly long since she had ever even considered the idea of letting her take to another person without a thorough vetting of who she thought they might be. However, she knew very little about Rio outside of what she had learned over their uneaten meal but still walked into that bookstore with a disgruntled 'thank you' passing through her lips.</p><p>The ringing of the bell behind them signified that the door had closed behind Rio and although Agatha had paced forward to be among the shelves, Rio nearly breezed right by her. She knew exactly where she was headed. Agatha balked for only a moment before she willed herself to action and followed behind her, not concerned with any desire she may have had to peruse at her own leisure.</p><p>Agatha's interest was piqued as she watched Rio glide her way around the store. She began to wind in and out of different shelves as she scanned the spines with a lightning quick precision, leaving Agatha wondering just how she could possibly be actually reading what they said.</p><p>Her own head had turned, following the same view that Rio had just ahead of her. She was so transfixed by what she was looking at that she had been completely unaware as the other woman came to a halt in front of her, having found what she was looking for.</p><p>Instantly, Agatha ran directly into her back, hands flying up to catch hold of Rio's biceps to keep her from falling forward from the force of the contact.</p><p><i>"Shit, I'm sorry,"</i> she pushed in a rush, her voice low due to their proximity and her desire to not make a scene.</p><p>For a split second, Agatha could have sworn that Rio <i>leaned back into the touch.</i></p><p>In the next moment as Agatha prepared to support her weight, it was gone and Rio was steady on her feet again. It shouldn't have,  but it caused the sharpest thrum of yearning to strike her in the chest. It had not been all that long since Agatha had shared in the physicality of fucking around, but it had been decades since she had let herself feel affection for another person.</p><p>
<i>Ew. Was this what affection felt like now?</i>
</p><p>Agatha decided in that moment that she hated it. This was the second time her hands had been on Rio's arms that day, and each touch sent sparks over her skin in uncomfortable ways. The real discomfort came from the reality that Agatha knew she felt drawn to the good doctor and yet, she was resisting every step of the way for no other reason than self-preservation.</p><p>Another beat and Agatha realized her fingers were still curled around each of Rio's biceps and she let go in a flash, taking a step back. Rio's head turned, chin hovering over her shoulder.</p><p>She had a remarkable profile, but when that... smile? Smirk? Grin? When it crossed her face, only half of it visible to Agatha, she could feel as her chest tightened and she was actively trying to will the breath out of her lungs.</p><p>This was driving her insane. It was literally making her feel like no thought she had was a reasonable one. There was no way that she was standing there, half a step behind the doctor that she had literally forced herself to stop thinking about to salvage her own sanity.</p><p>Ever so casually, Rio turned to her right and reached forward, using the tip of her forefinger to snag on the lip of the cover to the book she had been looking for. The orange and blue cover became visible as she pulled it off of the shelf, turning it front side up in her palms. The words 'ANXIOUS PEOPLE' were scrawled across the front over the illustrations. Rio let it weigh in her hands as her eyes flickered up again, scanning the shelf in front of her to see if the other novel she was searching for was there as well, but her nose wrinkled slightly with her disappointment.</p><p>As she turned back toward where she had been headed, she held the book up over her shoulder, turning her head to cast her voice back to Agatha.</p><p>"Have you ever read this one?" she offered, those velvet tones light in their inquiry.</p><p>"I haven't. Is it any good?"</p><p>"It's pretty chaotic, but it's an interesting read. Good plot, engaging dialogue. I'd recommend it." This entire demeanor that Rio carried around was so difficult to parse, so hard to make sense of. She wanted to pick it apart, to make it fit some sane narrative in her mind. She was failing, though. It was almost a sense of her being so damn... aloof?</p><p>And there was Agatha, following her through that bookstore like she was little more than a lost puppy looking for someone to show her the way.</p><p>As Rio halted again, though, Agatha had been far enough behind that she hadn't smacked right into her this time. Her own feet planted and she watched in interest as Rio's eyes scanned over the shelf next to her, seeing exactly what she wanted. She reached up and with ease, pulled the new book off the shelf and into her hand on top of the other one.</p><p>This one, Agatha did recognize.</p><p>"Harlan Coben, hm? For you or for your friend?" she posed as Rio glanced down at the copy of 'The Five' in her possession.</p><p>"This one's for me. I lost my old copy. It's... actually one of my favorite books." She had turned, now, so that they were facing one another and Agatha was back into that processing mode where she was doing what she could to understand what the hell she was doing there and why she was so quick to disregard her own plans for her day to get just a few more minutes of Rio's time.</p><p>Agatha had standards for herself and she had a strict understanding that she was in control of her own choices and actions.</p><p>But was she really?</p><p>Since the moment she had spotted Rio before she had even known it was her, she'd been compelled by outside forces to reach out or try to pull her back.</p><p>That had been one thing, but looking at both phones to realize that Rio had not been lying to her when she had insisted Agatha was the one who she was texting had been something else entirely. Thinking about it again thawed some of that hard freeze that Agatha was trying to maintain.</p><p>For as much as Rio was annoying her, maybe there had been honesty in her admission that she truly was just trying to get to know Agatha. It was the first time anyone had ever said anything like that to her and instead of embracing it and seeing it as genuine, Agatha had been quick to throw up her defenses, to try and protect herself from someone she had no reason to trust yet.</p><p>"It's a good read. I'm not a huge fan of a lot of his stuff, but that's a good one. The character building is usually a little lackluster for him, but this one was his chance to really shine. But..." Agatha cut herself off, realizing that there was no need for her to keep rattling off things she liked about it, as if she were trying to convince Rio it was a good choice. "You've already read it," she added, a wry smile twisting its way onto her lips.</p><p>Rio tipped her head back toward the rear end of the store. "Come on," she requested, moving to hold her books in both hands as she turned around and headed toward where she had motioned. As Agatha followed, she realized where Rio was leading them -- the poetry section -- and her eyes subconsciously narrowed at the back of Rio's head.</p><p>She did not seem the slightest bit bothered as she slipped into the corner, eyes scanning the shelves for what she was searching for. Finally, almost all the way in the corner, she stopped and reached for a book on the top shelf and pulled it down, adding it to her stack.</p><p>Agatha, who was about a foot and a half away let her eyes drop to the cover, which was black with white script across it: 'The Wild Fox of Yemen.' It was one she had been meaning to pick up, but she'd been buried in her own musings too often to be able to delve into someone else's. There were certain times when she would find that ability, to spend hours upon hours reading poetry while she sipped at her coffee, her glasses occasionally slipping down the slope of her nose.</p><p>"And who's that one for?" Agatha posed, though her tone was skeptical. Was Rio going to admit that she was buying it for herself so that she could try to impress Agatha, or even melt a bit more of the iceberg she was trying to put off that she was?</p><p>"It's for you," Rio answered simply and turned ninety degrees and headed straight toward Agatha.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha froze. There were a couple of things that weren't processing: 1) Had Rio really just admitted that she was buying Agatha a book of poetry just over an hour after they'd officially met? 2) The way Rio was headed right for her? There was an intention in her step, like she was coming close to tell her a secret, like there was something she wanted Agatha to know.</p><p>And then, just like that, she brushed right by with the lightest contact of the coats that were still around their frames. Visibly, though Rio was behind her, Agatha deflated. She realized in that moment that she had been anticipating, that she had thought that Rio was going to be a bit bolder after the admission she'd just made about the book.</p><p>"B-but!" Agatha managed, tumbling back into the moment as she blinked the shattered hope out of her eyes. "How do you know I haven't read it?" The question was pointed, perhaps even a little sharp, but it was only in defense because she was scrambling to make sense of something that seemed to illogical.</p><p>Rio had reached the register and slid the books across to the cashier as Agatha approached, her expression still pinched in confusion.</p><p>"I don't <i>know,</i>" Rio admitted as the soft beep of the books being scanned sounded around them. "But I took an educated guess by the look on your face when you saw it was what I pulled."</p><p>For a moment outside of space and time, Agatha was in the ultimate conflict with herself. What Rio was doing, what she was saying? She was being kind, she was even going so far as to be sweet. They were facets of the human existence that Agatha did not have much experience with and so, as a result, she had thrown up her walls.</p><p>What she was realizing as Rio handed over her credit card to purchase the books without another word said about it, was that she hadn't really needed to. Rio was being genuine, she was being thoughtful and considerate. Perhaps in some ways, it was her way of apologizing about the way this entire meeting had come to be.</p><p>The cashier handed over the bag to her and she thanked him sweetly before her dark honey gaze swept over to Agatha in question. "So..."</p><p>Agatha was still fighting with herself, but as Rio spoke, she honed back in to give her the attention she was requesting.</p><p>"So?" Agatha asked, though it wasn't defensive, wasn't sharp or used as a shield. It was a gentle probing, a way of getting Rio to keep going with whatever wild thing was about to come out of her mouth next.</p><p>She did not disappoint.</p><p>"Have you given it anymore thought?" she questioned, but when Agatha's eyes clouded over with her lack of understanding, Rio's head tilted to the side like an adorable puppy. "Would you like to join me for a coffee date?"</p><p>Agatha blinked at her for just a few moments, trying to integrate what the fuck this woman was doing into her ability to think clearly. They were pretty contradictory; once again she found herself in a battle of wills where she was genuinely lost on which answer was the right one. Instead, Agatha did what she did best: She focused on the words.</p><p>Her expression was still smooth, not interrogatory or harsh, but bordering on a little lost.</p><p>"You've used that word twice now," Agatha pointed, though they had not moved much from their position toward the front of the store.</p><p>"Coffee?" Rio posed back innocently, her brows raising in question.</p><p>Agatha scoffed, rolling her eyes. This was ridiculous and she was not sure why she had entertained it this long.</p><p>"I'm just going to go home," Agatha grumbled, shoving her hands in her pockets as she began to push past where Rio stood, but it was Rio's hand that caught her arm this time. It stilled her, compelling her to look up at Rio even if only by a half an inch.</p><p>"Go on a date with me, Agatha," Rio beguiled, her tone more empty of any other motives than her genuine request than Agatha had thought it might be.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to speak, with every intent on asking why she should, but her posture slackened a little and she beheld Rio with a curious gaze.</p><p>"Why do you want to go on a date with me, Rio?" she asked instead. It was more than just a desire for knowledge; Agatha <i>needed</i> to hear that someone wanted her around.</p><p>Rio seemed to read this, but she was quiet for a moment as she chose her words.</p><p>"Because since the moment we met, and you told me you had no one to call... Some disembodied voice belonging to the universe told me that if nothing else, I could be that someone for you, in whatever way." Rio's eyes lifted to Agatha's own and the genuine softness she saw there? Rio wasn't making this up, even if it did sound insane. Before she could interject, though, Rio kept going. "So... I offered you friendship. And that's great and still a totally viable option, but..."</p><p>This time, Rio's eyes fell down to the bag in her hand and she lifted it so she could take the book of poetry out of it. She looked down at it and then held it out for Agatha to take.</p><p>"You've been sneaking me crumbs of a person I am certain the world has never met... Maybe you've only met her on occasion, but she showed herself today, I think. And... I'd really like it if you gave me a chance to get to know her a little more."</p><p>Agatha's eyes flickered down to the book and back up to Rio, her brow pinched in a clear effort to not show that she was struggling to place the way those words were making her feel. It was a new emotion, one that was making her stomach feel like it was filled with molten lava. It was a feeling that was making each and every cervical vertebrae flare with a warmth that she realized was a mix between flattery and embarrassment.</p><p>Her lips twisted and worried, though after a moment, her brow seemed to smooth out. The rest of her expression followed suit, though her mouth turned down at the corners for a moment.</p><p>"I don't want you to ask because you feel bad," Agatha said carefully, eyeing the woman before her, whose aura had not once shifted from warm and kind since the moment they'd walked into the deli.</p><p>"I'm not," Rio assured her, but she could sense that honesty was going to be the best course here. "I'm asking you because I walked out of your room that night and I laid in bed until four in the morning thinking about you. I thought about how sweet it was, what you said, even though I knew it was a result of the injury. But... then I made a snap call and came back, and you pushed again. That's... more initiative from any human I've ever seen since I was in med school."</p><p>Rio's eyes landed down at the book that was still in her hand, and then landed directly into Agatha's.</p><p>"I let work pull me under, and I can never apologize to you enough if I made you feel any sort of negative way because of it. It had nothing to do with you and everything to do with my inability to balance the chaos in my life. So... If you'd be willing to hit the 'reset' button, I'd like to start it over right by taking you out on a date, even if all you're comfortable with right now is coffee."</p><p>Agatha's throat felt tight, like it was swelling and closing to a point where she was actively fighting for air.</p><p><i>No one </i><b>ever</b> talked to Agatha like that.</p><p>For as much as it was in her nature to dispute, to argue and disprove?</p><p>She didn't want to this time.</p><p>She wanted to believe Rio when she said those words, the earnestly gentle tone of her voice selling just how genuine she was being.</p><p>Agatha reached out and gently took the book from Rio's grasp, looking down at it for a moment as her eyes scanned the cover, and even deeper than that, the sentiment.</p><p>She lifted her head, her blue eyes finding dark ones in the space between them.</p><p>Her lips curved up the slightest bit and she gave a gentle nod.</p><p>"Alright," she conceded, her smile growing a little warmer. "But only because you really have a way with words."</p>

<p>For being the morose and lonely poet that Agatha was, there was something electric that buzzed around her as she stepped out onto the sidewalk behind Rio, the question she posed a little pointed, but there was a teasing ring to it.</p><p>"So, where do <i>you</i> get your coffee in this city?" Agatha's lips curled, watching as Rio turned to face her.</p><p>Rio's expression was a little smug, as if she knew that what she was about to say was going to light a match under her.</p><p>"Typically, I don't. I do have a rather large stock of Stok in my fridge at home, though. I was spending copious amounts of money at Dunkin' to a point where I was considering filing for bankruptcy." Rio's warm smile morphed into something more of an enticing grin. "Why, Agatha? Where do you get coffee in this city?"</p><p>"I don't," she responded back, a mischievous twinkle flaring in her eyes. "I prefer tea."</p><p>Rio breathed a huff of a laugh, the expression on her face reading that she should not have been surprised by such a response, even though Agatha had very obviously agreed to a coffee date. The semantics were there, sure, and Agatha truly didn't mean to deter from the intention behind the offer, but she also was beginning to realize that she could show her claws in a way that could be perceived as playful as opposed to aggressive.</p><p>"How very 'tortured writer' of you," Rio shot back, and while she didn't know it, that touched a sore spot.</p><p>It shouldn't have, and Agatha knew it. She knew that there was no intention there aside from making a sly joke with the knowledge Rio had. It hadn't been a dig or a jab, just a gentle poke of fun that stuck right into a large and sore bruise. It was a bruise that Agatha had carried with her for years. It wasn't anyone else's fault that she did a good job at covering it up.</p><p>"So... Are we just going to stand here and have an hours long discussion centered around coffee versus tea, or are you going to take me on our <i>date?</i>" Agatha questioned, shoving her hands in her coat pockets awkwardly in the way that she still had a hold on the bag that had her sandwich, and now her new book, inside.</p><p>The hot flash of electricity that lasted all of two seconds in Rio's eyes made Agatha's stomach twist, which only seemed to be mirrored in the smile that brought itself upon her face.</p><p>"You know, the way you say it like that, it's almost like you don't believe that we're going on a date," Rio returned, raising an eyebrow in pointed interrogation, although she had not asked a question.</p><p>Agatha's eyes dropped to Rio's shoes -- dark green Doc Martens with golden stitching -- as she tried to find the right words. Slowly, they raised again, nearly getting lost in those dark eyes that shone even in the dim light of the overcast day above them.</p><p>"It just... The nuance is a little lacking?" Agatha posed, though she realized it could have sounded like an accusation. "Not your fault, just that we grabbed a meal a--"</p><p>"As friends," Rio countered, tilting her head in challenge. It was clear to Agatha that Rio was actively sinking in the effort to try and make sure that Agatha knew where her interest truly was.</p><p>"Right. But. That was like... an hour ago," Agatha pointed out, wanting to put on display that it had taken only that amount of time for Rio to want to shift gears.</p><p>And then it hit her: <i>It had only taken an hour for Rio's interest to grow to a point where not asking Agatha out had not been an option.</i></p><p>Well, if that wasn't a prime example of looking at something through more than one lens, Agatha didn't know what was.</p><p>"Fine," Rio stated, her eyes lifting down the street as she folded her own arms, though it wasn't a defensive or rigid gesture. "How about... We part ways," she offered, and Agatha could feel the panic as it began to pulse in her chest. She did not realize that Rio had not finished talking. "You go home, I go home. We change, we get ready, and then you meet me at Brick &amp; Mortar at... 7:30?" she offered as she checked the smart watch on her wrist for the time.</p><p>Those eyes lifted again and Agatha felt... frozen.</p><p>The ease with which Rio spoke, the calculation that went into the selection of every single word she used... It was kind of <i>hot.</i> She didn't need a massive vocabulary when she seemed to understand how to point every single word she used not like a weapon, but -- funnily enough -- more like a scalpel. She was slowly finding ways to cut through Agatha's reinforced barriers and peel her back layer by layer.</p><p>She hardly knew this woman, so why did it feel like she was powerless to stop the flaying?</p><p>Realizing that the silence was ticking between them, Agatha startled back into the moment, her eyes never having left Rio's in her mindless stupor.</p><p>"You want me to meet you at a bar for a date?" Agatha repeated back stupidly, though she could tell that Rio realized it was more a voicing of her thoughts to cement them into reality than it was an interrogation of Rio herself.</p><p>"Yes, Agatha. And if you tell me you don't drink, I will not hesitate to call you a terrible poet before I figure out something else we can do." Those low, gravelly tones were so honest, so damn sincere that Agatha was truly trying to find a way to prove that this woman was real, that she was not actually just standing by the outer wall of the bookstore just having a conversation with a figment of her imagination.</p><p>"You really want this, don't you?" Agatha asked, though it had been hard to hide the skepticism in her voice.</p><p>"I do," Rio answered simply. "And before you ask why, I've already told you. But... I'll add that while the heft of my interest is in getting to know you, I also am a little thrilled with the idea that I'd get to walk into the bar and sit next to someone as beautiful as you are." Rio's words weren't sharp, but they had points on the ends, as if she was making sure she was understood. "And I've only ever seen you in a hospital gown and that coat, which... Sad to say, but you might need a new one after your accident. It's... seen better days, I'm sure."</p><p>Agatha could feel it, the way her resolves were slipping the longer that Rio went on.</p><p>
<i>Damn her, she was good.</i>
</p><p>She was so... charming?  Was that even the right word? She had this air of mystery, and yet Agatha still had no reason to believe that Rio hadn't been genuine during any minute of their interaction. It wasn't even in a supercilious kind of way, but she just kept pulling these strings. While Agatha had been confused on what marionette she was puppeteering, it seemed to smack into her in the same way she had nearly run Rio right over.</p><p>
<i>Agatha was the fucking puppet.</i>
</p><p>And Rio was somehow getting her to do <i>everything</i> she wanted, but not because she was forcing Agatha's hand. No, Rio was laying out the treasure map, indicating exactly where to go for a promised loot, and never once looking away from that dead stare into Agatha's fucking soul. She was showing Agatha exactly the right way to go in order to find the treasure she was promising, Agatha just had to make the choice to follow it.</p><p>"You know that your charm almost comes across as arrogance, right?" Agatha finally fired at her, though the grin her words caused? Agatha was really beginning to grow frustrated with how her breath would lodge in her throat every single time that happened.</p><p>"Would an arrogant woman stand outside on a cold winter day trying to convince you to take a risk and leave your pen and paper to rest for the night?"</p><p>At this, Agatha finally folded. All those words she used, all of those quips she made and that was the string of them that caused her posture to slump. The bag hooked around her fingers swung a little as she rocked forward onto the balls of her feet, exhaling a resigned sigh.</p><p>"Okay, Rio," she finally voiced.</p><p>"Really?" Rio asked back, and Agatha was actually shocked at how surprised she sounded. This had been her plan the entire time, so why did she finally seemed jilted that Agatha had finally agreed?</p><p>Agatha nodded her head, only twice, but she hadn't looked away.</p><p>"You sound surprised," she finally decided to point out, but Rio did not balk as that suave smile split her lips again, those dark eyes shimmering in accomplishment.</p><p>"I didn't doubt my ability to be convincing, but I did doubt that you'd get all of the locks on the door of your willpower undone before I came to the conclusion that I was just wasting your time."</p><p>
<i>What the fuck. Where had this woman come from?</i>
</p><p>Agatha simply blinked at her for a moment. Rio was so sure, so confident in the skin she wore, as if there had just never been a doubt in her mind that she could win Agatha over. It was unnerving and truthfully, it was making Agatha squirm, which was where the well of her hesitation had formed.</p><p>Agatha straightened back up, clearing her throat as she tried to ignore the bite of the cold on the tip of her nose that she could almost see had changed to a soft pink color.</p><p>"So, Brick &amp; Mortar at 7:30 then?" Agatha asked, a little more strength in her tone than she'd been able to manage the majority of the rest of the day.</p><p>Rio gave one sure nod of her head. "There's not a dress-code, but I like playing make-believe for a couple of hours, so do with that information what you will."</p><p>Agatha's eyes narrowed slightly; that wasn't a whole lot to go off of, but she was aware that just enough had been stated that she had been given some directive of what was expected of her. She was struggling to keep up with this woman; it was rare that someone could ever keep Agatha on her toes, but Rio?</p><p>Rio felt like holding her hand over the stove, waiting until it got hot enough to burn.</p><p>Agatha had felt little pain since the numbness had completely taken her over fifteen years before. Something in that moment wanted to feel the heat.</p><p>"I will do with that what I shall, and I shall then see you at 7:30 sharp on the front step of a bar I am willing to bet you haven't been in for quite some time."</p><p>Rio simply shrugged, that mega-watt smile still plastered to her face.</p><p>"I see little wrong in doing things that make us uncomfortable," she voiced, her cadence so calm and measured.</p><p>This hit Agatha straight through the heart.</p><p>Agatha, who had isolated because she didn't know how to play nice.</p><p>Agatha, who had moved through the world relentlessly to keep from slowing down.</p><p>Agatha, who had avoided uncomfortable situations for fear that her reactions might not be able to be tempered if things went wrong.</p><p>She looked at Rio, wondering what was going to end up being the one thing that would send her running for the hills.</p><p>Rio, who began to move, taking steps across the space between them.</p><p>Rio, who got close enough that their coats brushed again.</p><p>Rio, who deliberately leaned in and graced the apple of Agatha's cheek with the softest brush of her lips and then murmured in her ear.</p><p>
<i>"I'll see you at 7:30."</i>
</p><p>And then, just like that, she was gone. Even as Agatha whipped around after a stunned moment, Rio had somehow managed to disappear into the throngs of people who crowded the sidewalk, not even a glimpse of pink from the snapdragon in her hair to be seen.</p><p>This time, even though Agatha was alone, she knew it was only temporary. That was more than enough to compel her to move her feet and find her way back home.</p><p>*****</p><p>The internal monologue that had been raging on inside of Agatha since she had finally made her way back to the townhouse had been pretty loud. It was a heavy back and forth of wanting to just call it off or try to find a way to stop being so miserable so she just enjoy herself.</p><p>Even if she wanted to bail, the only way to do that would be to ghost the other woman, and with the way they'd come to this point?</p><p>Even as wary as Agatha had become over the course of the day, she still wouldn't have chosen to not show up. That wasn't fair. Plus, wasn't it the whole reason she'd been so indignant in the first place? Rio had... hurt her feelings?</p><p>The mere thought made Agatha want to curl up into herself and simply disappear. She didn't tend to mere matters like feelings; her isolation had seen to that.</p><p>Yet, she wrote poetry.</p><p>So perhaps not tending to feelings was a lie she had told herself when it pertained to the inner workings of intrapersonal relationships.</p><p>As her thumb pressed down on the plastic handle of the curling iron to release the strand of hair in its hold, Agatha's eyes lifted to her own reflection in the mirror. What she saw was almost unrecognizable. Gone were the glasses that she donned like protective wear when she was teaching. The dark circles under her eyes had been concealed with just enough makeup. There was also a light dusting to her cheeks that was in no way natural.</p><p>It was a very rare occurrence for Agatha to look in a mirror and see that kind of reflection staring right back at her.</p><p>Rio had called her <i>beautiful. </i></p><p>Physically, Agatha may have been able to admit that she could agree. But the way Rio had said it? She wasn't just talking about what Agatha looked like, and that was the part she seemed to be wrestling with the most.</p><p>This bright, sunny healer was engaging so deeply and proving that she was willing to go after what she wanted. Yet, all Agatha could think was that she wanted it so badly, but not enough to risk damaging another human in the process with just how sharp her edges had come to be. She had been convinced after their first meeting, and after hoping for so long that the doctor would reach out, that she could make this work, that it could be something she wanted.</p><p>The silence had nipped that in the bud pretty quickly, but she was trying to recover from that.</p><p>With how quickly their day had evolved, however, Agatha had simply battened down the hatches and solidified every single defense she had.</p><p>Her immediate wave of dissatisfaction at seeing who she had grabbed had been washed away in their conversation, but the more time they spent together, the more Rio seemed to pinpoint Agatha's weak spots. She didn't even hesitate to dig right in the more Agatha steeled.</p><p>It was idiotic; she <i>wanted</i> this. She'd wanted this for two weeks.</p><p>So what was the fucking problem?</p><p>The problem, Agatha realized, was that Rio was doing literally every single thing Agatha had hoped she would. The problem continued with the fact that Agatha had never thought she would, so once she started? The idea that it could be fabricated or masking ulterior motives made her stomach churn. Even though she had no reason to even think that Rio would behave that way based on any encounter they'd had, she had still tried to fortify.</p><p>As she stared into her own blue eyes, she made a silent agreement with herself: The thorns came off for the rest of the night. She was going to remember what it meant to be interested in someone and not be terrified that they were going to find a way to hurt her at the first opportunity they had. She was going to engage, and she was <i>not</i> going to keep burying the pieces of herself that this woman seemed so interested in.</p><p>She met herself evenly, straightened up and shook her shoulders all the way down to the tips of her fingers, as if channeling the nerves right out through her palms.</p><p>She could do this.</p><p>She could go and sit at a bar next to the most beautiful woman she'd laid eyes on and have a few drinks.</p><p>And maybe, in the process, she could stop being such a bitch about the fact that someone was being kind enough to show her attention, no matter how undeserving of it she felt herself to be.</p><p>Agatha paced back into her bedroom and picked up the suit jacket that she had laid across the bed while she had finished her make-up and hair. It was the same material as the skirt that hugged her hips and cut off just above her knees, both black in color. There was a cream blouse hugging her chest and as she slid the jacket on and took in the view of herself in the full-body mirror?</p><p><i>Holy shit.</i> She thought to herself. <i>I don't clean up too bad after all.</i></p><p>This was the Agatha that Rio had seen, the one she called beautiful.</p><p>This was the Agatha who could hold her head high and forget about her own problems with a couple of old fashioneds under her belt.</p><p>This was the Agatha that was going to have a good time on her date with the gorgeous doctor.</p><p>Not just any doctor.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>If it was the last thing she did, Agatha was going to have a damn good time with Rio.</p><p>For as little as those mental pep-talks had worked before, there was this determination within her that had suddenly rooted and was beginning to grow. She could feel it roll through her limbs like a dull warmth, like it was fuel.</p><p>And so, despite the freezing temperatures outside, she had grabbed her clutch, put on a peacoat instead of the nearly destroyed duffel one and set out. She slid into the Uber that had arrived, her hands finding her hair to try and keep the loose curls in place. She could already feel the bite of the evening air, even as the car door slammed shut behind her, but she still felt somehow warm, oddly enough.</p><p>It was the courage, the building of resolve to just go out and have some kind of fun for one night in her life.</p><p>It had taken but a few minutes for the car to arrive at the bar Rio had suggested earlier in the day and although Agatha's knuckles were nearly white from the exertion of her grip on her clutch, she still somehow felt ready.</p><p>The settings around the windows were a dark teal and in a sharp contrast of color, the two front doors were a damn near lime green. The lights were warm and dim through the windows and from the outside, it looked pretty cozy.</p><p>Maybe Rio actually did know what she was doing.</p><p>Agatha had stepped out of the car and shut the door behind her, the cold wind whipping around her stockinged legs as it caused a shiver to rip up her spine. She had been torn for a moment, wondering if she should go inside or if she should wait for Rio to show, but before she could make the choice herself, she heard her name.</p><p>"Agatha!"</p><p>The sound itself was both delighted and delightful as it hit Agatha's ears. Her head turned, her eyes lifting and what she saw?</p><p>She about choked.</p><p>Striding toward her with a thicker coat folded over her arm was Rio who looked... <i>séduisant.</i></p><p>Agatha blinked for just a moment, shaking the way her mind had devolved quickly to instead survey her, to take her in.</p><p>She was dressed so sharply in a fitted black suit that was cinched in all of the right places, the lapel trimmed in a dark green shade that lined the defining points of her suit jacket. Agatha noticed that the hem of her pants legs bore the same trim. A blouse of the same color as the trim laid beneath the jacket but was only buttoned up to the center of her chest, opening up to reveal the tanned skin of her sternum and the small silver locket that hung there.</p><p>As Agatha's eyes reached above Rio's shoulders, she almost wanted to melt on the spot even though it was below twenty degrees outside.</p><p>Agatha had always thought that Rio was beautiful from the moment she'd set disoriented eyes on her, but right then?</p><p>Rio was a goddamn heartstopper.</p><p>Her hair on one side was was pulled back and pinned, the pin of which also held secure a lone flower, but this time it was a bittersweet nightshade and soft purple in color.</p><p>Agatha's favorite color was purple.</p><p>There was no way Rio could have known that.</p><p>Agatha turned to face her as she approached and for a moment, she was a little frazzled in her own approach. Did she hug her? Did she shake her hand? The timeline of the way things were unfolding had left her second guessing herself more than she had thought she might. Still, as Rio got even closer, crossing into an invisible bubble of Agatha's personal space, Agatha's arms opened in a friendly hug.</p><p>"You look incredible," Agatha assured her as she released the embrace to look the other woman over once more. "That suit... It's definitely very <i>you.</i>"</p><p>Agatha couldn't fight herself as her lips curled up at the corners in the warmest, most genuine smile that she had been able to muster in Rio's presence thus far. It seemed to only grow as Rio gently took hold of one side of Agatha's open coat to pull it back so that she could see Agatha's outfit, too.</p><p>At first, it had looked like Rio was grinning, but the longer Agatha watched her expression, the more that grin melted into something that was closer to a smirk than it wasn't. After just a second later, Rio dropped the fabric and met Agatha's eyes again, her dark gaze shimmering with the light of the city night in them.</p><p>"I almost didn't think you'd come," Rio admitted as she took a step back and flourished a hand, indicating that they could go inside where it was much warmer. If Agatha had to guess, Rio wanted to be comfortable if she was going to be engaging in a battle of wills with Agatha all night.</p><p>Agatha pulled the door open and held it for Rio, who passed right in front of her and left a scent in her trail that Agatha both could not identify and yet still immediately loved. The top notes almost smelled like pear and ginger, but there was something floral there, too, and even the hint of woodiness that she couldn't quite place.</p><p>Whatever it was? Rio smelled delicious.</p><p>Agatha was right behind her, savoring each moment she could pull such a comforting scent into her lungs. This time, as Rio stopped in front of her, Agatha had enough sense to stop herself, too. She looked up at the other woman who reached into her breast pocket to produce a small but functional wallet -- one Agatha had typically seen carried by men -- and plucked out her credit card. Before she stepped up to order, though, she turned to take in Agatha.</p><p>"So first," Rio stated, her eyes flicking back to the bar for just a moment, no doubt checking for the position of any empty stools before she made her plan. "Would you prefer a booth or to sit at the bar?"</p><p>While Agatha parted her lips to announce that she was nonplussed with either decision, she caught herself. Rio was asking her a question. Rio was asking her to make a decision. She could not just say she didn't care either way because it showed a lack of initiative, and Rio had been showering her with that in spades since that morning. It only seemed fair to reciprocate.</p><p>"The bar. That way we don't have to go far for refills," Agatha offered.</p><p>The surprised, yet somehow pleased, look that crossed Rio's features almost melted Agatha for a second time, even if it was a little warmer inside.</p><p>Rio gave a nod and stepped forward, reaching out to pull one of the stools away for Agatha who shucked and folded her coat over the back of it. Even though Agatha didn't voice it, it warmed something in her chest to be shown manners like that. Perhaps she had underestimated just how much of a true gentlewoman Rio could be. As Agatha took the seat on the stool Rio had pulled for her, Rio mirrored the action and slid onto a stool of her own.</p><p>The bartender approached them, sliding her hands on the bar top as she asked the two of them what they would like.</p><p>In a surge of bravery, Agatha was the first to place her request. "An old fashioned, please."</p><p>Rio's head cocked slightly as she took Agatha in studiously, eyes searching every inch of her face that was visible.</p><p>Agatha started to do that thing that Agatha never did.</p><p>She could feel heat blooming on her cheeks the longer Rio surveyed her. She was fucking <i>blushing.</i></p><p>"And for you, doll?" the bartender questioned, her eyes on Rio.</p><p>Rio wasn't paying attention, though. Rio was still absorbed in Agatha's profile.</p><p>"Oh my <i>god,</i>" Agatha breathed, beginning to feel embarrassed. "Would you just order a damn drink?!"</p><p>As she turned to look back at Rio, that flash of a smile was still visible even as she looked away, leaning on her arms over the bar as her eyes scanned the bottles of liquor, landing on the top shelf.</p><p>"A double of the Blanton's Special, please," she finally offered to which the bartender gave an understanding nod and set to work.</p><p>The moment she disappeared, Rio seemed to melt into the back of that stool, one arm hanging over the edge of the back, bent at the elbow with her hand folded over the top of it. Agatha could see that Rio had zeroed in on her, but she did not lift her head or otherwise move.</p><p>"What?" Agatha managed, though the heat of Rio's gaze was pulling on her lips, tugging them into a sheepish smile.</p><p>"I did not peg you to be an old fashioned drinker. I was expecting... I don't know, a martini?"</p><p>At this, Agatha finally turned to look at her, amusement clear in her eyes. "Gin tastes like drinking a Christmas tree. I'd sooner go chew on pine needles," she offered back haughtily, using the hand farthest from Rio to flip her hair back over her shoulder in some push of confidence.</p><p>"So, whiskey instead? Is that a common thing or just when annoying doctors ask you out on dates?" Rio returned, those dark eyes flashing with her intent to press, however gently.</p><p>"I used to drink whiskey... A lot. Inner demons and yadda yadda, but it got pretty gnarly there for a while. So to save my liver, I found other ways to occupy my time," Agatha explained, though as she stopped talking, their drinks were being pushed across the counter to them, a soft harmony of 'thank you's coming from both of them.</p><p>In the matter of a second, their attention had re-focused again on one another.</p><p>"So is that like... Your way of saying you smoke pot?"</p><p>Agatha had thought she'd been vague enough that Rio wouldn't immediately point it out, but as she was quickly coming to learn, Rio was listening just as hard to what Agatha was not choosing to say just as much as she was listening to the words she used.</p><p>"Occasionally," Agatha offered back nonchalantly as her eyes fell to their two drinks. "But I prefer edibles. I sleep better that way."</p><p>Rio reached forward and picked the lowball glass up off of the bar between two fingers before she swung it down to cradle the base of it in her palm. Agatha took her cue and picked up her own drink, turning to face Rio a little more on her stool, though by doing so she accidently brushed her leg against the front of Rio's suit leg. Immediately she swallowed down the tightness that started to form in her throat.</p><p>Agatha had been about to ask what they were going to toast to, but Rio held up her glass.</p><p>"To getting, and or almost getting, hit by cars!"</p><p>It was almost like a delayed reaction, the way it took a few seconds extra to process in Agatha's mind. When it did?</p><p>Agatha burst into laughter. It was a pure and raw sound, one that sounded foreign even to her own ears, but it was so <i>bright</i> and so <i>joyous</i> and so <i>amused.</i></p><p>Judging by the massive smile that had canvassed Rio's face and that sparkle of triumph in her eyes? It was exactly what she had been trying to do, and she had succeeded.</p><p>Agatha raised her glass, touching the rims together.</p><p>"To getting, and or almost getting, hit by cars!"</p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Through the first two drinks the two of them shared, Agatha had learned a few things.</p><p>Firstly, for being a doctor, Rio could not keep pet fish alive to save her life. She had detailed three separate occasions since childhood that she had done everything right (which was believable) and still, somehow the fish had died each time. It had left her with a stern belief that pets were not her thing.</p><p>Secondly, Rio had come to love Boston, and had even enjoyed growing up in Miami, but she really missed Columbus. She detailed why, too. It was living in the Short North -- the gay mecca of the city -- and always having donuts available at 4am. It was home to one of the remaining nineteen lesbian bars in the country that were stated as such. Her favorite place to go had been Skully's, which she explained was a music diner and they frequently had a variety of live music throughout any given week.</p><p>Thirdly, Rio liked to draw. There had been a part of Agatha's creative heart that had squeezed at this information. Rio insisted she wasn't great at it, but that when she sat down with too many nerves to handle, she would pick up a pencil and sketch. Something about this moved Agatha, but she couldn't pinpoint it outside of her own desire to create. It still left her feeling a touch warmer than the alcohol was already allowing.</p><p>In that exchange, she had given up the smallest pieces of herself.</p><p>She talked about the time she learned pipefitting in Budapest, spending three months living with the woman who had been teaching her. She left out the story of how they met, though. That wasn't suitable first date material.</p><p>She also told Rio about her time in Germany, about the old man that lived a few houses down the block. She told her about how she used to sit outside with him while he laid bricks and taught her bits and pieces of German. She then went on to include that after a month, he taught her how to brick lay and she had spent the seven months of her time there working for him. Agatha recounted that it was the one thing that had really helped her physical stature, asserting that the physical strength it gave her had been rejuvenating.</p><p>Rio had asked where else she had lived, but aside from a brief mention of Paris, she had still held onto some of that information, keeping it close to the vest. It wasn't that she didn't trust Rio, it was just that she still felt wary about how little they knew each other. Sure, Rio was terrifyingly easy to talk to, but Agatha couldn't find it in her to drop her guard entirely. It was slipping more and more, though, with each old fashioned she finished off.</p><p>By the time their third round of drinks had come -- which Agatha had not missed the fact that Rio was taking double shots of that really expensive bourbon-- their position on those stools had shifted to a point where they had each rotated about ninety degrees. Agatha's skirt had come up enough that it had made it quite easy to place her knee between Rio's, with one of Rio's knees settling between her thighs.</p><p>It hadn't been calculated, hadn't been planned, but the ease with which it happened almost startled her. It was like she had been inching closer and closer until finally, there was true and intentional physical contact. It had felt like this strange pull, almost magnetic in some ways. The more Agatha was learning about Rio, the closer she wanted to be.</p><p>Surely, they were only scratching the surface with their little back and forth, but as the drinks kept coming, Agatha's hunger for more only seemed to grow.</p><p>She picked up the newly refilled drink and took a long draw, watching Rio over the rim of her glass.</p><p>Beautiful Doctor Rio.</p><p>Although Agatha had thought she was doing a pretty decent of keeping her cool, every single time she looked at Rio in that damn suit, she felt a stirring deep in her middle. She wasn't just beautiful, she was <i>stunning.</i> The air with which she carried herself practically shouted that she was aware, but it wasn't in any kind of cocky way. It had this sense of self-confidence tied to it, like Rio knew that she was a good-looking, well-intentioned human being and no one could convince her otherwise.</p><p>It was well deserved, if Agatha could submit her two cents over it.</p><p>There was something else, though, especially as Rio leaned in a little closer, her elbow still on the bar as she took a measured pull from her glass. There was mischief in her eyes, the gap still closing between them. Then, she spoke.</p><p>"Of all the places you been... Where were the women craziest in bed?"</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened slightly, caught off guard by the bluntness of the question and even more by that calm look that was scrawled across Rio's face, as if she had not just dropped a hot coal of a question into Agatha's palms.</p><p>Agatha seemed to falter for only a moment before she straightened up a little, her knee between Rio's legs shifting slightly. In exactly two seconds, Rio squeezed her own legs together, trapping her there.</p><p>The ripping of heat up Agatha's neck was immediate and she was in an active struggle to not let that heat spill onto her cheeks. This woman was unbelievable and yet, with that warm bubble of heat in her stomach from the alcohol, she was having a difficult time being upset about it.</p><p>She seemed to take the question into consideration for a moment as she raised her glass for another healthy sip, though her eyes never left Rio's as she placed it back down on the bar top.</p><p>"Iceland. No question."</p><p>At this, Rio's grin was wide and instant. "Gotta keep warm somehow?" she posed, her grin tempering into a smirk that made Agatha's heart thud a little harder in her chest. It also caused her to chase down that heat burning within her with another valiant pull of that old fashioned.</p><p>"I guess it's just something about the constant state of never knowing when you get to leave the house that really does it for some of them," Agatha said back, her own lip curling up on one side, though it didn't quite reach the smirk she was succeeding in tempering.</p><p>She watched as Rio took another steady drink from her glass, one that Agatha knew had to burn on the way down.</p><p>"And what is it that really does it for <i>you,</i> Agatha?"</p><p>Agatha nearly choked on the mouthful of whiskey she'd been trying to swallow. Sure, Rio was probably a little deeper in the alcohol than she had been, but she tried to squash the distance by throwing the rest of her own drink back and giving a wave to the bartender for a refill, which appeared a couple of moments later. In one pull, that one was half gone, too.</p><p>Finally, she turned back to face Rio, her expression a little smoother than it had been since she had been posed with that kind of question.</p><p>"Confidence," she replied back simply, though her eyes cast down at her drink to keep Rio from looking into her eyes long enough to find a thread to pull on.</p><p>"Oh?" Rio posed back, an eyebrow arching in curiosity. "How so?"</p><p>"When a woman is assured in her ability to please and doesn't question herself, it's... it's nice."</p><p>At this, Rio barked a dry laugh, her chin tipping down toward her chest so that she could peer at Agatha beneath her lashes.</p><p>"It's <i>nice?"</i> Rio countered almost in mockery.</p><p>There came that heat again.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. "But what <i>really</i> does it for me is control."</p><p>Rio's chin picked back up and there was a shimmer of something in her eyes; intrigue. She did not speak, though, and instead stared Agatha down long enough to encourage her to continue.</p><p>"There's been quite a bit in my life that I have had no control over. But, when clothes are off and lights are low, it's invigorating to know that's <i>one thing</i> I know how to do with my own confidence, no questions asked. When what I say goes, it tends to play out better for any concerned party."</p><p>Agatha could hardly believe the words as they spilled from her lips, even if she meant every single one. Sure, she knew how to flirt and she knew how to seduce, but she was trying to remind herself that this was a <i>date.</i> What the fuck did that word even actually mean anymore? The last time Agatha had been on a date, it had been far before Nicky had been born. God, that was pretty fucking embarrassing.</p><p>Shouldn't there have been a little more decorum, or had the meaning of that word changed so drastically that she had not been able to keep up?</p><p>Whatever the answer to that question was, it didn't really matter. What mattered was that she and Rio were sat, legs locked, staring one another down to see who might buckle first. Agatha was realizing pretty quickly that she liked the feeling she got from rising to the challenge. It was hot, it was almost molten and it gave her a sense of power. She could move across the board with intent, pulling pieces off the closer she got to the Queen. The closer she got to Rio.</p><p>As she took in Rio's expression, it seemed as though <i>she</i> had not been expecting those words to come from Agatha, either.</p><p>Maybe the whiskey was working better than either of them had initially thought.</p><p>"Hm," Rio mused through a puff of air through her nose. Even though she'd been surprised, that expression had almost immediately shifted into something smoother, something that almost tried to seem like indifference.</p><p>The expression said one thing. The flames licking at the irises of Rio's eyes said something entirely different.</p><p>"Yes?" Agatha challenged, though she still had not moved an inch from where they sat, only about eight inches between their faces.</p><p>Rio shifted only to bring her glass to her lips, her eyes never wavering as she took a pull that left one more in the glass.</p><p>"That makes sense."</p><p>That was it?!</p><p>That was all she had to say?!</p><p>Immediately, a different kind of heat sparked in Agatha. As she opened her mouth to spew her rebuttal, though, she caught sight of the smirk Rio was wearing. It froze that heat, for just a moment. She didn't need to get angry. This was how Rio was choosing to spar. She was pushing, Agatha suddenly realized.</p><p>This had to be Agatha's idea. Just like it had been her idea to ask for Rio's number, however delirious she had been. Just like it had been her idea to ask Rio to join her for lunch.</p><p>The only thing here that had not been Agatha's idea was this date, and even in the midst of it, Rio was clearly indicating that the choice was Agatha's to be made.</p><p>She could have argued, she could have tried to defend herself, but she was starting to feel like there wasn't really a point to that. Rio wasn't attacking her, or her character. Rio had been asking questions just as much as Agatha had. The interest was there, but the more liquor they consumed, the more Rio stopped acting like this was solely an attempt at getting to know one another on a surface level.</p><p>For being on a playground that Agatha frequented when it came to hooking up with women, this was the first time she had ever seemed to question herself in this manner. It wasn't even that she was questioning herself, it was more that she was questioning if she'd bitten off more than she could chew with this woman.</p><p>She still had that bright disposition, but it had shifted to something that was meant to scorch and it had Agatha fumbling to throw her shades on to try to stand the heat.</p><p>Finally, after a tension filled silence that consisted of them staring each other down, Agatha found the words she'd been looking for.</p><p>"What is that gets <i>your</i> engine revving, Doctor Vidal?" Agatha fired back, both brows arching in interrogation.</p><p>That devilish smirk twisted up Rio's lips right before she threw the rest of her bourbon back was almost sinister. She set the glass down with a little more force than she had probably intended on and the smirk had returned, still so very dangerous.</p><p>Rio's voice dropped at the same time she leaned a little closer, from eight inches to no more than two, though she veered slightly to her right to make sure her message was delivered exactly where it needed to go, nestling into Agatha's ear.</p><p><i>"What really gets me going..."</i> she murmured huskily, her hand moving so that one finger placed itself right at the hem of Agatha's skirt just above her knee, tracing light lines there. <i>"Is how goddamn guarded you are, yet you're sitting here telling me you like to wield control like a weapon, as if that wouldn't entice me to invite you back to mine."</i></p><p>Agatha swallowed -- hard.</p><p>She hadn't exactly been trying to push back in any way, as she was quite enjoying the little back and forth that they were sharing in. Still, the fact that Rio called her all the way out on being so guarded? Rio had to have known that this had been something that had made her nervous, if for no other reason than the resistance she had initially offered. Then again, it seemed like Rio was quickly developing an ability to read Agatha like words on a page.</p><p>She had all of five seconds to make a decision. And she did, however tainted it was by the effects of the alcohol.</p><p>Her head turned slightly, just enough that she was able to press her lips to the corner of Rio's mouth, her hand reaching up for the far side of Rio's face at the same time. Agatha removed the contact and used her hold on Rio's cheek to turn her head enough so that Agatha could kiss her full-on.</p><p>It may have been a little sloppy despite her best efforts, but it was still like setting off fireworks in the dead of night. The way Agatha's heart was suddenly pounding in her throat, the way she felt like she could have absolutely folded into the other woman, the way she suddenly wanted nothing more than to be in some dark room in some corner instead of on full display in that bar.</p><p>The kiss did not elevate much past lips gripping and tugging just barely and only lasted for a grand total of ten seconds, but by the time Rio pulled away, those flames burning hotter in her eyes?</p><p>She was grinning. She was grinning so broad, so fully that it almost took Agatha's breath away.</p><p>The kiss was Agatha's idea. Just as Rio had intended it to be. Her goading had worked, and she knew it. Rio also was clearly aware that every question she had asked that Agatha had answered had been deliberate and calculated.</p><p>Agatha straightened a little bit, which unfortunately put more space between them, but it was a move of certainty, of assurance. Agatha was building herself back up to take this woman head on. Her blue eyes dropped to her drink as it sat almost-finished on the bar top. After a moment's hesitation, she picked it up and tossed back the remaining contents. Turning back to Rio, an ember flickered to life in that azure gaze as it took her in evenly.</p><p>"So?" Agatha posed, her voice firm but not loud.</p><p>Rio's eyes flickered slightly, darting across Agatha's face as she tried to read what was coming.</p><p>"So...?" Rio returned.</p><p>Agatha's face mirrored that wicked smirk as she leaned a little closer, her eyes flittering up to Rio's beneath her brow at the same time a firm grip landed on the fabric of Rio's suit pantleg atop her thigh.</p><p>
<i>"Are you enticed?"</i>
</p><p>For the first time the entire evening, Rio's posture stiffened slightly, but she didn't move much. Agatha almost could have sworn she heard the way her breath caught in her throat. She didn't go far, but those eyes were full of heat and desire if Agatha had ever seen it before.</p><p>Rio's lips pressed firm and hard and Agatha realized instantaneously that it was on purpose. She was waiting to see how bad Agatha would want it, to test her and see just how far she might push, but Agatha was done. She was snapping the pencil in half and throwing the test papers in the air.</p><p>Her hand slid higher, her thumb strategically placed on the highest part of Rio's inseam that she could reach.</p><p><i>"That isn't an answer,"</i> Agatha's sultry whisper came. As if to punctuate her words, she gave a firm grip on Rio's thigh.</p><p>The softest, almost imperceptible whimper fell from Rio's lips and even though her posture was still rigid, Agatha could see in her eyes that she was buckling.</p><p><i>"I'm fucking enticed,"</i> Rio nearly hissed as she leaned back, raising a hand to flag down the bartender. The haste with which she demanded the tab be closed and then signed the receipt was pretty amusing to Agatha.</p><p>She had the upper hand, now, for however long it would last.</p><p>She'd cracked through that facade of cavalier indifference that Rio had been wearing and now, this was where the fun began.</p><p>The moment Rio slipped her card back into that little wallet, she was on her feet and throwing her coat around her shoulders, seemingly in some kind of hurry, though she was a little unsteady on her feet.</p><p>Slowly, Agatha slid off of her stool and got to her feet, giving a little shimmy of her shoulders as the full weight of just how drunk she actually was smacked into her. She swayed slightly in place, but braced herself on the back of the stool while she gained her bearings. As her eyes lifted to Rio, she could see she was almost frantic with the need to get the hell out of there.</p><p>A tamer version of that smirk tugged on Agatha's lips. Oh, this would be fun.</p><p>Very, very slowly, she turned toward the stool she had been perched upon and lifted her coat, giving it a gentle shake in front of her. She could feel it, the laser precision with which Rio was staring her down. She could also see, out of the corner of her eye that Rio's Doc Marten was swiveling on the ball of her foot though she wasn't moving.</p><p>Rio was growing impatient.</p><p>And Agatha was loving every delectable second of it.</p><p>As she held up the coat in front of her, as if to survey it, she was more than surprised when she felt the material disappear as it was yanked out of her hands.</p><p>Wild eyes turned, finding Rio as she bustled about to practically throw the coat over Agatha's shoulders like a cape.</p><p>"Let's go!" Rio pressed in a sound that only slurred slightly, but enough for Agatha to understand that they were both pretty toasted.</p><p>What surprised Agatha was that even in this newfound drunken lust Rio had discovered, Rio still took hold of her hand. Sure, it was to drag her out of that bar, but the lightness that graced Agatha's chest the moment it happened was something she certainly had not been anticipating. She followed, though, letting Rio pull her through the remaining people, which had thinned exponentially since they had arrived.</p><p>Agatha did have enough sense on their way out the door to check the time, which popped up as just after midnight. She had stowed her phone back in her coat pocket, trying as Rio pulled her to at least get one arm in the damn coat. Given her state of intoxication, it was quite the sight.</p><p>Rio still had a damn death-grip on her hand as she pulled her down the sidewalk, leaving Agatha to try and catch up in her damn heels.</p><p>"Rio! Where the fuck are we going?!" Agatha managed, the breathlessness she was feeling nearly clinging to her words.</p><p>"Mine!" Rio barked back, but it wasn't an angry or irritated sound.</p><p>It was one that rang with the starvation her loneliness had bestowed upon her.</p><p>"Okay! But, where the fuck is that?!" Agatha managed, this time not able to keep from laughing. It was comedic, really, just how fast this had all flipped on its head.</p><p>This seemed to loosen Rio up a little bit, too. Her grip slackened and Agatha could see from her position slightly to Rio's right and behind as her cheeks pushed up into a smile. Even though Agatha couldn't see it, something about knowing it was there tickled the insides of her chest in a way that almost robbed her of her breath.</p><p>"Two blocks away!" Rio nearly shouted over her shoulder despite the fact that Agatha was only half a step behind her. As they reached a crosswalk, though, Rio stopped before Agatha realized what was going to happen, and for a second time that day, Agatha barreled right into her. This time, Rio was angled in a way that she was able to catch Agatha as they bumped into each other, immediately spilling laughter in a cacophony of delight into the early morning air.</p><p>The next several minutes were sheer chaos as the two of them, drunk beyond measure, stumbled and slipped their way toward Rio's condo, the laughter dancing in the air in their wake, a trail of audible crumbs that anyone could have followed to find them in their inebriated state.</p><p>As Rio made a swift turn into the dark street, Agatha was being dragged like a kite behind her. The patch of ice Rio's Docs slid onto caused her to slip, but Agatha was quick into action, pulling her back with enough force that Rio nearly slammed into her chest, though her arm flew up around to secure her so that even if they did go down, they were going down together.</p><p>Somehow, even in her heels, Agatha managed to keep them upright, though she had not realized just how hard she was gripping onto the woman in her arms. For just a moment, there was the locking of their eyes that made Agatha question everything she'd been doing in her life up to that point. With a blink, it was gone and she wanted to kiss Rio again.</p><p>As her head dipped, her drunken mind caught up to the fact that Rio's face was illuminated in a bright light and then, there was a loud and blaring sound. At first, judging by the looks on their faces, it didn't register immediately. The longer it went on, their heads snapped to the side to see a car rolling toward them.</p><p>In another bout of shrieks and giggles, they managed to clear the rest of the street, though as they hit the sidewalk, Rio bumped into Agatha again, still laughing.</p><p>"Did we really almost just get hit by a car together?!" she trilled, the astonishment sweet on her words.</p><p>"Your toast worked real fuckin' well, then?" Agatha managed back, her own giggles still bubbling in her chest.</p><p>"Well, of the two of us, you're still the only one that <i>actually</i> got hit by a car," Rio pointed out, though that damn drunken grin on her face was practically infectious.</p><p>Agatha's eyes lifted down the street, her gaze sweeping back toward Rio.</p><p>"Are we almost there yet?! It's cold as fuck and we're gonna die if it's any further," she pressed, though her own smile was still pushing at her cheeks.</p><p>"Nope," Rio managed, eliciting a groan from Agatha. She stepped back, though, flourishing a hand to the three story condo that they were stood in front of. Agatha's eyes swept up, taking in the sight of the place, though she couldn't make out distinguishing details like color or decor because of the time of night. There was no porch light on.</p><p>"You live <i>here?"</i> Agatha managed, a little gobsmacked.</p><p>"Don't make it weird," Rio returned, pulling on Agatha's hand as she tugged her up the steps and to the front door. Her hand delved inside of her pocket and produced her house keys, taking a couple of tries to get it unlocked for a couple of reasons. The first two times, she was trying to use the wrong key. The third time, she couldn't get the key to line up with the opening of the lock to which Agatha could not curb her tongue.</p><p>"Aw, little baby lesbian. Honey, it's supposed to go <i>in</i> the hole," she teased, though almost before she could finish, the giggles rattled out of her.</p><p>"Shut up, you," Rio shot back sharply, though it wasn't mean, necessarily.</p><p>"Eh, make me."</p><p>The same time Agatha spoke, Rio sank the key into the lock and turned it, nearly kicking the door open with the toe of her shoe, not realizing how much force she had applied.</p><p>Rio swung around, the soles of those Docs directly over the threshold of the door, and was face to face with Agatha, that wicked grin painting itself from ear to ear across Rio's face.</p><p>As she took a step back, she gave a rough tug on Agatha's hand to pull her into the house. Their chests collided again, but this time there was no need for separation. Rio's arm whipped out, hand catching the door and flipping it forward, nearly slamming it as it closed.</p><p>
<i>God, she was so fucking hot. </i>
</p><p>Agatha's hands had landed on the inside of Rio's coat, on the lapels of her suit and as their eyes met and the understanding that they were alone settled into them. The switch inside of her brain seemed to suddenly kick into the 'ON' position.</p><p>Instantly, palms slid up toward Rio's shoulders, pushing the coat off of them and in turn, forcing her to remove the hold she had around Agatha's waist so it could be shucked. Once it was, her hands fell back on those lapels, but this time she gripped them tight and brought Rio one-hundred-percent of the way to her own mouth, crushing their lips into a kiss that she had been holding in since that first brushing of their lips in the bar.</p><p>It was hard, it was hot, and it was absolutely and undeniably sloppy from just how drunk they were. Agatha didn't care though. That expensive bourbon tasted delicious on Rio's lips. Without waiting for permission, the moment Rio's lips even slightly parted, Agatha's tongue pressed forward, finding Rio's in her mouth. This action also caused a soft rumble of a moan to rattle out of Rio's throat and Agatha ate it up.</p><p>Even with as intoxicated as she was, Agatha still knew what she was doing. She had done this tens, if not hundreds of times throughout her life. She'd fucked women in twelve different countries, thirteen if you counted her home one. This was not new to her, was not something that she needed to think through.</p><p>This was as easy as breathing for Agatha.</p><p>The moment she felt Rio engage, though, it turned up the temperature in the air around them. Agatha's knuckles were practically white from how hard she was gripping at those lapels but she felt like she couldn't pull Rio any closer.</p><p>The more their tongues pressed and pushed, the more the moans began to spill out of each of them. Agatha had thought that bourbon tasted great on Rio's lips, but tasting it on every inch of the inside of her mouth that she could get to? Even better.</p><p>Rio's hands had, at first, struggled to find purchase. After a moment, though they landed on either side of Agatha's ass, pulling her closer even though there was absolutely nowhere else she could go. Agatha didn't care. She would have damn near melted into Rio right then if it would have been possible, just crawled into her skin and lived amongst her bones. <i>That</i> was how deep her desire for closeness to this woman was.</p><p>After a good several minutes of making out right in that damn foyer, Agatha had decided that she was entirely fed up with the fact that they were still clothed. She pried her lips off of Rio's, though she didn't miss the way Rio had tried to bite down on her tongue to keep her from doing so. Her jaw set and her head cocked as her eyes narrowed, as if scolding her for a moment.</p><p>It was over in a flash as Agatha's eyes dropped to her hands and she made quick work of the lone button that held the jacket together in the middle. Once it was open, there was nothing sensual about the way Agatha completely stripped it off of Rio's frame, not giving the slightest fuck as to where it landed as she tossed it aside.</p><p>As she went for the blouse buttons, Rio's hand shot up and secured itself in Agatha's hair, cradling the back of her head with force as she pulled her in for another breathless kiss. It was so goddamn hot and heavy that Agatha almost forgot about her task of trying to release the buttons without completely destroying the shirt. It looked good on Rio, she thought. Maybe she'd get to see her wear it again...</p><p>
<i>Buttons! Get the buttons undone!</i>
</p><p>Agatha found a way to divide her attention evenly, this time letting Rio's tongue trace and explore her mouth. It gave her a little more brain capacity to get those last few buttons undone. Once it was open, Agatha wasted no time in untucking it from those pants. She wanted it off, but to do that she had to pull their lips apart; she wanted to see the treasure she'd been unwittingly chasing.</p><p>She separated them again, though she didn't meet Rio's gaze so evenly this time. Instead, her eyes dropped and took in the absolute meal in front of her.</p><p>That little silver locket sat just below the divot at the base of her neck, washing into an ocean of skin that rose like the tide into two damn near <i>perfect</i> breasts that were housed in lace that was a color Agatha could not discern in the dark. She didn't care what color it was. She cared about what it was holding.</p><p>One of her arms snaked around Rio's waist as she pulled her those few inches closer, but ducked her own head. Instantly, Agatha's face met the cleavage there, lips kissing and sucking in an instant. Rio's hand that had been in her hair flexed and Agatha couldn't refrain from huffing a soft puff of satisfaction against Rio's skin.</p><p>The moment she started pulling on Agatha's hair, Agatha reacted without much thought, her teeth sinking into the skin of Rio's left breast causing her to yelp and then hiss in response, but she didn't pull Agatha back, so she instead ran the tip of her tongue on the slightly raised skin.</p><p><i>"Agatha,"</i> Rio moaned, her voice nearly cracking over the single word.</p><p>Agatha's lips began to move, to travel, trekking up the center of Rio's sternum to her throat. Diverting, she dipped to her left, letting that lingering trail of kisses glide up the side of Rio's neck. There was one spot, just below and just behind Rio's ear that when Agatha skimmed it?</p><p>Not only did Rio give an involuntary tug on Agatha's hair -- causing Agatha's own hold to tighten around her -- but everything in her body tensed for almost a solid ten seconds.</p><p>Ah, that was where to start digging.</p><p>Agatha's lips latched onto that specific spot and began to suck. Rio's nails were skimming her scalp, but it only drove her on, pushed her to keep going. She wasn't telling her to stop, was she? Then stopping would be falling to the bottom of Agatha's list of things to worry about for the time being.</p><p>The arm that had been around Rio's middle released, though Agatha's lips were still making work of Rio's skin.</p><p>Both of Agatha's hands came around to take hold of the open edges of Rio's blouse so that she could help push it over her shoulders and down her arms. Once it was off, Agatha's hands were on Rio's face again, their lips colliding in another electrifying kiss. Teeth clicked, sighs passed from lungs to lungs, something carrying with them the vibrations of moans and grunts.</p><p>Agatha wanted to be somewhere else, though, and she did not hesitate to make it happen as she placed her hands on Rio's sides, guiding her back to where she could see the stairs illuminated by the window on the landing. Through her task, their lips never separated, that kiss never broke.</p><p>Agatha's hold did, the moment Rio's hands began the task of getting her out of that blazer which fell to the floor, discarded and unimportant. In the same moment that it was removed, her hands fell back on Rio's bare sides. They slid up, fingertips brushing the band of lace that wrapped around her torso.</p><p>She had misjudged the distance, though, and the back of Rio's shoe caught the first stair and she started to fall back, but Agatha was quick to catch her, a strong arm wrapping around her to hold her close.</p><p><i>"Fucking shoes,"</i> Rio growled as their lips finally broke apart. Agatha could agree with that sentiment.</p><p>There was a moment where they just looked at each other and laughed.</p><p>And then, more laughter as they tried to get their shoes off and Agatha, in her sheer stubbornness, ended up on her ass after trying to balance on one heel to unbuckle the other. While she was down, she managed to get them both off and tossed them aside, quickly scrambling back to her feet. Rio had been tossing away her remaining sock as Agatha nearly ran right into her, picking right back up on the kiss they'd been drowning in before they had remembered their shoes.</p><p>This time, Rio knew where she was and was able to slowly guide them -- backwards -- up the stairs. They got up a few, but Agatha grew impatient. She pinned Rio's back to the wall, a couple of the framed pieces of artwork rattling around her. Agatha almost smirked into their kiss, but she was too occupied with the battle of their tongues to commit to it.</p><p>The longer they kissed, the more Agatha's hand started to wander. It had started on Rio's hip, but then slid up to palm her breast. She gave a firm squeeze and pulled a noise out of Rio that was as delicious as the smell of the perfume on her skin.</p><p>Agatha adjusted herself slightly, taking another step down which caused their lips to tear apart. However, with her being uneven on the stairs, it put her right where she wanted to be. Her fingers curled into the cup of the lace bra and tugged down, exposing the entirety of Rio's breast. Agatha did not hesitate to place her lips over the stiff nipple, sucking hungrily, but not enough to cause any harm.</p><p>As Rio began to squirm beneath the unrelenting attention from Agatha's lips and tongue, Agatha's left hand moved, landing on the outside of Rio's far thigh. It rubbed and gripped, sliding around the front as it ran up the top. Due to the way Agatha had situated them, it made it incredibly to place her hand, palm side up, directly between Rio's legs. She lifted up at the same time her teeth caught Rio's nipple between them. The moment she released it, Rio pulled Agatha back by the hair, damn near panting,</p><p><i>"Safe word?"</i> Agatha purred, pressing that palm into Rio's clothed core. The whimper that tumbled out of her left Agatha feeling quite ravenous.</p><p><i>"Pussy,"</i> Rio snapped back, her chest still rising and falling with her labored breathing.</p><p>Agatha's smirk was devious as was that white light in her eyes. That could have been both an insult and an answer, so Agatha simply took it as both.</p><p>
<i>"One more time? I didn't hear you?"</i>
</p><p>Rio's eyes narrowed, but she met the challenge.</p><p><i>"Puss-- oh!"</i> Rio gasped as her head tilted back and eyes closed, that pressure lifting again in a sudden push out of Agatha's palm. Rio grit her teeth, eyes flying open again as she reached down for Agatha's blouse, tugging on it to demand she meet her evenly.</p><p>They began stumbling again, kissing and moving, bumbling and falling between breathless laughs and pleasured moans. They'd made it to the landing, but it had only been a couple more stairs before Agatha was pinning Rio to the wall again, kissing and sucking and biting at every available inch of flesh.</p><p>As they broke apart again and Agatha lifted her gaze? They still had four steps on the <i>first fucking flight.</i></p><p><i>"Why are there so many fucking stairs in your house?"</i> Agatha muttered sharply.</p><p><i>"I am actually... wondering the... same thing right now,"</i> Rio managed through the gasping breaths she was trying to draw in.</p><p><i>"Fuck this,"</i> Agatha hissed, turning back to face Rio, though her hands fell between them and she was undoing Rio's belt, literally tossing it over her shoulders down the other stairs, soft metallic clanks sounding as it dropped to another stair below the one it had landed on. One it was gone, those slacks were unfastened and unzipped and sliding down Rio's hips.</p><p>Hungrily, Agatha took just a moment to drink her in, to really appreciate what was there. She was literally a goddamn knockout. Her body? Probably in the top three of bodies she'd ever wanted to ogle.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha thought about just demanding what she wanted, but she realized that she was a little behind in the strip game. Rio seemed to catch onto this, too, and grabbed two fistfuls of fabric at Agatha's hips and gave one swift tug that caused the skirt to pool at her ankles. In seconds, Rio's slender fingers tucked into the pantyhose and swept those down, too. Agatha was quick to step out of them and kick them aside. Before Rio could make a play for the blouse, though, Agatha swept it over her head and tossed it aside.</p><p>There they stood, almost mirrors of one another in their undergarments. Both lace. Both proving their colors now in the light of the moon that poured in through the window. Rio's was a soft fern color, earthy and green. It matched the panties that hung on her hips. In much the same vein, Agatha was armored in lace as well, but hers was a light blue lilac. They were still close enough that Agatha could feel the heat pouring off of Rio, but just looking at the two of them in that state had fucked with her for just a split second before she brushed it off as being drunk.</p><p>Another slamming together of lips, another cascade of clicking teeth. Once Agatha was satisfied by just how much noise Rio was making without even being touched, she pulled away to flex the one thing she was good at: control.</p><p>She separated their bodies entirely, hands removing from Rio's soft skin as their eyes met across the space. A very unhappy whine sounded low in Rio's throat, but Agatha didn't budge.</p><p>In fact, she crossed her arms over her chest, eyes devouring the image of Rio -- cocky, confident, self-assured Rio -- standing there looking like she was absolute putty, ready to be sculpted.</p><p>Agatha's head tipped toward the remaining stairs.</p><p>Rio's gaze flickered there and back, a wrinkle forming on her brow.</p><p>
<i>"I'm over these stairs. I want you over them, too."</i>
</p><p>At this, Rio's eyes widened, but the rest of her face smoothed out as a smirk twisted its way onto her face. She stepped forward and reached up, curling her fingers into one side of Agatha's jaw, thumb mimicking the action on the other side, holding her firmly. Rio leaned in, almost like she was going to kiss her.</p><p>To Agatha's surprise, she felt very acutely the one spot that Rio's tongue curled along the underside of her upper lip. The low groan it drew from her was unreal.</p><p>
<i>Damnit! </i>
</p><p>Every time she thought she had the upper hand, Rio had to go and remind her that this was an even playing field.</p><p>Still, she watched and licked at her lips as Rio turned and did as she was told, kneeling on the lower steps enough so that she could lean forward to place her palms on the top step that actually opened up into the second story.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha stood on that landing and looked up at this woman on her hands and knees on a set of stairs, clad in lace that Agatha was damn near ready to tear off of her. She was like that purposely because she was willing to submit to Agatha's need for control.</p><p>Agatha stepped forward, her hands falling to Rio's hips as her fingertips looped into the waist of her underwear, pulling them over that scrumptious curve of her tanned ass cheeks. She could not resist the opportunity to sink her teeth into the right side, causing a yelp to sound around them as it rocketed from Rio's throat.</p><p>Agatha's smirk was constant as she stood back and gave the softest smack to the exact spot her teeth had left small red marks. Another yelp, but this one was followed by a low moan.</p><p>
<i>Jesus Christ, where the fuck had this been her whole life?</i>
</p><p>Agatha herself knelt down on the third step off the landing, leaving her face directly level with Rio's hot and wet core. Wasting no more time, both of Agatha's hands lifted and landed where ass shifted to thigh, her thumbs curling inward to sink between the softness of Rio's lips and pulled outward.</p><p>Nearly no time passed before Agatha pressed forward, mouth making contact with Rio's wet warmth. The way Rio's body trembled at the touch somehow only made Agatha want it even more, even though she had it right in front of her, right on the tip of her tongue.</p><p>A tongue that she knew how to work with great precision. It was a matter of finding the right pace, the right pressure. This was a new body, a new taste, a new anatomy and Agatha was learning it more and more as the minutes ticked on.</p><p>Every time the tip of Agatha's tongue would make any kind of gracing over Rio's clit, her entire body would clench, but Agatha could tell that she wasn't quite to that point, though the tensing got a little wilder each time. As she sensed that all it would take was a couple of swipes to reach the finish line, she pulled back and Rio let out the most astounded gasp.</p><p><i>"Agatha!"</i> she nearly shouted.</p><p>Agatha moved without a word, though, stepping up so that she could lean over Rio as she was positioned on those stairs. Her hair spilled over her shoulders as her lips graced Rio's ear, her words nothing but a soft warning. <i>"Shhh, darling,"</i> she cooed, and even that sound made Rio moan again.</p><p>Agatha's right hand slid from her neck to the middle of her back, fingers curling the band of her bra in their grip. Agatha straightened back up, but she kept that hold. Her left hand moved to drag nails up the back of Rio's thigh, but moved inward pretty quickly. With vital attention paid, Agatha's fingers dove into the wetness, feeling out similar paths that her tongue had found earlier, but then, she pressed two of them into Rio's core at the exact same time she gave a gentle pull on the bra band, tugging Rio's body back to meet the penetration.</p><p><i>"OH MY GOD!"</i> Rio cried, fingernails digging into the edge of the rug that lined the top of the steps.</p><p><i>"Mmmm,"</i> Agatha hummed, the satisfaction of watching Rio rock like that against the feeling of her hand written so clearly in her eyes. <i>"And <b>that's</b> how you get it in,"</i> Agatha growled, but this drew a response from Rio between gasps and moans.</p><p><i>"Fuck you, Agatha,"</i> Rio managed back, her tone tight and strangled because of the pleasure that was building in her middle with each thrust.</p><p><i>"Not yet,"</i> Agatha returned. She flipped her hand over so that it was palm side down and curled her fingers, picking up the pace. Even though she was still holding onto Rio's bra, every rocking move she made was her own. Agatha wasn't applying any force to it, and hadn't been for at least the last several moments.</p><p>The change of how she was holding her arm allowed her to lean over again, her hair brushing over Rio's back, causing her to tremble again, but not quite there.</p><p><i>"I think you want to come for me first,"</i> Agatha purred in her ear right before she caught the edge of it with her teeth and gave a gentle tug. That, it seemed, was what she had needed to do the trick.</p><p>Rio's head whipped back, actually catching the heft of Agatha's cheekbone in a collision that made Agatha's eyes water for just a moment. It dropped, though, and hung almost between her shoulders.</p><p>Fuck. That hurt. And would probably bruise.</p><p>Right then?</p><p>She was still drunk enough to not have a care in the world about it.</p><p>Plus, with the way Rio's core was tightening around her fingers and her body was fighting to remain on all fours? Who the fuck cared if she woke up with a black eye?</p><p>Agatha hadn't straightened, though, and instead placed kisses down Rio's spine as she felt the strength of the waves of her orgasm begin to ebb and ease.</p><p><i>"See, that wasn't so hard, now was it?"</i> Agatha drawled, lips still brushing over the skin of Rio's back.</p><p>Rio's head slowly lifted, her eyes falling onto the white sofa that sat in the lounge area. Agatha seemed to realize she was looking at something and followed her eyeline. Before she could raise question, she was cut off.</p><p><i>"Sofa,"</i> Rio panted. <i>"Now."</i></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>There were echoes of Agatha's untamed heartbeat at several different points throughout her body in response to Rio's soft and desperate demand. She could feel it in her wrists, in her ankles. The only part where it thudded harder than her neck was in her chest, convincing her that there was a slight risk of it breaking a couple of ribs.</p><p>It had stunned her, honestly. Despite that Rio was letting her have her fun, it had still caught her off guard that she'd sounded so demanding even in spite of the fact that she'd been so breathless.</p><p>Once again, Rio was reminding Agatha that in this back and forth, they were still on even ground. Rio had listened hard enough to the things Agatha had been telling her to know, even hammered, how to navigate this. It didn't matter what physical position they were in, who was above who because in the grand scheme of it?</p><p>Rio seemed to see to it that they remained eye-to-eye in their understanding of what was happening. She was proving it by showing it. Every time Agatha thought she got a better view from higher up, Rio grabbed those last few rocks to bring them neck and neck, scaling the absolute jagged cliffside of whatever the fuck this was turning into. All it was going to take was one wrong move on either of their parts to slip and careen straight for the ground.</p><p>Agatha wasn't sure she was ready to experience the plummeting feeling of the drop just yet. Instead, she was going to tighten the grip she had on the situation and find a way to hold on just a little longer.</p><p>Of course, the way the alcohol had fuzzed and blurred her rational line of thinking did not lend to great decision making. Right then, there with Rio as Agatha reached down to help set the other woman back on her feet, she couldn't have cared any less about making good choices.</p><p>She felt damn near feral over what had just unfolded between them. While Agatha would have absolutely jumped at the chance to do it again, she had sensed that the control she'd been given went both ways. She couldn't blame Rio, but Agatha was also the slightest bit on edge at the idea of relinquishing any type of grasp she had on things.</p><p>If she had been sober? It was likely that this would have been unfolding in a very different way. For some strange reason, Agatha's drunken brain... trusted Rio.</p><p>It made absolutely no sense; that afternoon, she'd been so fucking annoyed at Rio's little quips and digs, the way she was prying information out of Agatha like she had a crowbar in her hands. She hadn't given up, though, and the fact that Agatha could recognize that this was a chase meant that she needed to decide just how fast she was going to keep running.</p><p>When she and Rio had went their separate ways after their bookstore outing, Agatha had picked herself apart on whether or not this was a good decision. Perhaps, in the morning, she was going to wake up in a similar mind frame, but right then none of it mattered.</p><p>What mattered was the way, as Rio steadied herself and Agatha climbed the last few steps to the second floor, Rio's hand reached behind her, fingers tucking into the waist of Agatha's lace panties, giving it a tug as if to guide her forward. Stumbling only slightly, Agatha followed her lead up until the point that Rio's guidance left Agatha standing in front of that sofa.</p><p>Rio's hold released and she removed her finger, her eyes dropping to where it had been so that they could raise up the length of Agatha's torso. A tentative finger raised and traced down the center of Agatha's sternum, all the way until it hooked in the centermost part of that purple lace bra.</p><p>Agatha stood, stuck and breathless as she watched with interest the way Rio was so honed in to her own work that little else mattered. Slowly, those dark honey eyes lifted and even in the dark, they were still so goddamned beautiful.</p><p>The way Rio stared at her at her evenly made something like nervousness grip Agatha's stomach. What was she looking for? What did she see? Could she see that this was literally the only place in the world where Agatha felt comfortable?</p><p>Rio had mentioned that there was nothing wrong in doing things that were uncomfortable. Perhaps there had been some truth to that, but Agatha was quickly learning that the unpleasant feeling of the in-between could be crippling if she didn't wrangle it in.</p><p>The finger Rio had tucked into the lace gave a gently commanding tug, causing Agatha to step a half step forward as the warm skin of their stomachs met in a hot flush. At the exact moment of contact, the hand of Rio's that had been on Agatha's chest lifted and cradled her jaw with a firm grip. The other one concurrently landed, palm flat and fingers splayed, over the curve of Agatha's left ass cheek.</p><p>The inebriated squeal that left Agatha's lips only made it halfway out before Rio's mouth was back on hers, hot and wanting. As they kissed and sighed and shifted against one another, Agatha could almost feel the voraciousness as it began to boil and build inside of Rio's form. The more the time ticked on, the hungrier Rio seemed to get. Her tongue was exploring every bit of Agatha's mouth it could get to, most notably the way the tip of it curled along the roof of Agatha's mouth.</p><p>That had pulled a moan even Agatha had not known herself capable of. It was loud but deep, low in its register but pricked with the heat of what it did to her.</p><p>Some part of Agatha knew that Rio would ask. Rio would look her in the eyes and beguile Agatha to explain how she wanted this to play out. Even if they'd had too much to drink, she somehow had faith that it would still happen.</p><p>A much larger part didn't want to wait for that thought to come to fruition.</p><p>Deftly, a hand shot up to close its fingers around Rio's wrist there as it was gripping Agatha's jaw. It seemed to startle her for only a moment, but then that burning lust flickered back into her eyes, so close in range to Agatha's face. She was recognizing that this was another grab -- quite literally -- for control.</p><p>Agatha used that hold to slowly drag Rio's hand down over the purple lace, over the center valley of her abdomen, which was rather toned. She felt as her guide allowed Rio's fingers to skim over her navel, reaching the waist of those underwear. Her hand moved to press Rio's palm to her lower abdomen, laying flat atop it as she pushed further, delving beneath that gentle hug of lace.</p><p>The moment she felt Rio's fingers on her supple flesh, though, a worked up sigh released from tight lungs and Agatha's head tilted back slightly at the thrill of it. The moment she opened that space up, though, Rio was quick to feast. Her head tucked into the crook of Agatha's neck, lips hungrily kissing and sucking on what skin she could get to.</p><p>Between that and the feeling Agatha got as Rio's fingers began to move, completely taunting in their voyage, Agatha thought she just might explode.</p><p>Although she hadn't voiced it, or stated it so explicitly, this was a rare occurrence for Agatha. Part of needing power meant that giving it up in any way was a dangerous game when it came to her wellbeing. There had been a couple, though no more than three, instances where Agatha had let someone else call the shots. One of them had been Ilona, the woman she'd lived with in Hungary, but it had come months into their relationship.</p><p>Yet, there Agatha stood, her fingers curled into Rio's skin as they battled once more on who was going to be the more aggressive kisser. She could feel every single piece of herself that Rio was touching, all at once. Her movement wasn't even pushed on by intent, she was just... studying, learning.</p><p>After she was satisfied by what she had mapped out, Rio began a rhythm, steady and not in any way frantic despite the fact that Agatha could tell by the way she was kissing her that it was how she felt.</p><p>Each right move garnered a whimper, a moan, a sharp draw of the air that was leaving Agatha's lungs, pulling it into Rio's own.</p><p>The tighter her grip became around Rio's neck, the quicker she would move. Agatha could feel it, could sense the way her knees were beginning to grow weak, the way she felt even more unsteady on her feet than she already had because of their evening's earlier activities.</p><p>She started to pull away from their kiss, but this time Rio's teeth did catch hold of her tongue, keeping her stilled as another deep groan cracked like thunder out of Agatha's lungs. That coupled with Rio's pressure, applying it directly to Agatha's clit, dragged her right to that edge, and she was ready to leap.</p><p>And then, it was gone. Rio's hand slipped out of Agatha's underwear in the blink of an eye and the choked sound it provoked was almost pathetic. At the exact same time, their mouths separated and Agatha was still aware of every single place where the points of Rio's teeth had been digging into her tongue.</p><p><i>"Rio, what the fuck?!"</i> Agatha nearly screeched in a whisper, her brow pinched and her eyes narrowing.</p><p>Rio just stood there. At first, she was watching Agatha's face, her eyes. But then, that gaze wandered and Agatha could feel everywhere it touched. She could feel as it drifted down her neck, across her shoulders and chest. It lingered for a moment on her still-covered breasts, though her lips twisted in mild dissatisfaction. Those eyes moved again, scoping out every peak and valley of those abs -- Agatha really hadn't been kidding when she'd talked about how the bricklaying had impacted how she took care of her body --  down to those damn panties.</p><p>Agatha wasn't sure Rio was even aware she'd done it, but in a truly starved fashion, her tongue poked out to swipe from side to side across her bottom lip. She did not move, though. Instead, those eyes lifted back up and landed directly into Agatha's.</p><p><i>"I swear to the gods,"</i> Agatha hissed, beginning to grow the slightest bit anxious, though she did not have an ability to immediately understand why.</p><p>Rio's hand raised again, this time with one pointer finger curling around Agatha's chin.</p><p><i>"Tell me what you want me to do,"</i> Rio purred in soft request.</p><p>This, to Agatha, was an absolute lightning strike that splintered throughout her entire body.</p><p>She'd always brandished that power, that control, like it was her goddamn lifeline, and Rio had absolutely been paying attention in this exchange. Agatha was the one who called the shots, usually without any kind of request for permission. Consent was always mandatory, but the rigidity of permission turned flexible once in her hands.</p><p>Rio was willingly giving it to her, though, and it stunned her for just the briefest moment that it was something she hadn't had to take for herself.</p><p>Agatha blinked a couple of times before her cognition returned. She swallowed down that giant pit of need in her throat as she devised a plan. She glanced over her shoulder, down at the couch as an idea formed in her head. Her gaze cut back to Rio, dropping down to her chest and that damn green lace. Agatha was tired of it being there.</p><p><i>"First,"</i> she murmured, reaching forward to sink her fingertips into the warm skin of Rio's sides. She pulled her closer, directly into her so that their bodies were nearly crushed together as Agatha's hand snaked up Rio's spine, taking no time at all to work free the clasp. Hurried motions swiped the straps and pulled them down, leaving one hooked in her fingers as she entirely removed the garment and tossed it away. Not a beat later, Rio's nails were dragging up her skin to do the same, her own bra landing somewhere near Rio's on the floor.</p><p><i>"Mmm, better,"</i> Agatha murmured, her hands sliding up Rio's sides to cup each of her breasts in a palm, thumbs brushing over stiff nipples. Gods, she was so impossibly hot.</p><p><i>"Agatha,"</i>  Rio managed, though judging by the look on her face, managing the word as Agatha was caressing her like that was quite the feat. In response, Agatha's motions stilled, though she did not pull her hands away. Her eyes met Rio's, silently encouraging her to continue. Rio licked her lips again, but finally found her voice, a little harder than it had been the first time she'd stated as much.</p><p>
<i>"Tell. Me. What. To. Do."</i>
</p><p>With another crack of stiffened posture, lightning surged through Agatha again.</p><p>
<i>Gods be damned, she really meant that shit.</i>
</p><p>Another pit was shoved back down Agatha's throat with a measured swallow, but she could almost feel it as it dropped, heavy like lead, into her stomach.</p><p>She took a steadying breath, though it was by no means a sobering one. Instead, she'd only seem to get more drunk, but it had switched from alcohol to the intoxicating effects of what it was like to engage with Rio like this.</p><p>Slowly, Agatha took two steps to the side, though she never stopped watching Rio, who was curiously eyeing her, waiting on some form of directive. Agatha's eyes finally tore away and glanced to the floor in front of the couch before slicing back up again.</p><p><i>"Sit."</i> The demand was low, but it wasn't sharp. It was merely an instruction.</p><p>Despite how thick and charged the air around them was, Rio's response actually caught Agatha off guard. She followed the gaze, took in the command, and as she finally worked out in her own mind what was about to happen?</p><p>Rio's grin was wide and instant, bright enough to light up the dark house, and it caused Agatha's heart to not only flutter in her chest, but then to hammer away a moment later.</p><p>She said nothing else as she lowered herself to the ground and placed her back against the front portion of the couch. Her hungry gaze lifted to take in Agatha, who had just remembered that she still had a pair of absolutely soaked panties on and was actively in the middle of removing them.</p><p>Once they were discarded, Agatha moved so that she stood, one foot on either side of Rio's calves, her devious blue gaze dropping to the woman on the ground.</p><p>What met her?</p><p>It wasn't just a smirk. It was a curling of Rio's lips that happened in a way that turned Agatha's middle to pure lava. They'd been playing chess, but Agatha realized that Rio's intention had been to knock every single piece off of the board, leaving the two of them, the two queens, to move around each other in an attempt to force surrender.</p><p>Rio's faux surrender had worked, and Agatha was giving up more and more of herself than she had ever intended.</p><p>This wasn't quite enough to get her to fully crumble, though. This was a chance for her to assert that control once more, and for Rio to take it for what it was.</p><p>Before she took a single step forward, Agatha bent at the waist and hooked her grip along the bottom of Rio's jaw, lifting her head to tilt back, though it wasn't a forceful motion. Once it had reached where Agatha wanted it, she pressed their lips together in a full and passionate kiss, brushing and locking for just the briefest moment. She pulled back and straightened up, but her intent was clear.</p><p>With determination, Agatha stepped toward the couch until she let her knees sink into the cushions in a way that left her calves directly next to where Rio's head was tilted back into the cushion.</p><p>Agatha was still lifted as she scooched and adjusted so that she could find the correct positioning of her shins against the couch. She had been a little wary of her mental math when it came to how this might work, but it seemed to be panning out.</p><p>As she had considered lowering her body, there had been little time to actually ponder it. Instead, Rio's hands launched up and fastened -- hard -- around the haunches of each of Agatha's hips, fingertips digging nearly through flesh to reach bone. The act had truly shocked the sense out of Agatha who needed to steal an extra breath to remind herself that breathing was not, in fact, an option.</p><p>Rio pulled, though, tugging her down. She was very obviously tired of waiting for what she wanted.</p><p>The moment Agatha felt as Rio's tongue pressed to the inside of her thigh, dragging up to her dripping core, she let out a primal whine, like she were some beast in heat. She didn't understand it, could not fathom how the hell this woman was working her over like this without even actually <i>doing anything.</i> Of course it was the anticipation, especially as Rio's head turned and she began to trace the other side of Agatha's inner thigh with that damn tongue.</p><p><i>"Rio!"</i> Agatha cried, her hips lowering in a silent plea. In return, Rio's fingers dug deeper into her hips, trying to resist the weight Agatha was trying to impose for just a moment longer. One of Agatha's hands fell to Rio's wrist and gripped tightly, trying to apply pressure but Rio was a bit stronger than Agatha had given her credit for.</p><p>
<i>"I swear to the gods, if you don't eat me out this fucking sec -- fuck!"</i>
</p><p>In the midst of her threat, Rio had secured exactly what she wanted out of that exchange. She had Agatha <i>begging.</i> With her own satisfaction having been met in the moment, Rio pulled down on Agatha's hips the same moment her tongue slid perfectly between the folds of her lips.</p><p>The feeling of Rio's mouth on her body made every last bit of oxygen expel from Agatha's lungs in a moan that was bordering on the edge of morphing into a scream. All of the build up, every second of the game, it had wound her up far tighter than she ever had been before and it was showing.</p><p>She could feel with exact acuity every single spot that Rio's tongue traversed, down near her entrance to only swipe up so very fucking slowly until she barely graced the bundle of nerves at the apex of her inner lips.</p><p>Both of Agatha's hands had landed on the backing of the couch, knuckles already showing their whiteness at the strength of her grip. She fought the urge to move, to try and get closer.</p><p>No, Rio knew what she was doing. Yes, Agatha was still on the throne of her power -- quite literally -- but this was what it felt like when sacrificing some modicum of the armor she'd so tightly wrapped herself in.</p><p>Rio grew a little more hurried in her movements, though she was still deliberate with each pass she took. Agatha could feel as her tongue flattened against her core and drew upwards, the shape of her tongue shifting as she did so that by the time she reached Agatha's clit, it was nothing but the lightest flick of the tip of it.</p><p>By the fifth time she did that, Agatha was growing desperate. Her thighs shifted down, laying flat against the backs of her calves. Rio's mouth was fully on her, her nose first landing into wetness but then shifting slightly to press almost even with Agatha's pubic bone. She licked and sucked and lapped and groaned against Agatha in a way that was causing a sudden frenzy to take root at the base of her skull.</p><p>The grinding of her hips against Rio's mouth wasn't cutting it and as a result, grew a little more desperate.</p><p>Rio noticed this.</p><p>Of course she did.</p><p>In response, she released one of Agatha's hips from her grasp and slid it around the flesh of her ass until she could place it where she wanted it, nearly pinned to her own body so that she could achieve the angle she was searching for. When she had it?</p><p>If Rio had thought Agatha had been nearly screaming before? What came out of her the moment Rio sank three fingers into her was a bellowing wail of sheer pleasure that damn near made Rio come again just sitting there.</p><p>As the initial shock of the feel of Rio inside of her had worn off, Agatha felt like she couldn't get enough. She almost didn't want to reach that climax because she way she felt right then had been paramount to any other emotion she had experienced in literally years.</p><p>Agatha could fuck, sure. Rarely did she let herself be fucked. Letting Rio fuck her like this?</p><p>In the morning, she'd surely find herself in the throes of an identity crisis.</p><p>Right then, she wanted it to last forever.</p><p>There was eventually a moment when it had to end, and it was brought on by the way Rio had pressed into her as deeply as she could manage and hooked her fingers, pulling back down in a way that completely ravaged a rough and intense orgasm right out of Agatha.</p><p>Agatha, who flew forward, face pressing into the top of the couch cushions on the back as she let out a scream into them, stifled by the fabric and cotton that filled her mouth and nose.</p><p>It only drew on longer as she realized that Rio was not stopping that pumping motion in and out of her body, her lips pursed around Agatha's clit in a way that was literally causing her to tremble beyond her own control.</p><p><i>"R-Rio, f-fuck, RIO!"</i> she managed as she pulled her face away from the cushion enough to be heard.</p><p>Finally, Rio's remaining grip on one hip released and slowly, she let her fingers side out of Agatha's body, wet and hot from the pure sex of it all.</p><p>Agatha, still recuperating, had only managed to tune back into the reality of the moment at the same time she heard a soft sucking, followed by a <i>pop!</i> as Rio's fingers pulled from her own mouth. In an instant, Agatha felt like she was on fucking fire again. She battled the urge to just suck it up and drop her hips again, but she needed a minute to regain her bearings.</p><p>Slowly, she hoisted herself up and swung a leg over Rio's head so that she could pour herself into the corner of the sofa, completely spent for the moment. Her nude body nearly melted into those cushions, but before she could think much else, Rio was on her feet and climbing over top her, laying the weight of her own bare flesh against Agatha. Her head landed right on Agatha's collarbone -- which couldn't have been comfortable -- but Agatha let it happen.</p><p>The scariest part about it?</p><p>Agatha wasn't a cuddler. She didn't let people get that close to her, but the moment Rio seemed to fold into her, her arm hooked over the small of Rio's back and held her close. Her hair was close enough that Agatha could smell her shampoo mixed with the light scent of sweat. Even combined, it was an incredible aroma, something she wanted to hold onto for weeks to come.</p><p>Woah.</p><p>Weeks?</p><p>Agatha's eyes flew open in the dark at her own internal monologue. What the fuck? They'd spent all of one day together and Agatha was holding out hope that this might continue for a few weeks?</p><p>Who the fuck had she become since meeting this woman?</p><p>She was stuck in her own inner war, battling herself over what was happening to who she had always fundamentally been as a person when Rio's soft, gravelly voice sounded.</p><p><i>"The bedroom is upstairs,"</i> she murmured against Agatha's skin, placing a soft kiss there that almost felt too affectionate for what had just unfolded over the last hour or so, possibly longer. <i>"But I genuinely do not know if I can make it."</i></p><p>Agatha's lips curled in a worn-out smirk, giving Rio a little squeeze.</p><p><i>"I can carry you,"</i> Agatha returned and while it was soft, there was certainty in her voice. It might be on shaky legs, but she still did not doubt her ability to be the transport needed to shuttle Rio to her bed.</p><p>Rio breathed a light chuckle, as if in disbelief, but Agatha wasn't kidding.</p><p><i>"I'm serious. If you really want to make it there but genuinely don't know if you can, I promise you I can get us both there,"</i> she murmured, her head lulling just enough that her lips brushed the top of Rio's head unintentionally.</p><p>Rio simply whined in response, her face burrowing further into the skin of Agatha's chest.</p><p>They laid like that for a long few minutes, but despite how exhausted Agatha felt, she knew that she was not going to be able to actually relax with the way they were situated. The hand that had been stationed on Rio's back lifted, gently running her fingers through Rio's hair which seemed to elicit a soft hum of appreciation from deep in her lungs.</p><p>Another couple of minutes ticked by, but Agatha could feel where her back was starting to cramp with how she was propped against the arm of the couch.</p><p><i>"Hey,"</i> she whispered against Rio's hairline. <i>"C'mon."</i> She gave a soft tap to one side of Rio's ass as if trying to motivate her to move, but Rio produced a noise that sounded half groan half whine. <i>"Seriously, Rio, my back's cramping. Just sit up at least."</i></p><p>After another moment of insistent stubbornness, Rio began to shift, but the way she sat up, she was straddling Agatha's thighs. Using this to her advantage, Agatha took firm hold of her hips and managed to swivel herself enough to put her feet on the ground, Rio's legs still on either side of her.</p><p><i>"Don't let go and do not move. If you make me drop you on the stairs, it's entirely your fault,"</i> Agatha instructed as she looked up at the woman sat on her thighs. Rio gave a nod and leaned forward, draping her arms over Agatha's shoulders to hold onto her neck.</p><p>Once Agatha felt like Rio was secure enough around her, she placed one arm under Rio's ass and the other along the length of her spine, palm flat to her back as she scooted forward and managed to lift herself to her feet.</p><p>Rio's grip tightened around Agatha, holding herself closer in a way that caused the tiniest rip to happen in Agatha's chest. It wasn't a needy gesture, and Agatha knew it was only to keep herself secured around Agatha's waist, but being this close to someone in this manner was something that was pretty foreign for her.</p><p>Though she wasn't rushing, Agatha managed to get them up to the landing, then to the third floor before she realized that was the extent of her knowledge of where to go.</p><p><i>"Right. Second door on the left."</i> Rio's soft voice sounded into Agatha's neck, pretty close to her ear.</p><p>Agatha ignored the sheet of goosebumps that laid over her skin and did as she was told, following the path that had been set out for her. Once down the hall, she turned into the open doorway of what was Rio's bedroom. The moment her knees hit the edge of the bed at the bottom, she moved the arm that wasn't holding onto Rio's back to brace herself on the bed. Carefully, she lowered Rio down atop the duvet.</p><p>When she pulled away, she hadn't been expecting Rio to reach for her face with one hand, securing enough of a hold that she could bring Agatha back down to her, their lips brushing softly, something too tender to be a product of what had just happened. As their lips broke, those dark honey eyes were looking up at her, the question in them clear.</p><p>Rio didn't voice it. Instead, a gentle demand escaped from her parted lips.</p><p>
<i>"Stay."</i>
</p><p>Agatha's throat constricted in a way she'd not ever experienced before, a way that made her almost choke.</p><p>Agatha didn't stay the night.</p><p>But then again, Agatha had never been much of a cuddler before, either. What was more was that Agatha was already a little panicked at her own inclination to make sure it didn't happen again.</p><p><i>"Rio..."</i> she attempted, but even those small two syllables conveyed her absolute lack of conviction.</p><p><i>"Would you just lay down and stop trying to argue?"</i> Rio posed, leaning her head up just enough to catch Agatha's lips in an undemanding kiss.</p><p>With a soft sigh passing through her nose, Agatha conceded and rolled over to her back at Rio's side. What startled her, though, was how quickly -- and how easily -- Rio moved to fit herself against the side of Agatha's body, an arm hooking over her middle so she could pull herself closer. The way she had landed left her face pressed into Agatha's neck, surely an uncomfortable position, but Agatha didn't push it.</p><p>Instead, she closed her eyes and listened to the sound Rio made as the pace of her inhales and exhales began to slow and the sleep won out.</p><p>For the briefest moment, there was a whisper in the back of Agatha's mind.</p><p>
<i>Leave.</i>
</p><p>And for that moment, she almost listened.</p><p>Instead, a conscious inner voice, the louder one, spat back.</p><p>
<i>No, I'm going to stay.</i>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>There was only one thought that circled through Agatha's mind as she slowly began to rouse to consciousness.</p><p>
<i>I probably shouldn't have had those last two drinks.</i>
</p><p>Her head was throbbing, creating a pulsing of white light on the backs of her eyelids and her stomach felt a little uneasy in the way that if she moved too fast, she might actually puke. So instead, she simply laid there for a few long moments while she tried to gain her bearings.</p><p>The closer she got to being alert, the easier it was for her to identify that something was not right. Not that it was wrong, but there was an earthy yet sweet scent drifting into her nostrils. The blanket beneath her was fleece instead of her own cotton duvet. The pillow beneath her head was the wrong firmness.</p><p>Agatha was not at home.</p><p>Her eyes flew open at the realization to take in a nightstand she did not recognize from her position face down on the bed, left cheek pressed to that wrong pillow. The sun was pouring in the widows through sheer under curtains and as she laid still, only her eyes moving as they tried to place the room, she had no fucking clue where she was.</p><p>She had been so focused on the present that she had not yet begun to head backwards, to think about what the hell had landed her there.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>
<i>Oh.</i>
</p><p>Her last actually vivid memory was sitting at that bar.</p><p>With Rio.</p><p>The slightly foggier moments lent her a decent understanding; flashes of skin and moans and kissing and damn near carnal fucking slid by in rapid succession that seemed to blur them even further.</p><p>She'd stayed at Rio's?</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>So then... Where was Rio?</p><p>Slowly, Agatha began to shift, careful to not move too fast as to not aggravate the absolute jackhammer going off in her head. She pushed herself onto her side and then her back, an annoyed sigh passing through her lips as her eyes fell to the ceiling.</p><p>What had she been thinking?</p><p>Even drunk, she could have found a way home.</p><p>But she had stayed.</p><p>She laid there like that for a few long moments trying to figure out how she was going to make a quick and seamless exit. In the middle of her self-flagellation, a sound nearly scared her soul right out of her body.</p><p>Rio sneezed.</p><p>Agatha immediately launched into a sitting position, though the speed of which left her in an active battle to not completely vomit. As she centered herself and choked down the nausea, her eyes searched the room wildly, but finally landed on Rio as she sat, still naked, in an office chair facing the bed.</p><p>Her bruised knees were pulled up, heels of her feet tucked against the underside of her ass and there was something in her lap as well as a pencil in her hand. She was watching Agatha in her state of disorientation, the smallest little smile curling her lips.</p><p>Immediately, Agatha bristled.</p><p>"Take a picture, it'll last longer," she grumbled, bringing a hand up to rub at her face, though as she did so, she winced the moment her palm made contact with her left cheekbone.</p><p>What the fuck was that?</p><p>As Rio saw it when Agatha lowered her hand and raised a finger to poke at the spot, Rio's face immediately fell and she closed the book in her lap and tossed it onto the desk behind her before she rushed over and knelt onto the bed. Her immediate reaction had been to reach for Agatha's chin so that she could inspect it better, but for just a moment Agatha recoiled. That seemed to hurt Rio's feelings.</p><p>"Let me look," Rio pleaded softly, more cautious as she raised her hand again.</p><p>This time, Agatha did not pull away.</p><p>"Fuck, Agatha, I'm so sorry. I did <i>not</i> mean to give you a black eye." There was something about the tenderness of Rio's tone, the way the apology was heavy in her words that melted Agatha the slightest bit.</p><p>That was why she was there.</p><p>Rio's ability to care had suckered her right in. It had from the very first moment she'd laid barely-conscious eyes on her, even if at that moment it had been mandated by the predicament they had found themselves in after Agatha's accident.</p><p>But then, Rio had cared with popsicles.</p><p>Then, Rio had cared by agreeing to lunch.</p><p>Rio went on to care by buying Agatha a book of poetry she had not yet read, one that was sitting on the corner of her desk at home.</p><p>Finally, Rio had cared enough to pull Agatha out of that dark and dreary townhome and remind her what it was like to just indulge in conversation and share a few drinks with someone.</p><p>Someone, Agatha still thought even in her panic, who was so beautiful.</p><p>"It's okay," Agatha dismissed softly as she reached up to take hold of Rio's hand, lowering it from her face. As she went to let go, though, Rio slid her fingers into the spaces between Agatha's and another surge of panic lodged in her throat. She cleared it away before she spoke again. "I'll wear my glasses to class. It'll cover it up enough to not make it noticeable."</p><p>She was trying to be nonchalant, but it had to be clear to Rio that something inside of Agatha was uneasy.</p><p>What she said when she spoke next indicated to Agatha that it was.</p><p>"I'm going to hop in the shower. I have a shift at one. But... Just don't leave before I get out, okay?" Rio requested softly, those dark honey eyes practically bleeding with the desperation of her question.</p><p>Agatha could feel, the moment she realized what Rio was asking for, as her stomach squeezed so hard she was concerned for a second that she might actually throw up.</p><p>Despite that feeling, she swallowed hard again and gave a gentle nod.</p><p>"I won't, but... I will need to scour the house for my clothes. So... if I'm not in here, I'm just looking for my stuff," Agatha returned and she could hear it in her own voice as it came out a little stronger that it was beginning to lose that thick panic that had been gripping her since she woke up.</p><p>Rio gave a nod of understanding, but what she did next threw Agatha for such a loop that for the umpteenth time in several minutes, she thought she might be sick yet again.</p><p>Rio leaned forward and pressed her lips to Agatha's in a kiss that seemed <i>way too sweet</i> for whatever it was that had landed them there.</p><p>Agatha's eyes did not close. Instead, she was staring at Rio's eyelids as her heart was suddenly beating somewhere in the confines of her esophagus. Somehow, she managed enough gumption to put <i>some</i> effort into returning the kiss, but the shock that was sparking through her entire body limited what she was capable of.</p><p>Even more stunning was the look on Rio's face as she pulled away. Her cheeks were pink and pushed up by the most innocent and affectionate smile Agatha had ever seen her wear.</p><p>"I'll be quick," she promised and was off the bed in an instant, grabbing the small pile of scrubs she had already laid out for herself before she disappeared into the adjoining bathroom, leaving the door cracked in her wake.</p><p>Agatha's lips twisted nervously as she stared at the small space between the door and the frame, raking herself over the coals relentlessly over the fact that this was even a situation she had found herself in.</p><p>In grand total, she knew she had probably spent somewhere from seven to eight hours in Rio's presence, at least conscious, no matter how drunk they were. It wasn't even enough to constitute half of a day's worth of consideration, but Agatha had broken her own cardinal rule.</p><p>She had stayed.</p><p>With that rule broken, she was feeling guarded and nervous. If she was so willing to disregard her own structure and code, what else could that mean?</p><p>As she became more alert, those fuzzy memories from the night before seemed to clear up a little bit.</p><p>They passed by a little slower this time, a cascade of kissing, bumping, pinning. Rio's hands on her body had felt godly, but touching Rio had seemed to intensify that feeling tenfold. Being the reason Rio made the sounds she did? Being the reason that Rio had apparently been fucked so <i>well</i> that Agatha had landed herself a black eye? It was a confidence boost of the highest measure in a way that left Agatha feeling absolutely torn.</p><p>That had been fun, without question. It was... <i>this</i> that had Agatha in knots.</p><p>It was waking up in a bed that was not her own for the first time in a very long time. It was the way her heart had jumped out of her chest when Rio had sneezed. It was the absolute coiling of her insides when Rio leaned forward and kissed her like that, like this was something they'd done a million times.</p><p>Every single move Rio made unsettled Agatha but it was only because it was every single thing Agatha had hoped someone might do for her someday.</p><p>As it so happened, someday was that day.</p><p>Something else filled Agatha's mind with her next breath.</p><p>Rio had been writing something at that desk, naked in that chair. Agatha's eyes dropped to the book on the desk and indecision ripped through her like wildfire.</p><p>She wanted to see what it was. She wanted to know what Rio had been penning down as Agatha had laid buck naked on top of her comforter.</p><p>She battled herself for several long moments before she exhaled a huff of determination and pushed herself off the edge of the bed, padding over to the desk. There, on the corner, was a teal bound book that was too large to be literature, but there was no indication of what it was on the cover. Somewhere inside, there were a couple of loose leaves of paper, so that was where Agatha began.</p><p>With a timid reach, she slid her fingers between the loose pages and bound ones and flipped the book open, her breath catching entirely near the base of her throat at what she saw.</p><p>There, sketched in the gentle greys of graphite, was a drawing of... Well, Agatha.</p><p>Agatha in all of her glory, face down on that bed.</p><p>It started at her knees, lining the curve of her ass into her toned back, which Rio had shaded pretty appropriately. Her arms were up and tucked beneath the pillow and all that was visible through the mass of wild hair was the very tip of her nose.</p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p>
<i>What the fuck?</i>
</p><p>Rio had told her she liked to sketch. She hadn't told her that she was <i>really</i> good at it.</p><p>At the same time, Agatha was an artist in a different medium.</p><p>While her first inclination was to pull inward, Agatha had to stop and ask herself if that would have been fair given half of the musings and lines she had scribbled down those first few days after her accident, the ones that wouldn't leave her alone every time she thought about the pretty doctor.</p><p>And now, the pretty doctor was drawing pictures of Agatha naked in bed after the first day they'd spent together.</p><p>
<i>Fuck.</i>
</p><p>She was in trouble.</p><p>She took a steadying breath, trying to do what she could to clear her head. She had to think about this objectively. They were two very similar people. Yes, they had only spent a small amount of time together, but in that time it had become very obvious that there was <i>something</i> there between them, put forth by a valiant effort on Rio's part.</p><p>Rio was showering Agatha with attention she could almost swear she had never known before.</p><p>Nicky had been Agatha's. She had not needed attention or a relationship to make him happen. Least of all, Agatha had never needed a man. She had worked hard, barely sleeping for days on end so that she could save the money she had needed to invest in the medical treatments that eventually gave him to her.</p><p>Agatha had made him all on her own, she had raised him all on her own.</p><p>Agatha had also lost him all on her own, too.</p><p>As the softest choked sob rumbled up her throat, Agatha's hand clapped to her mouth to keep the sound from reaching the air, nevermind the fact that with Rio in the shower, she probably wouldn't have heard it anyway.</p><p>Thinking about how truly deprived of affection she had been had spiraled into thinking about Nicky, into missing him for the briefest moment. That pain was always sharp, but right then the damage had been worse because it hadn't been expected.</p><p>Slowly, she shut the sketchbook and forced herself into motion to search for her discarded articles of clothing. She had been successful in recovering about 95% of it, but the location of her lace panties completely eluded her. While normally, this would have irritated her, she simply shrugged and pulled her skirt back on.</p><p>Whatever, it wasn't like her place was too far away anyway, and it was a Saturday morning. She had nowhere else to be that would demand she be in panties.</p><p>She had stood at the base of the stairs on the second floor, staring up them as she debated hotly within herself whether or not to go back up.</p><p>Rio had asked her not to leave. She hadn't begged, but it was pretty close to a plea.</p><p>Agatha would actually feel like an asshole if she snuck out at that moment.</p><p>Her hand fell to the railing and she made her way back to the third floor, awkwardly placing herself on the edge of the bed right around the same time she heard the water shut off. Agatha pulled out her phone in an attempt to look busy whenever Rio emerged, but she couldn't seem to help the way that her eyes would flicker just briefly to the cracked bathroom door, as if some thought in her head was that Rio was going to walk out stark naked and crawl into her lap again.</p><p>While Agatha would have not put it past her entirely, Rio had clearly stated she had to work.</p><p>Finally, after another few minutes, the door pulled open and Rio emerged wearing her teal scrubs and her hair tied up and pinned into a damp but tight bun at the back of her head.</p><p>
<i>God, she really was so fucking beautiful, especially in the late morning sun.</i>
</p><p>For a flicker of a moment, Agatha felt this strange mixture of awe and nerves winding through her.</p><p>"I see you managed to dress yourself," Rio teased as she moved toward a dresser to rummage through a jewelry box. Agatha could see the glint of the pin she had pulled from it, though Rio did not immediately stick it in her hair. She turned to face Agatha, that warm curling of her lips sending a feather light grace of emotion through Agatha's chest. "Do you have everything you need?"</p><p>Agatha fought the urge to divert her gaze and offered a gentle nod as she got to her feet, feeling a little less steady on those heels than she had the night before. She was quiet as she followed Rio out of the room and down the stairs, though once on the second floor, Rio held up a finger and asked for a moment.</p><p>Agatha's gaze followed her as she went down the hallway and opened the door to a room that was filled with a strange light, one that was not produced by sun.</p><p>Though some part of her knew she shouldn't, Agatha's footsteps were soft as she edged further down the hallway until she could peer into the room.</p><p>What she saw stole her breath for the second time that morning.</p><p>In that room were special lights that Agatha was certain cost a fortune, but what they illuminated was far more grand.</p><p>The room, that looked like it may have once been two rooms, was filled almost end to end with potting tables that supported several different blooms of flowers. There were the snapdragons that Agatha had caught sight of when she had saved Rio from being run over. A little ways down, there were a patch of blue lilacs like the one she'd been sporting at the bar.</p><p>There were even more, like the small pot filled with hibiscus or the longer one that had African violets.</p><p>This was a <i>project.</i> Even more than that, an absolute passion project. All of those different flowers needed a lot of different things to grow, and it was clear by the supplies in the back corner that this was something Rio invested a lot of herself and her time into.</p><p><i>"Holy shit,"</i> Agatha breathed as Rio plucked one of the violets. Her head lifted and turned over her shoulder to see Agatha standing in the door way, completely confounded by what she was witnessing. <i>"I can't believe this is in your fucking house. Your electric bill must be fucking outrageous."</i></p><p>Rio's grin was sweeping and bright as she turned around to head back toward the door. With such fluidity and not even needing to look at herself in a mirror, she raised both hands to secure the flower with that ornate pin just above her ear.</p><p>All at once, Agatha could feel the softening taking over her again.</p><p>This woman... This incredibly smart, incredibly insightful, insanely beautiful woman truly was a piece of art. Everything she did, it painted a picture of the complexity of who she was as a human being. She was a healer, she was generous, she was witty, she was an <i>incredible</i> lover. And there she was, pinning a flower in her hair that she had grown in an indoor greenhouse in her three story condo in the middle of Boston on her way out the door to undoubtedly save at least one life that day.</p><p>Who the fuck was this woman and what on earth made her so interested in Agatha?</p><p>"It's just a hobby," Rio dismissed, clearly downplaying that it was something she cared a great deal about.</p><p>"Yeah, okay. I don't spend tens of thousands of dollars on my <i>hobby</i>, but whatever you say, Doctor."</p><p>This earned Agatha a narrowed glance from Rio, though her smile was still present, if a little softer.</p><p>"I don't like it when you call me that. You know my name. And had little trouble moaning it last night." Rio's tone was even, but Agatha could tell she was being both honest and admonishing. At the same time, the content of the sentence caused a familiar throbbing to kick up between Agatha's legs beneath her skirt.</p><p>Damn her.</p><p>"Okay, Rio," Agatha corrected herself and while it might have normally been a taunt, Agatha meant it this time.</p><p>She was growing frustrated with herself; this absolute back and forth in her own head was exhausting but the indecision felt absolutely insurmountable. She wanted to let her guard down, let herself be interested in this absolute catch of a human being, but that little voice in the back of her head said it was too soon to consider anything past what the next few nights of their time together might look like.</p><p>That was a step. Agatha was allowing herself to think a couple of dates in the future. Would they actually happen? Who knew, but in the event that it might, Agatha could feel that tiny heat of blind hope.</p><p>Rio placed the back of her hand to Agatha's stomach as she crossed into the hallway, pushing her a little so that she had the room to exit.</p><p>Agatha simply stared at her, brow pinched in assessment of who, exactly, this woman thought she was.</p><p>Instead, Rio kept going and only stopped when she reached the top of the stairs and glanced back.</p><p>"Come on," she requested softly. Agatha stepped forward and followed her the rest of the way down, hesitating as they reached the bottom and Rio departed for the kitchen. "Are you sure you don't want an iced coffee to take with you?" she called over her shoulder as she set to making one for herself.</p><p>"No thank you," Agatha returned, though her tone was soft from the offer.</p><p>In the time it took Rio to make her coffee, Agatha had pulled out her phone and requested a ride that was due in only a couple of minutes. She was shoving her phone back into the pocket of her peacoat by the time Rio approached and held out the cup for Agatha to hold so she could put her own coat on.</p><p>Obediently, Agatha took it and did as was silently requested of her, gripping the steel in her palm as her eyes never left Rio. The grace with which she moved was almost art in and of itself, but Agatha had caught herself staring. She diverted her eyes, landing on a photo that sat on the table in the foyer.</p><p>It was old, probably by at least thirty or so years. In it, there was a man and a woman and between them sat a little girl wearing a flower crown in a pink frilly dress. Before she could curb the impulse, Agatha spoke.</p><p>"Is that you and your parents?" she asked, her eyes lifting back to Rio's face.</p><p>"It is. I was seven."</p><p>Agatha finally made an active choice to let her resolve slip the slightest bit, at least in a way that was obvious to Rio.</p><p>"It's... nice that you've kept up the tradition," Agatha pointed out, indicating what she meant as she waved a hand in the direction of the African violet that was pinned in Rio's hair. What she did not do was ask why. Maybe that could be a conversation for a later date.</p><p>Rio offered her another small curl of those full lips and a gentle nod of her head in silent acknowledgement as she reached for the cup and took it back.</p><p>"So... you can't tell me you walk to work," Agatha mused, tipping her head in question.</p><p>"I don't. I have a scheduled ride that I had enough sense to make last night before we met at the bar."</p><p>"Smart girl."</p><p>"It should be here any minute," she disclosed, checking the smart watch on her wrist in a way that was not entirely dissimilar from how she had done it the night before, even inebriated.</p><p>Something about the entire five seconds it took all of that to happen, Agatha could feel her stomach sinking at the thought that they were going to part ways, and she did not know the next time she was going to see Rio again.</p><p>"Right," Agatha agreed with a curt nod. "Mine should be here soon, too."</p><p>Without another word, Rio let them out into the cold late morning, the wind whipping Agatha's hair wildly before she had a chance to tame it.</p><p>There, sitting at the curb were two cars. This made them both laugh as they understood they were about to play a quick game of who was there for who.</p><p>Agatha had started to head down the stairs but didn't even make it to the first one as Rio reached out, first turning her by her arm and then grabbing the insides of Agatha's open coat. This forced Agatha to look her in the eyes in a way that made the nerves grip around her spine, causing her to tighten.</p><p>"I work a lot this week, but I'm off early on Thursday. Can we go out to dinner?"</p><p>Agatha was hit with a sudden punch to the chest that this was still something Rio actively wanted. It was jarring to have assumed that last night was a one-off at best to be looked at like that and asked for more time. Though there was a brief silence as Agatha seemed to process and compute and have a slight battle within her own mind, it was quickly won by the same voice that had compelled her to stay the night before.</p><p>"Yes, Rio, I would love to go out to dinner with you on Thursday evening."</p><p>That impossibly bright smile whipped across Rio's lips like a bolt of lightning and the dull grey light of the day shone in her eyes as if it had come directly from the sun itself.</p><p>Rio gave a gentle pull of Agatha's coat, tugging her forward and met her halfway with a sweet but intentional kiss. A moment later, their lips separated and Agatha could swear she could faintly still tase the mouthwash Rio had used on her breath.</p><p>"Even though I probably won't be able to see you until then, I put my number in your coat pocket in case you forgot to save it. So... don't be a stranger," she informed Agatha, those eyes still dancing with the light of the morning. She leaned in once more, this time pressing her lips to Agatha's cheek. "Have a good day, Agatha."</p><p>"You too, Rio."</p><p>And as Agatha stood there, watching as Rio parsed which car was the correct one for her, and a thought struck her that shocked the absolute hell out of her.</p><p>
<i>Can it be Thursday now?</i>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>As Agatha let herself into the townhome that had been empty since she'd left the night before to make her date with Rio, she did not feel anywhere near the same woman who had walked out of it.</p><p>She hated admitting that to herself.</p><p>She hated admitting that she'd left with the slight hope that if nothing else, they'd get a little drunk, have sex, and Agatha would be on her way, surely to never hear from or speak to Rio again.</p><p>What she hadn't expected was how much Rio's drunken giggle would make her heart flutter. She hadn't expected the way she felt enchanted when Rio had talked at-length about something she was passionate about. She never could have imagined that she would see stars in Rio's eyes even before they'd crossed into the territory of having had too much to drink.</p><p>What Agatha had not anticipated was the way she woke up, thighs slightly bruised and with a black eye, in someone else's bed.</p><p>Agatha didn't do attachment. It was painful because at some point, it had to end. Nothing guaranteed the continuance of life, nothing promised another tomorrow. She could step outside on a stormy day and get hit by lightning and that would just be it. It could happen to anyone, and for that, Agatha was always sure to keep her distance.</p><p>Loss had become the catalyst in Agatha's isolation and it had become integral to who she had evolved into as a person. Even laying down roots in Boston hadn't ever actually <i>done</i> anything for her other than make her feel like an animal trapped in a cage.</p><p>At least, not until she got hit by that car and... all of whoever the hell Rio Vidal was bulldozed her way into Agatha's life.</p><p>That was what Rio was doing. She was razing Agatha's protective keep to the ground. She was demolishing every bit of Agatha's guard, her armor, her defenses. Rio was running around unloading all of the weapons without Agatha's knowledge so that when it came time for Agatha to fire back, she was holding a dead gun. The spark of flint happened, but there was no powder to catch. Rio was depleting her of her munitions in a way she wasn't ready for.</p><p>Agatha was always armed in the metaphorical sense, but in the course of twenty-four hours, she walked through that front door and felt like she'd been stripped of every single weapon she'd been carrying when she had left the night before. She had not even recognized at what point she had decided to lay down her arms, but now she felt like she was not suitable to protect herself.</p><p>What the fuck kind of identity crisis was that?</p><p>One only Agatha Harkness could have, apparently.</p><p>Agatha was a woman who had weaponized solitude. She had occupied the beds of women whose names she did not remember. She had taken up trades because she could. She had stayed up too late drinking whiskey from the bottle while she scribbled in her notebooks about the things she saw, the people she tangled with, and how through it all she was still simply so alone.</p><p>Now, as the door shut behind her and she turned the lock, she looked at those walls with their cheap and meaningless art, their dull colors, their utter plainness and she ached for even the most miniscule splash of color.</p><p>She wouldn't have admitted it, but it was absolutely because of Rio.</p><p>After a brief moment of further introspection, Agatha finally began to move, to operate like she was a human being instead of some mindless sap who was too emotionally invested in someone she'd spent a single day with.</p><p>The heels she had been wearing hit the ground with soft <i>thuds</i> and she simply left them there as she climbed the stairs and headed straight for the shower.</p><p>That had been informative.</p><p>During the process of washing off the night before, Agatha found several spots that were not going to wash off. There were four small bruises along the haunch of her hip that depicted the four perfectly spaced places where Rio's fingers had been when Agatha had been knelt on that couch.</p><p>That caused a familiar heat to pool at the base of her spine. In turn, the pulse of a kickdrum began right in her middle.</p><p>The memories were still blurred at the edges, no matter how hard she put forth the effort of trying to clear them, but there was enough of them there that she wanted to get a little lost in what she could conjure.</p><p>The most vivid one, somehow despite being the one that happened in the throes of her being absolutely smashed, was the one of Rio knelt on those stairs. The moonlight had poured in from an overhead window, illuminating every sweet and delicious curve of her ass down to where thighs turned to knees.</p><p>The sheer thrill that had come with the act of sliding that lace over the smoothest skin was something that Agatha was sure she would be stuck on for some time, or what she could cling to of the memory.</p><p>The longer she delved into the depth of it, the more she began to slip. She was devolving the longer she thought about the taste of Rio on her tongue. She was losing her grip on her sense of rationale when she dug deep enough to recall what it felt like to be inside of her, to feel her every tense and tremble her body had to offer.</p><p>Her chest had started to move with a bit more fervor and the moment she attempted to relive that look on Rio's face as she sat against that couch, she was entirely undone. A hand flew up and deftly freed the showerhead from the clip it sat in. The moment she had it, she flipped the plastic tab to change the pressure it was putting out to something with a little more force.</p><p>Adjusting her position, she hiked a leg up so that she could slide her foot onto the corner of the tub at the foot of the shower. The hand that wasn't clutching the shower head slid down her body so that she could create enough surface area as she lowered the shower head, the targeted stream of water jettisoned out to make contact with her clit.</p><p>The initial hit of force caused her head to tip back, a ragged moan slipping between her lips as her mind's eye rolled through the footage of what it was like to have the view of the Cassatt painting of lilacs that hung over the back of that couch as she felt every inch of Rio's mouth on her. As it turned out, the muscle memory was better than the one her brain had been able to log.</p><p>She shifted slightly, trying to find a better angle for the shower head, and when she did, it was at the precise moment she remembered what it felt like when Rio had pushed inside of her.</p><p>Those two things coupled caused Agatha to lean forward, her forehead pressing to the cool tile of the shower wall as the pressure in her middle began to build.</p><p>But then, natural progression happened and she followed the timeline further. The way Rio had laid atop her, their skin hot and sticky from sweat as it pressed flush together. The way Rio had clung to her as she had carried her up the stairs. The way she had looked up at her in the pale moonlight and beguiled her to stay -- <i>oh!</i></p><p>Despite the fact that Agatha would have insisted that thinking of those moments would have done nothing but irritated her, they were instead the very cause of the orgasm that shot through every nerve she had. It was not only unexpected, but it had been a little too sudden for where she had thought she was in the process.</p><p>Her deep and low moan seemed to echo perfectly in the acoustics of that bathroom, so much so that she was glad that the walls between homes were thick. Perhaps they could have used some sound-proofing, but no one had started banging in protest. After the moment it took her to catch her breath and steady her trembling legs, Agatha righted herself and placed the shower head back where it belonged.</p><p>Even as she shut the water off, her chest was still heaving slightly. It might have been more indicative of the panic she was beginning to feel than it was of the orgasm she was in great conflict over.</p><p>What the fuck was going on with her?</p><p>All that delicious memory of what it was like to be absolutely primal with someone who could keep pace, and she came at the thought of someone being fucking nice to her?!</p><p>As it turned out, it wasn't the first time it happened that week.</p><p>In fact, part of that had been her own fault.</p><p>By eight o'clock that night, Agatha had spent a total of almost three hours staring at her phone, trying to decide what to text Rio. She'd even opened the conversation that still was just Rio's lone word of 'Hey.' She'd stared at it, would raise a finger to hover over the screen for just a moment, and would then lower her hand as her lips twisted roughly over her own indecision.</p><p>Another five minutes and impulsivity won out.</p><p>Agatha stood from her spot at the little dining room table and peeled her t-shirt over her head. She'd had no other intention of leaving the house that evening and so she'd been able to forego the hassle of dealing with a bra.</p><p>She took a deep breath as she opened the camera app.</p><p>This was ridiculous.</p><p>But it was better than not saying anything at all.</p><p>Agatha held her arm out and and positioned her phone in a way that just the very bottom part of her nose was visible and her teeth sank into her bottom lip on the right side. Everything between her chin to the upper portion of her abdomen was visible, her breasts on full display in every bit of their glory.</p><p>Just before she took the picture, the corner of her mouth curled up slightly, a hint of deviousness almost out of frame.</p><p>She was satisfied and sent it, watching as the little checkmark appeared to notify of its delivery.</p><p>Five minutes passed. Then ten. Then twenty.</p><p>She had since put her shirt back on and even made herself a cup of the Winterberry loose-leaf tea she'd gotten in her monthly subscription box. Wrapping her fingers around the amethyst end of the strainer, she pulled the mesh ball out of the water and popped it open, dumping the remainder of the leaves into the trash. As she returned to the table, her eyes dropped at the exact same time her phone lit up, Rio's name on the text bubble.</p><p>She blew a breath into the sip of tea she was taking, causing some of it to splash on her face, still so very hot.</p><p><i>"Fuck,"</i> she hissed, setting the mug down without slamming it so she could wipe at her face. She then wiped her hand on her pants so that it was dry enough to unlock her phone. What met her was enough to cause the biggest smirk to wind its way up her face.</p><p>
<i>"JESUS FUCKING CHRIST AGATHA!"</i>
</p><p>There was a little blurb below it that indicated that Rio was typing again.</p><p>
<i>"I DROPPED MY PHONE IN MY GODDAMN MUG OF COFFEE!"</i>
</p><p>Agatha stared down at her phone for a moment in thought. Her response was simple:</p><p>
<i>"Guess I didn't have anything worth saying."</i>
</p><p>Rio's quip back came in an instant.</p><p>
<i>"You're a terrible poet."</i>
</p><p>And so had begun a routine. Agatha would attempt to hold a conversation but she was well aware that Rio had better things to be doing than trying to hold something of substance over text. It just wasn't practical. So, when Agatha became restless enough, she'd strip down -- or sometimes already was -- and find an inventive new way to capture her body.</p><p>The first couple of times, she'd still had a bit of nerves, but the more she went about it, the more creative she got, it seemed to be building other reservoirs of confidence within her. She kept it to only a couple a day, but she was still having her fun.</p><p>Other facets of her life started to change, too. The following day when she went to the market, she had been unable to keep herself from the additional purchase of a small bouquet of flowers and a vase to put them in. She'd sold it to herself has needing to add a splash of color to her home, but it wasn't true. She got them because they reminded her of Rio. Admitting as much, though, wasn't something that was going to happen in the space she was currently occupying in her own mind.</p><p>Even as she slipped into a boutique on Tuesday afternoon after her lecture, she wouldn't have told anyone why she was there. She found the display of perfumes and while it would have appeared to anyone who was looking in from the outside that she was simply shopping, looking for something she liked, that was not what she was doing.</p><p>No, Agatha was hunting.</p><p>Agatha was seeking something out specifically and after she had brought nearly every bottle on display to her nose to try and identify it, she ended up walking out disappointed and without what she had been searching for. Even if she didn't buy it for herself, something in Agatha had to know what perfume it was that Rio wore. It was idiotic, she realized as she climbed out of the back of her ride and shut the door.</p><p>She had fought the urge to go to another store the next day when she left her office and instead returned home to make herself a quick dinner and lounge around with something mindless on the television in the living room as she flipped through her messages with Rio. She often lingered on the one she'd sent to Rio that had gone unacknowledged.</p><p>
<i>"One of these days I'm going to get a hospital bathroom/scrub version of these, I just know it."</i>
</p><p>She had almost expected a quip about how that was 'unprofessional' at the very least. It had never come, though. Instead, Rio just ignored it completely.</p><p>Agatha could respect it. It was a silent decline of the challenge and that was fair enough. That didn't mean it was going to make Agatha stop, though. Rio was surely aware that if she was over it, all she had to do was say the word.</p><p>Even Thursday morning, Agatha had taken the moment during getting dressed to send another photo of herself that showcased her genuine grin, this time. She sent it, but there was a caption attached:</p><p>
<i>"See you tonight. Don't be late. xx"</i>
</p><p>She'd gone about getting ready for her day, but when she had picked up her phone, the smile that filled her face was almost instant.</p><p>
<i>"Like I'd pass up an opportunity to take that home. See you tonight."</i>
</p><p>Agatha's grin had been plastered to her lips from that moment on for nearly the rest of the day, only tamed when she knew she had to be professional in front of a hall full of students.</p><p>The purple that had been beneath her right eye had slowly started to fade into green, but it was still pretty well masked by the frame of the large glasses she often donned. As it turned out, they were the right ones for the job.</p><p>Class that day had honestly been the only time Agatha had been able to focus on anything but the night ahead of her. It was so distracting and also a little unnerving. She felt like she was in high school again, having crushes on girls that were out of her league.</p><p>Rio could not have been any more out of her league, in any sense that went past just the physical. The physical, Agatha knew she could keep up. The physical, that was Agatha's stomping grounds. However, the part Rio played up with the brief shows of affection, the little comments she would throw into text about how pretty Agatha's eyes were or how much she liked it when she laughed, those were what made Agatha feel like she was playing in the minors.</p><p>Agatha knew she was a beautiful woman and she knew that she carried herself with such confidence. So then what made it so hard to not blush when it came from Rio?</p><p>What was it about Rio, who she'd hardly spent any time with at all, that seemed to dismantle her steady shield that she'd always so proudly brandished?</p><p>After office hours, she'd made her way back home with plenty of time to prepare for their date. Something about it had her nervous again, but this time it was different. This time it wasn't just drinking at a bar, wasn't just shooting the shit and passing little details back and forth that rarely got discussed.</p><p>This was dinner.</p><p>This was formal.</p><p>This time, however, Agatha had decided to take a page out of Rio's book.</p><p>She showered and dried her hair before slipping into a black turtleneck that was worn under a navy blue suit. She thumbed through a jewelry box until she found what she was looking for. Agatha pulled it out and fastened the gold chain around her neck over the fabric of the sweater.</p><p>Stepping in front of the mirror, her eyes swept the reflection from toe to head and caught sight of that still green bruise on the apple of her cheek. Right. Glasses were not optional tonight unless she wanted people to assume that Rio was abusive.</p><p>That thought was actually hysterical, and it showed in the way Agatha laughed to herself in the stillness of the townhome.</p><p>She slid the dark frames onto her face and took one last look in the mirror, deciding that she was satisfied.</p><p>Once her coat was on, Agatha started for the door but then stopped herself, doubling back to the dining room to snatch one of the lilies out of the vase. She knew it was stupid, knew that it was the artist, the poet, in her that couldn't resist. It wasn't a flower that was suitable enough to be adorned like a crown, as most of the ones Rio wore were, but Agatha thought there to be a kindness in the gesture.</p><p>She had arrived at Lulu Green at 8 pm as they had agreed, but found a line forming in her brow when, by 8:05, Rio was still not there. It was cold, so Agatha decided to head inside and grab them a table, but something began to gnaw away at the pit of her stomach the longer time wore on. By 8:10, Agatha decided to text her, worried if nothing else.</p><p>
<i>"Hey... Is everything okay?" </i>
</p><p>She sent it and set her phone down, tending to the glass of prosecco she had ordered to try and wash away those little flickers of nerves that were beginning to multiply.</p><p>It was 8:34 by the time she got a response.</p><p>
<i>"Hey, I'm SO sorry. We had an influx of patients from an accident. I'm here for another hour at least. I'm so sorry. Order what you want. I'll Venmo you the money."</i>
</p><p>Agatha's lips turned down at the corners and a disappointed sigh passed through her lips. On the next inhale, though, she was hit with an idea. She was quick to type her reply.</p><p>
<i>"What do you even get here? I wouldn't know where to begin."</i>
</p><p>Rio managed a pretty quick reply, playing right into Agatha's hand.</p><p>
<i>"I really like the Korean lettuce wraps. You should try them."</i>
</p><p>
<i>"Will do. Have a good night, Rio."</i>
</p><p>The moment she hit send, she dropped the phone and flagged down the waiter and informed him she would be placing her order to go. She'd ordered the lettuce wraps for Rio and then the Pastor tacos for herself. The waiter gave her a nod and informed her he would return when the food was ready and packaged.</p><p>It gave her the time she needed to finish her wine and wonder if what she was going to do would be too much. Would it be crossing the very thin line that they were trying to keep between them?</p><p>Was that line even real or was it only in her mind?</p><p>After about twenty minutes, the waiter returned with the bag and took her card to pay. She'd tipped him well before she got to her feet and slid her coat back on as the notification on her phone vibrated to alert her of the arrival of the car she had requested.</p><p>The drive to Rio's wasn't too impossibly far, but to Agatha it felt like it dragged on for an eternity. In a way, she wished it would have been. What she knew she was going to end up doing... it was dangerous. It was bordering on completely insane.</p><p>Still, as the car rolled to a stop in front of Rio's apartment, Agatha glanced up at the structure and took a breath that she had hoped might quiet some of her nerves. It seemed to work for a moment as she hooked her fingers through the handle of the bag and she stepped out of the car, closing the door gently behind her before it pulled away and she was left to walk up to that condo. She reached the third step and decisively spun on her heel, lowering herself to the top one.</p><p>She kept her knees close to her chest to try to contain as much heat as she could on such a cold Boston night, but she hoped that it was going to be for the timeline she'd been given, though Agatha was already too aware that deadlines were likely going to have to be flexible when it came to Rio and her schedule.</p><p>There she had sat, ignoring the bite of the cold night air on her cheeks, ears and nose as she scrolled through her phone to keep herself busy. She thumbed through poems she had saved to her phone for a little while, and then through her gallery which was now filled with more photos of her own bare chest than it ever had been.</p><p>It should have been embarrassing, but it made Agatha grin like an idiot.</p><p>She spent some time googling exotic flowers and where to find them. She spent time researching different notes of different perfumes.</p><p>She'd been so pulled into her phone that she had not noticed as a car stopped at the curb and someone climbed out and gingerly shut the door.</p><p>She did not even notice as that person came a little closer, not until she heard her name.</p><p>"Agatha?"</p><p>Her eyes lifted with the sudden jerk of her head as she saw Rio there in her scrubs -- a little bloodier toward the end of the pants leg than they had been when she'd left for work, likely -- and bundled in her coat.</p><p>The smile that sprung to Agatha's face was scarily instant and also so easy that she wasn't quite sure how to process it in the moment.</p><p>"Agatha, what are you doing here?" Rio pressed, her tone a little hard though it didn't sound annoyed. It sounded... surprised.</p><p>"You couldn't come to dinner so I thought I'd bring dinner to you. I figured that you having to stay over might have left you especially famished. And I was told the lettuce wraps hold well for a little while."</p><p>Rio's expression seemed to melt despite the frigid temperature outside and she stepped forward as Agatha lifted herself to her feet, scooping the bag up in the crook of her fingers.</p><p>"You really shouldn't have..." Rio managed as she met Agatha evenly at the top of the steps, the look in her eyes speaking very loudly to Agatha just how touched Rio was.</p><p>"Maybe. But I wanted to. I also wanted to make sure you knew that I was fully aware that you were not standing me up. Your job is..."</p><p>"Demanding." The way Rio said it, it felt not only like a fact, but almost like a warning, too. It was Rio's way of letting Agatha know that this might not be the last time something of this nature occurred. Agatha could deal with that if it meant Rio might still be willing to entertain her even for a hour or so before she inevitably needed to sleep.</p><p>"A hurdle. I have great legs, though." Agatha flashed a toothy grin and somehow, Rio seemed to melt further.</p><p>"Yeah, you do," Rio agreed as she managed to unlock the door on the first go, this time.</p><p>As they made their way inside, Rio flipped on the light in the foyer before she began to shed her coat. Agatha, however, did not move to do the same. Instead, she saw Rio's face for the first time that night in the light and something in her sank. She looked exhausted. She looked like the day had absolutely run her ragged.</p><p>"I, um..." Agatha fumbled for the briefest moment, but she straightened up and found her voice. "I can just leave this here with you and we can try again another day. You should really get some sleep."</p><p>"Agatha," Rio returned and while her tone was not sharp, there was a trace of a scolding there. At the same time, she slipped the handle of the bag from Agatha's fingers into her own. "You're not going anywhere."</p><p>"But -- "</p><p>"We're going to go upstairs and we're going to eat this meal and then we'll figure it out from there."</p><p>"Are you sure?" Agatha questioned back, her tone a little softer in her obvious submission.</p><p>"Yes I'm sure. Would you grab me a water while I head up? There's tea in the cabinet if you want some. Electric kettle is by the fridge."</p><p>Agatha's posture slackened slightly.</p><p>"Take your coat off. Stay a while," Rio murmured at her, leaning in to do something that was becoming so classically Rio, and pressed her lips softly to Agatha's cheek.</p><p>With that, she departed and began her ascent up the stairs. There Agatha stood, coat still on, just watching as Rio disappeared around the curve of the landing.</p><p>After another moment, she shucked her coat and hung it in the small closet next to Rio's before she headed into the kitchen. Her first grab was the water bottle and then she moved to where the cabinets were. For a moment, Agatha just stared up at them. How the fuck was she supposed to know where to look?</p><p>It had only taken three tries before she saw the three boxes of tea -- chamomile, earl grey, and vanilla oolong -- on the bottom shelf.</p><p>What Agatha also noticed was that they were each still in the plastic wrapping that signified they had never been opened. Either that, or they were brand new.</p><p>The thought of having to wait for the water to boil deterred her, though, and she instead took a bottle of water for herself and made her way up to the third floor and down the hall to Rio's bedroom.</p><p>As Agatha stepped into the doorway, what she saw was enough to cause a warm blush to blossom across her sternum beneath that black sweater.</p><p>Rio was sat cross legged, in a fresh change of clothes, on the side of the bed she had slept on before, and she had very meticulously laid out their meals and utensils and napkins. She was finishing her prep and Agatha simply watched her for a moment longer. As Rio's eyes lifted though, she'd been busted.</p><p>Or, so she'd thought.</p><p>Instead, Rio turned the moment back on her. Her gaze dropped to Agatha's now bare feet and swept up over that navy ensemble and the turtleneck that clung to every single right spot on her torso. They lingered on that gold chain and finally found Agatha's suddenly self-conscious blue eyes.</p><p><i>"You look incredible. And it makes me <b>really</b> upset that I did not get to sit across a table from you in a really nice restaurant."</i> Rio's voice was so soft, but Agatha could hear that she meant every single word.</p><p>There was an obvious comprehension that what Rio did for a living was taxing in ways Agatha would never actually have the ability to understand. But hearing that Rio was not immune to the disappointment it could bring with it?</p><p>It was touching in a way that Agatha knew this would be a shared ache between them, one that they would tend to each time it bruised.</p><p>Agatha paced forward and slid onto the bed in front of the meal Rio had laid out for her, handing over one of the bottles of water. She crossed her own legs, too, making sure that her knee was pressed firmly to Rio's.</p><p>
<i>"That's okay. I like sitting next to you better anyway. Plus, I think we both know I'm gonna look way better out of this, too."</i>
</p><p>Rio's grin was visible even out of the corner of Agatha's eye.</p><p><i>"I think I underestimated you,"</i> Rio announced, popping the lid off of her food. In the next second, she reached around the empty bag and picked up the lily that Agatha had stowed in it when she had left the restaurant.</p><p><i>"Yeah? How so?"</i> Agatha posed back, though she pretended not to notice the flower.</p><p>
<i>"I thought it would take at least three dates for you to start being adorable."</i>
</p><p>Maybe a week ago, someone talking to her like that would have pissed Agatha off beyond measure.</p><p>Right then, could she really blame Rio? Agatha had sat outside of her apartment until almost ten at night if for no other reason than to show someone she found herself drawn to that she was capable of caring and somehow finding ways to show it.</p><p>
<i>"You say adorable, I say considerate. I respect what you do, probably more than most because I've been on the receiving end of it. You're going to have hard days. You made my hard day easier. I just want to do the same."</i>
</p><p>Rio reached over and placed her palm against Agatha's cheek, a silent request for her attention. Slowly, Agatha turned to meet her gaze, a wry smile twisting up her lips.</p><p><i>"Sometimes, when you start talking like that, it makes it easier to believe you're a poet,"</i> Rio murmured softly, but before it could draw any protest from Agatha, she leaned in and pressed their lips together in an undemanding kiss.</p><p>A recurring thought that Agatha frequently had when it came to Rio resurfaced again.</p><p>
<i>Damn her.</i>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>For those first few moments of being perched on that bed, legs crossed and still clad in that blue suit, Agatha asked herself what the hell she thought she was doing almost every single time Rio hummed softly in approval of the meal she was consuming.</p><p>How was Agatha the one that was perched there, purposely so close that their knees were touching? How was it Agatha that Rio had invited up to eat even though she was clearly exhausted? How was it possible that Rio had looked at her like <i>that</i> when she had placed herself in the doorway?</p><p>The mere thought of that look on Rio's face as she had surveyed what she had missed out on in a public setting had done something to Agatha that she held too much shame to admit. It had been this twisting, this constricting of parts of her she had forgotten even existed. Agatha was still in that battle of her own wills, wavering between loosening her grip and wanting to disappear into the shadows.</p><p>For the moment, the draw pulled her closer to Rio. It had led them to that moment where, as Agatha sat quietly and ate her dinner, she did not feel that ache in her muscles to run. She had done this because it was the right thing to do, because it had felt right in the moment. Sitting at that table, realizing that Rio was not going to show up, Agatha had not been disappointed. She hadn't been angry or even upset. She had just been... sad.</p><p>Being out with Rio at that bar had been one thing. That was a place where being close and getting closer as more alcohol was consumed was normal and even encouraged. Knowing that Rio wanted to sit somewhere in public with her and make people very aware that they were out <i>together</i> had been something else entirely. What was more was that Agatha found herself actually <i>liking</i> that idea, the one where someone cared about what the world thought enough to show her off.</p><p>Or was that just Agatha's deeply buried romantic heart trying to break through years of steel and concrete she had tried to cover it with?</p><p>Halfway through her meal, Agatha made the decision to remove her glasses. They kept sliding down her nose and it was just a needless irritation that she wanted to rid herself of. Plus, she didn't really need them anymore, anyway.</p><p>Rio noticed that she did this and put down her food so that she could shift a little.</p><p>"Let me see. Does it look any better?" Rio requested, causing Agatha to reluctantly turn her head.</p><p>Immediately, Rio's hand raised and light fingertips circled the area around the bruise below Agatha's eye. Rio's lips turned down at the corners as she surveyed the damage and Agatha could almost tell just by her posture that she hadn't forgiven herself for it yet.</p><p>"It's fine, Rio, really. It wasn't like you intentionally decked me. It was an accident." Agatha's voice was soft, but it was sincere, though her features were a little tight still. She didn't know what it was to be doted on, for someone to actually care that she was injured in any way and she was quickly scrambling to place it in the moment and let herself feel it instead of trying to avoid it.</p><p>"I should have given you ice to put on it," Rio remarked but Agatha shook her head.</p><p>"I wouldn't have let you."</p><p>This brought the smallest smile back to Rio's lips just before she returned to the rest of her food. After another couple of bites, she cleared her throat and looked down at the flower between them on the bed.</p><p>"Why did you bring it?" Rio asked, though she didn't lift her eyes to pin Agatha in a way that might make the question more uncomfortable for her than it already was. Then again, had she really needed to ask it in the first place?</p><p>"Because... You like flowers." Agatha stated it like it was common knowledge, like it was completely obvious, but she should have known that Rio was pushing for a deeper answer.</p><p>Agatha's lips worried to a point that the edges grew white and she was nearly biting them on the inside.</p><p>"I do. And...?"</p><p>"And... I like you."</p><p>Rio's posture shifted completely as she caught hold of her prize. Getting Agatha to speak, to admit things that she didn't want to admit seemed to be something Rio was considering a triumph. She was doing what she could to push Agatha in the right direction, into making her realize that for this to work, what she had to say had to mean something.</p><p>"Do you, now?" Rio responded, though she turned her head to take Agatha in, even if it dropped to the side at an angle. There was a beaming grin on her face and her eyes were so impossibly soft that it made Agatha weak somewhere in her middle.</p><p>Agatha turned back to her food and gave a gentle shrug. "Sometimes. And then other times, like y'know, right now... I start to question it."</p><p>"You say as we sit here eating a dinner you did not have to bring me with you still wearing your <i>very attractive</i> suit after you sat on my front step for who knows how long." Even though Agatha could hear the softness of Rio's words in the tone of voice she chose, there was still something about the obvious being thrust in her face that was making her squirm.</p><p>This was their second date and she was already so fucking out of character it was leaving her disoriented. She was letting this woman reach inside of her and touch part of her soul in ways she had <i>never</i> let happen. She was letting Rio sit there and call her out without immediately getting to her feet and bolting. She was letting <i>herself</i> make choices that she had never given a shit enough to make before.</p><p>None of it made any sense. That was where the hesitation stemmed from.</p><p>That and the un-watered pit in the bottom of her stomach where every bit of her doubt and lack of self-confidence in the more quieter moments lived.</p><p>Agatha was quiet a long time as she stared down at the remnants of her meal. She pushed it around a bit with her fork, lips finally turning down at the corners.</p><p>"It's okay to talk about it," Rio encouraged, her quiet murmur breaking through the silence around them.</p><p>Again, another long and drawn out silence where Agatha simply didn't know what to say. She contained multitudes when it came to knowing the best way to express herself and yet there she sat feeling so uncertain that not even words could cut it.</p><p>Finally, she found her voice or at least what of it she could.</p><p><i>"I don't do this, Rio,"</i>  she finally admitted aloud.</p><p>"'This' being...?" Rio returned, but her voice was still low and soft. It was hardly above a whisper.</p><p>Agatha's brow pulled tight and her chin tucked a little more, like she was finding a way to draw into herself without it being overt.</p><p>
<i>"Agatha..."</i>
</p><p><i>"This being... well, everything that this is turning out to be. I don't stay the night, but I stayed here. I don't date, but I let you take me on one. And then, I was going to go on another one with you. And you stood me up, even though I understood."</i> Agatha had slid the plastic fork over her middle finger but under the others as she'd started speaking. The tighter her fist clenched, the flimsier the plastic was proving to be. <i>"I would have normally gone home. I would have been angry. I would have written in my notebook and probably got a bottle of liquor from PostMates to chug until I fell asleep."</i></p><p>
<i>SNAP!</i>
</p><p>The utensil in her gasp cracked in half with the pressure she had been applying in her nerves. The way it split, though, caused a small gash to form on the back of Agatha's middle finger that immediately began to bleed. It wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't something she could hide.</p><p>Rio looked directly at it.</p><p>And then, she was moving.</p><p>Her hand reached down and swiftly grabbed a napkin at the same time she shifted, angling her body a little more toward Agatha's. Her other hand lifted to take hold of Agatha's gingerly. The way Rio tugged at her fingers caused the plastic to drop to the bed, leaving an empty hand that Rio pulled toward her. Carefully, she wrapped the napkin around it and applied a light grip. She had been watching what she was doing but after a moment, her eyes lifted again.</p><p>Agatha's jaw bulged and she swallowed down the overwhelmingly sick feeling that was riding its way up her throat.</p><p>"But you didn't. You figured out what I liked, you ordered it, and you came here and waited for me to get off. And... You brought me a flower because you like me." Rio lowered their hands and scooted a little closer to Agatha in a way that was afforded by the rotated position she had acquired to tend to Agatha's hand.</p><p>"You say it's not something you do, but you still did it. So... Maybe it's more fitting to say it's not something you've done <i>before.</i>"</p><p>Agatha's eyes flickered back and forth across Rio's face as the words were input and tried to process. The first three times, there was an error. Then, it hit her.</p><p>For someone who knew that words were important, Agatha could be a little too cavalier with the things she chose to say. Rio was making that abundantly clear as she stared right into the pits of Agatha's soul.</p><p>There were bells starting to sound in Agatha's head. She was floating away from shore and dangerously close to the riptide that Rio was becoming in her life. Agatha could swim, but with that much force, it was almost guaranteed that she would drown. Fighting her way back didn't even seem to be an option at that point.</p><p>Agatha's blue eyes were stinging even though she knew she wasn't going to cry. She was frustrated, primarily with herself, and she was struggling to find any avenue in which this was okay. Being so far removed from the safety of her throne above the rest of the world because she was too dignified for personal attachments was leaving Agatha feeling like she'd somehow let loose her hold on everything that qualified her as the human being she had come to grow into.</p><p>That was a human who ran when things got uncomfortable.</p><p>That was a human who could drink and laugh with colleagues, but muttered insults under her breath when they parted ways to remind herself she didn't actually need their company.</p><p>That was a human that had known she was leaving Boston in three more years.</p><p>So who was the human that was sitting there letting this beautiful doctor tend to a self-inflicted wound?</p><p>Who was the human that looked into those dark eyes and wanted to shrivel from the intensity she found there?</p><p>Who was the human that <i>knew</i> there was something keeping her there instead of taking off through that door and blocking Rio's number?</p><p>Agatha Harkness had two very conflicting sides of herself in a constant war within her own being and she had absolutely no idea how she was supposed to keep the peace.</p><p>"Agatha?"</p><p>Blue eyes snapped back to Rio, blinking away the storm in her head as quickly as she could.</p><p>"What do you need?"</p><p>Again, eyes were blinking but this time in confusion.</p><p>Rio had spent almost fourteen hours at work that day, had dealt with more than she had anticipating, had to be absolutely exhausted, and there she sat... asking Agatha what she could do for her. In what world was that, in any way, logical?</p><p>Agatha's jaw tightened as teeth clenched and she drew in a slow breath, her gaze meeting Rio's evenly for a moment as she searched for the words.</p><p><i>"I need to know what we're doing here, Rio."</i> Rio started to part her lips, but Agatha was quick to follow up with a qualifier. <i>"And if you give me one of your 'point-out-the-obvious' heinous answers, I swear I will leave."</i></p><p>There was a hint of a smirk on Rio's lips for just a brief moment, but it faded into something warmer, something softer.</p><p>"Well..." Rio began, eyes dropping down to their hands together as she unwound the napkin from Agatha's injured finger. "I cannot speak for you, as I do not know what your motivations are..." Rio leaned back to a point where she was almost laying flat on her back, arm extended so that she could pull open the drawer to her nightstand. She removed something and pushed it shut before she sat back up. As she began to fidget with the paper, Agatha realized it was a band-aid. Her other fingers uncurled and a small tube dropped out of them onto the bed.</p><p>"But what<i> I</i> am doing is taking some time to get to know a beautiful woman who, in all her incoherent glory, called me pretty." Rio was still not looking at her, instead paying full attention as she deftly moved the strip so the paper coverings flipped out and open to reveal the pad in the middle. With her other hand, Rio scooped up the tube and unscrewed the cap with the same hand, letting it fall to the cover on the bed.</p><p>She was so damn skilled, doing something that could be annoying with such utter confidence and ease.</p><p>"What<i> I </i>am doing is subscribing to something for the time being to see if it's something I'd like to put an investment into." She placed a dab of the ointment on the band-aid and set the tube down, both hands raising to hold the opposing ends of the bandage. Her eyes shifted to Agatha's hand that had been pulled back to her lap and reached out with a pinky to hook around one of Agatha's fingers so that she could pull the whole hand closer. Agatha didn't fight her. "What<i> I </i>am doing is choosing to take care of you in spite of realizing that you don't want me to, because I'm hoping that if you understand it's okay to let someone do that, you'll stop trying to leave."</p><p>Carefully, Rio moved so that she could place the treated pad of the bandage to the top of Agatha's middle finger, fastening the rest of it to her skin snugly. Instead of letting Agatha's hand go, Rio pulled it into both of her own and looked Agatha in the eyes again.</p><p>"What I am choosing to do is in my control. The means of getting there might not be, but the intention is. My intention is that you see I'm trying to make an effort. My intention is that you understand that I will never <i>choose</i> to not be there. My intention is to get you to see that you don't have to resign yourself to half-baked work relationships in an attempt to say 'Oh yeah, I have people.' Because we both know those aren't the people you can call when you get hit by a car and have to spend a night in a place no one wants to be."</p><p><i>You have no idea.</i> That thought was so goddamn loud in Agatha's head.</p><p>Rio's grip tightened on Agatha's hand and her eyes were so damn earnest.</p><p>"Most of all, my intention is that you will someday be able to let yourself think of me in those moments and finally let yourself say, 'Yes, I have someone.'" Rio's lips wrought together and Agatha could see that she was actually <i>nervous.</i> Rio was very aware that what she was saying was very likely to cause Agatha to bolt.</p><p>The tension of fear and apprehension was vacant from Agatha's form, however.</p><p>"But... I realize that you have probably already done the mental math of just how much time we've actually spent together. You have probably told yourself that realistically, I don't know a whole lot about you because you've been selective in what you choose to share." Rio hesitated and one of the hands that had been holding onto Agatha's released and slowly lifted, as if asking a silent question.</p><p>Agatha didn't retract.</p><p>Rio's warm palm landed to cup Agatha's jaw gently, thumb brushing softly over the scape of her cheek.</p><p>"You have also probably told yourself that you think I'm going to realize I'm wasting my time. That I'm going to realize I have better things to do. That I'm going to grow bored of you. That I'm going to move on. But... You have to know that if you have, that is all <i>you</i> and none of it is <i>me.</i>"</p><p>This got a reaction. Agatha started to turn her head out of Rio's hold in an indignant rush at being called out like that. Then, it settled. Rio wasn't laying it out for her to make her angry, she was giving Agatha no other choice than to see what she was doing for exactly what it was.</p><p>Rio did not pull her hand away, though. Instead, her thumb moved to brush under Agatha's eye instead.</p><p>"Ultimately, it will always be your choice. You choose whether you stay or go. You choose whether or not you come back if you leave. It's your decision what <i>you</i> want out of this. Do I have a vested personal interest? Of course I do." Rio wanted to move but Agatha could tell by the way she was handling her, like she were a frightened and injured animal, that she was being cautious in not startling her. "But that's because I understand you, even though you think I don't. I don't need to sit here and point out why because that's not a conversation that you're ready to have yet, and I respect that. However... That doesn't mean those things don't influence how I operate."</p><p>Despite the fact that this had turned into a complete monologue, Agatha was sat, completely rapt by every single word that Rio was saying. She could almost feel it, the way her words were sneaking up over the edges of the bed, wrapping around each of Agatha's limbs like thick and strong vines. They were hooking, they were sinking in, and they were tethering her to the moment.</p><p>"I know what it's like to have friends but feel so alone. I know what it's like to lay right here in the silence of the night and wonder what it would be like to have someone next to me. I know what it's like to isolate because it's easier than letting people down. And that's why I can sit here and tell you that you don't have to do that anymore, because I don't want to do it anymore either." Rio paused, taking in a slow breath as her eyes drank in every bit of Agatha's currently neutral expression. "It's only a heavy sentiment if you let it be. It's only so weighted because you're giving it power. If you strip this all down to the barest bones possible, it really is just... Each of us, respectively, not wanting to be so fucking lonely anymore."</p><p>As though she had been pacing a courtroom with confidence in her posture and conviction in every word she said, that last line landed like the bookend to a closing argument that belonged to some high-profile court case.</p><p>Eyes locked again and Agatha could feel every bit of her nerves balled up as they sat directly in the middle of her throat. She knew what Rio's next words were going to be before they left her lips.</p><p>"That's what<i> I</i> am doing. So, Agatha... what are <i>you</i> doing?"</p><p>How did she react to that? What was there to even say? Rio surely knew that she wasn't ready to make such bold declarations of her intentions, so how the hell was she supposed to answer such a weighted question?</p><p>She could feel that ball of nerves as it started to swell and the panic began to seep in.</p><p>There she sat, staring Rio in the eyes knowing that every single thing she had to say had been valid and honest. Rio had very clearly made sure that Agatha knew what went behind each choice she was making. Rio was making it clear to Agatha that Rio's choices were her own, just as Agatha was truly her own maker in all of this.</p><p>What choice would Agatha make with that much knowledge in her hands?</p><p>The silence hung for a few more moments until Agatha finally snapped into decision.</p><p>She did not verbalize an answer.</p><p>Instead, she leaned forward in a way that displaced Rio's hold on her face, but brought Agatha close enough that their lips were suddenly a breath apart. In the same moment, her hands had lifted to cradle Rio's face, to hold her steady. Each pair of eyes were open, boring into the other as the severity of the moment loomed directly over them.</p><p><i>"Right now,"</i> Agatha managed in a dry whisper, <i>"I'm choosing to kiss you. Will you choose to let me?"</i></p><p>Something in Agatha had expected Rio to sag, to feel like she had spent all of that time saying all of those things only for Agatha to be completely dismissive of them, but she didn't.</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, she realized that Agatha was not dismissing her. Maybe she actually understood that with the way she had posed her question, Agatha was making the choice to stay when she felt so incredibly uncomfortable. Agatha was choosing to engage even though Rio had been very pointed in expressing her intentions.</p><p>Agatha was not running.</p><p>That answer in and of itself seemed to be enough for Rio in the moment, and she made it known by answering Agatha's question with a gentle tip of her head, brushing their lips together in something that almost could have been considered a tease.</p><p>Agatha let her. She let Rio do what she wanted for just that moment because even though she couldn't have a conversation about it yet, Agatha had heard every single word she said. She had listened and understood all that Rio had to tell her. She needed to sit with the reality of it for a few days to be able to form a worthy response. So, she would do what she needed to bide her time in the in-between.</p><p><i>"Take off your jacket,"</i> Rio murmured againt her lips, stealing a brief kiss in quiet encouragement. The moment she put the smallest space between them, Agatha was moving and shedding the garment as requested. Rio's eyes swept her again, getting a good look at her in that turtleneck, and a satisfied smile curled her lips.</p><p><i>"Sometimes I swear you don't know how attractive you are,"</i> Rio's low tones voiced as Agatha dropped the suit jacket over the edge of the bed. Agatha did know, but it felt good to hear Rio state as much so plainly.</p><p>Instead of continuing the conversation, Agatha began to move, putting a little more space between them but only to clean up the bed from their meal. She was a little hurried in the manner she tossed everything in the paper sack and dropped it over the edge of the bed. Once the task was completed, she rocked forward onto her knees. Once there, she turned so that she was facing Rio, the flames beginning to lick at those blue irises.</p><p>For the second time in a good ten minutes, Agatha found the ability to speak.</p><p>
<i>"You know <b>exactly</b> how attractive you are, but what you don't know is how attractive you are to me."</i>
</p><p>She leaned forward, supporting herself on balled fists that landed in the plush blanket on either side of Rio's hips. Agatha's long and unkempt hair fell over her shoulder as she lifted her head to meet Rio's face evenly.</p><p>
<i>"Wouldn't it be nice if somehow you could find a way to show me?"</i>
</p><p>And there it was. It was a classic showing of Rio rearing her head to prove to Agatha that her feelings were not hurt, that she was not going to put up a fight and demand that Agatha spill what was going on in her head. It was a white flag that said the conversation could be put to bed for the time being.</p><p>It was also a challenge and Rio had surely realized that Agatha had a hard time backing down from those.</p><p>Agatha leaned toward her, this time letting her eyes flutter shut the second their lips touched. It wasn't a rough kiss, but after just a few seconds, it lost its ability to be called tender. Agatha was kissing Rio like it was the only thing that made sense right then. She was kissing her like it meant something she could never find a way to voice. Agatha was kissing Rio like it was the only way she could respond to everything that had just been said.</p><p>Rio was showing that she was hearing it all loud and clear, especially the moment that the tip of her tongue pressed against Agatha's bottom lip and requested permission to enter. Agatha granted it immediately. She held herself there, letting Rio roam her mouth, taste her teeth, and she offered little fight other than to show her engagement.</p><p>The way Rio's palms had landed flat on either side of her neck felt like a collar, like something meant to hold her in place, but it didn't feel like a restraint. It felt like she was wanted so badly that Rio could not stand the thought of letting her get even an inch away. Between that and the way she was kissing her? Maybe Rio had heard more of Agatha's side of the conversation than had ever hit a single soundwave.</p><p>It was ironic, Agatha thought, that Rio had encouraged her to put on a display and yet, Rio was the one commandeering the situation. She was the one speaking the loudest for those few moments, and Agatha not only was listening, but she started to offer her rebuttal, too.</p><p>Agatha kissed her back a little harder, with a little more fervor, though she was still stationed on all fours and Rio technically still held the majority of the control with the way they were situated. It didn't stop the way that Agatha's tongue pushed back toward enamel that was not her own. It pressed past Rio's lips, this time steering the direction this was taking a little more.</p><p>The atmosphere began to shift the longer they kissed, the hotter it got. Rio's nails were digging into the skin of Agatha's neck by the time Agatha had created enough pressure to encourage her to lay back into the pillows. Still, she complied and Agatha found herself lowering the weight of her body on top of Rio's as her legs shifted to accommodate the way Agatha settled between them.</p><p>She let it go on like that for a few long moments as she tried to shout all of the things she could not voice through her actions, utilizing instead the way she was kissing Rio like her life depended on it.</p><p>Agatha's hands, once free from the necessity of holding her up, were ready to roam. They trekked Rio's sides to the point they reached her hips and wrapped the hem of her t-shirt between her fingers. She lifted herself enough so that Rio could sit up to allow for the removal of the piece of clothing which Agatha was quick and efficient in doing away with. With that shirt removed, she was met with a bare torso that had either been ready for this moment, or for sleep.</p><p>Agatha took little time as she dove right back into Rio's skin.</p><p>Instead of pressing their lips together again, Agatha's face tucked into Rio's neck and lips were making fast work of kissing every inch of it she could get to, even drawing out a soft moan from between Rio's lips as she nipped softly at the lobe of her ear. That was dangerous encouragement.</p><p>Agatha's kisses there became rougher, included more teeth, more pressure as she sucked hard on random patches of skin. It was in the middle of leaving her third hickey that Rio suddenly realized what it was she had been doing.</p><p><i>"Agatha,"</i> she hissed, giving Agatha's side a moderate slap. <i>"If you want to leave hickeys, fuckin' leave them where patients can't see them, maybe?" </i></p><p>Agatha could not help the devious chuckle she breathed against Rio's skin, though she took another chance to sink her teeth in the flesh of Rio's earlobe again. There was a squeal, and then a whimper as her fingertips dug into the spaces between Agatha's ribs on both sides. Per Rio's request, her lips began to travel, to grace spots down her neck, over her throat and down her sternum.</p><p>That was when the feast began. It was intermittent sucking, biting, licking of the flesh from between Rio's collarbones to her navel. In the course of ten entire minutes, she had about six different hickeys between both breasts and her stomach and there were two different bite marks; one was on her left breast toward the inside and the other was just above her hip on the right side.</p><p>She'd let Agatha do it. Each release of flesh brought with it a moan, each sinking of teeth yanking out a yelp of pleasure and releasing it into the night. Agatha was doing what Rio had asked of her, but she was doing it in her own way.</p><p>By the time Agatha was satisfied with her work, she moved onto seeking out more. She had landed in a way that allowed her to easily sink her fingers into the waist of Rio's shorts and underwear, sliding them down her legs with ease so that she could discard them, too. She sat back on her heels and wasted no time in reciprocating the state of undress. As she went to pull the turtleneck off, though, Rio had an opinion to voice.</p><p><i>"Keep the chain,"</i> she requested in a sultry murmur.</p><p>For some insane reason, this made Agatha so hot she nearly started to sweat. She cleared her throat and finished the task of pulling off the sweater. What it revealed was something that caused Rio to smirk in an instant.</p><p>The lace had been a nice touch on their first date, but the see-through mesh of the black bra on her chest clearly looked as sexy to Rio as it made Agatha feel. A smirk found her lips as well, her eyes honed in on Rio's hungry expression.</p><p><i>"Should I keep that too?"</i> Agatha drawled as her hands shifted to slowly creep up her own back.</p><p>Rio seemed to consider it, eyes locked on Agatha's chest. Her tongue swiped at her lips but eventually, she shook her head. Her gaze lifted to meet Agatha's and the statement there was so fucking clear it was almost deafening.</p><p>She wanted Agatha bare.</p><p>So, Agatha gave it to her.</p><p>She quickly worked free the clasp and tossed the bra aside before she shucked the remaining clothing on her lower half.</p><p>Back on her knees, she leaned forward between Rio's bent knees and turned her head to place a soft kiss to the inside of one, and then the other. She chose one to favor in the moment, though, and began to kiss a light trail down the inside of Rio's thigh. Despite knowing where this was going, Agatha had decided that she was not done marking her territory. Teeth sank into flesh again and this time, Rio's hand landed with lightning-quick speed in Agatha's hair, gripping tightly but she did not voice any protest.</p><p>Another kiss, another hickey.</p><p>By the time she had kissed almost as high as she could reach, she had lowered herself to the bed but she had already worked out in her head how this was going to go. Her hands raised and hooked beneath Rio's thighs, right near the transition into her ass, and with some force, she shoved them up, both for her own accessibility and a display of the control she was aching for after that conversation.</p><p>The way she used the position to pull Rio's legs apart only opened her up to Agatha more and as she looked down to the meal in front of her, she knew that this was the <i>one thing</i> she could not completely fuck up about this... relationship? Whatever it was, this was her comfort zone and she was going to use it to her advantage.</p><p>Her head dipped into Rio's open warmth, but the tracing of the tip of her tongue from the base up immediately caused Rio to squirm and whimper, her fingers actually shifting to pull at Agatha's hair. Agatha did it again, Rio's protest growing louder in the way she moaned Agatha's name.</p><p>Agatha pushed a little harder at Rio's thighs, forcing her knees slightly closer to her chest but also accomplishing what she wanted in giving her the slightest bit more surface area to work with as she opened up that much more.</p><p>With that, Agatha clocked in.</p><p>She was hungry, damn near starved for the satisfaction that she could find right there with her face buried between Rio's legs, tasting every bit of her that she could reach with her lips and tongue. She wasn't rushing by any means, but her starvation had to be apparent.</p><p>The more Rio twisted and yanked at her hair, the more Agatha wanted it. The more Rio moaned and gasped, the more worked up Agatha became.</p><p>Agatha could feel the pit in her own stomach building and although she did not desist in the slightest in the attention she was paying to Rio's body, her own was screaming for the same.</p><p>One of her hands unhooked from Rio's left thigh and Agatha adjusted her own body, hips lifting slightly as her knees shifted barely to support the move. This caused the unsupported leg of Rio's to drop, heel resting on Agatha's back. The moment Agatha was comfortable, her hand sank down her own body and her fingers graced her sex in a way that caused her to moan against the wetness of Rio's core at her mouth.</p><p>Despite that she was locked into the throes of her own pleasure, Rio suddenly realized what Agatha was doing and pulled her hair even harder as if to encourage her to stop but it did the exact opposite and she moaned again.</p><p>If Rio would knock that off, she could do both at the same time.</p><p>The longer her tongue worked and the more Rio kept gripping at her hair like that, she could feel both in Rio's body and her own that they were almost there.</p><p>Her lips pursed over Rio's clit, tongue working with deft precision against it as the fingers of her hand curled into her own body. Her hips shifted into her own palm and she let out a low hum of satisfaction, one that apparently stamped Rio's hot button with ferocity.</p><p>Rio's hand immediately flattened and slid around the back of Agatha's head, forcing it down as she cried out, a long and low moan following the initial sound of shock.</p><p>In that same moment, Rio's metaphorical hand slammed down on that button for Agatha, too. She'd curled her fingers inside of herself and with one swipe of her thumb over her clit, Agatha too came completely unglued. A loud moan rumbled out of her against Rio's body that only seemed to cause her to tighten up, fingers starting to grip at Agatha again, but she caught herself and released.</p><p>Agatha lifted her head as Rio's trembling began to quell and for just a moment, she enjoyed the sight.</p><p>The hand that had been on Agatha's head had slid down, falling off to rest along the haunch of her hip and the other hand was smoothing her hair back as her chest rose and fell in rapid succession as a byproduct of Agatha's effort.</p><p>The look on Rio's face was what struck Agatha somewhere in the middle of the chest.</p><p>She looked... peaceful. Serene, even.</p><p>Rio looked like she had gotten the answer to the question she had asked and for now, it seemed to be good enough.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Although Agatha had not done much to exert herself, there was something that appeared to be calming enough about Rio's presence that she had felt quite tired as Rio quietly encouraged her to lay down next to her. The knee-jerk reaction had been to insist she could go, but then she snapped back to that conversation, to those ten minutes where Rio absolutely spread it all out very clearly and very cleanly in front of Agatha.</p><p>Agatha, who had thought that if she ever engaged with someone who wanted more, that made them clingy. She'd formed all of these high-and-mighty opinions of women she had no intent for other than a quick fuck and maybe a round two, if she'd been feeling generous.</p><p>And now, there she was as she moved to lay on her front on that bed in that three story condo right next to Rio.</p><p>Doctor Rio. Funny Rio. No-nonsense Rio. Beautiful Rio. Thoughtful Rio. Kind Rio. Enigmatic Rio.</p><p>As Agatha laid there with her cheek pressed to the pillow and her arm tucked under it, she couldn't help but just... gaze at the woman next to her in every bit of her marked up and bare glory. Rio was probably going to be pretty pissed when she got a look at her own neck in the mirror, but that was something Agatha was willing to bet she would forgive.</p><p>It might take a lot of foundation, but it could be covered with enough effort. As well as the one that was on the other side, hopefully. She wasn't as worried about the half of one she'd been working on when Rio had stopped her.</p><p>The more Agatha's eyes wandered, the more accomplished she felt in this strange way she knew she would have a hard time trying to explain if someone asked her about it. Seeing that clear impression her teeth had left on Rio's far breast made a sense of pride well in her chest. She'd done that, she had left that brand on Rio.</p><p>It wasn't even that Agatha was marking that territory for anyone else to see, even if her assault on Rio's neck <i>might</i> have started to lean in that direction. No, that had been for Agatha as much as it had been for Rio.</p><p>It was a doubled edged sword in that way.</p><p>For Agatha, it was a visual that could remind her what she had if she'd let herself take it. It was something to behold that told her that there was a woman right there who was willing to endure a little pain in only the way one might if they were be showered with the kind of attention Agatha had paid to Rio the night before.</p><p>For Rio, it was a visible promise. Agatha was making a statement with that kind of hunger, that kind of desire. Agatha was doing her own groundwork in laying out all of the things she couldn't put into words.</p><p>Agatha knew how to use words like they were weapons. She knew how to point them, how to hurl and sling them with malicious intent. She also knew how to use them as an amplifier. She could be articulate in times that called for it... Most of the time.</p><p>In a way, perhaps her roughness with Rio's body had been anchored in a little bit of her indignation at being completely stunned to silence. That wasn't something that happened to Agatha with frequency.</p><p>Then again, what that she had experienced since meeting Rio was something she'd ever let happen to her before?</p><p>The moment that she felt Rio shift on the bed, she almost questioned it but instead, her eyes opened to see for herself. Rio picked herself up slightly and leaned forward, leaning over Agatha's back to place a kiss on her far shoulder blade. Rio's hand had landed on the small of Agatha's back but it did not take time for it to start roaming.</p><p>Agatha's eyes slid shut again at how good it felt to just be touched, to be caressed. She'd let herself sink deep into the delight of it that she had not been able to keep hold of the soft <i>Hmmm</i> that rumbled between pressed lips. It hadn't been loud and had been muffled by her ability to keep her mouth shut, but it had been low and thick with want.</p><p>Rio's hand simply rubbed and kneaded and gripped at Agatha's ass cheek, something she had noted that Rio quite liked about her body. The more she kissed little lines across Agatha's shoulder, the more the calm seemed to wash in over her. Rio's hand didn't jump to the other side of her body but instead dropped down the back of her thigh, continuing that same press and pull with those skilled fingers.</p><p>Those fingers that had been so nimble in tending to the wound Agatha had caused herself in her own anxiety.</p><p>Agatha could feel every bit of tension as it began to ebb out of her body the longer Rio paid attention to it. She could feel every single place where Rio worked the knots right out of her muscles. It was like she knew what she was doing, like she was fully aware of both the right spots to press and also what it would do to Agatha to have someone focus on her for once in her life.</p><p>After another long few minutes, Rio's fingertips began to graze up the inside of Agatha's thigh, but Agatha was quick to offer soft protest.</p><p><i>"No, no,"</i> was all she could manage, the whisper quiet but noticeably a little tight.</p><p>Rio's lips lifted from Agatha's skin uncertainly, her brow pinching a little. The silence thickened for a moment, but then Agatha realized that Rio was waiting on an explanation.</p><p>
<i>"I'm okay. I got mine. But... I do like what you were doing before."</i>
</p><p>That was something Rio heard clear as day like a pin dropping in an empty room. Agatha had laid down, however begrudging she had made her disposition seem. That was certainly a choice. But to hear her state so plainly something she wanted? It was progress and honestly, Rio felt strangely proud of her for having moved forward even that much.</p><p>In answer, Rio shifted and swung one leg over Agatha's body and then the other so that she could place herself in a position that was a mirror image of the one she'd maintained originally on the other side of that river of skin.</p><p>Rio's hand dropped much in the same way the other had done and she repeated the same process, kisses on the right shoulder this time, over the course of the next fifteen minutes. Somewhere around minute twelve, Agatha had fallen asleep.</p><p>She slept soundly as Rio had hovered over her, as she had reached forward and pulled some of that wild hair back from her face. She had even snored as Rio took just a couple of moments to revere her, to appreciate her. She had even slept right through the soft kiss Rio pressed to her cheek after she climbed over her to her spot on the bed.</p><p>In fact, when Agatha woke up the next morning and she took a deep breath, she knew exactly where she was before she opened her eyes. When she did, though, she was met with disappointment at the sight of an empty bed in front of her. Immediately, almost expecting it, Agatha's head lifted and eyes fell to the desk in the corner of the room and more disappointment washed over her.</p><p>Rio wasn't there, either.</p><p>A soft but annoyed sigh passed through Agatha's lips as she pushed herself to a sitting position so that she could swing her legs over the bed. She glanced down at the floor, looking at her clothes in their various locations but she wasn't ready to get dressed yet. She did pull on her underwear but then made her way over to Rio's closet, very brazenly thumbing through until she found a black hoodie.</p><p>Agatha pulled it out and looked down at the front of it, grinning at what she saw.</p><p>It was a cartoon cat with headphones on and encircled around it were the words: 'MAGNOLIA THUNDERPUSSY RECORDS. COLUMBUS, OHIO.'</p><p>It was actually kind of... cute. Very... Rio.</p><p>Agatha pulled it over her head, feeling like she had a little bit of armor as she ventured on her hunt to find Rio. While she was on the third floor, she checked the other rooms -- an office, a spare bedroom, and an empty room with a couple of boxes inside -- but there was no Rio.</p><p>Moving down to the second floor, the first place Agatha checked was the greenhouse but it, too was empty. She checked every room, only a little surprised that she had not found a single locked door, even as she popped her head in other rooms on the first floor.</p><p>She was also pretty annoyed by the time she closed the last door that had housed a home gym. What <i>didn't </i>Rio have in this house?</p><p>The one thing Rio <i>should</i> have had in the house was nowhere to be found.</p><p>
<i>Rio herself.</i>
</p><p>Had she left for work already? Had she just decided that it wasn't worth waking Agatha up to say goodbye?</p><p>As her breath caught in her throat, Agatha's brow pinched in frustration.</p><p>No... It couldn't be.</p><p>Agatha's feelings were... <i>hurt?</i></p><p>She let out an angry grunt at the thought and stomped her way right back toward those stairs, her grip tight on the banister as she began to march back up to the third floor so that she could put that stupid suit back on and go home. She hit the fourth step and a sound pulled at her attention.</p><p>It was the sound of the front door opening as Rio bustled through it with a few blown flakes of snow that were caught in the gusts of the winter day outside. In her hand, she was holding a cardboard cup holder with three cups inside of it, two of which had the tag of a tea bag hanging from them. In the same hand, dangling from her fingers was a bag with the logo "Black Sheep Bagel Co" printed on the side of it.</p><p>Rio hadn't left without saying goodbye.</p><p>She'd gone to get breakfast in the hope that she could be back before Agatha woke up. Obviously it hadn't worked and it showed by the shock on her face as she saw Agatha's back on the stairs, her head turned over her shoulders.</p><p>"I thought you'd still be asleep," Rio offered as she set her things down on the table in the foyer so that she could shed her layers, leaving her in a pair of joggers and a sweatshirt that had a large block 'O' in scarlet stitching and a small buckeye in the corner.</p><p>Agatha could feel herself melt a little. Rio was wearing something she'd surely procured from the university when she was med school. And Agatha --</p><p>"What are you wearing?" Rio questioned with a soft laugh at the sight of Agatha's ass cheeks visible just beneath the hem of whatever shirt she had on. As Agatha turned on the steps to slowly make her way down them, there was a blooming of something more beautiful than any flower that she had forgotten to clip for her hair that morning as it began to paint itself across Rio's face. Even her eyes softened and her head tilted just slightly to the side.</p><p>"And what made you pick that?" Rio posed, reaching over for the bag and cup holder.</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p>"It was the first thing I grabbed. But when I looked at it, I liked it, I guess."</p><p>"Well," Rio offered with an indicative tip of her head, "it looks really good on you."</p><p>There was this strange feeling, this heat that seemed to pool near the apple of Agatha's cheeks and she felt a spike of anxiety slam right through her.</p><p>
<i>Agatha was blushing.</i>
</p><p>Rio pretended not to notice, but she did.</p><p>"I got bagels. As appreciative as I am of how adventurous you were last night, I got you lox and cream cheese on an everything. I also got an Asiago bagel with schmear on the side in case you didn't want the lox." Agatha was watching her, trying not to smile at what she was seeing.</p><p>This was the first time Agatha had seen Rio's nerves quake. Last night's show of them had been expected given the content of what had been said, but this time?</p><p>It was adorable.</p><p>Agatha's eyes dropped to the three cups and then swept back up to land in Rio's dark gaze.</p><p>"Did you invite someone over?" Agatha prodded, already aware that they were not expecting company. Very obviously, Rio had done the same thing with the teas that she had with the bagels. She had gone with her gut, but she had been more than willing to provide an alternative.</p><p>"One is green with honey and the other is earl grey. I have almond milk in the fridge if you wanted any, but I'm not sure how well it would go with tea."</p><p>"Rio..." Agatha soothed, trying to slow her down. Agatha stepped forward and pulled the drink holder out of Rio's hand, securing it in her own. "I like early grey and green, but prefer earl grey in the morning. So... You did good." She punctuated her statement with the warmest curling of her lips she'd been able to muster thus far.</p><p>At the lack of mention of the bagels, though, Rio's face fell slightly but enough that Agatha noticed it.</p><p>"And I love lox."</p><p>In a move that startled even her, Agatha leaned forward and quickly pressed a soft kiss to Rio's cheek that was over before it began.</p><p>"Thank you, Rio. This was very sweet of you."</p><p>"Yeah, well. Don't get used to it."</p><p>Ah, yes! There she was. There was Classic Rio. She'd wavered there for a moment that had caused Agatha to feel slightly wary but it seemed that she had snapped right back into her old, cocky and confident self.</p><p>"Let's eat. I still have to shower and get ready for work when we're done, but you're welcome to stay until I have to leave." Her voice was smooth, but Agatha could hear that she was being sincere.</p><p>Agatha followed her to the table and sat, pulling the tea she wanted out of the holder, as well as Rio's coffee that she sat down on the other side of the table.</p><p>Rio had set about doling out their food and as they ate, they held light conversation about Rio's work schedule and had decided that they would try for another meal together. Rio had started listing off places they could go, but Agatha hadn't really been listening. Instead, she interrupted Rio mid-suggestion.</p><p>"What if I just came over here?" Agatha asked, blue eyes snapping up to read the immediate surprise that wrote itself across Rio's face.</p><p>"I can pick something up, make you something nice to come home to. That way, if it's a bad day you don't have to worry about taking the time and energy to get ready for a night out." Agatha was a little shocked by the sound of her own voice as she made the suggestion.</p><p>"You want to do that?" Rio asked, actively fighting to keep the interrogation out of her tone.</p><p>Agatha met her evenly across the table and gave a single nod of her head.</p><p>"I would rather choose to make things easier on you than add to your guilt if something happens to come up again."</p><p>Rio's lips both pressed and curled at the same time in a tight smile that told Agatha that she had done something right, that she had touched a tender spot that Rio had been aching for someone to pay attention to.</p><p>"Monday night, you said you're off at 8?"</p><p>Rio nodded her response so Agatha kept going.</p><p>"Do you have a hide-a-key?"</p><p>Again, Rio nodded.</p><p>"It's underneath the painted flowerpot. But Agatha..." Rio was trying to find reasons why Agatha might not actually want to do this, but Agatha was being very clear with her own intent.</p><p>"For this time only, I'm going to be the annoyingly persistent one. I will be here when you get off with some form of alcohol and something delicious to eat. Do you think you can handle that?"</p><p>Rio's postured sagged slightly, but the look on her face was... tender.</p><p>"I think I can handle that."</p><p>They had finished their breakfast and set about preparing to leave, Rio having hopped in the shower and Agatha having redressed herself and placed herself in the same spot at the end of that bed as she'd posted up in earlier that week to wait the couple of minutes for Rio to finish her routine and appear.</p><p>When she did, her glare had been pointed and Agatha could clearly see the two spots on her neck that were slightly the wrong color. The sight caused an absolute shit-eating grin to spread her lips.</p><p>They continued Rio's routine when she made her stop in the greenhouse and returned with a natal lily clipped in her hair.</p><p>Agatha truly was astounded by what a riddle Rio was. What she realized with her next thought was that she liked trying to figure her out.</p><p>They had followed the playbook almost step for step the way they had the last time they had done this dance, but this time when Rio leaned in, it wasn't Agatha's cheek she kissed.</p><p>What was even more shocking was that as she went to pull away, Agatha made a quick grab for her coat and kissed her again.</p><p>They separated and tucked into their respective cars, leaving Agatha with enough time to get home, shower, and make it to her 1:30 lecture that day. Thankfully, it was the only one she had.</p><p>The weekend had been agonizingly slow. She'd tried to keep conversation with Rio during her shift but it was pretty sporadic with how busy she tended to be. It wasn't something Agatha held against her in the least, but it <i>was</i> something she wished could be different.</p><p>She also had not exactly desisted with the occasional lewd photo, though she wasn't as persistent about it as she had initially been those first few days.</p><p>She still had yet to receive a reply that matched the energy, but she still held out hope each time she got a response. Instead of a photo, it was always some jamming of letters or some underhanded comment about what an asshole Agatha was.</p><p>By the time Monday morning rolled around Agatha had devised a plan. She had a morning and afternoon lecture that day, but she would be leaving the office at 4pm sharp. She would go to the market, she would pick up the things to put together a charcuterie board, would grab a couple of bottles of wine and head to Rio's with everything in tow.</p><p>So, that was exactly what she had done. She had even needed to stop back by her own home so she could get the resin and cherry board she'd gotten as a Christmas gift the year before from one of her coworkers. She didn't use it much, but she couldn't have found a better excuse to break it in.</p><p>Her arms and hands were completely full with everything she had brought with her for their night in and she was only able to get to the key by setting a couple of the bags down first. Once inside, she checked the time to see that she had about forty minutes until the time Rio had said she should be coming home.</p><p>So Agatha had set to work and only remembered as she pulled out the prosciutto that it wasn't really going to be needed. She did not know the extent of Rio's allergy so it was best not to press it. She'd tossed it inside the refrigerator with the salami she'd purchased as well, both still sealed. She turned back to the items in front of her and set to work.</p><p>She baked the brie, sliced the gouda and aged white cheddar. She found small ramekins to put the olives in, as well as one for a cucumber dip. There were slices of mozzarella layered with tomatoes and fresh basil drizzled with balsamic. A variety of nuts from cashews to almonds were clustered in small spaces, surrounded by both red and green grapes and scatterings of various berries.</p><p>With a little more finesse, Agatha was satisfied with her work. She lifted the board and carried it out into the living room, placing it on the coffee table before she went to fetch one bottle of wine and when she did not find wine glasses anywhere in Rio's cabinets, she pulled two mugs down instead and carried them over to the table to sit with the food. With one more trip, she had grabbed the crackers as well and got them out and ready.</p><p>She checked her watch and when she saw the time, something in her middle sank with the weight of a stone.</p><p>It had taken her a little longer than she had expected to prepare everything. And Rio was already ten minutes late.</p><p>Agatha searched briefly before she was able to locate the remote to turn on the television across from the couch. She flipped through channels but nothing was grabbing her attention. She glanced down at the remote and hit the button that bore the Netflix logo.</p><p>There was only one profile and it just said 'Me.'</p><p>This tickled Agatha for just a moment. It was such a Rio thing to do.</p><p>Instead of immediately looking for something to watch, Agatha decided to scroll through Rio's 'currently watching' and her list. She had a few interesting choices but nothing that Agatha would have judged her for.</p><p>She landed on Madam Secretary for the sole fact that if she was going to sit there and wait, she could do it while watching a fox like Tea Leoni.</p><p>After thirty minutes with no text, Agatha had stared long and hard at that bottle of wine, almost swearing she could hear it daring her to pop the cork. No. She was going to wait for Rio.</p><p>And she tried. She really did try. She had checked her phone a little before nine, but it was the last time she did it before she curled up on that couch and drifted off to sleep.</p><p>She was not sure how long she had been out, but she woke up to someone handling her legs. Blue eyes flew open as she struggled to place her setting, but as they swept up, she saw Rio moving her a bit to try and get her up.</p><p>"Oh, good. You're awake. I thought I was going to have to carry you upstairs." Rio's voice was soft, but it also sounded tired.</p><p><i>"Mmm, what time is it?"</i> Agatha asked, voice hoarse and groggy.</p><p>"It's almost eleven. I texted at nine-thirty, but I think you'd already fallen asleep. I'm really sorry." Even though this was becoming a pattern, Agatha didn't find herself to be upset about it. "Let's go upstairs."</p><p>In her half-asleep mind, Agatha misunderstood.</p><p>"But I made you this fruit and cheese board... But the brie is probably solid again," she managed, a little pour protruding on her lips.</p><p>Rio reached down and easily grabbed hold of the board, tilting her head toward the stairs.</p><p>"We can eat in bed. Seems to be our thing, hm?" Rio posed sweetly.</p><p>Even if she wanted to, Agatha was too tired to argue. Instead, she rose to her feet and reached down to grab the mugs and the bottle of wine. Her head lifted to see Rio depart, heading straight for and up those stairs.</p><p>"Hey!" Agatha called after her, bustling over to the stairs with her full hands.</p><p>"Who the fuck has a greenhouse in their house but doesn't own wine glasses?"</p>

<p>There had been an odd feeling that had wound through the atmosphere as Agatha had found herself next to Rio in that bed, Agatha half laid back and Rio tentatively picking at the variety of fruit and nuts on the board Agatha had worked to prepare for them.</p><p>It had felt like peace, almost, at first. As the night wore on, though, Agatha started to face the slightly terrifying and slightly aggravating reality of what it actually was.</p><p>
<i>This was domesticity.</i>
</p><p>The mere thought made her feel like she might actually be sick. Upon further inspection... Well, it wasn't exactly false. This was turning into a pattern. Agatha would show up for Rio, Rio would be late and Agatha would forgive her because she understood why. Agatha had known that what Rio did for a living, the cause she dedicated herself so wholly to, would put space between them temporarily. She had a duty to her profession and Agatha could respect that, far more than she was actually able to voice appropriately, which said a lot.</p><p>They had picked at that board and Rio had loosely detailed why she had ended up being so late, which had included an instance of trauma that Rio had felt ill over.</p><p>It really struck Agatha in that moment that while she had a vast understanding of what Rio did, Agatha was seeing for herself what that kind of thing did to someone. Rio could still carry that air of confidence, she could wear that smile and say that everything would be okay, but of all the people in the world, she knew how empty that promise could be if made at the wrong time.</p><p>For the first time, she was seeing what that push and pull was doing to Rio. Even more than that, she could see the way it was affecting her even more now that she had something she <i>wanted</i> to devote her time to outside of her job.</p><p>Agatha had just listened, just let Rio vaguely vent about some of the darker corners of her job that people rarely took into consideration.</p><p>It was having to walk away from sobbing family members. It was holding the hand of someone until the spark of life disappeared from their muscles. It was being the one positive thing people in distress might be able to hold onto.</p><p>That, Agatha had reminded her, was an aspect of it that she was not only familiar with, but thankful for too.</p><p>It was at that point that Rio had kissed her. It wasn't even just a kiss, really. It was a brushing of their lips, yes, but there was more there. There was a gentle sense of gratitude, something that clearly communicated that Rio had needed Agatha being there more than she would have willingly let onto.</p><p>That was a startling feeling, but Agatha realized that she didn't tense up when she let herself feel it. She understood it, and she knew that she was the one putting in the effort. Seeing it and feeling as it was recognized had been an unintended side effect, but Agatha was dealing with the symptoms as they came.</p><p>Agatha had offered to put what had gone uneaten away and Rio had agreed that it would be a good idea. The kiss Rio had given her as she had climbed out of the bed had communicated to Agatha not only the appreciation, but also held a promise in it as well, one that flickered with heat at the way Rio had nibbled on Agatha's bottom lip.</p><p>It had taken Agatha roughly fifteen minutes to get everything wrapped up and put away. She'd grabbed them each a bottle of water and, with a small sense of desire beginning to pull at the threads of her being, she took the stairs back up to an awaiting Rio.</p><p>Well, what should have been an awaiting Rio.</p><p>What Agatha found as she stepped into that doorway was a Rio who was still half-upright, but her head was tilted all the way back with the top of it pressed to the fabric of the headboard. Her mouth was wide open because of the angle and she was dead asleep.</p><p>For just a moment, Agatha felt her form slacken as she leaned against the doorway to Rio's bedroom and just... took it all in.</p><p>She took in the desk in the corner with its mess of papers and the several pencils that laid atop it. She took in the modest television that was hung on the wall and considered how it was likely there more for show than anything else. She took in the dresser with the couple of photo frames atop it, ones that held memories of Rio and her friends.</p><p>She took in the decorative mug Rio had ended up with on her nightstand and had to laugh to herself at the absurdity of it. Rio was a grown woman who had all of these insane and incredible details to who she was as a person and yet, she drank almost anything she had out of a mug. Agatha had not missed the lack of other cups, too, but she hadn't felt it pertinent enough for a call out.</p><p>Then, she took in Rio.</p><p>She looked so spent, so exhausted in a way that only she could feel.</p><p>Agatha appreciated the commitment that Rio had made and kept to her career. Anyone else might have felt slighted at the way Rio could commit her time to little else, but because of what Agatha had experienced in her own life, she was able to just... <i>get it.</i> She was able to offer some twisted form of empathy when it came to knowing why Rio did the things she did.</p><p>Though she was done making such an unwitnessed display of it, Agatha still carried the reverence she had developed in those moments with her as she made the active choice to step forward into the bedroom. Then, Agatha made the very active choice to take off her pants and finagle the removal of her bra without taking her shirt off.</p><p>Lastly, Agatha made the incredibly conscious and only slightly tipsy choice to kneel onto the bed, carefully and gently stirring Rio enough to convince her to lay down a little more. She continued with that choice as she laid down next to Rio after reaching over her to turn the light off.</p><p>She did not make any move to cuddle, did not initiate any contact outside of the way the side of her arm pressed to the side of Rio's as they laid there on their backs. Rio's breathing was slow and even to a point where Agatha knew she had slipped right back into slumber, and even as Agatha's eyes had bored a hole into the ceiling, they eventually grew heavy, too.</p><p>When Agatha had woken up some time in the middle of the early morning, the room still dark, she could feel every single spot where Rio had rolled to her side and placed her head on Agatha's chest. She could feel <i>so</i> acutely the half-formed embrace of Rio's arm over her stomach.</p><p>Strangely enough, it took her all of three minutes to go back to sleep, still situated just like that.</p><p>The next morning, they had followed that same routine of Rio showering and getting ready for work. This time, though, Rio had pulled Agatha in with her when she went to make her morning flower selection and left the choice up to Agatha.</p><p>Something sentimental in the back of Agatha's mind had known what she was going to choose even as she took the time to look over the variety of other flowers contained in that room. They each had their own little biomes, their little domains where they could each reach their full potential.</p><p>The soft <i>How did I know? </i>was unmissable from behind her as Agatha stopped in front of the snapdragons, her fingers brushing over the petals of one as her lips curled in a smile she was almost thankful Rio could not see.</p><p>After bundling up, it did not take them stepping outside for Rio to take hold of the lapels of Agatha's coat to kiss her. It wasn't just a kiss of parting. It wasn't just a kiss of saying 'see you later.'</p><p>The way Rio kissed Agatha told Agatha everything that Rio wanted to say about the fact that Agatha had spent the night without the promise of physical release. It said, in volumes, that she was thankful for that <i>very specific</i> choice.</p><p>And Agatha had let her. She let Rio kiss her like that because it was the first time in Agatha's life that she had let <i>anyone </i>kiss her like that. It felt so very fitting in the moment that Rio was the one doing it.</p><p>The departed to their cars and no sooner had Agatha's own departed the curb than her phone was buzzing in her chest pocket. She reached in and fished it out, opening to see the message that had been awaiting her:</p><p>
<i>"Even when it's grey outside, waking up next to you somehow feels like seeing the light of day."</i>
</p><p>Agatha's throat tightened just for a moment, but then she let the knowing settle into her. Rio could have said that to her face and she probably would have seen the terror that came along with the way Agatha's throat had bobbed.</p><p>But Rio knew that. She knew that a verbal admission of such magnitude would have startled Agatha. So, she said it when Agatha was quiet, when she was alone, when she didn't have to put up a front. It had taken Agatha a couple of minutes to deal with her own personal turmoil at the feeling of being appreciated like that before she was able to type a response.</p><p>
<i>"Who's the poet now?"</i>
</p><p>The twisting of her lips that happened in the back of the car was somehow both a smirk and a smile, one that was both warm and mischievous. Rio's response came quick.</p><p>
<i>"I'm still not sure you are one...(:"</i>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and stowed her phone for the rest of the ride back to her townhome, feeling as though Rio may never actually stop trying to get under her skin, even when she was already there.</p><p>They had managed to keep a somewhat consistent conversation throughout the week, but Agatha had not found it important to mention that as she walked out of her office on Wednesday evening, she did not have to return for the next couple of weeks due to the holiday break. She knew she probably should have, that it would have given Rio some peace to know there was more of Agatha's time available to her if she wanted it. But, Agatha was letting Rio exist in the weight of her own world before adding onto it.</p><p>Saturday morning, she had woken up to a text from Rio that was a little more than she'd ever really said in a text message before.</p><p>
<i>"Hey, I don't know how often you keep an eye on the weather, but I came in early today because it's supposed to get nasty out the later it gets. If you can order/go get groceries as early as you can, it would probably be a good idea in case you get stuck. Just some friendly advice. And if it does get as bad as they're predicting, please, Agatha, stay safe and stay warm."</i>
</p><p>In a move that felt so out of place, Agatha buried her face a little more in the pillow before she brought herself to read the message again. And again. And a third additional time for good measure.</p><p>Rio was so sweet. She really did care and it showed in the smaller actions and choices like that one. Rio knew that the plans they'd loosely established were probably out the window if they were going to get the accumulation that would be predicted. She knew that and still thought to make it a point to insist that Agatha take care of herself.</p><p>
<i>"I went last night, so I'm pretty stocked. Please be careful when you leave. Let me know when you get home safely."</i>
</p><p>What Agatha did not disclose was that she had also purchased a bottle of bourbon that was a little pricey for the next time she did get to go back to Rio's.</p><p>That was a thought.</p><p>For the duration that they had been immersing themselves in this emotional tennis match, Rio had never come to Agatha's home. That had been intentional on Agatha's part; what little pieces of the real her that were still left solely existed within those walls. It was something that was going to take time, something Agatha had to really dismantle herself on before she let that happen.</p><p>Or so she'd thought.</p><p>The conversation the two of them had been able to keep up was almost non-existent. The longer the day wore on, the more Agatha watched outside of her window as the snow started to pile and the less she checked her phone to see if Rio had sent her a message.</p><p>As it grew dark, Agatha had decided on a hot shower. Once out, she stared down at her phone on the sink, void of any incoming declaration that Rio was safely at home. Slender fingers slid the phone into her palm and she unlocked the camera. This time, though, her face was in it with her wet hair and tired eyes, and the frame dropped to mid sternum.</p><p>She managed a smile and snapped the picture, bringing the phone down to type a message.</p><p>
<i>"Just thinking about you out in the cold. Wish I could be waiting to warm you up."</i>
</p><p>Before she could spend any second of time dwelling on the emotional responsibility she was taking on by sending it, she pressed the little paper plane in the corner and put her phone back down as she tended to dressing herself.</p><p>Normally, a robe was common dress for Agatha when she was home alone and the sun had gone down, but with it being as cold as it was outside, it had begun to seep into the house in various spots. As a result, she had pulled on a pair of leggings and shoved her arms and head through the holes of a thick fleece hoodie that she never would have stepped outside wearing.</p><p>To busy herself, she cleaned up the desk that was in the front room, placing the various books that had been opened or left out in their spaces on the shelf. The last one she slid in was her personal notebook, though it was bound in a similar fashion as the other compositions she owned. The remaining book on the corner of the desk as she turned back was the same one that Rio had bought her those couple of weeks ago.</p><p>Just seeing it, Agatha couldn't help but smile. She'd gotten a little ways through it and upon seeing it, she realized she was going to leave it out as cannon fodder for the next couple of days where she was surely going to be trapped to the confines of her home. Heading back toward the desk to move it over, she was stopped mid-way by the sound of her phone ringing.</p><p>It took her the blink of an eye to launch across that room and pull it into her hand. At the same time she saw Rio was calling, she noted that it was also nine at night.</p><p>"Hey, everything okay?" Agatha pressed the moment she lifted the phone to her ear. She could hear a great deal of noise in the background on Rio's end, but Agatha couldn't place where she might be.</p><p>"No," Rio answered and the one word was so stressed and so panicked that Agatha could feel every place in her chest that tightened at the sound. "I have no idea how I'm going to get home and I cannot stay at the hospital. I just... I'm..."</p><p>"Hey, hey," Agatha tried to soothe as she paced over to the window, watching the shimmering white in the light of the streetlamps. "Are you walking now?"</p><p>"I'm trying!" Rio insisted back shrilly, but Agatha could tell it was out of nothing more than sheer stress.</p><p>"Rio, listen to me. I know that Avon Hill is still a ways to go, but if you can find someone that can get you here, you can just stay with me. It's easier than trying to get all the way to East Watertown in all of this shit," Agatha offered softly, trying to keep her tone controlled and even because she sensed that it was something Rio desperately needed in her state of duress.</p><p>"Agatha, I'll be fine," Rio tried to dismiss and Agatha immediately understood that she was only doing it because she was already upset about the state of the weather outside and how it was impacting her ability to simply get home and rest after what was surely an insane day at work.</p><p>"Rio, this isn't a debate. Bribe a plow driver if you have to, but please turn up at the address I'm about to send you. I have plenty of food, a plethora of blankets, and maybe I have a bottle of bourbon here that has your name on it."</p><p>For once, Rio did not have an immediate response. She was quiet on the other end of that line, so Agatha filled the silence.</p><p>"I just sent it to you. Just... try to get here, okay? We can worry about the rest of it later."</p><p>A soft sigh sounded and Agatha could hear the resignation as it bubbled out of Rio.</p><p>"Okay. I'll see you... as soon as I can, I guess."</p><p>"Okay, Rio. Please be careful."</p><p>"I will. Bye, Agatha."</p><p>With that, the line was dead and her own phone signified that the call had ended. She could have spent however long it might take Rio to get there trying to psychoanalyze every reason Rio had tried to be resistant to the idea that Agatha was offering her somewhere safe to go, but instead she busied herself by lighting a fire in the stone fireplace that was centered on the wall in the living room.</p><p>It wasn't something she did often; chimney upkeep was an absolute bitch, but she would also just burrow under layers of blankets in bed if it was going to be her alone riding out the storm.</p><p>For the first time since living in Reykjavik, Agatha was willingly putting herself in a position where she would be spending an indefinite amount of time with someone. While that should have had certain connotations that should have excited her, she couldn't find the ability to locate glee just yet. No, she was too concerned with Rio's safety in the forty minutes it took her to get there.</p><p>Agatha had been watching intently as the world outside moved by that window. The snow got slowly higher and the frequency with which people and cars were slowly passing by seemed to decline. She hardly moved from that spot, at least not until she saw a plow start to pass by, but then it slowed. After another second, it came to a stop. The driver looked toward the right to his passenger's side and gave a nod of his head.</p><p>Another beat and there she was, shuffling around the front of the plow in her big coat with its fur lined hood and teal scrub legs.</p><p>She did that.</p><p>Agatha hadn't exactly been serious in the suggestion, but...</p><p>
<i>Rio had fucking done that.</i>
</p><p>In a rush, Agatha made a push for her front door, trying to fight the urge to completely yank it open and drag Rio in from the cold. The haste was still there was she opened it, but she tried as hard as she could to make herself look a little less desperate for the relief she'd found in being able to see with her own eyes that Rio had made it and was safe.</p><p>Carefully, Rio climbed the snow-covered stairs and Agatha stepped back a little more so that she could provide the space for her to come inside.</p><p>As she crossed into the home and Agatha shut the door, Agatha had not been expecting the rush of unidentifiable emotion that smacked into her the moment she turned to look at Rio.</p><p>Rio, with her pink nose and cheeks from the bite of the cold. Rio, with melting snowflakes in the part of her hair that escaped the confines of her hat. Rio, with eyes so dark and sunk that Agatha could almost envision with crystal clarity some of the atrocities she may have seen that day. Rio, who in spite of all of that, still found a way to smile the moment their eyes met, toothy and full.</p><p>"Hi," Rio voiced softly as she tore their gazes apart to tend to unfastening her coat. "I... Really <i>really </i>appreciate this. I have no idea how the hell I would have gotten home."</p><p>She really did sound impossibly grateful.</p><p>"It's not a problem, seriously. And selfishly, I didn't want to sit here for the three hours it would have likely taken you, worrying about the insanity this city becomes when things like this happen. I know that <i>you</i> are perfectly capable of handling yourself, so don't mistake the concern for anything other than fretting over the insanity of other people."</p><p>As Rio began to shuck her layers, Agatha was quick and taking them to place them in the closet by the front door, keeping everything bunched together and finishing by tucking the beanie Rio had been wearing into the pocket of the coat.</p><p>When Agatha found them eye to eye again, she could <i>really</i> see it, the way time had treated Rio since they had last been around each other.</p><p>"Are..." Agatha paused, her lips pressing and twisting against each other for a moment. "Are you okay?"</p><p>Rio's face smoothed and a smile found her lips again, even if it was far more tame than the one she'd had to offer when she had first appeared.</p><p>"I am now."</p><p>That was enough of an answer for Agatha, but there was something else on Rio's face. Agatha eyed her, quirking a brow in silent question.</p><p>"But... I might be a little better if you just... could hold me for a minute?"</p><p>For the quickest second, every single barb, every single razor, every single guard and wall that Agatha had always gripped onto for dear life just... disappeared. In the absence of her defenses, Agatha could feel herself melt so severely that she was not sure she could keep it from showing in her expression. So to prevent maximum exposure, she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around Rio's form in a strong and warm embrace.</p><p>For the longest moment, Rio just stayed like that. She didn't bring her own arms up, didn't try to hug Agatha back. But, that wasn't what she asked for. She hadn't asked for a mutual embrace, hadn't even used the word 'hug.' No, Rio had explicitly asked Agatha to <i>hold her.</i> And that was exactly what Agatha did.</p><p>One of Agatha's arms was secured around Rio's waist, but after a moment when she felt Rio's head tip forward to land on her shoulder, the opposite hand lifted and raised to gingerly cradle Rio's head, fingertips raking ever so softly through her hair.</p><p>They stood there, in the front of Agatha's home like that, for several moments. She wasn't sure what pushed her to do it, but Agatha finally broke the silence.</p><p><i>"Bad day?"</i> she questioned softly, fingers still working gently in Rio's hair.</p><p><i>"Understatement," </i>Rio murmured, her breath warm on Agatha's neck from the way her head was laying on that shoulder.</p><p><i>"Do you want to talk about it?" </i>Agatha offered in a genuine show of making sure Rio would know that she could, and Agatha was there to listen if she needed it.</p><p>
<i>"I don't. At least, not right now. Do you think I could have a glass of that bourbon, though?" </i>
</p><p>Agatha's lips curled into a tender smile and she released her hold on Rio to pull back and just... observe her for a few seconds. She was still so beautiful, but it was obvious that the weight of her world was starting to feel a little more than crushing.</p><p>"Are you hungry, too? I can make you a grilled cheese or something. I think I have some tomato soup, too if y--" Agatha had glanced over her shoulder toward the pantry and was still speaking as she turned her head back around, but she had not noticed that Rio had closed the space between them again. Not until Rio's hands found either side of Agatha's face and pulled her in to kiss her.</p><p>She was stunned for the briefest moment. It wasn't exactly commonplace for them to show that affection so quickly upon being in one another's presence. Those kisses were the ones that reserved for the times they parted ways.</p><p>Right then, Rio was making it clear that those rules were out the goddamn window.</p><p>As she seemed to calm and bring the lip lock to a close, Agatha's eyes fluttered back open in utter wonder to take the woman in front of her in. In a very Agatha fashion, one corner of her lips pulled up in something that tried very hard to be a smirk but it missed the mark and landed in a curious smile.</p><p>"What was that for?" Agatha asked her, and while it wasn't accusatory or interrogatory, there was this desire for knowledge that leaked into her tone.</p><p>Rio seemed to consider for a moment, her eyes searching Agatha's face in a show that she was really trying to determine the best way to answer that question.</p><p>"For making choices that you wouldn't have made a month ago. And for making them because of me."</p><p>Once more, Agatha could feel herself softening even if she did a damn good job of not letting her expression betray her.</p><p>She heard loud and clear what Rio was saying.</p><p>Rio was acknowledging something Agatha had spent a great deal of time stewing on, acknowledging just how far Agatha seemed to have come in pulling down her walls. She was calling out the fact that for the first time since they had met, she was standing in Agatha's home. Not only was she standing in Agatha's home, but Agatha was buzzing with energy enough to insist that she could put together a small but hot meal for her because she imagined Rio was starving, cold, and exhausted after what had surely been a hellacious day.</p><p>Agatha took a moment to acknowledge those things too.</p><p>For the first time in an incredibly long time... They did not scare her.</p><p>So, she had given Rio a kiss on the cheek and offered to grab her a change of clothes so that she could get out of the scrubs she was in not only because it had been her battle armor for the day, but because they were now soaked almost all the way up to her knees.</p><p>Rio had thanked her when she had returned a few moments later with a pair of joggers, a couple of different t-shirts that she rarely wore, and even a hoodie with the Harvard 'H' on the front of it. <i>That</i> was a choice Agatha had deliberately made that she knew would indicate her humor. It was one she hoped could make Rio laugh, or at the very least give her a reason to smile.</p><p>In the pile of clothes as Agatha handed them over, though, Rio hadn't been able to notice it. Agatha kept her smile focused as she indicated where the downstairs washroom was and left Rio to sort out her ensemble for the evening.</p><p>By the time Rio returned, Agatha was dropping two pieces of bread coated on one side with a light layer of mayonnaise onto a hot skillet.</p><p>"You little shit," Rio accused, slinging it at Agatha's back though there was no mistaking the undeniable amusement in her voice.</p><p>Agatha's torso shifted so that she could look back behind her and what she saw caused her to sprout a grin that could have been miles wide. There Rio stood, and instead of the black and scarlet hoodie she'd donned in her own apartment, she'd apparently bitten the bullet and realized it was not likely Agatha would offer another sweatshirt based on nothing but principle alone.</p><p>"Hm," Agatha hummed in thought as she turned back to the stove to lay the cheese slices atop the bread. As she did so, her chin tipped over her shoulder again. "It looks good on you."</p><p>She could almost hear as Rio rolled her eyes and made her way over to the counter to Agatha's left, her hand extending to pick up the bottle of bourbon. As she looked down at it, a hand immediately flew out and lightly smacked the side of Agatha's bicep in disbelief.</p><p>"I can't believe you remembered the brand. And also, I can't believe you spent a hundred and fifty bucks on a bottle of bourbon for me." Despite the slight condemnation, Agatha could hear the clear delight as it rang out over Rio's words.</p><p>"I didn't remember what it was called," Agatha countered as she artfully slid the spatula under one of the slices of bread and flipped it atop the other. "But I remembered what it looked like. So, when I saw it, I grabbed it. Figured I could bring it the next time I came over."</p><p>Rio was quiet for a moment as she beheld the bottle, cradling it in both hands like it were a baby.</p><p>"It's just a bottle of alcohol, Rio," Agatha informed her, but even before she finished her sentence, she knew that Rio was going to argue, even in an underhanded and soft way.</p><p>"We both know it's not. So, thank you, Agatha."</p><p>And then she left it at that.</p><p>"Tumblers are in the cabinet by the fridge. There are full ice molds in the freezer. I don't ever use them, but they're there."</p><p>Agatha turned her attention to the soup that was beginning to bubble occasionally and turned it off, removing it from the heat. With one more flip of the sandwich in the pan, Agatha was satisfied by the marbling of golden brown on both sides enough that she turned off that burner, too.</p><p>"Can you grab a plate from that cabinet please?" Agatha requested, nodding her head toward the one she was referring to. Rio stepped up easily and did as she was asked, sliding it over to Agatha.</p><p>In one fluid motion, Agatha lifted the sandwich and slid it onto the plate. Once it was settled, she placed the front edge of the spatula in a line from corner to corner and pressed down, effectively cutting it in half.</p><p>This seemed to tickle Rio as she looked down at the two triangular pieces of the grilled cheese.</p><p>"Thanks, mom," she nearly chirped and it made Agatha wince... for more than one reason.</p><p>"Don't do that," Agatha clipped back, though she did manage to mask the majority of the pain that had pounded her directly in the center of her chest.</p><p>Still, nothing got by Rio. Agatha could see out of the corner of her eyes as Rio's posture softened and she set her glass on the counter, though she didn't let it go. A hand raised and landed on the upper part of Agatha's arm.</p><p>"Hey... I'm sorry. Really. I didn't mean anything by it. I was just being an ass," Rio tried to assure her. She was using that quiet voice, the one that was a little deeper and a little rougher around her words but only in the way that was caused by the tightening of her throat.</p><p>"It's okay," Agatha managed, and the dismissal was the slightest bit surprising, though she realized it was becoming something that was happening a lot more often. "But just... don't do it again, please."</p><p>"I won't, I promise."</p><p>Agatha did not address it further and instead stepped out of Rio's touch and toward where she could open a cabinet door and pull down a bowl for Rio's soup. She was quiet as she ladled some of it inside, though the visualization nearly made her choke.</p><p>It was different, but it was so much the same.</p><p>For about ten seconds, in the recesses of Agatha's mind, she was in a different kitchen in a different part of Massachusetts. The soup before her was chicken noodle, not tomato. The grilled cheese had white cheese instead of the yellow she had <i>just used</i> to make Rio's sandwich.</p><p>In that ninth second, Agatha heard it as if it were shouted in her ear.</p><p>
<i>"Momma, I need ketchup!"</i>
</p><p>Nicky had always loved dipping his grilled cheese in ketchup.</p><p>By the eleventh second, she was back in Avon Hill. She was back in <i>that</i> kitchen, where Rio was stood against the counter, half a foot away.</p><p>There was an incredibly serious threat of tears boiling within her. It was like a boulder that sat, lodged in the very middle of her throat, only this time it was sharp around every edge. Beyond her own understanding, she was gripping at the corner of the counter while she tried to catch her breath.</p><p>She couldn't hear a single sound as Rio said her name.</p><p>She still didn't hear it the second time. Or the third.</p><p>The only reason she heard it the fourth time was because of the firm grip that Rio applied to her bicep. Rio's voice was soft, but it was filled with concern.</p><p>
<i>"Agatha, hey."</i>
</p><p>With a whip of her head, startled blue eyes met dark honey ones and somehow, Agatha remembered to breathe.</p><p>
<i>"What do you need?"</i>
</p><p>With a concentrated show of willpower, Agatha found the ability to swallow down that rock, to free up more of her throat to breathe, to center herself and come back down from that cliff side she had just been staring over the edge of.</p><p>Agatha had yet to shed a single tear, but something in Rio's face said she hadn't needed to.</p><p>"I..." Agatha tried, but she was struggling to really find her voice.</p><p>Rio just looked worried.</p><p>The longer Rio looked like that, the more trapped Agatha felt.</p><p><i>"I'm sorry," </i>Agatha cracked as she pushed off the counter and raced for the bathroom. It was the first place she thought to go where she could just be alone for a second.</p><p>Rio had been in her home for all of fifteen minutes and there Agatha was, toeing the line of having a nervous breakdown for the first time in fucking years. As the door slammed shut, Agatha's back pressed to it and while she did not make a single sound, the tears began to spill furiously.</p><p>Where the fuck had that come from?</p><p>Why now? Why today? Why in front of <i>fucking Rio?!</i></p><p>Agatha had no intentions of doing a deep dive on trying to figure out why, so she simply dug her heels into the moment. She scoured her mind for any and every good thing that could ground her into her current reality.</p><p>Rio was there. Doctor Rio. Did she know how to heal a broken heart? One that had been broken for fifteen years?</p><p>Whether or not she did wasn't what was important. What <i>was</i> important was that she was there.</p><p>There was a <i>lot </i>of snow outside. That snow meant Rio wasn't leaving anytime soon.</p><p>Rio probably didn't <i>want</i> to leave anytime soon, but Agatha was going to make it awkward if she stood in that bathroom trying to stop fucking crying much longer.</p><p>After a few more slow and steadying breaths, she raised both hands to wipe at her face. Even though she knew she shouldn't have, Agatha took a couple of extra moments to splash a bit of cold water on her face in an attempt to alleviate the puffiness that had come from crying.</p><p>With one final breath that filled every single inch of her lungs, Agatha was ready to face Rio again.</p><p>She let herself out of the bathroom and when she entered the open space, she saw Rio standing at the sink as she rinsed out the bowl she had been using. As she rinsed the plate too, she seemed to notice Agatha hovering with her peripherals. Slowly, she set the plate down and turned off the water before she swiveled to face Agatha.</p><p>For as worried as Rio had obviously been, there was something very calm and smooth about the expression she was wearing. She didn't speak a single word as she stepped forward, pacing over to where Agatha stood.</p><p>Agatha wasn't sure what to expect; would Rio kiss her? Would she try to hug her? What could be a reasonable response to what had just happened and her having no clue what caused it?</p><p>Rio's feet stilled about eight inches from Agatha's and she simply reached down, picking up Agatha's hand to fasten it into her own. She turned outward and began to walk toward the living room, pulling Agatha gently behind her. As they reached the couch, Rio let go only once Agatha was directly in front of it.</p><p><i>"Sit down,"</i> Rio instructed softly.</p><p>Agatha just blinked at her.</p><p>She felt like she was in the middle of a hurricane and every thought she had was blowing around the inside of her head with such brute force that stepping into the line of fire would have absolutely sent her reeling. What was the plan here? What were Rio's intentions in that very moment?</p><p>Before Agatha could part her lips in question, there was a sound in the kitchen.</p><p>It was the kettle whistling.</p><p>
<i>"What kind do you want?"</i>
</p><p>An invisible hand had locked around Agatha's throat.</p><p>Rio knew something was wrong. Rio knew Agatha loved tea. Rio had put on the kettle once she realized that Agatha was upset.</p><p>Rio was going to make her tea.</p><p>For a long moment, she just stood there, probably looking like a caught animal who didn't know how to get out of the trap they were stuck in. Her jaw would tense and she would find a way to swallow the pooling of saliva in her mouth and then repeat the process with the kettle still whistling in the background, demanding attention.</p><p>
<i>"I can't pick for you, I don't know shit about tea..."</i>
</p><p>This did something. This poked a large enough hole through Agatha's stunned silence that she was able to form a response.</p><p><i>"Gunpowder green," </i>she managed, though her voice was embarrassingly weak as she got it out.</p><p><i>"Is it labeled?"</i> Rio asked softly and Agatha gave a silent nod in response.</p><p><i>"There's infusers in the drawer..." </i>Agatha offered, though Rio was already moving to cross into the kitchen so that she could silence the kettle.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha just stood there. She had thought that she had braced herself enough that she could act like nothing was wrong. Maybe she might have been able to if Rio wasn't so impossibly intuitive. Maybe she could have found a way to act like it wasn't something that actually had completely fucked with her mentally.</p><p>Would it have mattered?</p><p>Rio had watched her run into that bathroom like a scared kid and she had immediately turned on the kettle with the intent of doing what she hoped might help Agatha. Agatha probably could have sat in that bathroom for an hour and she did not put it past Rio to have simply guessed at a random tea and left it by the door for whenever Agatha was ready for it.</p><p>Finally, Agatha sat down. She was still fighting to regain the control she'd been clinging to when she had opened the bathroom door, the same control that had shattered in her grasp the moment Rio walked over and held her hand like that. She had only been of the mind that she could keep her cool because she had convinced herself that Rio would be oblivious.</p><p>How completely stupid was that thought?</p><p>When had Rio <i>ever</i> been oblivious?</p><p>A moment later, Rio returned with a large mug and when Agatha's eyes fell to the infuser she had chosen, a ghost of a smile graced her lips. The little gray sloth was hanging over the edge of the mug, only claws and face visible. It was the stupidest thing, something she'd bought on a whim when at one of the tea shops, but in that moment there was something about the fact that it was the one Rio had picked that soothed Agatha.</p><p>Rio placed herself on the couch next to Agatha and held out the mug for her to take. Agatha's eyes were fixed on Rio's face, though, trying to ask questions she did not have words for. The only answer Rio provided was to push the mug forward, but there was more there.</p><p>There was that look in Rio's eyes as she looked up from the tea, staring directly into Agatha's blue ones. There was that look on Rio's face, like she understood a conversation that she had not been privy to. There was that slight uptick of Rio's lips that was almost too nervous to turn into the reassuring smile she wanted it to be.</p><p>And then, Rio tipped her head to the side and it was the loudest declaration of <i>IT'S OKAY!</i> that she could have managed without saying a word.</p><p>It was the simplest thing for her to drop her head just slightly.</p><p>Yet, it meant the world to Agatha.</p><p>Slowly, Agatha reached up and pulled the hot ceramic out of Rio's grasp, not paying any mind to the fact that it was almost too hot to hold. She shifted, leaning forward slightly so that she could set it down on the coffee table that was in front of them. As she leaned back, she shifted in her spot so that she could turn sideways with a leg tucked under her so that she could face Rio.</p><p>The question in Rio's eyes was obvious, but Agatha didn't waste any time in giving her an answer.</p><p>She reached up with the hand that was closest to the back of the couch and laid it gingerly against the side of Rio's neck, fingers hooking into the flesh that covered vertebrae so that she could pull her forward.</p><p>Rio didn't resist. She let it happen.  And when Agatha kissed her?</p><p>The docile and sweet Rio that had just made her tea seemed to dissipate into thin air and the Rio that was willing to devour Agatha whole appeared in her place.</p><p>There might have been about two to three seconds where that kiss could have been called tender and then, it was over. Instead, their lips were crushing together so hard that Agatha was almost certain one of them might bleed. And then it was the dance, the sucking of lips and nibbling of teeth on skin. Part of Agatha wanted it to hurt, wanted Rio to put a little more force into those nips. She wanted Rio to spark those neurons, to make her feel absolutely anything than the anxiety she'd felt in that kitchen.</p><p>So she kissed Rio harder, hotter. She shoved her tongue into Rio's mouth with little regard and felt her heart hammer harder when Rio offered the pushback Agatha was aching for. She needed the battle, the power struggle in those moments.</p><p>Agatha needed for Rio to be Rio.</p><p>Agatha's hand had started to move, sliding up into Rio's hair as fingers curled around what strands she could grasp. She used it as leverage, to bring Rio closer and closer even though there was no actual space left between them and Agatha was practically taking swipes at the uvula that hung at the back of Rio's throat.</p><p>The way their teeth kept colliding was almost enough to be painful, but Agatha didn't care. Rio was there. Rio cared. Rio was going to let Agatha do whatever it was she needed to do to feel better without putting Rio's own well being on the line in the process.</p><p>Agatha didn't want to hurt Rio. If anything, it could have been said that she wanted Rio to hurt her, but there were extreme limits on that being a possibility. Agatha was aching for anything to tell her she was alive, that she wasn't buried and suffocated in her memories, and if forking over some modicum of control might help? She was willing to try.</p><p>Agatha gave a firm tug on Rio's hair at the same time she retracted her tongue from Rio's mouth, eyes opening to see Rio's exposed neck. She could have jumped right in, but that wasn't what she wanted. She released her hold and for a brief moment as she leaned back, Rio looked confused again. Agatha did not leave much room to question before she spoke.</p><p><i>"Strip down,"</i> she instructed and while it was obvious that she was starved for this, Agatha's voice was not bossy or authoritative by any measure.</p><p>Rio hesitated just long enough that Agatha realized she was going to have to prove that she wasn't bluffing. She pushed herself to her feet and pulled off the fleece sweatshirt she had on, flinging it somewhere behind her. As she removed her t-shirt and did the same thing, Rio finally caught up and was on her feet, shedding her own layers.</p><p>In a flurry of movement and an entire duration of less than a minute, they were both stark naked and hands were back on bodies, this time gripping and sinking into skin. Although Agatha was usually the one to immediately start ravishing Rio, it had taken Agatha's five second delay for Rio to pick up on the fact that the tables were actively turning where they stood.</p><p>Agatha had hoped that Rio would notice and engage.</p><p>But Rio always had her questions, no matter how valid they were.</p><p>Rio used her hold on both of Agatha's sides to pull her closer so that their fronts pressed, breasts flattening the slightest bit in shape with the force they imbued upon one another. But Rio didn't kiss her, despite how close they were. Instead, those dark eyes found Agatha's, looking down into them, the question already there.</p><p><i>"Don't ask me what I need," </i>Agatha had tried to growl, but it came out in a tone of voice that sounded almost downright pathetic.</p><p><i>"Okay,"</i> Rio offered back, but she wasn't finished. <i>"What do you <b>want?</b>"</i></p><p>This was a valid question. It was also a question that Agatha was not entirely sure how to answer at first. The words weren't forming the way she had hoped they might, weren't stringing together in the way she needed them to. Instead, she tried to find a way to do it without them.</p><p>Her hands dropped from where they had absentmindedly landed on Rio's shoulders and slid down the length of her arms all the way to her hands. She covered them with her own and then pressed -- hard. She shifted her palms back to Rio's fingers and pressed again so that her nails sank into the pliable flesh there. Her eyes slid shut at the feeling. Even though it was technically self-inflicted, the thrill of it caused a whispered moan to filter through her lips.</p><p><i>"Agatha," </i>Rio managed, her breath hot on Agatha's face. <i>"I need you to tell me."</i></p><p>Her eyes opened into Rio's and while her immediate inclination was to be irritated, to be upset that Rio was forcing compliance, she simply couldn't. Perhaps it was because some locked away part of her realized that Rio wasn't actually forcing her hand. Rio was offering her a means to control this interaction when clearly, Agatha felt so very out of control.</p><p><i>"I want you to hurt me without fucking me," </i>Agatha answered finally, though there was something about the request that almost tasted sour as it passed over her tongue.</p><p>Without another word spoken, Rio seemed to realize what was being asked of her. As much as Agatha could tell Rio disliked not being able to reciprocate in these situations, she could also tell that she understood why.</p><p>Agatha's hands removed themselves but the grip there grew stronger. At the same time, Rio's head dropped and tucked into Agatha's neck, lips meeting flesh hungrily.</p><p>Maybe it was awkward to be stood there in the middle of her living room butt naked like that as Rio began to consume whatever inch of flesh she could get to, but Agatha didn't care. The more she felt Rio pressing and squeezing roughly at her hips and sides and ass, the closer she tried to pull herself to the other woman.</p><p>Agatha's chest had started to heave a bit as Rio sucked at her neck, at different places up and down the length of it for long enough each time that Agatha knew exactly what she was doing. Not only was she complying with Agatha's request, but she was getting her own payback. Joke was on Rio, though; Agatha didn't have class for the next two weeks.</p><p>It was when Rio sank her teeth into the muscle of Agatha's shoulder that Agatha realized just how much Rio understood the assignment. A low moan rattled from deep within Agatha's lungs and while her hands had been idling on Rio's sides previously, one of them raised to cradle the back of her head again, a silent encouragement to keep going.</p><p>Instead, Rio lifted her head. The question and panic was immediate in Agatha's eyes, but it hardly had time to register before Rio's grip tightened even further and she shifted her weight, using the momentum to practically throw Agatha onto the couch, leaving her sat upright against the back of it.</p><p>Woah.</p><p>
<i>That was hot.</i>
</p><p>Rio eyed her like a hawk at the top of a tree, staring down at the prey it was about to make a lunge for.</p><p>Agatha's chest was still moving in rapid succession of inhales and exhales and the look in her eye bordered on wild, but it was only because she was anticipating what Rio was going to do next. She had been following the plan pretty well, but that moment of silence was a slight hiccup.</p><p>Then, Rio dropped to her knees in front of Agatha.</p><p>Rio's dark eyes lifted and met Agatha evenly from where she sat on her heels. She did not look away as she raised a hand and pressed the back of it to the inside of Agatha's knee. She did not do anything else, did not apply any pressure. Agatha listened to the silent demand anyway and separated her knees, readjusting her feet so that her legs were spread.</p><p>Rio read the tension that was there despite the compliance.</p><p>Rio scooted forward the slightest bit so that she had the position for what she wanted to accomplish. As she leaned toward Agatha and turned her head to press a kiss to the inside of her knee, she whispered softly against the skin there.</p><p>
<i>"You can trust me."</i>
</p><p>To punctuate such a statement, Rio sank her teeth into a slightly meatier spot a little higher up Agatha's thigh.</p><p>Agatha heard it, what Rio was really saying.</p><p>
<i>'You can put yourself in vulnerable situations and I will still respect what you ask of me.'</i>
</p><p>Rio wasn't going to make a push for what she might have wanted because she understood that Agatha's wants and needs were more important than her own in the circumstances they had landed themselves in.</p><p>Agatha's hand raised to slide once more into Rio's hair, but the grip was gone this time. Instead, she just needed to feel her there and to know that if there happened to be something that she did not like, she could redirect with ease.</p><p>It was at that point that she realized Rio knew what she was doing. She was leaving trails of hickeys up and down Agatha's thighs, occasionally using her tongue to soothe the bitemarks she was leaving as well. She was digging her nails into the outside of those thighs, raking them roughly through fields of soft skin.</p><p>As she moved higher, though, Agatha tensed. Rio understood it and instead seemed to change tactics.</p><p>She rocked back in a way that allowed her to get to her feet, towering over Agatha once more. Before she made her demand, though, her gaze swept over Agatha's legs to survey her handiwork. Those full lips curled into a smirk just before she spoke.</p><p>
<i>"Lay back. I've got miles to go before I sleep."</i>
</p><p>Agatha's expression went entirely blank for just a moment. The demand would have been something she could have met with ease, but it was the addendum that had really struck something in her chest, something that was dangerously close to her heart.</p><p>Rio was quoting Robert Frost at her in the middle of ravaging every inch of Agatha's body that Agatha would let her get to.</p><p>And Agatha had never been so turned on in her life.</p><p>She complied after another stunned moment, laying along the length of the couch. Rio wasted absolutely no time as she climbed over Agatha's legs so that she could lower her lips to kiss around Agatha's navel.</p><p>Rio spent the next length of time licking and sucking and biting and scratching her way across both of Agatha's hips, over her abdomen and ribs. She had taken a little longer when it came to Agatha's breasts and for a moment, Agatha wondered if Rio was aware that she'd made Agatha come twice in that time.</p><p>The first had been when she had bit her nipple almost hard enough to suck the breath out of her lungs and the second had been when she'd licked her way up the center of Agatha's sternum.</p><p>By the time Rio's entire body was over Agatha's and the trail Rio's tongue had been taking up the middle of Agatha's throat ended at the edge of her chin, Agatha felt <i>satisfied.</i></p><p>Before any other thought could strike her, the entire room went dark. No lights, no fans, no humming of electricity.</p><p>The power had finally gone out. The only light source left in the room was the orange hues from the fire that was still burning in the stone hollow.</p><p>In the moment, it was almost like neither of them noticed.</p><p>Rio's face hovered above hers for only a moment before it dropped and their lips met in another kiss. This time, though, it wasn't forceful or desperate. It wasn't crushing or heavy. This time, when Rio kissed her, it felt like victory.</p><p>Agatha had found it in herself to ask for what she wanted, and Rio had given it to her without question. More than that, Rio had found a way to put her own flourish on it and every single bit of it had worked. In those moments, Agatha was not thinking about white cheese and chicken noodle soup. All Agatha was thinking about was how badly she wanted to make Rio come.</p><p>So even though that kiss had been a gentle showing of Rio's affection, Agatha needed to make it perfectly clear that she wanted more. Her tongue was working again, running along Rio's lips, tucking behind her teeth and she could feel as Rio's body began to press toward hers more in need.</p><p>When she pulled away, she reached up to cradle the entirety of Rio's jaw in her firm grasp so that she could direct Rio's head to the side in order to disclose something right into her ear.</p><p>
<i>"What I want now is for you to ride my face. That way I can save us both you asking."</i>
</p><p>Although Agatha expected Rio to leap into action, what she did instead was a bit of a surprise.</p><p>Rio laughed. She tilted her head out of Agatha's grasp so that she could look back down at her again and she was wearing one devilish smirk.</p><p><i>"You're learning," </i>she stated, lifting her hand to give Agatha's cheek an instigative tap. <i>"Good girl."</i></p><p>
<i>Oh fuck.</i>
</p><p><i>"Rio,"</i> Agatha growled, but Rio was moving before she could offer any further protest.</p><p>The way Rio moved her body sometimes was quite unreal. She was so graceful, so able in her way to flow through any space she occupied.</p><p>There was something so goddamn sexy about it, the way she set herself where she needed to be, her core positioned right above Agatha's face.</p><p>Something Agatha noticed immediately was that the insides of Rio's thighs were damp and sticky to about halfway down. As Agatha curiously raised a hand and slid it under her from behind to run a finger through Rio's wet warmth, she had not been expecting to nearly drown.</p><p>At the realization, a sinister smirk curled Agatha's lips this time. Her hands were moving, fingertips nearly digging in as they landed on Rio's hip bones and pushed her where Agatha wanted her with the leverage she'd garnered.</p><p>The moment she sank her tongue into Rio's heat, she realized that she was not going to be able to get enough. She wanted more already and she'd just started. She'd been guiding the intensity with her own grip for a few minutes but she could feel Rio growing a little more desperate, especially when her hand landed in Agatha's hair.</p><p>One of Agatha's hands loosened its hold on Rio's hip and curved inward, her finger finding its destination as it curled into Rio from behind. This caused a sudden and rough shift in Rio's hips so more of that wet and warm arousal filled every bit of Agatha's mouth.</p><p>It had taken less than two minutes of that for Rio to completely shatter in a brand of orgasm Agatha had yet to bear witness to. It was delicious, it was glorious, and it was... actually kind of beautiful, if she let herself be honest for a moment.</p><p>It was in the minutia, in the way that Rio's thighs squeezed Agatha's head slightly. It was in the way she rocked forward and threw down a hand to support herself on the arm of the couch as she rode out every wave that ripped through her. It was in the way her breath kept catching in her chest and she had to force herself to remember the automatic action.</p><p>Agatha, who had stilled as Rio came, slowly removed her finger and, at the same time, gave one last flat swipe of her tongue to garner every bit of sex she could swallow.</p><p>Rio exhaled a soft whimper and Agatha gave the cheek of her ass a soft smack to encourage her to move. She had started to shift to lay herself atop Agatha, but Agatha signified for her to wait just a second. She sat up a little and reached over the back of the couch, grabbing one of the blankets she'd gotten out earlier in the night from where it sat on the table there.</p><p>Agatha gave a silent nod as she laid back against the cushions and Rio folded on top of her. Working around the body on top of her, Agatha managed to unfurl the blanket in a way that allowed her to drape it over Rio's back, covering the both of them. Rio had tucked her head to lay on Agatha's chest and Agatha simply held her there.</p><p>She let those blue eyes close in the darkness of the room, focusing on that familiar lullaby of the sounds Rio made when she breathed.</p><p>It had taken her little time to fall asleep.</p><p>When Agatha awoke, she was immediately aware that she was alone on the couch, even before she opened her eyes. It was in the way she couldn't feel Rio's skin. It was in the way it was replaced with the fabric of that blanket instead.</p><p>Slowly, she sat up and turned her attention to the dimly lit room in front of her.</p><p>What she saw stopped her heart in her chest for so long that she was convinced this was what it felt like to die.</p><p>On the floor, relatively close to the fireplace, sat Rio who was wrapped in a blanket. That was not the part that was currently sucking every last bit of life out of Agatha.</p><p>The part that was actively killing her in that moment was that in front of Rio was a book. Not just any book,<i> Agatha's </i>book, and a couple of loose leaves of paper pushed around it.</p><p>Agatha wanted to die. Literally, in that moment, she prayed that somehow some freak accident would happen and she would not have to keep moving forward on a path where facing this moment was inevitable.</p><p>Rio was studying a piece of paper, one that Agatha was almost certain she knew what was written on it. It was one of the few she had written since the two weeks she'd heard hide nor hair from Rio.</p><p>
<i>In a chaos of collision, the to-and-fro never dies. Only gentle hands cradle opposition, both anguish and joy palmed and tied together by fate. The black ebbs and flows, insistent cycles of departures and arrivals, true as time. The sun of dark pools, illuminating through despair to catch a bloom of pink, of purple, of white. Even through perishing can there be life.</i>
</p><p>Agatha just watched her as she read it, as the words settled within her. As she understood them, Rio's posture changed. It sagged a little in a way that told Agatha she completely comprehended every word she had read. Then, she set it down and picked up another that was on the same stationary.</p><p>
<i>The building has no arms, yet the hold is too tight. The titanium often rings too cold, the fluorescents blare too bright. Even as laughter sounds in valleys of despondency, they turn into echoes of the nothing. Frailty forever lends to heartache, suffocating when the hold of the building tightens. Newness, vivid and blinding brings change that lay untouched for years. Discomfort only brings with it new opportunities.</i>
</p><p>Somewhere in the middle of it, Agatha had heard it.</p><p>Rio had started to cry.</p><p>She shifted, reaching up to wipe at her face, though she didn't put the poem down. Instead, she appeared to read through it at least two more times depending on how fast of a reader she was.</p><p>Agatha was completely stuck on that couch, watching a woman who clearly cared for her shed tears over the thoughts Agatha sometimes had rattling around in her mind.</p><p>The one miniscule part of her that wanted to be upset by the invasion of privacy was immediately silenced by a thought of the first morning she had woken up in Rio's bed. When Rio had been in the shower, Agatha had snooped, too. Rio just hadn't caught her.</p><p><i>"Doing some light reading?" </i>Agatha fired off into the cool night, but it wasn't hostile or pointed. It was quiet, it was curious.</p><p>Rio's head snapped back to take in Agatha and her eyes were nearly as wide as plates. She looked like a kid who had been caught with their had in the cookie jar. She looked guilty. That in and of itself told Agatha that she realized just how heavy what she was holding actually was.</p><p>
<i>"I... I didn't realize what it was when I pulled it... and then the first page drew me in. And these... they just fell out. I..."</i>
</p><p>Before Rio was finished, Agatha was moving. She pushed to her feet and brought her blanket with her, placing herself on the ground directly behind Rio, legs on either side of her hips. Though it was a little awkward at first, Agatha found a way to wrap her arms around Rio's middle as she set her chin on Rio's shoulder, peering down at the second poem she'd been holding.</p><p><i>"I know you want to ask," </i>Agatha murmured softly in a teasing encouragement, so close to Rio's ear.</p><p>
<i>"Are these... about me?"</i>
</p><p>Agatha tipped her head forward and placed a kiss to the blanket that was covering Rio's shoulder.</p><p>
<i>"They are."</i>
</p><p>
<i>"Agatha..."</i>
</p><p>
<i>"Before you even start, I saw what you were working on that morning I woke up and you were in the chair. So... It's just a mutual admiration in different art forms."</i>
</p><p>Rio seemed to digest this, at first, but then she slipped right into understanding. They were artists at heart and they'd each found a way to express their appreciation in quiet ways that they thought only they would know of.</p><p>They sat, situated like that, for a few quiet and long moments. What Agatha had been unaware of was that there was more Rio wanted to ask. It took another couple of minutes for her to gather the courage.</p><p>Rio's head lifted and turned slightly, looking over at the bookshelf she had found Agatha's journal on. Her eyes fell on a small picture frame that held a 3x5 photo inside of it. Agatha noted the movement and followed Rio's gaze, her heart stopping for the second time.</p><p>No.</p><p>Rio couldn't.</p><p>She couldn't ask <i>that </i>question.</p><p>And then, she did.</p><p>
<i>"Who's the little boy?"</i>
</p><p>In a moment where Agatha should have flown to her feet and stomped up the stairs, a moment where she should have thrown up her walls and pushed Rio out into the snow -- naked or not -- she chose to do something else instead.</p><p>She chose to wrap her arms tighter around Rio's middle. She chose to press her face into Rio's shoulder in silent indication that she was going to need time to form that answer.</p><p>What she did not choose to do in that moment was run away.</p><p>It took her so long that Rio had checked more than once that she was awake, knowing better than to ask if she was okay. Finally, Agatha found her voice even though she did not move her face from the way it was pressed to the blanket.</p><p>
<i>"He was my son."</i>
</p><p>She could feel as the gravity of the question she had asked finally settled into Rio's form. When she had asked it, she had surely not anticipated that kind of answer. At the same time, it seemed to shuffle quite a few pieces into place in Rio's mind. She moved a hand to rest on Agatha's arm the moment she felt it everywhere as Agatha began to cry.</p><p>Despite her tears, though, she kept going.</p><p>
<i>"He died from Leukaemia three months after his fifth birthday, fifteen years ago. The same day, fifteen years later, I got hit by a car and saw a pretty doctor in my dream."</i>
</p><p>At this, it was Rio's turn to start trembling as her tears started back up again.  It only made Agatha hold on tighter.</p><p>They stayed in the devastation of the moment, just crying softly and clinging to one another, both through Agatha's hold on Rio's middle and Rio's grip on Agatha's arm. It was the first time Agatha had ever let herself be honest with someone about Nicky, let alone the first time anyone she'd come into contact with after his passing had ever learned of his existence.</p><p>Agatha was hoping, though, that Rio did not want to keep digging in that spot for the time being. There might come a day when Agatha could talk about him, could state all of the things she had loved so much about him, but not then.</p><p>She was thankful, after a few more moments of silence, that Rio's next words were the exact opposite of digging.</p><p><i>"I lost someone, too. I... It's not the same, but..." </i>She drew in a soft breath as if the find some form of courage to keep going which made Agatha feel a little bit better about her own admission. <i>"I was in a relationship that... It wasn't great, but the sex was incredible so we stayed together. It was stupid but I didn't have the time or energy to start dating again. We just..." </i>Rio exhaled a soft sigh, her head hanging a little bit.</p><p><i>"We fought. A lot. One night, it was icy out and we were trying to get back to the city after a wine tasting at a garden center. She was driving and we were yelling back and forth about the fact that she thought I was hitting on the organizer. I told her she was..." </i>Rio shook with a soft sob right before she wiped at her face with the hand that didn't have an ironclad grip on Agatha's arm.</p><p>
<i>"I called her a 'stupid bitch,' which was very out of character for me. And she turned on me and lost control of the car. When I came to, I had sustained a minorly punctured lung, a broken arm and I broke twelve bones in my right foot. When I looked over, she was... dying."</i>
</p><p>Agatha might not have been ready to delve into the painful memories of the kind of happiness having Nicky in her life had brought her, but Rio seemed to be ready to let Agatha know that death was more of life than anyone wanted to admit, and that didn't always have to be a bad thing.</p><p><i>"I ignored my own pain to try to save her. No matter what I did, it wouldn't have mattered."</i> Rio paused, her lungs filling very slowly with the breath she pulled in. "<i>So... I guess that's my way of telling you that I know what it's like to feel like you can't save someone, even deeper than what that means in terms of my job. And it's also my way of letting you know that you're not alone."</i></p><p>Agatha's face moved to press into the hair on the back of Rio's head as the tears started falling hot and fast again.</p><p>
<i>"And if I have anything to say about it... And I can be convincing enough... You won't ever have to be, again."</i>

<p>There had been a heaviness, an undeniable weight that had settled over two two of them as they sat, Agatha wrapped around Rio from behind, fighting off the chill that had started to creep into Agatha's home. At first, it had felt to Agatha as though an anvil had been dropped, completely shattering any sense of decorum she had been fighting so hard to keep. The longer they stayed there, the more it started to feel like a weighted blanket instead. It was heavy, but there was some form of reprieve in feeling it settle.</p><p>That tension had loosened almost entirely as Agatha leaned over Rio's shoulder and whispered the suggestion in her ear that they could go upstairs and climb into Agatha's big bed with its giant pile of blankets.</p><p>The response Rio had to offer caused an unexpected squeezing of Agatha's heart in her chest.</p><p>Rio had simply turned her head just enough that her temple brushed the tip of Agatha's nose, and at the same time, her grip tightened just slightly on Agatha's arm. The act itself was innocent enough, and Rio hadn't spoken a word. She didn't need to. She was so loud, the way she was telling Agatha that she would go anywhere right then, so long as they went together.</p><p>Agatha's arms didn't move right away and instead wrapped a little more firmly around Rio's middle, still feeling the weight of the conversation they'd had as it draped over them.</p><p>Agatha should have been scared. She should have been worried that she had <i>finally,</i> after fifteen years, been honest with someone about her past. No one else in her life had ever been given the privilege of knowing about Nicky. He was Agatha's, and had always been hers alone, both in life and in memory.</p><p>That was different now. Now, Rio knew. Now, Rio had the biggest piece of Agatha she could have ever gotten.  Rio held in her hands the one thing in Agatha's life that could destroy her if Rio chose to ever weaponize it. It should have been the most terrifying thing, but when Agatha looked at Rio?</p><p>Rio was a healer, inherently, in her bones. Rio tended to the sick and dying, she cared for those in crisis because it was who she was as a human being. She saw life, she saw death, and she saw every shade of grey in between. It was why she wore the flowers. Agatha had already assumed as much, but when she really thought about it, she realized that the grey of a Boston winter had little to do with it.</p><p>It was the greys of Rio's life that pained her in a way that forced her to remember the colors, too.</p><p>It made Agatha think about the spring. It made her think that if Rio's greenhouse looked like <i>that,</i> her backyard must be a sight when the warmer air came through. It made Agatha think that she wanted to have the chance to see for herself.</p><p>That should have been an alarming thought in and of itself but as Agatha released her hold on the woman before her, hands landing on Rio's sides as she gave a brief nuzzle into the back of her head, it actually felt a little calming.</p><p>Agatha had three years on her timeline left. She was under no impression that Rio would even want to be a cause for her to outstay that, as that was a great distance away, but the thought that she might be able to at least garner a few months of being understood and fascinated by this soothing presence in the meantime didn't stir anxiety in Agatha like it might have mere months ago.</p><p>The two of them got to their feet, still wrapped in their blankets, as the last of the flames began to die down in the stone fireplace, leaving embering coals in their place. Agatha held up a silent finger as she paced toward the kitchen and grabbed hold of the bottle of bourbon before returning to Rio.</p><p>While still pinning her blanket to her chest with the hand that was now wrapped around the neck of the glass bottle, Agatha reached down with the other to take Rio's, using it as a tether to guide her through a floorplan that was new to her. The stairs creaked only faintly during their ascension and the hardwood at the top of them felt ice cold.</p><p>Agatha pulled her down the hallway, every door along it wide open, nothing guarded when Agatha had never expected to let anyone in. It wasn't much to see, just a guest room, a spare bathroom, and an office with two walls filled with more bookshelves that were crammed with literature. It was still unprotected pieces of Agatha that she had most assuredly never expected anyone else to see, least of all Rio.</p><p>There was a linen closet door directly at the end of the hall, but Agatha turned right and tugged Rio through another doorway, one that opened up into her bedroom.</p><p>In it, there was a large bed -- a california king, which was assuredly too big for one person -- that was against the far wall, directly in the middle of it. On the walls, there were frames that were filled with mostly empty space, but in the center were pressed flowers and leaves that had come from each and every place Agatha had spent time, ones that were native to only the soil in which they had grown.</p><p>As she stole a glance over at Rio who caught view of a couple of them in the dim light of the moon outside, she could see something close to a flicker of recognition, but Rio left it unacknowledged.</p><p>Rio saw Agatha. She saw Agatha for who she really was.</p><p>Rio didn't feel the need to shout it, just because she could.</p><p>The understanding instead fell heavier in the silence, and that was something Rio had always known.</p><p>The rest of the room was rather unexciting; there was a nightstand on either side of the bed, although Agatha almost always slept on the right, which left the stand on the opposite side barren and empty. There were a few odds and ends in the drawer of it, but by and large there wasn't much need for it. There were two oak dressers placed on adjoining walls and in the corner by the bed sat the smallest desk. Atop it, there was a mess of papers as well as a pen and the tiniest little desk lamp, fitting for how compact the desk itself was.</p><p>It was clearly the space Agatha occupied in the early hours of the morning when she could not seem to befriend sleep. It was the place she dumped the demons of the night onto paper in an attempt to shut her mind off.</p><p><i>"Go on," </i>Agatha encouraged softly, tipping her chin toward the bed in indication. She released her hold on Rio's hand and shifted the bottle to her now empty one, handing it over to Rio. Once the exchange was complete, Agatha paced over to the closet door and opened it, sliding inside for only a moment before she emerged with an arm full of blankets. Sure, the duvet was thick and warm, but it was going to be <i>cold.</i></p><p>Under any other circumstances, Agatha would have been bursting at the seams to relive her days in Iceland in those moments. Right then, though, it was the last thing on her mind.</p><p>As her eyes lifted, the sight of Rio propped against the headboard and having rearranged her blanket to cover her shoulders all the way down to her ankles -- her feet were bare and sticking out due to the length of the blanket -- pulled at emotions inside of Agatha that had been long forgotten. In fact, Agatha was not sure that she could put a memory to the last time she had felt such adoration, such admiration, such affection for another human being.</p><p>It actually made Agatha laugh. It wasn't a boisterous laugh, wasn't obnoxious or loud. Instead, it was merely a breath of a chuckle as it tumbled from between parted lips.</p><p><i>"Is something funny?"</i> Rio posed, tilting her head in curiosity. The paleness of what light of the moon was visible through the clouds outside was casting across her features in a way that made her look like a piece of art.</p><p><i>"You could have just gotten under the duvet instead of leaving your toes to get frostbitten,"</i> Agatha informed her, almost admonishingly, as she padded over to the bed. She reached down for her corner of the duvet and gave it a tug as she pulled it back, a silent demand that Rio shuffle to accommodate the request for movement.</p><p>As Rio moved, Agatha pulled the duvet back as far as she could without it falling off the foot of the bed and set to the task of unfolding a couple of the blankets, shaking them out to lay across the mattress though they were nowhere near large enough to cover it entirely. The way Rio was perched on the pillows, knees tucked to her chest, was cause for the giggle she elicited when the top of the first blanket graced the backs of her toes, tickling them just slightly.</p><p>That was a sound. It was a beautiful sound. It was a sound that was warm and comforting in a way that almost startled Agatha.</p><p>They were there, in that townhome, in the middle of an awful snowstorm with no power and Agatha actually felt... happy.</p><p>She wasn't thrilled about the conditions themselves, but she was relieved to not be alone. She didn't have to be alone anymore. Rio had made it a point to assert that, to make sure Agatha really heard her when she said it.</p><p>Rio had called her out that day in the hospital, both verbally and in her actions. She had made it very clear to Agatha that she knew what it meant to be alone, to not really feel like there was anyone around who got it. It hadn't really offended Agatha as much as it probably would have if she hadn't just been hit by a car, but being seen so plainly, even in hindsight, was something Agatha had desperately needed.</p><p>She had worn masks, swapping them out every time she stepped off a plane in a new country. Settling in Boston had brought about even the smallest bits of change, in that the masks were worn less and less and she didn't see much use for most of them anymore. Sure, she still had her armor, but being someone else for the sake of not being herself had fallen by the wayside.</p><p>Even before Agatha had laid out the second blanket, Rio had already slid her legs beneath the first. She was so effortlessly cute, just doing the tiniest things that probably seemed insignificant to her, but meant just a little more to Agatha than she would ever let on. The way she was just propped against the pillows, her original blanket back over her shoulders like a cape and that bottle of bourbon clutched in one uncovered hand, she was just so... <i>wholesome.</i></p><p>After the second blanket lay atop the first, Agatha reached down and pulled the duvet back up to increase insulation. Finally, with her own blanket still draped over her back and shoulders, Agatha climbed into the bed next to Rio. Her initial instinct was to leave space if Rio wanted it, but it took only a three second battle of wills to convince herself that if Rio needed space, she was exactly the kind of person to make it known.</p><p>Their sides were instantly flush with the way that Agatha sidled up to Rio, already knowing she was not going to need to deliver the whole 'it's cold and body heat, y'know?' spiel. In fact, Agatha could almost swear she felt Rio scooch a little closer, though there hadn't been any space for her to actually move.</p><p>Rio's hands were working, unscrewing the lid on the bourbon before she brought it to her lips and took a long pull, one long enough that left Agatha's eyes wide in wonder. Rio lowered the bottle, grimacing only slightly at the sting of the alcohol before her head turned and she held it out to Agatha.</p><p>For once in her life, when Agatha looked at that dark brown liquid, she didn't feel the need to chug the whole thing until she passed out only to wake up in the morning with a raging headache that made her angry with herself. When she looked at it in that moment, she saw it as a way to keep warm, a way to soothe the aches they were both now sporting from trudging through memories that were painful.</p><p>With a cautious hand, Agatha reached out and took hold of the neck, bringing it up to take a pull of her own. It burned, but the taste wasn't atrocious. For a bourbon, it really wasn't that bad.</p><p>And so, they had sat, passing that bottle back and forth only a couple of times over the course of twenty minutes. There wasn't much conversation, but there didn't need to be. They had both said more than enough that night.</p><p>When Rio offered Agatha one last pull and she declined, Rio twisted the lid back onto the bottle and leaned over to set it on the empty nightstand.</p><p><i>"I'm pretty tired,"</i> Rio offered in a smooth murmur, scooting down the slightest bit to show that it was her intention to sleep.</p><p><i>"Of course. You've had a really long day,"</i> Agatha offered back, glancing over at her to provide a ghost of a smile.</p><p>The look in Rio's eyes told Agatha that in the way Rio was constantly making her ask for what it was she wanted or needed, Rio was not above doing so herself.</p><p>
<i>"I would really like it if you laid down with me, even if you're not ready to sleep yet."</i>
</p><p>Directly in her center, somewhere above her stomach but not quite into her ribs, Agatha felt white hot. She felt like that heat was going to expand, to bloat her to a point of exploding with the burning of a thousand suns. She had laid next to Rio to sleep on a couple of occasions, now, and yet, being explicitly asked in that manner, she knew there was more to it. Agatha knew that this wasn't just about sleeping, or even sleeping in the same bed.</p><p>Agatha knew that it had everything to do with the way she had woken up in the late hours of the night to find Rio asleep and cuddling against her side, arm draped over Agatha's middle and all. It was in how Rio's slumbering subconscious had sought and found comfort in a physical closeness with Agatha. It was how it had only panicked Agatha for a grand total of three minutes before she'd been calm enough to go back sleep.</p><p>Agatha did not fortify her response with a verbal answer and instead copied Rio's motion of sliding down onto the mattress to lay flat on her back. Rio adjusted to lay down, too, but she had turned on her side, though there was an inch or two of space between them as they were under those layers of blankets.</p><p>There was quiet for only a moment before it was jostled apart by a soft whisper from Rio.</p><p><i>"Can I touch you? Just... touch. No snuggling, no cuddling. I just... want to feel your skin is all." </i>It was such an earnest request that it was quite jarring for Agatha.</p><p>This was impossibly evident in the fact that for a moment, she just stopped moving. She wasn't breathing, her eyes weren't moving, and she was completely still as she contemplated the gravity of such a question, and all of its qualifiers. Slowly, she turned her head to take Rio in, the shadows so soft as they hugged her every feature.</p><p>
<i>"If you want to be close, that's okay too."</i>
</p><p>It wasn't just a step for Agatha, it was a leap. For the first time, someone was in her home. For the first time, she was giving that same someone the permission to be physically close to her in a way that was not immediately conducive to having sex. For the first time, Agatha was getting out of her own way to allow someone to show her affection, someone who clearly wanted to show it but was respectful of the fact that Agatha might not be ready to receive it.</p><p><i>"Are you sure?" </i>Rio asked back and Agatha could clearly hear the concern, the desire to know for certain that this was something Agatha was actually okay with as opposed to just giving in out of guilt or something similar.</p><p><i>"I'm sure. C'mere,"</i> Agatha answered, lifting a bare arm from under the blanket to open a space for Rio to fit herself against Agatha's side, skin to skin in a way that would better warm them both.</p><p>It barely took a second for Rio to react, managing to move forward as she fit herself right into that spot, her head laying to rest on Agatha's hickey-covered chest. Agatha adjusted the blankets, pulling them up as high as she could without covering Rio's face. The hand that released the blankets then moved to run gentle fingertips through Rio's hair.</p><p>Rio's own fingertips moved to a spot she couldn't see, but Agatha felt it and knew exactly what she was doing. It might not have been exact without the ability to visually gauge, but Rio's touch was circling the spot on the inside of her left breast that had been marked with the impression of Rio's teeth. It shouldn't have, but the realization caused Agatha's heart to skip a beat or two in her chest. It almost stilled then, when Rio spoke again.</p><p>
<i>"You're okay, right?"</i>
</p><p>Agatha softened for what felt like the millionth time that night.</p><p>
<i>"I'm fine, Rio. I promise. You did exactly what I asked you to do."</i>
</p><p>Rio was quiet for a moment, the lightest touch still skating over Agatha's skin.</p><p><i>"And that... works for you?"</i> Though her words were airy in the stillness of the night, Agatha could still hear the uncertainty. To diffuse the tension, Agatha breathed a soft chuckle, her hand on Rio's shoulder beginning a back and forth motion over her skin.</p><p><i>"I came twice alone when you were marking up my chest. Especially the tongue thing up the middle. Jesus Christ."</i> Her words were light in delivery, but they were honest. At this revelation, she could feel the trepidation melt out of Rio's muscles, right beneath Agatha's touch. Agatha's lips twisted in thought beyond Rio's purview for just a moment. <i>"Is that important to you? That I get off, I mean?"</i></p><p>For just a second, Agatha could feel as Rio stilled there against her. Her breathing was soft and quiet, but her fingers stopped their trek and she could feel on her chest where Rio's expression shifted, even if she couldn't see it. Once more, she relaxed.</p><p>For once, Agatha had been the one to call Rio out, and it had clearly caught Rio off guard.</p><p><i>"What's important to me..."</i> Rio began, her touch picking up again as though it had never stopped. <i>"Is that any time we tangle, be it a meal or be it sex or be it what whatever else we've been doing could be called... when we untangle, you feel better than you did before we began."</i></p><p>The moment the words hit Agatha's ears, she hadn't really heard them. So she replayed them. Not once, but twice, and then the processing began. She began to pick those words apart, to dissect them and deconstruct them in an attempt to understand that they were meant as they were stated and nothing else.</p><p>It was an incredibly profound answer, one that actually began to shake who Agatha was at her core. She really thought about it; Rio's goal the day they had met was to care for Agatha in a way that would have helped her heal. The day Agatha had pulled her back from the street, her goal had been to turn Agatha into a friend. That goal had shifted scope several times that day; it had skipped from wanting Agatha has a friend to wanting to spend time with her over coffee Rio now knew she didn't even drink while they delved deeper. That had quickly jumped right into a need for alcohol and closeness, which had wound up in them physically tangled. Rio's goal since had been to just spend time with Agatha, even if her work had been making it difficult. All of those goals were working toward one thing: Rio just wanted to make Agatha happy.</p><p>Rio had to know. She had to be aware that while Agatha was not <i>unhappy,</i> there were not many things in her life that made her <i>happy</i> either. She was in a different set of greys, herself. Rio knew, and that was why she had just whispered such an astounding statement in a breath over the skin of Agatha's chest, right above her heart.</p><p><i>"And why is that?"</i> Agatha finally managed through a bone-dry mouth.</p><p><i>"Because even if you're not ready to like it yet, I care about you. Not just tending to your wounds or making sure you're physically okay, but I care about the you who had to deal with trauma on a day when you were already coping with other trauma."</i> Rio's hand flattened, her palm pressed to Agatha's ribs as her thumb brushed at the underside of Agatha's breast. <i>"I care about the you who sat hunched over your desk and wrote poems about me when I didn't speak to you for two weeks. I care about the you who has clearly never had a working relationship in your life because of how guarded you are. I care about the you who is currently panicking at my use of the word 'relationship,' because I can hear your heart beating a little faster." </i></p><p>Rio paused, taking a soft breath before she continued. <i>"But I also care about you enough to qualify that with a lack of any expectations in that regard. We are both old enough for me to lay right here and tell you that even if you're not ready to be in a relationship, that doesn't mean this has to change. I don't want you to put undue pressure on yourself and give yourself reason to doubt that my affection for you is genuine. It is also steadfast and will stay that way whether or not you're ready for any form of commitment."</i></p><p>Slowly, Rio's head began to shift, tilting back so that she could see Agatha a little better, though the way her head was resting on the pillow didn't allow for much of a view of her face past her chin. <i>"You've traveled, probably more than you've already told me, and what <b>that </b>tells me is that complacency and stillness are not things that are commonplace for you. And I'm here to tell you that's okay. But... If you do make the choice to leave, just tell me first, okay?"</i></p><p>It was for the best that Rio could not see Agatha's expression, but especially her eyes, which were filled with the tears that were leaking out of the corners of them and dampening her hair in the cool air. She was quiet for a long time, but the way her throat would occasionally shift as it tightened each time she tried to speak gave away she was still awake. Rio said nothing else, though, handing the floor to Agatha. If she said something, if she acknowledged that? Great. If she didn't? Well, Rio had still voiced nothing but her own truth and Agatha could do with that whatever it was she wanted.</p><p><i>"I... I will... I will tell you,"</i> was all Agatha managed after far too long.</p><p>Rio did not shrink, she did not shift in any way that told Agatha she was upset or hurt by those words. Rio understood Agatha, and Agatha was relying on that perhaps a bit too much in those moments when she simply wasn't able to find the right words.</p><p>What she wanted to say was how dumbfounded she was that she was a literal professor of English at a highly accredited university and yet, when it came to talking about the really important things, she seemed to be attending a lecture spearheaded by Rio every single time.</p><p>Rio was articulate in this way that was mindblowing to Agatha. Agatha knew how to speak, how to use her words to say what she meant and more, but when had that ever been the case with Rio? Rio seemed to out-speak her every single time, seemed to find the exact right combination of words that left Agatha feeling like she hardly knew any language, any words, that could aid in a suitable reply to the things Rio was consistently telling her.</p><p>
<i>"Thank you. It really does mean a lot."</i>
</p><p>Those were the last words to hit the air in the early morning darkness that surrounded them before the two of them fell asleep within minutes of each other. The day had been long, they had been through more than either of them had thought the night would hold, and Agatha knew she was falling asleep in the hold of someone who genuinely did give a shit about her.</p><p>There was comfort to be found in that.</p><p>When Agatha opened her eyes the next morning, she was immediately aware that Rio was not against her anymore. It was sort-of light outside, but landed somewhere around six or seven in the morning. As her eyes tore from the ceiling, she also became aware that there was still weight on the bed next to her.</p><p>The moment Agatha saw her, she couldn't fight the smile that painted itself across her face.</p><p>Cross-legged and with the three blankets over her lap and the extra over her shoulders, Rio sat with a jar of peanut butter, a butter knife, and a pack of crackers in front of her. Agatha remained quiet, just watching as Rio methodically stuck the knife in the jar and secured a swipe of peanut butter before smearing it onto the buttery cracker.</p><p>As she popped it into her mouth and began to make another while she chewed, Agatha couldn't help but breathe a sleepy laugh.</p><p>Rio's head jerked to the side a little, a sheepish grin coming to pressed lips that offered containment to a full mouth. As she swallowed the bite, she held up a cracker and the peanut butter covered knife.</p><p>"Want some?" she asked, as if Agatha had not literally just woken up.</p><p><i>"Do I want some of my own food immediately after opening my eyes? No, I am okay, thank you,"</i> Agatha returned, though the smile on her face hardly dimmed.</p><p>Rio shrugged and turned back to her task of fixing herself another cracker.</p><p>"By the way... you do know tomorrow is Christmas, right?" Rio questioned right before she took only a bite of that cracker, which took her less time to chew and let her continue a little faster. "And you don't have a single decoration up."</p><p>At this, Agatha scoffed.</p><p>"I'm not ever in the holiday spirit. Plus, you call that little Charlie Brown tree you have on the second floor 'Christmas Decorations?'" she returned, though her tone wasn't sharp, it was merely teasing.</p><p>"Yeah, well. I'm not home much. And most years I spend Christmas at the hospital, anyway, and that place is decorated to the nines every single year." Rio tossed in the other half of the cracker and chewed thoughtfully, her lips twisting for a moment before she turned her head to look at Agatha, pinning her in that way that clearly expressed she was about to ask one of her asinine questions.</p><p>"What do you want for Christmas, Agatha?"</p><p>Agatha could have answered with any well-thought-out and likely sarcastic answer. She could have answered with literally <i>anything </i>and she knew Rio would have accepted it, but what she chose instead was deliberate.</p><p>It was intentional.</p><p>
<i>"What I want for Christmas this year, Rio, is to be with you."</i>
</p><p>Agatha could see it, the way Rio wanted to point out so badly that they were sort of stuck together in that regard, but she could then see the realization that Agatha wasn't referring to that as it washed over her face.</p><p><i>"Do you mean that?"</i> Rio asked quietly, but she didn't move. She was completely still, hunched over with that butter knife still clutched in her hand. She was this picture of uncomplicated and unbothered peace, a steadfast ship on a stormy sea. Even in the mundane could Rio still be so... perfect.</p><p>Agatha didn't want anyone else to see that. She wanted that vision to be only hers.</p><p>
<i>"I do. I think I'm really tired of running."</i>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Time had stopped.</p><p>There were no sounds, not even of soft breaths in the cold room.</p><p>Agatha was holding hers because she was in a state of shocked disbelief that she'd just admitted something so fucking loaded in the early hours of the morning.</p><p>Rio was holding hers because she was in a state of shocked disbelief that Agatha had just admitted something so fucking loaded in the early hours of the morning.</p><p>As their eyes met, Agatha could see it as it flickered in and out of Rio's dark pools: blind hope.</p><p>They both seemed frozen, right along with the progression of time. They were stuck in that odd rut of having reached the peak only to tumble into the ravine below. They were in it, and it was Agatha's doing. Because of it, she didn't have to question why Rio was so stunned. She had surely not expected to show up in the middle of a snow storm and them somehow work through at least some of Agatha's layered barriers.</p><p>Agatha could have said the same thing; she had been convinced that she knew what she was offering Rio when she had extended the invitation of somewhere safe to stay. Maybe it hadn't been unfounded, but she had not realized just how much of herself she would end up giving over as a result of their proximity.</p><p>She should have known better. Things were never so cut and dry when it came to Rio. Nothing about their interactions was ever so black and white and there was this undeniable gradient of greys that had come to fall between them. It wasn't just something Rio had brought with her into this entanglement, but something Agatha had been unknowingly carrying as well.</p><p>The longer the silence wore on, the more uneasy Agatha felt herself becoming. She wanted Rio to say something, to acknowledge that she'd just made a very bold statement in regards to the things she wanted in her life. She wanted Rio to understand what that had taken out of her and how the silence she was offering in those moments was unnerving her.</p><p>In what felt like slow-motion, Rio turned her head forward and set about stowing the food and relocating it to the nightstand beside the bed. When she completed the task, she reached up to remove the blanket from around her shoulders and for a split second, Agatha began to panic. Was she really going to leave it like that? Was Rio really going to navigate around something so large without slamming into it?</p><p>Rio dropped the extra blanket off the edge of the bed and shifted atop the mattress in a way that allowed her to slide under the three blankets that had been on her lap. She placed herself flat on her back, her arm running the length of Agatha's, skin-to-skin until Rio was able to hook her fingers through Agatha's from behind.</p><p>Before Agatha could panic any longer, those smooth and soft tones filled her ears, almost instantly slowing down the hammering in her chest at the idea that Rio might just let it lie where it had been.</p><p><i>"I want to tell you something. And I want to preface it with... I wasn't going to tell you today. Or even while I was still here, however long that might be. But... I need you to know that's only because I did not want to pressure you into what you just chose to do on your own." </i>Rio's head turned on the pillow beneath her, gaze landing on Agatha's profile.</p><p>Agatha wasn't ready to look at her.</p><p>Agatha was still trying to understand what was happening. Rio had pointed it out, though. Agatha had made a <i>choice.</i> Agatha had made a decision that impacted both of their lives, and she was handing over a great deal of trust to Rio who could easily run her straight into the ground with it. That had never really been Rio's style, had it?</p><p>
<i>"I submitted for the peds transfer again. And this time, I'm not canceling it." </i>
</p><p>Slowly, Agatha's head rolled to the side so that she found herself eye-to-eye with Rio across the small waves of fabric and pillows. As the statement pinged from wall to wall on the inside of Agatha's mind, she was trying to understand it. They'd talked about this before. Rio had turned it down because she knew where she was meant to be. So what had changed?</p><p>Agatha's brows knit together, pinching tightly above her nose as she searched for the best way to phrase what she needed to ask.</p><p><i>"Did you do that because it's something you want to do, or because it's something you need to do?" </i>Agatha whispered, her blue eyes darting over Rio's face in the light of an overcast morning as it poured in through the windows.</p><p>Rio seemed to consider this for a moment, only slightly caught off guard this time that Agatha seemed to be finding her voice a bit more, and using it appropriately. Her lips worried against one another while she thought it out, while she tried to place her motive before she voiced it.</p><p><i>"Can it be both?"</i> Rio returned, their eyes locking again.</p><p>
<i>"Can I have some elaboration? I'm still floundering a little over here..."</i>
</p><p>The soft sound of a chuckle came from beside Agatha on that bed only a second before Rio was suddenly moving, shifting to her side, then to loom over Agatha, soft locks of hair tumbling over her shoulder to tickle at the skin of Agatha's chest. It made Agatha shift slightly in some half-assed attempt to get away from the contact, but the warmth it provided was something she actually liked, even if she'd keep that to herself.</p><p>Agatha had assumed that with such a move, Rio would immediately provide a response. Instead, what she had to say didn't vibrate either of her vocal chords. Her hand lifted silently and her index finger hooked under Agatha's chin. Her thumb pressed lightly into the fleshy part of it to establish the lightest grip there. Once it was secured, Rio's head dropped and more of her hair graced Agatha's skin, but a bit too heavy to tickle. It was barely even a thought before Rio kissed her.</p><p>It wasn't that Rio kissed her. It was that Rio pulled down slightly on Agatha's chin, enough to part her lips, and then folded her own over Agatha's top one. It was the millimetres of separation before she kissed the bottom lip in the same way. It was the way Agatha let herself be kissed like that because she was feeling every shout such a move had to offer.</p><p>After a moment, Rio lifted her head back and settled a bit more on her side, letting her hand drop from Agatha's chin but only to rest on her chest. Her head dropped back to the pillow and her fingertips traced the tiniest shapes over Agatha's skin.</p><p>
<i>"I <b>wanted </b>to do it because I can't take the weight of an unpredictable schedule. Will there still be emergencies in peds? Of course. But... not eighty percent of my scheduled shifts and ninety percent of my unscheduled ones. However... I <b>needed </b>to do it to prove to myself, and to you, that I'm capable of change, too."</i>
</p><p>Agatha was hit again, almost dead center in her gut. Agatha had never asked Rio to put up or shut up, but it was mostly because she'd never needed to. Rio had always been forward with her intentions, sometimes annoyingly so. Rio was announcing without a thought to be had that she could recognize Agatha's efforts and meet them with her own.</p><p>Agatha found herself asking that unanswered question once more, even internally:</p><p>Who the hell was Rio Vidal?</p><p>Who the hell was this woman <i>so fucking filled</i> with compassion and understanding? Who was this woman that was <i>so wholly</i> dedicated to constant growth in who she was as a person? Who was this human being who could see so plainly what other people were willing to overlook?</p><p>And how the hell had Agatha Harkness wound up in a relationship with her?</p><p><i>"You don't owe me anything, Rio," </i> Agatha tried to assert, but it simply caused Rio to press a heavier fingertip into Agatha's sternum.</p><p><i>"You're right, Agatha. I don't <b>owe</b> you anything. I'm not in debt to you. I am choosing to provide the things I think might be useful to you. Right now, I have decided that my time and availability are two things that could prove useful." </i>Rio's cadence was so damn measured that it was almost impossible not to be lulled into some snug sense of security at the things she was saying.</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a long few moments, just watching Rio, her dark honey eyes fixated on her own hand as she gave Agatha the time to process while not under a scrutinous gaze.</p><p><i>"Rio," </i>Agatha breathed, turning her head in a way that left the tips of their noses only a couple of inches away from each other. Rio's brows hiked in silent encouragement and it worked as Agatha began to speak again. <i>"Thank you for telling me. And... thank you for being wise with your timing and not ambushing me."</i></p><p>Although she wasn't exactly suddenly wealthy in her ability to speak about sensitive matters, Agatha was making a very active effort to stop sitting around with a dumbstruck look on her face while Rio continuously poured her heart out time and time again.</p><p>Rio shifted again, leaning over Agatha in a way that allowed her to steal a soft kiss before she settled the weight of her torso atop Agatha's. Even though the kiss ended, Rio did not move. Instead, her eyes flickered open and she was gazing down at Agatha with a calm but thoughtful look written over her beautiful and gentle features.</p><p>There was this tender scrutiny in Rio's eyes as she just studied Agatha, sliding beneath a layer at a time the longer she seemed to stare. Then, a very classic Rio smirk curled up her lips.</p><p><i>"So... does it feel different?"</i> she crooned, her head tipping to the left in playful interrogation.</p><p>Not understanding, Agatha's expression puckered slightly, but the moment she opened her mouth to request clarification, it dawned on her what Rio was actually asking.</p><p><i>"No, Rio, being officially in a relationship does not feel any different,"</i> Agatha responded, though her tone did not hold as much monotony as she had tried to feign. She did not look away from Rio's gaze, though, and instead turned the question back on her. <i>"Does it feel different to you?"</i></p><p>
<i>"Yes, but it's not the actual being in one that feels different. It's the emotional weight of you allowing me to have that position and privilege in your life that feels different."</i>
</p><p>Agatha's jaw hinged slightly and her mouth fell open. She was dumbstruck to silence once again because Rio seemed to know exactly the right fucking thing to say. Didn't she always?</p><p>It was effortless for Rio, it seemed, to just jump right into the deep end without a single care for her own safety. Didn't she know what she was signing herself up for? Didn't she realize that this invitation into a very untouched facet of Agatha's life could bring with it dangers and perils that came from a path that had not been ventured down in decades? Couldn't she see that she was starting a fire mere yards away from a fuel tank?</p><p>Looking at Rio right then, Agatha genuinely had to wonder if Rio would have even cared if the answer to all three of those questions was a simple 'yes.'</p><p><i>"You do realize that it doesn't change much else, right?" </i>Agatha attempted in a hard tone, but it fell a little flat in her delivery.</p><p><i>"Of course I realize that, Agatha. You're still the captain of this ship and you're steering where it may go. Your commitment is not contingent on your lack of control." </i>There was the quickest flash in Rio's eyes. It was light, it was playful, it was... mischievous. <i>"I dare to say it might have even afforded you more than you realize."</i></p><p>This caught Agatha's attention in a hypercritical way. She wanted to probe, wanted to push harder and determine what that meant, exactly, but they were still snowed into that townhome and they had nowhere else to go to escape. She wanted to know the implications of such a statement but then realized that she might have some time yet to get it figured out.</p><p>Rio dipped her head again to garner another kiss, something she was likely going to be heavy handed in doing now that Agatha had forked over the smallest modicum of permission.</p><p>"I'm going to go grab us some waters. Is there anything you'd like me to get you to eat?" Rio's request was so light and so kind, it was a genuine offer of wanting to provide. Acts of service, it seemed, was one of Rio's love languages. Allowing herself to accept that for what it was, Agatha realized, was another step she was taking in trying to form a mutual appreciation and duty of care.</p><p>Agatha could still be struggling in trying to see what Rio saw when she looked at Agatha, but Agatha knew without question what it was in Rio that kept her rooted where she was.</p><p>Rio was unlike anyone Agatha had met in her entire life. Rio was someone who had dedicated years of her life toward working in a field that had its own emotional strain on top of any physical workload. Rio was someone who paid close attention to any and all situations she placed herself in. Rio had this hyperacuity about her that allowed her to pin the most minute instances and pick them apart for the sake of progression.</p><p>Rio had still been lonely. Rio had been so lonely that she had put her career on the line to see to it that the two of them inevitably wound up exactly where they were.</p><p>"If you wanted to grab me a granola bar, the chocolate and peanut butter ones are my favorite," Agatha informed her, leaning up to place her lips to the meat of Rio's cheek. It was almost too sweet of a gesture, but Agatha still wanted to find a way to show her gratitude.</p><p>Rio hesitated only a moment while she beheld the woman below her before she pushed herself up and rolled out of the bed to wrap herself up in the blanket she had previously discarded to the floor at the side of the bed.</p><p>Watching Rio as she seemed to glide right out that bedroom door, Agatha was throttled into a moment of severe self-contemplation.</p><p>She had lied to Rio.</p><p>She had given herself over in the form of declaring exclusivity and her first act in that new commitment was to lie.</p><p>The truth was, <i>it did feel different.</i></p><p>It didn't feel the same to be laying there with Rio with the new premise that she was no longer allowed to consider bolting as a first option. It didn't feel the same to look at the new light in Rio's eyes each time the other woman saw her. It didn't feel the same to recognize that she was the cause of the blush on Rio's neck and cheeks.</p><p>It felt different to admit attachment, even to herself because she wasn't ready to tell Rio that much, yet.</p><p>It felt different to let herself have the thought <i>'I don't want to give her the chance to feel the way she feels for me... for someone else. I want it to keep being me.'</i></p><p>Agatha was being selfish in a different vein and while the attempts were quiet, she let herself flesh it out throughout the course of their day. She had let herself lay in bed eating a granola bar while she talked about books and media with Rio between mouthfuls of crackers and peanut butter. She let herself get lost in how soft Rio's hair was between her fingers as they snuggled for warmth.</p><p>She had even let Rio give her endless shit about her lack of Christmas cheer well into the dark hours of the evening.</p><p>During that round of teasing, Rio's fixation had wound up on mistletoe.</p><p>"You don't have <i>any</i> mistletoe at all?"</p><p>"Rio, why would I have random mistletoe laying around any other time of the year if I have no use for it on Christmas?" Agatha shot pointedly as she quirked a brow in question.</p><p>Rio, who was sitting slightly in front of Agatha and to her right, simply shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>"Haven't you ever wanted to be kissed under the mistletoe? It's like... Christmas tradition!" The exuberance in Rio's tone was almost shocking, but Agatha knew better. There were very few things Rio chose to get excited about, so either this was one of those things or she was having one hell of a time running Agatha over the coals for it.</p><p>"Can't say that I have," Agatha responded with a light shrug of her blanket-covered shoulders.</p><p>"Well," Rio started, leaning over to swipe her phone off of the nightstand. She waited for a moment as it powered back on, a move she had surely made to preserve the battery life without access to electricity. Smart. Respectable. The moment she had it open, though, Rio was speaking again. "Would you kiss <i>me</i> under the mistletoe?"</p><p>This actually caused Agatha to grin. It was a real wide and toothy grin that was accompanied by the breathiest shake of laughter.</p><p>"Yes, Rio, if somehow magical mistletoe happened to appear, I would oblige you with a kiss beneath it."</p><p>Rio's grin happened instantly and it was infinitely brighter than the one Agatha had just been sporting. Her eyes lifted from her phone and landed directly into Agatha's own blue ones. Without saying a word, Rio lifted her phone and flipped her hand to show Agatha the screen.</p><p>On it was a full-screen photo of a mistletoe plant.</p><p>Oh, she was <i>good.</i></p><p>Agatha's eyes lifted back to Rio and she raised her shoulders, keeping them pinned to her neck for a few moments in mock surrender.</p><p>"You have bested me, what can I say?" The corners of Agatha's eyes wrinkled with just how far her cheeks pushed up as a result of her smile.</p><p>"You don't have to say anything at all," Rio returned, lifting the phone up to hold it over Agatha's head. She hesitated for a few seconds to see if Agatha was going to resist, but when she chose to be passive, Rio took exactly what she wanted.</p><p>She leaned forward and their lips met fully, warmly. It wasn't timid by any means, but it was a gauge, a test of what the new confines of their recently established relationship might hold. Once Rio seemed to realize that literally nothing else had changed outside of the title, the heat began to creep in. By the time one of her hands had landed on Agatha's face, Agatha's own reached up to pluck the phone out of Rio's raised grip, tossing it down the bed a bit carelessly, thankful that it didn't bounce and fall off.</p><p>Instead of the phone, Agatha filled Rio's palm with her own, linking their fingers together before she brought their arms down. The longer they touched, the longer they kissed, the higher the temperature climbed into the room, or at least it felt that way.</p><p>It had taken a total of four minutes for what had started as a sweet gesture to completely devolve in Agatha hopping right back into the driver's seat. She was kissing and ravishing and devouring whatever bit of Rio she would fork over. She was tugging on hair, sinking her fingertips deep into muscle. She was nibbling on Rio's flesh as much as she was allowed without making a visible show.</p><p>It had taken almost the same amount of time for Agatha to make the decision to slide off the bed, bend Rio over the edge of it and drop to her knees behind her.</p><p>That had been the first orgasm Agatha had plucked from between Rio's legs, but it hadn't been the last of the evening. In fact, by the time Rio collapsed on top of her, spent and heaving, Agatha had mentally tallied four altogether and felt pretty damn satisfied with herself. There would be more time for exploring when they weren't trapped due to inclement weather, sure, but for the time being, Agatha was pleased with just how exhausted Rio seemed to be.</p><p>It had even caused Agatha to breathe the quietest giggle when she had wound her hand around the back of Rio's thigh but was immediately met with a whine of protest that almost sounded pathetic. Instead, she had nuzzled against the top of Rio's head and adjusted the blanket over her bare back.</p><p>Rio had fallen asleep with ease.</p><p>Agatha had not.</p><p>In fact, at least two hours had passed since the exact moment Rio had slipped into slumber on top of Agatha's body, her head tucked under Agatha's chin. It had been less than twenty minutes since she had tried to move and slid right off of Agatha's chest and landed crookedly on her side to the right of Agatha.</p><p>Agatha had just watched her in the dark, a little disgruntled that the power still had not come back on. It would have still been dark in the room, but it would have granted the access to even the little lamp on the desk not too far from the bed.</p><p>At the thought, she looked over at it.</p><p>The longer she stared at the dark wood and the mess of pale papers atop it, the longer she felt something beginning to bubble inside of her. It felt like a simmer at first, but the longer she laid there looking at that desk, the more it began to morph into a rolling boil.</p><p>It took another five minutes before Agatha was carefully sliding out of bed. Padding out into the hall, she pulled a candle from the closet and paced back to the bedroom, heading right for the desk. She opened the little drawer in the front and felt around for the matchbook she knew to be inside. Once she had it, she didn't waste a second in lighting the candle. She placed it next to the lamp that was currently not working, hoping for the same soft illumination based on location.</p><p>It worked.</p><p>Agatha placed herself in the chair and secured the pen in her fingers, tilting her head forward to look down at the empty leaf of paper before her.</p><p>Her lips twisted in silent contemplation as she tried to decide what she wanted to do. She could try her hand at a poem, but hadn't she done as much already? It had told Rio enough, but it hadn't really mentioned the important things. It hadn't included the details of the minutia and had been rather nondescript in the reality of it.</p><p>Every time Agatha would raise her hand and poise the pen above the upper left corner of the paper, she would freeze. It was a cycle repeating for a good ten minutes before Agatha had finally had enough of herself.</p><p>She would write it. If she hated it, she'd stick it in the flame and burn it up. She'd keep writing until she got it right, if she had to.</p><p>She had crumpled up four sheets of paper and had ripped two over the course of forty five minutes. With an additional twenty, though, she was staring down at something she committed herself to not destroying. Her eyes darted over the first page, and then the second. Was it too much? Was it not enough?</p><p>Wasn't there only one way to find out?</p><p>Agatha lifted it off the desk and let herself read over it one last time.</p><p>
<i>Rio -</i>
</p><p>
<i>It has struck me quite violently several times in the process of trying to write you this that this might not be so difficult if I could garner anywhere near enough courage to just speak to you instead of scribbling these words on a page that I can hardly see. I don't even actually know if you will be able to decipher this. If you can and don't like the message that may end up conveyed, you can just pretend like the chicken scratch I am in possession of was too chaotic for consumption.</i>
</p><p>
<i>So, we instead venture forth into the purpose of why I am writing this.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I am penning these words outside of what I am comfortable in because if you can choose to consistently make concessions for me, I feel it is only fair that there be a sense of reciprocity. Here I sit at some obnoxious hour of the morning trying to reciprocate even a fraction of the things you have offered me in the last several weeks of knowing you by doing what I can to actually just... talk to you.</i>
</p><p>
<i>There are times when you are deep in thought, times when you are traversing the caverns of your mind, that I almost ask you what it is that has you there, what cements you there in those moments. The truth is, however, that I am far too nervous for whatever honest answer you might be too eager to provide. I am too afraid that you are going to voice a thought I have not been able to prepare myself to hear and as a result, I am nervous at what type of reaction that may elicit from me.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I told you that I would relay to you if I felt the need to leave. I meant it, but what I was unable to add to that was that I... Really hope I don't. Need to leave, I mean. I cannot make definitive promises. I cannot look you in the eye and tell you that I will be different, or better tomorrow. Or the next day.</i>
</p><p>
<i>What I <u>can</u> do is tell you that I will always try to be. I will always try to find at least one way throughout a day to show you the importance I feel when it pertains to having you around. Your quips and consistent emotional deep-dives are hard for me to digest because they are so impossibly foreign to me, but it does not mean I am not putting forth any effort. I am, truly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I am not incapable of emotion, and I hope you recognize that. I hope you also see that you inspire me to create change, even if it's in the smallest ways right now. I hope you understand that you have that power over me because of who you are, how you feel about me, and how you make me feel about the world at large.</i>
</p><p>
<i>You took a risk on me that night in the hospital by throwing your phone on my bed. I'm taking a risk on you by choosing to let myself understand the gravity of what a relationship with someone as... complex as you can entail. I am of the utter understanding that I am giving you access to the very things that can cripple me if you ever choose to use them maliciously. I am also comprehensive of the fact that I am choosing to give them to you because you are not capable of making such a decision.</i>
</p><p>
<i>That is because you, Rio, are more than just a healer as it relates solely to your job. You are a healer in the essence of your very being. You deliver color to a grey world to heal the drab and impartial. You smile at anyone who meets your eye to offer a brief balm over an unknown soul. As it relates directly to me, you wield your tenderness and compassion in a way that allows you to channel it through touch. You touch me and I can almost feel the mending. It is more than a slow going process, but the fact that it has become a process at all is far more significant than you might have ever surmised without the indication I am providing here.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I find it hard to speak most times when you are so willing to dive deeply into your feelings. I'm still having those feelings, but in their newness, it still feels like such a feat to find a way to vocalize them.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It is my hope that this letter can somehow supplement for my failure to be verbally articulate. It is my hope that when you read this, you can imagine in that beautiful mind of yours what it would sound like if I were able to read these words off of this page and directly into your ear. It is my hope that you understand that even though I cannot always tell you the things I am thinking, it does not mean I am not thinking them.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I'm thinking, always, and more often than not, it is about you. It is about the woman who challenges me consistently but with the intention of facilitating growth. It is about the riddle of a woman who spends over half of her life in the chaotic act of balancing life and death and yet still makes time to find balance within me. It is about that same woman who lives in a house that is too big for her with a slice of life tucked within the walls of an indoor greenhouse. It is about the idea that you have wealth, yet money actually means very little to you. It is about the idea that you have a variety of things you could be choosing to do with the little time you have outside of work and yet, you appear to choose me each time.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I have far too many thoughts in a day about you, Rio, and the idea that I will ever be able to tell you them in the immediate future is still a wily one.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Even if I lack that ability, please know that they're still there, circling laps around my mind.</i>
</p><p>
<i>You consume me, most days, even when you are physically absent.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The Christmas gift I can offer you at this point in time is the sincere promise that I am not afraid of that anymore.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Sincerely,<br/>
-Agatha.</i>
</p><p>As she finished reading, Agatha did not waste a moment in taking to the task of folding it into three sections. If she waited any longer, she was going to ball it up and toss it in the trash. As she looked up from her work, she glanced to the window to see that the sun had already started its climb into the day.</p><p>Agatha pressed the folded paper down to the desk and scribed a neat 'Merry Christmas' across the blank sliver of page. She got to her feet and leaned over to blow out the candle before she moved to gingerly place the folded papers atop her pillow for Rio to see when she awoke.</p><p>She stared at it for a long moment before she compelled herself to move. She made her way to the closet and pulled on a sweatshirt and a pair of spandex shorts she pulled out of the top drawer of her shorter dresser.</p><p>As she turned toward the door, Agatha's eyes lingered on Rio for just a moment and she was caught in a new wave of indecision. She felt this tugging, this draw toward the woman in that bed, to show her affection even though she was not awake to bask in it. Soft footsteps carried Agatha over to Rio's side of the bed and she reached down, pulling the blanket a little higher up Rio's back to ensure she would stay warm.</p><p>Agatha willed her feet to move, but they wouldn't. She couldn't relocate because her body was trying to inform her that her task was not yet complete. The panic welled but the choked it back down, swallowing hard to establish a physical show of such a feat.</p><p>Somewhere in the next few breaths Agatha took, she understood what was holding her there.</p><p>Slowly, she leaned over the edge of the bed, craning just enough so that she could place her lips softly to the crown of Rio's head. It was the lightest kiss, barely enough contact to constitute it as one, but it was one nonetheless. As she straightened back to full height, Agatha found her ability to shift, to pick up her feet in a way that allowed them to carry her downstairs.</p><p>She had snagged the copy of The Wild Fox of Yemen that had been laying on the corner of her desk and paced into the kitchen to grab a bag of dried cherries and a bottle of water. Once she had acquired the necessities to wait out another day -- Christmas day -- of being trapped inside, Agatha had posted up on the couch in the living room and set to reading.</p><p>She'd been absorbed in the pages for a long while, occasionally popping a pinch of the dried fruit into her mouth absentmindedly. By the time she reached the last quarter of the book, Agatha had been pulled from her reading by the sound of creaking coming from the stairs.</p><p>As Agatha was completely unaware of what was about to happen given the weight that had been left upon her pillow, she made the decision to not look up from her book, at least at first. The moment Rio landed on the ground floor, though, that was out the window.</p><p>Agatha's eyes lifted and the smallest but sweetest smile tugged on the corners of her mouth.</p><p>"Good morning," she greeted, though her eyes had not left the still naked Rio who was deliberately pacing straight toward her.</p><p>The moment Rio was in front of her, she was also reaching down to pluck the book out of Agatha's lap and was quick to place it on the arm of the couch. The moment Agatha seemed to catch on, she moved the bag of cherries, too. As they dropped to the floor in front of the couch, there was a sudden beep that sounded from the kitchen and the lights around them flickered back to life after days of being dark.</p><p>This did not phase Rio in the slightest.</p><p>Instead, she pulled back the blanket on Agatha's lap and replaced it with the weight of her own bare body. The way she curled into Agatha struck her somewhere dangerously close to her heart. Her legs were pulled up, her forehead was pressed to the side of Agatha's neck and the demand there was silent but completely clear.</p><p>Rio needed to be held.</p><p>Agatha's internal question was then: Why did Rio need to be held?</p><p>In the next moment, she realized that the answer had no bearing on what she would choose to do.</p><p>Agatha raised her arms and secured them around Rio's form, only releasing for a moment to pull a blanket over her nude body to the best of her abilities.</p><p>There they'd sat, Rio secure in Agatha's arms like a small child, as the heater had kicked on and began to warm the house once more.</p><p>They'd sat through five minutes, then fifteen. Twenty minutes in, there was movement.</p><p>Rio's head twisted slightly inward and her lips graced the skin over Agatha's collarbone. This caused Agatha's eyes to slide shut, a soft breath passing quickly through parted lips. She let it happen, though. She even offered no protest at the way Rio's lips began to travel.</p><p>Rio shifted, then, and the kisses trekked further still. She positioned herself in a way that allowed her to easily place more of them across defining points on Agatha's face from her cheeks to her temples to the small space between her eyebrows to the length of her nose. At the kiss Rio placed to the tip of it, Agatha squirmed slightly beneath her.</p><p><i>"Rio..."</i> she whispered in a tone that sounded way more strangled than she had been intending.</p><p><i>"Yes?"</i> came warm breath on the skin of Agatha's forehead.</p><p>
<i>"What are you doing?"</i>
</p><p>There was a couple of beats of silence, Rio's mouth still hovering close enough to Agatha's face that her breath was more warming than the job the heater was doing to warm the house back up.</p><p>
<i>"You made the decision to use your words. I am making the decision to use my actions this time as I form a response to the gift I was left."</i>
</p><p>Rio's lips resumed their work in the way they peppered more kisses across Agatha's features. The moment that they met Agatha's own lips full on, though, brought with it a form of panic, one that only became louder with the way Rio's hand slid beneath her shirt. Immediately, Agatha's posture stiffened.</p><p><i>"Rio... I... I can't..." </i>she stammered weakly against Rio's lips.</p><p>Rio did not retract, did not pull away, did not get upset. Instead, her hand withdrew from Agatha's skin and her arm wedged between the couch cushion and Agatha's back, holding her close. They remained situated like that for several long moments, but just as Agatha had begun to question where they were supposed to go from there, Rio spoke instead.</p><p>
<i>"I respect your choice, but... It would make me feel better if you would at least let me kiss your bruises before I am faced with a reality of not knowing if I will get the chance to before they are gone."</i>
</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Agatha had completely dissolved. She was nothing more than a puddle of emotion at the idea that instead of bristling at the refusal of sex, Rio had risen to the occasion, as she always did, and submitted a request for something else, for something more. She didn't want to <i>cause </i>more bruises. She didn't want to work Agatha up to the point of needing the physical release sex could offer.</p><p>All Rio wanted was to shower her in affection she was convinced Agatha had never known.</p><p>
<i>"Okay."</i>
</p><p>With permission offered, Rio shifted to help Agatha remove her shirt and leaned in to steal a quaint kiss. Once it was off, Rio gave a gentle tip of her chin to indicate that she wanted Agatha to lay down.</p><p>This felt oddly familiar, but Agatha did as was requested of her and laid back onto the expanse of the couch, her eyes following Rio's every fluid movement as she placed herself above Agatha's knees. It took no time for her to fold, for her lips to seek out every blemish they could find and heal. She spent the next twenty minutes like that, just dusting the entirety of Agatha's torso with pure and intentional kisses. She kissed at the hickeys, she kissed at the bruises. Rio paid special attention to the two bite marks, too.</p><p>The longer Rio continued, the more she had felt the need to busy her hands, as well. One of them had started on Agatha's hip and ventured down toward her thigh, fingers pressing and kneading and pulling. It was a lover's touch, a gentle caress fueled by a dire need for physical closeness.</p><p>Her fingers had curled barely toward the inside of Agatha's thigh at the exact same moment that she had placed a kiss to a light bruise almost directly in the center of Agatha's sternum. In the next second, Rio could immediately feel every single muscle in Agatha's body as it pulled taut and she sucked in a breath that she did not exhale.</p><p>Seconds passed and although Rio had stilled as well, there was a wild light sparkling in her eyes the moment Agatha exhaled the breath she was holding onto.</p><p><i>"Agatha..."</i> Rio voiced in wonder, looking up at the other woman from beneath her lashes. <i>"Did you just..."</i></p><p>In a sudden flurry of movement, Agatha's hands both raised and covered the glimpse of an embarrassed smile and red flushed cheeks that had happened at Rio's soft prodding.</p><p><i>"I have been told I am a freak for that many times,"</i> Agatha managed in a muffled murmur,<i> "and most of those times, I have not given a shit. But... right now, I feel like a freak."</i></p><p>Rio shifted, placing herself atop Agatha in a way that still allowed for her to move Agatha's hands away from her face. Agatha found herself staring up at the other woman, her cheeks still red, and in that moment, she truly felt like someone in the world saw her. That was only proven further by the way Rio kissed her, and by the way they proceeded to spend the next hour -- at minimum -- just pressed skin to skin in an embrace as the temperature in the home continued to climb.</p><p>At some point, Agatha had dozed off and when she awoke, it was to a fully clothed Rio who was perched in the chair adjacent to the couch.</p><p><i>"Mmm, hey,"</i> Agatha muttered sleepily, reaching up to wipe at her eyes as she sat up. She realized that she was still only in those spandex shorts, but she didn't care, even when realizing that Rio was fully dressed.</p><p><i>"Hey. Everything's clear enough for me to go home, but I wanted to wait until you woke up so I could tell you goodbye."</i> Rio's voice was so low, as if she were telling Agatha a secret, something she needed to remember to hold onto.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha's half-asleep well of impulsivity almost overflowed, but the question died on her tongue only a moment after it had formed as a thought:</p><p>
<i>Do you have to leave?</i>
</p><p>There had been comfort in the last days they had spent locked in that townhome and Agatha was unsure of what might happen when they were both given time to ruminate in the vastness of it all.</p><p>Before Agatha could even insist that Rio should stay, because it was Christmas, Rio got to her feet and Agatha took that as her cue to follow suit. She lifted herself off of the couch and draped a blanket over her shoulders so that she could walk Rio to the door.</p><p>Rio turned and while Agatha knew what she was going to do, she chose to beat Rio to the punch. Her hand lifted, fingers gliding with ease along Rio's jaw to hook into the give at the corner. It allowed her to bring Rio forward, to kiss her in a way that called upon their parting kisses before, but this time meant so much more.</p><p>As she pulled away, her eyes opened to take in Rio, bundled up in her coat and ready to brave another cold Boston evening.</p><p>"Be safe on your way home and let me know when you get there, okay?" Agatha offered and Rio answered with a grin before she replied verbally.</p><p>"Always and absolutely. You'll be my first contact as soon as I make sure the generator held up and all of my flowers are not dead." Rio's voice was light, but Agatha realized for the first time that the greenhouse had probably been quite a large stressor throughout all of this, but it had never occurred to her that she should ask.</p><p>"I'll talk to you tonight, Rio." With that Agatha stole one last brief peck and took half a step back to allow Rio the room to leave.</p><p>Rio's hand fastened around the doorknob, but before she pulled it open, she released it again and turned back to face Agatha.</p><p>"Look..." Rio voiced, her lips twisting around one another. "I am a staunch believer in telling people how you feel about them when you part ways, simply for the fact that I am all too aware of the things that can happen in the blink of an eye." Rio took a couple of steps toward Agatha but left a small bit of space between them.</p><p>In that moment, Agatha was both clueless and yet still somehow knew what was about to happen. She stayed planted where she was, but her entire focus was on Rio.</p><p>"This world can be fickle, and if I walk out that door without telling you what I have to say and something happens to me, I know that you will live with guilt and pain over it for any duration of time. But if that happens and you were to never hear what I have to say? I fear you may only feel the echoes of a pain that would be over what you now know would be left unsaid."</p><p>Rio made a slow move to take hold of Agatha's hand, pulling it into both of her own as she met Agatha's gaze head-on.</p><p>"Agatha, I love you. And I say that to you <i>knowing</i> full well that you are not going to say it back. I say that to you because I need you to know that I see you, all of you. I say it to you because while I am always going to do what I can to meet you where you are, there are just some things I don't feel should remain unspoken."</p><p>Agatha was fighting to listen to the words Rio was telling her, struggling to understand them in the order in which they had been arranged, but she just kept replaying those first for words over and over again.</p><p>Agatha, I love you.</p><p>Agatha, <i>I love you.</i></p><p>
<i>Agatha, I love you.</i>
</p><p>Rio was still speaking, though, and Agatha actively forced herself to tune back in.</p><p>"So... if that does not scare you, I'd like to request that I retain the ability to say it again and again. Not in excess, of course. But... If you are open to being reminded of it, I will always take the opportunity, when appropriate, to assert it to you, lest you forget."</p><p>Agatha blinked at Rio, completely stunned to utter silence.</p><p><i>"Rio..."</i> Agatha forced out over the texture of sandpaper that had filled her mouth.</p><p>The look on Rio's face as they made eye contact was earnest, but it was also tinged with nerves. The look in those dark honey pools was encouraging. She'd said her peace and now, the mic was in Agatha's hands.</p><p><i>"I... Thank you," </i>she finally settled on.</p><p>Rio's smile did not bring with it even the slightest flicker of dissatisfaction. Instead, she actually looked relieved that she'd received such a response.</p><p>The look that she wore after Agatha then leaned in to take an unassuming kiss was even better, even more tender and taken.</p><p>
<i>"Get a shower, make some tea. You've done a lot in a couple of days. Take care of you and I'll text you the moment I'm home, okay?"</i>
</p><p>The amount of affection that poured out of Rio with every word spoken was enthralling and Agatha knew in that moment just how <i>lucky </i>she was to be the vessel that was receiving such an emotion. She was not sure how to contain it, but that would be a mission for later that evening.</p><p>
<i>"Okay. I'll be waiting to hear from you."</i>
</p><p>Another grin flashed across Rio's lips in the seconds before she leaned toward Agatha to snatch one last lip lock.</p><p>
<i>"I'll talk to you soon, beautiful."</i>
</p><p>With that Rio pulled away, hesitating for only a moment before she turned around and let herself out of the townhouse to start her journey home.</p><p>And all Agatha could do as she stared at the now-closed door was reach up and touch her lips.</p><p>Those were the same lips that had been graced by ones that had produced those four words. Those four words that wouldn't stop ricocheting off of every available surface in Agatha's mind. Those four words that Agatha had convinced herself she would never hear produced by another human being when they were being directed at her.</p><p>
<i>Agatha, I love you.</i>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Admitting it to herself felt like a crime, but it only took three days of consistent back and forth texting for Agatha to realize that she missed Rio. She was aware she still had Rio's attention and probably more of it than she deserved due to Rio's duty to other responsibilities in her life. That wasn't even a move at downplaying herself despite living in her own insecurities.</p><p>Rio was supposed to have that Friday off and with Agatha still on break, they'd formed a loose plan for brunch and mimosas. Thursday night, just before midnight, Agatha got a text. It was just a screenshot of a text from someone named Marcus Buchanan.</p><p>
<i>"Hey, Rio. I really hate to ask this of you, but Mitchells is out with COVID and there's no one else that can cover the ED tomorrow. I'm requesting that you come in to cover. Within my ability, I will try to get you out the door as soon as possible, but I am not able to offer anything less than a 5pm end time."</i>
</p><p>Agatha's lips turned down at the corners. She had the thought that she <i>really</i> hoped Rio got approved for the transfer again because this was grating, even if Agatha did not blame Rio herself. It seemed as though any time they even tried to sketch a blueprint of what Rio's time off might look like, she no longer had it. It was frustrating; more than just missing out on time spent together, Agatha was very actively watching as Rio drove herself into the ground day after day with little time to take care of herself.</p><p>Agatha had stared at the phone for the longest moment, part of her waiting to see if there was going to be a follow-up from Rio. Did there really need to be? Agatha already knew she was upset, she was agitated, she was tired of this happening. The thing that made those feelings valid was that Rio was already trying to course correct, having submitted that application. Rio knew that if she stayed in the department she was in, it would always be like this.</p><p>Agatha could see very clearly that Rio did not want things to stay this way forever.</p><p>Agatha cradled the phone in both hands, staring down at it as she tried to figure out what to say. She typed for a moment but stopped before she sent it.</p><p>
<i>I can bring you lunch at the hospital instead, if you want.</i>
</p><p>She read it over at least four times before she hit the backspace arrow and demolished the message back to an empty text box. After a moment, she gave it another go.</p><p>
<i>You can come over after, even if it's the later end of that. I picked up some portabellas at the market. I can make you dinner.</i>
</p><p>Ugh. Desperate. Another continued pressure on the backspace obliterated another message.</p><p>Agatha stared hard down at the empty text box. Why couldn't she find the right thing to say when she knew someone she cared about was upset? Why couldn't she type out a message that didn't sound clingy and desperate on her end when Rio was the one who needed soothing?</p><p>Fuck this.</p><p>Agatha pressed the phone icon up in the corner of her message with Rio and lifted the phone to her ear as it began to ring.</p><p>Rio's voice sounded tired -- and even a bit sad -- as it came over the line.</p><p>"Agatha? Everything okay?" she asked, though near the end of her question Agatha could hear as she yawned.</p><p>"Yes. I mean. No. I mean..." She stopped herself and pressed her lips together, her gaze landing across the room on the fireplace. "<i>I</i> am fine. <i>You</i> are upset."</p><p>A breathed chuckle crackled softly over the line and the sound of it made Agatha's stomach squeeze uncertainly.</p><p>"You know that, do you?" Rio asked back, though her low tones weren't instigative. They were almost... surprised.</p><p>"I do," Agatha responded, standing from her spot on the couch as she began to pace the living room in a back and forth that was no more than five feet from end to end. "And... I know that because I understand how I feel about what you sent me, and if I feel that way, it stands to reason that I have a decent understanding of how it makes you feel, too."</p><p>There was silence over the line for a few very long seconds, seconds where Agatha actually started to wonder if Rio had fallen asleep. Instead, she was soaking in the pride she was feeling at hearing Agatha speak like that.</p><p>"I'm..." A soft sigh passed through Rio's lips and Agatha was almost certain she heard the anguish there. "Discouraged. Not from you, or us, at all. Just... All I want is to see you more days of the week than I don't. I want to be able to give you a version of me that isn't immediately ready to crawl into bed to fall asleep. And I thought I could do that on a Friday morning by going to brunch with my girlfriend."</p><p>Oh!</p><p>That was new.</p><p>There was a first time for everything, obviously, but it had happened in a very natural way that Agatha had not been expecting. As a result, she nearly choked on the way her heart had leapt into her throat, but played it off with a feigned cough that Rio surely knew was not real.</p><p>"Well..." Agatha managed smoothly, doing what she could to recover. "As I already know you'll be covering that shift tomorrow, what can I do to make it better? I can bring you lunch? You can come over for dinner?"</p><p>"You know how grumpy I can be when I'm tired and you know I'm about to get less than five hours of sleep. You do not want to try to tame the beast I will be at 5 pm tomorrow." Rio was saying it like it was a warning, but didn't she know Agatha better than that? Didn't she realize that the only way that was ever going to hit Agatha's ears was in a challenge?</p><p>"Oh, nothing a good shoulder massage and being hand-fed grapes wouldn't cure," Agatha offered dismissively, though the instant curling of her smirk had to be audible over the line.</p><p>"Agatha," Rio returned through another yawn.</p><p>"Don't tell me no, Rio," Agatha offered back, though there was more of a plea in there than she would ever be comfortable acknowledging.</p><p>"Alright, Agatha. I will see you tomorrow around 5:30. And there better be red grapes, not green ones." It was an attempt to be menacing, but it simply drew an appreciative laugh from Agatha.</p><p>"You've got it."</p><p>"I love you, Agatha."</p><p>This had been the first time they'd spoken outside of texts since Rio had left after the storm. Agatha should have known she was going to say it but it still somehow whipped right by her, slicing her cheek with a razor sharp edge. The sting was immediate but only in the sense that she had no defenses, nothing to say back.</p><p>So, Agatha said her truth instead.</p><p>"I know, Rio. Get some sleep."</p><p>And so things had rolled along in a similar vein as the days progressed. They had met that night, and then again early Sunday morning when Agatha had forced herself out of bed at four thirty in the morning to meet Rio for coffee -- and obviously tea for Agatha -- before she had to head in that day.</p><p>They'd spent almost an hour perched at a hightop table in the corner, Rio's foot gently sliding up and down the length of Agatha's shin as they talked in a soft back and forth of what the coming new year might bring. For Rio, she was hopeful it was the transfer she was still waiting to hear back on.</p><p>She had her answer New Year's Eve.</p><p>It was just after 3 pm and Agatha had been in the midst of rearranging the furniture in her living room when her phone dinged softly from its resting place on the dining room table. When she picked it up and opened it, she saw a photo of the transfer form Rio had submitted the week before.</p><p>Across the top, there was a bright red ink mark in the impression of a stamp that simply said: APPROVED.</p><p>Immediately, Agatha's fingers were flying over the keyboard.</p><p>"Rio! Congratulations! I am so happy for you!"</p><p>She must have still been working because it took a little over an hour before Agatha received a response.</p><p>"I'm happy for us."</p><p>The transfer was still going to take a few days longer, Rio had informed her when she had called Agatha that night as they both climbed into bed. She explained it a little better, how it would work and what her new schedule would look like. Rio had told her that while she would still have an on-call weekend or two throughout the month, that would likely change as well once Johan, Rio's friend, was back at work.</p><p>That was the first night they'd fallen asleep on the phone together, right after Rio wished Agatha a happy new year and reminded her again that she was loved.</p><p>The last thing Agatha heard at the end of the year was that she was loved.</p><p>As nice as it might have been to share in a kiss, there was something about what had happened instead that was a little more important to Agatha.</p><p>There was responsibility there. It was a declaration that no matter what the year ahead of them had in store, they were there to support one another through it. There was duty to the fact that change was inevitable but they could choose to do it for the better, for each other.</p><p>The day before Agatha went back to class, Rio completed her transfer and started her first day in pediatrics. They met up for dinner that night where Agatha had decided to spoil her with a bouquet of exotic flowers and a small present that she passed across the table as they sipped at their celebratory champagne.</p><p>"Agatha," Rio chastised, pulling the box closer to her. "You shouldn't have gotten me anything."</p><p>Agatha took another sip of the bubbly and offered a nonchalant shrug as she hesitated, the mouth of the flute still close to her lips as Rio unwrapped the gift, her face softening in the blink of an eye.</p><p>"How did you know the right one to get?" Rio asked, placing the box of Jimmy Choo's Eau De Parfum in the palm of her hand as she looked down at it in wonder.</p><p>"It's taken me the last month and a half to figure it out, but... When I smelled you wearing it the night we met at the bar, I had to know what it was."</p><p>Rio's eyes sparkled with admiration and the most genuine smile graced her lips.</p><p>"That's dedication, my love."</p><p>A bolt of searingly cold ice rocketed up Agatha's spine, but the moment it collided with the very top of her skull, it blew apart and warmth rained its way back down her entire body.</p><p>
<i>My love.</i>
</p><p>Rio was not cavalier by any means. That was not who she was. But the way she said those things, used <i>that word</i> with such ease, it often incapacitated Agatha in a way that left her fumbling to make sense of her own life. How could it be so easy for Rio and so goddamned hard for Agatha?</p><p>"Yeah, well. If there was ever a night to talk about dedication, it would be tonight, hm?" Agatha told her, a warm grin of appreciation filling her features.</p><p>The following Wednesday, Agatha had returned to her normal schedule as break concluded. It had been a nice respite, and admittedly she had done quite a bit in regards to her life in just two weeks. It was something to be proud of, surely, but she did not lend too much weight to it in the grand scheme of things. There were far more important things to work toward being proud of.</p><p>With her new schedule, Rio was off for the most part on Fridays and Saturdays, but starting with her first full week, she only worked half a day one Tuesday a month. This had been an at-length conversation between them in which they had also worked to establish a more consistent schedule of when they could actually spend time together.</p><p>What Agatha had not realized in the midst of that conversation was that Rio was making her own plans.</p><p>Friday, she had gotten to work on time after she'd woken up to the sound of Rio snoring on the other end of her charging phone though she'd fought herself as long as she could on actually ending the call. Waking Rio up was absolutely not an option, though. This was the first time in likely years that she had a day off of work where she could just sleep in and enjoy the peace.</p><p>Agatha felt good to be back in her domain, to have the attention on her as she paced the floor of that lecture hall. She knew that when she could tilt her head back and project knowledge onto the men and women in that hall, she was serving a purpose. She was doing something she was good at. Maybe it was the only thing she was good at, anymore.</p><p>She certainly wasn't good at keeping walls up. She wasn't good at protecting and guarding herself. She wasn't good at telling Rio no and genuinely meaning it.</p><p>All of Agatha's shortcomings weren't actually shortcomings, it was just the dismantling of her psyche after fifteen years of solitude and running. It was her actually having to stop and assess what it was she was doing and what it was she wanted out of life. For the time being, she was allowing herself to want Rio and the emotion she brought into Agatha's life, no matter how uncomfortable it could sometimes be.</p><p>And then, there were moments when Agatha turned her gaze back to the sea full of students and her eyes swept over someone out of place where Agatha was almost convinced that she could <i>feel </i>the one thing she could not <i>say.</i></p><p>There, fifth row up and two seats in, wearing a teal baseball cap that sported sunglasses that were not needed inside and a olive green bomber jacket with a black t-shirt underneath, sat Rio Vidal looking just as interested in the lecture Agatha was delivering about psychoanalytic criticism as every other participating student in that hall.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha fumbled. She stammered over the words she'd been in the process of speaking but then forced herself to divert her attention elsewhere. She could not brave a look at the wicked and bratty smirk Rio was surely donning at the bumbling she had so easily induced.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and began speaking again, but she spent the rest of the lecture in a very active battle to not cast her eyes toward her little shit of a girlfriend as she listened in on a lecture she had absolutely no use for. Even when she had been answering questions, Agatha had forcibly looked away every single time Rio raised her hand to indicate she had something to say. Surely, she already knew Agatha was absolutely not going to engage in that regard, but she was still choosing to be rotten anyway.</p><p>As the class ended and the throngs of students collected and stowed their things, Agatha busied herself with organizing the papers on her desk to slide them into a folder. She moved on to close out the windows on her laptop to reveal a photo of the Berlin wall and a black cat that sat at the base of it. She then shut down the laptop and closed the screen. Her eyes still did not lift as she packed the computer into her bag, even though she could feel Rio watching her.</p><p>Agatha snapped the clip on her bag and had turned to head toward her office, but she was stopped by the sound of Rio's voice as it carried through the now-empty room.</p><p>"Not your favorite lecture, hm?" Rio posed, an undeniable ring of amusement in her tone.</p><p>"Freud is a crackpot, but he's unfortunately the most prolific example of the topic. But I move on next week, so I'm not that pressed about it. Just part of the curriculum, sadly." Agatha gave a light shrug of her shoulders as she pulled her coat over them after she grabbed it from the door handle to her office.</p><p>"Noted," Rio mused, that humor still overtaking her at just how much she'd surprised Agatha.</p><p>"So... Did you come to watch me sputter like an idiot or is there perhaps another motive for your appearance in my lecture hall?" Agatha posed as she made her way toward Rio, climbing the stairs to stop at the end of the row she was in.</p><p>Rio tilted her head up to take in her girlfriend, a sly grin pushing up her cheeks.</p><p>"It's my first half-day off in a while," Rio mused with a slight shrug. "I know you don't have an afternoon lecture today so I was hoping that you might join me for lunch and then accompany me to the Museum of Comparative Zoology. I picked up tickets this morning, but if you don't want to, that's okay too. I just thought it might be nice..."</p><p>The warmth that suddenly washed over Agatha was enough to cause her reserves to soften. Each time she started to feel like she needed to find all the reasons this wouldn't work, Rio was <i>right fucking there</i> shoving every reason to stay right in her face.</p><p>"Well, lead the way. I'm starving."</p><p>The easy grin on Rio's face caused Agatha's breath to catch in her chest. That grin was an acknowledgement that even though Agatha was still in an active battle to work through her own issues, she was not going to push Rio away at any chance she could find. She was instead going to embrace the uncomfortable and realize that it wasn't going to hurt her. Rio was not going to hurt her.</p><p>The day they had spent together had been sweet in a way Agatha hadn't known she needed. They had ventured to a pizza kitchen for a bite to eat and then made their way back toward campus to spend a couple of hours at the museum. They'd strolled through the exhibits hand-in-hand and honestly, Agatha let Rio flourish in a space that was meant for her.</p><p>She would stop at an exhibit and offer a brief explanation of her own thoughts and feelings about it, sounding like she knew exactly what she was talking about.</p><p>Agatha had always liked listening to Rio talk. She liked even more when she got to listen to Rio talk about things she loved.  She was even getting closer to a point where she could be okay with being one of those things Rio talked about with that kind of passion and fervor. It still felt heavy, still felt like it was praise that she was still so undeserving of, but she knew that asking Rio to bottle those things up would have been far worse than pushing herself to adapt.</p><p>When they hit the cool air, it was Agatha that had turned toward the woman she cared for. It was Agatha who reached up to tuck some stray strands of hair behind her ear. It was Agatha who looked Rio in the eyes and whispered her soft request.</p><p>
<i>"Come home with me."</i>
</p><p>It was the first time she had explicitly made the request where she had not felt that it was imperative. It was the first time she was looking Rio in the eye and willingly asking her to spend time in a space that no one else in the world would ever have the chance to occupy. Rio had agreed and Agatha had used every minute of their night to prove to Rio what it meant to her.</p><p>There had been a ferocity that had formed in them the night they were almost too drunk to log the events of their first physical encounter. While they had more tender moments that Agatha would have previously been uneasy at having, the moment clothes came off and the lust was peaking, that raw and almost primal demeanor always dropped right into their skin.</p><p>Due to the emotional progress Agatha had been making, Rio had been a little hands-off in regard to modifying any other facet of their physical relationship.</p><p>Rio ate up every moment that Agatha tossed her around, pinned her to any available flat surface. She seemed to be living for the way Agatha didn't hesitate to place and shift her into any position she was demanding in whatever sultry moment they were wrapped in. Rio seemed to <i>really </i>enjoy the part of the evening that had started the moment Agatha disappeared into the bathroom, returning only a moment later completely bare aside from the leather harness that was woven over and around her hips, the moderately sized appendage hanging down between her legs.</p><p>The first sound that had come out of Rio had been enough to make Agatha weak in the knees, but it was only the first in a series that damn near could have crippled her. They pinged around the walls of that townhome not giving a single care that they were making enough noise to draw concern if anyone had been able to hear them.</p><p>Their final destination had ended up being Agatha's office that was just down the hall from her bedroom. She wasn't even sure how they had ended up there. As she stood with Rio's ass pressed to the edge of the desk and her leg lifted up over Agatha's shoulder, and Agatha gave a calculated and measured thrust? The shuddering wail that violently tore itself out of Rio's throat left Agatha feeling like a feral animal.</p><p>Although Agatha had helped set Rio's foot back on the ground, she hadn't moved much and had instead trapped Rio where she was, placing kisses over a few of her more prominent features, like her jaw and cheekbones. As Rio began to find metaphorical solid footing, too, Agatha couldn't fight the grin that had taken over her face.</p><p><i>"That," </i>Rio had panted as she leaned in to steal a brief kiss. <i>"More of that. All the time."</i></p><p>Waking up the next morning on a day when neither of them had work or responsibilities, it was the most intense mixture of comforting and exciting. To be met with the vision of Rio asleep on her stomach, face turned away from Agatha although her soft snores were still audible, was to know divinity.</p><p>She had let Rio sleep for most of the morning, only daring to start breakfast just after ten. It wasn't much, but she had pressed a couple of waffles and set out the butter and syrup. The scents that had been forming as a result of her effort had been enough to stir the sleeping Rio and Agatha's face filled with a tender smile as she came down the stairs. It brightened as she realized Rio was clothed in only her Harvard sweatshirt.</p><p>They'd shared breakfast, over which Rio had disclosed that she had somewhere to be that evening. Agatha wasn't disappointed, exactly, but there was that patterned uncertainty over their next reunion when it came to Rio's career.</p><p>And then she realized it in only a beat.</p><p>That wasn't something they had to worry about anymore.</p><p>They could part ways without concrete plans and know still that they could have dinner at least once throughout the week. At least.</p><p>Agatha hadn't pried, hadn't asked Rio to disclose her plans, but the way Rio had leaned forward, twisting her fork mindlessly into the confection on the plate below her said something more. There was this curve to her lips that Agatha almost wanted to call a smirk, but it hadn't quite reached that point. The most noticeable part, though, was that bright light dancing in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha tried to pretend like she didn't notice, but there was a dare written all over Rio's face.</p><p>Agatha's lips pursed and she reached for her mug, taking a sip of her tea. The entire time, she never once looked at Rio.</p><p>"If you'd like to tell me, you can," Agatha stated, setting her mug back down to pick up her fork again. She was still keeping her gaze to her phone, which was open but on her app screen.</p><p>"You don't want to know?" Rio returned, glancing down to cut a piece of her waffle before spearing it with the tines of the fork.</p><p>"It's not an active want, no," Agatha responded coolly. "I'm not your babysitter, Rio. You don't have to run your schedule by me for approval. We're grown women and you are allowed to have a social life outside of the time we spend together."</p><p>Rio simply blinked at her.</p><p>Agatha's gaze finally lifted and the smile she had to offer was tempered and even, a silent beguiling that asked: <i>What?</i></p><p>"Did you think I would be jealous?" Agatha asked, eyes locked this time as she grabbed her mug and took another measured sip of the hot tea. She hardly even blinked.</p><p>"With your need for control? I mean, a little."</p><p>As offensive as that could have been, Agatha's open mouth instead snapped shut and her lips turned down at the corners, puckering slightly in the middle in a show of understanding.</p><p>"You have friends, Rio. And... Admittedly, I'm putting a lot of faith in the fact that I do not think you would have sunk months worth of effort into building this between us to simply step out on me," Agatha explained, pausing to take another sip of the bergamot tea. She lowered the mug steadily and placed it on the table.</p><p>"That is... Actually very perceptive of you," Rio commented back, placing another bite of waffle into her mouth as she chewed, her eyes studying Agatha's expression, trying to discern what Agatha might actually be thinking, but for once, Agatha was being quite forward.</p><p>"So... As I said. If you'd like to tell me what your plans are for this evening, I am all ears. If you would like to keep them to yourself, that's fine, too." Agatha's voice was controlled, but it was not cold or uncaring. It was the best way she could manage to convey exactly what she was trying to say. She expected mysticism from Rio, but what she got instead?</p><p>Rio laughed.</p><p>Agatha's eyes cut back to her, narrowing a little in question. Her brows knit slightly, but a moment later, smoothed out above those interrogative blue eyes.</p><p>"Care to share with the class?" Agatha asked, this time not looking away.</p><p>Rio reached down casually, picking up the last bite of her waffle before she tossed it into her mouth, staring Agatha directly in the eye. Agatha was ready for some coded comment or some statement of incredulity, but Rio offered none of that.</p><p>Instead, Rio made the choice to share.</p><p>"Johan and Julia invited me over to have dinner with them as well as Julia's twin and her husband. So, basically hetero central." Rio hesitated, dark gaze dropping into her coffee for a moment as she considered something. Agatha was watching her, assessing what might possibly come out of her mouth next.</p><p>Rio picked up her coffee and took a slow pull before she set it back down.</p><p>"You are more than welcome to accompany me, if you would like, as I know no one else would take any issue with an additional guest. However, I did not provide it as an option because I made the assumption that it would not be something you'd like to pencil into your schedule quite yet."</p><p>It was Agatha's turn to blink.</p><p>"It was an assumption," Agatha finally stated, leaning back in her chair a little. "But it was a safe one. Can't say I'm exactly ready for the 'meet-the-friends' date, yet."</p><p>Rio visibly relaxed, her fingers toying with the handle of the mug in front of her. Slowly, a careful smile found her lips.</p><p>"Yet, hm?" Rio hummed, the delight so plain across her beautiful features.</p><p>"Don't push it, Vidal."</p><p>*****</p><p>In a practice of self-restraint, Agatha and Rio had agreed that they would put a dinner date in stone for Wednesday evening. It would be earlier in the evening and they could decide what they were going to do with the rest of their evening once they convened at the restaurant.</p><p>Agatha saw what Rio was doing. She was helping her build these houses made of cards. They were structures in their own right, but they were subject to change with a ghost of a breeze. It could be rebuilt quickly with deft hands, if need be. Rio was leaving a back door in every single plan they made, consistently offering Agatha an out. What Rio did not realize was that Agatha was no longer actively looking for the exit.</p><p>So, with their Wednesday plan set, Agatha had gone on about her week. By Tuesday, it had completely slipped her mind that Rio's schedule had changed in any way to that point.</p><p>It was just after noon and Agatha found herself distracted as she sat in her office, looking over a paper that one of her students had asked for some advice on. Truthfully, Agatha wanted to be home. She wanted to be texting her busy girlfriend as she sipped at tea and read poetry. She wanted to relax, to not focus on work any more that day.</p><p>The student in question was a twenty-year-old woman with long and curly blonde hair that had been dyed blue at the tips. Her name was Marley and honestly, she was a good student. That much was evident by the fact that she was seeking assistance instead of turning in something that wasn't polished or ready.</p><p>Marley was also an insane flirt.</p><p><i>That </i>was obvious in the way she was directly next to where Agatha sat, but she was leaned back on her hands, part of her ass spilling over the edge of the desk. She was looking down at Agatha with a bright smile even though Agatha was paying her little attention. Even as a stray pinky extended and brushed against Agatha's wrist, she did not acknowledge it.</p><p>As it turned out, she didn't have to.</p><p>The acknowledgement was made by the bag that was dropped onto Agatha's desk over her shoulder, almost like it were loaded with an anvil.</p><p>"I thought I'd surprise you with lunch. Clearly, you're busy. See you later, I guess."</p><p>The sound of Rio's voice behind her sent a spike of panic through Agatha that nearly choked her. Where the fuck had she come from? Before she could spin around, she felt a firm kiss to the side of her head and then the sound of Rio's footsteps on the linoleum faded as she got further away.</p><p>The moment she caught up, Agatha was on her feet and ripping out of the office back into the hall to try and catch Rio.</p><p>"Rio! Wait! What the fuck?!" Agatha called after her, but Rio kept walking up the stairs, headed for the door.</p><p>"I'll see you later, Agatha," Rio asserted again and this only angered Agatha.</p><p>"No! You don't get to --!" Agatha had started, but the door to the lecture hall clicked shut and Agatha halted in place, her face fixed in anger and confusion. She stood in those emotions for only a moment before she was moving, storming back into her office. "I'm sorry, I have to go. We can finish this up tomorrow. Have a good afternoon."</p><p>Agatha had collected her coat and her bag and was only a little pushy in trying to get Marley out of her office. Once she managed it, she locked up and pulled her phone out as she headed for the exit. She brought up Rio's contact and called her, bringing the phone to her ear as she bustled through the hallway. It rang. And it kept ringing.</p><p>Then, Rio's general mailbox answered and Agatha let out a grunt of frustration as she disconnected the call. As she pushed her way out into the cold afternoon air, she dialed another time and was met again with Rio's voicemail.</p><p>Agatha stopped in the middle of the sidewalk and furiously punched in a message.</p><p>
<i>Call me.</i>
</p><p>She was already flagging down a cab to take her to Rio's apartment, but for every minute that she saw the little <i>Read: 12:19 </i>message below her request, Agatha was growing angry.</p><p>
<i>Rio, fucking call me. What the fuck.</i>
</p><p>In less than a minute, there was a new indicator.</p><p>
<i>Read: 12:23.</i>
</p><p><i>"Argh!"</i> Agatha cried in frustration, nearly punching holes in her phone screen with the force she was using to compose the next message.</p><p>
<i>I'm on my way over. I'll sit out there all goddamn night until you talk to me.</i>
</p><p>And then, another.</p><p>
<i>Read: 12:28.</i>
</p><p>Just as Agatha went to call her again, the little bubble with the ellipses appeared on the left side of the screen. After another few seconds, a message appeared.</p><p>
<i>The door's unlocked.</i>
</p><p>Smart move, Agatha thought. She would have stood on that step and shouted herself hoarse, surely drawing the attention of the neighbors, until Rio would give her the conversation she felt she was owed.</p><p>Another few minutes passed and the car rolled to a stop at the curb in front of Rio's condo. Taking the front steps two at a time, Agatha nearly barrelled through the front door as she pushed into the home.</p><p>"Rio!" she called, moving with haste to shuck her coat, though she carelessly tossed it toward the closet without any regard to the way it dropped to the floor. She kicked off her shoes and tore off toward the steps. She made it to the second floor and was turning to head to the third when she saw the door to the greenhouse open.</p><p>Agatha stopped and took a moment to collect herself.</p><p>The truth was, she had no fucking clue what had happened. Was it the touch? Was it the fact that Agatha hadn't been a frigid bitch and asked her student to wait on the other side of the room while she revised her paper?</p><p>Did any of that really matter? Rio was angry and Agatha was frustrated because she literally hadn't done anything.</p><p>Carefully, Agatha paced forward and placed herself in the doorway, leaning against the frame with her arms folded across her middle. Rio was clearly busying herself with the work in front of her, repotting one of the plants.</p><p>"Rio, will you please talk to me?" Agatha requested in a light but hurt tone.</p><p>"There's nothing to talk about, Agatha," Rio spat back over her shoulder and Agatha actually felt the injury the words inflicted.</p><p>She was silent for a long few moments, stewing in the pain that this interaction was imbuing upon her.</p><p>"No, Rio. You absolutely do not get to do that," Agatha finally announced and while her voice was still soft, it was undeniably pointed and there was even a slight edge to it. "You do not get to be angry with me without asking any questions. You don't get to just stomp out without some kind of a explanation."</p><p>"I mean, it was pretty self-explanatory," Rio bit and the chill in her tone was paining Agatha somewhere in the middle of her chest.</p><p>Agatha's face twisted, the indignation filling her wholly. "Then tell me what you think you saw, Rio," she managed, but her voice did not betray exactly what it was she was feeling in those moments.</p><p>At this, Rio turned on her and she looked... Angry wasn't the right word.</p><p>Rio looked scared.</p><p>"I saw a student <i>flirting</i> with you, Agatha!" she accused, her hands balling at her sides. "And you sat there and let it happen!"</p><p>Agatha immediately recognized what was going on.</p><p>There was little doubt that Rio could feel the way she did about Agatha for anyone else. Rio had made that abundantly clear. She had used her words very precisely to make that fact known.</p><p>Agatha did not have the same ability. Agatha could not find the right words to tell Rio that she was committed, that she didn't care for the idea of trying to find connection anywhere else. Hell, she hadn't even been looking for it with Rio. Now that she had it, though, she was not ready to let it go.</p><p>She didn't know how to make Rio understand that, though.</p><p>"And?" Agatha prodded softly, stepping further into the greenhouse. Rio's gaze narrowed dangerously, but Agatha only slowed her approach. She did not ever stop moving completely. "You didn't see me touching her in return. You didn't see me making out with her. You didn't see me bending her over my desk to fuck her. Because I don't <i>want</i> any of that, Rio," Agatha informed her. Her arms were still tight around her middle, like she was guarding herself.</p><p>"What I <i>wanted</i> was to come home and text you because I am not used to your new schedule and did not know you were off today. What I <i>wanted</i> was to ask you about your day while I tried to teach myself how to cook the tofu I bought the other day in case we decided not to go out tomorrow."</p><p>Agatha continued her journey, crossing those last few feet of space between them.</p><p>"What I <i>want</i> is you, Rio. And... I am sorry if my inability to say that in so many words is what made you feel like I have any interest in directing my attention elsewhere, especially some twenty-something year old college student that I wanted out of my office as soon as I could get her out." Agatha's eyes were soft as they took Rio in, as they traced over her slightly taut features and tried to assess what her next move should be.</p><p><i>"What I want right now is for you to let me kiss you and spend the rest of the day taking care of you in whatever way you will allow." </i> Agatha's voice was barely above a whisper as she stopped so close that she could feel Rio's breath on her lips.</p><p>Rio's expression only cinched tighter. She didn't immediately vocalize a response and Agatha tipped her head, encouraging her to say what it was she was thinking.</p><p><i>"I..."</i> Rio pressed, and Agatha was taking only the smallest delight from seeing Rio be the one to fumble for words. <i>"I just had an entire temper tantrum because I got jealous... and you're asking me to let you take care of me?"</i></p><p>Agatha was quick in her return, hands lifting to cradle Rio's jaw in her palms. She leaned forward and placed an understanding kiss to those soft and full lips.</p><p><i>"Yes. Which can include and not be limited to cooking you a meal, giving you a massage, fucking the jealousy right out of you..."</i> Agatha murmured, her voice husky and low as some of the honey of those words passed from her lips to Rio's.</p><p>Rio's hands lifted and her fingers circled around Agatha's thin wrists, but she did not try to pull her away. Instead, she initiated another locking of their lips, folding and smacking for a long moment. When she pulled away, those beautiful dark eyes opened and Agatha found herself wanting to drown in them.</p><p>
<i>"When you say things like that... No, exactly that, it really does compel me to the fullest extent to assert that I love you."</i>
</p><p>Agatha breathed a light chuckle against Rio's lips.</p><p>
<i>"I won't be saying the last bit too frequently. If I fuck the jealousy out of you, I'm most certainly going to make sure it doesn't come back."</i>

<p>Agatha had, in fact, fucked the jealousy out of Rio.</p><p>It had taken a couple of hours, but the moment that Agatha had laid her torso along the length of Rio's back, lips dangerous close to Rio's ear, and growled the words <i>"I am only yours,"</i> Agatha could feel as Rio burst apart in her hold. She'd even lowered Rio gingerly to the bed as she could feel the weight of collapse beneath her. By the time she had shed the harness and pressed her skin back to Rio's, Agatha felt pretty pleased with her effort.</p><p>She'd managed to clear away any remaining speck of it with the way she'd placed a few kisses on Rio's back and urged her not to fall asleep. It had taken her only a couple of minutes, but Agatha had returned with a plate balanced in one hand that held sweet peppers with cream cheese and everything bagel seasoning, and two lowball glasses with ice spheres pinched between fingers of the other hand. Beneath her arm was the bottle of Blanton's that was a little over half-gone, now.</p><p>The way Rio, who had shifted to a sitting position, softened at the sight told Agatha that Rio might actually believe her when she promised that there was no intention to stray.</p><p>She knew that the nerves had been there, and Agatha got it, completely, and she'd felt the need to explain as much as she placed herself on the bed next to Rio and handed a filled glass over.</p><p>"I understand it," Agatha voiced, though she immediately took a bite of a pepper to stall long enough to find her phrasing. "You can only know your own intentions until I'm able to give you a reason to trust mine."</p><p>Rio paused where she was, her mouth open and teeth just barely away from sinking into a bite of her food. Slowly, she withdrew the pepper and lowered her hand to hold it in her lap. Her head turned, dark eyes taking in the sight of Agatha's smooth profile.</p><p>"Jealousy is... It's a fine line to walk. In instances, it's warranted because not everyone is trustworthy. And I am not perturbed by the idea that you cannot fully trust me yet, because I know I'm trying everyday to give you reasons you can. Your patience in the matter is... Well, in some parts of the world, they would call you a saint." Agatha turned to the nightstand and picked up her glass, taking a quick pull before she set it back down and turned to look Rio in the eyes.</p><p>"I also believe that jealousy is borne from panic and anxiety. I cannot hear your thoughts, but... With all that I have learned about you, I can hazard a guess that you ask yourself 'Am I enough?' more times than you will ever admit, and I mean that in various other instances outside of you and I." The way Rio was looking at Agatha compelled her to stop talking. Her lips pressed and she tried to assess what it was that was twisted into her expression.</p><p>It was awe. It was reverence. It was respect and appreciation.</p><p>It was Rio getting a taste of what Agatha could be like when she learned to vocalize some of the things she had only resigned to paper before.</p><p>"I... I can stop..." Agatha tried, but it was nervous.</p><p>"No, please keep going," Rio returned, her voice low but encouraging.</p><p>Agatha's lips worried together for a brief moment before she was able to discover the direction she wanted this to go in her own mind.</p><p>"I'm not upset with you that you had an emotion. I was upset with how you chose to deal with it." Agatha hesitated and reached up to brush her fingertips along the scape of Rio's cheek. "You could have, and should have, talked to me. You should have knocked on the door so I could get up and hug you. Hell, I might have been so bold as to kiss you, but my lecture tomorrow might turn into a riot. You'd be breaking a lot of hearts, I am certain."</p><p>Agatha's touch shifted so that she could palm Rio's jaw, her thumb moving to brush along her cheekbone.</p><p>"The point I am trying to make is that if there's ever a question you have, about absolutely anything, you just have to <i>ask</i> me. You have previously asked me the hardest question to answer, and I told you it even though it was the last thing I wanted to do. Because I trust you, and I know that's not enough to inspire mutuality, but... It <i>is</i> proof that if you ask me a question, I will be honest in my responses."</p><p>Rio had been still and quiet up to that point. She did not move for only a second longer before she broke through the stun she had been delivered. It wasn't a grand gesture, but it was blaring in Agatha's head as Rio turned her head slightly, toward Agatha's palm and placed a kiss there. She left her lips pressed to the rough skin for a moment before she breathed her sentiment, a familiar sentiment, against it.</p><p>"I love you, Agatha."</p><p>This time, Agatha's immediate response was different.</p><p>"Me too, Rio."</p><p>*****</p><p>The next few weeks offered the opportunity for something a little more routine. They weren't exactly scheduling dates anymore and that was something Agatha had come to like more than she thought she was capable of.</p><p>She liked when her phone rang in the evenings some time between 5:10 and 5:30. She liked when she picked it up to hear the sound of Rio's voice, no matter what tone she was using. Sometimes, it was low and sad because she'd had a long day. Other times, it was lighter and brighter because something amazing had happened. No matter which Rio was calling, Agatha was always happy to hear her.</p><p>Agatha had been quite a homebody in the last couple of years, but Rio had made it a point to get her out more. They would shop for odds and ends, little knick-knacks or things that seemed practical or useful. On more than one occasion, Rio had snagged an infuser -- one was a narwhal and the other was an axolotl -- without Agatha knowing to only present it to her on the sidewalk outside of the shop they had just exited.</p><p>It would make Agatha grin every single time. The sloth had been the only one of its kind, but somehow knowing that it had friends because of Rio's sense of humor offered a warmth that Agatha found difficult to place.</p><p>There had been an instance during one of their outings that <i>almost</i> made Agatha blurt it out, <i>almost</i> made her tell Rio how she really felt, but the phrase got stuck in her throat and she had done nothing else but swallow it back down.</p><p>They'd found themselves in Mem Tea at Rio's behest, although Agatha had plenty of what stock they currently had at home. She had still found herself perusing, but she was listening. Rio was talking to the employee, asking questions that she surely thought were too low for Agatha to hear.</p><p>
<i>"So that one's better for anxiety? And this one's better for sleep?"</i>
</p><p>
<i>"This is the one that tastes like tree bark if you steep it for too long?"</i>
</p><p>
<i>"But what's the best kind of infuser for the Silver Beauty?"</i>
</p><p>Rio was asking questions to learn about things that were important to Agatha. Rio was teaching herself without putting the burden of doing so on Agatha's shoulders. Rio was showing initiative, she was proving how much she cared. Agatha did not doubt that Rio was aware she could have answered all those questions, but there was something to be said for the fact that Rio had not immediately placed the onus on Agatha to be the one to explain.</p><p>Agatha's career was built on her ability to teach. Rio was making it a point to tell Agatha that it was not her duty to do so in the space of their relationship without actually saying anything to her at all.</p><p>They spent more nights together, too.</p><p>More often than not, Rio would 'stop by' with the goal of only staying an hour or two after work -- which was only made more convenient by the fact that Agatha's home was quite a bit closer than Rio's own -- and yet time and time again, she was waking up the next morning just a short while before Agatha so they could both get ready for work.</p><p>On those nights, Rio had developed a new habit. She would bring up the camera on her phone and lean into Agatha, holding it out so that she could snap a photo of them. The first one had been their cheeks pressed together with smiles that were wide and genuine. Agatha was a little stunned as she looked at it when Rio presented it to her.</p><p>It was the first time she'd ever seen herself look so <i>happy.</i></p><p>There were more. There were ones of Rio kissing her cheek. There were ones where she'd snapped her head to the side at the last second and bit the angle of Rio's jaw.</p><p>And then, there were exactly three where they were kissing. One clearly displayed Rio's teeth hooked into Agatha's bottom lip. Another caught the still of Agatha's fingertips pressed gently into the flesh of Rio's cheek.</p><p>Agatha's favorite was one Rio had taken when they were laying down. They were kissing, and it had been a soft and sweet kiss, but there was beauty in the way their hair was a mess across the pillows. There was even more beauty in the smile that had curled Rio's lips despite the pressure they had against Agatha's.</p><p>She had not informed Rio that it was her favorite, but Rio had probably gauged as much based on the number of times she had caught Agatha looking at it after Rio had sent it to her.</p><p>It was a private memory Agatha wanted to hold onto for as long as she could.</p><p>Or... It <i>had </i>been a private memory.</p><p>At least, until the Thursday morning that Agatha had woken up to the feeling of soft kisses on her neck as her alarm rang clear from the nightstand.</p><p>She swung a hand out and grabbed it, immediately silencing it before dropping it back down to clunk against the wood. Her groggy mind slowly floated back into place and she was instantly aware of the fact that Rio was still in bed with her.</p><p><i>"Mmm, you're going to be late for work,"</i> Agatha hummed, her voice still thick with sleep.</p><p>
<i>"I'm going in late today. Julia wanted to pick up a half-shift and I wanted to stay in bed with you."</i>
</p><p>A tired grin filled Agatha's face and she let her head lull to the side in a way that allowed her lips to grace Rio's forehead. Agatha had been content with the idea of just enjoying the closeness, with laying there a little longer until she had to rush to get ready for the job she still needed to show up for.</p><p>Rio had other plans.</p><p>It had been a mess of teeth on skin, of Rio gripping hard enough to leave all the bruises that Agatha loved. It had devolved into Agatha flipping her over, tugging on her hips so that Rio's knees slid beneath them, leaving her smooth and full ass angled up like the peak of a mountain.</p><p>The end of the spiral had come at the exact same time Rio had, her moans and cries still loud despite the fact that she had hurled them into the plush cotton of the pillow she had buried her face in.</p><p>Quite thrilled with her efforts, Agatha had given a firm smack to Rio's right cheek before she leaned over to place a kiss softly against her temple. She pulled away and reached for her phone, her eyes wide as she realized what time it was. A loud groan rooted in self-loathing escaped her as she jumped out of bed and began to move in a frenzy so that she could get to class as soon as possible.</p><p>She'd taken a quick shower and dressed herself, double checking that everything was in her bag before she took off. It was strange; her laptop was still inside, but it was in with the top facing the front of the bag, something Agatha almost <i>never </i>did due to the risk of damaging the screen. Maybe she'd done it without realizing. With a shrug, she flipped it around and clipped the fastens on the cover to secure it.</p><p>Even though she was late, Agatha couldn't help but stop and admire the beauty that was her girlfriend in that giant bed. Agatha was lucky, truly, that being with her was the one place Rio seemed to want to be most as of late. She was blessed with the fact that even though she was going to get guff from her students about turning up after lecture was supposed to start, it was because someone she cared deeply for had charmed her into morning sex.</p><p>After the moment of introspection, she made her way back to the bed and knelt on the soft mattress so that she could press a kiss to Rio's cheek, not entirely sure if she had gone back to sleep or not. She got her answer when Rio turned her head and puckered her lips slightly, enough that her demand was clear. Agatha met it with a tender exchange of her mouth against Rio's, one that left them both smiling as she pulled away.</p><p>
<i>"Have a good day, beautiful. I love you."</i>
</p><p>Each and every time, there was that fluttering. It was the understanding that she was loved, the understanding that Rio continued to love her throughout each and every one of her flaws, that left Agatha feeling like she would never touch the ground again.</p><p>
<i>"Me too, Rio. Don't forget to lock up when you leave."</i>
</p><p>Agatha had placed one last kiss to Rio's cheek before she made her way downstairs and then out to the car she had ordered before her shower.</p><p>The moment Agatha clamored through the door to her lecture hall, she was met with a series of "Ooooooooh's" and "You're in troubleeeee, Professor Harkness!es" from the gallery before her and she couldn't help the sheepish grin on her face. She tried to ignore them, occasionally waving a hand dismissively at them while she worked to get set up for class.</p><p>She had made the stupid mistake of plugging the HDMI cord into her laptop before she opened it. When she did, she hadn't really looked at it, still busy with preparing everything else.</p><p>The sudden chorus of exhaled heartbroken "Aw, fuck's" and disappointed groans caused confusion that compelled Agatha's attention to pull toward the screen behind her.</p><p>Displayed there was a projection of the desktop on her computer. The background of that desktop was what had once been her private memory.</p><p>Now, her entire class was staring at her favorite photo of her kissing her girlfriend.</p><p>Rio was, without question, a little shit.</p><p>Agatha was red, but she did not acknowledge it at first. Instead, she busied herself with pulling up the lesson to cover that photo. Her photo. And a very clear statement from Rio to the women in Agatha's class who thought they might have had a shot: They didn't.</p><p>Despite the ridiculous start, Agatha had maintained hope that she could get through the rest of her day without much more turbulence.</p><p>And then, with a half an hour left to her lecture, her phone vibrated on her desk. She glanced down at it, only to see a message from Rio that only visibly read '911.' Instantly, Agatha felt panicked. She glanced up at her students and back down to the phone before she made her choice.</p><p>"Give me just a moment, everyone," she requested softly, grabbing the phone before she tucked into her office. She unlocked it and as the messages loaded in, Agatha realized that the 911 message had only been an attempt to force her into looking at the previous ones.</p><p>The first one read:</p><p>
<i>"I was restless, so I came into work early anyway. My knees just stopped feeling like jello about ten minutes ago."</i>
</p><p>Then, there was another:</p><p>
<i>"I can't stop thinking about you today. Do you need a reason to think about me? I can give you one..."</i>
</p><p>Below that was a photo. It was a photo where Rio's face was out of frame. It was a photo where Rio had pulled up her scrubs. She had pulled them up high enough that the fleshy curves of the undersides of her breast were visible beneath the bottom of her scrub top. Her nipples were still covered, but the entire expanse of her abdomen looked like a landscape Agatha desperately wanted to traverse.</p><p>Right.</p><p>That.</p><p>Instant.</p><p>Even the waist of her scrub bottoms had been tugged down slightly, enough to show that tiny little divot of muscle that ran under it from its origin beneath Rio's navel. In only a blink, Agatha swallowed down the pool of saliva that had gathered in her mouth.</p><p>Fuck this.</p><p>Fuck class.</p><p>Fuck anything that was going to try and stop her from getting to that hospital. She brought up uber, ordered a car and stomped right back out into that lecture hall as she began wildly gathering her things.</p><p>"Class is finished for the day. I have an emergency that I need to tend to," she informed them, nearly shoving her laptop back into her bag with force. There was a hum of confusion amongst her students and her head snapped up to meet it directly.  "Well, get going, then!" she added, a sense of urgency to her tone as they all seemed to understand that time and began to move.</p><p>Agatha locked her office and pulled out her phone as the last of the students filtered out. She was quick in the message she typed, but very to-the-point.</p><p>
<i>"I'm on my way there. It would be advised to have signage that will direct me to the nearest breakroom and I pray that it is anything like the ones on shitty TV dramas because I'd prefer a flat surface that is not a tabletop. You've been warned."</i>
</p><p>She sent it and stowed her phone in her coat pocket right before she took off for the location the car would be meeting her at. There was little relief in the fact that it was waiting for her when she reached the curb. It simmered nothing in her that was feeling starved for her hands on Rio's body. There was no quelling of the raging fire that was burning low in her middle.</p><p>In fact, Rio probably could have heard her footsteps all the way from the pediatrics wing the moment Agatha's flats hit the linoleum in the hospital lobby. She'd stopped at the desk only for direction and was marching her way through that hospital, following the signs that directed her where she needed to go.</p><p>Her long hair was caught in the breeze created by the pace of her stride, blowing behind her as she turned the corner to the sight of the giant blue sign that read 'PEDIATRICS' above the doorway.</p><p>There, leaned over a counter at the nurse's station with the end of a pen in her mouth, was Rio. The moment Agatha crossed the threshold to the department, her head lifted and she was sporting a grin that was bordering on pure madness. The pen was discarded immediately as it fell to the desk with little care. Casually, Rio straightened up and turned in place to face Agatha full-on. That grin did not dim in the slightest.</p><p>Agatha was a train, one that was not slowing down any time soon. She marched up to Rio and wordlessly took hold of her wrist, giving it a gentle tug in a direction that Agatha did not even know would be suited for them. She pulled Rio ahead of her, a loud declaration that she needed to lead the way.</p><p>Agatha clearly did not have any concern to the display she was putting on.</p><p>Rio had known what she was doing the moment she sent that photo. Rio knew this was inevitable.</p><p>Not only had she braved, months later, into returning Agatha's consistent sentiment of lewd photos, but she had done it in the <i>one way</i> that she was fully aware would turn Agatha into a feral animal.</p><p>It had worked.</p><p>If Agatha did not fuck Rio in the next five minutes, she was going to combust.</p><p>Rio understood this and led Agatha directly to a breakroom and made an obvious show of locking the door behind her. Before she could finish turning around, Agatha was moving.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the weight of her body was against Rio's, pinning her back to the door. A hand flew to wrap around Rio's throat and left Agatha's fingers and thumb sunk into the spaces on the inside of Rio's jaw on either side. The move pulled a surprised moan from Rio, but it was swallowed whole with the way Agatha pressed their mouths together with more urgency than she physically felt able to contain.</p><p>Agatha was ferocious in her attack, not hesitating to devour every bit of Rio's mouth she could touch with her tongue. Rio was offering some form of protest in the way of her tongue pushing back, but it had to be apparent to her that Agatha was going to be absolutely driving this interaction and she was going to take anything and everything she wanted unless stopped or told no.</p><p>The hand that wasn't secured around Rio's throat found its way to her skin as it slid beneath the scrub top and traced heavy lines up her side. It lifted higher, moving to palm the entirety of her  breast despite being covered by her bra. Desperately, Agatha gave a strong squeeze at the same time a guttural groan escaped her, leaving it to find refuge deep inside of Rio's lungs as it made the transfer.</p><p>At the sound of that noise, Rio nearly puddled between Agatha's body and the door. She was compliant, she was flexible. She was whatever Agatha wanted her to be right then.</p><p>Kissing Rio like that was great. It felt amazing. It was something Agatha adored doing.</p><p>But it wasn't enough.</p><p>There was a bit of force in the way Agatha pried their mouths apart, but the burning light in her eyes was a clear message that this was only beginning. Wasting only a second, Agatha pulled her body from the way it had pinned Rio's and she glanced over her shoulder to assess the area they now occupied.</p><p>Ah, so it really was like those TV shows.</p><p>There was one lone bunk bed against the left wall.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Agatha took hold of Rio's wrist again and pulled her over toward it, careful in her gentle push to get Rio onto the mattress without smacking her head against the metal piping that supported the top bunk. She was a bit crooked where she landed, but Agatha didn't care. In fact, there was something so inherently Rio about the vision Agatha had from that vantage point.</p><p>Rio the healer who had soothed far more of Agatha than would ever be known.</p><p>Rio the vixen who knew just how fucking sexy she was.</p><p>Rio the lover who had made a call for attention, one that Agatha had answered without a second thought.</p><p>The moment of appreciation came and went and Agatha was on the move. She fit herself on that bed, placing herself over Rio long enough to steal a voracious kiss before she lowered herself to the side of the bed closest to the wall, though they were still overlapping slightly.</p><p>It was a chorus of more teeth, more tongues, more sucking of skin as Agatha tugged down the collar of Rio's scrubs with a hooked finger to expose more to feast upon.</p><p>When their lips met again, Agatha's touch was on the move. She was focused both on the way she nibbled at Rio's bottom lip as well as the way her fingertips began to glide down soft cotton, all the way to the hem of the top. They curled around the material and lifted enough so that her palm could press flat to Rio's abdomen as her fingers burrowed beneath the elastic of her scrub bottoms and the panties beneath it.</p><p>Rio let go of a moan before Agatha's hand ever even made it between her legs. Those legs shifted, opening a bit wider in anticipation for what she knew was coming. Agatha's touch braved lower still. She was precise in the way her pinky and index fingers slid to the inmost corners where Rio's thighs officially ended and her center began. Agatha's two middle fingers ran along the groove between Rio's outer lips, though they did not push inward.</p><p>She didn't need to in order to feel just how wet Rio was. Agatha could have felt that even through her underwear.</p><p>Rio exhaled a sound, one that Agatha thought was supposed to be her name, but it was lost in their kiss. Rio was not satisfied with that, or the way that Agatha was just running her fingers up and down the length of Rio's sex but not making any actual contact with the important parts. She showed this in the way she jerked her head back to rip apart their kiss.</p><p><i>"Agatha, I swear..." </i>Rio tried to warn, but her desperation made the threat laughable.</p><p><i>"Did you think that you could just give me what I've been dying for and I wouldn't want to have my fun in rewarding you for your antics?"</i> Agatha murmured at her, dipping her head to take another lustful kiss.</p><p>At the exact same moment, Agatha's fingers pressed forward into Rio's soaking wet sex. The severity of her arousal caused a truly delighted breath of a laugh to pass from Agatha's throat straight toward Rio's. Rio nearly choked on it, or at least Agatha wanted to think so with the way Rio's breath truly had caught in almost the same second.</p><p>Agatha's fingers dropped, pressing gently into Rio, but not enough to be considered full penetration. It was just toeing the threshold. Instead of barging in, Agatha's touch surfed the waves up, fingertips catching on the crag of her clit. The sensation caused Rio to draw in a sharp breath against Agatha's mouth.</p><p>Agatha wanted to laugh but she was so fucking turned on, there was little else she could give focus to outside of the way she was kissing and touching the woman beneath her.</p><p>Agatha circled that small bundle of nerves for just a moment before her touch was migrating back to where it had started. Carefully, Agatha both bit Rio's upper lip and pressed two fingers inside of her concurrently, sparking a moan that was probably a little too loud for where they were.</p><p>Not even a second later, Rio's pager started to sound from her hip.</p><p>No! Absolutely not!</p><p>In harmony, they both let out displeased groans and Agatha's head dropped, her forehead landing on Rio's chin as she begrudgingly withdrew her hand but was careful to set the heel of it on her own hip, sticky fingers hovering aimlessly in the air. She tried to hide her disappointment as Rio began to roll out of the bed, but she couldn't control the way it had painted itself in her expression.</p><p>Agatha moved to lay on her back as she watched Rio pace toward a drawer from which she pulled out a wet wipe. She used it to clean herself up and tossed it in the trash can before she made her way back toward the bunk, leaning over to place a quick kiss to Agatha's lips.</p><p>"I'll be back ASAP," she promised. When she pulled back, she was wearing a smirk that did not help alleviate the pulsing between Agatha's legs. "I love you, you horny idiot."</p><p>Agatha grinned, her blue eyes softening.</p><p>"Me too, Doctor Idiot who brought this on herself," Agatha returned as she tipped her head to watch Rio disappear through the door.</p><p>Agatha still felt like she was about to catch fire to the entire breakroom, even more so as she realized that she still had her fucking coat on. That was remedied in a beat as she stripped it off and tossed it, managing to hand it over the back of a nearby chair. She settled back into the bed beneath her, head propped up on the pillow as she pulled her phone out.</p><p>Instantly, she brought up that damn picture again. She was so frustrated in the explicitly sexual way and the longer she looked at that photo, the less she cared about whether or not someone might try to come in while she was waiting for Rio's return.</p><p>Her hand dropped to the button on her jeans and worked it free to allow enough space for her fingers to slide inside and beneath the fabric of her underwear. Her touch on her own body was nowhere near as taunting as it was when on Rio's skin. Instead, Agatha knew what she needed and she wasted no time in taking it.</p><p>Agatha had kept quiet, somehow, throughout the couple of minutes it had taken her to find the orgasm she'd been hoping to find by fucking her doctor girlfriend in a hospital while she wore her scrubs. It was nowhere the same, but it pleased her well enough.</p><p>There was no distracting her busy mind afterward, no matter what videos she scrolled or what articles she tried to read. It had been forty-five minutes by the time Agatha pulled up her Kindle app and resumed a story she hadn't read in weeks.</p><p>No less than twenty paragraphs in, her hand had dropped and the phone screen rested against the fabric of her flannel as she dozed off.</p><p>She was not sure just how long she'd been asleep when a gentle jostling brought her to consciousness. Slowly, she forced her eyes open to see Rio bent over at the waist, a warm smile curling her lips.</p><p>"Let's go home," she suggested, her voice sweet like honey.</p><p>Agatha reached up with one hand to dig a knuckle into a closed eye. "What time is it?"</p><p>"Five-thirty. The last few hours have been... a series of emergencies, but I am off the clock now and I would very much like it if we can go back to yours and climb in that big bed and pick up where we left off." Rio's voice was smooth, but it was also a little more sultry than Agatha had initially been able to pick up on in her sleepiness. By the time Rio had finished speaking, though, it had been apparent.</p><p>That lust was flaring right back up in Agatha's stomach and a grin found her face as she pushed herself up so that she could roll out of the bed and put her coat back on. Rio did not hesitate to reach for Agatha's hand as they made their way through the hospital to an awaiting ride back to Agatha's townhome.</p><p>The moment they made it inside and shed their coats and shoes, Agatha glanced toward the kitchen.</p><p>"Should I grab the bourbon?" Agatha posed, but Rio was already pulling her toward the stairs. "Oh! No bourbon, got it!" She couldn't help but tack on, the snark thick in her words as they tore up those wooden steps.</p><p>Rio had managed to drag her all the way through the house until they were at the edge of Rio's side of the bed, the backs of Agatha's thighs pressed to the mattress. The moment her hands made a move for her scrub top, a panicked grip from Agatha formed around her hands.</p><p><i>"Nuh-uh," </i>Agatha nearly gasped. <i>"Those stay on."</i></p><p>Rio's brow wrinkled in confusion. How the hell was that supposed to work?</p><p>There was no answer provided to Rio's silent question and instead, Agatha began to strip the flannel over her head, tossing it away unceremoniously before her hands flew to her back to rid herself of the nuisance that was her bra. While Rio stood there still processing, she shed her pants and soaked underwear, too. She kicked them away and turned her attention back to Rio.</p><p>Hungry blues swept over her from head to toe. Tentatively, Agatha raised a hand, catching the hem of the scrub top between her fingers as she gave it a gentle lift, ravaging the scape of Rio's abs with her gaze.</p><p><i>"Fuck," </i>Agatha hissed, licking her lips. When she looked back up, Rio was smirking.</p><p>It was that same sinister, wicked smirk.</p><p><i>"All that talk and you're still on your feet?" </i>Rio taunted in a croon that sheeted Agatha's bare skin in goosebumps. Immediately, she was sliding back onto the bed, though she propped herself up against the pillows and turned her famished gaze on Rio. She gave her thigh a pat of command and Rio heard it.</p><p>The way she slid onto Agatha's lap left Agatha's heart hammering somewhere mid-throat. One of Rio's hands landed on Agatha's shoulder and the other had the audacity to tuck into the elastic band of her scrubs. In a flash, Agatha moved to sit up to stop her, but she was met with force in the form of Rio's hand holding her in place.</p><p>Wild eyes raised to find that same smirk, only deeper and darker as it stretched across Rio's lips.</p><p>Rio had seen something. It was something Agatha had tried to mask. It was something Agatha had tried to continue hiding from even herself.</p><p>The power Rio had created in sending that photo wasn't just power.</p><p>It was a sense of control.</p><p>And Agatha was dangerously close to giving up her own.</p><p>Rio's hand stilled, though it remained tucked into the waist of her bottoms, their eyes locking. That smirk was not going anywhere as Rio silently sat there and read Agatha like a goddamn book.</p><p><i>"Tell me,"</i> Rio beguiled, her touch on Agatha's shoulder tightening slightly, her palm pressing a little harder. <i>"What do you really want, Agatha?"</i></p><p>For a split second, there was panic. There was a flicker of anxiety because Agatha knew <i>exactly </i>what it was she wanted.</p><p>She wanted Rio, in those damn scrubs, to wreck every inch of her life and body.</p><p>The words to state as such were not forming in the way Agatha wanted them to. Instead, her head turned to peer at Rio's hand in its firm hold on her shoulder. Slowly, she lifted a hand of her own to wrap around Rio's wrist in quiet indication that she wanted it moved. Reluctantly, Rio obliged and lifted the touch. Agatha turned back to meet her gaze as she repositioned Rio's touch.</p><p>Her hold loosened from Rio's wrist and moved to canvas the back of her hand as she placed it to her throat, applying gentle pressure to Rio's thumbs and fingertips in very specific spots against the flesh of her neck. The look in Rio's eyes told Agatha that she was fully aware of what was being asked, but also the weight that came with it. However, when had Rio ever let Agatha make silent demands?</p><p><i>"That's not an answer, Agatha,"</i> Rio admonished, rocking her hips down into Agatha's lap as if to add encouragement.</p><p>Agatha's brow pinched slightly and she simply pressed harder at Rio's hand. All this managed to do was cause Rio to lean forward, her lips a breath away from Agatha's.</p><p>
<i>"Come on, my love. Use those big girl words."</i>
</p><p>Agatha felt it as her heart stumbled over beats in her chestin a way that it fell out of time with the pounding that was happening between her legs. Rio was asking her to admit the impossible and Agatha was going to do every single thing she could to talk her way around it.</p><p><i>"Rio..."</i> Agatha whimpered, though she licked her lips again.</p><p><i>"Tell me what you want, pretty girl," </i>Rio nearly begged, though Agatha did not miss the way her grip flexed into the sides of her throat.</p><p><i>"I want you to fucking ruin me,"</i> Agatha pleaded, unable to keep from closing the space between them with a needy kiss. Rio only allowed it to last a moment before she used the hold on Agatha's neck to press her back.</p><p>The devious look that was stitched into every inch of Rio's expression melted Agatha from the inside out like a hot ball of lead dropped right in her middle.</p><p>
<i>"Getting warmer. Some examples?"</i>
</p><p>Agatha was already panting and she was only halfway over the edge. Rio was still pushing, still needing to hear Agatha truly release her hold on the control that she held near and dear. It wasn't a power play in the way that Rio was going to get anything more than utter sexual satisfaction out of this, but it was still a very momentous thing to be happening within their dynamic.</p><p>The self-doubt started to creep into Agatha's gaze, but Rio saw it and pressed Agatha back a little further by the hold she had below her chin.</p><p><i>"You can do it, Agatha. You can tell me. It'll help me understand what to do better," </i>Rio told her and oddly enough, her tone was still husky and deep, but it was laced with care and concern. It was coated in Rio's genuine desire to please Agatha.</p><p>Agatha tapped Rio's wrist with two fingers. <i>"Good start," </i>she whispered, gaze never once leaving Rio's face.</p><p><i>"And?" </i>Rio pressed, sensing there was more. In fact, she was wanting it.</p><p><i>"And..."</i> Agatha managed, eyes dropping to Rio's body before they swept back up and met her evenly. <i>"I want you to wear the strap this time."</i></p><p>Rio's dark eyes were instantly wide open and the shock was apparent as her jaw dropped. Perhaps she had realized that the tides were turning and Agatha was relinquishing a hold on the biggest part of who she was as a person, but she clearly had not realized just how much of that hold she was actually giving up.</p><p><i>"You... you want that?" </i>Rio returned in question, clearly caught off guard by the demand.</p><p>Agatha nodded, but there was a caveat.</p><p>
<i>"The only condition is that the scrubs stay on. You can put it on over them."</i>
</p><p>If Agatha had thought Rio looked surprised before, the sheer shock that wrote itself on her face was an absolute delight for Agatha to behold. The moment it settled in the root of Rio's brain, a wicked smirk found her lips again.</p><p><i>"I guess I'll be right back then,"</i> Rio mused, stealing a hot and demanding kiss from Agatha's lips. She swung her leg over to climb off of the bed, making her way with ease over to the closet, which she disappeared into. It only took her a few moments that left Agatha's hand fighting to remain stationed on her stomach for her to reappear in the doorway.</p><p>There Rio stood, harnessed up over the fabric of her scrubs in a way that was probably not the most comfortable, but she looked eager to be put to work. She moved over toward the side of the bed at the same time she was palming some of the lube she had also taken when she had been in the closet. She set the bottle down and knelt onto the bed, making a very clear show of applying it to the length of the shaft.</p><p>Agatha's entire focus was on Rio, on the way her hand seemed to glide and caress an appendage she could not actually feel, even if the slight twitching of muscles in her leg made it seem otherwise.</p><p>Rio pinned Agatha with a hot stare, teeth digging into her bottom lip before she offered her command.</p><p><i>"Lay down,"</i> Rio instructed and Agatha actually listened without a word of defiance.</p><p>Rio was quick to move and Agatha never let her focus waver. She could feel the anticipation, but she did not feel it morph into anxiety as she had thought it might. In fact, when Rio shifted and pushed Agatha's legs apart, Agatha was <i>ready.</i></p><p>It was never instant gratification with Rio, though.</p><p>Instead, Rio sat on her heels and reached forward, her touch heavy and present as it slid up Agatha's slick core that was now exposed from the way her legs were positioned. Rio's fingertips grazed and circled Agatha's clit for a moment of prolonged teasing.</p><p>The moment Rio leaned over Agatha's body to place kisses between her breasts, she also pressed two fingers into Agatha's tight sex, causing a squeal that reverberated into a deep moan. Agatha's hand flew to the back of Rio's head, twisting into locks of hair as her hips lifted, seeking more.</p><p>Rio was willing to offer as much, but it was incremental and not nearly enough. Agatha communicated this by her constant attempts to adjust her position to feel Rio deeper inside of her.</p><p>What she got instead was the removal of Rio's touch, and she immediately let it be known how much she did not like this by the way she jerked on the handful of hair she had in her grasp.</p><p><i>"Patience, my love,"</i> Rio cooed at her, deliberately licking a line up the center of Agatha's chest, right between her breasts. It did not take her long to start moving, though. Rio was shifting, pushing herself up so that she could crawl over Agatha, her gaze hot and hungry.</p><p>After only a brief pause where Agatha could tell that Rio was silently checking in with her, Rio moved a cautious hand and secured it to Agatha's throat as it had been not that long ago, careful in the placement of her fingers. With her free hand, Rio reached down to hook her grip beneath Agatha's thigh so that she could push it up. It was high enough that Rio could pin it with her shoulder, but only for the moment she needed that hand as a guide.</p><p>It dropped again, slender fingers wrapping around the dildo in a way that allowed assistance as she sank it into Agatha's core. At the initial penetration, Agatha gasped first and then released a moan that was verging on primal. The moment she was able, her grip locked around Agatha's calf for leverage, Agatha's other leg tilted off to the side, open.</p><p>Agatha, there beneath Rio, felt like she had transcended space and time.</p><p>This woman, this insanely beautiful and capable woman, was proving to Agatha exactly why this was the safest she could be in this situation. She was making Agatha see why she never would have made this decision with anyone else.</p><p>She could feel the stretch immediately and while it was foreign to her, it was not something she hated. In fact, feeling as Rio sank deeper inside of her as she looked up at her with that struck look on her face, Agatha was desperate for more. The only way to make that clear, she knew, was to state as much.</p><p><i>"Fuck me until I can't think,"</i> Agatha growled at her, a hand landing to twist up in the scrub top as she yanked on it, demanding closer proximity.</p><p>Rio answered by tightening her grasp around Agatha's throat, pulling a sputtered moan from deep within it. As it tightened once more, her hips began to find a steady rhythm that had been slow at first but picked up pace after only a couple of thrusts. Each time their hips met, Agatha tried to bite back the moans and cries, but it seemed futile.</p><p>She was not normally the type to make so much ruckus in bed, but then again, she was not normally the type to let hot doctors strap her down while wearing scrubs, either.</p><p>There was something about the sight of Rio there above her, that fluid movement of her hips as she let her instincts take over, it was making Agatha feel insane. Sure, she was overtaken by the lust and the passion, but Rio was a goddess as she worked that dildo like it were actually attached to her body. She knew how to move in every right way, knew how to adjust Agatha's leg in her grasp for better access.</p><p>It was everything Agatha had asked for, but she was insatiable. She was also, apparently, a bit of a brat.</p><p><i>"Is that all you've got, big boy?" </i>she managed through the tight grip pressing into her trachea.</p><p>This did exactly what she wanted it to. Rio's pace nearly doubled and she let loose a deep growl that pushed Agatha right to that edge.</p><p><i>"Do that again," </i>Agatha nearly choked at the same time Rio's hand pressed even harder, causing a sudden light-headedness to strike her. Though there wasn't even the slightest hiccup in her motions, Rio managed to lean down, biting roughly at Agatha's bottom lip as she exhaled another low and feral growl.</p><p>That one did it.</p><p>Agatha shouted, at first, but then released a moan so pleasured and loud that Rio was certain everyone in the community had heard it. She had stilled, but her hips were left flush against Agatha's, leaving her entirely filled as she rode those waves of her orgasm around Rio's girth inside of her.</p><p>Her eyes had rolled back into her head in a way that had not allowed her to see the giddy joy that was written all over Rio as she released her grip on Agatha's neck. Her other hand kept its hold on Agatha's leg until the point where it dropped to the bed, thigh settling against Rio's clothed hip.</p><p><i>"F-fuck,"</i> Agatha managed as Rio moved to pull her hips back enough that the dildo came free and she could adjust herself to clamor to Agatha's side. For as wild as that had been, Rio did not seem to hesitate as she reached up to brush some of Agatha's long bangs back out of her face. She also did not seem to second guess the several kisses she placed across Agatha's face before their lips met in a show of Rio's appreciation.</p><p><i>"And how was that?"</i> Rio murmured enticingly against Agatha's lips.</p><p><i>"Fantastic as long as you tell me I get that for the next twelve hours," </i>Agatha returned through the way her chest was still heaving and her eyes were still shut.</p><p><i>"Twelve hours?" </i>Rio asked back, laughing through her incredulity.</p><p>
<i>"If I don't black out before then, then yes. Twelve hours."</i>
</p><p>Agatha was aware that Rio knew that she did not have the ability to fuck Agatha for the next twelve hours, but Rio could certainly put her foot on the gas until it ran out.</p><p>And with certainty, she did.</p><p>Agatha had let Rio handle her with intent and force for hours, bending her over the dresser, pinning her to the wall with a leg hiked up, throwing her on the bed and dragging her to the edge of it while Rio used a new leverage gained from being on her feet.</p><p>Agatha had lost her mouthiness sometime near the end of the fourth round.</p><p>By the fifth, Rio was certain she was close to accomplishing the mission she had been tasked with. She'd commanded Agatha to her knees, but the moment Agatha realized what she wanted, she was nearly flying off of the bed -- a feat given just how many time she had come at that point -- and grabbed the full-length mirror from the back corner.</p><p>Rio watched, puzzled, as Agatha moved back to the bed and hoisted it up to set it at the head of the bed, turned on its side.</p><p>Agatha wanted to watch.</p><p>Agatha knew what she was doing, and the moment she turned to look at Rio over her shoulder, the grin she found on Rio's face was so damn alluring that Agatha could hardly stand it.</p><p><i>"When you're fucking me from behind, I really need to you lift up that top like you did in the picture,"</i> Agatha instructed, her voice hoarse from the amount of noise she had been making throughout the course of the night. <i>"Underboob and all," </i>she added before she turned to face forward, beaming at her own reflection in the mirror.</p><p>As one of Rio's hands found her hip and the other aided her ability to sink right back into Agatha again, her own eyes dropped to the length of mirror that was now splayed across the headboard. Agatha was watching her, watching every single move she was making.</p><p>Agatha could feel as Rio's hold on her hip began to move, sliding up her back so that she could wrap it in Agatha's hair. The moment Agatha's head tilted back, she had kept her eyes on Rio's reflection and let out a low rumble the moment Rio's thumb hooked into the fabric of the top and slid it up, pinning it between her breasts.</p><p>As Agatha drank in the way Rio's abs shifted and flexed with each slam of her hips, she knew she was only a few seconds away from coming once again. Rio sensed this and stopped.</p><p><i>"No! Don't stop!"</i> Agatha cried, shoving her hips back along the length inside of her, but Rio was already moving.</p><p>The moment Agatha felt Rio's fingers interlock around her throat from behind, she didn't even need the next several thrusts that Rio had to offer as she pulled back on Agatha by way of that hold.</p><p>No, she hadn't needed it, but it seemed to intensify the massive orgasm that had shot through every single nerve of her body anyway. Rio kept going, though. She was still thrusting, still slamming their hips together. Blindly, Agatha reached back behind her to give the limpest shove at Rio's hip, but it did nothing.</p><p><i>"Rio... R-Rio, I c-can't..."</i> Agatha attempted, but she could hear the lack of conviction in her own words.</p><p><i>"You can, my love," </i>Rio corrected, still keeping the pace she had been maintaining to that point.</p><p>Rio wasn't restricting her airflow, but Agatha still felt like she was on the verge of passing out the deeper Rio seemed to sink into her.</p><p>Rio shifted, just slightly, in a way that lifted her up just enough that it created a newly workable angle for her to explore. Agatha was able to sense this immediately and while her vision was beginning to white-out, she fought to hold on a little longer, knowing what she was on the verge on and yet, having no idea at the same time.</p><p>Rio's palms on the side of her neck applied a little more pressure, but Agatha didn't miss the breathless declaration Rio dumped into the night.</p><p>
<i>"I fucking love you, Agatha, Jesus Christ."</i>
</p><p>The moment Rio's words landed in Agatha's ears, a few things happened:</p><p>First, Agatha came.</p><p>Concurrently, the thrust that had done it apparently slammed right into her g-spot.</p><p>As a result, the front of Rio's scrub pants immediately became soaked with Agatha's ejaculation. Before she could even make a comment about it, Agatha collapsed into the pillow causing the appendage between Rio's legs to drop, hanging between them.</p><p>Agatha missed every bit of Rio's boasting as she breathed it over the skin of Agatha's back through soft kisses. She had missed the way Rio's hands roamed her body and reveled in the feel of her skin. She had even missed the 'I love you,' Rio had managed just before she realized that Agatha was asleep.</p><p>That meant she missed the way Rio had kissed her so softly and called her the woman of her dreams, too.</p><p>Hours later, Agatha stirred, not entirely aware of where she was or what year it was. When she regained the ability to open her eyes, she managed to do so with some effort. The room was mostly dark, but there was the smallest bit of light coming from the little lamp on her desk.</p><p>A now naked Rio was perched in the chair with her knees up. She was busy with the way she was folding cheese into squares and placing them onto club crackers, making little sandwiches that she would unceremoniously shove into her mouth before repeating the process.</p><p><i>"Never a box of crackers safe in this house,"</i> Agatha mused, though her voice was rough as a result of her overexertion throughout the evening.</p><p>The moment Rio looked at her, she absolutely lit up.</p><p>
<i>"I didn't want to make anything to actually eat until you woke up. I knew you'd be starving. I mean, I hoped you would be after all of that. I prepped some of the cauliflower to roast and saw those Morning Star nuggets. Figured we could have a late night feast."</i>
</p><p>The more Rio talked, the more it settled into Agatha's chest.</p><p>She loved Rio. She could admit it to herself. For right now, that was as far as she was going to get.</p><p>
<i>"I can come down and help you. Would probably be smart for the way I need to chug three bottles of water. What time even is it?"</i>
</p><p>Rio's grin did not waver. <i>"Two-thirty." </i>She wrapped up the rest of the crackers and popped the last square of cheese into her mouth before she got to her feet.</p><p>As Agatha began to shift, pushing herself up, her brow knit tightly at the feeling of the sheets beneath her.</p><p><i>"Why is the bed wet?" </i>she questioned, the confusion clear in her voice.</p><p><i>"Oh,"</i> Rio responded casually as she pulled one of Agatha's t-shirts over her head. <i>"That's a conversation you get to have with your body. And a mental image I will be touching myself to for weeks."</i></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha was not a religious woman.</p><p>She didn't worship, she didn't pray.</p><p>Agatha, for most of her life, had even lacked faith but on a much grander scale than sinking it into deities. She'd once possessed faith in herself, but that had slipped from her grasp each passing day that she'd sat at her son's bedside as he wandered farther from her in his sickness.</p><p>It was more than startling to realize, as Rio pushed a piece of chicken nugget into Agatha's mouth through a fit of laughter, that Agatha had faith in Rio.</p><p>She had faith that Rio meant it when she said she loved her. She had faith that Rio's clearly amused laughter as she tried to shut Agatha up with food came from a place Rio might like to stay forever. She had faith that if there were ever a person in the whole world that Agatha was meant to find, it was Rio.</p><p>Agatha had met hundreds of people in her life, on many different soils, living their very individual lives. Agatha had tangled with many of those people in more than questionable ways, but never emotionally. She had spent so, so long learning how to compartmentalize away her feelings, how to sort them into boxes that she could then kick to the deepest recesses of her mind.</p><p>It was a simple task for her to shut the world out, to not let anyone see who she actually was. It was why her office was very bare in comparison to some of her colleagues, why she chose to let students flirt with her knowing that she would never intentionally sleep with them (the three beneath her belt were complete accidents -- it happened once the first summer and twice the second -- and she'd been mortified to see those faces on the first day). It was why she moved about those often dreary Boston streets without someone to walk beside her.</p><p>But now, when Agatha walked down Charles St to window gaze at things she didn't actually need, it was with her hand snugly in Rio's grasp while she looked over Agatha's shoulder and often made comments about the practicality of whatever was displayed in the window. Most of the time, she was never wrong, but often Agatha found herself wanting to ask if Rio had something to say about everything. It was a pointless question; Agatha didn't actually care that Rio talked so much. Actually, she had always quite liked it.</p><p>From the first moment Agatha had met Rio, she had loved the sound of her voice.</p><p>In the four months since, Agatha had never stopped loving the sound of Rio's voice.</p><p>In moments like the one where Agatha answered Rio's call a little after six that Agatha still loved the sound of her voice, but her chest squeezed at the tone Rio chose to use.</p><p>"Hey, are you busy?" Rio asked instantly. Her directness, the words she was selecting, her tone? Agatha could feel in her chest as her heart picked up its pace, beating a little harder.</p><p>"No, I just got home. We had a staff meeting that ran over. Is everything okay?" Agatha posed gently, reaching forward from her place in front of the counter to flip on the electric kettle.</p><p>"Yeah, of course," Rio returned quickly, but something about it didn't land quite right as it registered with Agatha. Before she could push, Rio was speaking again. "Do you think you can come over? I had to come home for something, which is why I didn't message or stop by. But I --"</p><p>"Rio," Agatha soothed, at the same time flipping the kettle back off. This was likely a bad day. This was likely Rio having to deal with something that she was not fully aware of how to deal with. She needed soothing, but in her state of disarray, she was unable to ask for it. "Yes, babe. I can come over. Just let me get changed and I'll head right over. Give me twenty or so, traffic depending."</p><p>"Okay," Rio responded. She was quiet a moment, but she had not said anything else. As Agatha went to fill the silence, Rio finally spoke up. "Agatha?"</p><p>"Yeah, Rio?"</p><p>"I love you."</p><p>Agatha softened instantaneously, her posture slacking as her eyes slid shut. If there was ever a time she should have said it back, it was right then. It was in that moment, because of what she could hear over those words. It wasn't a message that could be conveyed in any dialect. It was an understanding between them that when things were hard, they were there to support one another.</p><p>"Me too, baby. I'll be there in a jif."</p><p>At this, Rio laughed. It was gentle, it was light, but it was still a laugh.</p><p>"Bye, Agatha."</p><p>The moment the call disconnected, Agatha was a blizzard of motion. She was ordering a ride, changing her clothes and brushing her hair out within a matter of minutes. In the midst of all the motion, Agatha had been actively trying to drive her mind away from the conversation they'd just had. There was something in it that felt... off. It wasn't even necessarily that something was different, but there was something about it that hadn't felt... normal, at least what normal could be when it came to the two of them.</p><p>To keep her mind occupied on the short ride over, Agatha had found herself scrolling through her photos. It was comical, really. There were photos of herself and Rio together, both in bed and out in the city. Rio had developed quite the insistence that they take more photos, that they give themselves tangible memories to hold onto. There were photos she had taken of Rio and ones Rio had sent her of herself in the more beautiful and tender moments. There were photos of her own chest in various forms of undress.</p><p>There was also a smattering of ones Rio had gotten bold enough to send her after the hospital incident, though notably none of the others were where she was wearing scrubs. She had apparently learned her lesson on that one, or at least the part of the lesson where she knew Agatha would turn up at the hospital with a lack of environmental awareness and want to fuck her endlessly.</p><p>Things had been... peaceful the last month or so. More often than not, they spent some part of their evenings together and while there was still the smallest little gnat flying around Agatha's mind in regard to that phone call, her going to Rio's was not out of the ordinary, even if it had been a little while since it had happened.</p><p>As Agatha reached the top of the front steps, she unhooked her carabiner from her belt loop and found the right key -- the one Rio had presented her with two days after she'd given Rio a key to her own place -- before she placed it in the lock and turned. The moment she was inside, she was shutting the door and kicking her shoes off at the same time.</p><p>For just a moment, Agatha just stopped and looked around. It had been a little bit of time, but Rio's condo still felt as welcoming and warm as it always had. The ground floor was obviously empty, so Agatha began her ascent. She paused on the second floor and saw that the door to the greenhouse was closed, which led her to the belief that Rio was likely in her bedroom.</p><p>She climbed the last stairs and turned down the hall, pacing over into the empty doorway. Agatha's eyes lifted and instantly took in the sight of Rio, hunched over the open laptop in front of her, her brow pinched tight in focus. She was so absorbed in what she was looking at that she did not notice Agatha's arrival.</p><p>"Hi, beautiful," Agatha cooed softly, but it still caused Rio's head to snap up, the alarm in her eyes lasting only a moment before it melted away.</p><p>"Hi, my love," she greeted back as she reached forward to shut the laptop so she could push it aside.</p><p>Agatha had started to step into the room, but something caught her eye on the wall above the bed, something she hadn't noticed immediately because of her focus always falling to the woman in that bed.</p><p>It was a 30x45 canvas, mostly white. In charcoal, drawn very accurately with an immense attention to detail, was a replica of the first photo Agatha had ever sent Rio of her chest, the one that had made Rio drop her phone into her coffee.</p><p>If Agatha had been looking at that moment on a phone, over a cup of coffee, she surely would have dropped it, too.</p><p>"Rio..." Agatha attempted, slowly pacing toward the bed. Rio followed her gaze for a moment, but the indifference there was jarring.</p><p>"Oh, that's been there for a week. We just haven't made it this way since I put it up," she offered, not a trace of her usual smart-aleck tone to be found.</p><p>Seeing the artwork had been enough to make Agatha want to take off her clothes. What Rio said next made her feel as if they had been melted onto her skin.</p><p>"That isn't why I asked you to come over."</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>Agatha didn't like that. She did not like it one bit. In fact, she quickly realized that she hated that string of words said in that cadence with that inflection.</p><p>She was still mid-journey and knew she could not stop, so she pressed herself forward until she could place herself atop the mattress. Her gaze dropped to the way that Rio was picking at her cuticles and the sight caused her to shift further onto the bed so that she could reach for the hands of her lover, pulling them into her own.</p><p>"What's going on, Rio?" Agatha asked her calmly, but between the slight tremble in her hands and that look in her eyes as she finally looked up at Agatha, it was apparent that Rio was spiraling.</p><p>"There are... Things that I tend to keep to myself in relationships," Rio admitted, though she did actively turn her hands in Agatha's so that her fingers could wrap around them, holding them intently. "And it's just... a defense mechanism. I try to wait at least a year before I have an active conversation about my parents and my abuelo because no one likes severe emotional sob stories in the honeymoon phase."</p><p>As if she realized what she was saying, Rio's lips turned down at the corners and her eyes glassed over slightly. Agatha took no offense to it, really. The truth was, if Rio hadn't asked, it was likely Agatha would have never brought up Nicky.  Agatha just hadn't known the right questions to ask in this instance. She was right there to hear the answers, though.</p><p>"You saw the photo downstairs," Rio pointed out, and Agatha gave a gentle nod in response. "About a month later, there was a boating accident and... I lost them. That photo is my last memory I have of them that I can still hold in my hand." She offered a tight smile while she tried to keep herself composed and Agatha simply gave a gentle squeeze of her hands to show her support.</p><p>"I was going to be placed in foster care," Rio disclosed, her eyes dropping to their hands. "And I had a very amazing abuelo who lived in Iberville, Louisiana that was absolutely not going to let that happen. It was... a process, but he adopted me and raised me until he passed when I was nineteen." Slowly, Rio's head lifted and Agatha found herself staring into honey eyes that were darker than normal. "I grew up on his sugarcane farm for a few years before he moved us back to Miami because he felt it was important I stay close to the memory of them. When he died, too, he... he left me everything. In his will, he told me to sell the farm to the highest bidder and build the best life I could for myself. And... I did. I used the money to put myself through med school, used it to move to this city. I used it to buy this stupidly large house that I don't really need because I can fill every room with the things I <i>do</i> need."</p><p>Rio was beginning to ramble, but Agatha gave another firm squeeze of her hands to signify that it was okay.</p><p>"What do you need right now, Rio?" Agatha asked her in a voice that barely made it above a whisper.</p><p>At this, Rio's eyes began to water.</p><p>"I need you to understand..." Rio choked, pressing her lips together right after to try and fortify the dam wall that was about to break apart.</p><p>"Then help me understand, baby. Just... talk to me."</p><p>Rio pulled one of her hands up to wipe away the tears that had not yet fallen before she let it drop back down to Agatha's, fingers gripping tightly once contact was established.</p><p>"Yesterday... There was a case that I was assigned to. She's... God, she's five. She was brought in with a police escort and a social worker. She has three broken bones in her hand and... The x-rays show several other breaks that have not healed properly, likely because she was never brought in for treatment."</p><p>Agatha's heart was hardly beating the longer Rio went on. She wasn't even trying to see where this conversation was going because she was too cemented to the idea that there were people in the world who could be so horrible to children, the tiniest people who could not defend themselves.</p><p>"It's a foster situation. She's been in the system her whole life and from the looks of it, she's just been handed off from abuser to abuser. She's fucking <i>five</i> and has broken more bones than I have in my entire life!" Rio's voice had grown louder, more distraught. In a move that was not thought out, Agatha reached up to cradle Rio's cheek, slowly guiding her attention back to Agatha's warm gaze. "I... When the social worker told me about her, she told me that her name was Stephanie... But if I called her anything other than Stevie, she absolutely would not engage. She was right."</p><p>Rio's head dropped again and a sad and sardonic smile filled her face, something that actually pained Agatha.</p><p>"I sat with her yesterday for a little while after she woke up from surgery. She asked me if I could draw the flower in my hair on her cast. I did, obviously. She asked me if I played Fortnite and Roblox. I did not have the heart to tell her that I have no idea what either of those things mean, but I'm sort of sure that they're video games."</p><p>Agatha breathed a gentle chuckle, dropping her hand from Rio's face to instead trace light lines along her forearm.</p><p>"Before I left, she..." Rio choked on her words, gripping hard at Agatha's hand that remained in her grasp. "She made me promise I would come back."</p><p>"Oh, honey..." Agatha managed softly just before she began to move so that she could place herself next to Rio and pull her into her arms.</p><p>"When I... When I talked to the social worker this morning, she told me that when we release her... Which may be a little while due to the attempts to correct other issues that were found during testing... She's going back into the system. She's going right back into a place that put her in my care. And I... I can't help but wonder how long it will be before she's coming through my door again." Rio was managing to keep going through minimal tears, but Agatha still was not quite able to sense where this was going.</p><p>Agatha knew that Rio's job was hard, but this was the first time Rio had ever brought something home like this. It was reminiscent of the day Agatha had kept her from being hit by that car, when her friends' safety had been in question. But this was a child Rio had cared for in terms strictly related to her job. Or so Agatha had thought.</p><p>"Today, we spent some time coloring and watching Bluey, which she informed me is her favorite. She lit up when I snuck her a Reese cup from the vending machine and thanked me for it about eight times in twenty minutes. She also threw a cup of applesauce at the nurse because it was strawberry flavored and she <i>hates</i> strawberries. So... the knowledge that she's not as fond of the others on the floor as she is me was absolutely not lost on me when she asked me the same question tonight that she did last night."</p><p>At this, Rio took a steadying breath and Agatha loosened her hold as she felt her move to sit up, not realizing that Rio was pulling away in each and every sense imaginable.</p><p>"I had a very at-length conversation with the social worker today," Rio admitted, though she was looking down again, avoiding looking at Agatha. It was driving Agatha insane.</p><p>"Yeah?" Agatha managed back, still trying to find the trail Rio was seemingly laying for her.</p><p>"Yeah... And I..." Rio stopped herself and realized that she owed Agatha more, apparently, because she shifted so that they were facing each other, Rio off to Agatha's side by her knees. Slowly, Rio raised those beautiful eyes and Agatha saw something new there.</p><p>Finality.</p><p>"I am making a very personal choice to start the process of adopting Stevie. I am making this choice as I sit here and look you in the eyes knowing that you aren't ready for something of that magnitude, yet. I am making that choice with the full awareness that you have a choice, here, too." The thing that Agatha was finding she hated most about listening to Rio say these things was that she had chosen not to hold Agatha's hand as she said them. Agatha simply stared at her, feeling as a massive boulder began to form in her throat.</p><p>"Your choice is yours alone, but... There are options. I <i>want</i> you to do this with me, to help me raise this wild little girl who has <i>so much</i> of your fire in her without even having met you. I want to start a family with you in a way that I never would have stated so boldly under different circumstances. But..." Rio heistated, her eyes dropping down to Agatha's hands in her lap as they nervously picked at her nails. "I also know who you are, and what you have been through. I know the things that have been taken from you and the way you have suffered since. And that is why I won't ask you."</p><p>Agatha felt like a white-hot ray of light had been shot through her chest, dissolving her into nothing but atoms. It was, in its totality, a lot to digest, but it said so many things at once. This was a testament to who Rio was in the very essence of her core. It was her nurturing personality taking over in a situation that needed to be handled. Agatha was fully aware that Rio understood what she was doing and what she was saying and that it might not have seemed sane, but it was coming from a place of passion and love.</p><p>Rio had found one love in those hospital walls. Finding another, Agatha realized, meant enough to Rio that she could not let the moment pass her by and watch as an innocent child was subjected to the cruel fate of the world.</p><p>Rio would never ask her to join her in such a venture. What Rio would do instead, was lay the option right at Agatha's feet and let her be the one to decide what was best for the life she wanted to be living.</p><p>Finally, Rio looked at her, <i>really </i>looked at her.</p><p>"I love you, Agatha, and I know you know that. But I... I am telling you this, already having a good idea of what's going to happen. And I want you to know that every reason you have for the choice you make is valid and I respect them. I'm not sitting here trying to chase you off or make you think for even a second that my feelings for you aren't genuine. However... It's just life, isn't it? We sacrifice things we love to be better people... And I... I just..." The more she tried to explain, the faster Rio was falling apart and Agatha could feel her own resolve crumbling.</p><p>That crumbling kickstarted a feeling Agatha had not felt in a long while.</p><p>Agatha felt like she needed to run.</p><p>"It's okay, Rio," Agatha tried to soothe in the same way she tried to keep any sense of alarm from gracing her features.</p><p>"Doing the right thing is, yes. That is okay. But what if doing the right thing in one instance also includes doing the wrong one in another?" Rio asked back, reaching up to wipe at her wet cheeks.</p><p>Rio was emotional, for valid and obvious reasons, but Agatha's panic only seemed to be growing. She didn't want it to end, yet. She didn't want to make her decision sitting in that bed while this was all still so new and fresh. Sure, Rio had already stated that she was aware of the most likely outcome, but stating it right then and there wasn't something Agatha thought she could do.</p><p>She wasn't ready to let Rio go, even if that meant staving it off for the next few hours.</p><p>Without verbalizing an answer, Agatha leaned forward and pressed her lips softly to Rio's, though she did not make any other attempt at contact. The kiss lasted a beat longer than it might have otherwise, but Agatha's eyes were gentle as she pulled away to behold the woman in front of her.</p><p><i>"I'm going to go home,"</i> she declared in a whisper and she could see the exact moment that Rio entered the battle into holding it together while Agatha was still present. <i>"I just... need to think. I'll call you tomorrow, okay?"</i></p><p><i>"Okay," </i>Rio managed back in the smallest squeak.</p><p>Against her better judgement, Agatha took another soft kiss before she shifted to slide off the edge of the bed.</p><p>
<i>"I love you, Agatha."</i>
</p><p>The panic rapidly boiling in Agatha's chest won out.</p><p>
<i>"I know. I'll talk to you tomorrow, Rio."</i>
</p><p>Her exit happened in enough time that she had missed the stifled sounds of Rio's sobs as they were hurled into the pillow she pressed into her face at the regression to previously used terminology.</p><p>In Agatha's turmoil, she had not been intentional with her words. She had let go of something she didn't truly mean because she was scared, because she was facing the fact that she had finally fucking let herself love someone and she was being met with a slap in the face in the form of knowing it was likely coming to an end.</p><p>What was even worse was the fact that this? This entire instance, with Rio being the protective healer she was? It was every single reason Agatha knew she'd fallen in love with her. It was every single reason Agatha looked at her and saw the light of a thousand stars. Rio was a bright fucking human, one who had a heart that was entirely too pure for the world they occupied. It was also a heart that was too pure to be dimmed by the darkness Agatha would never be able to chase from her own life.</p><p>Agatha was not a crier. She had cried twice since meeting Rio and both of those instances were in relation to the tidal wave of emotions that came with what it meant to think about Nicky. Even in the back of that rideshare as she stared hard out of the window, she did not cry. Even when she walked into that empty townhome that was now decorated with the smallest traces of Rio -- a half full bottle of bourbon, a little sketch of the vase of flowers on the dining table pinned to the refrigerator with a magnet -- Agatha still did not cry.</p><p>Instead, Agatha thought.</p><p>She thought about Rio. She thought about how deeply she felt for Rio and how much that had scared her. She thought about how it stopped scaring her right in time for Rio to make a move so true-to-form that it shoved Agatha right back into that place of fear. Agatha was afraid of all that Rio was when it was so brightly blinding her that all Rio would ever be was a good goddamn person.</p><p>Agatha thought about Stevie. Even though she didn't know what the little girl looked like or who she was as a kid, she knew that whoever she was, she had captured Rio's heart. She had also reached down into the very roots of who Rio was and tugged on a piece of her she could not ignore. She thought about the little details Rio had dropped, like how Stevie liked video games and coloring.  She thought about the flower Rio said she drew on her cast. She thought about how Stevie didn't like strawberries.</p><p>Nicky had hated strawberries and had put up a three month fight on trying raspberries as a result. He had ended up liking those, though.</p><p>Eyes on the ceiling of her bedroom, Agatha thought about Nicky.</p><p>He had been around that same age when she had lost him. He had been so loved by her, so cared for by her, and she had done everything she could to keep him to still be forced into letting him go. She missed his green eyes, missed his laugh. She missed the way she would use her thumb to brush the ketchup off of the corner of his mouth when he was eating grilled cheese. She missed the nights of laying in bed with him, reading The Dozer Who Didn't over and over again until he'd practically memorized it enough that he would take over.</p><p>All of those good moments, all of the ones that still made her eyes sting with fondness, they were still there. They hurt now, sure, but would they if she'd gotten the chance to keep him? The answer there was an obvious no. Instead, she'd have two decades worth of memories to hold onto, to keep.</p><p>She could have more.</p><p>She could make those memories again.</p><p>She could make them with Rio and Stevie.</p><p>At that train of thought, Agatha blinked at the ceiling. They were not <i>wrong</i> thoughts in the sense that they were incorrect, but they <i>felt</i> wrong for Agatha to be having.</p><p>Did that dishonor her son? Did it indicate that losing him wasn't as important as it once was? Did it put a stain on his memory because she was choosing to make new ones, with an actual partner and a child who could truly benefit from their help?</p><p>The simple and truest answers to those questions was: No.</p><p>In fact, making such a choice could have only ever made him proud of her, she realized.</p><p>He had been so young, but Agatha knew deep down that he never would have wanted her to go on for decades, living in her grief. He never would have wanted her to isolate herself from the good things in life. He never would have wanted her to shy away from being loved by someone else. He would have wanted her to be happy.</p><p>Happy.</p><p>Agatha swatted around the bed for her phone. Once she found it, she went straight for her gallery, scrolling through to find the photo she was looking for.</p><p>It was the first one Rio had taken of them together, their cheeks smushed and grins brighter than the sun.</p><p>Agatha realized something as she stared at the image, letting it scar itself into her retinas.</p><p>The look she was wearing in that photo wasn't just happiness.</p><p>It was love.</p><p>Agatha loved Rio, even if she had been a complete asshole in being able to tell her. Agatha loved Rio when she woke up in the morning with morning breath and messy hair. Agatha loved Rio when she laughed at Agatha's clumsiness as she tripped up the stairs. Agatha loved Rio when she leaned over the bed on Sunday mornings and told Agatha to keep the day holy while she was at work and left her with a soft kiss.</p><p>Agatha loved Rio. It was really that simple.</p><p>The question now was could Agatha love herself enough to make that known, not only in words, but in the biggest actions she would ever need to prove it?</p><p>She tossed and turned, unable to stop thinking once she had started. She spun circles in her own mind for an eternity before she had finally accepted that each time she reminded herself she loved Rio, it was only giving her the answer she needed.</p><p>The time on her phone screen read 2:59am as she brought up Rio's contact page and called her.</p><p>It rang. And it continued to ring. As Agatha accepted she was about to be kicked over to voicemail, the line connected and she could hear a slight shuffling on the other side.</p><p><i>"Agatha? Is everything okay? It's three in the morning..."</i> came Rio's groggy and deep inquiry.</p><p><i>"I want to do it,"</i> Agatha said immediately, knowing she could give herself no wiggle room in terms of delaying such a declaration.</p><p>There was silence. It was heavy and cutting, but it sat there for a few seconds until Rio offered her rebuttal.</p><p><i>"You don't mean that, Agatha. You haven't slept and you just need more time to really think about it," </i>Rio attempted to dismiss and it left Agatha feeling disgruntled as her brow furrowed tightly in unseen response.</p><p><i>"You don't get to do that, Rio,"</i> Agatha shot back, her soft voice a little more pointed.</p><p><i>"No, Agatha, you don't get to call me at 3am when you're pumped on adrenaline because you haven't slept and say things you haven't given enough thought to,"</i> Rio returned and while the words were a little harsh, the voice she used to delivered them informed Agatha that she was still recovering from a deep sleep, but they still caused a spike of panic to flare in her chest.</p><p><i>"I don't need to think about it anymore, Rio,"</i> Agatha rushed, but it was what came out next that hadn't been planned, it was simply a continuation of the urgency she was feeling in her chest. <i>"I love you and I know it's insane, I know it's wild, and I know that I am probably nowhere near prepared enough to raise a child again, but with you... I want to. I... Maybe this is just the universe's way of... Of letting me have a second chance..."</i></p><p><i>"Agatha... you need to get some sleep," </i>Rio told her softly, and the dismissal was like a shot through the heart.</p><p>She had finally said it, and Rio hadn't even heard it. If she had, she'd ignored it, like most of everything else she had just said.</p><p>Agatha tried to speak, tried to find the words that might either convince Rio that she was being honest or would let this suddenly painful conversation be over, but nothing was forming. Nothing was fitting together the right way. Nothing could convey what it felt like to finally tell Rio she loved her and hear nothing in return other than admonishment that she needed to go to bed.</p><p>So, in an instance where nothing else made any sense at all, Agatha let herself do the unthinkable.</p><p>She let herself cry.</p><p>She could almost hear it, the way that Rio sat bolt upright in bed on the other end of that line. She could hear, even over her own quiet and pained sounds, as Rio sucked in a breath at the realization that she had not handled this appropriately.</p><p>
<i>"Hey, hey. I'm sorry. But I'm getting dressed now. I'll be there as soon as I can get a car over. Do you want me to stay on the phone with you until then?" </i>
</p><p>This question only made Agatha shake harder, still in the rut of not being able to find words. Rio seemed to take this as answer enough and did not disconnect the call.</p><p>Agatha heard every second of her moving around to pull on clothes and shoes. She could hear the vibrations of Rio's phone as she looked for a car. Agatha could hear as she gave up and stepped outside to flag down a cabbie in the dead of night. She listened through the quiet ride, unable to answer Rio each time she asked if Agatha was okay with anything other than another choked sob.</p><p><i>"I'm here, I'll be right up,"</i> Rio informed her before the call disconnected and she heard the front door slam shut. In the next moments, she heard as Rio took the stairs more than one at a time and came whipping around the corner of the doorway.</p><p>She did not lift her head from where it was resting on the pillow, even as Rio slid onto the bed next to her and did not second guess wrapping Agatha in her arms, pulling her up and into her chest. Agatha's wet cheek landed against the thin fabric of the thin t-shirt Rio was wearing and Rio's hand came up to cradle her head, smoothing over her hair affectionately. She was quiet for those first few moments, but finally, Rio found her voice.</p><p>
<i>"I love you too, Agatha. And I'm sorry I didn't say it right away."</i>
</p><p>Through her tears, Agatha couldn't fight the breath of a laugh that escaped her. How fucking backwards was that? Rio had been telling Agatha for months that she loved her and it had taken Agatha <i>this long</i> to be able to say it. Why the hell did Rio think she owed any kind of an apology?</p><p>Agatha took another couple of minutes to reform and rebuild the shambles she'd let herself fall into, wiping at the cheek that wasn't pressed to Rio's chest.</p><p><i>"I meant it, Rio," </i>she finally managed in a hoarse whisper. <i>"I want to do this with you. I want to adopt a little girl that already means so much to you so that you and I can give her a life that she might not get to have otherwise."</i></p><p>Rio was still for a moment but it was broken by the way she tilted her head down to place her lips to the top of Agatha's head. Agatha wasn't done, though.</p><p>
<i>"I'm terrified, that is to be made abundantly clear. But between losing you or choosing to do something <b>with</b> you that makes me uncomfortable? Someone very intelligent and very wise once told me that there was little wrong in doing things that make us uncomfortable. So... The choice, for me, is obvious. I'd rather push myself through that than let you go. I do love you, Rio, and that's what that means to me."</i>
</p><p>Agatha had felt them, the couple of teardrops that had landed on the top of her head with the way Rio's lips were pressed there as she cried. Slowly, the contact was removed and Agatha felt as Rio's hand lifted and her fingertips graced the underside of Agatha's chin, a silent request to be met evenly.</p><p>Agatha lifted her head and straightened a little so that she could look directly into Rio's eyes in the dark of the night.</p><p><i>"Say it again,"</i> Rio nearly begged, her thumb brushing lovingly over Agatha's bottom lip.</p><p>Agatha knew what she wanted to hear. With an earnest and true look in her eyes, she said it.</p><p>
<i>"I love you, Rio Vidal. And I want us to have a family."</i>
</p><center>

I want you, in all of my pain, through all of my pain.<br/>
I see you in what you give and you take.</i>

<p>3:30 am came and went and Agatha remained curled against Rio's chest in the silent darkness.</p><p>3:45 am came and went and still, Agatha had not moved and Rio remained completely still.</p><p>4 am came and turned into 4:01 am when Agatha finally spoke, not entirely sold that Rio was even still awake.</p><p>
<i>"I think we should elope."</i>
</p><p>It was breathed into the night like Agatha's biggest secret, but she could hear Rio's heart pick up in her chest, just below Agatha's ear. Rio wasn't asleep; she'd heard every single word Agatha had said.</p><p><i>"I'm not trying to be dismissive,"</i> Rio braved this time in a low murmur, trying to use the rational thought she'd garnered over the couple hours of sleep she had gotten that Agatha had not, <i>"but I do think you're running on fumes at this point."</i></p><p>Rio wasn't <i>trying</i> to be dismissive, but she was still being dismissive.</p><p>Agatha lifted her head from Rio's chest and scooted up just enough so that their gazes could meet dead-on in the dark. The little lamp was not on and the only light in the room was what poured in from the moon outside. There was the gentlest shimmer in Rio's dark eyes, a wet sheen that conveyed to Agatha just how carefully she needed to choose her next words. She took just a moment to find her way through such a feat before she let the words hit the air around them.</p><p><i>"It makes sense,"</i> Agatha opened quietly, trying to point out the obvious in a way that wouldn't force Rio into turning the idea down right off the bat. <i>"You... Money is no issue for you, obviously, but... There are things that look better on the fostering applications, which we will need to file right away. I don't know exactly how long they take to get app--"</i></p><p>"Three to six months. Her social worker said with the circumstances, she might be able to expedite but made no promises," Rio supplemented, not meaning to interrupt but knowing she already had the information Agatha needed filled in.</p><p>"After that..." Rio ventured, her lips worrying together for a moment before she continued. "It could be six months, typically before we can legally adopt her. So it's... going to take time."</p><p>Agatha's expression softened noticeably; did Rio think she was unaware of that one fact? This wasn't a case of instant gratification by any means. However, if Rio would hear her out on this, it could only help when building their case. It showed stability, it showed unity, it showed two women who were willing to do what they needed to do so that they could obtain such a dream.</p><p>More than that, Agatha wanted it to show Rio how much she really did love her and the lengths she would go to in order to prove it. Agatha wanted to show Rio that she was past the subscription phase. She wanted to invest all she had in a future where they were together, where they spent the next year jumping through every single hoop it took for them to become parents.</p><p><i>"But that doesn't mean we have to wait to make the big moves," </i>Agatha responded softly, her own blue eyes speckled with her honesty as they glimmered in the moonlight. <i>"It's Friday and you don't work. I have no business going to work after not sleeping and can email for a sub. I will get a nap and we can go for a marriage union and get the license. By the time we submit the fostering application this afternoon, we'll have it to include."</i></p><p>Agatha stopped herself before she pressed on, realizing that she was talking about the idea of marriage like a business transaction, like something that wasn't as filled with emotional intent as it actually was.</p><p>
<i>"I... I know that it's sudden... but..."</i> Agatha raised her hand, reaching up to cradle Rio's far cheek. <i>"I also feel that it's inevitable."</i>
</p><p>That was a statement. That was a bold statement to be coming from the lips of Agatha Harkness. It was something she did not state flippantly or without any consideration. It was something she truly meant.</p><p><i>"You know as well as I do that I have never felt the way I do for you about anyone else I have met in my life. And... I have met a lot of people. You... you know that I struggle and I know you just heard words you've been waiting months to hear less than two hours ago, but... I don't see my life going in any other direction." </i>Agatha paused and let her hand drop, her eyes moving to lift over Rio's shoulder as she attempted to find the courage to keep going.</p><p><i>"You have been inevitable since the moment I met you,"</i> Agatha stated, as if it were the most obvious thing in the universe. <i>"This never should have worked, not in the way it has, but the universe has kept me hovering around you, caught in your gravitational pull. Every single time I've thought it would be better to leave, the farthest I've gotten is right here. And... I think there's something to be said about the fact that tonight is the first night I've even gotten this far."</i></p><p>Agatha's eyes shifted again, landing back on Rio's face who was completely unmoving, a look of unimaginable awe written across her features. Agatha was shedding light on the obvious, sure, but it was clear that they were things Rio had overlooked. <i>"I love you, Rio, and it is a lot easier to say than I convinced myself it would be, once I could finally get myself to do it. So yes, getting married is a smart thing to do in the grand scheme of adoption..."</i></p><p>Agatha took a breath but it got lodged somewhere in the middle of her throat. Her eyes stung for just a moment but she blinked the tears back. She had shed enough tears that night and it would serve neither of them well for her to get emotional again. After a sheer show of her own internal force, she found it in her to breathe again.</p><p>
<i>"And... I'd be lying if I told you I would have considered it without the push... But I don't want to wait when there's no point. I'm never going to love anyone the way I do you and I would never <b>ever</b> make a commitment like this to someone else, and I can say that with certainty. So yes, it will look good on paper. But... It will feel even better to live it after a lifetime without it."</i>
</p><p>Somewhere toward the last chunk of Agatha's speech, the tears had started to spill down Rio's cheek, glistening as they dropped.  Agatha's hand lifted again so that her knuckles could brush away the rivers of emotion before she cupped the warm skin of her cheek in her palm. It was clear that this was what Rio had been wanting, what she had been aching for, and now that she finally had it, it was putting her in a mental space where she had to fight to understand it, had to fight to integrate it into the reality of her own life.</p><p>After only a moment more was spent on the search for what to say, Rio found a way forward.</p><p><i>"Has anyone ever told you that you're really good with words?"</i> she posed, her head tilting a little into Agatha's touch.</p><p><i>"I haven't been, as of late, but this charming and beautiful doctor has made me want to figure it the fuck out."</i> Despite just how honest she was being, Agatha couldn't help the small smile that curled her lips.</p><p>Another beat of silence hung between them and Agatha could see clearly that Rio was thinking, that she was feeling. She was trying to find an even balance to both of those things and Agatha could almost see the resistance before Rio raised her question.</p><p><i>"You really want to go to the courthouse later?" </i>she managed, working her cheek a little more firmly against Agatha's palm who only brushed her thumb beneath Rio's eye in initial answer.</p><p><i>"We will need a couple of witnesses. I was thinking it might be a great first meet-the-friends date,"</i> Agatha offered, her smile only hitching up a bit higher, casting deeper and darker shadows across her striking features.</p><p>This dealt another emotional blow straight to Rio's chest. It was very, very obvious to Rio that Agatha had spent so long trying to stay out, trying not to fall into something she couldn't climb back out of. Now that she was in? She was all the way in, and clearly, Rio was struggling to catch up.</p><p><i>"Agatha..." </i>Rio managed back, her lips twisting in uncertainty. <i>"I... I love you, I do... but... it's throwing a lot in the pot right from the start."</i></p><p>Agatha took only a moment to hear her words, and then she truly heard them.</p><p>She was overstepping. Maybe Rio was right, maybe she did need to go to sleep. It was nearing four-thirty in the morning and she was making wild declarations into the night as if she wouldn't have to answer to them when she woke up hours later.</p><p>Agatha took a breath to center herself, her caress dropping from Rio's face to land over the fingers of one hand, squeezing them softly.</p><p><i>"You have waited months for me to start showing initiative, or to even start showing some form of active reciprocation. I... I may be getting carried away. But... I still believe eloping is the right move, and we <b>will</b> need witnesses, but we could find people on the street for all I care. I just... figured it might mean more to you to have your friends there,"</i> Agatha explained, her quiet voice wavering only slightly as she spoke.</p><p>Rio's features were smooth, but the look in her eyes, even in the dark, told Agatha that she was doing her best to be sure of this, to believe in what Agatha was telling her. It told Agatha that she hadn't quite reached that destination, yet.</p><p>
<i>"I just... I believe you and I truly think you believe yourself... But the fact that you've gone from zero to one-hundred just... gives me pause, that's all." </i>
</p><p>As the words landed and settled, Agatha suddenly understood.</p><p>The fact that she loved Rio was not a new one for her. It was for Rio. She'd been hanging on for weeks, freely delivering the heavy sentiment time and time again to be met with acknowledgment, but not a return. Rio had been patient, and now she sat there being told everything she would have ever wanted to hear, but likely she had been intending to hear them interspersed between other moments of their lives.</p><p><i>"I know that I've been unfair in that I haven't been telling you the things I've been thinking and feeling when it comes to the depths of our relationship, but... That doesn't mean I haven't been thinking and feeling them, as I've tried to assert before. I've just been absolutely horrible at finding any way to express them verbally." </i>Agatha stopped herself, taking a moment to carefully construct what she wanted to say next.</p><p>
<i>"I've known, Rio. I've known that I've loved you for a while, and... that has terrified me. Because in my head, once I let you know, it would be more painful if you left."</i>
</p><p>Rio turned her hand over in Agatha's grasp so that she could hold on tightly, though her eyes never moved from Agatha's face.</p><p><i>"It's not in my nature to run,"</i> Rio responded gently, squeezing tighter at Agatha's fingers. <i>"I believe in exhausting resources to find viable solutions to problems. There's always an answer, even if it isn't an easy one."</i></p><p>Agatha's posture slackened and she gripped Rio right back. She wanted to respond, but Rio had put it pretty well. Agatha had projected. She had put her own ability to run on Rio's shoulders without stopping to consider who Rio <i>actually</i> was.</p><p>Rio was a lighthouse, one built from immovable stone. She stood resolute at the edge of chaos, ready to offer a beacon, a call, to those lost in the storm. The light, from such a distance, could be a focal point, something to follow to safety.</p><p>For Agatha, the closer she got, the more Rio's light touched, the more it shed illumination on the caverns Agatha had thought to be lost within her. The storm that had been chasing her for over a decade was beginning to dissipate the more she moved toward the safety Rio offered. The darkness was finally beginning to ebb away.</p><p><i>"To me... this is the answer,"</i> Agatha told her in a whisper. <i>"To me, it makes the most sense to take this leap. The worst that can happen is that we do it, we get through the adoption process, and then if we can't stand each other by that time, or even after? We figure out how to co-parent amicably and go from there. But... That is something I do not see happening."</i></p><p>Rio was studying her, surely trying to pinpoint <i>any</i> part of Agatha that might have been having reserves. She was peeling back the layers in her mind with that scrutinous gaze under the shroud of morning darkness. For only a moment, Agatha wished she could hear what Rio was thinking, wished she could have a peek into that beautiful mind of hers. After just another second, Rio found her voice.</p><p><i>"Why don't you send in that email and we can lay down. After a couple of hours of rest, we can continue this conversation. I hear you, and I agree with you, but you really do need to try and sleep even a little bit." </i>Rio was always so caring, so concerned, and it was always so magnified by the way she understood the mechanics of the human body.</p><p>
<i>"When we wake up, if you're still certain, we can get ready and I will text Johan and Julia to meet us at the courthouse as soon as they can. If you change your mind, there will be no hard feelings. Is that fair?"</i>
</p><p>Agatha simply stared at the woman she loved.</p><p>Even in the biggest moments, the moments that anyone else would have been pushy about one way or another, Rio was lovingly making sure that Agatha knew where the back door was located. Rio was still offering her the ability to run.</p><p>Rio had not realized it yet, not to its fullest extent. Agatha had told her, that while ago, but she meant it right then more than she ever had.</p><p><i>"It's fair,"</i> Agatha agreed with a gentle nod. <i>"But I'm not running this time. Not from you. Not anymore."</i></p><p>The tone, the emphasis, the cadence Agatha used were all explicit choices. Each word was an assertion, a pointed show of just how much she meant what she was saying. The way that Rio's fingers flexed into the back of Agatha's hand was a declaration that she heard it, she understood it. It took her a couple of moments to respond, but Agatha let her have the time she needed.</p><p>Rio lifted the hand that wasn't fastened around Agatha's and brought it up to Agatha's face. She did not make an instant move to cup or cradle and instead extended two fingertips. They graced along the width of Agatha's hairline, dropping to her left temple. From there, they danced their way to Agatha's jaw and skated down the length of one side to her chin. As they curved the bend and found their way up the other side, Agatha's eyes fluttered shut.</p><p>Never before had she known a touch like that, and having it now was nearly enough to cripple her. As Rio's caress moved, over cheekbones and eyebrows, Agatha's lips had parted and the softest sigh of relief passed through them.</p><p>She heard Rio loud and clear, even without the sentiment she breathed right after she leaned in to press her lips tenderly to Agatha's.</p><p>
<i>"I love you, Agatha."</i>
</p><p>It took not even a full breath before Agatha responded.</p><p>
<i>"I love you too, Rio."</i>
</p><p>With another soft kiss, Rio removed most of the contact she had been responsible for, though with the way they were positioned, they were still pressed to one another.</p><p><i>"Now will you please lay down with me and turn off that brain of yours?" </i>Rio requested in a tone that was tired, but still sweet.</p><p>Agatha's only response was to lean in and take another, slightly longer kiss that attempted to convey her love and gratitude in a way she was too tired to do in words. When she pulled away, their eyes met in the dark and a warm smile pulled at the corners of her lips. She was quick in the way she grabbed her phone and fired off a brief email to garner a substitute for the day. Without another word, Agatha tossed the phone aside and shifted to lay down, immediately fitting herself to Rio the moment she followed suit.</p><p>Her head had landed on Rio's chest, an arm draped over her middle as she felt the other woman secure a firm hold around her, as well.</p><p>It had taken mere minutes for Agatha's eyelids to grow heavy, lulled into comfort by the sound of Rio's beating heart beneath her ear. Before she could let herself slip, though, her half-asleep mind found the need for assertion one last time.</p><p>
<i>"I love you."</i>
</p><p>If Rio had returned the sentiment, Agatha hadn't heard it as she slipped easily into the warmth of slumber.</p><p>When she found consciousness again, she could still hear the steady, if not slower, thumping of Rio's heart. Agatha had figured that Rio was asleep because of it, but then the rest of her senses began to present. The most noticeable one was the feeling of being touched, the light and repetitive motion of fingertips dragging through her hair to press only slightly into her back, made possible by the way she had ended up half-folded over her girlfriend.</p><p><i>"Mmm,"</i> Agatha managed in a half-hum half-grumble.</p><p><i>"Good morning, my love,"</i> Rio whispered into the morning air.</p><p><i>"Any chance I can sleep a little longer?"</i> Agatha murmured, exhaling a soft sigh against the fabric of Rio's t-shirt.</p><p>
<i>"You can, and probably should,"</i> Rio offered, but her tone wasn't brimming with encouragement. <i>"But if you do, you're not going to be happy with yourself. So... a concession must be made somewhere." </i>
</p><p>Rio was teasing, clearly, but Agatha knew she was right. If she slept more, they wouldn't go to the courthouse. If she slept more, that meant Rio would be doing most of the paperwork on her own and they wouldn't have the marriage license to send in with it. If she slept more, the whole day would fall apart.</p><p>In the middle of those thoughts, Agatha felt as Rio shifted to crane her neck forward, lips pressing to the top of Agatha's head.</p><p><i>"At some point today, I... I should stop by the hospital, just to see her for a few minutes."</i> Even though Rio delivered it like she was afraid it might shatter the frailty of what was in the process of unfolding between them, it did not jar Agatha in the way either of them had been expecting.</p><p>
<i>"Of course. You've started a routine. You don't want to break it. I understand and can wait in the lobby while you visit with her."</i>
</p><p>What such a statement meant to Rio was immediately apparent on her expression and in the way her eyes developed a glassy layer of dampness. She was in the middle of watching Agatha as she evolved, as she shed the weighted layers of her past and stepped into the warmth of becoming someone new, someone better, someone worthy of the attention and emotion that was being poured so freely into her. Agatha couldn't see it from where she laid, but it was still there, just above her.</p><p><i>"Sometimes,"</i> Rio breathed at her, fingers still raking through her hair, <i>"you really make it hard to know what to say. And for me --"</i></p><p><i>"It's an unimaginable feat, I know," </i>Agatha interrupted to prod and tease, squeezing herself a little tighter to Rio's frame. In response, she felt very acutely in four different places as Rio's fingertips sank into the places between her ribs.</p><p><i>"That aside, I just want to tell you..."</i> Rio murmured, though her need to look Agatha in the eyes became apparent as she lifted her free hand and gave a light tap to the bottom of Agatha's chin.</p><p>Agatha heeded the call and lifted her head up so that her face was hovering only about six inches away from Rio's. There, she saw it. There, she could clearly witness the pride and the joy and the love. There, she could see Rio's intentions written into every muscle of her face.</p><p>
<i>"It has been an undeniable honor to watch you grow and blossom into who you are becoming, and maybe partially into who you once were. I understand the weight of the responsibility that you are volunteering to take on, and I will admit that you being so willing has... caught me off guard. But... I made an assumption..."</i>
</p><p><i>"It might have felt like a safe one in the moment," </i>Agatha acknowledged, her voice still low as her own touch lifted to land on Rio's chest where her head had not been a moment before. <i>"But it's okay that it was wrong. I didn't know how wrong it was until I laid in this bed at two-thirty in the morning thinking about too many things at once, either. So I don't blame you."</i></p><p>For a moment, Rio seemed to just bask in such an answer. Agatha, however, wasn't finished.</p><p><i>"But to acknowledge your first statement, you only get the honor because you watered the seed. And I hope you give yourself that credit. This... None of this would have happened if you were any other person."</i> Agatha paused and leaned forward, letting her lips grace against Rio's in a tenderly sweet kiss. She pulled back only an inch to continue.</p><p>
<i>"Who you are, inherently and truly, inspired me to want to see who I can become. It's scary, it's uncomfortable. But... If I stumble or take a bad step... The faith I have that you'll be there to catch me seems to grow a little more every day."</i>
</p><p>That glassiness returned to Rio's gaze, so soft in the light of day that beamed through the windows. From the looks of the rays, the sun was out and it was lending to a beautiful morning, both inside and outside of that townhome.</p><p>Rio looked stuck, but in a place of utter and complete reverence. She looked like she was so enamored with everything that she was hearing, everything she was seeing, and she finally had reached a point where she was not able to pinch in sarcasm or even her usually pointed defiance. What Rio was witnessing was more than she'd ever dreamed of and that awestruck look in her eyes shouted it at a deafening volume.</p><p>Agatha did not say anything more, did not push to try and justify all the things she had said. She did not assert yet again how sincere she was being, or how much she needed Rio to believe her. Agatha simply stayed where she was, Rio's breath still close enough to be warm on her face.</p><p>Several more moments passed and Agatha could see the work going on in those beautiful dark eyes. She could see the cogs moving, the gears turning in a way that rarely took so much effort from Rio. She was usually so quick-witted, so ready to provide a challenging response to anything Agatha had to say. Agatha knew that she still was, that she wouldn't lose that spark, but this was something Rio had not been ready to see and experience. That much was obvious.</p><p>Finally, Rio's lips moved, but only to press together as she placed those last few stones of resolution atop the pile she'd been amassing. Then, her voice sounded in the lowest of whispers.</p><p>
<i>"Do you still want to go to the courthouse?"</i>
</p><p>It could have been like a lead weight. That question would have sunk Agatha mere weeks ago. It could have debilitated her and left her immobile.</p><p>Instead, she was filled with the same emotions she'd been experiencing the night before and her decision nearly made itself.</p><p>
<i>"I do."</i>
</p><p>Rio's lips twitched, at first, but then pulled apart in a smile rooted in adoration, and perhaps a bit in mischief, too.</p><p><i>"You're supposed to save that until we're in front of a judge,"</i> she offered, though a gleam in her eyes that told Agatha this was going to be the temperament she was willingly binding herself to for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Agatha was more than okay with that.</p><p>She closed the space between them again with another kiss, but this one was heavier, meant a little more. Her hand shifted from Rio's cheek so that her fingers could wrap around to the back of her neck, thumb landing just in front of her ear. It was longer, lasting several moments as their lips brushed and pressed and sucked softly. It wasn't an enticing exchange, but rather one that was meant to be a display of Agatha's honest intent.</p><p>Their mouths broke apart and Agatha's eyes fluttered open, a gentle curve finding her lips as she beheld the woman before her.</p><p>"I'm going to go shower. You should text the J's and come join me," Agatha told her, finally finding a strength in her voice that had not been present since she'd been at Rio's the night before, just before she had tried to run. Not getting very far seemed to have played out just fine for the both of them.</p><p>Rio leaned back a little bit and the heat of her gaze suddenly caused a flush to form on Agatha's neck.</p><p>"What?" she probed, tucking her chin to avert her gaze, hoping it might chase away the pink on her skin.</p><p>"Oh nothing," Rio responded and in those vibrations, Agatha could hear that playfully flippant attitude as it returned. "Just thinking about how I'm going to fall asleep tonight as your wife. Crazy, isn't it?"</p><p>If there had been any hope of the blush on Agatha's skin disappearing, it was completely trashed at what Rio had to say. Instead, it spread like wildfire over every visible patch of her skin on her skin, neck and face. Rio was right, but hearing it stated so plainly was clearly having its effect.</p><p>"Pure insanity," Agatha answered, her voice still strong but low this time in its delivery. "However... If life with you continues and ends up anything short of that, I will be genuinely surprised."</p><p>As Agatha grinned, she was met with the exact same show of teeth from Rio.</p><p>"It is my promise to you to make your life complete chaos in whatever way you like," Rio informed her.</p><p>"Hey now," Agatha returned, rocking forward to steal another kiss before she immediately pulled herself out of bed, "shouldn't you be saving that for a judge?"</p><p>"Oh what it is to have my own sarcasm used against me. <i>Touché.</i>"</p><p>"Text now, be indignant later!" Agatha instructed. Her hands were moving as her legs carried her toward the bathroom. As she crossed the threshold, her shirt was stripped off and caught on the doorknob as she tossed it away.</p><p>As the water turned on, she glanced back out into the bedroom to see Rio typing away on her phone, surely requesting the presence of the people she cared about so that they could witness her doing something monumental and a little harebrained.</p><p>As Rio chewed on her bottom lip, Agatha wanted to turn away, to climb into the shower as she had stated she was going to, but the sentiment in her mind kept her rooted for just a moment longer.</p><p>
<i>Good Gods, I love that woman.</i>
</p><p>*****</p><p>As the two women climbed out of the back of a rideshare, hand in hand, Agatha had been expecting to feel completely inundated with nerves. She was, but not in the way she had been anticipating. Instead, every time she looked at Rio and knew what was under that coat that kept the early March chill from penetrating her bones, she saw what was underneath it in her mind's eye.</p><p>Rio thought she was fast enough, having gotten her coat from downstairs, when she threw it on before Agatha emerged from the bathroom. Agatha was letting her think that, but she had already caught a glimpse of the suit.</p><p>The outfit Rio had picked was entirely out of place for a day that was verging from winter to spring, but it looked <i>so good</i> on her.</p><p>Her black jacket was cropped in a way that left the bottom hem level with the middle of her ribcage and there was only a black tube top beneath it. The jacket had the faintest white pinstripes lining it and the pants she wore matched it. The legs billowed down, covering the black Doc Martens that adorned her feet.</p><p>Rio already knew what Agatha was wearing because she had picked it out and left it on the bed for her when she had emerged from their shower.</p><p>There, splayed on the bed, was the same outfit Agatha had worn the night she had gone to Lulu Green and ended up sitting on Rio's front steps until she got home almost two hours later than they were supposed to meet.</p><p>Dutifully, Agatha had dressed herself as well, rolling her eyes every time she added a new layer and Rio hummed in satisfaction. What she had not realized was that Rio had been waiting. As Agatha paced to the dresser and pulled out a couple of silver rings to adorn her fingers, Rio stepped up behind her. At first, Agatha had been expecting an embrace of coated arms, but what she got instead threw her a bit.</p><p>Rio had reached up and over both shoulders, hands stilling just on either side of Agatha's face. Her right one opened and the chain she was holding dropped down to its entire length, gold and glimmering in the sunlight that poured in through the window. Rio's movements were precise as she reached around in front of Agatha to take hold of the other end of the chain, bringing it around to the back of her neck so that she could secure the clasp there over the fabric of the turtleneck. The soft kiss that Rio had pressed to the back of her head and merely been the cherry on top.</p><p>Just thinking about it as they walked through those courthouse doors, hands clasped tight, to an awaiting duo that Agatha had not yet met, it was enough to spark a warmth in her stomach that extended into her chest.</p><p>Rio's expression lit up as the couple turned to them, the woman's smile instant and warm. Agatha kept pace with her as they made their way over to the pair, though her nerves had started to bubble within her. She watched as Rio wrapped her friend up in one arm while still clutching Agatha's hand in her other. As they parted, the woman -- with her loose chestnut curls and bright hazel eyes -- turned to face Agatha.</p><p>"Agatha, this is Julia, my cohort in chaos," Rio introduced and the woman's smile only grew brighter as she held out a hand.</p><p>Maybe Rio had warned her, maybe she hadn't. Agatha wasn't a hugger, and this woman seemed to recognize that.</p><p>Agatha took her hand and gave it a firm shake, accompanied by a warm smile.</p><p>"It's really nice to meet you. Sorry it's taken me so long and these are the circumstances," Agatha offered, but Julia shook her head dismissively in a way that caused her curls to bounce atop her shoulders.</p><p>"Please don't be. We're thrilled to be here for this. Rio has spoken very highly of you," Julia assured her.</p><p>"The same could be said for both of you," Agatha responded, turning her attention to the man who stepped up to offer his hand as well.</p><p>"Johan. Pleasure to meet you." His voice was as strong as his jawline, even though it was covered mostly in a dark beard that matched the tousled hair atop his head. His smile was bright and handsome and those dark eyes offered reassurance that what he was saying was genuine.</p><p>The entire time those introductions were taking place, Agatha was very aware of the death grip that Rio had on her hand. Agatha didn't even need to hazard a glance at her to know that she was beaming, that she was completely thrilled with watching two separate parts of her life suddenly merge in a turn of events that was undoubtedly unexpected by all parties involved.</p><p>"Thank you for asking us," Julia voiced, her eyes on Rio.</p><p>"It was actually Agatha's idea... All of it, honestly," Rio informed them and they seemed to have enough knowledge about Agatha that while it only lasted as long as it took Agatha to blink, the surprise on Johan's face had not gotten past her.</p><p>"Well," he voiced, that charming smile finding his face again, "We're thrilled to be here no matter the circumstances. Of which I am entirely too aware. And having met Stevie... and consequently having been told that I am 'too tall' and 'smile too much,' it's truly beautiful what you've both come here to do."</p><p>"She was nice to me," Julia offered with a small shrug.</p><p>Johan's eyes went wide as they snapped to his girlfriend.</p><p>"When did you meet her?!" he questioned, his pitch slightly elevated.</p><p>"Last night when they were wheeling her back from the MRI," Julia answered, her demeanor cool and casual. "She told me she liked my cat lanyard and that I had 'pretty hair.'"</p><p>Rio's laugh was loud and joyous the moment it passed through her lips. "That... sounds about right."</p><p>Listening to the three of them talk about this little girl, Agatha felt a little bit like she was on the outside looking in on something that almost felt too tender for her.</p><p>No, that louder voice cut in as it had so many times before. Nothing was too tender, or too soft. This was the right thing to do, no matter how much it was destined to bruise her. She would recover and Rio would soothe her, without question, from any instance that might ache upon impact.</p><p>Before she was able to dwell any longer, Rio brought her wrist up to check the time, her grin easy and instant as it wrinkled the corners of her eyes.</p><p>"We've got ten minutes, we should probably check-in."</p><p>The tiny troupe shuffled through the lobby of the courthouse and Agatha let Rio take the lead, passing their information along to the clerk about the time she had booked right after they had made the definitive decision to move forward with their plan. Agatha could overhear as the clerk told her the judge would have the license, ready to sign, once the short ceremony was completed. It took only fifteen minutes before they were being called back.</p><p>It almost felt like a blur, the way they stepped up in front of the lifted desk were a wiry man with short and thinning dark hair sat, a cordial smile upon his lips as the two women approached and their compatriots placed themselves in the gallery. He had explained how things would work and had asked if they had specific vows they wanted to exchange or if the standard was suitable and Rio had simply grinned.</p><p>"I heard her vows this morning and she'll hear mine every day for the rest of time. The standard will do."</p><p>And that, right there, was why Agatha was standing right there, holding Rio's hands like her life depended on it.</p><p>It had been an easy process and Agatha was more than ready to comply as she repeated the phrases she was fed and Rio did the same. It could have been solely part of the process, but when she looked Rio in the eyes to say what she needed to say, she used her tone of voice to convey just how much she truly meant what it was she was saying.</p><p>When they had informed the judge that they did not have rings, he had given a warm smile and signed the license, informing them that they were now wed and could kiss to prove their union.</p><p>Agatha's hands raised and found Rio's face with ease, holding her as though she were fine China as she pulled her in for a kiss.</p><p>The moment their lips met, there were soft cheers to Agatha's right as Julia and Johan vocally showed their support. It was nice, but Agatha wasn't focused on it.</p><p>Instead, she was willingly drowning in the realization that she was kissing her <i>wife.</i> They stood there, a pair, and they were officially <i>married.</i> It was surreal and surely, Agatha was going to have a reckoning at 2 am when the reality of everything that had happened in the last 24 hours settled with her.</p><p>In that moment, she could not have been happier. She had already made it a mental note that she absolutely needed to find time to stop by a couple of jewelers to try and secure a ring to place on Rio's finger. Agatha wanted the world to know that Dr. Rio Vidal was taken, and she was <i>hers.</i> Still, that would be a task to tackle the following week.</p><p>Right then, as they rejoined Rio's friends, the two of them had offered to take the women out to dinner. Rio had given a gentle shake of her head, but before she could speak, Agatha felt brave enough to say something first.</p><p>"It truly would be so kind of you but... Someone owes a sweet little girl a nightly visit," Agatha voiced, giving Rio's hand a gentle squeeze.</p><p>Johan snorted at this, causing the three women to grin.</p><p>"You're going to see Stevie?" Julia asked, unable to keep the curious delight out of her voice.</p><p>"Yeah... She asked me last night if I'd come see her and... While I did not know how this day was going to go, I told her I would," Rio explained, giving an innocent shrug of her shoulders.</p><p>Agatha had glanced away during the conversation between the two friends but she happened to look back in time to see the silent exchange between them. Julia's eyes had flickered to Agatha and then back to Rio, brows hiking in question. Rio, beside her, gave a gentle shake of her head and held her free hand up at her hip as if to end the conversation.</p><p>Agatha knew what they were saying without having to speak a word and Rio was right.</p><p>It wasn't the right time for Agatha to meet Stevie yet, and Agatha was okay with that.</p><p>They'd all locked in warm embraces and the other couple had been kind as they had shared their well wishes in gentle murmurs over Agatha's shoulder as they hugged her. They had spilled out into the afternoon and the other couple had departed for their car while Rio flagged down a cab. Her extended arm pulled open her coat a bit from the way she had not fastened the hook when she had put it back on inside the courthouse. Agatha's hands reached up and grabbed the open sides, managing to secure it closed.</p><p>"Don't want anyone else to see?" Rio teased as she leveled herself, a grin on her face as the cab rolled to the curb.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. "I don't care about that. It's still only just above freezing and your entire midsection is exposed," she retorted, her eyes narrowing slightly in jest.</p><p>"Oh, you mean my <i>abs?"</i> Rio offered, a pompous grin finding her face.</p><p>"Listen," Agatha shot back, using Rio's coat to pull her close enough that Agatha could steal a taunting kiss before she gently pushed Rio back. "We have a task to complete. And... We are both off work tomorrow. So I need you to not be enticing for the next hour or so."</p><p>"Agatha, I can breathe and you'd be enticed," Rio pointed out as she pulled open the back door of the cab and waved Agatha inside.</p><p>"Yeah, well," Agatha clipped as she folded herself into the back seat. Rio slid in next to her and closed the door once more. "Have you <i>seen my wife?! </i>Who could blame me?"</p><p>At this, Rio turned her head to take Agatha in, a smile finding her face that somehow read as both tender and wild at the same time.</p><p><i>"Call me that again,"</i> Rio requested softly, leaning in so their faces were only an inch away.</p><p>Agatha's grin was wide, bright, and immediate. Instead of answering right away, Agatha moved forward to engage in the softest kiss she was sure she had ever given to another human being.</p><p>
<i>"I love you, my wife."</i>
</p><p>Rio's expression somehow found a perfect medium of being entirely enthralled and also wanting to melt and her eyes were overflowing with emotion in a way Agatha thought to be far more beautiful than words would ever be able to convey.</p><p><i>"I love you too, my wife," </i>Rio murmured back and Agatha realized immediately why Rio's face had looked the way it did, because Agatha fell into an identical expression.</p><p>She, Agatha Harkness, was someone's wife.</p><p>Not just someone.</p><p>She was Rio's wife.</p><p>And they were on the way to the hospital so that Rio could spend some time with the little girl they were actively moving mountains for, so that they could make her theirs and provide her a life she deserved.</p><p>Being present in a hospital again left Agatha idle enough that it enabled her mind to run free, but it was something she had tried to skate away from. She had tried to keep herself busy and while she had succeeded mostly for the ten minutes she'd found herself in the waiting room of the pediatrics wing, her mind had started to wander back to the last time she'd been in such a wing.</p><p>Just as she started to slip, Rio came pacing down the hallway. Agatha's brow pinched and she got to her feet, slinging her coat over her arm.</p><p>"That wasn't long. Is everything okay?" Agatha asked Rio as she approached, though the smile she was wearing was... calm, confident.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, everything's fine," Rio dismissed with ease as she came to a halt in front of Agatha, her smile only growing.</p><p>"Then... are you ready to go?"</p><p>Rio shook her head and reached down to pick up Agatha's hand, lifting it to hold it in both of her own. Her eyes looked up from the task and met Agatha's nervous blue gaze head-on.</p><p>
<i>"There's someone who would like to meet you."</i>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Nerves were a part of the human experience. They were inevitable. Even people who didn't let it show, they still got nervous. Agatha knew that more than anyone as she followed behind Rio, pulled by the wrist. It wasn't that Agatha was dragging her feet, but the way her heart was suddenly the only thing she could hear as it thundered in her ears was also causing her to sputter quietly on every other breath she tried to take.</p><p>It wasn't that Agatha wasn't ready.</p><p>It was that she wasn't prepared.</p><p>She was running on <i>maybe</i> three and a half hours of sleep, she'd met Rio's friends, and they'd gotten <i>married.</i> It had been a day packed from end to end, but apparently, they had not quite reached the finish line yet.</p><p>Agatha could do this. She could walk in that room, take one look at this little girl who had so wholly captured her wife's attention in a way that had pushed them to the brink of insanity, and know that they were doing the right thing. She could see that little girl and recognize her for the catalyst she was. This was undoubtedly a process, but they were already in it and the first page of an application hadn't even been printed out.</p><p>They were in it <i>so deep</i> that Agatha's toes could no longer touch the bottom. Her head was still above the surface; she could see and hear everything that was going on, but there was nothing left for her to do other than to keep treading, to keep herself in a state of perpetual motion. She had to keep moving or she would sink.</p><p>Reaching the doorway that Agatha assumed opened up into Stevie's room, Rio slowed and came to a halt. Agatha watched as she drew in a deep breath and then turned, their eyes meeting over the foot of space between them.</p><p>The smile she offered was warm, but her eyes were giving her away.</p><p>"I... I should have asked," Rio admitted, glancing back toward the open door before she looked back at Agatha. "I should have asked if you were okay, if you feel ready. So... I am asking now. We're still at a point where it's okay if you need more time."</p><p>Agatha's lips pressed firmly together, becoming white around the edges. Her eyes lifted, only able to see a sliver of the dark wooden door. Now that the hammering of her heart had finally subsided, she could hear better. She could hear the soft sounds of what was probably a child's cartoon -- Bluey, if she had to hazard a guess based on what Rio had told her -- and there were intermittent giggles.</p><p>Agatha's heart began to pound again. Her eyes widened slightly and Rio was aware of it the moment it happened. She squeezed Agatha's hand tightly, causing her to reign in her focus.</p><p>"It's okay," Rio soothed and for the first time in Agatha's life, she believed her without question. She believed her enough that she was able to swallow down the anxiety that was trying to ball up in her throat. She believed Rio enough to know that they had not come all this way for nothing, in more than just the physical sense.</p><p>Stevie had asked Rio to meet Agatha. How that had happened, Agatha did not know and would surely be informed the moment they stepped foot outside of the front doors of that hospital, but it had still happened.</p><p>She doubted that Rio had been so careless as to inform Stevie of what was going on, especially so soon, but there had apparently been an instance that had somehow sparked Stevie's interest in Agatha. There were obviously about a million different ways that conversation could have gone, but it would not prove useful to Agatha to try and figure out which one was the right one. Not at that moment, at least.</p><p>"You... You're sure she asked?" Agatha questioned, blue eyes so soft and so vulnerable.</p><p>A light chuckle passed through Rio's lips and she gave a gentle nod of her head.</p><p>"I was showing her a cool Bingo plushie I saw the other night at the convenience store. When I closed the gallery, she saw my phone background. She asked me who you were, I told her that you are my wife. She called you pretty and asked if you could come hang out too. There's a lot more to it than that, but for the sake of brevity... Yes, I am sure she asked."</p><p>Rio kept her voice measured and calm, knowing that Agatha needed soothing, that she needed to be handled with care on this. Rio knew Agatha so well that even though her initial reaction had been to charge in headlong, she had still caught it in enough time to slow down and have this conversation.</p><p>"Do you want to breathe with me?" Rio probed softly, giving Agatha's hand another firm squeeze.</p><p>Agatha knew it was rhetorical question. She knew that Rio was aware that normally, she would try dismiss it and say it was fine. Agatha instead chose to give a single nod, gripping back at Rio's hand tightly.</p><p>Rio took only a step forward and in the same motion, picked up Agatha's other hand.</p><p><i>"In for four,"</i> Rio instructed and Agatha listened. Their chests filled at the same time, rising with the effort.</p><p><i>"Hold for four,"</i> Rio continued, her hold on Agatha's hands tightening. Rio counted them down and then offered further command. <i>"Out for four." </i></p><p>They released the breath in unison over a four second time span. Rio offered one more guided direction.</p><p>
<i>"Hold for four, then we repeat."</i>
</p><p>And so they stood, two pillars that needed one another to support the weight of life that was placed atop them. They repeated the process several times over the next three minutes, but it had been exactly what Agatha needed.</p><p>Agatha swallowed and then she took one last breath. The moment it was exhaled, she let go of Rio's fingers and reached up to cup her cheek in the palm of her hand, that warm azure gaze falling into dark honey colored pools. It took her just a second to press forward, their mouths meeting softly as Agatha garnered one last bit of strength from the taste of Rio's lips.</p><p><i>"We can go in now,"</i> Agatha whispered against her skin, her breath warm on her own face due to their proximity.</p><p>She straightened her posture and finally tore her eyes away from her wife's face to look toward the space created by the doorway, but Rio was still looking at her; she could see it out of the corner of her eye. Slowly, her gaze reeled back in question, but Rio was smiling.</p><p><i>"I'm proud of you, Agatha,"</i> Rio informed her, giving the hand she was still holding a grip of support.</p><p>Agatha gave a tight smile and drew in another breath as Rio turned and pulled her gingerly into the room.</p><p>There, in the middle of that oversized hospital bed, sat a very small and very beautiful little girl with a hair clip pinned in her dark brown hair, one that had a small purple flower on it. Immediately, before even assessing anything else, Agatha wanted to melt on the spot. She saw it, she understood it already.</p><p>Her eyes continued their drop down, taking in the soft and delicate features of a sweet girl who's eyes lit up at the newcomer's appearance. Those eyes were the most beautiful color. They weren't quite blue, but did not have enough green in them to be called such. Primarily, they were a mix between those two and a gentle grey; it truly was the most remarkable shade of iris Agatha had ever seen.</p><p>There was a smattering of light freckles across her pale skin and when she smiled, Agatha could see those beautiful teeth and how the front two were just slightly bigger than the rest, even from across the room. Her face was thin, but there was light in her eyes that almost took Agatha's breath away.</p><p>She was so... <i>small.</i> So <i>frail. </i>Agatha's gaze
fell to the cast on Stevie's hand, pink and with a little flower drawn on it. As her survey continued and dropped to the line in her opposite hand and how it looked uncomfortable by the way Stevie was holding her arm out, everything inside of Agatha sheeted with frost and she felt frozen in the moment </p><p>
<i>"Blue Clues, momma! Steve!" Nicky demanded with a giggle as she thumbed through the channels, looking for Nickelodeon.</i>
</p><p>
<i>"I'm looking, baby boy," Agatha assured him, thankful that when she got to the correct channel, it was what was actually what was on.</i>
</p><p>
<i>A delighted squeal sounded from behind her as Nicky clapped in approval, but his giggles were cut short by a soft and pained cry. She turned on her heel and paced back over to the bed where Nicky was attempting to pick at the IV in his the back of his hand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>"Baby, no. You have to leave that alone. It's helping you by giving you the medicine you need to be big and strong. It's going to make you feel better, but I know it hurts. Try to keep your hand on your lap. I know it's hard, bubs, but it'll make it hurt a little less."</i>
</p><p>
<i>His big green eyes looked up at her with his lips turned down at the corners.</i>
</p><p>
<i>"I don't like it, momma," he told her, his brow furrowing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Carefully, Agatha placed herself on the edge of his bed, tucking a knee up and reaching for his hand that did not have the IV in it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>"I know, Nicky. But... the doctors and nurses are doing their best to make you better. I know it's painful and I know you just want to go home to your space bedroom and your stuffed animals, but we've got Señor Scratchy right here to keep you company," she offered in consolation, picking up the stuffed rabbit to place in Nicky's lap.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky let go of her hand to pick it up and hug it tight to his chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>"Momma, can you lay with me? I'm sleepy."</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha leaned forward and pressed her lips to his warm forehead, her stomach sinking at how high his temperature still was after all the treatment that had been administered.</i>
</p><p>
<i>"Of course, my sweet boy."</i>
</p><p>Very actively, Agatha was forcing herself to remember what it meant to perform the most basic human function and just breathe. The memory had been incapacitating, but she knew she still had to be present where she stood.</p><p>Rio sensed the shift and stepped back so that she was side-to-side with Agatha, but before she could say anything, Stevie's exclamation came first.</p><p>"Mrs. Dr. Rio!"</p><p>Agatha had to scour her entire being for the steel resolve to not completely dissolve into an entire puddle of tears. She had to find the will to not even let them touch her lids. She had to completely shut down everything she was actively feeling for the sake of not blowing this to pieces.</p><p>Agatha managed a genuine smile, but it was also a terrified one, though she was doing a decent job of masking the latter emotion.</p><p>"Hello, Stevie, it's so nice to meet you," she greeted as Rio began moving again, pulling Agatha over to the chair that sat bedside. After a glance at her wife to see silent encouragement, Agatha took the spot and let go of Rio's hand.</p><p>"I'll be right back, I'm going to grab another chair," Rio informed the two of them, leaning down to press a kiss to the top of Agatha's head before she turned and exited the room.</p><p>"You're pretty, Mrs. Dr. Rio. I saw your picture on Dr. Rio's phone!" she announced and Agatha could feel that melting sentiment as it continued, sinking through to her very bones.</p><p>"You are quite pretty yourself, Stevie," Agatha informed her softly, leaning forward so that she could put her weight on her elbows atop her thighs.</p><p>"I like your long hair," the little girl informed her. She lifted a her casted hand tentatively, fingers outstretched, but she didn't reach forward. "Can I touch it? It looks soft."</p><p>Agatha smile was warm as it tugged on the corners of her lips. She scooted forward and reached up with one hand to pull it over her shoulder so that it would be easier for Stevie to reach. Those small fingers gently tangled in it, rubbing it between them like it was smooth silk.</p><p>"It <i>is</i> soft!" she squealed before delivering the heavenly sound of a giggle.</p><p>Agatha had been reduced to nothing more than a heap of a human. Physically, she was holding her composure, but in those couple of minutes that Rio was taking to find that damn chair, Agatha was absolutely losing her hold on her decorum at such a display.</p><p>To her left, just out of view of her peripherals, Rio had returned, a plastic and metal chair clutched in both hands.</p><p>"Dr. Rio!" Stevie gushed, fingers still in Agatha's long and wild hair. "Did you know Mrs. Dr. Rio has really soft hair?!"</p><p>Rio laughed softly, giving a slight nod of her head as she made her way into the room and placed the chair next to where Agatha sat, though she made no move to take off her coat.</p><p>Hm, Agatha thought. Rio should have planned her outfit better, but that was something Agatha could tease her about later.</p><p>"I did know that. It's the special shampoo she uses. It smells like elderberries!"</p><p>Stevie's expression pinched thoughtfully as she tried to understand what that meant.</p><p>"Dr. Rio, what's an elderberry?"</p><p>"Well," Rio started, leaning forward in the same way Agatha was so they could be closer to Stevie. "It's science name is Sambucus. It's in a family of flowers because when the trees bloom, it makes a bunch of pretty white flowers before the berries start to grow."</p><p>Stevie was watching, eyes focused and her expression intent as she listened to Rio speak about flowers. She was so interested, hanging on to every word that came from Rio's lips.</p><p>Agatha could relate to that.</p><p>"How do you know so much about flowers and berries?" Stevie asked, her soft voice filled with wonder.</p><p>"My abuelo, which means grandpa, he had a farm where he grew something called sugarcane. It was very far out of the city and there was a lot of nature around, so he let me play by the creek where all the pretty flowers grew. I would pick one and bring it home to ask him what it was and he would tell me. His favorites were cherry blossoms, but there weren't a lot near us."</p><p>Hearing this for herself seemed to only soften Agatha further. Rio had not spoken much about her childhood other than to offer Agatha the necessary parts. She did not find a sense of discomfort that Rio was sharing things with Stevie that Agatha herself had not yet been privy to. No, she recognized it for all that it was.</p><p>Stevie was asking the right questions to get the answers she wanted to know.</p><p>Agatha had never been sure what answers she had been seeking from Rio, not enough to explicitly ask the right questions. Agatha was realizing, very quickly, that it might serve her well to take a page out of Stevie's book.</p><p>Stevie's attention had started to pull until finally her eyes dropped from Rio's face to Agatha's hands. The lull in the conversation had provided the ability for her to focus on the glints on Agatha's fingers as the light reflected on her rings.</p><p>"Mrs. Dr. Rio, you have a lot of rings," she commented, though her eyes never once wavered in their cause to examine each one. Agatha let her look for a moment before she made her own decision. She scooted the chair against the linoleum floor toward the bed until her knees hit the edge of it and she could not physically move any closer. Cautiously, Agatha lifted her hand and held it out toward Stevie.</p><p>Stevie was watching her like an absolute hawk. She didn't look skittish or scared, but she was very interested in what Agatha was doing, very observant of the way she moved. In fact, she seemed to actually pick up on Agatha's hesitation and her intent at the same time. She realized Agatha was letting her have a better look.</p><p>Slowly, Stevie lifted both arms and so gingerly took hold of Agatha's pinky finger and thumb, pulling her hand a little closer so that she could get a better look at the rings adorned there.</p><p>"Where'd you get this one?" Stevie asked without looking up, pointing to the one on her middle finger. It was pressed silver but it was woven into a chain pattern and the shine on it was immaculate and polished.</p><p>"I bought it when I lived in Paris," Agatha disclosed, her voice low but still warm and informative.</p><p>"Like Ratatouille?!" Stevie nearly gasped, wide grey eyes lifting to meet Agatha's blue ones.</p><p>What Agatha could not see, just behind her and to her left, was the intense look of mysticism and awe as it wrote itself all over Rio's expression. She could not see that Rio wasn't just watching what was happening between the two of them, she was <i>experiencing</i> it. She was letting it be her entire reality for the time they were together.</p><p>"Kind of," Agatha returned, her lips pressing together thoughtfully for a moment. She leaned in a hair closer, her voice dropping as if she was telling Stevie a secret. <i>"It's really way bigger than it looks in the movie, though."</i></p><p>That sound hit the air again on the flutter of an angel's wings.</p><p>Stevie's laughter.</p><p>As it began to subside, she seemed to realize that she was still holding onto Agatha's hand. Her eyes dropped again to the ring on Agatha's pointer finger, also pressed silver, but it was in the shape of an arrow and curved over ends instead of overlapping.</p><p>"What about this one, Mrs. Dr. Rio?" Stevie asked, though she just kept tracing her fingers over it as she asked.</p><p>"That one I bought online," she admitted, her grin wide when Stevie looked up at her with that smile on her face and that little giggle bubbling out of her again. It was the last one that seemed to draw her attention the most, though.</p><p>It was snug on Agatha's pinky finger, though it was the thickest of the three. It was a wide band of pressed silver, but there were the smallest floral patterns imprinted into it. Just past the mid-way point, there was a band of metal that loosely wrapped around it, enough that it could spin if Agatha moved her pinky forward enough to reach the base of it with her thumb.</p><p>Stevie recognized it for what it was instantly and used her nimble little fingers to spin it around, her eyes lighting up.</p><p>"This one's the best one," she declared, gently continuing to spin the metal. "It's like a fidget spinner but on your finger!"</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly and gave an affirming nod. "That's exactly what it is. It helps me when I get nervous, or when I'm unsure. I forget to wear it a lot of the time, though, so it doesn't help as much as it should."</p><p>"How come you forget? It's good to not be nervous," Stevie pointed out, looking back up at Agatha with those curious sweet eyes.</p><p>Agatha considered this for a moment, her gaze being the one to drop down to the piece of jewelry as she really thought about it. She knew she didn't exactly owe an honest answer, but if there were ever a place to start building trust, it was right there.</p><p>"Because I let myself think about lots of other stuff," Agatha disclosed, looking back up at the little girl with her adorable freckles and little hair pin. She watched her for just a moment before she braved her next question. "Do you get nervous sometimes, Stevie?"</p><p>There was the tiniest twitch in Stevie's lips before they turned down just noticeably. She did not speak, but she did offer the slightest nod. Agatha had accepted this as an answer, but Stevie found her ability to offer a qualifier.</p><p>"But not when Dr. Rio is here."</p><p>At this, Agatha was convinced that only the sheer laws of physics were keeping her held together in any sort of corporeal form. She was past melting, past dissolving. She felt like every single atom that made her what she was had begun to disassemble and detach from one another. What she was experiencing in those moments was as close to an out-of-body experience as she was ever going to get.</p><p>In a move that came automatically, Agatha looked back over her shoulder to the woman she loved most in the world, offering a soft but emotional smile.</p><p>It was Rio who scooted forward this time, leaning in close enough that her arm pressed firmly against Agatha's.</p><p>"I know that it's about time for your nighttime meds and bed, but... Do you think we could come back tomorrow night?" Rio offered her and Stevie seemed to take a total of five seconds before she offered her response.</p><p>"Will you both come back?"</p><p>Agatha had resolved herself to not cry, but the slight waver of uncertainty that rippled through that lone question was enough to make Agatha's heart feel like it was shattering in her chest. She glanced over at Rio, offering a silent confirmation so that Rio could provide an answer.</p><p>"We can both come back. And... tomorrow is Saturday, so neither of us have to work. Do you think it would be okay if we came to hang out for a couple of hours?"</p><p>Stevie subconsciously gripped at Agatha's hand in her grasp, her eyes widening in surprise.</p><p>"Really?!" she nearly squealed.</p><p>Both women nodded in sync.</p><p>Stevie leaned in a little closer, this time being the one who had a whispered request to drop, her eyes flickering to the door for only a moment before they landed back on Rio.</p><p><i>"Can you bring me some Reese's?"</i> she nearly whispered, though the grin that took over her face was as bright and warm as the midday sun.</p><p><i>"I think we can definitely bring you some Reese's,"</i> Rio responded, but she, too, glanced toward the doorway before her dark gaze landed on the little girl again. <i>"But you gotta try to be nice to the night staff, okay?"</i></p><p>Stevie offered an immediate pout in response, but before the conversation could escalate, Agatha had an idea.</p><p>"Here," Agatha indicated, giving a gentle tug on her hand so she could pull it from Stevie's grasp. Reluctantly, Stevie relinquished her hold. Agatha brought the free limb toward her chest as she sat up a little, freeing her other arm so she could raise it as well. Nimbly, she slipped the ring off of her pinky finger, looking at it for just a moment before her eyes lifted back to Stevie.</p><p>She dropped it into her palm and extended it out toward the little girl.</p><p>"How about you hold onto this? When you get nervous, or when you're upset, give it a little spin and think about something else until it goes away. Do you wanna try that for the night?"</p><p>Agatha was locked in; Rio could have leapt out of that chair and started smashing windows and screaming at the top of her lungs and Agatha wouldn't have noticed. She wouldn't have noticed anything outside of that look on Stevie's face as her eyes dropped to the ring and she seemed to contemplate the gift. By the reaction, Agatha could almost guarantee that no one had ever given this child something they did not eventually take back.</p><p>"If it works," Agatha encouraged, "then you can keep it."</p><p>This time, Stevie's astonishment was quiet.</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>Agatha smiled at her, a bit more warmly than she actually felt capable of. She gave a gentle nod of her head.</p><p>"Really."</p><p>Finally, Stevie raised the hand that bore the cast and pinched the ring between her fingers, lifting it up so that she could bring it closer for inspection. She raised the other hand and gave it a spin, a giggle filtering out from between her lips.</p><p>Gods, Agatha would never get used to that.</p><p>"Do you want it back when you come see me tomorrow?" Stevie asked, and Agatha could hear it. Stevie offered it like a bartering chip. She asked that question like she thought that if Agatha said yes, it might be another reason for them to come back. Despite that, Stevie moved to slide it onto her pinky finger on her good hand, though it was obviously too large for how small she was.</p><p>"What if you hold onto it until you're ready to give it back?" Agatha posed, her head tipping slightly to the side in sweet inquisition.</p><p>"You'll come back that long?"</p><p>Instantaneously, Agatha was in the strongest battle of wills to keep her expression smooth and placid in a way that would not betray just how heartbreaking that question in that tone actually was.</p><p>"We're going to try," Rio piped up, her palm sliding to lay flat on Agatha's back. Agatha knew. Agatha knew that Rio knew. Rio, in that moment, was showing that she recognized Agatha's hesitance, that she recognized the emotion that had suddenly overfilled her. "But for now, we should go home for bedtime, too."</p><p>"But you'll be back tomorrow?" Stevie asked, a craving an affirmation, to be told what she so desperately wanted to hear.</p><p>"We will. We promise," Agatha voiced this time, feeling brave enough to speak for both of them.</p><p>"Okay," Stevie voiced, her eyes flickering over to the TV and then back to the pair of them. "Sweet dreams Dr. Rio and Mrs. Dr. Rio."</p><p>Both women smiled at the same time, the exact same taken and tender smile.</p><p>"Sweet dreams," Agatha voiced.</p><p>"Get some sleep, kiddo," Rio added.</p><p>As they turned to leave, Rio patted her chest pocket, spinning back around.</p><p>"Oh!" she voiced, sliding up to the side of the bed. "I forgot something!" She reached into the coat pocket and slid out an orange wrapped package that Stevie recognized immediately. Rio slipped her the candy with a glance over her shoulder as if they were doing something secret. "Don't let Nina see it, but don't eat both at once, promise?"</p><p>"I promise," Stevie agreed easily, but then she did something else. It was something neither Agatha, nor Rio especially, had seen coming. Stevie rocked forward enough to bring her arms up around Rio's neck, giving her a hug. Rio seemed to freeze and although Agatha's eyes were fixed on the moment, she could hardly see through the tears that were brimming on her eyelids. When Stevie let go, she was still beaming. "Thank you, Dr. Rio. I'll put them under my pillow so nobody sees."</p><p>"Smart kid," Rio told her, reaching out to gently smooth her hair. "Goodnight, Stevie."</p><p>"Goodnight, Dr. Rio. Goodnight, Mrs. Dr. Rio."</p><p>As Rio's hand slipped into Agatha's, they both turned enough to offer the smallest waves over their shoulders in parting. The moment they stepped out of the room, Agatha's grip on Rio's fingers was like a vice and she wanted to be in the back of a car as soon as possible to prevent any risk of breaking down in front of a wing full of Rio's peers.</p><p>Rio read that energy and pulled her phone up, submitting for a car as they made their way through the hospital toward the front entrance. They made it out the front doors before the car arrived, though Rio had informed her it would only be a couple of minutes. They had moved off to the side and Agatha's leg had immediately begun to bounce the second she was still.</p><p>"Do you want to talk about it?" came Rio's voice from beside her.</p><p>Agatha chewed at the inside corner of her lips, not daring to look over at her wife.</p><p>"Not until we get home, if that's okay," Agatha answered back as strongly as she could despite everything in her body telling her she needed to fold.</p><p>"Of course it is," Rio answered, bringing up Agatha's hand to place a soft kiss to the back of it.</p><p>The car had pulled up a few minutes later and the ride back to Agatha's townhome had been very quiet, quiet in a way that Agatha and Rio never usually were. When they were nearly there, Rio broke the silence as she played with Agatha's fingers as Rio held her hand in her lap.</p><p>"When she saw the picture of us..." Rio began, looking down at the tangling of digits below her. "She asked me who you were, told me you were pretty. I told her you were my wife and her eyes got so big. She asked if you might some say hi sometime... And I told her that you were out waiting for me." Rio breathed a soft laugh. "Immediately, she asked if I would go get you. Who was I to say no?"</p><p>Agatha's lips twitched and she glanced out the window, thankful as the view of her home became visible on the other side of it. She let Rio slide out of the back seat and followed suit, their hands joining again in silence as they made it up to the door and Agatha unlocked it with ease. She let her hold on Rio go once inside to shed her coat, but before she could do much else, Rio stepped straight into her in that suit that was far too ridiculous for the time of year they were in. Her arms were snug around Agatha's middle as Rio's head landed on her shoulder.</p><p>After only a stunned moment, Agatha's own arms lifted to wrap firmly around Rio, holding her tightly.</p><p><i>"You..."</i> Rio murmured, her lips brushing like a feather over the skin of Agatha's neck, <i>"are an amazing mom."</i></p><p>Agatha's jaw tightened for just a moment before she cleared her throat in order to respond.</p><p><i>"I will be,"</i> Agatha asserted, but she had missed Rio's point, so Rio clarified.</p><p>
<i>"You always have been. That never actually stopped, it just didn't have an opportunity to present itself."</i>
</p><p>Agatha's lips pressed and then shifted, sliding over her teeth to one side as her nose wrinkled in her attempt to compartmentalize emotions that needed to be saved for later. They'd been out a bit later than they had intended and as a result, needed to buckle down on filling out the paperwork for the foster application.</p><p>She gave Rio's side a delicate nudge, a wordless request that she relinquish her grasp so they could move about the house.</p><p>"We should work on the forms. If you grab your iPad, you can go over the prerequisites for a home inspection and I'll get everything filled out. You still have the certificate, right?" Even though she was speaking business, Agatha's voice was quiet and below a normal volume.</p><p>"The one that says we're wives?" Rio posed as she separated them, lifting her head to look up at Agatha with a grin that never failed to stun Agatha for a few passing seconds.</p><p>"Yeah, that one," Agatha responded, her own smile pushing up her cheeks a bit.</p><p>Rio turned and fished it from the coat pocket she had stashed it in before she was facing Agatha again, holding it up triumphantly.</p><p>"Legal documentation that says you're <i>mine,</i>" Rio announced proudly.</p><p>"That's a two way street there, handsome," Agatha teased, plucking it from Rio's fingers as she leaned in to press a kiss to her cheek. "Now, go get your iPad and let's get this done." As she moved past Rio, a hand dropped and gave a light swat at Rio's ass, a tap of encouragement.</p><p>Agatha moved to her desk and opened up her home laptop, but after a moment, she lifted her head to see that Rio was not going to get her iPad. Instead, she wandered into the kitchen and pulled open the refrigerator door. She disappeared behind it as she bent down, but popped up only a moment later. Before Agatha could point out that she'd gotten distracted, her own stomach gave a low rumble.</p><p>"I'm going to put the eggplant parmesan in the oven. We haven't eaten all day," Rio informed her. "And then I will go get my iPad."</p><p>"Thank you, honey," Agatha responded, and while she had initially meant for it to be sarcastic, it missed its mark and landed somewhere a little closer to sincere.</p><p>And so, they had spent their evening with glasses of red wine, eating from their respective places in the living room with Agatha at her desk and Rio propped up against the arm of the couch as they printed forms and pulled up checklists for their newest venture. They had shared occasional and light conversation, but they were both completely focused on the tasks at hand enough to keep it going for too long.</p><p>Agatha had finished the last form of the application; all that was left for them to sign in the designated places and to make a photocopy of the license, which she could do in the morning. She leaned back in her chair and swiveled as she spoke.</p><p>"The last form is don--" She cut herself off immediately as her blue eyes landed on Rio, who was asleep with her iPad still propped on its stand on her stomach. Agatha smiled warmly to herself, that softening returning at the sight of the woman she loved, worn and spent from their day, as she slept on the couch.</p><p>It was the perfect opportunity for Agatha to tend to one more thing.</p><p>She turned back to the laptop and set to work. Agatha pulled up the Petition for Change of Name form and spent about fifteen minutes filling it out, then moved onto the Court Activity Record Information form, which took her another ten. Once she finished, she saw what else she had to send in. It took her only a moment to silently collect her birth certificate from her lockbox and return to her desk.</p><p>Agatha wasn't going to wait for this part, so she figured that she could just do both that and the marriage certificate at the same time. She pulled a compact printer and scanner from its home on a top shelf and took only a few minutes to set it up. First, she scanned the marriage license, and then her birth certificate. When she was satisfied with the scans that had been garnered, she collected everything and put it back in its place.</p><p>She placed herself back in her office chair and finalized all that she had been working on in the secrecy of the night and submitted the paperwork she'd been filling out for the last thirty minutes. She would have sent in the application, too, but that still needed Rio's signature.</p><p>Finally, she shut the laptop and spun slightly in the chair again, her gaze landing once more on her wife.</p><p>Her fucking wife.</p><p>The thought struck her a bit funny as it hit her: not once that day had she become overcome with thoughts of wanting to consummate their marriage. Not one time had Agatha let herself think about the physical, about what it would be like to touch a woman that was only hers by ways of legality. She had not thought about all of the things she would have loved to do to Rio to make her understand how much it all actually meant to her.</p><p>Instead, she sat there and worked out the mechanics of how she was going to get her upstairs and into bed.</p><p>After a few moments of calculation, Agatha pushed herself to her feet and paced over to the couch and was deliberate in her actions. The iPad was lifted and moved to the coffee table before she wedged an arm behind Rio's shoulder blades and one beneath her knees, adjusting to get the leverage she needed. With most of the strength in her middle, she knelt and lifted Rio off the couch. She managed to get back to full height as Rio stirred, but only to wrap her far arm around Agatha's neck, which actually made her easier to carry.</p><p>Agatha exhaled a breath as she reached the top of the stairs, silently thankful for the fact that they were not at Rio's place because that could have ended up way different. As she made it to the bedroom, she was only a little winded by the time she laid Rio atop the plush mattress. The suit jacket had already been shed by Rio sometime after their meal, but Agatha was tender and measured in the way she gently unfastened Rio's trousers and removed them from her legs. She tossed them toward the laundry pile before moving to strip herself down. Once she was finished, she pulled on an old t-shirt and climbed into bed beside Rio, who had rolled to face her edge of the bed.</p><p>With a little finagling, Agatha managed to get the duvet out from under Rio, pulling it up to cover her in only that black tube top and her boy short underwear. Once that was accomplished, Agatha shifted forward on the bed and wrapped an arm around Rio, holding her close.</p><p>Her little spoon.</p><p>As Agatha let her nose nuzzle into the hair on the back of Rio's head, a sentiment that had always made her scoff passed through her mind and she finally understood it.</p><p>
<i>Happy wife, happy life.</i>

<p>Agatha could remember, vaguely, stirring as Rio untangled herself from the grip she had slept soundly in. She had felt, in some dream-like state, as Rio had leaned over the edge of the bed and pressed her lips to Agatha's temple, and then her forehead. She could have even put money on the fact that she heard Rio breathe a soft <i>'I love you, my wife,' </i>just before she placed one last kiss to Agatha's cheek.</p><p>They were all memories dispersed in the fog of a hard sleep that had been much needed. It was the first time Agatha had really let herself relax and stop focusing on anything and everything that was happening, that might happen. She needed to plan, needed to find every avenue that would ensure they got what it was they were trying so hard to obtain, but as she had let herself drift to the scent of Rio's shampoo in her nose she had known that it could wait another day.</p><p>When her consciousness finally chose to seep back into her form, it took her only a couple of moments before she blinked herself into the day, really this time. The bed in front of her was empty which caused her to draw on the monuments in the fog, the memories of those kisses and that soft declaration breathed against warm skin.</p><p>Agatha rolled to her back, an her arm shifting to stretch out across the space between where she was in the middle and her designated edge, though it wasn't in search. It was a subconscious move to take up more space in what was an otherwise empty bed. After the couple of moments it took to fully wake herself up, Agatha's head turned to the side atop her pillow to see a small piece of paper folded atop Rio's pillow.</p><p>Lazily, she raised the arm closest and slid the sheet between her first two fingers and picked the note up, bringing it in front of her face so that she could read it.</p><p>
<i>'My love,</i>
</p><p>
<i>I have a few errands to run but you needed the sleep. I'll text you  when I am finishing up so I can meet you back here before we go to the hospital.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I love you.</i>
</p><p>
<i>-Rio'</i>
</p><p>Agatha read it once, and then again for good measure. For being a doctor, Rio's handwriting was actually rather pretty, when she tried. Agatha had spotted reminder notes here and there and those? They were almost illegible to anyone who wasn't Rio. That note, the one so smooth between her fingertips? That one had effort in it. That one held intent in every flick of the pen she had chosen.</p><p>Agatha shifted, switching the note to her other hand so that she could leave it propped on her nightstand.</p><p>She realized that she had been presented with the perfect opportunity. She had the thought a couple of times since the day before, but she hadn't been able to devote enough time to see it fleshed out. Now, she had time. Now, she could get up and shower and set about her own errand, one that both made her nervous and sent a rush of excitement through her.</p><p>So, she hopped in the shower and spent the time it took to dry her hair and apply a thin layer of makeup before she dressed herself in boot-cut jeans and a periwinkle knit turtleneck sweater. She pulled up her phone and scoured google for a list of the highest recommended jewelers that were within a reasonable distance. When she looked at the specialties of one that was about a twenty-five minute ride away, Agatha had decided upon her destination.</p><p>The car she requested as at the curb less than ten minutes later and she hugged her coat a little closer to her frame as she slid into the back seat and shut the door behind her.</p><p>Her mind was, for once, on one track. She had a general idea of what she was looking for; she didn't want anything extravagant or even too incredibly feminine. Something of that nature would not have been tailored to Rio's personality or to who she was in her career. There were things to be considered and while Agatha had not developed a clear enough mental image of what she was looking for, she knew that she had a good enough feeling that if she saw the right piece, she would know.</p><p>For only a fleeting moment, she thought about texting Rio, asking her what she was up to and what errands she had to run, but she knew that if they got too into conversation, she might feel the need to disclose her own adventure and that was something she did not want to chance or risk.</p><p>The car slowed to a stop in front of the jewelers and she was quick in her exit, sliding a ten dollar bill over the shoulder of the driver with a soft thanks. As she climbed out and made her way inside, she unbuttoned her coat but did not remove it, greeting the clerk with a warm smile as he welcomed her and asked how he could help.</p><p>Agatha had explained to him her purpose, what it was she was looking for, and he had even asked a little bit about Rio and her personality to see if it might lend to finding a better fit. They had gone through a couple; one was gold but had too many diamonds, another silver but too plain. There was one that was too thick and another that wasn't too big in a general sense, but would have been a little too loud for who Rio was.</p><p>There was one he placed on the glass countertop before her and the moment Agatha looked down at it? Her heart squeezed and her breath caught slightly, but not enough that she was not able to make a quick recovery.</p><p>There below her was a white and rose gold ring with a filigree pattern imbued in the white gold over the top. In some of the spaces created by the pattern, there were small set diamonds, totaling in three over the top of the ring. The space around them, it was dark but empty, just the shadows created by the weaving of the metal.</p><p>It was <i>perfect.</i></p><p>It was so... <i>Rio.</i></p><p>The emotion that had so clearly scribed itself across her face was apparent to the other man and he had offered her a warm smile.</p><p>"This is the one, then?" he suggested and Agatha simply nodded her head, eyes still fixed in wonder at the small piece of art in front of her.</p><p>She couldn't wait to see it on Rio's finger every single day.</p><p>It had taken only another ten minutes or so to complete the transaction, in which she had asked that two matching silver chains --one shorter in length -- be added, and Agatha had thanked him sweetly as he handed over the bag and bid her a wonderful rest of her day.</p><p>As she stepped outside, her eyes lifted across the street to a small little cafe she had never heard of before and decided to venture over to grab a warm beverage -- English Breakfast would do if it was all they had -- while she waited for a car.</p><p>When she was almost back to the townhouse, her phone buzzed in her coat pocket and she was quick in her response to produce it. Immediately, she was met with a message notification from Rio that she was on her way back as well.</p><p>Ah, perfect timing.</p><p>She had promptly texted back stating for her to be careful, that Agatha loved her, and that she would see her soon. Only a minute or two after she'd sent the message, the car arrived at its destination and she was back out into the cold air, but only for the time it took her to climb the stairs and let herself inside. She left the door unlocked knowing it wasn't long until Rio would be walking through it as well.</p><p>Agatha shed her coat and paced to the kitchen, almost thoughtless in the way she flipped on the kettle and pulled open the cabinet door to reveal her tea supply. At the same time, the hand that was still clutching the bag raised to set it on the counter. Her eyes scanned over the labeled canisters on the shelf. She initially scanned past the raspberry black tea, but then cut back to it. That was just what she needed. It wouldn't offer much to steady the nerves she was suddenly feeling, but it would taste nice.</p><p>With ease, she pulled it down and filled an infuser -- the axolotl one Rio had surprised her with a while ago -- though the kettle had not yet begun to whistle.</p><p>So, her attention turned back to the bag. It turned back to the inevitable.</p><p>Agatha could not fight the smile that had found her lips as she reached inside and pulled out the small and blue velvet box. She brought her other hand up and opened it, allowing her to take in the sight of that gorgeous ring. The ring she was going to put on her wife's finger right before she told her how much she loved her and gave her a kiss.</p><p>When Agatha had woken up two days prior, there had been no way of knowing that within forty-eight hours, she would not only have found the ability to verbalize her feelings but that she would also be married and actively pursuing an adoption of the sweetest little girl she had ever met.</p><p>Two mornings ago Agatha would have absolutely keeled over at the mere thought of either of those things.</p><p>The Agatha that stood there, looking down at that gorgeous piece of jewelry?</p><p>That Agatha was the happiest she had almost ever been.</p><p>She closed the box and the moment it dropped into her pocket, she could hear as Rio tried her key only to realize that the door was already unlocked. Agatha couldn't hear it through the thickness of the door, but she was all too aware that Rio was probably cursing under her breath.</p><p>The kettle began to whistle just before the door swung open and a wind-blown Rio pressed inside, gently closing it behind her and locking it out of habit.</p><p>"This is that time of year," Rio grunted as she took off her coat and hung it in the closet, "where it acts like it <i>wants</i> to be warm but doesn't try hard enough to get there."</p><p>Agatha grinned, glancing over at her as she kicked off her shoes and made her way toward the kitchen.</p><p>"Would you like a hot cup of tea to warm you up?" she offered as Rio sidled up next to her, a hand landing on the small of her back as Rio stole a quick kiss.</p><p>"You know, I might take you up on that. What kind are you making?"</p><p>"Raspberry black."</p><p>Agatha already knew that if Rio was ever going to drink tea, it would always be black tea. It was something she'd learned in the last few months. Because of that knowledge, she already started to open the drawer.</p><p>"You know me too well," Rio informed her, to which Agatha only responded by swooping in to steal another brief kiss. Glancing down, she saw the small sloth infuser and grabbed it with the slightest twitch of her lips in reflective adoration.</p><p>She'd gone about filling their mugs and had set the infusers inside of each before she picked up both by the handles and nodded her head toward the dining room table.</p><p>The only time was now.</p><p>They both sat close to the corner in a way that enabled their knees to touch as Agatha pushed Rio's mug toward her across the wooden surface. She had been ready to launch into a speech, but before she could even part her lips to speak, Rio was leaning forward as she placed a hand atop Agatha's knee.</p><p>"I... I know this has all been... unconventional, to say the least. But... I've been thinking a lot and there is a moderate sized list of the things I want to do right. The first one on that list is that I feel you should have a proper ring." Rio shifted, her free hand moving toward her pocket. Agatha was watching her, but it felt like she was looking at the moment through a pinhole.</p><p>There was no way. They couldn't be that in sync.</p><p>Rio palmed a little black box, one that she opened with only that hand. She looked down at it, and then back up at Agatha.</p><p>"I have been holding onto this since I was almost eight years old. I have always known that I would find the right person to give it to... And here you are." Rio looked back up at Agatha as she spoke that last sentence and concurrently gave Agatha's knee a firm squeeze. She extended her arm, holding the box out so that Agatha could clearly view its contents.</p><p>It was... <i>absolutely breathtaking.</i></p><p>There, nestled inside velvet, was the most stunning piece of adornment that Agatha had ever laid eyes on. It was clearly an older ring -- which was already slamming into Agatha with brute force, knowing where it had come from -- but it had been well taken care of. In the center was a diamond that, if Agatha had to guess, was nearing 1.5 carats. The top quarter portion of the ring was intricately interlaced lines of silver, ridged and cut in the tiniest ways to provide an additional shine to the ring itself. They were like little vines, just intertwining to provide a perfect cradle for the gem above it.</p><p><i>"Rio..."</i> Agatha whispered, still not able to tear her eyes from the gesture she was being offered. <i>"This... It was your mom's?" </i></p><p>"It was. And I would really like it to be yours, now," she answered, though the sincerity and honest in her tone rang loud and clear.</p><p>Agatha finally managed to break the dead-locked gaze she had on the offering and looked up at Rio instead.</p><p>Rio and those dark honey eyes that shone in just the right light. Rio with that little lopsided smile. Rio who wore flowers in her hair because of the message more than the appearance. Rio who sat there, looking her in the face, offering her a piece of her past to instead make it her future.</p><p>Their future.</p><p>Agatha's response was wordless as she leaned in and pressed their lips together in a loving kiss that she let linger for just a moment longer than she might have otherwise. As they parted and blue eyes were fixed on dark brown ones again, Agatha gave a gentle nod.</p><p>She was not going to offer protest. She was not going to find all the reason Rio shouldn't.</p><p>Rio loved her. She wanted to show Agatha just how deep that ran.</p><p>Who the hell was Agatha to turn that away?</p><p>She lifted her left hand, otherwise bare and watched as -- with a grin as bright as the sun -- Rio pulled the ring from its temporary home and moved to slide it onto Agatha's finger.</p><p>The moment it was there, Rio stilled completely. She was still holding onto Agatha's hand, but her gaze was honed, focused on that sight. Agatha was watching, completely rapt, as the emotion seemed to build itself with every muscle in Rio's face. First it was joy, but then morphed into awe. Before long, the utter reverence had presented. This was clearly a moment Rio had thought about for a very, very long time in the context that she knew she had wanted to find someone worth giving it to, someone worth loving in that way. That look on her face said everything about how justified she felt in making the choice she was making right then.</p><p>And then, she looked back up. What Rio found was an Agatha who was wearing a grin that stretched from ear to her. Her cheeks were pushed so high that it narrowed her eyes, but not in a way that they were unable to convey just how enamored she was in that moment.</p><p>Although Rio tried, Agatha was actually the one to move first, leaning over the corner of the table as she brought her right hand up to cradle Rio's jaw, bringing her in so that she could kiss her again, but it was different. It was a warm kiss, and a full one, but it was loud in its tenderness. It shouted in the way that Agatha wanted it to explain what it was she was feeling for Rio in that moment.</p><p>It was a regression of the best kind. This time, letting her actions speak for her was not a coping skill or a defense mechanism. No, it was the only way she could truly say what she had to say when she felt that what followed was never going to quite cut it. She pulled away, blue eyes fluttering open to gaze upon her wife.</p><p><i>"I love you,"</i> Agatha murmured, tilting her head back just enough so that their lips brushed again in another nearly-there kiss.</p><p><i>"And I love you,"</i> Rio returned in a way that initiated more soft contact of skin as their lips graced through speech.</p><p>In that moment, Agatha made a decision.</p><p>Even though that box in her pocket was burning a hole right through it, it wasn't the right time. There was something about Rio's posture, about the way she had kissed Agatha that told Agatha Rio needed this moment. It was not going to make her sour or feel forgotten about if Agatha did not immediately offer a return of the sentiment. In fact, Agatha could almost guarantee that Rio would have been shocked to hell, and while it would have been enjoyable to see, it didn't feel right.</p><p>This was Rio's time to have, to experience. This was her high to ride out, and Agatha wanted her to have it, every single second of it.</p><p>With one more kiss, Agatha straightened back up and glanced down to their teas, her lips twitching down just slightly.</p><p>"They're over-steeped now," she voiced, though there was a slight inflection of disappointment to her words.</p><p>"We can make more before we leave?" Rio posed sweetly, but the time and come and gone and Agatha's interest in it had waned, especially at the mention of going to the hospital to see Stevie.</p><p>"No, it's okay. We should get going anyway, it's almost two."</p><p>In a series of commonplace motions, Agatha had disposed of the mugs full of now-bitter tea and dumped out the infusers before they were putting their coats back on and heading out into the day.</p><p>The ride to the hospital had been seemingly short in comparison to its usual duration, but Agatha did not complain. Instead, as they wound their way through the hospital, she was nearly bubbling with excitement to see Stevie again.</p><p>As they appeared in the doorway, those little blue-grey eyes lifted and the excitement that sprung to life in that beautiful, sweet face was infectious .</p><p>"Dr. Rio! Ms. Dr. Rio!" she nearly shouted, though at the same time she realized she could not jump out of bed to greet them. The frustration flickered over her expression for just a second before she understood that they would come to her. Both chairs had been left against the wall and the two women were immediate in their grab for them as they placed themselves at Stevie's bedside.</p><p>"Good afternoon, sweetheart," Agatha crooned with a wide grin as she leaned toward Stevie much in the same way she had the night before.</p><p>"Did you have a good sleep?!" Stevie asked excitedly, leaning forward slightly with her hands in her lap, her legs crossed beneath her.</p><p>"We did," Rio told her, that rich voice so smooth and sweet.</p><p>"What about you?" Agatha asked, her eyes bright as Stevie met her gaze. "Did you have some good dreams?"</p><p>"I don't remember them," Stevie admitted in a pout. "I wake up and there's lots of people in here that tell me it's okay and give me apple juice so I can go back to sleep."</p><p>Agatha could feel Rio's posture shift slightly beside her, but Agatha did not have the understanding or context that Rio did to understand the underlying message in what the little girl was telling them.</p><p>What Rio would disclose later was that it was likely Stevie had night terrors.</p><p>Given where they were and what she had experienced to get her there, that would not come as a surprise to Agatha.</p><p>With the way she was situated, Agatha's hands met at a point from where her elbows had come to rest on her thighs again. Her fingers were interlaced, but Stevie's gaze dropped as if to survey which rings she had chosen today. When they landed on the only one she was sporting, Stevie's eyes went wide.</p><p>"Mrs. Dr. Rio," she ventured, but this time Agatha gave her another option if she so chose to use it.</p><p>"You can call me Mrs. Agatha, if you'd like," she offered and Stevie seemed to consider this a moment. It wasn't that Agatha didn't like it or find it so cute that it made her want to combust, but she wanted to offer an avenue of familiarity, something that would provide an ability to get closer instead of remaining so formal.</p><p>"Mrs. Agatha... Where did you get <i>that</i> ring?" Stevie was clearly mystified, taken by the sight of the gorgeous ring Rio had given to her.</p><p>"Dr. Rio gave it to me, actually."</p><p>Agatha unlocked her hands and carefully lifted her left one up so that she could offer it for Stevie's inspection. She took the opportunity immediately and reached for it to pull it a little closer, that curious gaze inspecting every detail.</p><p>"It's so pretty," Stevie marveled aloud, moving Agatha's hand slightly so that the diamond glimmered in the fluorescents overhead. She tore her gaze away and looked to Rio, this time, to offer her approval. "You picked a real nice ring, Dr. Rio. Good job."</p><p>The response to that praise was genuine but soft laughter from the two women who were looking at that little girl like she had put every single star in the sky.</p><p>"Are you gonna stay with me today?" Stevie asked, seeming to switch gears with ease.</p><p>"We are," Rio asserted with a warm nod. "Doctor Julia told me that she brought you some coloring books this morning. So we were thinking that we would color and watch some Bluey with you until dinner time. And... Since I heard you've been really wanting some pizza, I thought we could order some and have dinner before we have to go home later. How do you feel about that plan?"</p><p>"Pizza?!" Stevie squealed, clearly delighted with such a revelation. "Can it have mushrooms and peppers on it!?"</p><p>As was becoming common and frequent, Agatha and Rio both grinned.</p><p>"Is that your favorite?" Agatha asked, the curiosity and excitement filling her face at the realization that this was an opportunity to learn something new, something useful.</p><p>"Yes," Stevie answered with a nod of her head. "Sometimes I like the yellow peppers too but not today."</p><p>There was beauty, Agatha thought, in the simplicity of Stevie's words, though the potency and impact was still there. She called it as it was and left no room for confusion. Agatha could appreciate that.</p><p>"Oh!" Agatha exclaimed as she remembered something. She turned slightly so that she could fish through the pocket of her coat as it rested on the back of her chair. She produced a small baggie that held the chain she had bought earlier in the day. "I got this for you." Agatha opened it and pulled the chain out, letting it dangle in front of her. "We can put your ring on it, since it's too big, that way you can wear it still."</p><p>Stevie instantly became alight with the excitement and Agatha could feel as Rio melted against her arm. The little girl was moving, pulling the ring out from beneath her pillow so that she could produce it to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha took it and as she ran the chain through it, she couldn't help but let her thoughts hinge on the fact that to Stevie, the safest place for the things she loved was under that pillow. When she finished her task, Agatha got to her feet and held up the chain to indicate that she wanted to help Stevie put it on. The little girl leaned forward and Agatha made quick work of fastening it near the base of her neck.</p><p>As she placed herself back in her chair, she looked up to see Stevie looking down at it, completely moved by the gesture. The littler girl looked back up and the expression on her face almost sank Agatha in the way that she looked truly touched. Seeing an a look like that on the face of a five year old was... emotional, to say the least.</p><p>"Thank you Mrs. Agatha," Stevie told her and even for being so little, Agatha could hear the absolute sincerity in those words.</p><p>"You're very welcome, Stevie."</p><p>And so, they had spent their afternoon coloring and watching Bluey; Agatha had developed a fondness for Muffin, in particular, which Rio had laughed at when she voiced how relatable that particular character was.</p><p>They had talked about several things that gave them key pieces of information.</p><p>Stevie's favorite fruit was apples. She liked chicken nuggets, but only dipped in barbeque sauce. Apple juice was good, but grape was better. Her favorite color -- much to Agatha's personal delight -- was purple. She liked going to the park and talked for ten minutes about how she liked playing football with the boys because she got to tackle them. For a five year old, Agatha had to admire that moxie.</p><p>They also learned that Stevie liked music, which she had stated in more simple terms that there was a severe lack of, being in the hospital. She had attempted to hum a couple of the ones she liked, but in that very childlike way, it didn't accomplish much. That could be explored at another time.</p><p>They had ordered pizza and ate as they watched more cartoons, sharing in light conversation as Stevie offered her input on the episode of Teen Titans Go! that they had been watching. Stevie had offered a ringing of giggles when Rio had presented her with the couple of packages of Reese's she had picked up earlier. The day was drawing to a close, though, and they had stayed later than initially intended.</p><p>When they had announced that they were going to have to head home, Agatha was sort of surprised at the lack of disappointment, but she didn't take it personally. Instead, she had recognized it as being a common facet of Stevie's life: People always came and went. That was nothing new for her.</p><p>"Are you going to come back?" Stevie asked them, her eyes darting from Rio to Agatha and back.</p><p>"I work tomorrow, so I will be here first thing in the morning, maybe before you wake up."</p><p>Before Rio could continue, Agatha cut in.</p><p>"And I'm going to try to make it most days, even if I can only stay a little bit," she added, her smile only accentuating just how much she meant what she was saying.</p><p>"I like that," Stevie responded with a bright grin as she reached up to touch the ring hanging from her neck.</p><p>"I'll see you in the morning, okay kiddo?" Rio offered and Stevie answered by way of a firm nod.</p><p>"Goodnight Dr. Rio and Mrs. Agatha."</p><p>"Goodnight, sweet girl. I hope you have the best dreams," Agatha responded, reaching down to give her knee a light pat before they turned and departed.</p><p>The ride home this time was quiet again, but for a different reason. They'd just spent a good chunk of the day in a part of the place Agatha hated most and yet, the discomfort had never crossed her mind. They had been in their little bubble, so absorbed in their mission to learn more about this little girl they had every intention of raising.</p><p>By the time they were shuffling inside and peeling off layers, Agatha could see the exhaustion in Rio's face. Maybe, despite falling asleep early the night before, she had not gotten as much rest as was needed.</p><p>"Do you want to go upstairs and lay down? We don't have to sleep yet, but... I can put on a film if you want. Pour us some bourbon and make some popcorn?" Agatha proposed as she stepped up to Rio, arms sliding around her waist to lock at the small of her back.</p><p>"That sounds wonderful," Rio murmured back, leaning forward to place a light kiss across Agatha's lips.</p><p>Agatha took the kiss happily and even took another, slightly longer, one before she let go of her wife, giving her hip a gentle swat.</p><p>"Go on, go get comfy," she urged with a sweet smile before she stepped away to tend to the task of retrieving alcohol and making popcorn.</p><p>Minutes later, with full hands, Agatha paced into the bedroom where Rio sat, legs covered, with her back against the pillows clad in one of Agatha's Harvard t-shirts. It was a beautiful sight, honestly, and it was one Agatha was certain would stun her every single time. Agatha handed over the popcorn and one of the glasses so that she could put her own down to change into more comfortable clothes.</p><p>Once everything was accomplished, she slid into bed next to Rio, who set the popcorn on the surface provided by the way their thighs were pressed together.</p><p>They had shared in a brief discussion over what location was going to be prime in raising Stevie and had ultimately decided by the end of the beginning credits to the film that it would be Rio's home. When Rio had informed Agatha that she did could and maybe should keep the home they were currently in, Agatha had given a nod but hadn't offered a vocal answer. She knew what Rio was doing, but she didn't need it. She didn't want this place anymore if she had somewhere new, somewhere better, to sink those roots of hers into.</p><p>It had been an evening that was so different in tone from many of the ones that had come before it, but it was also peaceful in its own right. There was something calming about just watching a movie and enjoying the silence together.</p><p>Eventually, Rio had grown tired, leaning into Agatha a bit more. Agatha had wrapped an arm around her and held her close, but within minutes of making the gesture, Rio had fallen asleep. Agatha let her stay like that for a few moments but quickly decided that the arrangement they were in had to make it uncomfortable.</p><p>The moment she got Rio laid down, though, a thought hit her. Before she snuggled in for sleep, there was something Agatha wanted to accomplish. She carefully climbed out of that big bed and reached into the pocket of her discarded jeans and pulled out that little blue box. She removed the ring from inside of it and crawled back onto the bed, reaching to pick up Rio's left hand carefully and in a way that did not wake her.</p><p>With measured precision, Agatha slid the beautiful ring onto Rio's finger and placed a soft kiss to her temple before she, too, laid down and succumbed to slumber.</p><p>Violently, Agatha was ripped from her sleep and shoved into consciousness at the feeling of a heavy weight suddenly being thrust down upon her. Before she could gather enough sense to understand why, she felt as there was contact to several different points on her face. The more she came-to, the more she began to process what was happening.</p><p>Rio was on top of her. Rio was also peppering kisses all over her face.</p><p>Agatha groaned, shifting beneath Rio to lay on her back, sinking further into the mattress as both of their weights settled.</p><p><i>"Rioooo, what are you doing?"</i> Agatha grumbled as Rio continued to kiss at her face, though Agatha made no move to swat her away.</p><p><i>"I am loving on you in appreciation,"</i> Rio murmured. <i>"I found your gift as I was getting ready to shower."</i></p><p><i>"Mmm,"</i> Agatha managed, finally able to bring her eyes to open. <i>"It's not a gift, though. It's a promise."</i></p><p>Looking up at her, Agatha could see that Rio was filled with love and it showed on every visible bit of her. It was in the way her weight sank down a little more, in the way her eyes sparkled in the dim light of the room as the sun made its climb into the sky. It was in the way her lips curled up in something that felt like it was more than just a smile.</p><p>Instead of any sort of rebuttal, though, Rio simply kissed her, full-on this time.</p><p>It started out tender, sweet even. And then, there was the familiar heat of their attraction to one another as it began to seep through Rio's lips and into Agatha's own. Rio's lips moved with intent, latching and sucking. After a moment longer, Agatha felt as Rio's teeth sank into her flesh and gave a soft tug, a more forceful request for entrance.</p><p>Of course, Agatha obliged and her lips parted only to be met with the guest of Rio's tongue as it entered her mouth. It was a hot kiss, a passionate exchange, but there was also this intense underlying sense of love that made it more tender than was normal for the two of them.</p><p>It drew on like that for minutes until Rio seemed to realize that she was sacrificing the time she needed to get ready for work. Although she did not immediately tear herself away, Agatha was still dissatisfied as Rio slowly removed the contact and looked down at her.</p><p>
<i>"I have to get ready for work. But thank you. I love it."</i>
</p><p>Agatha's brow pinched. No, no! That wasn't fair! She didn't just get to throw herself at Agatha -- literally -- and then run off to work!</p><p><i>"Rio! No!"</i> Agatha tried to combat, but Rio was already flat-footed and pacing toward the bathroom, knowing that she could not engage without making herself even later.</p><p>Agatha sat up, watching as Rio disappeared around the edge of the doorway and turned the water on a beat later.</p><p>Oh no, that was not how this was going to go.</p><p>Agatha was out of the bed in the blink of an eye, hands flying down to frantically grasp at the hem of her shirt right before she tore it off of her torso and tossed it aside, missing the way it landed on the handle of the open door to the bedroom.</p><p>As she charged into the bathroom, Rio was stepping into the standing shower and at the same time, her hand on the glass door as if she was going to close it.</p><p>"I don't think so!" Agatha announced, stepping in right behind her in a way that made Rio let go of the door so Agatha took up the space with her own hand instead. Once she was fully inside, she pulled it shut and turned back to Rio who was half a step into trying to turn around. Before she could, though, Agatha placed her hands on Rio's hips and stepped into her, forcing her forward until her front was pressed against the cool stone of the shower wall.</p><p>"Agatha!" Rio cried in surprise, though she did not offer any resistance.</p><p>Agatha's head dropped and her lips fell to the skin that covered the crook of Rio's neck, pressing warm but hungry kisses there.</p><p><i>"Agatha, I'm going to be late for work,"</i> Rio tried to argue, but there was a huskiness to the sound of her voice as it carried over the shower.</p><p><i>"I can be quick,"</i> Agatha nearly growled voraciously, her hand moving toward where Rio's stomach was pressed to the wall but she stopped, silently asking for permission. If Rio insisted that she really did need to get ready for work, they could both shower and even though Agatha would be charged and frustrated, it wasn't anything she wouldn't be able to work out herself.</p><p>She got what she was after, though.</p><p>
<i>"How quick?" </i>
</p><p>Agatha's smirk happened in a flash.</p><p><i>"That depends on you, darling,"</i> Agatha purred against Rio's neck.</p><p>Rio shifted slightly in a manner that afforded Agatha the space she needed to reach forward to Rio's stomach. With intent but not in a hurried manner, Agatha's hand ventured lower as her teeth grazed Rio's shoulder.</p><p>The moment her fingers found their destination between Rio's legs, she felt as they parted a bit more, feet sliding a bit on the shower floor. Once there, Agatha pressed her hips forward so that her arm was purposefully pinned between Rio and the wall.</p><p>Although Agatha was aware she had been put on a time crunch, she still took a moment to bask in the feeling of getting to be this close to Rio after a few nights without sharing in such intimacy, especially since those nights had both been since they had gotten married. Her fingers were gentle in their exploration, sliding between Rio's lips to part them the slightest bit.</p><p>A breathless gasp slipped out of the woman before her and it caused her to grin wildly against the contact of her lips to Rio's skin. With her left hand, she picked up Rio's left one as well and pressed them both to the wall, Rio's palm to the stone and Agatha's flat against the back of Rio's limb.</p><p>Her touch sank lower, delving into the warmth of Rio's wet sex as her kisses began to trail up the side of Rio's neck. She had just started a rhythmic caress as her lips reached Rio's ear. The same moment she breathed her sentiment into Rio's ear, her fingers clutched at Rio's hand, causing the metal of their rings to clink in a way that was just loud enough to be heard over the stream of water dispersing from the showerhead.</p><p>
<i>"I love you, my wife."</i>
</p><p>In the following seconds, Agatha found herself experiencing the most intense mix of both shock and complete amusement. With the way their bodies were compacted against the wall, she felt every inch in Rio's form as it tensed and then released, followed a moment later by a low and guttural moan as it thundered out of Rio's lungs.</p><p>Okay, so that was pretty fucking hot.</p><p>Agatha placed a kiss to Rio's ear, and then her cheek.</p><p><i>"Told you,"</i> she murmured against Rio's skin, a smirk curling her lips before she pulled away. She gave Rio's hip a firm squeeze and placed a light kiss to where her neck met her back. <i>"Get ready for work, love."</i> With a quick smack to Rio's right ass cheek, Agatha departed the shower and slid the door shut behind her, making quick work of drying herself off.</p><p>She considered redressing but almost instantly decided that she was going to utilize the footage of those few moments that had been recorded and stored in her mind for her own personal benefit once Rio left. So instead, she dumped herself back into bed, her mind nearly floating away with how <i>hot</i> that actually was. It had taken the slightest touch and an affirmation of things Rio both loved and needed to hear and she had come completely undone. Agatha had gotten what she wanted in no time at all and Rio got the bonus of having a slight surge in dopamine and serotonin before she took on work for the day.</p><p>Rio had emerged, dressed in her scrubs -- which only seemed to lend to the dull throb between Agatha's legs -- and leaned over the bed to kiss her.</p><p><i>"I would tell you to keep the day holy, but you already shot that in the face."</i> Rio's grin was wide and wicked both before and after she placed her kiss to Agatha's lips.</p><p><i>"Oh, didn't you know? I am entirely devoid of holiness. I tend to the devil's work," </i>Agatha teased, a playful gleam in her eye. <i>"Go to work. Tell Stevie I miss her and I'll be in before you're off to come see her."</i></p><p>A sense of excitement seemed to crackle through Rio like a jolt of electricity.</p><p>"You're coming in today?"</p><p>Agatha's grin eased into a smile and she gave a light but affirming nod.</p><p><i>"I'll see you later, Rio. I love you."</i> Agatha leaned up enough to snatch one last kiss before Rio straightened back up.</p><p>"I love you too, Agatha. If you come at lunch I could really use a quinoa protein bowl from the eatery down the road from the hospital."</p><p>"Anything for you, my love."</p><p>*****</p><p>The following days were a constant blur of Stevie, Rio, work, repeat and it was something that offered more bliss to Agatha than she had thought she was ever capable of feeling. It was peaceful to wake up to the sound of Rio getting ready for work before she joined the fray of doing the same. It was calming to get through her work days, though a couple of her students had made comments about the rock she was now sporting on her left hand. It was fulfilling to step into that hospital and head straight for that room, brimming with happiness and adoration the moment she laid spectacled eyes on Stevie.</p><p>That Thursday in particular, Agatha had not gotten much sleep the night before. There wasn't anything wrong, necessarily, but her mind kept turning over everything they had accomplished in the last week or so. She thought about having turned in the application that Monday and how they were officially in the throes of the process now. Now, it was a waiting game. It was one Agatha could play by showing up to that hospital to establish the fact in Stevie's eyes that they were not going anywhere.</p><p>Agatha had departed her office after locking up forty-five minutes early and made her way straight to the hospital, picking up a veggie wrap for Rio's lunch and making an extra stop to grab Stevie a box of chicken nuggets, sure to ask for extra barbeque sauce.</p><p>She had arrived, greeted Rio with a kiss and made her way to surprise Stevie with the treat. Agatha had watched the little girl devour them hungrily, making sure to thank Agatha between each nugget, which caused her to chuckle each time and insist Stevie did not have to keep thanking her.</p><p>When she was done, Agatha had thrown away the trash and turned her chair a little so she could see the television better. They settled on some cartoon Agatha had never heard of before and had set to watching. About twenty minutes in, Agatha had been unable to stifle a large yawn, though she covered her mouth to try and disguise it.</p><p>Stevie didn't miss a damn thing, though.</p><p>"Mrs. Agatha?" her little voice came from just over Agatha's shoulder. Blue eyes turned to land on that sweet and curious face, her chin tipping in acknowledgement. "Are you sleepy?"</p><p>Agatha's heart squeezed in her chest. This felt all too familiar and yet, still so different.</p><p>"I am a little," Agatha answered, though as she did, Stevie yawned too. "I looks like you might be, too."</p><p>Stevie raised her good hand and wiped at her eye, nodding her head.</p><p>"Do you wanna lay down with me Mrs. Agatha? We can take a nap."</p><p>Too familiar, but so very different.</p><p>It took Agatha less than thirty seconds to make her decision.</p><p>"I would like that, if you're sure."</p><p>"I'm sure, Mrs. Agatha."</p><p>Stevie was moving in an instant, shuffling over enough so that there was room for Agatha to climb into the bed with her.</p><p>Agatha was careful in the way she moved, in the way she folded herself onto that bed next to Stevie. Her left hand came to lay on her stomach and while she had extended her other arm across the pillows, it was like being struck with lightning the moment Stevie seemed to fold right into her.</p><p>Her breath caught near the bottom of her lungs and she honestly felt like she might pass out. That wasn't just big. It was <i>huge.</i> This little girl who had suffered endlessly at the hands of many was seeking out physical comfort from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha knew what that was like, to find the <i>one</i> person that felt safe to be pressed up against. The fact that Stevie was choosing <i>her</i> to be that person? It was throttling her into a headspace where both dreams were coming true and she was also fighting to maintain her perspective that this was her reality.</p><p>They'd sat like that for a little while, but Agatha's exhaustion had pulled her under.</p><p>While she slept, Rio had appeared in the doorway to check on them. Stevie was still against Agatha's side and had been in the process of playing with her wedding ring when she noticed Rio standing there. Stevie never could have read it, but Rio's expression at the sight of Agatha in the bed, asleep, with Stevie stuck to her? She was ready to completely crumble.</p><p>Rio paced into the room and placed herself in the chair Agatha had previously been occupying.</p><p>"Mrs. Agatha was sleepy," Stevie informed her, "so I asked her if she wanted to take a nap with me but... I'm not sleepy anymore."</p><p>"That's okay, Stevie. But... if you need anything and I'm not here, it's okay to wake her up, alright?" Rio informed her softly.</p><p>"I will, Dr. Rio." She glanced up at Agatha for a moment before she met Rio's dark honey gaze again. "Mrs. Agatha is really nice. I like it when she visits me 'cause you're working."</p><p>Rio fought the urge to melt.</p><p>"Well, she likes coming to visit you, too. So she's probably going to for a while, if that's okay."</p><p>Stevie nodded.</p><p>"I want that," she told Rio, her childlike smile warm and honest.</p><p>"We both do, too, kiddo."</p>

<p>The weeks were wearing on at an accelerated pace, but the pieces were not plummeting down into place. Agatha had known that this was a process, that it was going to take time, but when the day had finally come and the social worker had informed Rio that Stevie was going to be placed in a new home while they waited for their application to be approved?</p><p>Agatha had been crushed. She had spent too many hours to count coloring and watching cartoons and eating chicken nuggets, too many days locking up her office early so that she could beeline it to the hospital.</p><p>The night Rio had come home with the news that they'd had no other choice than to discharge her, Agatha had kept it together but Rio had not.</p><p><i>"There was nothing I could do,"</i> Rio had cried from her place curled against Agatha's chest.</p><p><i>"I know, Rio. It's okay. We knew this could happen,"</i> she tried to soothe, but it only seemed to make Rio cry more. It was a state of being that pained Agatha to see; Rio was always so strong, but to see her fall apart like that? It was the first time Agatha had truly felt shattered in any way when it came to their relationship.</p><p>
<i>"We're going to get it right. We're making all the right choices. We're going to figure it out."</i>
</p><p>Rio had fallen asleep on Agatha's chest that night, pressed to the tear-soaked t-shirt beneath her cheek. Only after she was certain that Rio was too exhausted to stir, Agatha had let herself cry, too.</p><p>They had tried to do so much, tried to better their chances, but it didn't change the process. Rio had spoken with the social worker a couple of times; they kept a pretty open line of communication. The woman seemed to like Rio and see that this was exactly what this little girl needed, and she'd indicated that she'd done her best to get their application pushed through the proper channels. She'd told Rio to hang on a little bit longer in order to try for an estimated approval date, and she had also insisted for them to keep doing all that they were doing in order to prepare.</p><p>They'd signed up for and consequently started taking the preservice classes. They totaled ten 3 hour classes and they were taking two a week so they were able halve the duration to five weeks instead of ten.</p><p>She and Rio had <i>bought a fucking car.</i> It was a midsize SUV that could seat five with reasonable space in the back. It was the smart and sensible thing to do, but Agatha had not been behind the wheel of a vehicle in... at least fifteen years.</p><p>A driving refresher course or three in an empty parking lot had been in order, and even though it had included quite a bit of harassment from Rio and goading about how she'd done donuts in her pickup in a convenience store parking lot every winter during med school, by the end of it she had gotten Rio's stamp of safe driver approval.</p><p>That ordeal had also included a conversation about Agatha needing to get her license, one that came about in the gravel drive next to Rio's condo.</p><p>"I already got it," Agatha said casually.</p><p>"You got your license for the first time in years... Before you knew you were buying a car? Why?" Rio questioned, and there it was.</p><p>It had only been a week since she'd received it in the mail, but with usual Agatha panache, she had decided to try and find the right time to tell Rio. Instead, the right time had found her then and there.</p><p>"I needed to get a new one anyway. I even had to take the stupid written test again," Agatha informed her as she pulled her wallet out of the center console and slid the card out and flipped it out between her first two fingers toward Rio. "They could have taken a better picture, though."</p><p>Her blue gaze lifted to glance across to Rio in the passenger's seat who was reading the information on the ID... over and over again.</p><p><i>"Agatha... You changed your last name?" </i>Rio breathed, the disbelief heavy over her words even though she was staring at and holding solid proof right there in her hands.</p><p>"I did," Agatha affirmed with a nod. "Agatha Vidal just... has a ring to it, don't you think?"</p><p>Rio had finally looked up at her and the sheer amount of emotion that had poured into every bit of her expression struck Agatha directly in the chest, knocking the breath right out of her.</p><p>"Why did you really do it?" Rio asked her, finding a bit more strength to weave into her tone.</p><p>"Because, Rio, we're going to be a family. A show of unity before that actively becomes a possibility is nice, but... More than that, I'm yours. And... Thanks to Stevie, I'm quite fond of being called 'Mrs. Dr. Rio.'" Agatha's smile had been wide and bright, the adoration in her eyes clear.</p><p>The way Rio had leaned across the space between those seats and pulled her into a kiss had told Agatha every bit of what she needed to know.</p><p>She'd made the right decision.</p><p>In the couple of weeks since, Rio had suggested for her to take a deep breath as her temper flared quite a few times. Rio had also let out at least two <i>'It's not that serious'</i>s when Agatha got irritated with the way someone else was driving. Each time Agatha had to fight to keep her eyes on the road ahead, otherwise she would have freely launched daggers from them at her wife in the passenger's seat.</p><p>After four weeks without Stevie and seven since they'd gotten married, though Rio had been getting feedback that she was doing alright in the new placement -- and added that she was still occasionally asking about them -- with only minor issues, they were still working toward the big goal. In the same update, the social worker had indicated that their application had shifted to the 'in review' status after both of their background checks had cleared.</p><p>That was good news. That was very good news. They would undoubtedly be called in for an interview, which they would spend time prepping for a couple of nights a week once they finished their last week of classes. The woman had informed Rio that it could still be several weeks, but that she was hopeful it would be fewer than that.</p><p>That weekend, Rio had taken Sunday off so that she and Agatha would have both days in order to not only salvage whatever Agatha wanted from her own townhome -- which they had tackled for the most part Friday evening -- before it sold, but also set to prepping Rio's condo for the inevitable home visits with Stevie, banking on the fact that they were going to get approved.</p><p>Saturday, the two of them had gone about the bulk of the work, managing to make headway on the list of tasks Rio had written out for them to handle.</p><p>The last room to tackle was the one that was going to be Stevie's. It was on the third floor and just down the hall and to the left from their bedroom. The paint had been bought, the wall decorations had been purchased. The bed and mattress had both been ordered and they were going to move a couple of the smaller dressers from another room into that one. Agatha had even purchased a gliding rocking chair at Rio's behest, suggesting that it could be used for soothing an upset Stevie.</p><p>Agatha had not known if that was some tidbit of doctor knowledge or if it was just a gut feeling, but she had not questioned it and purchased it nonetheless.</p><p>Getting the room cleared out was a task to be managed, though. There were totes and boxes stacked against a far wall and while it wasn't a lot, Rio had indicated that some of it needed to be sorted through.</p><p>Once they finished their dinner around eight that evening, they had set to work. Most of the things that had been packed away were things Rio still needed to keep and so they were emptied of the unnecessaries and relocated to a different room. Agatha had been going through the last totes when she lifted a book out and a few photos spilled from between the pages. One fell back into the tote and the other landed face-down by Agatha's knee.</p><p>Casually, she reached down to pick it up and turned it over so that she could look at it. What she saw made her grin from ear to ear.</p><p>There, on a 3x4 was a photo of Rio, who looked to be around twenty-five or so. In it, a pair of red basketball shorts were just visible at the bottom of the frame, hanging low on her hips. Her torso was almost entirely bare except for the black string bikini top that tied around the back of her neck. A pair of darkly tinted aviators were on her face and a backwards black ball cap sat atop her head. Her shoulder length hair was damp, and the most noticeable thing aside from the red solo cup in her hand was her mouth open and tongue flat as it hung out.</p><p>Something deep in Agatha stirred, but she tried to bat it away for the time being.</p><p>But...<i> Gods be damned if that wasn't attractive as hell.</i></p><p>She knew it was Rio in a past life, Rio who had needed times like that one to cut loose from the pressure of her education.</p><p>While Agatha was used to Rio wearing suits and being the handier one of the two of them, this was a different side of her that she did not show nearly as often as Agatha immediately decided she should. Of course, it would ultimately be Rio's choice, but if Agatha got any input whatsoever?</p><p>She wanted more of pick-up truck driving, backwards ball cap wearing, red solo cup drinking, tongue out Rio.</p><p>Immediately.</p><p>She had stared at that photo for gods knew how long until the sound of Rio clearing her throat behind her caused her to snap out of her haze. Her head jerked up and she looked over her shoulder, her expression sheepish as she realized that her wife was actually a lot closer than she had initially surmised. Instead of being by the doorway, she was about a foot behind Agatha, which caused her to look up a bit awkwardly from where she was sitting.</p><p>"Hi," she offered, lowering the photo to her lap as she offered a half-faux, half-busted smile.</p><p>"Whatcha lookin' at?" Rio posed, hands in her jogger pocket as she rocked forward onto the balls of her feet in an all-too-eager manner.</p><p>"Just found a picture," Agatha replied, giving a slight shrug of her shoulders as if said picture had not caused a slight thrumming of a steady beat between her legs.</p><p>"Yeah? What of?" Rio prodded, already having spotted what was in Agatha's hand.</p><p>Finally, Agatha's attention turned back to the photo now in her lap and she grinned at it.</p><p>"It's just a picture of someone I would have <i>definitely</i> let put a baby in me."</p><p>Even Agatha was choosing to ignore the deeper meaning of what she said; they didn't need to have that conversation again, especially right then as Agatha was attempting to tame the wild beast inside of her that was suddenly fighting to erupt from any fissure it could tear in her skin.</p><p>Behind her, Rio audibly sputtered.</p><p><i>"Agatha, what?!"</i> Rio nearly choked, though she did not move from her spot.</p><p>Agatha looked back at her again, that grin returning but this time with far more intensity and far more mischievousness.</p><p>"You heard me. I'd have let you put a baby in me looking like that."</p><p>"Agatha -- I -- That's --" Rio stammered, the heat on her cheeks visible even from Agatha's poor angle. "That's not how that works!"</p><p>"Pfft," Agatha blew out in challenge. "And how do you know?" she asked, fully aware she was being an absolute little shit. "Have you ever tried?"</p><p>"What do you mean, 'have I ever tried?' It's <i>physically</i> impossible," Rio managed back, exasperated.</p><p>Agatha knew this, obviously, but she was having the time of her life getting under Rio's skin. She turned back to give the appearance that she was busying herself again, but her words were pointed in their taunting.</p><p>"So that would be a resounding 'No, Agatha, I have not ever tried.'"</p><p>Rio opened her mouth, but only a croak came out. She tried again, but it was a high-pitched squeak that Agatha was sure was meant to be some word or another, but never made it past the stage of being merely a noise. The next sound was two at once as Rio both let out a grunt and kicked her foot against the floor.</p><p>"You okay back there, handsome?" Agatha cooed, though she didn't look up from her job of removing the rest of the books from the tote.</p><p>"I'm <i>fine,</i>" Rio managed, but her tone was tight and the words were spoken through clenched teeth. Agatha's grin only seemed to grow.</p><p>"You're thinking about it, aren't you?" Agatha probed, her tone light but playful in its teasing.</p><p>"About how I cannot biologically get you pregnant? No, I am not thinking about that," Rio answered, tone still tight but a little flatter.</p><p>"No, you're thinking about trying, though."</p><p>At this, she could almost feel the harsh huff of breath that Rio exhaled and if Agatha had to bet? If she turned around right that instant, she was surely going to catch Rio as red as a tomato.</p><p>What Agatha could not hear was the internal struggle going on inside of Rio. All Agatha could see in front of her was a snapshot of her wife in her younger years, carrying about an aura that screamed absolute sex appeal. What Agatha did not see there was that it was a projection of an angry-at-the-world Rio who, like Agatha, had chosen poor ways to cope in her grief. The things not visible in that photo were things Rio had kept repressed for some time, and she'd needed to find her footing to make a decision on whether or not she was going to cave to Agatha's demand.</p><p>There was the softest shuffling, and for a moment Agatha wondered if Rio might actually bail. Had she said something wrong? Had she touched a nerve she didn't mean to touch?</p><p>Above her, Rio stood in a hot debate that did not touch Agatha's ears. Looking down at Agatha as she sat on the floor, Rio found confidence in the fact that they had come so far so fast. She had faith in the fact that in the same way Agatha could shed her armor, Rio could find a part of herself long forgotten, too, and trust that it was safe in Agatha's possession.</p><p>As the silence drew on between them, Agatha felt the need to fill it.</p><p>"So... you just gonna stan-- Hey!" she yelped in surprise as she felt all at once as Rio's hand found the back of her head and fisted a handful of hair, jerking her head back. Rio was leaning over and their faces were not all that far apart; Rio had been measured in where she had pulled Agatha, that much was clear.</p><p>Rio had finally made her decision.</p><p>But she probably had not been expecting the look of vicious triumph on Agatha's face or the devious gleam in her eye as the next words rolled off her tongue.</p><p>"There's my tough guy," she hummed, her grin so wide it was touching both eyes.</p><p><i>"Agatha," </i>Rio growled at her.</p><p>"Yes, sweetie?" Agatha offered back, her sultry tone dripping with undeniable want.</p><p><i>"You are so goddamn frustrating," </i>Rio asserted, as if Agatha were completely unaware.</p><p>Agatha licked her lips, eyes boring heatedly into Rio's.</p><p>
<i>"Are you gonna knock me up or what?"</i>
</p><p>With another growl, Rio bent down lower at the same time she pulled Agatha's hair again, both causing a satisfied moan to slip from her lips and pushing her to comply with the movement. The moment she did, Rio kissed her though it was actually quite hilarious. It was, Agatha thought, very Spider-Man-esque in the way they were positioned and she couldn't help but deliver a giggle into Rio's mouth the moment her lips parted to initiate more contact.</p><p>In return, Rio's grip tightened and she gave another pull as she removed the contact of their mouths. That left Agatha pouting as her eyes flew open to take in the sight of her wife in an attempt to gauge just how close Agatha had pushed her into considering it.</p><p>The moment Rio let go of her hair, her bottom lip jutted out further and a low whine escaped her, the disappointment wrinkling her forehead the slightest bit.</p><p><i>"Get up,"</i> Rio ordered. From where she sat, looking at an upside-down Rio, Agatha could feel the very spot in her stomach where every bit turned to molten lead.</p><p>Unable to resist, Agatha raised a hand in salute.</p><p>"Yes, sir!" she returned, flinging her arm before stopping it mid-swing to complete the gesture.</p><p>"Agatha!" Rio pushed in a commanding tone.</p><p>"Alright, alright," Agatha grumbled mockingly, getting to her feet. Before she could offer a rebuttal or even a word of taunting, Rio had grabbed her wrist and practically dragged her out of that spare room and right down the hall to their bedroom.</p><p>Rio knew what Agatha knew: It wasn't so often that Agatha flipped this switch on and now that the lights were shedding a full view of the opportunity she was presenting to Rio, all Rio had to do was take it.</p><p>It had been blatantly obvious that Agatha had caught her off guard. They were both well aware that no matter what happened that night, she was not going to actually wind up pregnant. However, that didn't mean that Rio couldn't put forth her best effort, did it?</p><p>Something about seeing that photo, about seeing her wife look like that, it had spiked Agatha's pulse and shot her heart rate right up.</p><p>Rio was hot. That was an irrefutable fact of the universe.</p><p><i>That</i> Rio, the one she saw in that picture?</p><p>That Rio could do the most unimaginable things to her and she one-hundred percent would have offered not a single protest. Agatha knew it was completely insane. She knew that giving <i>that </i>much over could be risky, but what did she really have to lose at that point? They had committed months ago at that point, and she knew that neither of them had plans to a) hurt one another, or b) run. They were a foundation in their solidity, and if she could yank at Rio's chain for a night of fun when neither of them had to work the next morning?</p><p>Would she be Agatha Vidal if she did not?</p><p>Absolutely not.</p><p>Intentionally, she was offering the tiniest bit of resistance as Rio pulled her down the hallway which only caused Rio's grip to tighten and tug even harder. It was only riling Agatha up that much more, which was exactly what she was wishing to inflict upon herself.</p><p>She was spinning the top between her fingertips, watching as the line of who Rio was began to wind tighter and tighter.</p><p>By the time they crossed the threshold into the bedroom, Rio wasted not even a second as she yanked Agatha forward and then shoved her back to the wall on the other side of the doorframe. Agatha gasped, her eyebrows shooting up slightly at first, but then hiking up to mountain peaks as Rio reached up quickly and fastened her grip on either side of Agatha's jaw.</p><p>Agatha was very aware of both places, on either side of her jaw where that give of flesh existed just on the inside of bone, where Rio's thumb on one side and the middle knuckle of her finger on the other landed and pressed.</p><p>The smirk Agatha wore in the blink of an eye was bordering on feral but she was not ready to give up on challenging Rio quite yet. She wanted to erase that doubt, wanted to make sure that there was no question what she wanted. Her hips lifted off of the wall as she spoke, pressing toward Rio's in desperation.</p><p>
<i>"That's it?"</i>
</p><p>The moment Rio heard her, her own hips jerked forward, pinning Agatha back to the wall. Her face was suddenly so close that Agatha could smell the faint remnants of their evening bourbon there on her breath.</p><p><i>"What the hell has gotten into you?" </i>Rio questioned lowly, but the tones she chose sounded more hungry than disbelieving.</p><p>Agatha's smirk grew.</p><p><i>"Not you, yet,"</i> she mused back, tongue poking out to swipe across her lips.</p><p>That seemed to do the trick. Rio surged forward and their mouths collided in a pure show of force. Her grip tightened, sinking further into Agatha's skin in a way that sent a thrill rushing through her.</p><p>Rio wasn't even choking her and she could have just about come undone on the spot, even before Rio's tongue practically shoved its way into her mouth. She met the contact happily, providing adequate defense as her own tongue pressed back. Agatha lost that battle the moment Rio applied an upward force on her hold.</p><p>Before Agatha could even think, Rio's free hand had slipped beneath the fabric of her baseball tee and met the warm skin of her side.</p><p>A slightly jagged moan clawed its way up Agatha's throat and over Rio's tongue before it slid down Rio's throat with ease, delicious across every single taste bud it touched. Rio's hand was compelled to move and slid up the swath of Agatha's skin beneath her fingertips until they dug slightly into the skin of Agatha's ribs so that they could keep moving beneath the bottom hem of her bra.</p><p>The very second that Rio's palm made contact with Agatha's breast and she gave a firm squeeze, Agatha clenched in an attempt to stave off the orgasm that she could feel brewing low in her belly. She might have considered pulling away, pleading with Rio to just get on with it, but with the way Rio had her pinned, there was assuredly nowhere for her to go.</p><p>Rio's hand was moving again, but only to pull Agatha's now erect nipple between her fingers, pinching and twisting. Concurrently, Rio's tongue swiped along the roof of her mouth. Agatha had been caught up in all of that, so caught up that by the time Rio forcefully asserted her hips into Agatha's again, Agatha internally cursed -- both at herself and at the sudden orgasm that she felt as it forced tension into her muscles -- but all that actually came out was a high-pitched moan that rattled both sets of teeth.</p><p>The moment her body went slack, pinned between Rio's and the wall, Rio withdrew her tongue and finally pulled their lips apart, leaving a panting Agatha limp for just a moment. The only way she was even still standing was because she was not supporting her own weight.</p><p>Then, Rio spoke.</p><p>
<i>"That's it?"</i>
</p><p>
<i>Oh.</i>
</p><p>That was how she was going to play?</p><p>That was a match dropped onto the wick of a stick a dynamite. It was a stick of dynamite that had Agatha's name written all over it.</p><p>Agatha's head snapped forward off the wall and she caught Rio's lip between her teeth, biting down with a measured force, but still rather rough in comparison to that action in previous exchanges.</p><p>A groan erupted out of Rio and her hand moved to damn near claw at the breast beneath it. A sound similar escaped Agatha and she finally had enough.</p><p>This was taking too long.</p><p>Agatha raised her hands and curled her fingers around Rio's shoulders at the top of her biceps and used enough force to push her back at the same time she released her hold on Rio's lip.</p><p>The same moment Rio stepped back, her hands whipped up at lightning speed and grabbed hold of Agatha's forearms, her eyes flashing as she pinned Agatha with her gaze. There was this expression that settled into her face, one that Agatha couldn't read at first. After a moment, she realized what it was.</p><p>Rio was finding her, that woman, that med student she had once been. Agatha had opened the door and Rio had been standing at the edge, peering inside to gauge if she was actually being given permission to run straight through it.</p><p>From where Agatha stood, she was holding fistfuls of green flags, waving them around fervently in a way that could have not been more apparent.</p><p>In a move Agatha had not anticipated, Rio just... let her go.</p><p>Momentarily, Agatha just blinked at her.</p><p>And then, Agatha's jaw fell open as Rio stepped backward until the backs of her thighs hit the edge of the mattress and she sat atop it, leaning back on her arms. What kept the moment over the heat, though, was the look on her face as her gaze slowly traversed Agatha from head to toe and back up again.</p><p>Agatha could see what Rio was doing. It was both an exercise in her own imagination and also a silent dare for Agatha to show initiative if she really wanted what she was asking for.</p><p>"What?" Agatha shot, her chest still rising and falling a bit faster than normal. "You want a show?"</p><p>Rio's grin was sweeping and devilish.</p><p>"Nope. But you can still undress yourself."</p><p>Agatha's jaw screwed tight for a moment as she debated such a challenge. It took her all of a few seconds to decide how she wanted to react.</p><p>"If that's the case and you don't need to watch, don't you have your own disrobing to tend to?" Agatha posed, making no move to strip her shirt over her head, the dare obvious in her eyes.</p><p>Immediately, Rio's face fell and her brow pinched. She clearly had not been anticipating <i>that</i> kind of pushback. "What --?" she managed, as if she were suddenly realizing her miscalculation. Agatha simply lifted her hands in an exaggerated shrug before she glanced back toward the closet momentarily and then cut back to Rio, her smirk instant.</p><p><i>"Oh,"</i> Agatha managed, as if it had suddenly dawned on her what was going on. "Did you think that my request meant you were in charge here?"</p><p>They were in a stalemate; neither of them wanted to budge and tip the scales one way or another. Agatha wanted to brandish a little bit of control in a situation that could have stripped her of it all, even if that was never an actual risk in the confines of their relationship. Still, this was a bit of a power struggle they had never really embraced before and it was making Agatha feel so very <i>alive.</i></p><p>To prove her point, Agatha crossed her arms over her middle and shifted to one foot, her chin tilting forward as she looked directly at Rio from beneath raised brows.</p><p>"Well, are you just going to sit there?" she managed to complete this time without Rio close enough to grab her hair and shut her up.</p><p>The longer this was drawing on, the more Agatha pushed? She could see that appetite building in Rio just by the look on her face. She could see as it turned from hunger to starvation, welling deeper within her. She was getting something out of the build up, just like Agatha was.</p><p>Hell, the moment Rio had grabbed her like that in the spare room? It was a side of Rio that did not make an appearance very often and as a result, Agatha was desperate for more.</p><p>Rio sat, leaned back on her hands, and she simply licked her lips. It was another silent dare, but Agatha wasn't going to meet it. Instead, her arms loosened and dropped and she offered another shrug.</p><p>"Guess I'll just go finish the room, then!" she forced in a faux chirp. The moment she went to turn, though, Rio was finally pushed into action.</p><p>"Okay, okay!" Rio pressed, shoving herself up as she nearly tripped on her own feet to make it to where Agatha was, reaching down to take hold of her wrist. She pulled Agatha close by way of such contact and brought her other hand up, palming the side of Agatha's neck. Agatha's lips curled deviously just before Rio closed the space between them with a heated but not overbearing kiss. The moment her tongue curled beneath Agatha's top lip, though, she stepped back and broke the contact which left Agatha's jaw hinged enough to show her disbelief.</p><p>Rio's eyes shimmered for just a second before she severed all physical contact and held Agatha's gaze a moment longer before she stepped to the side and made her way over to disappear into the closet, leaving a wildly smirking Agatha in the bedroom alone.</p><p>Agatha finally got what she wanted, and she knew what was going to happen the moment Rio walked out of that closet. She had been nervous that Rio might try to resist, that she might take the demand as insane -- which it absolutely was -- but the times for nights like these were going to start becoming fewer and farther in between if they really were going to get what they wanted out of their lives.</p><p>In her victory, Agatha knew she still had a concession to make, too. She did as she had promised and started by peeling her shirt off of her torso so that she could discard it toward the laundry basket that sat in the corner of the bedroom. Her leggings and underwear were next and the last piece to be placed atop the pile was her bra, leaving her stark naked from head to toe.</p><p>As she faced the foot of the bed, she had debated placing herself atop it, but she heard the door creak slightly behind her and turned fully to see the source of the sound.</p><p>Agatha had known since the moment she'd gotten to see it for the first time that Rio harnessed up was one of the hottest things she had ever laid eyes on. However, as Rio stood there with a slightly larger appendage hanging between her legs than what was normally used, that was not what Agatha was suddenly fixed on, or what was making her feel like a wild animal.</p><p>Rio was also completely naked other than the equipment she was sporting except for <i>one other item. </i>There, on top of her head and turned backwards was a baseball cap. It was not just any baseball cap. It was one of Agatha's, judging by the little 'H' above the space ahead of the closure.</p><p>Instantly, Agatha's jaw dropped and her eyes filled with a burning white heat that was ripping through every single inch of her body.</p><p>Holy fuck.</p><p>
<i>That was a sight.</i>
</p><p>She felt stunned, frozen in place as she just continued to guzzle in the sight like she'd been suffering through such a deprivation her entire life. Subconsciously this time, her tongue snaked past her lips to wet them, but before she could take much longer in her appraisal, Rio was moving, lustful in her own right.</p><p>Rio met her there at the foot of the bed, those rough but tender palms of her lover reaching up to slide along the corners of her jaw. As Rio took another step in and their mouths met, Agatha could feel very acutely every inch of her belly where the silicone pressed between them, pinned there for the moment being.</p><p>Rio's kiss was hot and strong, all tongues and teeth as her her hands dislodged from Agatha's jaw and began to wander. Agatha's own hands had found station on Rio's hips, fingers tucked into the waist of the straps that hung there.</p><p>That touch of Rio's slid down the sides of Agatha's neck and over the flat scape of her chest down to the curves of her breasts. She could feel the pooling of lust in her stomach as their tongues clashed and battled. At the same time, one of Rio's hands gripped one breast while the other toyed with her stiff nipple, rubbing and pinching, pulling and tugging.</p><p>The noises she began to produce slowly instead started to happen with more frequency, but Agatha was still clutching the reigns here. The more Rio toyed with her breasts, though, the more she was feeling like she needed to offer a reminder.</p><p>In a way that stated she almost didn't want to, Agatha broke apart their kiss and concurrently used her hold on Rio's hips to shift them so that the backs of Rio's legs hit the mattress. She did not sit, though, and that was just fine with Agatha.</p><p>One of Agatha's hands unhooked from the leather and reached up to brush Rio's hair over her shoulder, exposing the scape of that bountiful neck before it rehomed on her side. It took no contemplation before Agatha's head dipped and her lips latched to warm skin, kissing and sucking softly as the grip of her other hand attempted to bring Rio closer, though it was a physical impossibility.</p><p>The kisses were stationary for only a brief moment before they began to travel, starting on a trail that wound toward the front and then traversed down Rio's throat, over the divot between her collarbones. As she kissed lower and shifted to her left, the touch on Rio's side lifted and found her right breast instead, palming and kneading as her mouth latched to the nipple on the other side.</p><p>Intently, the tip of Agatha's tongue flicked over the erect flesh in her mouth and it was the reason Rio's hand instantly flew to the back of her head. Agatha shifted slightly, making the angle a little easier to accommodate despite the fact that it loosened the fixture of that silicone between them, leaving it slack, though it had not completely dropped due to a lack of space to do so. The tip was still pressed to Agatha's skin, just beneath her navel.</p><p><i>"Fuck, Agatha,"</i> Rio groaned, her fingertips flexing with restrained pressure into the back of Agatha's scalp. It was encouraging in the worst way.</p><p>The yelp Rio exhaled the moment Agatha's teeth sunk down into her nipple cause another flaring of heat to rage through Agatha's being and she was growing antsy at her own pace. She withdrew the contact, though she made a show of the way she released Rio's breast from her mouth in the way she sucked hard until the contact was broken, a loud <i>POP!</i> sounding in the still air around them.</p><p>Before Rio could offer any protest, Agatha's lips were back on her skin, kissing toward her sternum. Rio's fingers flexed again, tangling in the hair there. The lower Agatha's kisses traveled, the more space she needed to create, losing the contact that had previously been established. As she sank down Rio's abdomen even further, high time had come for Agatha to commit, to send it full-stop.</p><p>From where she was, lips pulling off of Rio's middle just above her navel, Agatha's wanting blue gaze shifted up to Rio from beneath her lashes as she made her choice. Both of her hands planted themselves on Rio's hips so that she had something to stabilize herself as she dropped to one knee, at first, and then the other. Her eyes had hardly left Rio's face, which as Rio watched her like a hawk, had begun to shift into something darker and deeper.</p><p>Absolute need had written itself over every inch of Rio's expression and that alone made Agatha feel like she was on the verge of busting entirely.</p><p>She snapped herself back into the moment, her eyes dropping to Rio's midsection before her. She was quick in her task of resuming her kisses as she pressed her lips back to Rio's stomach, though this time below her navel instead. She shifted just enough so that she could place one more kiss just above the waist of the harness before she pulled back to survey the absolute feast in front of her.</p><p>One of the hands on Rio's hip began to shift, to slide down the side of her thigh before it wound over the front as it headed back up. Her touch graced the leather and then lifted, taking hold of Rio's member. For only a moment, Agatha let herself get hung up on the details. It was a little longer than the one Rio had always sported when they'd been at the townhome, and even a little girthier than the one Rio typically favored when they were there in the condo, but Agatha more than understood the intent.</p><p>She had been explicit in her demand. Rio knew that achieving it was impractical, but supplying the effort was something she was eager to do, and Agatha appreciated the drive.</p><p>As her eyes fixed before her, she welled up a small pool of saliva in her mouth and adjusted her position so that the moment she let the spit drop out of her mouth onto the silicone, Rio's reaction was clearly visible.</p><p>And it was glorious.</p><p>Rio's hand fought to not apply any pressure, but Agatha could feel through the touch that she was growing desperate. She didn't make Rio wait but a moment longer.</p><p>Agatha's lips parted and she pressed forward, taking first the tip into her mouth, then a little more. She was aware that Rio could not actually <i>feel</i> what she was doing, but the visuals she knew she was providing? Agatha had been where Rio currently stood <i>many, many</i> times. She knew what that did to a woman, to bear witness to such a sight, and she sure as fuck hoped that was what she was doing to Rio.</p><p>As she found a steady pace, her warm mouth devouring every inch of Rio that she could, Rio's hand had moved only to press Agatha's hair from her face before wrapping and locking in it at the back of her head once more. It was clear Rio wanted a full, unhindered view of what was actively unfolding. She almost looked like she was on the verge of going into shock, but Agatha had too much faith to let herself believe Rio would not actively fight to keep herself present for this.</p><p>The hand that was not assisting her was still on Rio's hip, but her grip had intensified greatly in a subconscious way that was only sparked by her interest in giving her wife head. What she did not realize was that she was in the active process of bruising the hell out of Rio's hip and ass.</p><p>She carried on, quickly learning that when she made noise? When she let loose of those little whimpers or whines? At first it hadn't seemed to do much, but the more it went on, the effects seemed to present themselves. The moment Agatha decided to actually moan through a mouthful of Rio, Rio lost her reserves.</p><p>The hand that was on the back of Agatha's head pressed down, causing more of her length to fill Agatha's mouth, closer to her throat. In a move that shocked even Agatha, she actually gagged. Rio released the pressure immediately, but every other muscle in her body screamed that the sound had nearly folded her before they'd even truly begun. Realizing this, Agatha slowly pulled her head back and released the hold her mouth had on Rio's member.</p><p>As she sat on her heels and let her famished gaze travel up her wife's body, the expression she was met with when she looked to Rio's face was new, but it was so impossibly hot. Rio looked primal. She looked like she could have completely come apart at the seams, but there was a touch of self-restraint laced there as though she were in an active battle that involved how to best handle this.</p><p>Agatha's lips were parted and her eyes were absolutely saturated with her appetite, but Rio was far quicker to move than Agatha had been anticipating. The hand that had been in Agatha's hair relinquished its hold and came around quickly to hook beneath her chin. Boldly, Rio's thumb did not hesitate even the slightest bit as it slipped into Agatha's mouth, curling inside of her cheek.</p><p>One could have colored Agatha surprised and truly delighted by the move; Her response was immediate as her lips closed around the digit and sucked softly, her head bobbing just slightly with the effort. It was very, very clear to her that the more she indulged in this, the closer she was to drawing out the Rio she was desperately craving.</p><p>That carried on for only a minute or so, with Agatha hungrily sucking on Rio's thumb, before Rio had finally reached the point of no return. Her thumb moved, hooking behind Agatha's bottom row of teeth just before she gave a light jerk forward.</p><p><i>"I want you off your knees,"</i> Rio commanded lowly through the breathlessness that had seemingly taken over her.</p><p>Agatha's smirk appeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p><i>"Say it like you mean it, big boy,"</i> Agatha coaxed in a sultry murmur. She had actually been anticipating the fact that Rio would ask again, so much so that she was genuinely shocked as she felt Rio reach around to grab her by the hair again, forcing her head back as Rio leaned over her, their faces only inches apart.</p><p><i>"I said get <b>up,</b>"</i> Rio ordered again, but this time, her actions amplified her message as she lifted the handful of hair she had in her grasp, forcing Agatha into movement. She managed to get to her feet, though Rio never released her hold, even when they were eye to eye. <i>"Is this what you want?"</i></p><p>Agatha lit up like a brush fire in the middle of summer that began with a carelessly flicked cigarette. She was on fucking fire from head to toe. It was Rio's way of still asking: <i>What do you want, Agatha? </i></p><p><i>"Getting closer,"</i> Agatha rasped back, her hand reaching down between them as her fingers wrapped around Rio's length, pulling on it in need. She started to close the space between them, but Rio's arm flexed in her effort to keep Agatha where she was, and Agatha had seen the bulge of muscle out of the corner of her eye enough that it made her weak toward her middle.</p><p><i>"Rio Vidal,"</i> Agatha managed in something slightly sharper than a hiss. <i>"Put a goddamn baby in me or let me get back to work."</i></p><p>Agatha had predicted that such a statement would garner her at least a smashing of teeth, but Rio still found ways to surprise her. She was more than surprised, then, when Rio leaned closer, like they were going to kiss, but then gave a firm yank on Agatha's hair in a move that garnered her full access to the length of that gorgeous neck.</p><p>The moment Rio's teeth sank into the skin and muscle there, their weight shifted with the way Rio stepped into Agatha and turned her around so that she was the one stood between the bed and the storm that was Rio, the one Agatha had begged be brought on herself.</p><p>The bite on Agatha's skin released at the same time the hold in her hair did. That hand, the one Agatha felt like she needed around her throat, found itself pressed to the center of her sternum.</p><p>That moment was a surreal one. It was both a precursor to what was to come as Agatha knew Rio was about to use it to shove her to the bed, but it was also... something else. There was a pause in Rio's motions the moment her palm touched Agatha's skin. That lightning in her eyes did not stop sparking and her expression did not soften, but Agatha quickly realized what she was doing.</p><p>Rio was deliberately checking in, even wordlessly, by placing her hand to Agatha's heart.</p><p>This was new for them in that Agatha had always wondered what it would be like to have a place to show all sides of herself, all sides of who she wanted to be and who she could be. She had wanted, as all humans do, to have a safe place to finally let go of every layer she had tried to bury her true self under. She knew she had found it in Rio, and it was moments like that one that were a very vivid and constant reminder.</p><p>All Agatha did in response was nod.</p><p>She knew Rio was about to give her exactly what she wanted, so the goading felt unnecessary. Rio needed the encouragement, the acknowledgement that while miles away from anything they'd indulged in so blatantly before both in manner and in context, it was still okay. In fact, it was more than okay.</p><p>The tenderness of the moment was gone as quickly as it had come and Rio did exactly as Agatha had predicted she would, pushing her with that contact on Agatha's chest so that she fell back onto the bed, bouncing slightly as she settled into place. Immediately, Rio stepped forward, her hands on the insides of Agatha's knees. She pushed them apart first and then let her touch trek around the outside of them to hook beneath her thighs, giving a rough jerk to pull Agatha closer toward the edge of the bed.</p><p>As Agatha looked up at Rio's face, Rio was not looking at her. She was looking at Agatha's body, she was making the calculations in her head. She was surveying every inch of the form she had every intention of wrecking over the next however-long Agatha could stand it. And then, her eyes lifted.</p><p>Looking into those dark eyes, Agatha could see every single crackle of electricity that flashed there. Even as Rio stepped forward to lean over the length of Agatha's torso, it didn't dim or fade. Instead, it only seemed to get brighter at the way her stance had allowed for the dildo to press into the inside of Agatha's thigh, close to that peak between her legs.</p><p>As Rio ducked down to devour Agatha in a kiss that was teeming with desire, her hand also found its familiar retreat between Agatha's legs.</p><p>Agatha could feel, in such an aware state of bliss, as Rio's fingers found her core, swimming in the utter wetness that had developed there since this had begun. She could feel the amusement that filled her wife at such a realization in the way it was the slightest breathed chuckle into their kiss.</p><p>Agatha's only response was to lift her hips, a demand for more.</p><p>Rio had gotten what she'd needed out of that interaction, anyway, and removed the touch. Immediately, a scowl formed across Agatha's features but Rio only met it with a shit-eating grin.</p><p>Finally, Rio leaned slightly at the waist and slid her hands beneath Agatha's thighs, pushing up on them so that her calves came to rest on Rio's shoulders.</p><p>As Agatha watched her, she suddenly felt like she'd tried to swallow sandpaper. Looking at Rio, stood there with her fucking backwards hat on a head that was stationed between Agatha's legs, it was almost enough to push her over the edge before Rio even made the decision to finally start fucking her.</p><p>Rio's head dropped as she focused on the task at hand. One of her hands had wrapped around the front of Agatha's thigh as she used the other to position herself correctly. Agatha felt it immediately, but it was just a slight pressure. Rio had not actually braved forward but instead was making sure that she was exactly where she needed to be, an answer she got in the form of Agatha arching her back in encouragement.</p><p>As those blue eyes studied the woman before her, Agatha's teeth sank into her bottom lip. The very second that Rio looked up at her with that insane smirk and concurrently pressed her hips forward -- firm, but nowhere near rough -- as her length entered Agatha's core, Agatha was certain she was going to do little more than burn from the fire consuming her.</p><p>Rio was careful, initially, because this was also a bit of an experiment in what different things might work for them in this dynamic. She was in tune with Agatha's every move, every breath, knowing exactly the right way to read her in the event that something wasn't quite right.</p><p>Agatha noticed immediately that the stretch was more intense than she was accustomed to from the couple of times she'd given into the need before, and it caused a breathless cry to escape her lips. Her fingers tangled in the duvet beneath her and while her eyes had closed upon contact, she forced them back open to take in the sight of Rio.</p><p>Rio, who had arranged herself in a way that she could both have a clear view of the pleasure on Agatha's face as well as take in the sight of her own work as her hips began to find a rhythm against Agatha's.</p><p>Rio who had been holding her lip between her teeth since she'd slid inside of Agatha.</p><p>Rio who looked so fucking hot in every bit of her goddamn dykey glory as she rolled her hips fluidly in her effort.</p><p>As Rio picked up her pace, one of Agatha's hands had launched off the bed to secure it over Rio's where it was placed on her thigh. She gripped at Rio's fingers hard, even harder the first time she felt Rio's hips make full contact with the surface of her ass due to their positioning. That had elicited an incredibly loud and incredibly deep cry that echoed off of every wall in the room.</p><p>That was a sound Rio apparently liked and wanted more of.</p><p>The frenzy began to seep into her movements and Agatha could feel it, could sense it. The more time ticked on, the more bravery Rio seemed to acquire. She was in full compliance of Agatha's request as her hips began to nearly slam with each thrust, drawing louder and louder cries right from the depths of Agatha's lungs.</p><p>Agatha was in complete surrender, gripping at Rio's hand so hard that her own knuckles were white from the effort.</p><p><i>"D-Dont st-stop,"</i> Agatha nearly begged, earning another meeting of their bodies in a way that she was almost certain actually touched her stomach. Another cry launched itself into the night, but it was only one in a series.</p><p>Agatha had to give it to Rio, she really was trying.</p><p>And it was working exactly how Agatha had intended.</p><p>Judging by the consistent wails and moans and screams Rio was managing to produce as a result of her effort, Rio knew it too. If she hadn't been aware, she certainly was the moment she slammed their hips together and Agatha's calves on Rio's shoulders sank down with force in time with the way the rest of her body seemed to tense.</p><p>Agatha felt it every single place in her all at one time as the shock tore through her and she felt like, once again, she'd been set alight as the ripples of her orgasm jolted through her. One last long cry reverberated into the night as it happened.</p><p>Rio's head turned and she placed her lips to the inside of Agatha's calf, kissing it softly. With gentle hands, Agatha felt as Rio reached up to maneuver her legs back down so they could hang over the edge of the bed. In the same motion, Rio stepped back and Agatha was almost disappointed at the slight emptiness that took her place.</p><p>That disappointment was gone the moment she realized that they were nowhere near done.</p><p>Rio was quick in her usual tenderness, though, to present affection after an arduous exertion of effort. She leaned over Agatha on that bed and met her with a soft kiss, sweet in its delivery. It was another check-in, another attempt for Rio to gauge how this was progressing.</p><p>Agatha couldn't have been more thrilled, or satisfied.</p><p>In fact, she was already gearing up for round two.</p><p><i>"That was a pretty good first attempt,"</i> Agatha murmured against Rio's lips, her tone low and husky but woven with a hint of her amusement.</p><p><i>"Yeah, sure sounded like it,"</i> Rio offered back, her words rich with her pride.</p><p>
<i>"But... That's not all you've got, right big guy?"</i>
</p><p>There above her, Rio's eyes flashed again. Agatha truly had found the most twisted sense of gratification every single time that Rio seemed to lose her mind when Agatha chose more masculine descriptors. It seemed to have the same effect as dumping kerosene onto a fire, and Agatha ate up every single moment of it.</p><p>The moment Agatha felt Rio bite at her lip, she released a squeal that shifted into a whine the moment Rio released it and stood back to full height. That hot gaze full of desire dropped again and Rio offered a pointed chin in instruction before she verbalized it.</p><p><i>"Up. And turn over." </i>Her demand was quiet, but it was firm and Agatha knew to oblige immediately.</p><p>She scooted up slightly before turning over onto her stomach, face only an inch away from the pillows, a feral grin curling her lips.</p><p><i>"Hand me a pillow,"</i> Rio requested and Agatha listened, grabbing one to swing it back in Rio's general direction.</p><p>Agatha could feel as Rio slid onto the bed, knees on either side of Agatha's legs as she found where she wanted to rest for the moment. Once Rio settled over the backs of Agatha's thighs, her hand hooked into the haunch of Agatha's hip and gave a tug that indicated she wanted them lifted.</p><p>Again, Agatha offered little resistance and was actually delighted by the way Rio wedged the pillow beneath her hips, offering a comfortable angle that they could both enjoy. Despite the consideration, something inside Agatha was still scorching and she couldn't curb her tongue any longer.</p><p><i>"Papiiii," </i>she whined and in the very next second, she heard Rio suck in the sharpest breath. If she'd been trying to keep to any sort of plan, that had immediately been hurled right out of that 3rd story window.</p><p>Agatha felt Rio's hand as it fell to the inside of her thigh, pushing it enough that she could move forward, pressing her length right back into Agatha's tight sex. Yet again, another pleasured cry sounded off into the night and they were right back in it.</p><p>The way Rio didn't hesitate the time, the way her hips moved with fluidity and purpose, it was driving Agatha up a goddamn wall. It was everything she had been aching for. However, when Rio had reached down and fastened her hand to the back of Agatha's neck in a tight grip? Agatha came instantaneously, those beautiful sounds filling the air around them.</p><p><i>"Keep going!"</i> she managed through gasps as she fought to press her hips back.</p><p>Just as Rio began to pick up pace again, something unthinkable happened.</p><p>The fucking doorbell rang.</p><p><i>"What the fuck? It's almost fucking midnight,"</i> Rio hissed angrily, though she didn't stop her frantic movements.</p><p>Then it rang again.</p><p><i>"Noooo!" </i>Agatha whined, feeling distraught as Rio cursed again and slid out of her, leaving her to experience that emptiness again.</p><p><i>"I have to, Agatha, something's clearly wrong,"</i> Rio managed, though Agatha could clearly hear how pissed off she was about it.</p><p>Begrudgingly, Agatha rolled to her back as she caught sight of Rio, who had her back to Agatha, as she pulled on a pair of grey sweatpants and threw a t-shirt over her head. By the time she was crossing into the hallway, the doorbell was ringing a third time.</p><p>Annoyed and frustrated at the circumstances, Agatha blew out a huff of air before reaching up to run a hand over her hot and slightly sweaty face. Went to fucking figure, didn't it? Who the fuck would even be ringing Rio's doorbell in the first place, let alone at that time of night?</p><p>When Rio had not returned after a couple of minutes, Agatha's curiosity won out. She pulled herself out of bed and plucked her silk robe off of the closet door handle. Once it was on, she tied it at the waist and ventured down the stairs, more than a little shocked to see Rio standing in the open doorway as she talked with two police officers.</p><p>"Good evening, officers," Agatha greeted as she wobbily reached the bottom of the stairs. "Is everything alright?"</p><p>Rio's head snapped over her shoulder, pinning Agatha with a gaze that said she was probably in trouble once this interaction was over.</p><p>"We just got a call from a concerned citizen," voiced the officer on the left, a shorter man with red hair and a chinstrap of a beard along his jaw. The other man beside him was taller, thinner, and kept his face clean, probably to show off his incredible bone structure.</p><p>"We just wanted to do a check to ensure that everyone was safe. It is just the two of you here?" the thinner one asked and Rio gave a nod.</p><p>"Yes, it's just us," Agatha answered sweetly from a few paces behind Rio. "We're just trying for a baby. Sorry if we caused any problems."</p><p>At such a statement, several things happened concurrently.</p><p>Rio's head nearly dropped into her neck and Agatha could see the red across the back of it.</p><p>The ginger officer's eyes were so wide he looked like he might actually pass out.</p><p>The other officer's eyes dropped to Rio's crotch and immediately, his lips tucked down at the corners as brows raised and his head tipped to the side in an entire gesture that shouted 'I get it.'</p><p>Agatha finally closed the space that was left as she slid up behind Rio, placing a palm on her back as she appeared over her shoulder, fighting every bit of herself for the diabolical smirk that wanted to curl her lips.</p><p>"We'll be more mindful, officers, you have our word."</p><p>"We'll hold you to that, ma'am. Both of you have a good night."</p><p>The moment they turned to head down the steps, Rio nearly slammed the door shut so hard that the glass was on the verge of shattering.</p><p>"Agatha! I fucking know one of them!" Rio screeched as she turned around.</p><p>"It's the gay one, ri--" Agatha had started, but her eyes dropped to where the officer's had and she understood what he had understood. <i>"Oh."</i></p><p>Agatha had heard it many a time. Straight women went absolutely mental over the idea of 'grey sweatpants season.' The concept behind it made sense from that perspective, but Agatha never really quite got it.</p><p>Right then, looking down at the bulge that was quite obvious as a result of Rio's rush to put on clothes to answer the door?</p><p>Agatha fucking <i>got it.</i></p><p>It took her no time to move forward on the attack, hands raising to grab Rio by the jaw, forcing their lips together in a suddenly desperate kiss that Agatha knew would not cut it. She stepped into Rio, pressing her back to the front door as one of her hands dropped. The moment it left Rio's jaw, it fell directly to that protrusion at the front of her pants.</p><p>It was Agatha, this time, who pressed her tongue hungrily past Rio's lips. It was Agatha, this time, who was bringing the heat and the aggression as she literally groped her wife not moments after being questioned by the police for the amount of noise they -- or, more accurately, Agatha -- had been making.</p><p>It was Agatha who knew exactly what she wanted.</p><p>She let herself carry on like that for a few long moments, and Rio seemed to be rather enjoying it by the sounds <i>she</i> had started to make, but Agatha needed more.</p><p>She pried her lips away and through a breathless pant, she made her request.</p><p>
<i>"I want you to sit on the couch. If I don't grind on you in the next thirty seconds, I might actually fucking explode."</i>
</p><p>Her eyes opened to take in Rio's expression who instantly looked both thrilled and terrified. It took her only a moment before that classic Rio smirk made an appearance.</p><p>
<i>"You just have an innate desire to ruin any pair of pants I own, don't you?" </i>
</p><p>Agatha's gaze narrowed and her lips pursed slightly.</p><p>
<i>"We are down to about twenty seconds. Are you going to bitch or are you going to move your ass?"</i>
</p><p>The giddiness that took over Rio consumed her in a visible way as she grabbed Agatha by the hand and led her over to the couch. The moment Rio was seated in a way that seemed comfortable enough, Agatha was quick to place herself on Rio's lap, hands finding temporary homes on her shoulders for the few moments it took her to get comfortable. She shifted her hips around slightly, settling in <i>exactly</i> the right spot.</p><p>Agatha kept herself mostly still, only moving to slide a hand up the side of Rio's neck, her thumb moving to push gently at Rio's jaw to beguile her to look up instead of where her gaze was currently fixated on the way Agatha's robe opened up to reveal the contact of her soft flesh with the fabric of Rio's sweatpants.</p><p>As their eyes met, Rio was practically drooling.</p><p><i>"You like that, handsome?"</i> Agatha crooned smoothly just before she leaned down to press their lips together in a sultry kiss.</p><p>Rio answered in the return of the lip lock, but also by placing each hand on one of Agatha's respective ass cheeks, gripping and pulling in a way that encouraged movement.</p><p>Agatha heard the call and she responded.</p><p>The kiss devolved into a mess the moment Agatha forced her focus to the way she had started to roll her hips, working them against the mound that had formed as a result of Rio's attempted concealment. The friction was there almost immediately and it caused her to exhale a low wine into Rio's mouth. The way Rio sank her fingertips into the flesh of Agatha's ass was a reminder to keep things like that to a lower volume, which was only half noted in Agatha's current state.</p><p>Once she had let her body understand the mechanics, Agatha found the best rhythm and it seemed to be working for the both of them. She knew that Rio had been humoring her in the build up to all of this, but right then? Right then, as Agatha's hips rolled down into Rio's and she felt as their lips tore apart so she could make hungry work of Agatha's chest, Agatha knew that it meant just as much to Rio as it did to her.</p><p>One of her hands had found station on the back of Rio's head as she licked and sucked at one of Agatha's breasts and the other had landed on the back of the couch, providing her a little more leverage in her fervent quest for release.</p><p>Agatha had rocked forward an the same time Rio's teeth sank roughly into the inside flesh of her right breast and it was exactly what she had needed to sail right over that edge. Fingertips nearly pressed indents into the frame of the couch as she felt herself coming, but as her lips parted and she began to moan, Rio's hand snapped up and fastened itself over her mouth, stifling the sound as it came out.</p><p>Agatha's eyes rolled back into her head at the action and the moan fizzled out into a couple of quiet whimpers as she began to come back down from the momentary high she had been provided.</p><p>Instantly, she folded into Rio, panting from the exertion. If she had her way, they still weren't done, but for the time being needed to catch her breath.</p><p><i>"You..."</i> Rio forced out, turning her head so that she could brush her lips against whatever part of Agatha's face she could get to, <i>"...are an absolute animal."</i></p><p><i>"Yeah, okay, Daddy Rio," </i>Agatha shot back, pressing her fingertips into the lean muscle of Rio's trapezius from where her touch had been resting on Rio's shoulder.</p><p>
<i>"In ten minutes, you're gonna regret that."</i>
</p><p><i>"Ooh, is that a threat?"</i> Agatha challenged in a giggle.</p><p>
<i>"No, my wife, that's an absolute promise."</i>

<p>By 3:30am, when Rio had collapsed onto her back with about two percent left on her personal battery charge, she had not managed Agatha's request -- for quite obvious reasons -- but the effort she had put forth was more than Agatha had even dreamed was possible. It became even better when Rio managed to speak a few minutes later, though her chest was still heaving.</p><p>"I... Cannot... Move..." she pushed between breaths and it caused the most delighted giggle to sound from Agatha's throat, though she was not exactly doing much better. There was a soft <i>thud</i> as the harness Rio had shed before her collapse hit the floor as it slipped from her fingertips on a hand that hung over the edge of the bed.</p><p>Despite her limbs feeling like dead weights, Agatha picked herself up enough to roll over, her own sweat stricken skin pressing to Rio's as she folded over her side, into the crook of her arm. Somehow, with her best efforts, Agatha managed to hold her head up so that she could simply take a moment to gaze at her wife, the woman she loved, the woman she was actively trying to start a family with, even if it could not be a biological one.</p><p>Rio's eyes fought to open, looking like they were held down by anvils, and the moment they landed on Agatha's mystified expression, a lazy smile pulled at Rio's lips.</p><p><i>"What?"</i> came her worn whisper. There was this softness in those dark honey pools, one that filled Agatha with a different kind of warmth, a homier version of tenderness, if she had to put a name to it.</p><p><i>"You just amaze me, that's all,"</i> Agatha offered back, though it was almost a dismissal, and Rio accepted it as such.</p><p><i>"Come here," </i>Rio requested of her, though she made no move to assist in the action, proving just how truly spent she was.</p><p>The moment Agatha scooted up enough that she could easily reach Rio to give her a soft and sweet kiss, an idea struck her. A good idea.</p><p>She pulled away and looked down at Rio, her self-satisfied grin instant as it lit up her face.</p><p>
<i>"I'll be right back. Stay put."</i>
</p><p>At this, Rio exhaled a dry and rocky laugh.</p><p>
<i>"I don't think I could go anywhere if I tried." </i>
</p><p>Another stolen peck and another laugh sounded, though this time it came from Agatha, pitch high but low in volume. Immediately after, Agatha somehow found the ability to drag herself from the comforts of the bed, though she was aware of almost every spot in her body that was bound to be sore for the coming days.</p><p>With considerable effort, light footsteps carried her toward the bathroom already knowing what her plan was and how she would execute it, given that Rio had at least some of the things she would need to do so.</p><p>Pacing across the cool tile, Agatha made her way straight to the spout of the claw-foot tub that sat in the back corner of Rio's bathroom, adjacent to the glass shower they spent too many mornings in. The tub was gorgeous and Agatha had fought herself too many times on asking Rio what the fuck need she had for it, but as she was realizing, it could absolutely prove useful.</p><p>The water poured freely the moment Agatha turned the faucet on, the force doubling by the time she'd turned the hot water on, too. She placed a hand beneath it to gauge the temperature as it leveled out and once satisfied, returned to the rest of her task.</p><p>Across the room, she pulled open the closet door and did a quick scan in an attempt to locate a few of the things she could use in her attempt to soothe her depleted wife. After a second sweep, she located two: a bottle of lavender bath oil and a small glass box that held pink flower petals inside. Rio was such a romantic.</p><p>Agatha removed the desired items and turned back, heading straight to the tub. With a precisely measured squeeze, a small stream of the scented oil dropped down into the water and Agatha plunged a couple of fingers into the depth to distribute it a bit better. Once content, she pulled the lid off of the jar and extracted several petals, lightly sprinkling them along the surface of the bath.</p><p>She watched for a moment as the water level rose to a satisfactory height before bending just enough at the waist so that she could close the faucet, staunching the flow entirely. The smell of lavender had already filled the air and she felt as though there was only one more thing she needed in order to accomplish what she was trying to do.</p><p>Still stark naked and covered in red marks, hickeys, and bite marks, Agatha nearly floated out of the bathroom and made a turn for the doorway that emptied into the hallway, but Rio saw her and offered an inquiry.</p><p>"Where are you going?" Rio questioned, finally able to at least lift her head off of the pillow it had been resting on.</p><p>"Nowhere outside of the house looking like this," Agatha shot back over her shoulder, her tone teasing but honest.</p><p>With that, she disappeared through the doorway and ventured downstairs, heading straight for the pantry. In the recess, there was a little cove that was tucked away, cooler. It held the few bottles of wine -- vintage, from the looks of the labels -- Rio owned. Agatha was aware that they were likely for special occasions, but not a one of them had been touched since they'd gotten married.</p><p>What better time than right then?</p><p>Agatha dropped to a squat and pulled a couple out to examine the labels, finally settling on '96 Château Pontet Canet. As she rose back to full height, she spun on her heel and headed for the kitchen, easily locating a corkscrew to open the wine. She felt a bit more comfortable and familiar with the condo, now that it was becoming theirs instead of just Rio's, and it showed in her ability to locate things and know where everything belonged.</p><p>Next, she snatched two glasses from the cabinet above the sink. Armed in both hands with the last pieces to the puzzle of pampering her wife, Agatha set forth on her path back upstairs. She was careful to conceal what was in her hands as she slipped back into the bathroom to drop them off on the countertop to the sink. After only a moment, she was emerging back into the bedroom, appearing on Rio's side of the bed.</p><p><i>"C'mere, big guy," </i>Agatha murmured at her, leaning down to both steal a kiss and slide an arm beneath Rio's knees as well as her shoulders.</p><p><i>"Agatha, what are you doing?" </i>came Rio's uncertain question, ringing clear with her absolute exhaustion.</p><p><i>"I'm taking care of my thoroughly exhausted wife after she just spent hours on end giving me almost everything I asked for. Now, show some initiative would you?" </i>Agatha offered back sarcastically, pulling the support below Rio's knees back so that she could pick up Rio's far arm and half-heartedly toss it around her neck, her way of communicating that the assistance would be helpful.</p><p>Rio caught on and wrapped her hold there snugly so that when Agatha lifted her up, she was able to cling a little better.</p><p><i>"And what exactly does that all entail?" </i>Rio asked barely above a soft hum.</p><p>
<i>"Right now it entails me, you, and that big ol' bathtub. And some wine I stole from your little hidey hole." </i>
</p><p>Agatha's feet hit the cool tile again, but she made the same beeline straight for the tub. Once there, she was careful in her delivery as she lowered Rio into the water, unable to stop the grin that found her at the low hum of comfort and warmth that sounded from deep in Rio's throat. As Agatha righted herself and dropped down to behold the love of her life, the comfort she found in that expression settled something in her she had not known was loose.</p><p>It was the feeling of finally knowing true peace.</p><p>She stood there basking in it for a beat too long and Rio opened her eyes, her confusion evident as she looked up at Agatha.</p><p>"What are you doing, my love?" Rio voiced, still soft though she had garnered a little resolve.</p><p>"Just... appreciating you," Agatha answered, that warm smile curling her lips again. She glanced over toward the sink and then back at Rio, tilting her head toward the bottle of wine and glasses she had procured.</p><p>Rio's line of sight followed and a mixture of surprise and admonishment crossed her features before she looked back up to meet those blue eyes.</p><p>"That's for a special occasion," Rio chastised as Agatha knew she would.</p><p>"Well, we have not opened a single one of those bottles since we've gotten married so... Even if <i>you</i> would not qualify tonight as a special occasion, we can at least post-date it and claim it's for our nuptials," Agatha suggested as she turned to tend to the duty of pouring them each a glass. Once she was done, she moved over to the little glass stand that held a few random items and relocated those to the counter before she pulled it over to the side of the bathtub so they had somewhere to set their glasses.</p><p>She fetched and returned with the glasses, handing one over to Rio before she gave a light tap on Rio's shoulder.</p><p>"Scoot up, hot stuff," Agatha encouraged and Rio took no time to oblige. The moment she was up far enough, Agatha was cautious in her movements as she stepped into the tub and then maneuvered enough to fit herself behind Rio, her hips cradling Rio's backside.</p><p>All of that movement and effort and yet, not a drop of wine was spilled.</p><p>"Thank you for this," Rio offered the moment Agatha placed her chin on Rio's shoulder and released a content sigh.</p><p>"You don't have to thank me, you deserved it. Dare I say, you even earned it," she teased, turning her head so that she could press her lips to Rio's cheek.</p><p>"So..." Rio mused, "does all of this mean you're going to let me sleep in?"</p><p>"Rio, my darling, we're drinking wine at four in the morning. We're both sleeping in. We can tackle Stevie's room in the afternoon." It was an answer that came with ease, one that was justifiable in both practicality and means. Neither of them would be of much use if they tried to force themselves out of bed in three or four hours. Any attempt at productivity from that standpoint would have been laughable and they both knew it.</p><p>Rio seemed to accept that as a fair answer. For a few long moments, they sat in the quiet of that bathroom, sipping at their wine as Agatha took the occasional opportunity to place a kiss to Rio's skin, whether it was her shoulder, her neck, or her cheek. It was just a chance to be a little closer, to shower Rio with even an iota of the affection she deserved.</p><p>Agatha set her glass on top of the little stand and shifted just enough that she could reach into the caddy that hung over the edge of the tub, the one that held the soaps and hair products. She squeezed an eye shut as she used her sense of touch to feel out the bottles enough to know what she was looking for. Convinced she found it, she pulled it up, pleased when she realized that she'd been right.</p><p>Before she opened it, she reached around Rio to gingerly pluck the wine glass from her fingers, too, so that it could be set aside for the time being. Some part of Agatha knew Rio wanted to question the process, but she was also aware that Rio knew she didn't have to, at least right then. With one more reach over the side of the tub, Agatha swiped the string of the loofah that had been hanging there, too.</p><p>The moment the rough material hit the skin of Rio's left shoulder, her head tipped back, the crown of it making gentle contact with the point of Agatha's chin in a way that caused a soft laugh to spill through the lips that parted as a result of the collision.</p><p>Agatha took her time, washing the sweat of effort that had started to dry on Rio's skin, working her way down one arm. When she reached Rio's hand, Agatha brought up both of hers to massage Rio's palm, her fingers. As she began the same process on the other side, the sound of Rio's voice actually startled her.</p><p><i>"I want to tell you something," </i>she admitted and although it was so quiet, Agatha simply had not been expecting it.</p><p><i>"Tell me, baby," </i>Agatha urged back, placing a kiss to the side of her head as she began to work the loofah over Rio's right shoulder.</p><p>
<i>"I was nervous... Nervous about what you were asking of me. About... being that person again."</i>
</p><p>This was actually not as shocking to Agatha as Rio might have assumed it was. She had noticed it, the hesitance. Calling it out would have been counterproductive and Agatha had been fully aware of that fact, which was why she had let it go at the time. She continued her work of spreading the soap across Rio's skin, but she was still listening.</p><p><i>"I... That picture was taken the summer after the accident. In those months, I... Did not choose my coping skills wisely. I drank too much, I fucked too much, I was always fighting myself to not be late to class. I made a lot of terrible decisions and I am sure I hurt a lot of people, but was just too drunk to notice or care." </i>The longer Rio spoke, her voice seemed to drop. Agatha could hear the shame there but her personal opinion was that it wasn't necessary, especially with her. She sensed that Rio was not finished and let her continue instead of offering an opposing argument.</p><p>
<i>"One morning during fall semester, I woke up in an alley as my friend's boyfriend pulled me up over his shoulder and dumped me into the back of his truck. I spent the next two days sick as a dog in bed and missed an entire day of class, which I kicked my own ass over for longer. I realized that I couldn't keep living like that. I couldn't keep dealing with my grief by getting blackout drunk and fucking anything that walked and actually move anywhere in my hopes for a career. It was... self-sabotage in its finest form."</i>
</p><p>Agatha's actions had stopped; she had discarded the loofah to float atop the water and instead had wrapped her hand around Rio's, threading her fingers through the spaces there beneath the water. Her chin tucked over Rio's shoulder again and her left arm came to wrap around Rio's middle, holding her tightly.</p><p><i>"And you didn't. You made the choice to change, to be better. I... I will apologize for putting you in that space of discomfort because it was unintentional, but... we both know that if you had truly needed, you are always aware that we could have had this conversation before and it wouldn't have changed anything," </i>Agatha tried to explain, though she realized it wasn't coming out exactly the way she wanted it to. <i>"I just mean... You don't have to do things that are sourced in trauma just because I ask. And, to be very clear, I would have never asked if I had known."</i></p><p><i>"I know, Agatha," </i>Rio supplemented the moment Agatha stopped to take a breath. <i>"And that's why I didn't want to talk about it before. I just... Needed a couple of extra minutes to understand the here and now as opposed to the then. I had to think my way to the point where I realized that I can be <b>any</b> version of myself with you and... You're not going to run away."</i></p><p>Hearing it stated so plainly, it almost hammered directly into the center of Agatha's chest. She had long since renounced her desire to run, and they were both well aware, but to hear Rio state that she had found comfort in that? It made the reward of staying somehow even sweeter, even more sentimental.</p><p><i>"You're right. I'm not. You're kind of stuck with me now," </i>Agatha murmured. She shifted slightly, reaching up at the same time to touch Rio's jaw, a silent request for her to turn her head. When she did, Agatha managed to gain enough of an angle to press their lips together. She kissed Rio like she cared irrevocably for her. She kissed Rio like she was the only woman in the world that Agatha could ever love, because she was exactly that. Their lips parted and Rio was quick to staunch any silence before it could start.</p><p>
<i>"And I couldn't be luckier."</i>
</p><p>*****</p><p>Over the course of the next couple of weeks, the two of them had managed what had once seemed impossible. They'd undergone the interview process and had come out of it rather confident, hoping that it was going to lend to the good thing they believed they had going. They had prepared the entire house and had even completed Stevie's room, though that had taken a considerable amount of time more than they had initially surmised to do so. This was only due to the fact that Rio had been sparked with inspiration that had compelled her to paint an entire Bluey mural on the far wall of the bedroom.</p><p>"I am <i>not</i> a painter!" Rio would shout sometimes. Other times, it came out in a grunt or a groan. Sometimes, it could be heard when she screeched it as Agatha was in the kitchen making a cup of tea to try and soothe her agitated artist.</p><p>By the time she finished?</p><p>Agatha was in awe of Rio's ability. She had stated, shouted, hollered, and grumbled over and over again that she wasn't a painter, but Agatha thought that to be a lie. That mural was just as good, if not better, than it would have been if they had paid someone to do it instead. Maybe it had tried Rio's patience and challenged her belief in herself, but Agatha had wasted no time in assuring her just how good it actually was, and how much it would mean to Stevie when she got to see it for the first time, the very second Rio had pulled her in to show her.</p><p>"You're not a painter and I'm not a poet," Agatha had told her, arms wrapped around Rio's middle from behind as she peered from her spot over Rio's shoulder at the hours and hours worth of work she had poured into something she loved, something that gave her passion and motivation.</p><p>"That's a hard point to argue." Rio's acknowledgement had been disgruntled, but it was fair. Rio knew Agatha's capabilities and Agatha knew Rio's. It never had to be a blatant discussion for it to be a very solid piece of the base that grounded who they were as a couple.</p><p>"Mark this down as the first day in history that Rio Vidal couldn't find a rebuttal to something I said," Agatha teased, pressing her lips to the side of Rio's head, concurrently breathing a laugh that rustled her hair.</p><p>"Oh, it won't happen again for many, many moons."</p><p>Although she wouldn't have admitted it, Agatha had been keeping track of the weeks. She'd marked down the days for the almost eight weeks since they had last seen Stevie.</p><p>That morning, as she marked the day before off, she found herself wishing she had something to mark in terms of moving forward. All she could do now was tally the ones that had passed. It didn't feel like a triumph, didn't actually feel like progress. Instead, it was just another day gone that they had waited and not gotten the call.</p><p>Agatha was feeling it a little more that day, wondering if it could be another three months before they heard anything. The first three were agonizing enough. She wanted to get lost in the thoughts about how they might be able to get through it, thoughts about how they were going to sit on their hands for another three months and just wait. With a lecture on her schedule that morning and office hours to tend to after, she simply couldn't.</p><p>Distracting herself was easy when she had a syllabus to follow and a lesson plan that she could pour every bit of her energy into. It had been even easier because she had learned her lesson: her phone remained face down and Rio knew that if something was truly wrong to call her and she would be quick in her response.</p><p>As she often did, she got easily lost in the motions of her duty to her job, and to her students. It was second nature to pace across that floor, to speak of the things she knew and the things she believed would help make them better academics. It was like breathing for her, to answer every question with confidence that was guided by knowledge. Because of that simplicity, the time rolled on too quickly.</p><p>As her students packed their things and departed the lecture hall, she turned over her phone to see six text messages from Rio.</p><p>
<i>"Hey. Call me ASAP."</i>
</p><p>
<i>"I know you're in a lecture, but call me as soon as you can."</i>
</p><p>
<i>"Nevermind, just come home if you're able when you're done."</i>
</p><p>
<i>"Actually, can you skip office hours today? I'm coming home now."</i>
</p><p>
<i>"I'm sorry, I just don't want to call because it's not really an emergency. You should just really come home."</i>
</p><p>
<i>"We need to talk."</i>
</p><p>The lower she scrolled through the messages, the deeper the creases in Agatha's forehead became as her frown settled deep in her muscles. Rio was normally articulate, but something seemed wrong in the tone of those messages, and in what they actually said. It was a jumbled mess, honestly, and none of it made much sense. Rio was waffling, going back and forth between trying make it seem important and yet not wanting to be a bother.</p><p>By the time she got to that last message, Agatha felt sick.</p><p>With great haste, Agatha gathered her things and locked up her office, knowing it wasn't the right thing to do. Something was wrong, though, and she needed to find out what. By the time she was climbing into the car, she was calling Rio. The line rang several times and then, it kicked her over to voicemail.</p><p><i>"Fuck,"</i> Agatha grunted, hanging up before she tried again.</p><p>This time, Rio picked up.</p><p>"Hey, sorry, I was changing. Are you coming home?" Her tone was so cool, so casual, as if she had not sent an incredibly confusing string of text messages that had nearly given Agatha whiplash.</p><p>"I am, what's going on?" Agatha's words were thick with her worry, nearly sticking to her tongue as she tried to force them out.</p><p>"Hey, hey," Rio soothed, "Nothing's wrong, I just... Know that it's an in person conversation and if I let you stay for office hours, you'd be really pissed at me."</p><p>Agatha was trying to play catch-up; Rio clearly knew something she did not, something that warranted a conversation and a disgustingly ominous 'we need to talk' text message. What could possibly be so important that --</p><p>"Rio," Agatha forced out, trying not to choke on the lone word as the realization hit her. She was trying to both think and drive and she was not sure it was going to be the best conversation if she could not corral herself in and find a way to split her focus. "Did... Did the social worker call you?"</p><p>"She did. Are you on your way home?" There was still that coolness, that calmness that was snug over everything Rio was saying. She was doing her best to subdue Agatha and keep her from panicking, but it was backfiring. She was being <i>too</i> calm, <i>too</i> collected.</p><p>"If nothing's wrong and Nicole called... Does that... Rio, does that mean what I think it means?"</p><p>Rio was quiet for just long enough that Agatha was actually starting to get upset. She wanted to yell, to tell Rio to just spit it out and stop playing these ridiculous games, but something else happened first.</p><p>Rio let out a shuddered breath, and then she sniffled. She was crying.</p><p>"It does. And for the love of everything, do <i>not</i> wreck the car."</p><p>It was a damn good thing Rio put that as a stipulation because in that very moment, Agatha was in an incredibly active battle to not lock up due to the stunning understanding that had suddenly slammed directly into the center of her chest. She had to keep driving, had to get home. She had to look Rio in the eyes and hear her say it, for real this time. She had to watch Rio's lips as she formed the words, to really know it was true.</p><p>"I won't crash the car, but I cannot promise I'm not going to get a ticket," she returned, her voice tight with the effort it was taking her to keep her emotions in check.</p><p>"If you get a ticket in the eight or less minutes it takes you to get here, I will be amazed."</p><p>"Do not put it past me. And I'm down to four minutes now." Agatha was somehow hyper aware of her surroundings and yet, at the same time she was miles away from being in that car. Only the sound of Rio's voice was managing to keep her from completely spiraling into visions of what their future might look like now that they had the green light.</p><p>"Jesus Christ, Agatha. You really are <i>trying</i> to get pulled over," came Rio's light scolding but Agatha paid it no mind. Instead, she switched lanes as she approached Templeton Parkway and made her designated right turn.</p><p>"I'm almost there. Is the door unlocked?" It seemed like a normal conversation to be having in that her tone was controlled and even despite the fact that Agatha was certain she was only moments away from crawling out of her own skin.</p><p>"It is. I'll see you in a minute."</p><p>"I love you, Rio."</p><p>"I love you too. Now get your ass in here."</p><p>As Agatha reached to the display and disconnected the call, she made a left turn into their driveway and nearly threw the car into park. In her rush to get inside, everything from her laptop bag to her wallet was left on the floor of the passenger's side discarded as she tore out of the car. The door slammed harder than she had intended, but it wasn't a thought in her mind, rapid footfalls carrying her up the front steps.</p><p>What Agatha had not realized until she looked up was that the front door was already open and Rio was standing there waiting.</p><p>With minimal decrease in her pace, Agatha thundered right into her and her arms flew tight around Rio's middle. Her face tucked into the crook of Rio's neck as she battled the emotional war raging inside of her. She could feel Rio's embrace a moment later, one hand around her back and the other smoothing her hair. Agatha let herself be held like that for only a moment before she knew she needed to hear it.</p><p>Lifting her head, her blue eyes found those warm, kind, caring dark honey pools and she found the resolve to make the request that was burning in her chest.</p><p><i>"Tell me,"</i> she nearly begged. <i>"Say it out loud."</i></p><p>Rio's lids brimmed with tears that were almost contradictory to the smile that had found her face, so impossibly tender and relieved.</p><p>
<i>"We got approved. Nicole and I set up the final home inspection for Monday. We preemptively also penciled in the first placement visit, pending the results of the inspection." </i>
</p><p>Agatha could have simply evaporated into thin air at that news. Three months of effort, of jumping through every single hoop they had to, and now they were one step closer to being able to call Stevie theirs.</p><p><i>"When?"</i> Agatha asked, swallowing down the boulder of emotion that sat in the middle of her throat.</p><p>
<i>"Thursday at 5:30. I'll be home by then and you're usually off around 3:30 anyway. Nicole said that if everything goes well, we can plan another that night." </i>
</p><p>All of it made sense but Agatha was still struggling to implement it as reality. How could she grasp the idea that they were finally moving forward on a path that had once seemed like a dream? How, in any plane of existence, did Agatha bring herself to understand that she was being gifted the opportunity to be a mother again?</p><p>She was processing it, trying to input the data and yet it all felt far too surreal. It was all she had been wanting the last twelve weeks or so and now that they were that much closer? Knowing it could only be six more months before they stood in front of a judge and Stevie officially became their daughter? It was a cluster of visions that Agatha had tried not to hinge too heavily on, but they were <i>right there, so close.</i></p><p>Rio released the hold she had around Agatha's middle to bring both hands up, palms finding the angles of Agatha's jaw.</p><p><i>"Hey,"</i> Rio murmured, causing Agatha's gaze to snap back into focus. <i>"What are you thinking right now?"</i></p><p>Having realized that they were still standing in the open doorway, Agatha cleared her throat and gave Rio a little nudge to compel her to step back and once she did, closed the door behind her. As it clicked shut, she leaned forward to press a soft kiss to Rio's lips.</p><p><i>"Do you want some tea?" </i>Agatha asked in a whisper, gazing into Rio's eyes as she pulled away.</p><p>Rio's lips turned down at the corners slightly but she seemed to catch herself. She wasn't upset, necessarily, as it read on her face. What Agatha could see there ran more along the lines of concern.</p><p><i>"I'm okay. But make one for you if it'll help."</i> Rio reached up, giving a soft squeeze to Agatha's bicep as she stepped out of the way so that Agatha could head for the kitchen. When she did, Rio was right behind her.</p><p>Agatha flipped on the kettle but then made no other move to prepare the tea. Instead, she leaned forward on both of her palms, pressing them down against the countertop. Before she could dive into the depths of her thoughts too far, she felt a hand slide up her back and the pressure of Rio's lips against her shoulder.</p><p>Her eyes slid closed and she exhaled a soft sigh, knowing full well that she needed to find a way to speak. This was far beyond writing her feelings out. This was too far past the point of her being able to use her actions to speak for her.</p><p><i>"I..." </i>Agatha attempted but her jaw snapped shut at her inability to locate the correct syntax she was needing to appropriately convey what she was feeling. <i>"I just thought it would never come."</i></p><p>The admittance was weak; she knew it was a silly line of thought in the context of the reality the existed in, but for those long and daunting weeks, she had spent far too many hours thinking about what it would feel like if they were turned away and told no. The idea that they may never get to see Stevie again had plagued her often in the early hours of the morning when she awoke and Rio was still sound asleep by her side.</p><p><i>"I had faith in all we've been doing, but that doubt never really went away. And so... I just... The realization that we might finally be able to get her... I know it's not a definite right now, and I understand what that means... But we are <b>that</b> much closer and it's just..." </i>The longer she tried to speak, the more choked up Agatha was getting.</p><p>Rio's ability to sense it was impeccable and she made her move to try and soothe the warring emotions. She reached for Agatha's hand, carefully prying it from the countertop so that Rio could guide her to turn. Their gazes met again and Rio's calming demeanor surfaced again.</p><p><i>"It's going to work out,"</i> Rio promised her, raising a palm to cup Agatha's cheek. <i>"We're not going to venture down the path of 'what if something goes wrong?' until something actually goes wrong. What we <b>are</b> going to do is show Nicole around our house again on Monday. And then, on Thursday, we're going to have Stevie over where we can make homemade pizzas and show her around. That's the itinerary for now and we're going to stick to it. We can always add to it when the time comes."</i></p><p>Rio had found it, that <i>exact</i> cadence she needed to tame Agatha's wildly beating heart. She knew the right tones to use, and even the right words. Rio knew how to truly <i>speak</i> to Agatha in more than just a verbal sense and that was precisely what she had called upon in those moments.</p><p>Slowly, Agatha found her ability to reel in those emotions. She found a way to center herself and plant roots in the comfort of what Rio was telling her.</p><p><i>"You're right,"</i> Agatha admitted, drawing in a slow breath to steady herself and her racing thoughts.</p><p>
<i>"I usually am. So... Let's get through these next three days until we see Nicole. She and I have already had the unofficial conversation that this is just a formality. Having gotten to know us, she knows we're ready and that we've been waiting for this. All we have to do is what we've been doing, and that's proving that we want Stevie in our lives for as long as we live. We want her to be our daughter. Easy for us, right?"</i>
</p><p>Instead of a vocal answer, or even a nod, Agatha simply turned her head enough so that she could place a tender kiss to Rio's palm, her eyes fluttering shut as she did so.</p><p><i>"I love you, Rio Vidal,"</i> she whispered against the coarse skin there.</p><p>Rio leaned in and pressed her lips to Agatha's temple just as the kettle began to whistle.</p><p>
<i>"I love you too, Agatha Vidal."</i>
</p><p>*****</p><p>The final inspection had come and gone and as Rio had nearly promised Agatha a thousand times, everything had been perfect and, as Nicole had informed them, went well beyond typical expectations.</p><p>"It's clear that you want this," Nicole had told them both as she stopped by the front door. "And... The greenhouse is always my favorite part, as you know. But... Just remember to put a lock on the door before Thursday. I do have to check it while we're here."</p><p>Before Thursday.</p><p>Thursday.</p><p>Three days from that moment, they were going to have Stevie in their home, making a mess in that big kitchen as they prepared themselves dinner.</p><p>"Will do. Is there anything else you can think of?" Rio had asked her, the eagerness ringing bright in her tone.</p><p>"I think you know this already, but having some Reese's on hand might do you a few favors." Nicole's grin was wide and nearly touched both of her soft hazel eyes as she clutched a little tighter to the clipboard she had cradled in the crook of her elbow. "I'll shoot you a text when I tell her. I know she's going to be thrilled."</p><p>"Thank you, Nicole," came Agatha's deliverance of genuine gratitude. "You've been... Amazing through all of this. And we really want you to know how much we appreciate you and the way you care about Stevie."</p><p>Nicole's expression softened and she gave a small nod of acknowledgement. "She's a special little girl."</p><p>"Don't we know it."</p><p>The following days -- <i>those three pesky days</i> -- had been agonizing in just how long they seemed to draw on. It was that classic telling of wanting something just out of reach and time slowing down for the sake of drawing it out. Agatha had occupied herself as much as she could with work, grading papers, and preparing for final exams that were rapidly approaching, but her mind often wandered.</p><p>When she was home, though, it was a little easier to focus. When Rio was next to her and they were submitting Amazon orders for a Nintendo Switch and jump-ropes and far too many Bluey plushies than any child would actually need. Rio was right by her side as they put the clothes they'd bought Stevie into the drawers of the dressers in her room. Rio held her hand as they filled the small jewelry box they had gotten her with rings that would fit her and hairpins with flowers on them.</p><p>When she was home, she didn't have to think about the what-if's because Rio was so <i>damn good</i> at keeping her tethered to the moment they were in, no matter what it was they were doing.</p><p>Class on Thursday morning had been hard. Agatha was entirely distracted by what she knew was coming that evening, and despite her best efforts, she was struggling to focus on what she needed to be doing. Her speech caught during her lecture several times and though she didn't let her embarrassment show, she could see it on the faces of the men and women in those seats that they had gauged something was off.</p><p>None of it was bad. None of it was wrong. It was just overwhelming.</p><p>Seeing their dreams as they began to realize was having a far deeper impact on Agatha than she had ever considered it might, and even though it was tripping her up, she liked it.</p><p>She had ripped right out of that hall the moment she had a chance, throwing everything into the empty seat beside her so that she could make her way to the market to grab a few odds and ends.</p><p>While she was there, she grabbed the biggest bag of Reese's cups she could find with every intention of filling the 'Emotional Support Candy' jar that Rio had procured from online the moment she got home.</p><p>After tossing everything in the back seat and loading herself into the front, Agatha took just a moment to breathe. Once that was completed, she pulled out her phone and shot a text message to Rio.</p><p>
<i>"I know you probably won't see this until you're off work, but I'm leaving the market now. I got everything we'll need. If you think of anything else, well... You'll have to grab it on your way home or too bad. (; I love you. Get home safely."</i>
</p><p>She pressed send and stowed her phone to free her hands to carry in the bags and unlock the front door. Once inside, it was almost as if she had completely shifted into autopilot. Agatha was moving, putting things away, dumping candy into the designated jar. She was so automatic in the way she climbed the stairs to the third floor, only stopping to steal a glance at Stevie's bedroom before she continued onto theirs. Even in her shower, the motions were mindless and routine. Everything Agatha was doing, she was doing it with a single thought looping through her mind over and over again:</p><p>
<i>We get to see Stevie again in less than an hour.</i>
</p><p>As she was rinsing the last of the conditioner from her hair, Agatha's phone rang from the counter.</p><p><i>"Shit," </i>she hissed, trying to work faster in getting her hair rinsed. She gauged that she had approximately four rings left until it went to voicemail. She left the water on as she bolted out and swiped a towel so that she could dry off her hand, having little regard that she was dripping from everywhere else, soaking the tile beneath her.</p><p>That dry hand scooped up her phone and put it on speaker to avoid contact with her still wet hair and face.</p><p>"Hi handsome," she greeted softly, though it was clear she was a little winded.</p><p>"Hi, my love. I am on my way home. I just wanted to make sure there was nothing else you needed before I got there." Rio's voice was so warm and smooth but Agatha could hear it there, vibrating along the edges of her words: pure and raw excitement.</p><p>"I'm okay. And I remembered to get Reese's when I stopped at the market, so we are good on that front. What time even is it? I've been in the shower..."</p><p>Rio breathed a soft chuckle over the line. "It's 5:10. I'm about five minutes away. I won't have time to shower, but I am going to try and clean up before Stevie and Nicole get there."</p><p>"It's still on. I can leave it running for you, if you want," Agatha suggested, her tone sweet and void of its usual mischievousness. As much as she loved Rio, and as much as she loved showing that in a physical sense, this was the one time that she would happily shove those wants to the side to satisfy a greater need.</p><p>"That... would be nice, actually," Rio conceded; Agatha had heard her need to push, to insist it would be fine but they both knew she could use it, however quick it might end up being. "We're turning the corner now, I'll be up in a few. I love you, Agatha."</p><p>"I love you too, baby. See you soon."</p><p>Placing the phone back on the counter, Agatha's eyes dropped to the floor and the massive puddle at her feet that caused her lips to turn down at the corners. Well, all was well that ended well, she supposed. She used the towel still clutched in her hand to dry her hair and body and then retrieved another to soak up the water that was sitting pooled on the tile. As she was hanging them up, she heard the sound of shuffling behind her.</p><p>"You know," Rio plied as she stripped her shirt over her head, tossed it aside, and then began to remove her bra, "if we did not have like ten minutes until Stevie gets here, I would see this as a prime opportunity..."</p><p>Agatha's chin tucked over her shoulder to glance at her wife, who had started shedding her pants and underwear, and a wide grin canvassed her features.</p><p>"Yes, well, priorities, my love," Agatha cooed at her as she turned and crossed the space between them, reaching up to run a lone fingertip down the length of Rio's jaw on the opposite side. "Get clean and then meet me downstairs."</p><p>The way Rio's head turned, as if she was trying to keep that contact just a moment longer, paired with the heat of the adoration in her eyes made Agatha melt in her very middle, but she kept walking as the tip of her finger flicked off of the point of Rio's chin.</p><p>The little grumble that sounded in her wake produced a giggle from her, but she remained focused on her task of dressing herself and making her damp hair appear presentable. She knew she should have budgeted her time a little better, but what was the use in being worried about it after the fact?</p><p>Her eyes met her reflection evenly as she gave herself a once-over. The boot cut jeans on her legs were dark, but it was a nice contrast to the lilac sweatshirt she had pulled on. Her hair was combed and tidy for the time being, but she knew that was likely to change once it started to dry more. The last thing she took in was the sight of her hands, bare thus far. With the smallest smile, she headed for her jewelry box and selected a few rings that Stevie had not yet seen.</p><p>It could have been considered silly, but it was just another small thing Agatha knew herself capable of that could help brighten the little girl's day.</p><p>The facts were that they only got a few hours that night and barring Stevie having an utter meltdown, they would have the chance to do it again. Agatha had to stick to those, to cling to them as if they might offer her just enough hope to not let it crush her if something unpredictable did happen.</p><p>As her feet hit the hardwood on the first floor, Agatha's eyes swept to the clock in the kitchen, a small well of panic forming in her middle.</p><p>"Rio!" she shouted through the opening created by the way the stairs were constructed. "You've got less than five minutes!"</p><p>Agatha had not expected an answer, but she heard a <i>thud</i> overhead, likely in the bedroom, that was followed by a loud <i>Gods be damned! </i>that carried all the way down to the first floor.</p><p>A soft laugh passed through Agatha's lips as the vision of Rio being in such a hurry that she fell over filled her mind. They probably should have pushed the visit at least thirty minutes, but their eagerness had won out and the idea of waiting even a minute more than they had to just seemed too much.</p><p>Only a minute later, from her place in the kitchen as she began pulling things out to make their dinner, Agatha heard Rio's footsteps as she came down the stairs, nearly leaping down them from the sounds of it.</p><p>"My love," Agatha called, fighting a laugh. "They aren't here yet, it's okay."</p><p>"I know but it's 5:29!" Rio cried as she came around the corner. Agatha softened at the sight of her. Her hair was still dry and pinned to the back of her head, but the pen that was usually kept there had been removed. On her torso was a sea green blouse, buttoned up more than usual but enough that her St. Camillus locket was still visible as it sat on her sternum. It was tucked into grey slacks that were secured with a woven leather belt and its gold buckle.</p><p>
<i>Damn she looked good. </i>
</p><p>It wasn't anything new, but it sent Agatha buzzing nearly every time.</p><p>Rio had once informed her during Stevie's stay at the hospital that she had spent ten minutes marveling over that locket and asking questions about it. Of course Rio would want to make it visible so that it was familiar, it was something that might remind Stevie of all the moments they'd spent together in the hospital.</p><p>"It's okay if they're a few minutes late," Agatha supplied in response, finally shutting the door to the refrigerator.</p><p>"I know, I know," Rio sighed, pressing her lips together in a thin line. "I'm just anxious is all."</p><p>Agatha paced over to where Rio stood next to the counter and didn't hesitate to give her a full and reassuring kiss.</p><p>"And that's okay. Because I am, too. But it's happening and we know it's happening. So why don't we just busy our minds while we wait?"</p><p>Rio's hand raised and landed on Agatha's side, her expression melting the slightest bit.</p><p>"I was not expecting you to be the voice of reason, here," Rio admitted honestly.</p><p>"Yeah, well, neither was --"</p><p>Before Agatha could finish speaking, there was a firm knocking at the front door. The resulting grins as they locked eyes were impossibly bright and could have stretched on endlessly past the confinements of human anatomy.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>Stevie was right on the other side of that door.</p><p>They had to get there to remove the only barrier left between them.</p><p>Footsteps were heavy over the wood as they nearly ran, hand-in-hand toward the entrance. It was Rio who reached down first, pulling the door open.</p><p>There, in the warm May evening, stood Stevie in a beige t-shirt that was patterned in rainbows and unicorns. She had a pair of white capris on and little black Crocs on her feet, but the best part of the whole ensemble?</p><p>The best part was the grin that nearly cracked her face in half the moment she saw them.</p><p>"Dr. Rio! Mrs. Agatha!" she squealed in delight, but instead of moving, she looked up at Nicole who met her gaze and gave her a nod. Stevie let go of her hand and turned those grey eyes back to the couple. When she posed her question, her voice was soft, but the excitement was palpable. "Can I hug you?"</p><p>"Yes, I think we would both like that very much," Rio responded, dropping into a squat to open her arms. Without a second thought, Stevie surged forward and wrapped her arms around Rio's neck. It didn't last long, but Agatha could see very clearly that it was long enough to speak every note of why they had taken this all on directly into Rio's ear.</p><p>As predicted, she turned to Agatha who copied Rio's motion to lower herself to Stevie's level.</p><p>"Mrs. Agatha, your sweater is my favorite color," Stevie voiced after she took a moment to really look at Agatha. When Agatha grinned at her in response, Stevie stepped forward and hugged her, too.</p><p>"We are very excited to have you here," Agatha told her as they parted and Agatha joined Rio at full height again.  They stepped back to allow the other two inside.</p><p>"It's good to see you too, Nicole," Rio offered warmly, giving her a tip of her head.</p><p>"You both as well. Starting now, I am merely an observer. I will have to check the lock on the second story, but otherwise, please," Nicole said with a gentle flourish of her hand.</p><p>She had briefed them on how this would look in a text message and the idea of having eyes on her in her own home had unsettled Agatha, but she understood it. It wasn't like they could just drop this little girl in a newly certified foster situation blindly. At the same time, Agatha had the thought that the homes they had seemed to 'vet' before had only caused Stevie more harm than they had ever helped. She still got it, even if it made her uncomfortable.</p><p>Agatha wouldn't stop just because things were uncomfortable. Rio had taught her what it meant to be brave in that regard, and she would draw on it then more than ever to see this through.</p><p>"This is your house?!" Stevie asked in wonder, her eyes sweeping over what was visible of the first floor.</p><p>"It is," Agatha told her, looking down at her with a tender curl of her lips. "Do you want to take a look around?"</p><p>Stevie's wide eyes swept back to Nicole again and her blonde hair rustled slightly as she gave Stevie another encouraging nod.</p><p>"You don't have to ask me permission, sweetheart. Just hang out with them, remember? Whatever you want to know or do, you just have to ask them." Nicole's words were encouraging, but she was speaking to Stevie's history, to the things they had learned in the last few weeks.</p><p>Stevie had been in the system since she was just under a year old. She had been in a total of seven homes since then and was often forced into new placement due to 'behavioral issues,' which Nicole had supplemented in a text message as being physical combatancy with other boys in the homes. Stevie had also been hospitalized four times in the year leading up to her being placed in Rio's care, all at different hospitals. The breaks they had seen on those x-rays had been years old and had simply never healed right because she had never properly been taken care of.</p><p>In that last year, she'd been in the same home and each instance of needing medical care had been somehow explained away and no one had given enough of a shit to recognize a pattern. It was infuriating in the most honest sense of the word, but Agatha and Rio were going to put a stop to the cycle. They were actively trying, yes, but Agatha had the resolve that it was going to work. This <i>had</i> to work.</p><p>"Okay, thank you Ms. Nikki," Steve answered and for a split second, time seemed to stop.</p><p>It didn't make any sense. Agatha knew exactly who Stevie was talking to, but to hear her say that name? To her her say a different name and yet the same name Agatha still held so close to her heart? It was an emotional gut punch of the most unexpected variety. The shock had presented itself in Agatha's features just enough that Rio cleared her throat to try and reel her back in.</p><p>Blinking, Agatha found herself back in the moment, looking down at a little doe-eyed Stevie who was awaiting their direction.</p><p>"We can start down here," Rio volunteered, pointing to the small hallway on the other side of the living room.</p><p>As Agatha began to walk forward, something caught her off guard. It was the feeling of a small hand wrapping around three of her fingers. Her breath hooked at the tops of her lungs for just a moment before she forced herself to exhale it, looking down at Stevie with a sweet curl of her lips.</p><p>Stevie's eyes dropped from her face to the hand she was holding, her grin taking her over in the same moment.</p><p>"You picked good rings today Mrs. Agatha," Stevie informed her matter-of-factly, as if she were the absolute authority on rings now.</p><p>"I see you still have yours," Agatha returned as they paced toward the end of the hall.</p><p>Stevie's small hand raised and touched the ring that hung around her neck, fingertips brushing the metal ever so softly.</p><p>"I didn't let anybody take it. I made you a promise I was gonna keep it safe." Stevie's voice was so sure, so confident that she had absolutely managed to -- so far -- accomplish the task Agatha had given to her by means of gifting her that ring.</p><p>"You did a very good job of that," Agatha complimented.</p><p>"Do you want it back now?" the little girl questioned and for just a moment, Agatha felt something in her squeeze.</p><p>"No, sweet girl, that's yours forever now." Agatha meant it, but Stevie never could have known just how much.</p><p>Ahead of them, Rio opened the door to what was now Agatha's office that housed the desk that used to be in her townhome and her books that lined the shelves.</p><p>"This is Mrs. Agatha's office," Rio informed her. "When she has to grade papers or do stuff for class, she's always in here."</p><p>"You have lots of books!" Stevie exclaimed, marveling at the packed shelves on the far wall.</p><p>"I like to read. Maybe I can read to you sometime," came Agatha's suggestion and that sweet, sweet sound of Stevie's giggle filled the air around them.</p><p>"I like that," Stevie agreed as the bubbles of laughter subsided.</p><p>Rio shut the door and turned, indicating another doorway that she pushed open enough to reveal its contents. "There's a bathroom here," she indicated before pulling the door shut and crossing the hallway to another. "And this room is empty for now, but we have some ideas we're gonna work on soon." Rio mimicked the same action of revealing the room for just long enough before she shut the door again.</p><p>The three of them shuffled back toward the open living room, dining area, and kitchen. Stevie's eyes were alert and actively scanning everywhere they went, everything she was seeing. She would ask occasional questions, ones that were always so sweetly innocent even as they migrated to the second floor, Nicole trailing in her observatory state just behind them.</p><p>Rio took them to one side of the floor and then the other, showing Stevie each room and indicating what it was used for. When they reached the door to the greenhouse, Rio fished the key out of her pocket, casting a knowing grin in Nicole's direction.</p><p>"This," Rio explained as she pushed open the door, "is my greenhouse. It is also my happy place."</p><p>The immediate high-pitched sound of pure excitement that hit the air as Stevie took in the sights of the flowers caused Agatha to flush from head to toe. She knew how much that greenhouse meant to Rio and she knew how much it would mean to Rio to be able to share it with Stevie.</p><p>"Dr. Rio! There are so many flowers! How do you have so many flowers?!" she asked excitedly as she began to step forward, tugging on Agatha's hand as she did so. Rio stepped in ahead of them and gestured for Stevie to follow her inside. The little girl obliged, bringing Agatha in tow.</p><p>They spent close to fifteen minutes in there from the moment Stevie asked if Agatha could lift her up so she could see better. The very second her small form fit to Agatha's side, it was all Agatha could do to keep from melting. As they paced the lengths of the tables, Rio indicated and detailed what each flower was and a little bit about the care it needed.</p><p>They made their way around the entire room and as they exited and Agatha set Stevie back on her feet, she was still buzzing over the sights inside the room.</p><p>"That's how you know so much about flowers, huh, Dr. Rio?"</p><p>"It is. I did a lot of research so that I could grow them and take care of them. They're very important to me." Rio's explanation was cautious, but it was accurate. What Stevie was going to learn was that the things that were most important to Rio got the most care. Agatha was living, breathing proof of that.</p><p>"Do you want to go see your room for when you stay the night with us?" Agatha asked her as Rio pulled the door to the greenhouse shut and locked it behind her.</p><p>"I have a room?! By myself?!" Stevie nearly shrieked, eyes as big as saucers and filled with utter wonder.</p><p>"You do," came Rio's bright response.</p><p>"And... Dr. Rio made sure it was extra special just for you," Agatha assured, casually indicating the stairs.</p><p>"I wanna see!" Stevie exclaimed, this time moving to pick up Rio's hand as she pulled her toward the stairs. Rio's laughter was immediate, but they were both amused and touched by just how thrilled Stevie seemed to be, it was just that Agatha's emotion wasn't able to make a sound.</p><p>She stood there for a moment just watching the two head up the stairs, Stevie probing on how the room was special and Rio insisting she just had to wait and see. The way Rio's chin tucked as she looked to her side while Stevie was focused on making it up the stairs, it was this picture perfect moment of what the rest of Agatha's life might actually look like.</p><p>"As much as I am to make a judgement call, how long this goes on depends on her," came Nicole's voice as she stepped up beside Agatha.</p><p>"Huh?" Agatha asked, only having half heard what the other woman had said.</p><p>"We do have to implement the rule of a weekend stay before any major decisions are made, but... When she's comfortable, I'm able to initiate permanent placement. And I... do not foresee that taking very long." The woman's words were soft, but Agatha could hear the intent behind them. Nicole had been on their side since the day she'd met Rio at the hospital when Stevie had first been brought in. She had a first hand view of the way Rio and Agatha had been so willing to move mountains to give this beautiful little girl a life she so justly deserved.</p><p>Agatha turned her head to take in the blonde woman's profile, just studying her, searching for any give that might signify she was bluffing.</p><p>"It can't be that easy," Agatha commented, her brow pinching above her nose.</p><p>"Usually it's not. But... She's already spent quite a bit of time with you both. The circumstances have made this a unique situation. But... Your interview? All the inspections? You've both made it look so effortless and that goes a long way when making a final decision."</p><p>Sure, they'd had to answer a lot of questions, had filled out pages of paperwork, had been vetted and processed so thoroughly, and Nicole had learned a lot about them in that time, but professionally speaking, it probably wasn't commonplace for her to be so candid. She could have kept it by the book, could have offered only what she technically should, but it had always been apparent that employment-forced-indifference aside, Nicole was their biggest cheerleader.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to speak again but she was silenced before she could by a call from up the stairs.</p><p>"Mrs. Agatha! We are waiting for you!"</p><p>The two women at the foot of the stairs laughed in unison and Agatha heeded the call, heading up to meet the two of them with Nicole a couple of steps behind her.</p><p>Agatha reached the top and the moment she took in the sight of Stevie, still clutching Rio's hand in her much smaller one, she could see the excitement rolling off of her in waves.</p><p>"I wanna see!" Stevie gushed, her eyes trained on Agatha as she closed the space between them.</p><p>"Alright, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hold you up!" Agatha apologized in a chuckle, her eyes meeting Rio's for a fleeting second before Rio pushed open the door and motioned for Stevie to step inside.</p><p>The moment she did, Agatha was not even sure what she could have called the sounds that were consecutively escaping Stevie, but she did know that they were sounds of purely wholesome joy.</p><p>"That's a big Bluey!" Stevie gushed, padding over to the wall to run her palm along it, as if touching it might make it real. "And Bingo! And there's Muffin!" She was clearly over the moon, transfixed by the mural enough that she did not care for anything else in the room. "How did you get the big Bluey on the wall?!"</p><p>As Stevie turned back to look at them, Agatha tipped her head in Rio's direction.</p><p>"Dr. Rio painted it for you. She wanted you to have something fun to look at when you're playing or laying down for bed."</p><p>Stevie zeroed in on Rio and the look on her face was unidentifiable; it was similar to amazement, but there was something else there.</p><p>"You did?!" The disbelief was clear in her tone, but there was an edge of excitement there, too.</p><p>"I did," Rio said with a nod, her voice as warm as the smile that had pushed up the corners of her lips.</p><p>"Did it take you a long time?" Stevie questioned, looking back at the wall before her.</p><p>"Not too long. Do you like it?" Rio probed, though it had been an unnecessary inquiry.</p><p>Stevie turned all the way around and seemed to read the moment. After only a second, she pushed forward and wrapped her arms around Rio's legs, squeezing them tight.</p><p>"I like it a whole lot, Dr. Rio. Thank you."</p><p>As Agatha absorbed everything about that moment, a sudden thought popped into her head. They had been told that Stevie had been passed along from home to home because she had behavioral issues. Seeing right then just how capable of being gentle and respectful Stevie was made Agatha wonder just how bad things had to have been for her to gain such a reputation.</p><p>They had finished the rest of the tour with letting Stevie know where their bedroom -- which had been stripped of Rio's artwork that had been stowed in the closet, with a bemused "That's the last place I thought you'd ever try to put me" from Agatha -- was in case she needed them when she stayed the night.</p><p>When Rio had asked her if she was hungry and she admitted she was, Agatha was the one to offer the invitation to help them make dinner.</p><p>"We got some things to make pizza, if you'd like to help us?"</p><p>Yet again, Stevie's disbelief was apparent, as was her absolute animation over not only being offered one of her favorites, but being asked to help as well.</p><p>"We made sure to get mushrooms and green peppers," Rio informed her as they began their descent to the first floor. "And we even picked up a jar of yellow peppers, too, in case you wanted them today."</p><p>"The kinda spicy ones?!" Stevie pressed and Rio gave a nod as they hit the ground floor.</p><p>And so, the three of them had set to work in the kitchen, Rio having pulled a chair from the dining table over so that Stevie could kneel at the edge of the counter. Nicole had placed herself at that dining table, having given up on taking notes at that point, instead just watching, learning, understanding.</p><p>The way Stevie could hardly stop giggling as she gave her best attempt at spreading the sauce across the crust with the back of a spoon had Agatha feeling like she could have just floated away, never to be seen again with just the right gust of wind.</p><p>She had caught Rio's eye more than once throughout the process and each and every time, they conjured matching smiles before trying to divert their attention back to the task at hand.</p><p>The truth of it was, this was everything they could have hoped for and more. Stevie was so engaging, so willing to help and ask questions and put forth an effort to understand, even in her own five-year-old way. Agatha could not even begin to imagine what this was like for her, but all she knew was that they could make it better. They could provide her stability and affection.</p><p>Agatha and Rio could love Stevie like no one else had ever cared enough to.</p><p>While they had waited for the pizzas to bake, the four of them had relocated to the living room where they presented Stevie with some of the toys they had gotten for her, letting her play on the floor as the three women held light discussion. They talked about the recent weather, popular attractions going on at that time of year, and up and coming restaurants in the area. When the timer had gone off, Stevie was the first one on her feet, her eager gaze turning to Agatha first, then Rio as she waited for them to move into action.</p><p>Agatha stood, grinning down at her as they crossed over to the kitchen to remove their dinner from the oven. As Agatha set the hot pizza on the cooling rack, Stevie had spun around to face the living room.</p><p>"Ms. Nikki! Are you going to eat pizza with us?!" she asked excitedly. That time it didn't strike Agatha quite as hard; she was a little more prepared, or at least aware it could happen.</p><p>"There's plenty," Agatha assured, her eyes casting out toward the other two women, "you should."</p><p>The four of them sat at that table, enjoying their pizza -- which Stevie pointed out no less than four times was better than 'store pizza' because they had made it themselves -- and more conversation, though it was more centered on Stevie. By the time they were done and Agatha cleared their dishes, she was too aware of what time it was, even before Nicole speak.</p><p>"Well, it's about time fo us to go," she announced and Agatha's gaze immediately cut to Stevie.</p><p>The look on her small face fell instantly.</p><p>"We have to leave?" she asked, her voice timid. Agatha may have misheard, but she could have sworn there was the slightest tremble.</p><p>"We do," Nicole told her. "But... How would you feel about coming back next week? And... Maybe staying the night next weekend?"</p><p>At this, the muscles in Stevie's face went lax as she seemed to consider.</p><p>"I get to come back?" she questioned, her gaze starting on Rio before it shifted to Agatha, and then finally Nicole.</p><p>"You do. How about... Wednesday?" Nicole offered, her own eyes lifting to Agatha and Rio who both offered a nod almost at the exact same time.</p><p>"How many days away is that?" Stevie inquired as she landed on Agatha this time.</p><p>"It's six days. Not quite a week. Do you think you can hang on six days? We can do whatever you want when you come back." Agatha was already dreading watching the two of them walk out of that door, but if they could have a promise of more time? It would be something she could use as a lifeline, something she could keep hold of to know that better things were on the horizon.</p><p>"We can watch Bluey?" Stevie asked, her tone hiking with her interest.</p><p>"Absolutely," Rio answered.</p><p>Much to Agatha's surprise, that actually seemed to work. In fact, Stevie held both hands up in front of her, counting all five fingers on one hand and then the additional on the other.</p><p>"Six," she muttered to herself before she looked up from her work, gorgeous grey eyes landing directly into Agatha's blue ones. "I can do six."</p><p>The mother in Agatha wanted to lean over, to kiss the top of her head and tell her that she believed in her. The rational Agatha instead offered a sincere smile and a nod of her head.</p><p>"You can. And we will be ready and excited when you come back." Agatha was doing all she could to not let the emotion touch her voice in the way it was fighting to, instead lifting her eyes to her wife's. She could see that same emotion that wanted to be heard in her as it wrote itself across Rio's face.</p><p>They knew this was inevitable, but they didn't want to say goodbye more than Stevie didn't.</p><p>Finally, they all stood and migrated toward the door. As they reached it, Nicole turned to face them.</p><p>"We'll see you Wednesday?" she posed.</p><p>Rio had started to speak, but she was cut off by a shrill squeal from Stevie.</p><p>"Are those for me?!" she cried in question. As Agatha's gaze dropped, she immediately realized what Stevie had seen.</p><p>"They are, but only one at a time," Rio answered, making her way over to the glass candy jar. She removed the lid -- which looked like the top of a cupcake -- and dropped her hand inside so that she could remove one of the peanut butter cups. She placed the lid back atop the jar and moved to squat again in front of Stevie. She held it out and tilted her head slightly.</p><p>"Whenever you're having a tough time, or you're upset... You just let one of us know and you can have one of those, yeah?" Rio's explanation was simple enough, but there was something deeper there, Agatha knew. It was a very simple way of explaining to Stevie, even so early on, that it was okay for her to ask them for the things she needed. It was a smart way of going about it, a way she could easily understand.</p><p>"Okay. Thank you, Dr. Rio."</p><p>"Of course, Stevie. We're gonna see you real soon, okay?" Rio was exhibiting a rare side of her, a very soft-spoken one that Agatha had only witnessed a couple of times herself.</p><p>"Can I hug you again, Dr. Rio?" Stevie asked her quietly. She would come to realize, eventually, that Rio's answer to that question was never going to be no.</p><p>In silent response, Rio's arms opened wide and Stevie stepped into them, hugging herself tight to Rio by the hold she secured around Rio's neck. This one was a little longer than the embrace they had shared just a couple of hours earlier and Agatha could see in Stevie's face -- her eyes closed and muscles scrunched -- that she was committing the feeling to memory in her own way.</p><p>When they parted, her grey and soft eyes turned up to take in Agatha, the sweetest smile curling those thin little lips. "Can I hug you too, Mrs. Agatha?"</p><p>"Of course, sweetheart," Agatha returned, leaning down with open arms that Stevie ran straight into. In a move that was complete muscle memory, Agatha straightened back up, pulling Stevie up with her as they hugged.</p><p><i>"I'm gonna see you soon, right?"</i> Stevie asked softly in a request for reassurance as she pulled back but did not go far with the way Agatha was still holding her.</p><p><i>"Quick as can be. You put a finger down every day and when you have no fingers left to put down, you'll be here that night. Can you keep track of that for me?" </i>Her words were low and smooth, but they held her promise in them. They held her promise to Stevie that this was just a 'see-you-later' as opposed to a 'goodbye.'</p><p>Agatha set her back on her feet an stepped back as she watched Nicole hold out a hand for Stevie to take.</p><p>"Have a good night, okay?" Rio offered as Nicole opened the door.</p><p>"Okay," Stevie agreed with a nod. She glanced up at Nicole and then to Agatha and Rio. "Bye, Dr. Rio and Mrs. Agatha. I'll see you when I don't have any fingers left."</p><p>"Goodnight, Stevie," came the joint harmony of both women, though it was nearly broken by the laughter at what, exactly, Stevie had said.</p><p>"Goodnight, ladies," Nicole voice as well, throwing one more wave before she shut the door behind her.</p><p>The embrace that happened between Agatha and Rio was instant. They'd done it. They'd really done it. And they had plans to do it again! And they were already looking at the possibility of a weekend visit the following weekend?!</p><p>It was really moving, now, and the two of them took the night to revel in it. The rest of their time before bed had been spent in bed, clothed, with Rio wrapped around Agatha as they shared quiet murmurs about their favorite parts of the evening and how excited they were for Stevie's inevitable return.</p><p>While Agatha had thought that time might crawl as it had the three days prior, she was pleasantly surprised to find that it had not. Instead, they ran through their routines, they tended to work and typical responsibilities and before they had even realized it, Wednesday had rolled right into them.</p><p>That visit had gone even better. They had actually ended up watching Big Hero 6 at Rio's suggestion and when Stevie had declared that she hadn't seen it, Rio had promised she would love it.</p><p>Agatha had actually never seen it either, but the longer they watched, the more Agatha was holding onto the fact that she was absolutely going to start teasingly referring to Rio as her very own Baymax. The healer, the one capable of the most intense soothing, and yet, the one capable of becoming more with the right support.</p><p>Rio had support now. Rio had Agatha and Stevie. The two of them would always support Rio in becoming whatever it was she wanted to be. Agatha was resolute in that fact.</p><p>After sharing a dinner of imitation chicken nuggets -- which Stevie had not clocked -- and macaroni and cheese, they found themselves doing the parting dance again. This time, though Stevie realized she only had to count down three fingers instead of six.</p><p>"Saturday?!" Stevie had nearly gasped. "That's the weekend!"</p><p>"It is," Agatha agreed with a punctuating nod.</p><p>"I'm going to bring you over that afternoon," Nicole told Stevie, who was playing with the wrapped Reese's cup in her hands, though her eyes were locked on the social worker. "And if you're okay with it, you're going to stay the night here. Do you think that would be alright?"</p><p>Stevie shifted to look up at Agatha and Rio, as if she were silently asking the same question.</p><p>"We would like it very much if you did," Rio told her and that seemed to be all the answer Stevie had been looking for.</p><p>"I think that's okay," the little girl agreed, gripping a little tighter at Nicole's fingers.</p><p>"Good," Agatha affirmed, her smile so tender and sweet in its adoration of that small little human she'd grown so fond of. "We will see you in three days. Have good dreams tonight, okay?"</p><p>With another exchange of warm hugs, they had departed again and it felt like a sense of deja vu. Yet, this time there was a budding excitement there. They'd moved forward on the board once more. They were even closer to getting a chance at additional time with Stevie which was ultimately the main goal. It was hard not to want to stomp on the gas, to just sail fully through the rest of the process with little regard to the standards that had been set, but Agatha knew that it would be worth it if they could hang on just a little longer.</p><p>She had been right.</p><p>The weekend had arrived and there was a new tinge to the nervous energy that had been buzzing around the house. This was the first visit where Nicole was not going to be present and it was also the longest of the ones they'd had up to that point.</p><p>As Agatha had learned in her brief exchange with Nicole during the first visit, this could really be it. This could be the final hurdle they had to jump over for the time being, but that control was in Stevie's hands.</p><p>Agatha had once thrived on her sense of control. She had thrived even more when she had allowed Rio to hold some of that control. Now, every bit of control in this situation sat in the hands of a five-year-old. Oh how the Agatha from a year ago would have been having an absolute stroke.</p><p>When Nicole had turned up to drop Stevie off at 2pm that Saturday with a bag of clothes and a promise that they could reach out if they needed absolutely anything, Stevie had been absolutely vibrating with her excitement. She had asked a couple of times in the first ten minutes if she really got to sleep in the Bluey room, completely flabbergasted both times when Rio assured her she could.</p><p>They had decided to let Stevie make the call as to what their agenda should start with and her choice had been to play in the backyard and look at the flowers out there, too. Agatha and Rio had sat in the Adirondack chairs as Stevie ran around the backyard, bouncing between examining the flowers and playing with her shovel and bucket, digging her own little hole that she announced she was going to plant a flower in one day.</p><p>At dinner, Stevie had glanced up from her tomato soup and grilled cheese -- that Agatha had successfully made without incident -- to look toward the front door, as if she were waiting for something.</p><p>"What is it, Stevie?" Agatha questioned, her voice curious but soft.</p><p>"When is Ms. Nikki coming to take me away?" she inquired, turning her head back as those grey eyes found Agatha.</p><p>"You're staying with us tonight, remember?" Rio reminded her, slowly reaching up in a way that gave Stevie plenty of time to stop her, before she placed her fingertips over the smaller forearm. "She'll be back tomorrow to get you, but tonight we're gonna keep our promise and let you sleep in the Bluey room."</p><p>The excitement this normally brought to Stevie in the previous mentions did not seem to fill her this time. Instead, she simply looked relieved.</p><p>"I like that," she finally offered, reaching up to grab her cup that was filled with grape juice so that she could take a drink.</p><p>"We do too, kid," Rio responded.</p><p>They had spent the rest of the evening watching a couple of episodes of Bluey before they turned on Ratatouille, this time as a result of Stevie's beguiling. Agatha had popped a bag of popcorn and the three of them had gathered on the couch. Stevie did not hesitate to place herself directly between the two of them, giggling in delight when the bowl of popcorn was put into her lap.</p><p>There had been roughly twenty minutes left in the movie when Agatha realized that both Stevie and Rio had been relatively quiet for a little too long. She turned her head and what she saw melted her from head to toe.</p><p>Rio's head was tipped to rest against the backing of the couch, her mouth hanging open slightly. Her chest rose and fell slowly, the pace tapered by her slumber. There, tucked into her side with almost the same expression, Stevie was sound asleep. For the longest moment, Agatha just watched them. She watched her wife there, sleeping, with a little girl they so badly wanted to be their daughter comfortably fit against her like she belonged absolutely nowhere else.</p><p>Agatha realized in that very moment that for as much as she still missed Nicky sometimes, she never would have had anything like this with him. She had been selfish in her desire to keep him to herself, but with Stevie?</p><p>Stevie was already <i>theirs.</i> She just didn't know it yet.</p><p>The film had continued on and the credits had rolled, but there had been only a couple of instances where Agatha looked away from the true sight before her, Rio and Stevie so snug and serene.</p><p>Agatha hadn't wanted to break the moment, to disturb such a grand vision, but they all three needed to be put in bed. It was Rio she chose to wake first, reaching over to give her knee a quick squeeze. It took a couple of more, but Rio finally stirred. The groggy confusion was impossibly adorable as Agatha watched her fight to make sense of the situation she woke up to.</p><p>The moment Rio glanced down to see Stevie asleep against her side? Her face softened, first, and then her head lifted so that her eyes locked with Agatha's in the dim light of the television. They glimmered with tears and Agatha provided a comforting curve of her lips in return.</p><p><i>"I'll carry her to bed. You should go to ours," </i>Agatha suggested knowingly, giving her head a slight tilt as if to offer an end to any protest before Rio could think to offer it. Agatha got to her feet and easily scooped Stevie into her arms, something in her settling heavy like a stone at just how thin and frail she felt in Agatha's hold like that.</p><p><i>"I want to -- ahhhhh -- tuck her in with you,"</i> Rio pushed through a yawn, digging a knuckle into a closed eye as if she was going to succeed in clearing the sleep there.</p><p><i>"Okay, c'mon then."</i> Agatha's agreement came easily because she knew what it meant to Rio to be present for a first like that one. Agatha knew how she would feel as they collectively put their little girl into her bed for the first time and left her with the hope that only the best dreams might find her.</p><p>Quietly, Rio lifted herself off of the couch and followed Agatha to the third floor and into Stevie's room. In a move that provided silent assistance, Rio pulled back the comforter on the bed so that Agatha could place Stevie gingerly on the mattress. Together, they both pulled up the comforter and made sure she was covered well enough to be comfortable and warm.</p><p><i>"Sweet dreams, beautiful girl,"</i> Rio crooned from Agatha's side.</p><p>Agatha reached between them and picked up Rio's hand, guiding her wordlessly to their bedroom. Once inside, Agatha tugged her to the foot of the bed and turned to face her. Without speaking, she reached down and gave a tug on the material of Rio's blouse so that she could untuck it from her slacks. Before she began work on the buttons, she first unfastened the belt around Rio's hips, freeing it enough that she could unhook the clip beneath it that was sewn into the fabric.</p><p>It only took the slightest tug for Rio's pants to drop to the ground, pooling around her ankles. As Agatha began the task of loosening the buttons, she leaned forward enough to grace Rio's lips with a warm and emotional kiss, using it as a way to try and explain to Rio everything she couldn't currently figure out how to say in words.</p><p>The last button came free and Agatha separated their lips, her hands raising to slide under the fabric so that she could push it over Rio's shoulders. It, too, fell to the ground.</p><p>The next moment, Rio reached forward to curl her fingers into the fabric of Agatha's sweatshirt. She gave a light tug and pulled up, her instruction clear without her saying a word. Agatha lifted her arms, allowing for the removal of the garment before Rio tossed it aside. She made quick work of Agatha's jeans as well, leaving them in only their undergarments.</p><p>Agatha had every intention of heading for the closet, but Rio beat her to the punch. She was quick as she disappeared inside and returned just a minute later. She had already pulled on a t-shirt and a pair of shorts and she held the same items for Agatha in her hand.</p><p>Once dressed for bed, they climbed in on their respective sides and met in their typical fashion toward the center of the bed. Agatha placed herself in her designated spot against Rio's side, her head landing on Rio's chest. The moment she felt an arm wrap around her back, she let her eyes slide closed.</p><p><i>"Guess what?"</i> Rio whispered into the night.</p><p><i>"Hm?"</i> Agatha responded, though it had to be clear just how tired she was.</p><p><i>"Stevie's asleep down the hall."</i> Even though her voice was so impossibly low, Agatha could hear just how giddy that fact made Rio. Truthfully, it made Agatha that giddy too.</p><p><i>"Mmhmm, we made that happen,"</i> Agatha reminded her, the smile she was wearing audible in her voice, even in its whispered state.</p><p><i>"We did," </i>Rio confirmed. <i>"And it's made me realize just <b>how much</b> I love you."</i></p><p>
<i>"I hope you know I love you just as much."</i>
</p><p>
<i>"I've never questioned it for a second."</i>
</p><p>*****</p><p>The next morning, Agatha had been the first one up -- or so she thought -- and had taken her time in her morning routine. She brushed her teeth, tried to tame her wild hair, and washed her face. As she made her way down the hall, she was surprised to hear Stevie's soft musings filtering out from inside her room. When she peered inside, Stevie was sat on her bed, playing with a couple of the plushies they had bought for her.</p><p>She must have seen Agatha out of the corner of her eye because her head pulled up and a wide smile found her lips.</p><p>"Good morning, Mrs. Agatha," she greeted brightly.</p><p>"Good morning, Stevie. Did you sleep okay?" Agatha asked back, tilting her head slightly.</p><p>Stevie nodded, her eyes dropping to her stuffed animals before they lifted again. "I like it when the mean kids don't wake me up," she admitted, though it was nothing more than a fact for her.</p><p>"No mean kids here," Agatha offered lightly, her eyes soft and her voice rich in its honesty. She was quiet for just a moment before she made her suggestion. "I'm going to go downstairs and make us some pancakes for breakfast. Would you like to come help me?"</p><p>"You know how to make pancakes? I love pancakes!" Stevie exclaimed, climbing with haste off of her bed and nearly running over to Agatha.</p><p>"Sure do," Agatha responded, her tone chipper as she held her hand out for Stevie to take. "And I can teach you, too."</p><p>Of course, little of what Agatha did that morning was actually going to plant in Stevie's mind quite yet, but she watched, transfixed in her vested interest as Agatha mixed the batter, poured the pancakes and cut the fruit that they would have with them. She asked her questions and made her observations, never once failing to make Agatha smile.</p><p>She had flipped the last of the pancakes onto the pile at the same moment a sleepy Rio came shuffling into the kitchen.</p><p>"Good morning, girls," she cooed at them, causing both Agatha to grin though she did not turn around, and Stevie to giggle as she whipped her head to take in Rio.</p><p>"Good morning Dr. Rio! Mrs. Agatha and me made pancakes for breakfast. Do you like pancakes?"</p><p>"I do," Rio affirmed as she approached the pot of coffee Agatha had started for her. There was also a mug next to it, awaiting her arrival. "I like mine with blueberries and raspberries."</p><p>"Mrs. Agatha washed some for you!" Stevie gushed, pointing at the bowl of berries.</p><p>"Well, I could sure get used to this," Rio mused as she collected her mug and paced over to place a kiss to Agatha's cheek.</p><p>"Maybe you should," Agatha returned knowingly, her blind hope shining through.</p><p>They had enjoyed breakfast and got dressed for the day, part of which had included taking a walk around the neighborhood to enjoy the perfect spring weather as the sun hung bright in the sky, not a cloud to be seen.</p><p>The way they had walked down the sidewalk with Stevie between the two of them, each of her hands secured in either Agatha's or Rio's, it was that actual picturesque moment of two parents and their child, both in their complete peace but also steadfast in their desire to protect her, to each have a hold on her that ensured she would not go far from them.</p><p>If only that could have applied in every facet of the relationship they were building with her.</p><p>In the late afternoon, Nicole had returned to pick Stevie up and this time?</p><p>This time Agatha could feel as it started to hurt, knowing they had to say goodbye again. What Nicole had to offer, though, felt very similar to more hope.</p><p>"We can do two evening visits this week, if you're available?" she proposed and their agreement had been instant.</p><p>Rio was the first to speak. "Tuesday and Thursday would probably work best."</p><p>"Tuesday it is then. Is 5:30 okay again?"</p><p>"That will work." As was routine at this point, Agatha dropped to Stevie's level, her demeanor lax and kind. "Two fingers this time, okay?"</p><p>Stevie took a moment to ponder this before she posed her question. "Do I get to sleep in the Bluey room again?"</p><p>Agatha breathed an airy laugh, though it was hard to keep her lips from turning down at the corners.</p><p>"Not that time. Maybe next weekend, okay?"</p><p>Stevie nodded, but her attention quickly diverted to the jar on the table in the foyer. "Can I take one with me?" she asked, raising a little finger to point at the collection of Reese's cups.</p><p>"Of course," Rio answered immediately as she fetched one and moved to squat before that beautiful little girl. She held it out and Agatha could tell that Rio didn't want to part ways just as much as Agatha herself did not. "We'll see you super soon, okay?"</p><p>Once more, Stevie gave a nod and then in a move that surprised all three of the adults, she silently threw her small arms around Rio's neck, squeezing her with as much might as she could muster.</p><p>"See you super soon," Stevie agreed with a nod as she pulled away.</p><p>Next, Stevie routinely turned to Agatha, but this time, she raised her hands up to indicate that she <i>wanted</i> to be picked up this time. Agatha obliged her with ease, scooping her up into her arms. Instantly, Stevie's knees locked around her sides and her arms wrapped tight around Agatha's neck.</p><p>
<i>"See you super soon, sweet girl."</i>
</p><p>After a moment longer, Agatha set her back down and she took the couple of steps over to Nicole, taking her hand so that they could leave.</p><p>"Bye Dr. Rio and Mrs. Agatha. See you super soon." She offered the smallest wave and Nicole bid her own goodbyes, casting them a look that Agatha could not quite identify before they passed through the door and Nicole pulled it shut behind them.</p><p>As was usual when Stevie departed, Agatha wrapped herself around Rio and they simply stood in the weight of being the only ones in the house again.</p><p>The general mood had been a little heavier in the hours that passed, but Agatha had tried to lift it by offering to make them dinner while they shared in a drink. Rio had agreed and as Agatha began to pull things out for their meal, Rio set about fixing them each a glass of bourbon. Mid-pour on the first one, her phone dinged from its place on the counter next to her.</p><p>Rio finished her task but put the bottle down before she tended to the second glass. Agatha glanced up as Rio read the message and was immediately concerned. Rio was pale and her mouth was agape just enough to flag an alert.</p><p>"Rio?"</p><p>Rio didn't move. She just kept reading.</p><p>"Rio, hey," Agatha tried again, abandoning her work to approach her wife, an easy hand sliding onto her back between her shoulder blades. "What's going on?"</p><p>"It's... It's Nicole," Rio forced out in a stammer. "She... She said that she talked to Stevie on the way back to her current home. Stevie told her... She told Nicole that she wants to stay here all of the time." Rio's voice was quaky and uneven but Agatha knew it was only a projection of how they were both feeling. She continued, though, and Agatha's heart just about stopped. "She also said that she can bring her tomorrow night for permanent placement."</p><p>Those words slammed into Agatha like a ten ton anvil had been throttled directly into her chest. Nicole had told her, and she'd gotten it, but in that moment? The understanding laid over her heavy and comforting like a weighted blanket.</p><p>It had all been in Stevie's hands.</p><p>And Stevie had chosen them.</p>

<em>This is the last time.</em>
</p><p>It was on a loop in Agatha's mind as she and Rio paced hand-in-hand to the front door as Nicole offered a rapping that would hopefully be her last. </p><p>This really was it, at least it was the most definitive answer Agatha and Rio were going to get for the time being. They weren't out of the woods yet; they had another six months, roughly, before they would officially complete the process. In that moment, knowing that as soon as one of them pulled that door open and Stevie stepped inside?</p><p>She would be home.</p><p>She would be with the only two people who could love her as much as they did. </p><p>She would be with a family that wanted to see her grow, one that would shower her daily with endless affection and unbridled love.</p><p>Stevie would never have to fear for her own wellbeing ever, ever again.</p><p>Upon approach, Agatha had wound up being the closer one and utilized her position to extend an arm toward that solid, resolute door and wrapped her hand around the brass knob. All she had to do was turn it and give it a pull and the last physical barrier between the two of them and Stevie would simply be gone. Removed. Discarded. Useless. </p><p>Agatha had intended to take a breath to steady itself, but her physical form cared little for the soothing of her nerves. Nearly beyond her own cognition, mid-breath, she twisted the handle and pulled the door open.</p><p>On that front step stood an absolutely beaming Stevie. With the brightness of her grin, Agatha couldn't help but think that she understood it, that she knew what it meant the moment she took a step toward them. She had to know, Agatha thought, just from the look in her eyes.</p><p>"Stevie!" Rio greeted enthusiastically, her pitch tremulous for only a moment before she reigned it in. Before she could even stoop to Stevie's level, the little girl was surging forward and running into Rio's arms with enough force that Rio wobbled a bit on the balls of her feet, though she managed to plant again as she hugged Stevie tightly.</p><p>The moment Stevie pulled away, her hands landed on Rio's shoulders and Agatha watched as their gazes locked, the processing beginning to wind through Stevie's features.</p><p>"Ms. Nikki said that she doesn't have to come back for a long time," Stevie told Rio, as if she were not aware. Agatha could feel the stinging as it snuck toward the backs of her eyes but she combatted it with only a few blinks. "She said I get to sleep here every night and I don't have to leave."</p><p>Rio raised a cautious hand and when Stevie glanced at it, her head turned toward it just the slightest bit. Agatha sucked in a breath as Rio reached forward and brushed Stevie's cheek softly with her thumb. </p><p>"She's right. You're going to live with us now." The affirmation was so unbearably warm as it let Rio's lips and it was visible in her entire form that she meant every single word. "You can sleep in the Bluey room every night. We can make dinner together some nights and we can order your favorites on others. We can watch movies and cartoons. Do you think you might like doing that with myself and Mrs. Agatha while you get older?"</p><p>As Stevie listened to Rio, completely rapt, Agatha could see the emotion welling in her small form. The processing was happening, the digesting of information she was being given so that she could break it down and integrate it into what she knew. It was a process for anyone, but for someone as young as Stevie, it was probably a bit more of a struggle. She was being told, outright, that her life was changing. </p><p>"How old?" Stevie finally asked, though she had not lifted her hands from Rio's shoulders.</p><p>Agatha watched, nearly breathless in her observation of the moment as Rio's lips pressed in thought, as if she were doing the math. "At least the next thirteen years," she informed her once she had decided upon the answer.</p><p>"Thirteen?!" Stevie gasped, mouth agape at such an astounding answer. "That's way more than I am!"</p><p>"It is," Agatha offered, breaking the awestricken silence that had gripped her since the moment the door had opened. "But... We would like to spend that long with <em>you."</em></p><p>Stevie's beautiful grey eyes lifted to take in Agatha, studying her for only a moment before those small hands pulled from Rio's shoulders and she wound her way around Rio's knee to make her way over to Agatha. Her head tipped back as their eyes locked and Stevie grinned again.</p><p>"I like that, Mrs. Agatha," Stevie told her. She did not move, did not depart from her spot in front of Agatha. What she did instead was raise her arms up in what was becoming a familiar gesture. It was a silent request of a youthful mind for physical comfort that she had likely been starved of for most of her life. </p><p>The very second Agatha bent at the waist to lift Stevie into her arms, she had a thought: there would never be another moment in Stevie's life where she had to want for attention or affection, so long as Agatha and Rio had anything to say about it. Never again would she ever close her eyes at night with any drop of fear to be found within herself. Not once more would Stevie ever know what it meant to be unloved.</p><p>At the feeling of those thin arms around her neck, Agatha cradled the back of Stevie's head, tucking her chin over Stevie's shoulder as she squeezed her eyes shut in a valiant attempt to push the deep welling of emotion inside of her out of her main scope of focus. All that mattered to them in those moments was right there in Agatha's arms.</p><p>As her blue eyes dared to open, Agatha could see from over Stevie's form as Nicole offered a hand to Rio who pushed it aside, stepping in for a warm hug instead. Agatha surely owed Nicole one as well, but for the time being she had her arms full of half of the whole of what Agatha's future would ever be. The other half was mere feet away, offering appreciation and gratitude to someone who had fought for them, who would surely offer any input she could when it came to getting the adoption finalized. </p><p>Stevie finally pulled back and looked down her nose just barely at Agatha, that infectious smile filling her face as she reached up to trace her fingers along the frame of Agatha's glasses. That grey gaze followed her touch intently before it dropped down and Agatha felt as though the little girl in her arms was staring straight into every cavern of her soul. Stevie was seeing everything she needed to see in that moment, reading it for herself.</p><p>"Do we get to make dinner tonight?" came Stevie's soft inquiry as she rubbed the gold chain around Agatha's neck between her fingers mindlessly.</p><p>"We can if you want," Agatha supplied in response, but she leaned over to set Stevie back on the ground. "But we should get you settled first. Then we can decide what to make. Is that fair?"</p><p>All three women were focused on Stevie, none of them sure what her reaction to all of this might end up being. Sure, Stevie had told Nicole the night before that she wanted to stay forever, but did she understand what that meant, in its essence? She was so young, but Agatha knew that didn't make her dull in the slightest. In fact, in the time they'd spent together, Agatha had garnered that Stevie was rather smart given her age. That, Agatha was sure, had probably come from a place of constant watching, studying, assessing. </p><p>That grey gaze flickered to the kitchen for a moment and Stevie's lips worried together slightly in consideration. The kitchen was quickly becoming her safe place, and Agatha could understand it, but there did have to be some order under their roof and there were things that needed tending to first. Stevie turned her attention back as she looked up at Rio, not quite asking for a different answer but rather confirmation of the one she had already been given.</p><p>"We'll be quick, okay? How about we say our goodbyes to Nicole so that we can let her get on about her day, then we can go put your things away in your room?" The offer Rio presented was a reasonable one and it only seemed to take Stevie a moment to decide that it was worth taking. </p><p>Stevie took the few steps over toward Nicole, tilting her head to look up at the woman who had been her advocate since the moment Stevie's case had come across her desk only days before she had entered into the lives of the Vidals. She had made sure that Stevie was taken care of in the time it took to get her exactly where she needed to go. Maybe Stevie never could have known it in so many words, but it was clear in her expression that she was thankful for Nicole, just as the two older women were.</p><p>Nicole was the one this time to level herself with Stevie, meeting her eye-to-eye across the small space between them.</p><p>"This is goodbye for now," Nicole told her in a low voice that conveyed to Agatha more than it did to Stevie how much she was actually the one dreading this. "I will check in to make sure you're doing okay... But I think you're really going to like it here. So... If you ever need me, you let them know and they'll call me up, okay?"</p><p>"Okay, Ms. Nikki," Stevie affirmed with a strong nod of her head. "Bye for now."</p><p>With a tight but genuine smile, Nicole pushed off of her own knees to rise to full height, her hazel gaze sweeping from Rio to Agatha. "Congratulations, ladies. The next six months or so still lie ahead, but you get to do it together. And I wish you all the luck in the world."</p><p>It was Agatha who stepped forward this time, wrapping Nicole up in a firm hug. She held it for a moment longer than she should have in her show of appreciation, that same emotion written on her face as she released her hold.</p><p>"Thank you, Nicole. Truly. You will never know how deep our gratitude for you runs. Please, be safe on your way home. We'll hear from you in a few weeks?" The sweetness of Agatha's tone never once wavered and the warmth in her features seemed paramount.</p><p>"A few weeks. Likely just a phone call, but I'll shoot you a text if anything changes." Even though her voice was strong, Agatha could see that look in her eyes. Nicole knew she had to leave, but this case had clung to her a little more. "I hope the three of you have the most amazing night. See you!" she offered before the made her quick exit as the three of them lowered their hands from waving goodbye.</p><p>It would have helped to have stood in the moment, to let it all sink in, but that was in no way practical. Instead, Agatha moved into action by reaching down to grab up the small duffel bag that Nicole had left on the floor for them, full of what few things Stevie owned. She slung the rough fabric strap over her shoulder at the same time Stevie realized what was happening.</p><p>"Does that go in the Bluey room?" her timid question came, though her eyes had landed on Rio.</p><p>"It does. We have some clothes for you up there already, but we want you to have stuff you're used to, too." The way Rio spoke to Stevie, the way she looked at her? It was something Agatha had gotten glimpses over the time they had gotten to spend together, but in that moment, it felt like something brand new. </p><p>It felt like Rio had dropped into a state of being that Agatha had never seen before, mostly because she was certain Rio had never needed such a mind frame.</p><p>It felt like Rio was realizing she had her foot in the door of actually becoming a parent.</p><p>There were far too many complexities of what they were going through, Agatha knew, for either of them to jump to immediate conclusions. They would absolutely be parental figures to Stevie, but everything felt just a little too precarious to be letting themselves claim the <em>title</em> of being her parents. Agatha's personal take on it was that doing such a thing would not feel safe until a judge gave word and everything was legalized.</p><p>This was new for both of them and, as Agatha was quick to assert when Rio's doubt seemed to creep in, they were navigating it all to the best of their abilities based on the road map they had been provided. It would lead them to their destination, without question, but there were turns they had to take and checkpoints they had to pass through. The most important part now was that they did not slow down, that they kept going until they got there.</p><p>"Shall we?" Agatha asked, waving a gentle hand toward the stairs. </p><p>Stevie's eyes cut over to the staircase and then back to Agatha. The moment their gazes locked? Stevie grinned again and Agatha was acutely aware of the stumbling her heart did over its beats in her chest. In the blink of an eye, Stevie took off and headed for the stairs, giggling all the way. Agatha looked across the couple of feet of space between them at Rio for the briefest moment. Rio's instant smile was softened, but her joy was still there. Agatha's own was wide and toothy, loud in her own jubilation.</p><p>As quick as the moment had come, it was gone and they were both moving toward the stairs that Stevie was already part way up, swinging by the banister on the landing to head up to the second floor. They had almost caught up to her by the time she reached the third story, close enough that they could see her blitz down the hall straight into her room, her laughter spilling out of her all the while.</p><p>Agatha turned into the doorway first, met with the sight of the little girl -- <em>their little girl,</em> even if just for now<em> </em>-- on her stomach in the spot on the bed where she had landed when she jumped onto it. In her grasp was one of the plushies, the Bingo one, as she stared at it. </p><p><em>"I missed you, Bingo," </em>Stevie told it softly before she hugged it tightly to the available portion of her chest that was not pressed to the bed.</p><p>Agatha felt as Rio shuffled in behind her, placing a firm hand on her far shoulder as she passed by, giving it a supportive squeeze before she removed the touch so she could take the bag from Agatha and continue toward the dresser. </p><p>"Do you want to help me put your things away?" Rio asked her softly.</p><p>While overwhelmed with sheer emotion, Agatha was doing an incredible job of holding it together. She was in a strange suspension of understanding. Nicky had been just younger than Stevie was now when she had lost him. Yet, there Stevie was as she clamored off of the bed to meet Rio's side, merely months older. It felt like the universe had simply initiated a pause in her motherhood, one that had lasted over fifteen years. Agatha didn't know exactly how she was supposed to feel upon understanding that piece of information.</p><p>Stevie was not Nicky, and Agatha knew that. But, Nicky had taught Agatha how to be a mother. Now, Stevie was going to reap the benefits of that, even if Agatha knew there would surely still be missteps a long the way.</p><p>As she stood just inside that doorway, watching her wife and Stevie pull things out of her bag and put them into the empty drawers, it was a vision of a reality Agatha never knew she could have. </p><p>It had been over six months, almost seven, since that awful November day that had left Agatha physically and mentally in tatters. In that time, she'd fallen hopelessly in love with the most incredible woman the world had even known, they'd gotten married, and there they were with a little girl they were so desperate to call their daughter. Maybe, Agatha thought, it was going to be a little easier to do that even with the delicate balancing act of legalization still pulled taut in front of them.</p><p>Nicole had been firm in her assertion that, barring any major incidents, it could be considerably close to a done deal with that placement, but at the same time Agatha could not rid herself of the smallest sliver of doubt that was nestled too comfortably in the back of her mind: <em>What if something went wrong?</em></p><p>It was the main thing that forced her reserves but the truth? The truth was that she was going to get attached, and very quickly. Hadn't she already? Hadn't they both? Stevie was a magnetic force and she had pulled the both of them directly to her. There was no struggle to separate now because they didn't have to. She was home, where she belonged. It just needed to stay that way.</p><p>In their task, Rio had pulled out a purple dress that had Bluey on the front of it and a delighted squeal came from Stevie's lips.</p><p>"That's my favorite one, Dr. Rio!" Stevie informed her, so animated in her delivery.</p><p>"Well, we can definitely hang it up and put it in the closet, then." Rio's gaze lifted and met Agatha's across the room, her request sweet. "Can you grab a hanger from our closet?" </p><p>"Of course," Agatha returned with a smile. </p><p>Given the circumstances, the only thing that Agatha really felt as she floated down the hallway to their bedroom was complete bliss. She wasn't thinking about how it could be short lived, or that she could be putting the cart before the horse. She was just thinking about how her wife and their little girl were in there making her feel a little more at home.</p><p>Agatha blew into the closet on a non-existent breeze and turned to her side of it, starting toward where the loose hangers were.</p><p>When she was about two steps away, something caught her eye.</p><p>It was a carboard box. A very, very old cardboard box.</p><p>Instantly, that bliss dissolved and dissipated out of Agatha's form and an anvil of anxiety lodged itself somewhere in the middle of her throat. </p><p>She hadn't thought about that box in a very long time. In fact, she had not even thought about that box in the move. </p><p>Agatha was not the one who had stowed that box there. </p><p>Rio had.</p><p>That fact alone was nearly enough to bring Agatha directly to her knees.</p><p>After only another moment of sputtering to catch her breath, that was exactly where she fell. The tears, however, did not pour.</p><p>Instead, a trembling hand extended forward and applied pressure to the top of one corner, using it to direct the box to slide smoothly over the carpeted floor, closer to her so that she could somehow find the will to open it.</p><p>Agatha's teeth clenched and her jaw bulged from the effort; they were pressed so tightly it almost started to hurt. She had to do this. She had to open that box. She had to see what was inside to remember what once was, but to also understand that more lay ahead. </p><p>Agatha had to let go.</p><p>With shaky fingers, she pulled the flaps back using both hands. The contents were what finally caused the tears.</p><p>Inside was a plethora of Nicky's things. There were a couple of toy cars -- only his favorites -- and dump trucks, a few books, some photos and a string and bead necklace he had made for her at preschool. The most noticeable thing, though, was the soft white and brown stuffed rabbit that sat near the bottom of the box.</p><p>With a few steadying breaths, Agatha blinked back the flow of saline and reached in to remove the rabbit. She stared at it for a long moment, thinking about the last time she had placed it in Nicky's lap and how much he had loved it, how much comfort he had found in it. After a beat, she pulled it close, hugging it to her chest.</p><p>Those items were the building blocks to the child she had lost. What if they could be the reinforcement needed to help Stevie build herself bigger and better as she grew older, instead?</p><p>Agatha's head dipped, her chin tucking nearly to her chest as she pressed her mouth and nose to still somehow velvety fur of the stuffed animal. </p><p>It was time. </p><p>It was time to push the painful memories of her past into a new light, into an illumination of what could be something equally as beautiful, but now present.</p><p>In her self-reflection, she was trying to find strength, resolve. She was trying to remember that everything in her life, losing Nicky included, had landed her right in that moment, exactly where she needed to be. In the midst of those thoughts, her present and her future came calling.</p><p>"Mrs. Agatha! Where did you go?!" came Stevie's high-pitched tones from down the hall.</p><p>It felt like Agatha was launched from a trebuchet and hurled right back into the moment, into her reality. Still clutching Señor Scratchy to her chest with one hand, she brought the other up to wipe at her damp cheeks and took a breath so deep that if she tried to consume more oxygen, she was sure her lungs would burst. </p><p>Only one more moment passed before Agatha pushed herself to her feet and reached up to slide a hanger off of the pole. After she secured it, she gently laid the rabbit on top of the rest of the contents of the box and closed it right before she pulled it into her arms and made her journey back to Stevie's room.</p><p>When she appeared in the doorway, Rio's eyes dropped to what was in her hands and those soft and full lips turned down at the corners, a slight flash of panic happening across those dark pools. Agatha offered a tight but slightly nervous smile in return, but the way her throat bobbed with the force of her swallowing surely gave her away.</p><p>"What is that, Mrs. Agatha?" Stevie asked, her tone lightly inquisitorial.</p><p>"This," Agatha indicated as she stepped forward and leaned over to set the box down on the floor, "is a box full of things that used to belong to someone very special to me. He hasn't needed them for a very long time, and I think he would be very happy if you wanted any of them." She did not straighten back up and instead lowered herself to the floor, folding her legs beneath her as she reached forward to open the box again.</p><p>Stevie was quick to plant herself on the other side of that box, sitting the same way with her legs crossed, her eyes wide and interested. Another second passed and Rio was just behind Stevie, though her legs were spread out in front of her as she leaned back on her hands, simply observing the moment.</p><p>The very moment the box opened, Stevie's eyes fell to the top item and she released an ecstatic cry and she reached out to scoop the rabbit into her arms, holding it up for a moment to inspect it. For being as old as it was, it was still in good shape. It had been put into that box and pushed to the back of Agatha's closet in the townhome. Then, Rio had brought it, maybe even unknowingly, to Agatha's new home. And now, the true home it would find was right there, holding it, looking at it like it was a shining star in a night sky.</p><p>Slowly, Stevie's eyes raised to Agatha and her inquiry was cautious but the slight edge of excitement coated her words.</p><p>"Does he have a name?" she questioned and Agatha nodded. </p><p>"His name is Señor Scratchy. He is a very good guard rabbit." The words were actually stronger than Agatha had thought they might be, and judging by the look on Rio's face, she was having the same thoughts. Rio had known what was in that box, she had to. Rio had probably also not expected for this to be the exact moment that not only had Agatha found it, but made the decision to relinquish her hold on the physical memories of her son.</p><p>Stevie considered this for a moment, looking back at the stuffed animal in her hands. </p><p>"I like him. I can have him?" she asked, though it took her a beat longer to meet Agatha's gaze again.</p><p>All she found there was fondness and affection. </p><p>"You can. In fact, you can have anything in this box that you want." The words were shaky, but Agatha managed them all the same. She had braved a glance at Rio and almost regretted it in the same instant. </p><p>Rio looked like <em>she</em> was going to cry. She was managing to keep the actual action subdued, but that look in her eyes was a dead giveaway. Agatha gave the slightest shake of her head and looked back down to Stevie as she set Señor Scratchy in her lap and leaned forward to look inside of the box.</p><p>Agatha let her root through it, pulling out a couple of things she liked -- including a couple of the cars, but only because they were purple -- and then turned her attention to the books. Almost as if willed by the universe, that pink bound book came out in her grasp and yet again, Agatha was nearly choked with emotion.</p><p>"What's this one say?" Stevie probed, looking down at it as she ran tiny fingertips over the cover, touching the green men on the front with their big and round noses.</p><p>"It's called 'The Doozer Who Didn't,'" Agatha informed. "It's about a little guy who stopped doing what he should and just... Didn't."</p><p>Stevie opened the pages in interest and Agatha could feel her heart squeeze in her chest. Her head lifted again, zeroing in on Agatha's emotional gaze.</p><p>"Will you read this to me Mrs. Agatha?" </p><p>Agatha gave the slightest nod of her head, a soft but pained smile coming to her lips.</p><p>"I would love nothing more. But... Let's save it for bed time, okay?"</p><p>This seemed to be an adequate answer as Stevie looked back down at it and gave a shrug. </p><p>"Okay," she agreed simply just before she closed the book.</p><p>She mulled over the remaining books and a few more of the toys, making her selections of what she wanted to keep and leaving alone the things that did not pique her interest. Agatha took no offense to any of it, but she also knew what that meant. Disposing of them was not an option, but donating them could be. They were still perfectly good toys and if Stevie got what she wanted and needed from it, the rest could go to help another child. That was what Nicky would have wanted.</p><p>Agatha had always hated it when people had used that phrase. She hated it when the few friends she'd had at the time told her he would have wanted her to process her grief, to move on, to learn to be happy again. She had lashed out, asked them how they would have known what a five-year-old would have wanted in terms of her well-being. She had been so, so angry.</p><p>Now, Agatha had full faith that if she had asked a five-year-old Nicky what she should do with his toys if he hadn't needed them anymore, she could say with confidence that he would have told her to let someone else enjoy them. It wouldn't have been so eloquently put, but she had known her son enough to be sure of that much.</p><p>They had finished sorting through the contents of the box and Agatha had been quick in her mission to return it -- now half as full -- to her side of the closet until she could find the right place to donate them to.</p><p>Returning to the doorway to collect the two of them for dinner, Agatha let herself stop to wait, to watch. Rio removed the last item from Stevie's bag -- a fleece blanket that had wolves on it and looked so impossibly soft even from where Agatha was on the other side of the room. Rio shook it out and laid it across the comforter on the little twin sized bed.</p><p>"There we go. Now you've got your pack to protect you, too. They can provide Señor Scratchy any needed support." </p><p>Although it had never been an in-depth discussion, Agatha had known Rio was nervous. She'd been carrying on rather well, acting like she was simply going with the flow, but Agatha had knowledge Rio didn't. She had mentioned a couple of times that she'd spent time with Julia's nephew and that he was a good kid, but Rio didn't know what it was to be a parent. It wasn't her fault, it had simply never been in the cards for her, and that was okay. </p><p>What Rio was doing now? She was stepping up to the plate, bat in hand, not giving two shits that someone had just maced her and she couldn't see what the fuck she was doing. She was trusting her senses, trusting her instincts to completely knock it out of the park. If she caught a strike or two in the process? It was nothing they couldn't recover from. Rio would just plant her feet, square her shoulders and swing with all her might.</p><p>With that kind of determination, a grand slam was imminent.</p><p>They had both noticed her in the doorway at almost the exact same time; the way both pairs of eyes landed on her sent her bubbling over with warmth, with love. Stevie had wasted no time in suggesting that she was hungry and while Agatha did not doubt that she was telling the truth, she also noted it as Stevie's way of indicating where she wanted to be and what she needed. It was hard not to discern as much after the interaction earlier near the foyer.</p><p>So, the three of them had ventured down to the kitchen where Agatha had held the door to the refrigerator open so that Stevie could survey what was inside. A good long few moments passed before Stevie had turned her head, tipping it back to look up at Agatha. Her question was short and to the point.</p><p>"Do you have mashed potatoes, Mrs. Agatha?"</p><p>Agatha was actually stunned, for some reason. It wasn't an abnormal request, but the bluntness of it caught her off guard along with how steeled Stevie's expression was. Agatha wanted to laugh. In fact, she <em>almost</em> did. And then she realized that if she did, it would leave Stevie incredibly confused and they didn't need to start things off on a bad foot.</p><p>"We don't have already mashed potatoes," Rio called over her shoulder as she disappeared into the pantry. "But! We have unmashed potatoes that we can mash ourselves," she added as she resurfaced in the kitchen, clutching a mesh bag filled with potatoes. She held it up with a grin like she'd just caught a prize fish on a summer day as she approached and set it on the counter.</p><p>Stevie glanced up at them for just a moment, and then shifted her focus to the potatoes. Then, her gaze went back in question as she half lifted a hand, as if she wanted to reach out and touch. Agatha simply answered by giving her a gentle nod. Stevie looked back up at the sack of potatoes on the counter and reached up, poking at one through the mesh.</p><p>"It's hard!" she observed in a giggle. "Like a rock! How do you mash a rock?"</p><p>"Well, you take the skins off and cut them up into pieces," Agatha explained as she reached forward to begin the process of removing enough potatoes to suitable feed each of them. When she was satifistied, she cinched the top and handed it back to Rio who was quick as she returned the remainder of the bag to where she had found it in the pantry. "And then we put them in really <em>really</em> hot water until they get soft. After that, we drain off all the water -- which Dr. Rio or I will always do -- and then we put the soft potatoes in the bowl and mash them all up."</p><p>Rio reappeared on the other side of Stevie, a chair clutched in her hand that she placed sideways next to Agatha so that Stevie could climb up to kneel and watch. She understood the opportunity and was quick in her ascent to the seat of the chair, knees planted firmly as she watched from her spot as Agatha began preparing what Stevie had asked for.</p><p>Stevie would ask her questions -- like how Agatha got so good at peeling potatoes, or why  the pieces she cut were all the same size -- and Agatha had answered every one of them honestly. Once her curiosity had been satisfied, she simply watched. Her eyes followed Rio to the refrigerator as she pulled out cheese and butter, both of which Stevie had requested. Stevie had even let out a delighted hum when Rio had also pulled out the bag of nuggets. She studied Agatha as she floated around the kitchen, making light work of prepping the potatoes.</p><p>The joy that had been obvious as Stevie clutched the handle of the masher, laughing maniacally every time she sunk it down into the softened potatoes, was nearly tangible and hung in the air around them, thick and serene. It was inviting. It was comforting. It was peaceful.</p><p>That dinner was just another dinner to Stevie, as they sat around that table eating their mashed potatoes that she swore were the 'best ever.' </p><p>For Agatha and Rio?</p><p>That dinner was their very first within the parameters of them being a family, an actual family.</p><p>The rest of the night had felt similar to the weekend they'd just spent together, but there was something different about it. Maybe Stevie did not understand her current situation to its fullest extent, but she got it enough to let herself start to feel comfortable. She was still polite and still frequently asked for most things, but there were other times where she did what she wanted to do. It was in the way she walked over to the small basket of toys after their meal and busied herself by playing with them.</p><p>It was even in the way that when she was done, she got to her feet and made her way to the couch, wedging herself in the space between their thighs even though she was a little too big to fit. They of course obliged her, scooting outward so she settled easily between them.</p><p>When Stevie had made her announcement this time, that she was tired, it was a little easier to get her upstairs and into bed than it had been Saturday night. Rio had been the first to tuck her in and position a couple of her stuffed animals so they were close enough for comfort. Agatha watched with a tender heart as Rio ruffled Stevie's hair and told her goodnight.</p><p>When Agatha approached, though, Stevie already had a question in those eyes the moment she looked up.</p><p>"Mrs. Agatha, will you read me the 'Didn't' book?"</p><p>It was almost... scared. Like she was afraid to be told no, like she was looking for something that she would be crushed if she did not get.</p><p>"Of course, sweetie."</p><p>It had come so easily because it was <em>that easy.</em> If that was what Stevie wanted, that was what she was going to get. Agatha placed herself in the gliding rocker and cracked open the book as she began to read Stevie the tale of the Doozer Who Didn't.</p><p>With about four pages left, Agatha glanced over to see Stevie sound asleep, Señor Scratchy held tightly to her chest. For just a moment, Agatha let the emotion touch her face. Rio had disappeared, likely to their bedroom, and so... She let herself just <em>feel it</em> for that moment and that moment only.</p><p>Then, she got to her feet and carried herself to change her clothes and climb into that big bed with her wife. She hadn't possessed the intention to cry, but the moment Rio started, it had been difficult to keep her own dam walls up.</p><p>They weren't sad tears. They were tears of relief, tears of raw emotion, tears of realization. </p><p>They were tears of accomplishment.</p><p>Falling asleep that first night had been monumental as the cap on the day they'd had, but somehow that feeling never went away in the nights that followed.</p><p>Things had, for the most part, been manageable over the first few weeks. There had been the occasional tantrum over being told no but Stevie would stomp up the stairs to her room where she seemed to take the time she needed to calm down, something she and Rio had taken to referring to as 'finding her peace.' A short while later, she would make her reappearance as if nothing was wrong, having completely moved on from the original source of strife.</p><p>When those things happened, the two of them would let a little time pass before they had a gentle and brief conversation with Stevie about why she had been denied what she had been asking for and while it was okay have valid feelings about it, it was not okay to act out. It had started to sink in and they were able to begin the <em>slowest</em> dialogue with her and talking about her feelings. It finally started to work.</p><p>Until it didn't.</p><p>The first couple of grocery runs, Agatha had taken on by herself. She had done this for a couple of reasons: 1) Agatha had noticed that more often than not, Stevie was pulled to her and asked more of her. 2) Rio needed the bonding time. Agatha had spent hours alone in that hospital room with Stevie, hours that Rio had needed to be other places because of her job. 3) They were both a bit nervous about the idea of taking Stevie to the grocery store. It was an absolute minefield of wants and rejections and with things still being so fresh, it was anyone's guess how it might play out.</p><p>Almost three weeks in, Rio had approached Agatha with the idea of making their first trip as a unit to the store. She had been in the middle of brushing her teeth before bed and she was certain it was the very reason Rio had asked, to force her to take the time to really think about it. She spit and then rinsed her mouth before she turned and paced back into the bedroom.</p><p>"I..." Agatha pressed her lips together as she slid on the bed, turning her head to look over at her wife. "I know we have to. And I know it should be sooner rather than later so that we have an opportunity to identify behaviors that we can then correct but... I'm just nervous."</p><p>Rio reached out, pulling Agatha into her side. Agatha let her head rest on Rio's shoulder, a soft sigh passing through her lips at the feeling of a soft kiss against her hairline.</p><p>"I know you are, my love. But you're also right. We can't keep putting it off and it would benefit us to look at it as a learning opportunity above all else." How was it that even before the chaos of the storm, Rio had at least the beginnings of a weather plan? Maybe she had no clue how they might actually handle it, but it seemed as though Rio had an absolutely unshakable faith in the fact that they could.</p><p>Rio also had an uncanny ability of capturing Agatha's logic mid-air and turning it around to show her exactly what she needed to see in what she had been trying to toss away.</p><p>It was annoying in the way it had been annoying the day they'd met for the second time. </p><p>But it was also what made Agatha love her so damn much.</p><p>So that Saturday, Rio had buckled Stevie into her booster seat, double checking the belt was secure before she climbed into the passenger's seat. A whispered piece of advice hit Agatha's ears as they fastened their own seatbelts almost in unison.</p><p>
<em>"Watch your language."</em>
</p><p>A smirk immediately curled Agatha's lips, though she rolled her eyes at the same time. It might have seemed like a dismissal, but she understood it. They were trying to impart good habits and respectful language. They were trying to teach positive lessons in coping with loud emotions. That meant that Agatha needed to control her road rage, at least when Stevie was in the car.</p><p><em>"Yes, honey," </em>she shot back in a low grumble. </p><p>Very quickly, they learned that music with vocals was not Stevie's favorite. She had not offered protest, but Agatha had caught sight of her in the mirror with her hands clasped over her ears. Immediately, she reached forward to turn it down, even if it hadn't been that loud to begin with. She glanced over her shoulder for a brief moment to do a quick gauge, but Stevie was already pulling her hands down.</p><p>"Stevie, baby, do you not like the music?" Agatha asked her softly though she didn't risk looking behind her again, instead lifting her gaze to the mirror for a brief glance. She was realizing in that moment that in the times of dropping her off at school, they'd never turned it on.</p><p>"I like music, but not the shouting," she explained as though it should have been completely obvious.</p><p>Rio had a solution for this. She pulled up her playlists and scrolled down a bit, finally finding the one she was looking for. The moment she put it on, Agatha recognized it as Rio's lo-fi playlist. They were remastered versions of classics arranged in a way that could often soothe or provide a mellow symphony that could offer a semblance of calm.</p><p>It pacified Stevie almost immediately.</p><p>Her head turned and her eyes studied the world outside as it passed by. After just a moment, she began to rock slightly in place, but judging by her expression it was likely an automatic function. Agatha had noticed on a couple of other instances, the way Stevie seemed to self-soothe with such a motion. It never lasted long, but it always seemed to happen whenever she was under any kind of stress or when she was upset.</p><p><em>"Good call," </em>Agatha offered quietly, just soft enough to slide over to Rio beneath the music.</p><p>In a quick gesture, Rio's hand sailed over the center console and landed on Agatha's thigh, giving it an thankful squeeze. Almost as quick as the contact had come, it was gone. </p><p>After only a few more minutes, Agatha pulled into a parking spot and cut the engine just before removing the keys from the ignition. Her lips pressed as she stared directly ahead. Did they preface this with a conversation? Did they just jump headlong into it and play it by ear? The questions were bouncing around, but she was jolted from thought as Rio spoke first.</p><p>"We are gonna be as quick as we can, okay?" she voiced, twisting around in her seat so she could look back at Stevie who met Rio's gaze.</p><p>"I'm not allowed to go to the store," Stevie informed her and even though Agatha wasn't looking back, her face fell anyway.</p><p>"Yes you are," Rio assured her with haste. "With us, you are. We are going to run in and grab what we need then we can go back home and spend some time in the backyard. The vegetables we planted the other day could probably use some water. So let's do this first, then we can take care of our plants. How does that sound?" The way Rio spoke had always been so enchanting to Agatha, but as Agatha's blue eyes lifted and took in the sight of Stevie in the mirror? It appeared as though she felt the same way. She was listening, understanding.</p><p>Her little brow pinched slightly above her nose, fighting herself on accepting such a response. Another second passed and it smoothed itself out once more.</p><p>"Okay, Dr. Rio."</p><p>It was an offer of peace for the time being, but it hadn't lasted long.</p><p>Stevie was a kid. They were both aware of that, and even though Agatha had a better understanding of what that entailed, there were still some things that she could not prepare for.</p><p>One of those things was the absolute blood-curdling shriek that leapt from Stevie's lungs at Agatha's assertion that she could not have the bag of Reese cups she wanted because they had plenty of them back home. </p><p>The sound had sent a bolt of ice up Agatha's spine and she was already flying into crisis mode to figure out how to cope with it. The gears began to turn as quick as she could get them to, but before much came in terms of an answer, Rio was already snapping into action.</p><p>In a fluid motion, Rio stepped to stand before Stevie and she she dropped to the ground, crossing her legs beneath her as she reached up to gingerly take hold of both of Stevie's hands, who was still offering loud sobs of indignance into the air.</p><p><em>"Hey, Stevie. Look at me, please?"  </em>Rio asked her. Agatha was watching from behind Rio, having moved out of the way so other people could pass by if they needed. Rio didn't care, though. She didn't waver even an inch. Stevie was still crying, but the noises were getting softer as her eyes dropped to Rio.</p><p>
<em>"I know you're angry, but... What if we make a deal? You don't need a whole bag of them, but what if we grab you one when we pay for everything?"</em>
</p><p>The tears were still pouring down Stevie's cheeks and her tiny chest was continuously heaving with the effort of her distress. Agatha knew that to anyone else, it was just a child's tantrum at not getting their way. It very well could have been just that, but Agatha could see the subwaves as they bounced beneath the surface.</p><p>Stevie had seen something that offered her comfort in a time where Agatha had sensed she was anxious. Stevie had said it herself. This was something she wasn't allowed to do under the previously normal circumstances. The fact that she was acting out? Even if it didn't actually have a deeper meaning, it was still just a part of being a kid. Not every reaction could be measured and planned for.</p><p>Did planning really matter though, when Rio was in the picture?</p><p>Agatha's eyes stung as she just watched. She didn't need to see Rio to picture exactly what expression she was wearing and she could tell from the view just over Rio's shoulders that her thumbs were brushing soothingly over the backs of Stevie's hands. The longer she repeated the gesture, the more it seemed to subdue the upset child. </p><p><em>"Can I eat it in the car?"</em> Stevie asked in the smallest voice Agatha was sure she had ever heard her use. </p><p>Ah, a small victory.</p><p>Agatha was amazed, really. Rio had surely contained her nerves about all of this to the best of her abilities, but Agatha had been aware of them nonetheless. Right then? Right then, Agatha wished that for just thirty seconds, she and Rio could be alone so that she could tell her wife just how incredible her instincts were and how there would be no need for doubt moving forward if Rio could trust her gut the same way she had in those moments. </p><p><em>"You can absolutely eat it in the car. We have some more stuff to get, but I promise we'll get one when we leave." </em>Rio's voice was smooth and rich, low in tone but the physical volume paled in comparison to the loudness of her words. </p><p>Stevie's chest was still rising and falling a little too quickly, but she managed her question through her labored breathing.</p><p><em>"Pinky promise?" </em>she squeaked and Agatha could see it clearly as Rio's posture nearly dissolved. She let go of Stevie's hands and held up one of her own, all fingers down except for her pinky.</p><p><em>"Pinky promise." </em>Instantly, Stevie reached up to link their pinkies together, though she seemed to still be struggling to steady herself. </p><p>Rio didn't let go. Instead, her shoulders lifted and shook the slightest bit. </p><p>"Can you breathe with me? I'm gonna count for us, okay? I'm gonna count to four each time. When we take a big breath, it'll be for four. Then, we're gonna hold our breath and I'll count to four again. When I'm done, we're gonna let that breath go for four more. We'll hold our breaths for four one more time and then we'll start over. Can you do that with me?"</p><p>With the slightest trace of uncertainty, Stevie nodded her head.</p><p>Rio held up the hand that wasn't linked with Stevie's and gave a nod. "In," she instructed, taking a breath as she popped up one finger after another until she got to four. "Now hold it in," she continued, another raising of four digits as Stevie complied. "Out." Rio repeated the gesture once more as Stevie's chest deflated. "Hold one more time." </p><p>They repeated that process several times, as Agatha was all too familiar with, and she simply stood there, rooted in her awe as the tears began to slow in their descent down Stevie's cheeks. It had been at least ten minutes since the ordeal started by the time she seemed to reach the point of calm that would be needed to continue the rest of their trip. </p><p>Rio got to her feet and Stevie immediately reached for her hand this time, instead of opting to roam on her own. Rio was close enough, though, that Agatha was able to deliver a soft sentiment that was not quite loud enough to travel down and reach Stevie's ears.</p><p><em>"I don't think you need to worry as much as you have been. You did exactly what I would have done, if not better. So... good job." </em>Agatha's lips curled up at the corners in a smile that conveyed her sincerity. </p><p>The expression Rio had to offer in return almost broke something in Agatha. It wasn't just gratitude. It was relief.</p><p><em>"Thank you. I needed that." </em>Her whispered response tugged at something deep in Agatha's chest, tugging even harder the moment Rio leaned in to give her a soft kiss. The unspoken 'I love you,' was clear as day in those dark eyes.</p><p>They'd ventured forth, Rio and Stevie leading hand-in-hand as they wound their way up and down the aisles. Rio would see something that wasn't necessarily on the list but that she thought Stevie might like and would point in question. Some of the time, Stevie would decline. Other times, like when Rio had pulled down the box of Bluey fruit snacks, Stevie would begin to get overexcited but then center herself, nodding eagerly instead.</p><p>Every interaction, every instance that Agatha was bearing witness to was the first step. Rio was too smart for her own good sometimes. What she was doing was actually the best thing she could have chosen to do. They had told Stevie no and asserted it, but that didn't mean she could not have <em>anything</em> that she was wanting, just not that specific thing. So Rio was bartering with her, even in a subconscious manner, and it was working.</p><p>By the time they had loaded everything into the car and headed back home, Stevie's head had dropped back and her eyes had fallen shut. The unopened package of Resee's was still clutched tightly in her thin fingers.</p><p>Agatha got it. Emotions were hard. They could be exhausting. </p><p>Maybe to anyone else in that store, she had been nothing more than a petulant child throwing a temper tantrum. Surely they had judged, formed their own opinions.</p><p>What Agatha had witnessed? It was a child who's life had been changed dramatically within the last month who was struggling to cope with feelings she didn't quite understand. It was also a woman who's compassion ran so deep within her that Agatha was sure her marrow was nothing <em>but</em> that compassion. </p><p>Agatha had watched as a woman who had no idea how to be a mother placed herself directly in the role of being a mother without thinking twice. She had done it out of nothing but love, nothing but caring in her heart. As Rio often did, she saw someone she loved hurting -- even if Stevie would not be able to articulate that kind of ache for a long while -- and she had jumped into action.</p><p>Rio provided results in any facet that pertained to emotional soothing. Always.</p><p><em>"I know you don't talk about it," </em>Agatha murmured as she pulled up a bit into the intersection to make a left turn, <em>"but I know you've been nervous. And... I understand it. However, I think it's because you've assumed I have a leg up here. And maybe I do in some ways..." </em>Agatha paused, pressing her lips tight for a moment as she considered what she wanted to say next, or at least the best way to say it. <em>"But you, my love, know nothing <b>but</b> love. You've made your mistakes, as we all have, and maybe you unintentionally hurt others in the past... Right now, in this moment, you could not be better suited to be what she needs, and you made it clear to her the moment you sat on that floor."</em></p><p>Rio did not vocalize an answer. Instead, she lifted her hand out of her lap and held it out over the console, palm up. </p><p>Without another word, Agatha removed one hand from the wheel and repositioned the other before their fingers were linked and Agatha gripped Rio tightly by the contact. </p><p>It took them but a few more minutes to get home. Agatha had volunteered to bring in the groceries so that Rio could relocated Stevie to her bed for a brief nap. It would do her well to rest for a bit, to recharge that emotional battery that she had likely depleted in the throes of her weighted feelings.</p><p>Gripping as many bags as she could carry at one time, Agatha lifted her head to watch as Rio made it to the door, unlocked it, and then disappeared inside, all with a sleepy and limp Stevie cradled in her arm. </p><p>Agatha knew there would be many of moments like that one to come but she had to wonder if she'd feel them any less as time drew on. She hoped not. No matter what emotion those experiences caused, Agatha knew she needed to feel them all the same. There would be happy moments, there would be ones of anguish, and there would be ones of pain, surely. Experiencing them as they happened and processing to adapt was going to be the game to play here and Agatha was more than happy to engage.</p><p>She had been halfway through putting the groceries away when Rio's footsteps sounded as she wound her way down the stairs and appeared in the kitchen, a gentle expression on her face.</p><p>"Did she fight you on the nap?" Agatha asked in a soft and sweet tone.</p><p>Rio bent down to remove a few things from a bag and shook her head. </p><p>"She barely woke up. I put Señor Scratchy in her arms and she rolled over and went right back to sleep. I figured we could give her until three-thirty." Rio was being logical in her reasoning as she made a trip into the pantry to put the things in her hands away. </p><p>"Of course," Agatha agreed, wadding up a couple of the bags to dispose of them. The last item left was a four pack of macaroni and cheese cups that she tossed across the kitchen to Rio who was closer to the pantry and then put them away.</p><p>They finished the chore as Agatha turned on the kettle. She spun in place and leaned against the counter as Rio shuffled to stand in front of her, those gentle and kind hands landing on Agatha's hips as Rio leaned into her, placing the most delicate caress across her lips.</p><p><em>"I love you. And I'm really proud of you," </em>Agatha whispered against the contact that Rio did not immediately break.</p><p><em>"I love you too, and it... It means a lot. I... It's no secret that I don't know what I'm doing so I just act in the moment. I don't actually know if what I'm doing is the right thing, but... I'm just doing what I think would help." </em>Rio was trying to explain but hadn't she already realized she didn't have to? Didn't she understand that it was working anyway?</p><p><em>"And that's what makes you a good mama," </em>Agatha informed her, pulling back the slightest bit so that she could truly look at her wife. <em>"Mine might have hit a pause, and yours might just be beginning... But we're on the right track. Just can't let off the gas."</em></p><p>That had been a sentiment that Agatha needed to remember herself in the coming weeks.</p><p>They had settled into a routine for the most part in the six weeks since Stevie had been placed with them. With summer having arrived, Agatha was the one who spent the majority of her time with Stevie while Rio was at work. It had taken about a week and a half of Agatha watching over Stevie's shoulder when she played Fortnite on the Switch she had been gifted to decide that it looked... Well, rather fun.</p><p>Agatha had never given much consideration to video games before, but she had recognized the opportunity to get close as it presented itself and had done her research in turn. She had settled on purchasing herself a Playstation 5 for the other capabilities as well and also included a smaller screen than the one in the living room so that Stevie could use it, too, instead of the handheld.</p><p>So they would wake up around the time Rio left to wish her a good day, eat breakfast, then Stevie would play with her toys while Agatha floated about tidying up or tending to daily chores. After that, they would spend no more than an hour and a half playing Fortnite together. Agatha frequently had to remind herself to monitor her language, especially in those first few days that she had been figuring out the mechanics.</p><p>For being a five-year-old, Stevie was... almost impressive. She knew what she was doing, even if Agatha couldn't fathom how, but more times than not Agatha was the one who went down first and each and every time Stevie's laughter at the fact could nearly lift Agatha right from her spot and carry her away.</p><p>Outside of that, things had been manageable. The two of them were working hard with Stevie on finding ways to channel her anger and other harsh emotions into more positive things, but it was a slow-going process. Still, the majority of her tantrums were typical of a child her age and they were easy enough to deal with. She wasn't violent, didn't physically lash out, but those pained wails and screams could sink Agatha every time.</p><p>As deep as they could sink her, it was nothing compared to what had happened on a Saturday evening as Agatha was cleaning up the dishes from their meal. </p><p>Rio was playfully chasing Stevie around the first floor, the giggles and squeals warming Agatha from head to toe. She glanced up to see Rio hunched as she moved, flexing her fingers while laughing maniacally.</p><p>"The tickle monster is gonna get you!" she declared. </p><p>Without looking where she was doing, Stevie took a hard right and her left foot caught the leg of the table that was in the foyer. Rio's photo and the candy jar remained in place but the flower vase that sat closer to the corner did not. It jostled roughly and then tipped, careening straight toward the hardwood floor where it completely shattered.</p><p>The very second it happened, Stevie froze, her eyes wild. She didn't look at either one of them before she immediately began to sob hysterically.</p><p>"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!" she nearly screamed as she took off toward the stairs, tearing up them. </p><p>Rio turned around, a devastatingly confused look painting itself over every inch of her expression. Agatha met it with one that was pretty similar.</p><p>"What..." Rio managed, her eyes flicking to the stairs for a second before turning back to Agatha. "What just happened?"</p><p>Agatha's brow pinched tightly as she let her gaze travel to the stairs, the sound of Stevie's heavy footsteps fading more and more the higher she got. There was no door slam, though, so perhaps all hope was not lost. </p><p>"I don't know... but you... you should go..." Agatha managed as she turned back to face Rio, her words broken by the sudden pace of her thoughts.</p><p>"I don't think it should be me," Rio admitted as she took a few slow steps toward Agatha. "I think... I think that this one needs a little bit of experience."</p><p>In the time it took her to try and draw in a breath, Agatha's heart got in the way as it leapt into her throat, nearly choking her. That sheer look of terror on Stevie's face had been... awful. She had looked so fucking scared, and the way she'd just bolted out of there? Agatha knew Rio was right, but Agatha was not sure how to field that kind of emotion.</p><p>It was Stevie's trauma, very present, right in front of them. Agatha had never really been in a situation like this one and yet, as Rio looked her in the eyes, so earnest and calm, there was the smallest crumb of resolve for Agatha to gather, and she did.</p><p>"Okay," she exhaled, chewing on her lip for only a moment with her eyes on the stairs before she looked back at Rio and took a steadying kiss.</p><p>She was slow in her ascent, giving Stevie a little more time to herself, even if it was only a minute or so. When Agatha reached the third floor, and then Stevie's room, she gave the lightest tap on the door with a couple of knuckles. Stevie was still crying, but Agatha hadn't been expecting to be met with sounds of pure hysteria and panic.</p><p>"I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I'm sorry!" </p><p>Those words, so frightened and shattered, so absolutely terrified. Those words, an honest plea for safety.</p><p><em>"Stevie,"</em> Agatha offered, her voice soft and low but still just enough to be heard over Stevie's crying. <em>"May I please come in?"</em></p><p>She did not stop crying, but she did lift her head to peer at Agatha as she stood in the doorway. Her little chest was still shaking and her expression was in absolute shambles as the tears poured furiously down those soft cheeks. She was watching, waiting. Stevie was trying to understand why Agatha was not screaming, why she wasn't throwing things or chasing her. Stevie was trying to integrate herself into a reality where Agatha was clearly not going to enter her space without her say-so.</p><p>Agatha gave a questioning tip of her head at the little girl, as if asking again for permission. The seconds ticked on, but Stevie nodded her head in resignation, at last.</p><p>As Agatha paced inside, her eyes landed on the rocking chair and then shifted to the bed before cutting back to the rocker once more. She made her decision and placed herself in it, turning her head to look over at Stevie.</p><p><em>"Do you want to sit with me?" </em>Agatha asked her, though she made no move to reach toward her.</p><p>Stevie seemed to consider this for a moment, her grey eyes shifting to Agatha's lap before she, too, made her choice. Slowly and with tears still free falling, Stevie pulled herself out of the bed in a way that revealed she had been gripping Señor Scratchy to her chest. Her feet hit the floor at the same time Agatha leaned forward, holding her arms out so she could pull Stevie into her lap.</p><p>While this was not exactly new for them -- Stevie liked to sit on Agatha's lap when she read -- the way that Stevie tucked herself into a fetal position with her head against Agatha's chest was. In turn, Agatha wrapped her arms around her little girl, holding her firmly there to her form.</p><p>Agatha ran her fingertips soothingly through Stevie's hair for a few long moments, just rocking her in the quiet of the room, only small squeaks emitting from the mechanics of the chair as it moved.</p><p>Agatha knew Stevie wasn't asleep and so she found her voice to ask an important question.</p><p>
<em>"Baby girl, why did you get so upset?"</em>
</p><p>Agatha had not been ready for the answer.</p><p>
<em>"'Cause when I break stuff, I get broken."</em>
</p><p>There had been no possible way that Agatha could have stopped the tears that sprung to her own eyes, her heart completely busting apart in her chest from the weight of those words, especially out of the mouth of someone who never should have had to say them. Her throat closed up instantaneously and she had to struggle to find a way to compartmentalize those emotions, knowing her words were very needed in that moment.</p><p><em>"Is that what happened when you met Dr. Rio?" </em>Agatha probed gently; she had a feeling she already knew the answer, but hearing Stevie say it aloud would give her a jumping off point.</p><p>She could feel Stevie as she nodded her head against Agatha's chest, sniffling softly now that the actual cries had stopped.</p><p><em>"I knocked the TV over and broke it. Mr. Brady chased me and hurt my hand when he kicked the door."</em> </p><p>This hurt. Hearing that small voice, that string of words was painful beyond comprehension in those moments. Agatha still needed that resolve and so she thought about the look in Rio's eyes before she had come up to tend to this and it helped. </p><p><em>"I need you to know something, Stevie," </em>Agatha voiced, shifting in a way that silently beguiled Stevie to look up at her. When she obliged, Agatha looked straight into those grey eyes, her honesty nearly bleeding out of her. <em>"Dr. Rio and I are never going to chase you. Coming here was the right thing to do, because this is your space. This is your safe place, and if you need to be in here with some big feelings, that's okay."</em></p><p>Agatha paused, pulling her fingers from the ends of Stevie's hair to instead reach up to smooth it back.</p><p>
<em>"Dr. Rio or myself will never come in without your permission. This is <b>your</b> safe place. If you need time, that's okay. Neither of us will come in here to yell at you, or chase you, or hurt you. In fact, when you're having these big feelings, I can almost promise you one of us will sit outside in the hall until you're ready to talk about them."</em>
</p><p>The shimmer of tears returned to Stevie's eyes again, but Agatha could tell that it was for a different reason.</p><p>
<em>"Really, Mrs. Agatha?"</em>
</p><p>Agatha's eyes burned again, but she blinked the feeling away as she leaned forward and pressed her lips to the top of Stevie's head, a wordless affirmation.</p><p>
<em>"Really, baby girl."</em>
</p><p>The recovery from that one hadn't been too tumultuous for Stevie, but it had weighed heavy on Agatha for days. Even recounting it to Rio that night in bed had nearly crushed her. Thinking about that look on Stevie's face, the painfully simple way she expressed the abuse she had endured, it was enough for Agatha to want to completely tank. </p><p>While the incident did not change any rules or structures that they had put in place, it had shifted Agatha's perspective on how to handle things and in relation, Rio had made small changes, too. It was just in the tones used, the words chosen. They were both so well spoken, but it was different when the receptive audience was a child.</p><p>With those adjustments, though, things did seem to flow a little easier. The days were melting into weeks, weeks that began to shift into months with ease. </p><p>Agatha was trying not to keep tabs, but over four months had passed and two more were looming in front of them. At that point, being told no was absolutely going to destroy the both of them, but she was still clinging to hope. </p><p>Nicole had passed on occasional updates; the last one had informed them that the next time she contacted them, it would hopefully be with a hearing date. They had thanked her as usual, but neither of them wanted to hinge on such a promise quite yet.</p><p>That particular Sunday afternoon, they had decided to go to the park that had the insane playground with ziplines and climbing walls that Stevie had come to love so much. They'd packed a little cooler with snacks and juice pouches and had set off into the mild September afternoon, clad in hoodies and pants to keep out any slight chill. </p><p>When they had arrived, Agatha and Rio had placed themselves on a bench just outside of the play area as Stevie ran headlong toward the jungle gym to play. There were other kids running around, laughing and shouting, and Stevie seemed to fit seamlessly right in with them. Agatha pulled her book out of the side pocket of the cooler and set to reading as Rio fished out a handful of grapes to snack on.</p><p>They'd only been sat like that for about ten minutes when something caught Rio's attention. </p><p>Agatha had been in the middle of a page, absorbed in what she was consuming so deeply that she missed the elevated shouts, and then the wailing. </p><p>Rio had seen the entire thing and was on booted feet in an instant, causing Agatha's head to whip up to try and identify where she was going. Stevie jumped off of the platform she had been standing on, landing next to a boy who was laying on his back, crying. At almost the exact same time Stevie raised her fist, Rio finished closing the gap and quickly scooped her up into a strong arm, carrying her away as Stevie shouted that she wanted to be put down.</p><p>Rio made her return, the stress that was coursing through her obvious in every inch as she put Stevie on her feet long enough to sit herself down and coax Stevie to sit, too.</p><p>"Hey, Stevie, hey," Rio tried in an attempt to get her attention, but she was still crying angrily, her head craned to try and keep eyes on the boy she had just about decked. Rio's hold on her hands was clearly only pissing her off more, judging by the way she was trying to pull them away. What Rio said next surely got her attention. "Stephanie Noelle." </p><p>It wasn't harsh, it wasn't angry. In fact, it was so impossibly tender in its begging that Agatha nearly broke apart on the spot.</p><p>Slowly, Stevie's head turned back around as she looked down at Rio on the ground. Rio knew she couldn't lose a second in the moment and pushed herself to speak again.</p><p>"You know that we tell you all of the time it's okay to have big feelings, and it's okay to be mad. But what it's <em>not</em> okay to do is use that anger to hurt other people." Rio gave a gentle tug on Stevie's hands, asking for her to come closer. Stevie read it immediately and folded herself to sit in Rio's lap, right in the cradle provided by the way her legs were crossed.</p><p>"I know you're upset and that he was probably being mean, but -- "</p><p>"He said my ring was stupid! He tried to take it from my necklace! It's mine and it's not stupid! Mrs. Agatha gave it to me!" Stevie cried out in frustration, the hot and angry tears still rampant in their freefall. </p><p>Agatha might have looked like she was composed from an outside perspective, but on the inside she was in absolute tatters. She knew that Stevie wasn't defending Agatha's honor in any way, but that ring <em>really fucking meant something</em> to Stevie and she was willing to literally throw hands over it. It was touching, even if the behavior was bad. </p><p>"You're right, Stevie, it's <em>not</em> stupid. It's important to you and that's what matters. So... Maybe next time someone says something mean or tries to take your things, you walk away and you give your ring a little spin while you think about something else. We just can't go around hitting people who upset us, okay?" </p><p>Agatha felt like she was watching true magic in the works. Rio's demeanor was so unassuming and gentle and the way she was handling this distraught and beautiful little girl was an absolute sight. There was no second guessing from Rio's end any more and it was an incredibly breathtaking sight to behold. </p><p>"Okay, Dr. Rio," Stevie voiced back, even if the look on her face nearly shouted her skepticism. </p><p>"Do you think that you can go play with the other kids for a bit longer and come over here if something else happens, or would you rather go home?" Rio was giving her the option. Yes, she had made a poor choice, but she was being informed appropriately on why it was wrong and why it couldn't happen again. It wasn't just a simple instance of acting out, it was Stevie's way of defending herself from experiences she'd endured in the past. </p><p>Stevie lifted her head to glance over at the playground, her lips worrying together as she seemed to sink a lot of thought into the offer. She turned back to look at Rio, her lips turning down at the corners. </p><p>"If we go home and I stay in my room for a little, when I come out can me and Mrs. Agatha play some Fortnite?" she asked, that voice still so impossibly small.</p><p>It was what she said that struck Agatha the hardest. Surely, they would have figured out a way to deal with this in regards to consequences, but Stevie seemed to be on it already. It obviously stemmed from her history, but she was recognizing that she had done something wrong and when she did something wrong, she spent time in her room. The reflection on the incident had already happened, but she was still committing herself to the punishment before they'd even enacted it.</p><p>"We'll talk about it when you're finding your peace again, okay?" Rio offered in return, her tone still hopeful. "And if we decide that the answer is no, we'll go out back and spend time with the fall flowers before they go away. Does that sound okay too?"</p><p>Although her initial expression had been one that communicated how distraught the idea made her, Rio's addendum seemed to soothe her. It was another showing from Rio of 'while you may not be able to have what you want, you can have something that is still suitable and enriching.'</p><p>"That sounds okay, Dr. Rio," Stevie agreed with a firm nod.</p><p>Agatha, from her spot a few feet away on the bench, realized that she had been holding her breath, even if she was not aware just how long she had been doing so. The exhale she managed deflated her posture the slightest bit but it was only because she was thankful this didn't have to go any further. </p><p>For as much as Stevie's behavior could have been condemned, the important part in these interactions was that she seemed <em>so</em> receptive to change and input on how to make it happen. She was still going to be a kid, yes, but she had also endured more in five years than most adults ever face in their lifetimes. Learning to navigate that was going to be tricky in any regard, but Agatha knew that she and Rio were committed.</p><p>They'd packed their things up and retreated to the car, the ride home only filled with the sounds of Rio's music from the playlist that seemed to soothe Stevie the most. Even the shuffle back into the house had been quiet. The door shut behind Agatha and she locked it, turning to see Rio muss Stevie's hair a bit.</p><p>"Go find your peace, kid. We'll check in in a little bit, okay?" </p><p>Stevie gave a nod of acknowledgement and carried herself up the stairs to her room for a little bit of alone time to process her feelings. Before Rio even turned back to face Agatha, Agatha was speaking.</p><p>"I'm not punishing her," she stated simply. "She's punishing herself enough right now."</p><p>Rio visibly relaxed, seeming to have had the same train of thought. She approached Agatha and pressed their fronts together, letting her head drop to rest on Agatha's shoulder. </p><p>In a blink, Agatha's arms raised and secured firmly around her wife, holding her tight. She turned just enough so that she was able to brush her lips over the skin of Rio's forehead.</p><p><em>"I'm proud of her for centering so quickly, but I'm proud of you for giving her a reason to. You... You handled that... Jesus, Rio. That was incredible to watch. And I think you need to know that whether she can say it or not, you are her mama and she knows it." </em>Agatha's words were whispered there against that skin, as if saying them there might help them sink in a little better because of the proximity.</p><p><em>"I'm a patient human,"</em> Rio stated, and of this, Agatha was completely aware. <em>"She can take however long she needs, just like her mom."</em></p><p>There was an instant burn behind Agatha's eyes followed by a single tear that slipped down her neck and dropped off of her jaw, the splash minimal as it landed on her collarbone.</p><p>
<em>"I love you, Rio, and I love her, and this life we have. More than I can ever tell you."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I know you do, Agatha, and I love you too. But... I have faith you'll find the words someday."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Yeah, maybe someday."</em>

<p>There had been expected memories to be made, ones that Agatha had held in her mind with anticipatory thrill: the first tooth Stevie lost under their roof, the first time she trusted them enough to ask them bigger questions, the first completed sentence she read. Those had all come and gone with the rush that Agatha had thought they might arrive with and the satisfaction and joy left in their wake that she had always hoped for.</p><p>There were other memories that were unexpected, ones that never could have been planned for or even thought about ahead of time. </p><p>Agatha had an unexpected memory now, one that still brought a smile to her lips each moment she recalled it.</p><p>
<em>There had been a wasp in the house. It wasn't all that strange for late September, but that damn wasp did nothing but cause chaos.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha had always known that Rio did not favor killing insects. Her method was a little more humane in that she was always trying to catch them to release them back outside where they could live their happy little bug lives. When it came to wasps? Rio didn't fuck with wasps, per her own words, after she'd been stung by the creek she grew up around when she was a kid.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It explained why Rio had been running around the second story with a shoe in her hand, trying to pin it enough that she could crush it beneath the rubber sole. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha and Stevie had been watching with Stevie occasionally cheering Rio on when she got really close and then assuring her that the next time, she would definitely get it. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"I need the flyswatter!" Rio had nearly shrieked in her frustration.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I'll go get it!" Stevie declared excitedly as she turned to head down to the first floor. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha was simply amused, leaning against the partitioning of the banister as she watched her wife lose every marble she had over a wasp. A couple of minutes passed, though, and Stevie had still not returned.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Stevie? You okay down there?" Agatha called over her shoulder.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Yes! I'm coming! I got it!" Stevie yelled back from the bottom of the stairs as she began to make her way up them. Upon her approach, Agatha glanced down to see her holding a small cup filled with water. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha's brow pinched and her head tilted in confusion. That was certainly not the flyswatter.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Stevie, baby, what's that? Where's the flyswatter?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>At this, Stevie was the one who looked confused. Her focus dropped from Agatha's face to the cup in her hand, trying to compute and process. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"It's right here," she stated, tone flat as she looked back up at Agatha. She looked almost offended that Agatha was asking such a question.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And then, it smacked into Agatha like a misfired watermelon out of a slingshot, hitting her dead in the face.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stevie had done exactly what she had been asked.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She had gotten the flies water.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Even if it was a wasp.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Do you have it?!" Rio nearly shouted, swinging the shoe again just to the right of the window, missing again.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Yes and no. Give me one moment, wasp terminator."</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha pushed off of the railing and leaned down, kissing the top of Stevie's ahead before she zipped down the stairs and retrieved the truly desired item. She turned on her heel and made her way back up, listening.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"But this is the water for the flies," Stevie was explaining to Rio who had stopped her mission to turn around and behold their daughter with the most smitten expression.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She reached the top of the stairs and ruffled Stevie's hair a bit as she handed the plastic weaponry over to her wife. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"That swats flies," Agatha indicated to her with a light flourish to the item she had just handed over. "But still, good job."</em>
</p><p>It was memories like that one, the truly joyous ones that came out of nothing more than sheer happenstance, that Agatha desperately wanted to cling to the tightest. They were the memories that she had thought about being able to make that night, the night Rio had first told her about Stevie.</p><p>She had been so terrified then, so unsure of herself and her abilities to be something she had resigned herself to never being again: a mother. </p><p>Agatha had laid in that bed in that townhouse and stared at that ceiling, trying to find all of the answers to too many questions that the universe had been asking her. She had truly found not only her place, but her purpose too. She had found her ability to love and say it out loud.</p><p>By the time October began, things had started to fee a little too close to real. Agatha's tally was growing in days they had behind them, but she still couldn't quite get to the point where she could start counting down the ones ahead of them. They still had no definitive answer and it was something she was <em>still</em> trying to not lose sleep over, even if she wasn't always successful.</p><p>It was a chilly Saturday, late morning, when there was a sharp rapping on the door. Rio was the one to jump into action and Agatha absolutely had not missed the wicked grin that had curled Rio's lips as she did so.</p><p>What was she up to?</p><p>Agatha was a little too focused on the match she and Stevie were in on Fortnite to offer much interrogation, though she was trying to divide her attention enough to listen to the exchange at the front door. She couldn't hear much, not until Rio thanked the man she had been speaking to and Agatha sensed he walked away. </p><p>Rio did not immediately shut the door, though.</p><p>Agatha's head lifted, tearing her eyes away once she had found a suitable place to hide. She looked back over toward the front door and saw Rio dragging three boxes inside. Once accomplished, she closed the door and put her hands on her hips, staring down at the items for a moment in contemplation.</p><p>"My love?" Agatha called, light and sweet.</p><p>"Hm?" Rio returned, lifting her head to lock their gazes. The same moment, a wide grin split her lips.</p><p>"What's that you've got there?" </p><p>"An office chair." Okay, so that was one item. There were still two more. And, moreover, they already had chairs for each desk in the house. Where had the necessity come for another one?</p><p>"That's one of three, please do keep going," Agatha urged, cocking a brow in question.</p><p>"This one," Rio said as she picked up the flattest box, though also the widest, "is a 37 inch television."</p><p>Still, Agatha was not following and the misunderstanding was the most prevalent thing on her face. She did not offer an additional prodding, though, knowing Rio would reach the next checkmark eventually. And, she did.</p><p>"The last one," she indicated by tipping her head down to where it sat atop the box she had indicated was the chair, "is my own Playstation. So that even though I've been playing on yours when you're not home and getting your kill count higher, I figured it was time to get my own so we could all play together."</p><p>First and foremost, Agatha just about melted on the spot. She hadn't known that Rio had been playing with Stevie because Stevie had never mentioned it, which Agatha honestly thought to be a bit odd. However, when she glanced down beside her, Stevie was grinning up at her with the most sheepish expression on her face.</p><p>"I did <em>not</em> tell her to not say anything!" Rio asserted, though it was a little rocky with the sounds of the laughter that she was fighting to contain.</p><p>Stevie let out that ever-so-sweet sound of a giggle and Agatha pivoted her arm at the elbow, flipping nearly ninety degrees as she shifted to pinch Stevie's side in a playful tickle. More laughter bubbled from her, filling the morning air around them in a way that made Agatha feel whole and full.</p><p>"She was just helping you, Mrs. Agatha!" Stevie managed between her laughs, squirming around but not trying to actually get away.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Agatha grumbled as she relented in her attack. As she tucked her now free hand over the back of the couch, Rio still looked pretty deep in thought. She was looking at the boxes, but then she would glance toward the living room, clearly doing calculations in her head. Whatever she was thinking, it wasn't going to work judging by the expression that slid onto her beautiful face.</p><p>As Agatha's lips parted to ask a question, she felt the controller in her hand vibrate and Stevie let out a shriek next to her. </p><p>"Mrs. Agatha! They're getting you! Run!"</p><p>At such a call, Agatha pried her attention away from her vexed wife to finish the rest of her game with Stevie, in which they managed to place 5th. </p><p>"Snack break, kid," Agatha indicated as she gave Stevie's knee a light tap. "Dr. Rio picked up a box of the honey granola bars that you like last night. They're in the pantry by the cereal."</p><p>Stevie nodded her head at the same time she was pushing off of the couch, taking off toward the kitchen to retrieve a bite to eat. Agatha's eyes fell over to Rio who now had her fingertips pressed to her chin, lips tight in a thin line as she seemed to think. After another moment of thought, her hand fell to her pocket and produced her phone.</p><p>"You okay over there, handsome? You're looking mightily perplexed," Agatha offered.</p><p>Rio did not look up from her phone, flicking her thumb as she scrolled, but she did answer. </p><p>"Yeah. Just finally figured out what we're gonna do with the empty room down here." The effort in the answer was a little lackluster but Rio was very obviously trying to hold the conversation while doing something else.</p><p>"Is that so?" Agatha asked, her lips curling into a sly smile. "Care to share?"</p><p>Rio's head lifted and she offered a guilty curve of her lips before she paced over and took Stevie's spot on the couch next to Agatha. She kept scrolling but held her phone in a way that Agatha could easily look down and witness for herself what Rio was up to.</p><p>Rio was browsing television stands. At first, Agatha didn't understand. What did that have to do with the spare room? </p><p>"It should be a game room. We can move everything that's in here in there. Since we'll all three be playing together, it's probably the smartest way to keep us close enough that we don't have to shout." Rio's explanation was so deadpan, so matter-of-fact that Agatha simply blinked, stunned for just a moment. Why hadn't she thought of that?</p><p>"That's... actually really fucking smart." Agatha was impressed, honestly, and though her tones were low her words showed it. And were also not low enough to not be overheard as Stevie trounced back to the living room with her granola bar and juice pouch.</p><p>"That's a bad word, Mrs. Agatha. You owe a dollar to the jar," she stated just before she took a sip of her juice and hopped into the spot on the other side of Rio on the couch.</p><p>"You're right, I do," Agatha offered in concession. "I'll put it in there later. But... It was because I got really excited at what Dr. Rio is planning."</p><p>"What are you planning, Dr. Rio?" Stevie asked, leaning forward so she could crane her neck in an attempt to get a glance at what Rio was busying herself with.</p><p>"I was thinking that we can use that empty room by Mrs. Agatha's office for a game room so we can all play together in the same space." Rio gave the answer like it was nothing more than a fact of life, almost like she was trying to downplay the overly excited reaction she was about to receive at such news.</p><p>Every single light in Stevie's eyes began to beam and her grin instantly matched them. "Really?! We're gonna have a whole room to play games in?" </p><p>"I think that's the move," Rio agreed with a nod, turning her head enough so that she could look down at Stevie next to her. "What do you think? Good idea?"</p><p>"I think it's a really good idea, Dr. Rio!" Stevie answered almost instantly, the utter elation thick and sweet on her tone as though it was coated in honey.</p><p>Agatha's hand slid, careful and calculated like a snake slithering in the grass, to canvas the top of Rio's thigh, giving it a light and supportive squeeze. Even all these months later, Rio was still making moves to improve their lives, finding ways to bring new bouts of happiness and joy to their day-to-day. </p><p>In less than a few seconds, the hand that wasn't holding Rio's phone covered the back of Agatha's and her fingers curled around it, giving a light squeeze. </p><p>"Then that settles it. I'm going to order the stuff and when it comes, we can set it up together, yeah?" That question from Rio was met with only a surge of motion from Stevie who hugged Rio tight around the middle, holding herself close.</p><p>"You're the best," Stevie murmured into the fabric of Rio's t-shirt.</p><p>Rio laughed softly, setting her phone on her lap so that she could reach to rub Stevie's back sweetly. Rio's mouth opened and Agatha could almost see it leave her lips, right before they pressed and she swallowed hard, choking down words she wanted to say but at the same time, were words that still felt so very dangerous.</p><p>
<em>I love you, kid.</em>
</p><p>All of this needed to be on Stevie's terms, but there were certain things that felt fragile, things that they did not want to jinx or curse ahead of time. Agatha could tell by the slightest flicker of indignation that crossed Rio's face that she was pained by the reality in which that could not be a freely delivered sentiment for someone she truly did love.</p><p>Agatha's hand on Rio's leg gave Rio's fingers a soft squeeze and she leaned over, giving her cheek a soft kiss. </p><p>"I'm going to make us some lunch. Don't even think about getting back on my profile," Agatha teased, a smile filling her face that wrinkled the corners of her eyes. Those moments, the small and seemingly insignificant ones, they were the ones that mattered the most. Those were the ones where the brick continued to get place, building higher and higher.</p><p>A wrecking crew coming in at that point would have completely destroyed them both. </p><p>By the end of the week, all of the parts and pieces had arrived and Rio had relocated it all to the empty room. She had gone over the purchase list with Agatha before she had submitted the order and while Agatha had known that Rio did absolutely nothing in her life in a half-assed fashion, actually seeing what she had compiled?</p><p>There were two metal stands with mounts on them, and one wooden stand that would support the bigger television Rio had also put in her cart for Agatha (so that they wouldn't have to relocate the living room one). She had purchased decorations, like a large shelf that was shaped like a moon where they could stow their games. Rio had even bought two hundred feet worth of LED lights to place about the room in whatever way they so chose.</p><p>Saturday had been building day. Agatha had offered more than once to assist, even with putting the chairs together, but Rio had assured her each time that she and Stevie were entirely capable of doing it themselves. Agatha didn't feel left out -- if anything, she wanted to encourage it -- and instead agreed to leave them to it. </p><p>She had set about the house tending to other things like laundry and dishes, as well as just straightening up the majority of the rooms they occupied. Every so often she would pop into the spare room with snacks and juice to keep them fueled in their mission. Each time, there was more progress. </p><p>When she had finished up basic upkeeping, Agatha had slowly slid up to the doorframe. She just wanted to check on them, watch the two of them for a couple of minutes. She could hear them before she peered inside.</p><p>Stevie was giggling as she sat on the beanbag Rio had gotten her, watching as Rio worked.</p><p>"I don't think that's the right part, Dr. Rio," she managed through her laughter.</p><p>Inside, Rio was putting together the wooden stand. She had, at that point, pulled her hair up into a ponytail that was stationed higher up on the back of her head, allowing for a perfect display of that gorgeous neck of hers. Her arms were exposed from the way she had cut the sleeves off of that particular shirt and her biceps flexed attractively in their effort. Rio was hunched over, using a hammer to tap the slotted wood into place without using too much force.</p><p>"It is, baby, it's just being really stubborn. But see, I think I got it. Can you hand me the other piece now please?" she posed, her tone light. </p><p>Stevie complied, hopping up to scoop up the piece and deliver it to Rio.</p><p>Agatha <em>knew.</em> She knew deep down that she should have been looking upon that moment with reverence and affection to see her wife and daughter working together to make something they could all enjoy together. <em>She knew it.</em> But all she could focus on was not only how incredible Rio was as a human being, but also just how fucking good she looked while being one.</p><p>In terms of their sex life, it had not taken too much of a hit upon Stevie's permanent placement, but Agatha had regressed a bit in terms of holding onto control. With such a big change, she had reigned it in quite a bit and while being physical with Rio would be something she always craved, she'd been less inclined to give Rio the reigns while they were still figuring out the bigger facets of their lives.</p><p>Looking at Rio right then? Agatha had every desire to obtain the power to time travel so that it could be well after midnight and Stevie would be tucked away in her bed, sleeping.  Instead, she was stood with only her head in the open doorway, gawking like some kind of horny teenager.</p><p>Rio screwed in the last leg of the stand and straightened up, but as if she had felt something unexplained, her head turned and eyes locked with Agatha's, who's body was not visible in the slightest. As Rio read the look on her face, though, it just caused her to grin right before she bent over and lifted the entire stand -- in a way that looked way too easy for how large it actually was -- and relocated it to where it would sit for their intended purposes. </p><p>Before Rio could glance back toward the door again, Agatha had removed herself from it to fetch herself a glass of cold water from the front of refrigerator door. Her mind was already way ahead of itself but she knew that it was pointless to dwell or even attempt to fantasize. But oh, what she wouldn't have given for those strong hands to have her at their mercy. What she wouldn't have done to slip back into that frame of mind where she felt comfortable enough in every other aspect of their lives that she could fork over that iron will and say without hesitation 'fuck it.'</p><p>Agatha had only been mildly successful in distracting herself throughout the day. She'd picked up a book and thumbed through the pages, but her mind often wandered. It skipped over to those blossomed memories from earlier in the day, the way Rio's muscles flexed and the way her teeth dug into her bottom lip as she worked. It frolicked over to the recollections of the small beads of sweat that had gathered near Rio's temple and how she had so easily brushed them away with the back of her hand.</p><p>When the act of reading quickly proved itself to not work, Agatha had wandered upstairs and began to organize the closet, though every time her eyes happened to land on that canvas, her mind would slip again. </p><p>Agatha was only human and while she knew that she had reached a point in her life where she had to prioritize, she couldn't help but get lost in the reminiscence that could sometimes strike her of what it was to shoulder fewer responsibilities. While she meant it every single time she stated how much she loved the life they had built, there were still some times on a random Saturday when Agatha was struck by the urge to get lost in every inch of Rio's skin and warmth she could get to.</p><p>The nights of Rio at her mercy, those whispered sighs and stifled moans, they were great, sure. Any chance Agatha got to taste her, to kiss her, to truly feel her was always an ethereal experience, but the idea of letting those roles reverse again? It hadn't crossed her mind frequently before that day, but it was getting to a point where she could think about little else.</p><p>Agatha had decided to order them dinner to reward the two of them for their hard work.</p><p>"How does pizza sound?" Agatha proposed, leaning against the frame of the door while Rio busied herself with mounting one of the TVs to a steel stand.</p><p>"Sounds good to me," Rio voiced over her shoulder, giving a light shrug.</p><p>"That sounds good!" Stevie chirped happily. "But can mine have the little pepperoni's?"</p><p>At this, both Agatha and Rio cut their attention straight to Stevie, the surprise surely visible on both of their faces. It was an unusual request, one that had been made for the first time since they'd taken custody of her.</p><p>"Are you sure?" came Agatha's question, unable to hide the skepticism in her voice. </p><p>"I tried them at school and they're real good," Stevie answered simply, offering a shrug that almost mirrored the one Rio had offered thirty seconds prior as she looked down at the roll of lights in her hand, waiting for Rio to tell her when they could start hanging them.</p><p>"You got it," Agatha returned with a bright smile before she disappeared once more to order their meal.</p><p>The three of them had sat at the dining room table, eating their pizza, while Stevie listed the few items left that they still had to take care of, but it was essentially all of the places Rio had told her they were going to put the LEDs. </p><p>Agatha had been fully aware of the lives they had been living for months on end, at that point, but in those moments as Rio tapped her finger to the end of Stevie's nose, causing her to giggle through a mouthful of pizza, Agatha felt it; it was the domesticity that she had spent a decade and a half terrified of. And for what? It was peaceful, it was remarkable, it was calming. It was everything Agatha had tried not to be for so long.</p><p>What was more was that she didn't just <em>like </em>it. She <em>loved </em>it and could not let herself imagine a future where she didn't get to have it. </p><p>Agatha had helped them hang the light strips after dinner and she could have sworn that there was absolutely nothing better than Stevie's animated and joyous reaction to what it looked like once everything was set up and illuminated by the multi-colored lights that lined the backs of the televisions and the edges of the stand. Rio had even lined the moon-shaped shelf with them and set it to reflect a white light, which against the dark navy of the wall looked incredible.</p><p>It had been too late to do much more than play one game together, but that one game had sent Stevie completely buzzing when they got the victory. Her reaction had been priceless, the way she had leapt out of her beanbag, clutching the Switch controller in her hand as she nearly ran into Rio's knee.</p><p>"We did it, Dr. Rio! We did it Mrs. Agatha! We all won together!" </p><p>"We make a pretty good squad, huh?" Agatha offered, spinning a bit in her chair to face them better.</p><p>"Can we play one more?" Stevie asked, this time her eyes landing on Agatha.</p><p>"Maybe tomorrow. It's pretty late. We should get ready for bed soon. Do you want some star fruit for a snack before bedtime?" Agatha answered as diplomatically as she could. She knew that Stevie likely wouldn't be thrilled with that response but she handled it a bit better than Agatha had thought she might.</p><p>"Can I have some kiwis too?" she questioned, those beautiful grey eyes so soft in their request.</p><p>"Of course. Whatever you want, baby," Agatha assured her, her lips curling in a gentle smile.</p><p>They had powered everything down and turned off all of the lights except the ones around the moon and departed to the kitchen so they could wind down for the rest of the evening. Agatha had set about cutting the fruit and plating it so that Stevie could devour it the moment it was set in front of her. </p><p>While she was eating, Rio had set about making Stevie's water for the night that was kept at the side of her bed just in case. Agatha had sidled up next to her to wash off the knife she had been using.</p><p><em>"Hi, my hot handyman,"</em> Agatha cooed at her as she pinched the sponge over the blade of the knife, running it under the water that Rio had left running for her.</p><p><em>"Hi, my beautiful wife," </em>Rio returned, their shoulders pressing firm with the way she leaned over to steal the softest kiss from Agatha's lips.</p><p><em>"I enjoyed watching the progress." </em>It wasn't a lie, exactly, but Agatha was well aware Rio was not stupid enough to not pick up on the fact that there was more there.</p><p>
<em>"Is that the only thing you enjoyed watching?"</em>
</p><p><em>"That's a conversation for after hours," </em>Agatha suggested, a sly smirk curling her lips as her brow raised. </p><p><em>"Mmm, thought it might be. We'll check back in a bit then, hm?" </em>Rio murmured, a smirk of her own pushing up her right cheek more than her left. <em>"Should I keep the hair up or the shirt on?"</em></p><p>A crack of lightning flashed across Agatha's electric blue eyes, a pool of lava forming right in her middle. </p><p><em>"Oh, clothes are absolutely coming off. The hair can stay though," </em>Agatha purred at her, tipping her chin enough to catch Rio's lips in a kiss that, while tame, had just enough heat in it to be mildly enticing.</p><p>Rio let out a low grumble that was closer to a growl just before her lips parted to speak but Agatha was already moving to tend to Stevie who was finishing up the last of her fruit. There was an additional brightness, rooted in her mischief, to her smile as she did so. </p><p>The three of them made their way up the stairs to get ready for bed. Once Stevie was changed, she climbed into bed. At the same time, she let out a loud yawn that, for a moment, Agatha thought might have been an exaggeration. Watching as Stevie pulled Scratchy to her chest and closed her eyes immediately, it became obvious that the day's events had worn her out. </p><p>Agatha leaned over and pressed a kiss to Stevie's temple, letting her lips linger for just a moment.</p><p><em>"Goodnight, sweet girl. Have the best dreams," </em>she whispered against the soft skin there.</p><p><em>"You too, Mrs. Agatha," </em>Stevie murmured just before another yawn took over her.</p><p>Agatha straightened up but found herself unable to keep from reaching down to brush her thumb over the apple of Stevie's cheek. </p><p>She wanted to say it, too, just like Rio had earlier in the day.</p><p>
<em>I love you, kid.</em>
</p><p>Agatha kept it in, though. </p><p>Somehow, she kept it in.</p><p>She turned and made her way toward the door, pausing to place a soft kiss to the side of Rio's head. After another thought, she ducked back in and pressed her lips to Rio's ear, too. It was quick, too quick, but the moment Rio's posture stiffened even the slightest bit, she knew it was effective.</p><p>Agatha departed the room, soft footfalls leading her to their bedroom. She knew it might be a few minutes before Rio would join her and so she set about her nightly routine. She washed her face and brushed her teeth, taking the extra few moments to moiturize, too.</p><p>She had considered throwing her hair up but then thought better of it; she rather liked it when Rio wrapped a good portion of it around her fist and gave it a good pull when she entered that frantic rhythm of not being able to get close enough.</p><p>Pacing back into the bedroom, she had been debating heading into the closet to acquire what it was she wanted but before she could make any move toward it, she heard their door shut behind her. Her feet had just started to move to turn around but the moment she began to build momentum, it was halted by the feeling of Rio's hands as they slid flatly over the haunches of Agatha's hips toward the front of her body. </p><p>The way Rio's thumbs and fingertips met, they formed a diamond of open space directly over the area between Agatha's navel and her core, even if it was still covered in the fabric of her leggings. Concurrently, Rio's chin had landed pointedly on Agatha's shoulder and the front of her body was flush with the back of Agatha's.</p><p>That kind of closeness always set Agatha's heart into a full sprint, hammering against her ribcage in an attempt to break free. Her eyes slid shut and her head turned just enough that the tip of her nose landed in the hair above Rio's ear and a soft hum of appreciation passed through closed lips. Fluidly, her arm raised and fingertips slid into the tightly pulled back hair on the opposing side before they wrapped around the fabric of the elastic in her hair.</p><p><em>"Hello, Daddy Rio," </em>Agatha teased airily, her breath hot on her own face with the proximity of Rio's head as it rested on her shoulder.</p><p>A light pressure from Rio's palms caused Agatha to suck in a quick breath, a wicked grin curling her lips.</p><p><em>"I have been thinking about you totally manhandling that TV stand all fucking day. Any chance you wanna recreate, but only I'm the TV stand this time?" </em>Agatha suggested, her tone lower this time, a huskier edge clinging to her words.</p><p>Rio breathed an amused chuckle as she shifted her head, using her forehead to nudge Agatha's cheek in a silent command that she turn her head forward. When she complied, Agatha felt Rio's lips the instant they met the crook of her neck, compelling Agatha to release her hold on the ponytail, hand falling to land on Rio's forearm.</p><p>Those first few kisses were gentle, they were affectionate and measured. The higher they climbed up the side of her neck, though, they grew hungrier. Each kiss was deliberate, as was the soft sucking that followed for only a couple of seconds after. </p><p>By the time Rio's teeth sank into the lobe of Agatha's ear at the same time Rio applied enough force to her middle to force her hips back, Agatha had already turned into compliant putty, a sighed moan escaping her without permission.</p><p><em>"I forget how much you love teeth when you get like this," </em>Rio offered in a jeering but sultry murmur directly into Agatha's ear. </p><p><em>"How could you forget such an important fact?" </em>Agatha posed back, fighting to keep the breathlessness she was feeling from touching her tone. </p><p>Instead of a verbal answer, Rio simply sunk her teeth into the flesh of Agatha's shoulder that was just barely exposed from the way the neck of her shirt was cut. In the same moment, one of Rio's hands began a quick journey forward, cupping the apex between Agatha's thighs. The moment she felt Rio's firm touch, Agatha sunk her teeth into her bottom lip and a quiet reverberation of a moan echoed right out of her. Mindlessly, her hips rocked down into the contact and for once, she was thankful that Rio's intention was not to be a little shit. </p><p>Agatha had half a mind to redirect her by taking hold of her hand and shoving it in those leggings, but that would have only been delaying the inevitable. Instead, she gave a soft squeeze on Rio's forearm. It wasn't frantic but Agatha suddenly had an overwhelming urge to eliminate any barriers between them.</p><p>Rio seemed to catch on and released her hold, picking both of her hands up off of Agatha's body. They were quick to find their way back as her fingers tucked into the waist of the leggings, as well as the panties beneath it, and gave a gentle tug to let them pool at Agatha's ankles. Without wasting even a second, Rio proceeded to do one of the sexiest things Agatha was sure she had ever experienced.</p><p>Rio wrapped both arms around Agatha's torso from behind, crossing them in front of her before she secured the hem of Agatha's shirt in two spots. She placed a firm kiss to the spot just below Agatha's ear before she pulled up, causing Agatha to lift both arms to accommodate the removal of the garment. </p><p>It wasn't that it was a power move, or that the act itself was sexy. It was the intimacy, the way that even though she was about to let Rio completely fuck her senseless, Rio was still so deliberate and so adoring in the way she handled Agatha. </p><p>It was the love that made it so sexy.</p><p>Even more so was the way Rio resumed her work of stripping Agatha down by moving her wild hair over one shoulder so that she could begin a trail of kisses at the nape of her neck, one that wound down the course of her spine as nimble fingers freed the clasp on her back with a deft precision. Her touch was gentle as she placed her fingertips to Agatha's shoulders to press the straps down her arms so her bra could fall away, no longer a required item. </p><p>For as absolutely feral as Agatha had felt earlier in the day, and for how amped she still was, there was something so fucking intense about the way that instead of stripping herself down, Rio stepped back into Agatha and slid her hands up the bare abdomen to her chest, cupping each breast in a palm as her lips kissed over the entire scape of the top of the newly barren shoulder that had been exposed after the removal of the nuisance that had been her shirt.</p><p>It was a tender moment, one that almost felt <em>too</em> tender for how absolutely wired Agatha felt, but she let herself exist in it for just a few moments. She let her wife kiss over her skin as her grasp worked and kneaded over her chest, working her a little more toward that fervent state. </p><p><em>"Rio," </em>Agatha managed, nothing more than a whisper into the night. </p><p>In answer, one of Rio's hands relinquished its hold and began to sail over the skin of Agatha's middle, diving right between her legs. The moment she felt Rio's touch as it brushed over her clit for a split second, Agatha had to fight to keep her knees from buckling. Instead of a moan, this time, it was a sharp hiss.</p><p><em>"Rio," </em>Agatha pressed again, though it came out as a whine more than anything else. <em>"I need you. Please. It's been so long."</em></p><p>This struck something in her wife who inhaled quickly and then proceeded to hold her breath, her touch stilling in the wetness it had been reveling in. She pulled her hand back slowly, but not all the way before Agatha caught her wrist between a circled grasp. </p><p>Rio was completely still other than the movement of her arm guided by Agatha's hold as she raised Rio's fingers up and directly to her lips, sucking the first two clean for just a few seconds before she removed them and let go. Already, she could hear Rio's breath pick up in its pace and a devious smirk found Agatha's lips. </p><p>As the contact was broken, she turned to aid Rio in undressing, but Rio was already nearly tearing that cut off shirt over her head, throwing it aside haphazardly. In almost the blink of an eye, she was shucking her shorts to kick them away along with her underwear. </p><p>The moment they were both bare, Agatha took just a moment to appreciate something she could never get enough of: her wife in every inch of her glory. Maybe it hadn't even been a year since they'd met but that didn't matter to Agatha because what she saw in that moment? It was her whole heart, her whole life. Even though they had expanded on that idea, Rio was still the very base of it all. </p><p>Rio allowed her to have the moment but then stepped forward, cradling Agatha's jaw in both palms, pulling her in for a warm and untempered kiss, one that steadily grew hotter almost every second it wore on. The way Agatha felt it in every inch of her body as the tip of Rio's tongue slid easily on the underside of her top lip, it caused a shiver to rip through her. Just as she parted her lips to grant entrance, Rio pulled away.</p><p>Immediately, Agatha's lips turned down into a frown and her brow pinched tight but the amusement was clear on Rio's face.</p><p><em>"I'm a little under dressed, don't you think?" </em>Rio crooned, leaning in to steal one more kiss. <em>"Get comfortable. I'll be back in a minute."</em></p><p>Agatha's voracious grin was back in a flash and she gave a nod of understanding as Rio and her cute little asscheeks wandered into the closet and disappeared around the corner. </p><p>Per the instructions she had been given, Agatha climbed onto that big bed of theirs and placed herself on her stomach for the couple of moments it took for Rio to pull the harness on. It was safety for her, security in the sense that Rio held all of the control in those coming moments.</p><p>Agatha was aware of the sounds of her shuffling as she approached the side of the bed, setting the coconut oil on her nightstand before scooping a smattering of it out onto a couple of fingers. </p><p>Agatha watched with hungry eyes as Rio worked the oil over the appendage between her legs and knelt onto the bed. </p><p>It took no longer than a beat for Rio to lean over, peppering kisses across the expanse of Agatha's back, leaving her to heave content but slightly worked up sighs every so often. Rio shifted, though, and straddled the backs of Agatha's thighs, though she did not settle onto them. Instead, she chose to do something that elicited a surprised yelp from Agatha.</p><p>She gave her right asscheek a firm smack, one that was far louder than either of them had thought it might be. Rio's touch was smooth as it immediately rubbed over the reddening area before her fingertips began to glide to Agatha's hip, her other hand hooking in an identical spot on the other side.</p><p><em>"Do you want a pillow, or do you wanna get on your hands a knees like a good girl?" </em>Rio questioned lowly, giving a firm squeeze on both of Agatha's hips as if to punctuate her question.</p><p>The softest gasp escaped Agatha at the use of the pet name, but it only encouraged her. She pushed herself up so that she was on all fours, giving her hips a little wiggle as she pressed them back, the tip of the dildo catching against the flesh of her ass. The mere feeling of it caused a gentle moan to press past her parted lips.</p><p><em>"You ready, beautiful?" </em>Rio hummed in question, removing one of her hands from the hook of Agatha's hipbone so that she could use it to guide herself upon receiving permission. It was permission that came in the quietest whimper.</p><p><em>"Please, Rio," </em>she pleaded in a whisper.</p><p>With the go-ahead so obviously in front of her, Rio used her hold to press down on the silicone so that it pressed between Agatha's lips and skimmed over her clit, riding the slick in a wave up to her core. Careful, as she always was, Rio pressed forward, sinking into Agatha. That familiar stretch nearly consumed her, but she managed to keep the pleasured moan that clawed its way out to a lower register despite just how fucking good it felt.</p><p>Those initial few strokes were slow, an easing into what was sure to come. Rio's hand had found its grip once more on Agatha's hip, regaining the leverage she desired for what was on its way.</p><p>The quicker each thrust became, the more taken Agatha felt. Rio knew how to fuck her, sure, but there was something different, something more. It was difficult to put a name to it, but it was as if Rio was recognizing that they were still who they were, but life had also added complexities to their very essences. It was showing in the way she moved, still with fervor and purpose, but with an extra dose of attention and care.</p><p>It was nice, to physically feel that affection, but in those moments, Agatha needed more. It had been too long since they'd been like this and Agatha wanted Rio as close as was humanly possible.</p><p><em>"H-Harder, my love," </em>Agatha begged, pushing her hips back to meet the contact.</p><p>Rio heeded the call, a hand unhooking from Agatha's hip once more to reach up and secure a firm handful of hair in her grasp as her hips picked up their pace. She seemed to have shifted in just the right way that when their hips made full contact, Agatha felt her toes curl and a moan tore out of her, untamed in its volume. </p><p>In the throes of her task, Rio did not seem to gauge that volume either and persisted with the thrusts and impacts, nearly fevered in her work as her hand pulled on Agatha's hair again, causing her chin to tip toward the ceiling as she released another moan, still too wild in its delivery.</p><p>Somewhere mid-thrust of the most pleasurable one up to that point, there was a knock on the bedroom door. As Rio completed the thrust, she stilled and in the same motion, shoved Agatha down so that her face landed in the mattress in an attempt to stifle any sound she was bound to make. </p><p>"St-Stevie, baby?" Rio called, trying to keep her tone even in spite of where she currently was, hilt deep inside of Agatha.</p><p>"Dr. Rio? Are you okay? Is Mrs. Agatha okay?" came her little question. </p><p>Rio had locked the door on her way in, so she wasn't worried about that, but she was also hyper aware of the way Agatha was absolutely trembling through an orgasm below her.</p><p>"Yeah, sweetheart," Rio returned, her voice loud enough to be heard through the door. "Mrs. Agatha just stubbed her toe. She's okay though."</p><p>At this, Agatha tried to lift her head as if to argue but Rio was quick to push her back down, pressing their hips even tighter together despite the fact that there was no actual way they could get any nearer physically. Rio heard it, the deep rumble Agatha couldn't hold in, but it was so muffled that she knew it would not make it to the door.</p><p>"I'm gonna get her some ice for it in a few minutes. You can go back to bed, okay? I'll check in on you when I do."</p><p>There was a moment of silence but it was broken only for Rio as Agatha turned her head to press her cheek to the top of the duvet, heaving as she tried to catch her breath. </p><p>"Okay, Dr. Rio. See you in a few."</p><p>Rio stayed quiet as she listened to the sound of Stevie's footsteps fade down the hall until they were gone, padding over carpet instead. </p><p>Agatha could feel damn near every single move Rio made in those moments, every little flexing of muscles to any minute shift. They were so fucking close there was no way that they could have gotten any closer without actually melting into one another. Slowly, she felt Rio's hold at the base of her neck loosen and lift but she did not move immediately. Agatha's chest was still heaving with her effort to catch her breath, but even the gasp she managed when she felt Rio slide out of her was not enough oxygen.</p><p><em>"You really gotta work on that or we're not gonna be able to keep doing this," </em>Rio murmured at her as she shed the harness and let it drop over the edge of the bed. Once that task was managed, Rio moved to take hold of Agatha's leg, gently pulling on it and extending it so that she could lay on her stomach, managing to work through the process on the other leg as well.</p><p><em>"Orrrrr..." </em>Agatha groaned out in an attempt to find better words. <em>"You could just soundproof the door."</em></p><p>Rio moved to place herself on her side next to Agatha, fingertips tracing light lines up the trail of her spine as she leaned her head down to place a soft kiss to Agatha's shoulder.</p><p>
<em>"I'll put it on my honey-do list. But I'll do that after you let me cover you in kisses."</em>
</p><p><em>"Mmmmm, who would I be to decline such a request?" </em>Agatha shot back, her tone low and rich.</p><p>
<em>"Oh, my love, that wasn't a request."</em>
</p><p>Rio had done as she promised she would, taking all the time she wanted to cover nearly inch of Agatha's body in kisses, wise in her decisions to leave a few hickeys and bite marks in places that would hide from common view. After forcing a promise from Agatha to keep quiet, Rio had even buried her face between Agatha's legs for good measure, making sure she got an uninterrupted orgasm that time.</p><p>Although far later than had intended, Agatha had watched as Rio crawled out of bed and pulled on a tank top and shorts to get them a couple of bottles of water and check on Stevie. When she returned, she had delivered the news that Stevie had, thankfully, been asleep and with any luck, they could artfully dodge the incident with the explanation that was provided.</p><p>Agatha wasn't exactly the luckiest person in the world, though, as fate would have it.</p><p>She had been the first one up the following morning. After dressing herself in a pair of shorts and a baseball t-shirt, she made her way downstairs and started a pot of coffee for Rio before turning on the kettle for herself. She busied herself by pulling things out to make breakfast -- egg whites and toast; she was still a little too tired to manage much more -- and had been on her way to turning on the stove when the sounds of two pairs of feet on the stairs ventured to her ears.</p><p>She glanced up as they came into the kitchen, though the look on Rio's face tried to say something that didn't quite register before Stevie spoke.</p><p>"Is your toe okay, Mrs. Agatha?!" she questioned, concerned in her approach as she looked down at it. </p><p>"Yes, baby, my toe is okay," Agatha smoothed, fighting the absolutely smoldering heat that was climbing up her spine.</p><p>Rio had approached the counter and poured herself a cup of coffee. She blew on it for just a moment and raised it to take a sip at the exact same time Stevie spoke again.</p><p>"You stubbed it a lot last night, are you sure?" That heat was no longer climbing, it was all-consuming. That heat had Agatha about ten different shades of red and she did not look down at Stevie solely for the fact that she did not want to give herself away. </p><p>At the same time, Rio blew into her coffee and hissed at the burn she immediately felt from the splash against her face.</p><p>"I'm sure, sweet girl. Why don't you grab the orange juice out of the fridge so Dr. Rio can pour you a glass?" Ah, deflection. That would work, hopefully.</p><p>It seemed to, for that moment. Stevie did as she was told and fetched the juice, handing it over to Rio who poured her some of it, though Agatha had not missed the silent glances and smirks from her wife each time she looked in her direction. </p><p>Rio and Stevie had placed themselves at the table while Agatha finished preparing breakfast. She placed their plates down first and returned a moment later with her own, sitting next to Stevie. The way she had placed herself in the chair, though, had exposed enough of her marked skin that Stevie was able to see it, a little too close to her knee.</p><p>"Did you do that when you stubbed your toe, Mrs. Agatha?" Stevie inquired, honest eyes flickering up to Agatha's.</p><p>
<em>Damnit Rio.</em>
</p><p>"I sure did, baby."</p><p>"Maybe you should be more careful."</p><p>"She sure should," Rio added, though that hint of mockery in her voice did not miss Agatha who narrowed her eyes in return.</p><p>"I will certainly try," she responded, her sharp gaze upon Rio softening as it shifted to Stevie, her smile shifting into something warm by the time it landed, and that seemed to be good enough for Stevie who turned her attention back to her breakfast.</p><p>Rio had spent the next few nights after work making the modifications needed to seal up their bedroom door in an attempt to eliminate any part of it where slightly excessive sound might escape. It had been annoying for Agatha to watch Rio with that stupid backwards hat on that made her so fucking irresistible as she worked with her tools and clutched a pencil between clenched teeth every so often.</p><p>Still, Agatha had behaved and allowed her to complete the task without further complication.</p><p>It had turned out quite useful, in all actuality.</p><p>Evermore, the days continued to roll forward and the end of the month had rapidly approached. Halloween had fallen upon them and Agatha had found herself nearly breaking apart with excitement at the first offical holiday they got with Stevie.</p><p>Agatha had picked her up from school and took her straight home so that she could get her ready and dressed in her inflatable Bingo costume they had ordered a few weeks back.</p><p>Stevie had sat on the floor in front of Agatha as she brushed her hair back, pulling it into a ponytail at the back of her head, securing it snugly. It was supposed to be on the chilly side that night and despite Stevie's protests, Agatha had eventually coaxed her into putting a hoodie on before she put her inside the suit.</p><p>As Stevie stepped into the loose material, the front door unlocked and opened. Rio nearly stumbled in before shutting the door behind her so hard it nearly slammed.</p><p>"Agatha!" she amost shouted, her phone held up in her hand.</p><p>"Well, hi. Is everything alright?" she asked, the concern beginning to fill her face at her wife's disheveled demeanor.</p><p>Rio surged forward, turning her phone around to face Agatha.</p><p>"We have a date. A hearing date."</p><p>Agatha's eyes dropped to the screen to a text from Nicole.</p><p>"Hey Rio. This is the update we've all been waiting for. I got your hearing date a few minutes ago.</p><p>Be at the courthouse by 10:45 on November 16th. I'll meet you there. Congratulations!"</p><p>Agatha blinked at the screen and read the message again. And then she read it for a third time, then a fourth. </p><p>
<em>November 16th.</em>
</p><p>Stevie would become their daughter on November 16th. </p><p>A year ago, November 16th had been one of the worst days of Agatha's life.</p><p>This year, it was going to be the best.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>For months, Agatha had watched the days pass, racing through time with no finish line in sight. She had spent too many nights to count, awake in the dead of night as she listened to the sound of Rio's steady but slowed heartbeat, wondering if they would ever actual see it. She had spent too many days perched at the dining room table on calm weekend afternoons as she watched the two people she loved most in the world bask in the love they had formed for one another. </p><p>Too many silent mornings had she been the first awake, leaving her to slip out of bed and pace down the hallway. She would stand in Stevie's doorway, trying to will the universe into action while simultaneously hoping it would be the right kind of action,  the kind that would give all three of them what they so desperately wanted and needed.</p><p>Now, they could see it. It was right there, so close they could almost reach out and grab it. It was no longer months. It was nearing the point where it wasn't even weeks, only days.</p><p>Agatha tried desperately to not let herself get lost in the thoughts. That was difficult when every time she looked at Stevie, she felt so filled with love and emotion that it was bound to completely spill out of her in an overflow she could have never managed to contain. </p><p>Having that conversation with Stevie had been... shattering in the best ways. </p><p>She and Rio had placed themselves on the couch and Agatha had given her thigh a gentle pat in request that Stevie find her way there. Once she climbed up and put herself in Agatha's lap and sat perpendicular to it so that she could face Rio, she was actually the first to speak.</p><p>"Mrs. Agatha and I have something to tell you," Rio voiced, reaching a hand over to pick up Stevie's much smaller one.</p><p>Stevie's mind, however, was on a track miles away.</p><p>"We can have a dog now?!" she nearly squealed, her eyes wide and excited.</p><p>"Not quite," Rio returned through a chuckle that harmonized perfectly with Agatha's own soft laugh. "You know how Ms. Nikki has been checking in with us to make sure you're okay? And how we said that we might have to go see a judge?"</p><p>Stevie nodded her head immediately in confirmation, as if she had easily accessed such memories in that little mind of hers.</p><p>"You said that if we go see the judge, I get to stay here forever," Stevie relayed, spitting back almost the exact syntax that Rio had used. Agatha's hand had raised and a palm smoothed over the little girl's back, a positive physical reinforcement of the things she was about to learn.</p><p>"That's right," Rio said, looking her directly in the eye. "We are going to go see the judge in a couple of weeks. And when we do, he's going to sign a piece of paper that means that you are ours, that we will always take care of you and give you whatever you need. It means that Ms. Nikki won't ever have to come take you somewhere else again."</p><p>Agatha was honed in on Stevie's profile as she watched Rio intently, processing. She was thinking about it, considering what that meant. She was letting it roll around in that beautiful little brain of hers while she let herself understand and when she did, it was incredible.</p><p>"This gets to be my forever house?" Stevie asked and Agatha could hear it there, the blind hope that she herself had once felt about this day finally arriving for them.</p><p>Unable to help herself, Agatha shifted in a manner that allowed her to wrap her arms around Stevie's middle, hugging her tightly as her head came to rest on top of Stevie's.</p><p>"It sure does, sweet girl. We want you here with us forever," Agatha told her softly, hugging her a little closer to her chest despite the awkward positioning.</p><p>"And ever," Rio added, giving Stevie's hand the lightest squeeze.</p><p>That had been an emotional moment that both Agatha and Rio had needed to unpack and feel in the dark hours of the night, that small lamp from Agatha's old desk casting the faintest light as it sat in its new place on her nightstand.</p><p>There hadn't been much talking, but they had laid pressed together with Rio's head on Agatha's chest as Agatha traced lines and shapes so lightly over the smooth material of Rio's t-shirt for what felt like hours.</p><p>It was finality, but in a way Agatha had never felt it before.</p><p>A few days later, Stevie had been playing with a few of her toys in the living room on a Sunday afternoon as Agatha lazed on the couch with her glasses perched on her nose as she scrolled through assignments that needed grading.</p><p>Stevie had been in the process of returning her things to the basket where they belonged when she was finished them, but she stopped suddenly about a foot away from the basket, a doll in her hands. Agatha had caught it out of the corner of her eye from her spot on the couch and shifted her gaze to simply watch.</p><p>Slowly, Stevie turned to face her, looking a little surprised that Agatha was already looking at her. </p><p>"Mrs. Agatha?" she asked, her little face wrinkled with where her thoughts were taking her.</p><p>"Yes, Stevie?" Agatha responded, tilting her head curiously.</p><p>"Do I have to dress up to see the judge again?" </p><p>Agatha blinked at her, completely struck by the question and the explicit words Stevie had chosen. It was a stark reminder that this was a process for her, something she had probably done more than once. Granted, it was absolutely not for the same reasons, but Stevie had stepped into courtrooms before and had undoubtedly been told she had to present well.</p><p>Reaching forward to hook her fingers behind the screen, Agatha shut the laptop and shifted to place her feet on a ground. The empty space provided from moving her legs became the home for the laptop as she set it down on the cushion. She held her hands out, a beckoning for Stevie to come to her. When she understood and stepped forward, that doll still in her hands, Agatha lifted her up and pulled her into her lap.</p><p>Stevie turned her head and looked up at Agatha and once more, Agatha could have simply dissolved. These were big conversations that were spoken in such simplicities, but it left Agatha wondering if Stevie comprehended more than they'd ever really given her credit for.</p><p>"We should dress nice, yes," Agatha affirmed, reaching up with a couple of fingers to tuck some of Stevie's hair behind her ear. "But... I think that you should decide what you want to wear. It doesn't have to be something you already have. We can get you whatever you want."</p><p>The consideration was visible in Stevie's grey eyes, washing in and pulling out like the sea at high tide. </p><p>"I can wear the cool jacket and pants that match like Dr. Rio does when she goes special places?" she questioned and even though it was so casual and so logical for Stevie, it struck Agatha directly in the center of her chest. There had been two instances since she had been with them that Rio had needed to attend dinners for work and had always departed in a suit.</p><p>"You want to wear a suit?" Agatha posed, the smile on her face only a fraction of just how bright and beaming it actually wanted to be.</p><p>"Yeah!" she exclaimed back, the excitement filling her expression in an instant.</p><p>That smile remained on Agatha's face but grew a little more. </p><p>"What color would you want it to be?" came Agatha's next inquiry, her eyes searching Stevie's features for an answer even though she already had a pretty good idea.</p><p>"Can it be the same color as the purple flowers in the flower room?"</p><p>Although Agatha's lips turned down at the corners and the tears quickly began to prick at the backs of her eyes, the sheer happiness and emotion that consumed her at such a question felt like a blow, but only in the sense that it knocked the wind out of her. It was only such an impact because Agatha could clearly see it for what it was.</p><p>Stevie wanted pieces of the both of them to wear around her like armor. </p><p>She wanted a suit because of what it symbolized when it pertained to Rio, but she wanted it to be the color of Agatha's favorite flower in a room full of many other beautiful ones. She wanted to show the world who she was becoming now that she had them around.</p><p>Agatha was well aware that such a sentiment would never actually leave Stevie in admission simply because she was just too young to be able to break down those motivations. She didn't have the ability to truly grasp that she was choosing those things to show the world because of the love that had been poured into her for months, and that was okay.</p><p>Stevie didn't have to understand it for it to be monumentally beautiful.</p><p>So, Rio had made them an appointment at Beague's Tailoring for the following Friday after Stevie got out of school. </p><p>Rio had asked if Agatha had wanted to join them, and while Agatha knew she was genuine in extending the invitation, she also felt like it should be something between the two of them, just between Rio and Stevie. </p><p>Getting a fitted suit for any occasion was a big deal. </p><p>Rio had already informed Agatha that she was going to request it be just a little big to allow room for some growth and such a tender sentiment would surely leave its impact, even if Stevie would never realize it.</p><p>When the two of them came through the door around dinner time that Friday night, Agatha had been waiting with a prepared meal of spaghetti -- though Stevie's noodles had been separated and covered with butter and parmesan -- and salad, wearing a wide grin as she turned the burner off on the stove and strode to meet them.</p><p>"Mrs. Agatha! We found the color, the flower color!" Stevie almost shouted in her elation. "And a guy took the tape thing Dr. Rio uses when she builds stuff and told me I'm real tall!" </p><p>"You are! I swear you grow an inch every day!" Agatha told her, laughing the moment Stevie rushed forward to hug her legs, the excitement clearly brimming within her.</p><p>Agatha lifted her gaze from the top of Stevie's head and found her wife, grinning like an idiot.</p><p>"He said it will be ready by Wednesday, which would give him a couple of days if any alterations need to be made. All in all, she'll have it to wear on Monday." The sheer exuberance sparking inside of Rio was audible in her voice, crackling over her words in a way that filled Agatha from head to toe with an inexplicable warmth.</p><p>That warmth only seemed to burn a little hotter with the way Rio leaned forward, gracing her with a delicate kiss.</p><p>That Wednesday, when Rio had arrived home from work, she had come home a little later than normal and she was bearing the exact reason why in the form of a neat and flat white box. The moment she pushed the door shut behind her with her foot, Stevie's head lifted from her place in the living room and the light was immediate in every single inch of her body and facial features.</p><p>"Is that my --" she paused, her face scrunching slightly as she tried to recall the right word, " -- suit! Is that my suit, Dr. Rio?!" </p><p>Rio's laughter was like a comfort, a warm blanket on a cold night as it wrapped around Agatha snugly.</p><p>"It is," Rio confirmed, moving over to place herself on the couch. She set the box in her lap as both Stevie and Agatha joined her, respectively sitting on either side of her. Rio's grin was constant, not dimming in the slightest as Stevie practically vibrated with her anticipation beside her. "I haven't looked yet, so we all get to see it for the first time together."</p><p>Her head lifted and turned, meeting Agatha's loving gaze. The way Rio smiled in that moment, it landed somewhere deep within Agatha, somewhere that could still remember what it was like to not know that this was what her future would end up looking like. </p><p>It reminded her of that last November afternoon as she waited to cross the street. It reminded her of the way she had been jostled in place by the carelessness of someone who was distracted. It reminded her of the panic she'd felt as she'd watched a situation bound for imminent disaster, compelled to step in and stop it. It reminded her of snapdragons.</p><p>It reminded her of the very moment Rio had turned around and, before she could think to stop herself, she had smiled at Agatha.</p><p>They had met in that hospital, but their lives had <em>really</em> begun that day, in that moment on a random Boston street corner.</p><p>Every place Agatha had been, every pair of eyes she had ever looked in had paled in comparison to everything that Rio Vidal had been in that very moment.</p><p>Now, she had that feeling twice over when she looked into Stevie's eyes, too.</p><p>Rio looked back down to the box in front of her, palms sliding toward the edge of the lid that was closest to her stomach. Her thumbs tucked beneath the lip and lifted, revealing the gorgeous navy tissue paper that was wrapped around the suit inside. Rio leaned forward just enough to prop the lid against the front of the couch before immediately returning her attention to what was in front of them.</p><p>With a light touch, Rio pulled the tissue paper aside to reveal the violet colored suit jacket with the black collared shirt already in place inside of it. </p><p>Stevie's gasp happened on the spot and both of her hands flew to her cheeks as an indication of just how taken she was by the sight. Agatha's eyes were burning in a blink but she drew in a sobering breath as she watched their little girl in her fascination. </p><p>She lifted a small hand and started to reach, but she stopped and her gaze cut up to Rio, that need for permission that was so embedded within her winning out. Rio gave the smallest nod of encouragement, shifting the box over a little closer to her so she did not have to reach as far.</p><p>The moment Stevie's little fingers brushed over the material, her quiet hum hit the air, so tickled at the way it felt.</p><p><em>"It's so soft,"</em> she nearly whispered. She took only a moment longer to behold it before her head snapped up to look at the two of them, her youthful grin wide and bright. "I get to wear it soon?!" </p><p>"Yes, in five days. Mrs. Agatha and I have both taken the day off of work, so we're going to meet Ms. Nikki and together, we're all going to go talk to the judge. He's gonna ask you a couple of questions and then he'll sign that paper, and it will mean that the adoption is final." Rio's explanation was to the point, but there was a softness to her entire demeanor as she ventured a little deeper than they had before when it came to the experiences they were going to have that day.</p><p>"And then when we're done, we can go to Andy's for lunch. You can get the sandwich with all the bacon on it, if you want," Agatha added, her smile only growing when her eyes met Stevie's as she tore her eyes from Rio.</p><p>"Can I get a extra tomato too?" Stevie asked, clearly thrilled with the idea of food because it was something she knew, something that was familiar.</p><p>It didn't bother Agatha that it was where her focus went. It made sense. Stevie didn't know what other questions to ask about that day and so she defaulted to what she did know, and that was her favorite bacon and tomato sandwich at Agatha's favorite diner north of campus.</p><p>"You get whatever you want that day, baby," Agatha returned, her lips pushing up a little bit more in her adoration.</p><p>The squeals and giggles that Stevie let out then, and multiple times in the following twenty minutes as she proceeded to try on her suit had been a soundtrack to Agatha's day that she quickly realized was going to become the soundtrack to her life instead. </p><p>Stevie's laughs, her gasps, her bellows, her shouts, her cries. </p><p>They were the songs of Agatha's future. Some would feel good to experience and others would come with their own emotional impact. Whatever the melody, Agatha was thankful that she knew she would get to hear it for as long as Stevie was around. So... until she turned eighteen before it came a bit more intermittent, at the very least. </p><p>As the day count fell lower, both Agatha and Rio had started to lose sleep. It wasn't a fret or a worry; the thrill of what reality was going to hand them kept them wild and whipping in the night like a live wire that had hit the ground after being ripped from its pole. </p><p>They would whisper back and forth in their excitement. They would lay on their sides facing one another with their hands joined and fingers playing pointless wrestling games. They would giggle and fantasize about what the infinite days ahead could hold for their family.</p><p>It was a nightly routine.</p><p>With two nights left, Rio had taken up a new project at 11 pm on a Saturday night, likely only because she had already requested that Sunday off as well as the Monday after it.</p><p>She came out of the closet with a canvas in her hands and although Agatha had opened her mouth to say something smart, she realized that it was a bit smaller than the one that had once hung above the bed. Instead, as Rio placed it on the floor and Agatha shifted to peer over the edge of the bed, she realized it was blank.</p><p>"And what might that be for, my handsome artist?" Agatha delicately coaxed. </p><p>"You'll see," was all Rio provided in return as she set about her task after retrieving her charcoal set from her desk. She sat on the floor and glanced up at Agatha, a wide grin spreading across her lips. "Read your book, my love. It might put you to sleep this time."</p><p>Agatha's nose wrinkled in faux dissatisfaction but her smile won out a moment later as she did as she was told and placed herself back in her spot. She snuggled into her pillows and pulled her book into her lap, but she couldn't seem to keep her gaze from drifting, veering just over the lip on Rio's side of the bed. All she could see was the top portion of Rio's head with the way she was hunched, working away.</p><p>Every time Rio heard Agatha shift, though, she would straighten back up and toss a scolding glace in her direction, as if warning her to keep her eyes front.</p><p>"Okay, fine," Agatha would grumble each time, giving her hips a shake as she settled back into the mattress, a mockingly annoyed sigh leaving her lips in a huff.</p><p>Some point along the way, her book had dropped and her head tilted back as she slipped contentedly into slumber. The darkness was broken by flashes of dreams, ones she couldn't quite cling to, but impressed enough to leave her feeling the residual effects by the time Rio shook her awake.</p><p><em>"I'm sorry, you can totally go back to sleep, but... I just wanted to show you," </em>Rio nearly gushed. Agatha raised a hand, wiping at her face in an attempt to wake herself up a little more, though the effort was truly fruitless. She was still exhausted.</p><p>Slowly, she began to shift so that she could look at what Rio had been working on.</p><p>In the light of the lamp on the other side of Rio's nightstand, the canvas was perfectly displayed.</p><p>Impressed in charcoal was a spitting image of the wallpaper of Rio's phone.</p><p>Agatha was the one who had taken the picture as Stevie had sat on her lap at the dining room table, laughing maniacally as Rio reached around Agatha to tickle her side. In her efforts, Rio's face was directly next to Agatha's, their cheeks pressed together in a way that made them look misshapen. Their grins only added to that.</p><p><em>"I want to give it to Stevie to put in her room when we come home Monday..." </em>Rio trailed, shifting her weight back and forth as she toyed with her fingers in front of her. Was she nervous? Did she think Stevie would not like it? </p><p>Rio finally lifted her head to glance over at Agatha who was half hanging over the edge of the bed, her hair spilling over her shoulder.</p><p>Agatha's blue eyes lifted, too, falling into the familiar warmth of Rio's gaze.</p><p><em>"Honey, she's going to love it," </em>Agatha assured in a soft but honest murmur. Her hand raised again to rub at her eye as she tried and failed to stifle a yawn. <em>"How about you put it in the closet for now and come to bed? I'd very much like to snuggle with my wife before our daughter wakes us up in four hours."</em></p><p>Rio's shoulders dropped, the tension seeming to ease out of them the longer Agatha spoke. She studied her work a little longer before breathing a sigh of resignation. </p><p>As Rio went about cleaning up after herself and stowing the piece in the closet, Agatha readjusted in bed and turned down Rio's corner of the duvet so she could fit right in. When she returned from washing her hands, she did just that. Agatha had considered folding over her as she so commonly did, but Rio moved first.</p><p>The very second that Rio secured herself to Agatha's side, Agatha's arm wrapped around her, landing near her waist. Rio's head fell into its designated place on Agatha's chest and though they were both exhausted and still somehow buzzing, all felt right in the world.</p><p>All was right enough in those moments for them to find what little sleep they could manage.</p><p>The following day had been a lazy one. Truthfully, neither of them had gotten much sleep by the time Stevie was bounding in to wake them up. Her greeting had been the most beautiful thing to wake up to.</p><p>"There's one more finger left!" she had cried, waving a lone pointer finger from the edge of the bed as Agatha lifted her head to take in such a sight, a sleepy but smooth smile finding her.</p><p>"There sure is, baby," Agatha managed back groggily, moving in a way that caused Rio to shift and grumble, apparently not having woken all the way up yet.</p><p>"Can we make French toast for breakfast today?!" </p><p>A gentle chuckle passed through Agatha's lips as her head lulled back to the center of the pillow and her eyes slid shut. </p><p>"Absolutely."</p><p>And they had done just that.</p><p>Agatha had encouraged Rio to try and snooze a little longer while the two of them made breakfast and even though she had offered some form of protest, it had been weak in its delivery. It was something Agatha pointed out to press her instruction, which seemed to help her win her case.</p><p>Around the time the last slice was pulled off of the skillet and slid onto a plate, Rio shuffled in still wearing her charcoal smeared white tank top and a pair of dark green sleep shorts that hung down about mid-thigh. Her hair was a mess and Agatha could still clearly see that she was exhausted, but instead of pointing it out, she simply nodded her head in indication of the awaiting pot of coffee.</p><p>The softest 'thanks' rumbled out of Rio as she pulled down a mug and set about her work.</p><p>Once breakfast was finished and Agatha had cleaned up, the three of them had migrated to the game room where they spent a few hours playing Fortnite together. Those hours had been filled with too much laughter, too many shrieks, and so, so many cries of "Revive me!" They would take breaks, walk around the house and find small tasks that needed tending to, but it was an easy day over all.</p><p>Dinner had come and gone and they had all settled on the couch to watch a movie, though it was one they had watched before. Stevie had made the request as she placed herself dead center on the couch before Agatha or Rio had even crossed the living room.</p><p>"Can we watch Baymax?" she questioned, so soft and earnest.</p><p>"You don't want to watch a new one we haven't seen before?" Rio questioned as she sat to Stevie's left, casually draping her arm along the back of the couch.</p><p>"Nope, just wanna watch Baymax," Stevie answered honestly in the same moment Agatha scooped up the remote and planted herself on the opposite side Rio had taken.</p><p>"Works for us," Agatha agreed, leaning back to turn it on.</p><p>About forty minutes in, Stevie had fallen asleep. </p><p>Agatha had caught Rio's eye when she sensed her turn her head out of the corner of her own. For just a few moments, the loudest conversation was had without a single word spoken.</p><p>Rio was telling Agatha that this was it.</p><p>Agatha was telling Rio that she couldn't have been happier.</p><p>Every notion zipped back and forth between them through the softness of their gazes and the tender expressions on their faces.</p><p>By the time it was over, they knew they should put Stevie in bed and try to get a couple more hours of sleep for themselves. </p><p>Agatha had a plan for that, but priority one was tucking Stevie in one last night before her life forever changed irrevocably.</p><p>Rio had -- as she did almost every single time such a situation occurred -- propped Stevie up against her chest, those limp little arms doing nothing more than dangling through her slumber, and carried her up to her bedroom. Agatha had been merely a couple of steps behind them, following Rio into Stevie's bedroom.</p><p>Cradling Stevie's head, Rio tipped her forward and laid her on top of the mattress the moment Agatha had pulled the blankets back. As Rio tried to cover her back up, Stevie stirred.</p><p><em>"It's okay, sweetheart. We're just saying goodnight. Go back to sleep," </em>Rio urged, leaning down to place a kiss to Stevie's hairline.</p><p><em>"Dr. Rio?" </em>came Stevie's small and quiet voice.</p><p>
<em>"Yes, baby?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"How many fingers left?"</em>
</p><p>Rio's postured slackened so severely that Agatha nearly pressed forward to catch her, but she remained steady on her feet.</p><p><em>"When you open your eyes again, none. Get some sleep, kid," </em>Rio murmured at her, leaning forward to place a loving kiss to her head. She straightened back up and turned to face Agatha who already knew what she would see the moment she looked at Rio's face.</p><p>Rio was crying.</p><p>She wasn't upset.</p><p>She was fucking <em>ecstatic.</em></p><p>She'd gotten to say the one thing she had been aching to say for months. </p><p>While normally, Rio would simply pass by her with a quick kiss to retire to their bedroom, this night was different. Instead of veering to Agatha's left, Rio walked straight into her, those strong arms securing tightly around Agatha's middle as her head dropped to Agatha's shoulder. In the very next moment, Agatha's own arms encircled Rio around the shoulders, pulling her close.</p><p><em>"We did it. We really did it,"</em> Rio released in a shuddered whimper, her breath hot against the skin of Agatha's neck.</p><p><em>"You're right. We did. And I'm so proud of us," </em>Agatha returned in a gentle murmur as she turned her head enough that her lips landed just above Rio's eyebrow.</p><p>By the time Rio let her go and Agatha returned the gesture so she could shuffle to the side of Stevie's bed, Stevie had already fallen back asleep. Agatha's hand extended, fingertips skating through the soft brown hair there, pushing it away from that beautiful little face.</p><p>Her daughter's face.</p><p><em>Their</em> daughter's face.</p><p>She leaned down and pressed her lips to the center of Stevie's forehead, letting them linger there for a moment.</p><p>Something surprised her, though.</p><p>It was the feel of a lone tear as it clung to the edge of her jaw.</p><p>Agatha hadn't even realized she had shed it in the first place.</p><p>As she rose back to full height, she brushed it away with the back of her hand. The softest footfalls carried her down the hall to their bedroom, finding Rio already tucked beneath the duvet in her sleep clothes, though she was propped up slightly. The upward curl of her lips was instant the moment Agatha crossed the threshold and reached down to strip herself of her shirt to change into another. </p><p>Agatha could feel that gaze on her, following her as she dropped the shirt into the laundry basket and shucked her leggings to do the same with them. She could feel it as it traced up her back just before she disappeared into the closet. It was there again when she emerged, a tank top and pair of purple and black plaid pajama shorts hanging loosely from her frame. </p><p>The moment Agatha's knee hit the mattress at the foot of the bed, she also reached up to pull her hair over one shoulder in nothing more than an attempt to tame it. Once it was secured, she leaned forward to press her palms to the bed in a way that allowed her to crawl forward toward her wife. She shifted as she approached Rio, lifting a hand to land on the other side of Rio's hip, planting for only a moment so that she could lower herself down.</p><p>The way she settled, Agatha's head landed on Rio's stomach and while she was laying at a slight angle, there was quite a bit of overlap in regards to the positioning of their bodies. </p><p>Without a moment's hesitation, Rio's hand lifted and she began to run her fingers through Agatha's hair, drawing a soft but contented sigh from Agatha's lips in response.</p><p>She had started to slip, feeling the edges of sleep as they began to creep into her state of consciousness, but Rio's soft but cautious question batted it away as she released it into the night.</p><p>
<em>"Are you okay?"</em>
</p><p>Rio wasn't asking because of the way Agatha was laying on her. Rio wasn't asking because of the emotional moment they had shared in Stevie's bedroom. Agatha knew exactly why Rio was asking.</p><p>Rio was asking that question because, depending on what time it was, it had been sixteen years since the very day Agatha had lost her son.</p><p>Rio asked that question because she loved Agatha and while it had been so impossibly easy to get caught up in everything that was going on with Stevie, there was still this very prevalent fact of Agatha's life that came with the day ahead of them.</p><p>Agatha let it sit with her for a long while, trying to find the right words, the ones that would make the most sense and would also communicate exactly what she was feeling. It had taken her a long time, though she hadn't realized just how long, at least not until Rio's motions of running her fingers through Agatha's hair ceased.</p><p><em>"I am,"</em> Agatha answered almost immediately, silently thankful the moment Rio's touch resumed its work. <em>"I just..."</em> she trailed, though in those two words, the emotion bled out. <em>"I miss him every day. And I know that Stevie will never take his place, but I look at her... and I see the chance to do everything I never got to do with him. I see the opportunity to live through experiences I spent years and years depriving myself of because I had told myself it could only ever be him, could only ever be Nicky."</em></p><p>The touch in her hair lifted again, but it instead moved to cradle her head as it smoothed over her hair lovingly.</p><p><em>"So..."</em> Agatha exhaled, lifting her head just enough that she could peer up at her wife, the honesty like a beacon in those blue eyes as her chin rested on Rio's abdomen. <em>"Yes, I am okay. And I will be okay. And I will still be okay if I excuse myself to the bathroom at Andy's. I just might need a minute."</em></p><p>A soft chuckle sounded from Rio, one that could have almost been a whisper with how quiet it was, but Agatha understood it. The other woman knew her too well, knew that Agatha was absolutely never going to allow herself any form of a public breakdown, not in any instance, and so she let her have her claim that she would need the solitude that could be found in that diner bathroom.</p><p><em>"All you have to do is tell me what you need, at any point in the day," </em>Rio reminded her in a silky murmur as her hand moved so that her thumb could brush along the arch of Agatha's cheekbone. </p><p>
<em>"I know. But I already have what I need to get through it this time. I have the two of you."</em>
</p><p>Those dark eyes softened instantly and Rio's expression absolutely crumbled. It was clear that hearing Agatha make such a bold statement, especially in the context of that exact conversation, was probably something Rio had probably once told herself she would never hear. It was <em>so</em> obvious that being talked to like that, seeing the emotion behind those words as it clung to Agatha's expression had been a dream, one that Rio herself had managed to achieve. </p><p><em>"Come here," </em>Rio requested softly as she hooked her finger beneath Agatha's chin where it was resting in a cradle of smooth fabric and the muscle below it.</p><p>With care, Agatha heeded the call by pressing herself up, though she immediately slouched into Rio's body again, just higher up enough that she could take the kiss Rio wanted to impart upon her. </p><p>It was so <em>soft</em>, the way their lips simply brushed, unhurried and undemanding in their motions. There was no need for tongue, no requirement for teeth.</p><p>That kiss was the loudest declaration of love that either of them could manage right then, and it said everything it needed to. When Agatha pulled back, Rio's eyes were still closed and a serene smile was curling her lips. She parted them to speak and her eyes flickered open, staring straight into Agatha's as her pithy sentiment carried directly to Agatha's ears.</p><p>
<em>"I love you, Agatha Vidal."</em>
</p><p>Agatha didn't cry, but only because she kissed her wife again to temper the urge. Another moment passed before their lips parted, but Agatha did not go far, her own words whispered directly against Rio's lips.</p><p>
<em>"I love you too, Rio Vidal."</em>
</p><p>Offering another punctual kiss that was still impossibly tender, Agatha dropped her weight back toward the bed. Rio shifted enough to lay flat and Agatha fit herself snugly against her side, an arm hooked around her middle while her head landed on Rio's sternum just above her heart.</p><p>Not another word needed to be spoken and both of them knew it. All they had needed to do was close their eyes, so that was what they did.</p><p>When they opened them again, the day was finally upon them.</p><p>It was a day of remembrance for Agatha, but it was also a day of celebration for the Vidal family. Those two things could co-exist, as it turned out.</p><p>There was this beautifully controlled chaos once all three of them were awake. Agatha was in the shower while Rio and Stevie were on the other side of the house in the other bathroom so that Stevie could get a bath before Rio and Agatha could swap out and Agatha managed to get her dressed. </p><p>When Agatha had sat herself down at the end of Stevie's bed to braid her hair, Stevie had a request, one that softened Agatha exponentially despite her nerves.</p><p>"Mrs. Agatha, can you put a flower in my hair so that it matches my suit?" Stevie asked, still facing forward as Agatha worked methodically, already halfway down the back of Stevie's head with the French braid she was weaving. </p><p>"I can't braid it in," she informed her, but her hands stilled as she leaned forward over Stevie's shoulder to continue. "But, we can use one of your hair pins to put it on the side, if you want."</p><p>"Yes please," Stevie had answered. </p><p>Once her hair was finished, Agatha helped her pull the collared shirt over her head, buttoning it up before she twisted at the waist to pick up the suit jacket off of the bed. She used both hands to hold it up as she swung it behind Stevie so that she could slide her arms inside. The moment it settled, Agatha's fingers secured the open edges so that she could fasten the lone button that was just a little lower than it should be because of how the suit had been made to allow for a little bit of growth.</p><p>"When you sit down, you unbutton it, but I'll help remind you." Agatha reached to grab the bottom of the jacket, giving a gentle tug so it sat correctly on Stevie's small form. She leaned back to just take in the vision that was Stevie Noelle.</p><p>In just hours, she was going to be Stevie Noelle Vidal.</p><p>And she looked like the picture perfect example of a Vidal.</p><p>"Stevie..." Agatha managed, her throat feeling suddenly tight with the emotion that was churning inside of her, welling up higher and higher the more she took in the sight of Stevie in that suit with her hair braided and that bright look in her eyes. "You are always beautiful, but you look even more beautiful in that suit. It fits you very well."</p><p>"Thank you Mrs. Agatha," she replied with a genuine grin. "What are you gonna wear? You can't go in a t-shirt and those pants!" Her little hand extended to point at Agatha's sweatpants, accentuating the flourish with a bubbly giggle.</p><p>"You'll see in a couple of moments after --" Agatha was cut off by the appearance of Rio in the doorway. She was stood, leaning against the frame in that impeccably pressed black suit, the one that had the green trim around the edges. Her hand was out, palm up and her eyes were shimmering with sheer delight.</p><p>With the small sliver of the stem in the space between her first two fingers, Rio was holding a violet.</p><p>The instant she saw it, Stevie squealed.</p><p>"I thought that you might want something that matches your suit," Rio offered with a wide smile. "We can pin it to your jacket or --"</p><p>"She already asked if I could put one in her hair. So... thanks for saving me the trip," Agatha told her as she pushed herself to her feet and Rio met her half way to deliver the flower before retrieve a hair pin from Stevie's decorated jewelry box. It was plain silver, one of the only two plain ones Stevie had, but it was exactly the right piece. </p><p>Agatha dropped to a kneeling position as Rio handed over the pin and Agatha took the couple of seconds to secure the violet in place, just above Stevie's ear.</p><p>She had told herself that she was going to get back to her feet. That notion was shoved aside as she brought her hands up to cup both sides of Stevie's face in her palms as she simply beheld her, marveling at the absolute wonder she was, all three and a half feet of her. </p><p>"Can I tell you something that you might not know?" Agatha asked her, her voice low in tone but still rich in its warmth. When Stevie nodded, Agatha continued speaking, her thumbs brushing Stevie's cheeks below her eyes. "Do you know why Dr. Rio and I are adopting you today?"</p><p>Stevie shook her head this time. It was an honest answer to a very complex question and it was the one Agatha had expected, regardless.</p><p>"Because we love you. And I know that we haven't told you that because... Well, because we were scared to. We were afraid that if we told you and you had to leave us again, it would hurt you more than it would help you. But today, you become ours, and we become yours. And that means that we get to tell you that we love you every single time we want to."</p><p>Agatha was studying her, searching for any give that what she was saying might upset Stevie or push her toward an unintended direction, but all Agatha saw was Stevie's eyes darting as they began to develop a glassy film. </p><p>She didn't say it back, but she didn't need to. The way she rushed forward out of Agatha's hold and threw her arms around Agatha's neck said plenty. Agatha hugged her tightly for a long few moments before she let her go, trying to keep her own emotional tide at bay. </p><p>"Alright, alright," Agatha managed as she placed her hands to Stevie's shoulders and held her at arms length, meeting her gaze. "You and Dr. Rio go downstairs and get your shoes on. I'll be down in a minute."</p><p>Pushing herself to her feet again, Agatha turned in time to catch Rio's gaze for just a moment before she ushered Stevie toward the stairs so they could finish getting ready. </p><p>That look Rio had given her? </p><p>That look told her the loudest thing: <em>You are my whole world. Both of you.</em></p><p>It had only taken Agatha just a couple of minutes to dress herself and put on the appropriate jewelry. As she stepped in front of the mirror to survey herself, she finished clasping the gold chain over her sienna turtleneck. Once her arms dropped, they fell to the inside edges of her own suit jacket, cream in color. Unlike her wife and daughter, though, Agatha's ensemble was completely with a skirt of the same cream color.</p><p>After hooking a pair of heels with her fingers, she descended the stairs to the ground floor to bear witness to the sight of Rio knelt down, tugging Stevie's winter coat over her frame. </p><p>"Are we ready then, ladies?" Agatha offered as she hit the hardwood and continued toward them. </p><p>"All bundled!" Stevie announced the moment Rio finished zipping her coat, though she did not put the hood up for the sake of maintaining the integrity of the flower in Stevie's hair.</p><p>Agatha had taken the several seconds to put on her shoes at the same time Rio pulled on her own coat. As Agatha was moving to thread her arms through the sleeves of her own winter attire, Rio scooped the keys out of the bowl they were always kept in. Agatha had started to argue, but the look Rio immediately fixed onto her features caused her jaw to clamp shut, offering a gentle nod of understanding instead.</p><p>It probably <em>would </em>be better for Rio to drive, that day of all days.</p><p>After the twenty minute drive, they had unloaded from the car and began their journey to the front door of the courthouse, where an awaiting Nicole was standing outside with a huge grin on her face the moment she spotted them. Stevie was the first to speak as she surged forward, her thin hands slipping from both Agatha and Rio's grasps as she took off toward the only other familiar face that had been good to her.</p><p>"Ms. Nikki! Dr. Rio and Mrs. Agatha said that their house is my forever house starting today!" Stevie informed her upon her approach, though she halted just in front of the blonde who immediately dropped to squat in front of her.</p><p>"It is. We just have to go inside and talk to the judge for a couple of minutes and then when we leave, you'll go home with them and it could be a very long time until you and I see each other again. They're your <em>real</em> parents starting today." Nicole raised a cautious hand as she debated her next words. "And the reason they're your real parents is because <em>they chose you. </em> They <em>want</em> you. And they are going to give you <em>so </em>much love."</p><p>Stevie's response was stunningly honest.</p><p>"They already do that, Ms. Nikki."</p><p>Without warning, three pairs of eyes were instantly stinging at such a declaration.</p><p>"You're right, Stevie. They already do. And they always will."</p><p>When she had resumed her standing position, Nicole had turned to each of them and while Rio had offered her hand, Nicole easily pushed it aside to give her a firm hug so that she could pass on her quiet congratulations. When she moved to hug Agatha, she did the same thing, making it a point that they both knew how beautiful the entire thing had been to watch from her perspective.</p><p>The four of them had ventured inside to wait for only a few minutes until they were called into the courtroom. In a line, Agatha, Stevie, and Rio approached the elevated stand where the judge -- a middle-aged man who had a long but sharp nose that was a stark contrast to his soft brown eyes and greying hair -- sat, peering down at them.</p><p>He ran through his list of questions, all of which Stevie had answered with 'yes, sir's or 'no, sir's and then gave a gentle probing to Nicole as well. She had done nothing other than sing their praises, recounting every single moment she had known that this was what was meant to be. </p><p>Satisfied, the judge then pulled a few papers before him and began to sign them, one after another until he had completed the small stack and scooped them up to hand them off to the notary. The moment she was finished applying the official seals, Nicole stepped forward to take them so she could pass them along.</p><p>The moment those papers landed in Agatha's hand, the judge spoke.</p><p>"I congratulate the three of you. May your lives as The Vidal Family prosper and offer fulfillment."</p><p>And just like that, it was done.</p><p>He had said it best.</p><p>
<em>The Vidal Family.</em>
</p><p>On November 16th, Agatha once lost her only family. </p><p>Now, on November 16th, Agatha had solidified an even bigger one.</p><p>For as much as she was capable of, Stevie seemed to get it. She seemed to understand, at least at the most basic level, that everything they had all been telling her was actually true. She didn't have to face another home full of kids that picked on her because of her size. She didn't have to go to a school where no one cared enough to look out for her. She never had to have another foster parent that contained a flagrant disregard for her well-being. </p><p>Stevie was realizing that the life she'd known before meeting Agatha and Rio was now nothing more than a variety of memories, even if they were bad. They never had to be her present, or her future, ever again.</p><p>Nicole did not step away, though. Instead, she asked for Agatha's phone. It took Agatha only a moment to understand the request and she removed it from the bosom pocket of her suit jacket, opening the camera before she handed it over to Nicole. The other woman stepped back and instructed the three of them to pose.</p><p>Rio was quick as she snapped down to scoop Stevie into her arms, planting her on her hip so that when Agatha stepped in to close any empty space, they were all about level in terms of eye line. </p><p>Agatha wouldn't know it until she had a chance to look at the several pictures Nicole took later on, but in that moment the smiles the trio were wearing could have ended an Antarctic night in a flash.</p><p>The goodbye with Nicole outside of the courthouse had gone about as Agatha had assumed it might. Both Rio and Nicole had cried almost instantly, but Agatha had <em>somehow</em> managed to keep her placid facade up while in the presence of the general public. If Agatha was going to lose it over this, it was not going to be pretty and she didn't need a bunch of strangers staring at her over it. </p><p>It had been even harder to maintain when she heard Rio tell Nicole that after some time and Stevie had fully integrated, they would love to keep her company. It was something they had both discussed, but seeing Nicole's reaction at being offered the invitation of friendship had been another emotional moment that Agatha had felt the need to bury in the moment so she could process it later.</p><p>They had departed the courthouse and headed straight for Andy's Diner, a general air of elation seeming to follow them wherever it was they went. They'd ordered their food -- a BLT with an extra tomato for Stevie, a veggie melt for Rio, and the chicken salad for Agatha -- and a round of Cokes, with vanilla syrup added to Stevie and Rio's in a treat.</p><p>Sitting there, laughing and talking and listening to Stevie tell knock-knock jokes that made absolutely no sense, it was surreal to realize that they were actively experiencing their first outing as a true, legalized family. It was their first, but it was nowhere near their last. They had an entire lifetime filled with first moments, first experiences, first emotions ahead of them and Agatha was absolutely enthralled with the idea that she got to be there for every single one and <em>no one</em> could take that away from her.</p><p>When Rio had been signing the check, the waitress had complimented their attire, but before either of the women could offer any form of gratitude, Stevie spoke first.</p><p>"We had to look nice so they could adopt me!" she volunteered easily, leaning forward in a way that caused her chest to press to the edge of the table.</p><p>As Agatha's eyes lifted to the waitress, she could see the softness there and the woman offered a small smile and nod of her head, one that almost had an essence of understanding.</p><p>Stevie knew. Undoubtedly, Stevie knew. And to announce it with such price?</p><p>Stevie was happy with it. </p><p>In fact, she was very clearly thrilled.</p><p>That general aura of elation surrounded them even as they spilled into the house, laughing at the way Rio had run straight into the door when she'd accidentally turned the key the wrong way and left it locked but still tried to open it anyway. As they shed their coats and kicked their shoes off, the moment Rio had been waiting for had finally arrived.</p><p>Agatha could see it on her face, even before she spoke. Rio was giddy for what was about to transpire and it showed in the way she lifted Stevie off her feet and secured her on her hip, heading straight for the stairs.</p><p>"Dr. Rio!" she shrieked through her giggles. "Where are we going?!"</p><p>"We have a present for you!" Rio informed her, making her way up the stairs as she pinched and prodded Stevie's tummy for no other reason than to hear that sweet, sweet melody of her giggles as it bounced off every surface in the stairwell.</p><p>Agatha finished hanging up the coats and was quick to climb the stairs, too. As she made it to their bedroom, Rio was setting Stevie on the edge of the bed so that she could disappear into the closet to retrieve the gift. Stevie's eyes swept to Agatha in her excitement.</p><p>"Do you know what it is, Mrs. Agatha?! Is it a puppy?!"</p><p>Agatha laughed, a full and hearty laugh that formed in her belly. </p><p>"Not yet, baby. We'll get there some day, I promise." </p><p>There was the slightest twitch of Stevie's lips, but before it could go much further, Rio emerged with the canvas, holding the marked side toward herself to prolong the reveal a little bit longer. </p><p>"What is that, Dr. Rio?!" Stevie pressed, leaning forward as if it might give her x-ray vision to see through to the other side. </p><p>"This is something I did for you. If you like it, we can hang it in your room." After a beat, Rio shifted the piece in her hands so that she could turn it around to display the image she had imbued upon it. The image of the three of them in the throes of the happiness they now got to experience forever, no matter how subjective that word could actually be.</p><p>"Dr. Rio! That's us!" she nearly cried as she leapt off of the bed, pushing forward as quick as she could without running straight into the canvas. She beheld it, studied it, looked at every little detail. Then, her eyes lifted to Rio. "You drew this for me?"</p><p>Agatha had just been watching, but Stevie's words reached right into the depths of Agatha's mind and plucked a memory, dragging it with haste to the front. It was demanding of her attention, her recollection. </p><p>The first night Agatha had slept in that very home, Rio had drawn a picture for her, too. </p><p>"I did."</p><p>"I love it, Dr. Rio. Thank you."</p><p>Yet again, Agatha could feel the emotion building but she used internal brute force to shove it back down. </p><p>Now, she would justify choking those feelings down by claiming that Stevie didn't need to see her like that. It would only confuse her and she simply wanted to live in the little bubble of joy that surrounded their home. Maybe it was true, maybe it wasn't. Either way, Agatha was not ready for her breakdown yet.</p><p>After changing from their formal attire, they had all suited up in their sweatpants and comfortable t-shirts before they migrated to the game room for another first.</p><p>Their first game of Fortnite as a family. Maybe it wasn't much different than all the one's they had played time and time before, but it just <em>felt </em>different. Stevie's over-excited yelps when she would get nicked by another player and her giggled cries for help when she went down seemed to echo in a new way. The way Rio would urgently demand Stevie meet them at the edge of Nightshift Forest, thick with the request she not die on the way made Agatha laugh in a way she wasn't sure she had ever laughed before. </p><p>Maybe it was all the same in terms of actual events and how they happened, but the new frame of mind they had all been graced with gave it a face-lift, a new appearance. It was one that Agatha found solace in, one she wanted to hold onto.</p><p>Stevie's selection for dinner that night had been pizza and neither of them were surprised nor did they have any objections. </p><p>Their dinner had been just as light as their lunch, heavy with laughter and jokes and little stories.</p><p>Despite the fact that they'd had such a big day, Stevie had school the next day and both Agatha and Rio had to work, too. Because of those unfortunate facts, they had finished their food and retired to the living room to watch Lilo and Stitch. That one, for fitting reasons, had been Agatha's choice.</p><p>Stevie had managed to stay awake through the whole movie, snuggled between them though she was turned more toward Agatha, her head tilting to rest against Agatha's side.</p><p>Trying to get her to go to bed that night had been a little bit of a struggle. She was clearly still wound up from the excitement of the day and just wanted more of their time. Agatha had tried to assure her, as she pulled the blanket up Stevie's chest, that they had all the time in the world. The tears started anyway.</p><p>"Baby, why are you crying?" Agatha asked from where she sat on the edge of the bed, reaching forward to brush Stevie's tears off of the corner of her eye.</p><p>"Because it was a good day and I don't want it to be over," Stevie answered in a whimper.</p><p>Although she tried to fight it, Agatha couldn't help but breathe the softest laugh.</p><p>"It's okay that it's over. You know why? Because we get to have another good day tomorrow. And the day after that. Even the day after that one. We get to keep having good days because you're <em>home.</em> We're going to find one reason every day that it's a good day from here on out. I promise." At such a a statement, Agatha lifted her hand and extended a pinky finger. Stevie met it instantly by hooking her own around it tightly.</p><p>"You can't break a pinky promise, Mrs. Agatha," Stevie advised and Agatha gave a firm nod of understanding.</p><p>"I absolutely won't. So... Do you think maybe you and Scratchy can catch a few z's now that you know tomorrow is going to be a good day, too?" Agatha posed softly.</p><p>Stevie's nod, followed by an involuntary yawn, told her all she needed to know.</p><p>Agatha leaned over her, pressing her lips to Stevie's forehead in a sweet kiss.</p><p>
<em>"I love you, Stevie. Sweet dreams, okay?"</em>
</p><p>She started to pull away but was stunned to stillness the exact moment that both of Stevie's small and clammy palms landed on her cheeks. Mimicking Agatha's behavior, Stevie pulled Agatha's face where she needed it so that she could return the forehead kiss, even though the one she delivered was more of a peck than anything else.</p><p>It didn't matter.</p><p>It could have been the lightest gracing and Agatha wouldn't have cared. It wasn't about the contact.</p><p>It was about the intent. </p><p>Agatha's eyes shut immediately and she fought to keep her expression from completely shattering there in Stevie's hold.</p><p><em>"Sweet dreams, Mrs. Agatha," </em>Stevie whispered right before she let go of Agatha's face and rolled over on her side, pulling her stuffed rabbit to her chest.</p><p>Crawling into bed that night, Rio had been metaphorically waving  the green flag that signaled Agatha had reached the point where she could finally let it go.</p><p>And she had.</p><p>Agatha had sobbed, shaking and trembling as Rio held her tightly to her chest and just let her feel it.</p><p>She cried for Nicky and how much she missed him.</p><p>She cried for herself and just how much she had accomplished in only a year.</p><p>She cried for Rio and how no other human in the world would ever have been capable of loving her the way Rio did.</p><p>She cried for Stevie because she had finally reached a point in her young life where her suffering was finally over.</p><p>Agatha cried because her life had become something she had never thought it could be. She couldn't have even wished for this. No, what she'd been given had been obtained through her own effort. She had fought herself on letting Rio in. She had fought herself on giving up the control she had always coveted so deeply. She had fought herself on accepting the idea that she could ever be a mother again.</p><p>She had put up all of those battles and came out victorious on every single one.</p><p>Rio was her wife. Rio held Agatha's essence in the palm of her caring and gentle hand. Agatha was a mother again.</p><p>The tears had only stopped because she had fallen asleep, still held tightly to the chest of the woman who would love her the most forever and for always.</p><p>Family life felt... beautiful. Those first few weeks, minus a couple of typical tantrums for over arbitrary things, almost felt even more surreal in they way they felt like little more than living in a dream. </p><p>They spent their first Thanksgiving together. And then, came Christmas.</p><p>They had most definitely spent entirely too much money and had bought far too many gifts for Stevie, but getting to see the way she had lit up even brighter than the tree her presents were under? It had been worth every single penny. </p><p>She had spent days gushing about the Pikachu joy cons she'd gotten for her Switch, wore her Muffin shirt until the point that Agatha had assured her she could have it back as soon as she was done washing it, and had carried around the miniature version of the backpack Rio often took to work with her everywhere they went. She had appreciated the other toys, but those three things had been her favorites.</p><p>Two weeks after the new year came another first.</p><p>Stevie's first birthday as a Vidal. </p><p>They had still gotten her a few gifts, but after the over abundance of them she had acquired at Christmas, they hadn't felt the need to go overboard again. Still, she had been thrilled and thankful for the things she had received. </p><p>Per her request, they had gotten an ice cream cake to celebrate. Once Rio had pushed in the candle that was shaped like the number '6,' she lit it and stepped back as they sang a round of Happy Birthday while Stevie covered her mouth and giggled.</p><p>They finished and she leaned forward, blowing out the candle.</p><p>"Did you make a wish, baby?" Agatha asked with a grin.</p><p>It was a grin that disappeared in the next moment, folding into a puzzled expression the moment Stevie's lone word hit her ears.</p><p>"No."</p><p>No?</p><p>What kind of kid didn't make a birthday wish?</p><p>Rio was quick to respond, which was good because Agatha suddenly felt... verklempt. </p><p>"How come?" she posed curiously, leaning a little toward their daughter.</p><p>"I didn't need to," Stevie offered with a shrug as she reached forward to take a swipe of ice cream from the edge of the cake with her finger, immediately placing it in her mouth. When she removed it, her eyes lifted back up to Rio. "I was wishing for a family. I got it now, so I don't need to keep wishing."</p><p>So simple. So obvious. So, so true.</p><p>"Fair enough, sweet pea," Rio told her, both mussing her hair and placing a kiss to the side of her head before she got to her feet to collect a few plates that they could eat their ice cream cake off of.</p><p>Winter felt a lot less cold that year, even if the bite of it had been the worst it was in years that February. The wind could whip, the snow could fall, the ice could sheet the streets and it would have never eroded the warmth Agatha had been living in for months. </p><p>It was a Monday morning and the temperatures had dropped into the negatives, but she'd managed to avoid feeling it too harshly by the time she'd gotten into her lecture hall and shed her protective wear so that she could prep for class.</p><p>As her students began to pour in, she checked her phone one last time to see if Rio had texted her. She'd taken the day off because Stevie was out of school for teacher in-service and it was just easier than trying to find a sitter, which was something they weren't quite ready for yet. Latchkey was one thing because that was a program ran by the school, but actually finding a babysitter that could understand and meet the specific and special needs that Stevie could sometimes have? It would be a process and something they did not think they should undertake at that point.</p><p>Imagine Agatha's surprise, then, when an hour into her lecture, the door opened and Rio and Stevie came bustling through it. The moment Agatha's eyes met Rio's from behind her glasses, she could see the apologetic expression she was wearing. Something else she was wearing? Her scrubs.</p><p>Instantly, Agatha held up a finger toward her students that requested a brief pause and paced over to her wife, who was clutching Stevie's hand in her own. </p><p><em>"I'm so sorry. Johan is sick and no one else can cover. I should be done no later than six but I didn't know what to do with her." </em>Rio was trying to be quiet but she had not realized that Agatha did not care. This year's students were well aware of her maritial status and saw one of the photos Nicole had taken that day at the courthouse every time she hooked up her laptop.</p><p><em>"Hey, it's okay. She can hang out here. I've got about ninety minutes left and I can skip office hours today. Give me that and go on. Go save lives." </em>Agatha's grin was instant and Rio complied immediately, slipping the bag full of Stevie's things off of her shoulder before she forked it over to Agatha. At the same time, she leaned in and pressed a kiss to Agatha's cheek.</p><p>Before she could get even an inch away, Agatha's head turned just enough so that she could return the favor. The move elicited a soft and breathy laugh from Rio.</p><p><em>"I love you, Agatha," </em>Rio murmured, her smile ringing clear in her words.</p><p>
<em>"I love you too, Rio. Have a good day at work." </em>
</p><p>Rio's gaze dropped down to Stevie and she offered a true grin and thumbs up. "And I love you, too, kid. Behave, yeah? Maybe I'll bring home some mango fruit bars when I come home."</p><p>Stevie offered a nod, followed by a sweet sentiment of her own.</p><p>"Have a good day at work!"</p><p>The tightest yet softest smiles were exchanged between the couple and Rio departed to find her way to work. And there stood Agatha and Stevie with about forty pairs of eyes on them. </p><p>Agatha simply ignored it. </p><p>"Let's get you situated, baby," Agatha offered, reaching down to take Stevie's hand. As they reached the main floor, Agatha was quickly assessing her options. She could put Stevie in her office, but she didn't like that. Her best bet was going to be putting her at the desk in the middle of the floor where she could keep an eye on her.</p><p>If that was going to be the case, she supposed there was an introduction to be made.</p><p>She walked Stevie over to her desk and pulled the chair back, indicating that she could climb into it. Once she was seated, Agatha set the backpack on the desk but then lifted her head to take in the sight of all of her students just... watching. They weren't talking or gossiping. They were just observing. </p><p>"My wife got called into work, so we have a guest observer for this last bit today," Agatha informed them as she unzipped the bag and pulled out a coloring book and the box of crayons Rio had stowed inside. She was in the process of laying the items out as she continued speaking. "Class, this is my daughter Stevie. Stevie, these are my students that I have told you about."</p><p>Stevie's bright grey eyes lifted and took in the sea of faces before her. Her reaction was almost instant.</p><p>Her hand shot up and waved enthusiastically in the air.</p><p>"Hi guys!" she chirped.</p><p>An instant symphony of <em>Awwww's </em>and <em>Oh my GODs</em> filled the hall and Agatha could not have even tried to temper the wild grin that burned its way across her face.</p><p>In the next instant, the return came. It wasn't quite a harmony and some words from some students fell out of sync with the others, but the intent was still there.</p><p>"Hi, Stevie!"</p><p>Stevie fell prey to giggles immediately, clearly loving the attention. Agatha pulled out a granola bar and a juice pouch from the bag before finally setting it on the floor behind the desk. She placed the items on the desk but then moved to squat down so that she could be closer to Stevie so that she did not have to be so volumous in her delivery.</p><p>
<em>"I do have to finish working, so if you can sit here and color for a little bit, we can stop on the way home and get a big Resse's cup. If you need anything, you just let me know, okay?"</em>
</p><p>Stevie had already picked up a crayon and began to color the page open in front of her.</p><p>Her response was so effortless, <em>so goddamn easy.</em></p><p>"I'm okay, mom. I got my snacks and my crayons and my juice."</p><p>Agatha's heart stopped.</p><p>She forgot about class.</p><p>She forgot about her students.</p><p>She forgot about the year of struggles they had endured to exist in that moment.</p><p>
<em>Mom.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stevie had just called her 'mom.'</em>
</p><p>To hide her emotion both from Stevie and her students, Agatha's head dropped and she took several long moments to blink back the tears that were fighting to spill out of her eyes. When she was certain she had reached a point where she could manage the rest of her lecture -- somehow, by some goddamn miracle -- she reached up to the far side of Stevie's head and pulled it toward her enough that she could meet it to place a kiss in her hair.</p><p>Right. Back to business.</p><p>Back to lecturing her students about <em>critical fucking thinking.</em></p><p>Getting through that last eighty minutes had felt like Agatha was absolutely fighting for her life. Every time she got the chance, her eyes would drift to Stevie. Her daughter. Her daughter that had just called her 'mom' for the first time in the almost twelve months they had known each other. </p><p>Agatha was losing her shit internally and yet, still managed to finish her lecture, feeling like she'd run a damn marathon by the time the hall was emptying out and her students were calling their goodbyes to Stevie who would wave a loose hand in return.</p><p>The moment Agatha had informed Stevie that they could go home, she hopped out of the chair and picked up her trash, throwing it into the bin next to the desk. Agatha closed up the plastic box full of crayons and stowed it in the bag along with the coloring book. </p><p>They suited up in their coats and Agatha had decided on carrying Stevie to the car, knowing it was a bit of a trek for her little legs. </p><p>She had done as she had promised and stopped at a gas station so they could run in and grab Stevie her reward as well as a couple of sodas as a treat, too. Agatha even snagged a cream soda for Rio. She didn't drink a lot of soda, but when she did, that was always her choice.</p><p>When she climbed into the car, her phone dinged with a message notification from Rio.</p><p>
<em>"Another attending finally answered his phone. I'm almost home. I'm going to shower real fast. Let me know when you're almost home. I love you both."</em>
</p><p>Agatha grinned down at her phone. That was actually perfect because she had no clue how she was going to find a way to keep such massive news to herself if Rio was going to be coming home later. </p><p>
<em>"We're leaving Belmont now. Be home in a few. We love you."</em>
</p><p>Agatha had only been on the road for about a minute when something in the mirror caught her eye. Stevie's legs were kicking but she was staring out the window with a strange expression on her face. </p><p>"Baby? You okay back there?" Agatha prodded in a soft but curious croon.</p><p>"Yeah. Just thinkin'," Stevie responded, but Agatha felt the need to press.</p><p>"Whatcha thinkin' about?"</p><p>Agatha stole another glance in time to see Stevie's lips twist in consideration as she tried to uncover the best way to phrase what was going on in that little brain of hers.</p><p>"If you're mom... What does that make Dr. Rio?"</p><p>Okay, so maybe the shock would wear off with the frequency of use, but hearing it the second time didn't leave Agatha fairing much better than it had the first. This time, she was behind the wheel of a moving vehicle and she absolutely had to channel her focus into keeping it on the road. At the same time, she knew she had an answer to provide.</p><p>She took her own couple of moments to consider that answer before she found it. </p><p>"You can call her whatever you want, sweet pea, but I think if you wanted to, she might really like it if you called her 'mama.'"</p><p>Stevie's response was a silent one in the form of a nod as her eyes stayed fixed on the views outside of the window. It had only taken Agatha a couple more minutes before she had pulled into the drive next to the condo and put the car in park. She was still nearly trembling with her excitement and thrill at what might possibly be about to unfold, but she was doing her best to keep it in check. </p><p>Agatha had not informed Stevie that Rio had gotten to come home early. Agatha was also not entirely sure that Stevie even realized that was why she had been dropped off at the college.</p><p>That much was clear the moment Stevie bounded inside as soon as the door swung open, her call loud and boisterous.</p><p>"Mama! Are you home!? We got you a soda!"</p><p>Three seconds passed and very faintly, Agatha could hear a <em>thump</em> from two stories overhead. She almost could have sworn she heard the swear that followed, but Stevie didn't and that was the important part. </p><p>It took only another minute before the scrambling sounds of Rio's feet on the stairs were audible at the base of them. The moment she came into view, Stevie rushed forward, cradling the bottle of cream soda in her hands.</p><p>"Mama! We got you this at the store! Mom got me a big Resee's cause I was good while she talked a lot."</p><p>As Rio came off of the steps, Agatha was almost certain her knees were going to give out. Perhaps it was a good thing that she had an iron grip on the railing to her right. There were too many emotions in those eyes for Agatha to name just one, but as Rio looked down at Stevie, the love was so clearly there.</p><p>She bent at the waist and pulled Stevie into her arms, hugging her tight for just a moment.</p><p>"You're the best, kid."</p><p>The night had wound down. They had devoured a meal of mac and cheese, green beans and nuggets and afterward had decided on a couple of rounds of Fortnite in lieu of a movie that night. </p><p>After two consecutive wins, they made the executive decision to call it and declare that it was time for bed.</p><p>For once, Stevie offered no protest. She didn't ask for one more game, didn't whine or pout. She simply put her joy cons back onto her Switch where it sat in her charger and reached for Agatha's hand so that they could go to bed.</p><p>Once she was in her pajamas and tucked into the warmth of her comforter, both Agatha and Rio had placed themselves on the edge of the bed so they could say their goodnights. However, Stevie was not ready to sleep, despite the ease with which she had caved when it came to turning off the game.</p><p>"We didn't watch a movie," Stevie pointed out, completely ignoring the deal they had made earlier in the night. </p><p>"Because we played Fortnite instead," Agatha reminded her, but this meant nothing.</p><p>"I think we should still watch a movie." It was worded like an opinion, but Stevie stated it as though it were fact.</p><p>"You have school tomorrow, Stevie," Rio told her, her voice gentle but a little hardened in the acknowledgement.</p><p>"I know but... What if we lay in your big bed and when I get tired, I can just sleep with you."</p><p>She had dubbed them with their own titles that day. As Agatha glanced over her shoulder at Rio, they both already knew what the answer was going to be.</p><p>"Alright," Agatha conceded and Stevie shot straight up into a sitting position in her excitement. </p><p>"Really?!" </p><p>Rio nodded and they both got to their feet. Agatha stepped back and Rio swooped in, pulling Stevie to her chest. Like second nature, Stevie's legs locked around Rio's sides and her arms wrapped around her neck. As Rio started the trek to their room, Agatha reached down and grabbed Scratchy for good measure.</p><p>They had settled into the mattress and Agatha put on Tangled, much to Stevie's delight. </p><p>There in that bed sat their entire lives.</p><p>Watching that movie, they were a family.</p><p>Stevie and her parents.</p><p>Agatha had been entirely convinced that the day had reached its peak, that it was never going to get any better than it was in that moment with she and Rio sandwiching their little girl between them.</p><p>Stevie had to go and prove her wrong with absolutely unintentional finesse.</p><p>She had grown tired and let off a yawn that signaled she was close to falling asleep. Then, she spoke.</p><p><em>"I love you, moms," </em>she mused in a sleepy murmur.</p><p>Agatha and Rio locked eyes above her head, the tears instant in both pairs as mirrored images of tightly pressed lips and choked emotions appeared between them. They were both aware, though, that they were wasting precious time.</p><p>In unison, their heads dipped and they kissed opposite sides of Stevie's head, releasing a soft harmony in return.</p><p>
<em>"We love you too, baby."</em>
</p><p>They shifted back into their previous positions, but their eyes met again and Rio was the first to make a statement, even if it was through the way she only mouthed the words.</p><p>
<em>'I love you.'</em>
</p><p>Agatha's lips pulled into a truly peaceful and serene smile just before she returned the silent sentiment.</p><p>
<em>'I love you too.'</em>
</p><p>As Agatha settled back into the pillows, she was struck with a thought:</p><p>Oh, what it was to be loved by a Vidal woman.</p><p>And then another thought hit with a little more impact:</p><p>She, too, was a Vidal woman. </p><p>As a result, she had <em>finally</em> learned what it meant to love herself.</p><p> </p>

*****</em>
</p><p>
<b>November 16th.<br/>
1 year after Stevie's adoption.<br/>
2 years after Agatha's accident.<br/>
</b>
</p><p>The moment Agatha put the car in park in the drive next to their home, she slumped back into the seat to steady herself with a long breath.</p><p>Since she had woken up that morning, it felt like her foot had been pressed to the floor, the gas pumping as she sped through the day. Well, it hadn't helped that Rio had assisted in applying a little pressure with the way Agatha had woken up well before her alarm to the feeling of her wife's lips on the portion of skin she had exposed by pushing Agatha's shirt out of her way.</p><p>The sun hadn't even been up and true to form, they'd both been gifted a delightful orgasm from the other to appropriately start their day, the day they had met two years prior. The day, a year ago, that they had adopted their daughter.</p><p>After a quick shower, they had gotten dressed before preparing Stevie for school. Agatha had dropped her off and began her own day, filled with both a lecture and a staff meeting that she did not exactly want to attend. Nothing said in them ever applied to what she was doing and more often than not, she had to sit idly for twenty minutes while her peers conveyed 'problems' that seemed easily solvable with common sense. Agatha had begun to wonder if they should have started calling it 'uncommon sense' instead. </p><p>The timing of it all seemed to work out for her, regardless. She would have time to get home and get a shower and a change of clothes before she had to go pick up Stevie from latchkey and they would go pick up dinner to celebrate the two occasions that fell on that day. Agatha had planned on getting herself and Rio their favorites from Lulu Green and Stevie had requested the big chicken strips from Butterbird. </p><p>Unbeknownst to Stevie, Agatha had also ordered a cookie cake for what Stevie had been hyping up as her 'gotcha day.' She had heard it used once, asked what it meant, and when she had been informed she had used it at least twenty times in the last week alone.</p><p>
<em>"Is my 'gotcha day' coming up soon?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I get the big chicken for my 'gotcha day?'"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Do you and mama have a 'gotcha day?'"</em>
</p><p>The last one had garnered a little more of an in-depth answer.</p><p>"We do," Agatha had told her, running her fingers through Stevie's smooth hair. "It's the same as yours, just the year before. I was in an accident and, like you, mama was the one who took care of me."</p><p>Stevie's eyes had grown a bit at this new piece of information. They always answered her questions when she asked them, but they had never volunteered too much information to avoid overwhelming her. Letting her learn at her own pace was better suited to her development, and they had both been aware of it.</p><p>"You 'gotcha'-ed us both on the same day?" she asked, the wonder that was in her eyes dripping down into her voice as the words emerged. </p><p>"I sure did."</p><p>It was moments like that, the ones where Stevie was so... <em>Stevie</em> that it made Agatha swell with a feeling that somehow felt so much deeper than love. It was moments like that, as they played through Agatha's mind like a movie as she sat in that car, where Agatha felt like her life had finally reached a state of utter perfection.</p><p>They weren't working toward any larger goal other than the one where they lived a happy life. Things were never going to be roses and sunshine all the time, and the last year or so had proved as much. They all had each other and with that being an immovable fact of the universe, they were always going to get through whatever life had to throw at them.</p><p>Despite her elation toward the night ahead, something in Agatha felt... a little weighted, if she had to try and explain it. It was just the softest gnawing, as if something were wrong. She tried to assess, tried to think about her day and the impending evening ahead, but everything seemed to be going to plan in a way that did not require any concern.</p><p>Agatha exhaled a sigh and lifted her arm to check the time on the digital screen of her watch. She was still pretty on track for the way she had mapped it all out in her head. After collecting her bag and putting her coat back on, she climbed out of the car and made her way up to their front door. When she went to unlock it and found that it was already in such a state, her brow pinched slightly. </p><p>As she pushed the door open, she had done so in enough time to see Rio disappear into the pantry. Agatha kicked the door shut behind her, her eyes falling to the dining room table. There, laying atop the stained wood was a bouquet of flowers.</p><p>They weren't roses.</p><p>They weren't even lilies, Agatha's favorite when it came to bouquets.</p><p>It was a bouquet of poppies.</p><p>Agatha approached the table at the same time Rio's emerged from the pantry with a box of fruit snacks in her hand.</p><p>"Oh! Hi, my love," Rio greeted warmly, easily gliding straight toward Agatha, offering a kiss of hello that Agatha took despite her confusion.</p><p>"I did not expect you to be home yet," Agatha offered back lightly, though she stole a second gentle peck. Her eyes flickered down to the table and the flowers resting there. "Not exactly an anniversary bouquet, my love."</p><p>The way Rio stepped back and looked back at Agatha, confused, it caused Agatha to pause. Why was Rio looking at her like that? Why was Rio wearing that frown, those dark eyes cloudy with her misunderstanding. They, too, dropped to the poppies before sweeping back up to Agatha.</p><p>"They aren't for you," Rio informed her.</p><p>If Agatha had been standing a few feet in front of a cannon and it fired directly into her chest, it would not hit her nearly as hard as the debilitating realization that suddenly launched into her.</p><p>
<b>November 16th.<br/>
1 year after Stevie's adoption.<br/>
2 years after Agatha's accident.<br/>
And.<br/>
17 years since the day Agatha had lost Nicky.</b>
</p><p>At the moment of impact, tears sprung to Agatha's eyes that she had absolutely no way of containing. Her face folded in every crease manageable and it was a miracle that she had not collapsed instantaneously. </p><p>Rio watched it all happen, almost in slow motion, but moved into action before it could devolve any further. She stepped forward and was quick to embrace Agatha with a hold that almost felt constrictive, but Agatha didn't care.</p><p>
<em>How had she forgotten about Nicky?</em>
</p><p>Agatha hadn't actually forgotten about Nicky. She still thought of him often, but this year... This year was the first year that she had not been entirely fixated on the approach of that day for that reason exclusively. Instead, she had watched the day as it rolled closer to her and had only given it the acknowledgement of what pertained directly to her wife and their child.</p><p>It hadn't been intentional and was by no means malicious, but it made Agatha feel <em>so fucking guilty.</em></p><p>Before any spiraling could happen, another realization followed. That impact was still firm, but there was an underlying gentleness that Agatha felt immediately.</p><p>Agatha had forgotten.</p><p>Rio had not.</p><p>Slowly, Agatha pulled her head off of Rio's shoulder to look at her, those blue eyes so cracked in their emotion as they found their home of those dark honey pools.</p><p><em>"You remembered," </em>Agatha squeaked and the observation was met with the feeling of Rio's palm on her cheek.</p><p>
<em>"Of course I did. I --" </em>
</p><p>Before Rio could continue, before she could explain herself, there was another sound. It was another voice. It was Stevie's voice.</p><p>"Mama! I found my hat!" she nearly shouted as she came bounding down the stairs.</p><p>Once more, Agatha's features cinched and she was thankful that the moment Rio looked back to her, she was also offering an explanation.</p><p>"I pulled her when I left work," she voiced as if it were the logical thing to do.</p><p>"Why?" Agatha asked back, still confused.</p><p>"Because we have a two hour drive to Goshen."</p><p>Every piece fell into place with that revelation of Rio's intentions. Once more, Agatha wanted to shatter.</p><p>Rio had taken off work and picked Stevie up from school early so that they could go visit Nicky and leave him flowers. He would have been twenty-two that year, and Agatha knew that he also would have been the best big brother in the entire world, if he'd been given the chance.</p><p>There had never been an explicit discussion with Stevie since she had come to live with them about Nicky aside from the mention of him the day Stevie had taken custody of Scratchy. Even a year later, she still loved that thing. It wasn't that Agatha was hiding anything from her, it was just that it was a very heavy and very intricate conversation to be having with a six-year-old.</p><p>As Stevie's feet hit the ground floor, those beautiful little grey eyes swept toward the kitchen, widening as they took in the sight of Agatha.</p><p>"Momma! You're home!" Stevie cried in excitement, nearly tripping over her own feet to bolt toward Agatha.</p><p>With incredible deft and fluidity, Agatha turned and bent at the waist to scoop Stevie into her arms, planting her securely on her hip.</p><p>"Hi sweet pea," Agatha greeted, reaching up to run a fingertip town the length of Stevie's nose.</p><p>"Mama said we're going for a drive!" she informed Agatha, her grin communicating just how thrilled she was with such a notion.</p><p>"We are, and we're gonna be outside for a little once we get there, so it's a good thing you have your hat!" Agatha said back, somehow finding a strength to weave over her words that she did not actually feel right then. She craned her head forward and pressed her lips to Stevie's forehead and set her back to her feet. As she met Rio evenly again, it was Agatha this time who reached up to grace a feather light touch over her cheek.</p><p>"I love you," she told Rio, taking a kiss from her.</p><p>When she pulled away, that look on Rio's face nearly atomized her from just how warm it was.</p><p>"I love you too, my wife," Rio cooed softly before she took just one more kiss and they set about preparing for their mini road trip. </p><p>Rio had shoved the fruit snacks and a couple of juices into a backpack as Agatha helped bundle Stevie in her thick coat. For good measure, she placed a scarf in Stevie's hand and reached up to jostle the purple hat with cat ears sewn to the top as it sat on her head.</p><p>"You don't have to wear it right now," Agatha informed her, "but it's probably a good thing to have just in case."</p><p>"Do we get to play in the snow?!" Stevie questioned, her grin both instant and also audible in her delighted squeal.</p><p>"I don't know how much snow they have where we're going, but if they have some, we can absolutely play in it for a little bit," Agatha retuned as she pressed off of her knees to return to full height. As she turned her head, she took in the sight of Rio as she approached, that bouquet cradled in her arm as though it were as precious as a newborn baby.</p><p>On Rio's torso was Agatha's black Harvard hoodie, and a pair of bootcut jeans clung to her legs. She had already put her Docs on and her hair hung in slight disarray as it both hung over her shoulders and gathered haphazardly in the hood behind her. She looked so effortlessly good, but also so relaxed in a way that offered a now frazzled Agatha some sense of reprieve.</p><p>"Stop that," Rio chastised as she got closer. The moment Agatha's arms threaded through her coat, Rio handed over the flowers so she could put on her own.</p><p>"Stop what?" Agatha inquired, her tone quiet and still laden with the shame she was feeling over having forgotten about what that day had always been for her.</p><p>"Beating yourself up," Rio answered, reaching down to tug upward on her zipper. Her head lifted from her work and she took Agatha in, just studying her pensively. "It's okay. A lot has happened in the last year. It's not a bad thing that you're in a good enough place that the painful memories don't immediately make themselves known."</p><p>As the understanding settled within her, Agatha lost her breath for a few seconds. </p><p>What a profound way to re-frame what Agatha was considering to be carelessness.</p><p>What a statement to make, and what a way to phrase it so that Agatha was forced into seeing it for what it was.</p><p>Enough time had passed and enough had happened that her focus had simply shifted into more prevalent, more present things in her life. She had been so fixated on the now, on the life that was at her feet. Agatha's past was the very reason she had that life, but it no longer anchored her with only her nose above water.</p><p>Now, she could tread. Now, she could keep her head above that water instead. Now, she didn't feel like she was at risk of drowning.</p><p>Agatha's lips twitched, down first but then lifted a moment later as she debated her words before verbalizing them.</p><p>"I want to say I love you, but I want to add that it pales in comparison to how I'm actually feeling right now. You are... You are incredible. And I am very lucky to have you," Agatha admitted, leaning toward Rio to brush her cheek with an affectionate kiss.</p><p>"Me too!" Stevie chimed in, her tone as bright as that light in her eyes.</p><p>"Not as lucky as I am to have my girls," Rio responded, her own smile wide in its gratitude.</p><p>After the short ordeal of packing up the car and getting Stevie out of her coat so that she could be a little more comfortable during the couple hour drive, Agatha slid into the passenger's seat and laid the flowers across her lap, staring down at them.</p><p>She was aware that Rio got in, that she started the car and backed them out of the drive. She was aware that Stevie and Rio started to hold a conversation about the blue fruit snacks in the Scooby Doo packs. She was aware that they were leaving Watertown and heading west, but she never stopped staring at those flowers. Not for the first twenty minutes of their drive.</p><p>Rio seemed to notice this at minute twenty-one. She repositioned her hold on the steering wheel so that her hand closest to Agatha was free. She reached over with it and picked up Agatha's fingers as they rested over the cluster of poppy stems.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Rio asked her over the melodious sound of the lyricless music playing through the speakers, keeping Stevie content in the back seat.</p><p>"Yes," Agatha answered almost immediately, but it was a lie and Rio knew it.</p><p>"Do you want to try that again?" Rio pressed a little harder.</p><p>"I'm okay, really. It's just... a lot to think about."</p><p>"I know, my love," Rio offered in consolation. "But it's a good day. A happy day. It's not any less of one because there are hard memories. We celebrate him today in the same way we celebrate her and our love."</p><p>All this time later, all the days they had lived through behind them, and Rio still knew <em>exactly</em> the right thing to say.</p><p>Agatha silently gripped her hand, as if providing her answer through that contact. She let her gaze fall out of the window, watching as the sights of the city itself began to ebb and were instead replaced with grassy fields and occasional fencing that corralled cows or horses.</p><p>They'd passed the half-way marker time-wise when Stevie asked a question that was a little overdue.</p><p>"Mom?" </p><p>"Yes, baby?" Agatha returned, shifting so that she could look over the back of the seat at their little girl.</p><p>"Where are we going?" It was an easy and obvious question. It was also crippling the moment it bored into Agatha's ears, straight through to the stem of her brain where it wrapped and squeezed.</p><p>Too many seconds had passed for Rio not to notice Agatha's hesitation, so she was the one who spoke first in an attempt to quell the panic she knew was building in her wife's chest.</p><p>"Do you remember when mom gave you Scratchy and told you that he used to belong to a little boy she knew?" Rio braved, feeling as though it were a good starting point. She would use Stevie's recollection to pick up the thread, one that she could follow a little easier.</p><p>"Yeah," Stevie answered simply, meeting Rio's eyes in the reflection of the rearview mirror. "She said he didn't need them anymore and that I could have them."</p><p>As this conversation was progressing, Agatha felt the need to turn back around. She could not look at her daughter while this information was being given to her. She was even more thankful for that when Rio's next words were filled with a content that Agatha had thought might come at least a few sentences later.</p><p>"Yes, exactly. He didn't need them anymore because when he was little, and mom was a lot younger, he became really sick and he passed away."</p><p>Although Agatha tried to fight it, the burn of the salty tears that built behind her eyes became too much. She blinked and in doing so, released the flood. She did not make a single sound, but those tears were hot and rapid, falling again and again as she sat there, clutching those flowers and staring dead ahead. </p><p>Not a moment after she finished speaking, Rio squeezed her hand again in a silent show of emotional and physical support. </p><p>Stevie's response pierced through Agatha like a steel arrow.</p><p>"Oh, he's an angel?" she questioned, and while Agatha couldn't see it, Rio did not miss the way Stevie's focus shifted to the back of Agatha's seat.</p><p>"Something like that," Rio agreed, her voice homey and tender. "But... We are going to his resting place. We're gonna leave him the flowers mom's holding and spend a little bit of time with him."</p><p>"That's good," Stevie concurred, her eyes shifting back to the window as her legs began to kick the slightest bit. She was quiet for only a moment and did not shift her focus as her voice sounded again. "Did he like the snow?"</p><p>Agatha shuddered with a silent sob that she somehow kept held in the center of her throat before it could spill out into the confines of the car. This time, Rio let her take the time she needed so that she could be the one to answer.</p><p>"Nicky loved the snow," Agatha informed her, though her tone wobbled and shook over her words. "He liked to make ice cream out of it."</p><p>Another tremble of tone, another squeezing of her fingers by her wife.</p><p>"You can make ice cream out of snow?!" Stevie exclaimed, leaning forward in her seat a little bit.</p><p>"You can," Rio affirmed, glancing just briefly over her shoulder to flash Stevie a bright smile. "We'll have to give it a go soon."</p><p>"I'd like that," Stevie replied and the conversation seemed to end there. </p><p>The rest of the ride was mostly quiet, interspersed with only a light back and forth, usually about something Stevie saw outside of the window. Agatha had not said much else other than to offer a soft <em>mmhmm</em> or <em>yeah, of course </em>in idle response.</p><p>The voice of the GPS -- which Rio had hilariously set to have a British accent -- indicated the turn into the cemetery. The moment the front tires crossed onto that dirt road, Agatha could feel her throat tighten. It had been a very, very long time since she had made this trip. She had been in Boston for four years, and in that time, she had never once braved the drive.</p><p>That was because after running all over the world for nearly fifteen years, she had not wanted to confront her failure. Something that Rio had assured her of in the last two years of their relationship was that it was not Agatha's fault. She had assured Agatha, using the knowledge she had gained through years of studies, that there was nothing she could have actually done to keep him. It was a hard conversation every time, but it had finally started to sink in.</p><p><em>"Just tell me where to go," </em>Rio requested softly and Agatha gave a stiff nod while she willed her vocal cords to vibrate with her answer.</p><p><em>"Take this back until the second left turn. About halfway through should be good enough. It's close to the statue of the praying hands." </em>Agatha was trying to be louder, trying to be more assertive in her directions, but as her eyes lifted, she could already see it across the hundreds of feet of distance between the three of them in that car and where Nicky's headstone was, the top of it dusted with snow.</p><p>Rio did as she had been instructed and the car veered right slightly so she could park it in the grass. The moment she turned off the engine, she looked over at Agatha who saw the move and met her gaze.</p><p>Wordlessly, Rio reached up and took a light hold on Agatha's chin, looking her directly in the eyes. She was quiet for a long few moments before she found her voice.<em>"It's a good thing. It's a way that Stevie can learn about her big brother without having a complex explanation she might not understand yet. And it's a way for you to have some peace over the way you're treating yourself right now."</em></p><p>Agatha's expression pulled down hard and fast at those words, even if she knew Rio was entirely correct. Agatha had not been kind to herself despite Rio's assurances that nothing she had done was actually <em>wrong.</em> It was just difficult to shake the feeling that it was.</p><p>This time, Agatha's lips parted just barely in a show that she wanted to say something, but Rio was too quick in the way she kissed her. She swallowed down whatever argument Agatha was going to try to provide in the execution of such an action.</p><p>She just let Rio kiss her. There were no more tears, no more anguished sounds that fell from Agatha. Instead, her eyes opened to behold her wife and this time, her lips pushed upward instead of down.</p><p><em>"You are my everything," </em>Agatha whispered, her own hand lifting to tuck a few strands of Rio's wild hair behind her ear.</p><p><em>"As you are mine." </em>Rio gave her another soft peck and relinquished her hold so that they could go about the task of unloading and making their way to their destination.</p><p>Once Stevie's coat was back on and the snow crunched beneath her boots, Agatha picked up her hand and as the troupe they were, they ventured over to the very spot Agatha knew like the back of her hand. Rio had been given possession of the poppies, which she cradled carefully once more in her arm.</p><p>They formed a small line with Agatha in the middle, both of her hands secured in the holds of the women she loved most. As they stilled, they were in front of the intricately carved headstone that jutted up from the ground, the words clear even though small slopes of snow had gathered in the indentations of the lettering.</p><p>
<b>NICHOLAS SCRATCH<br/>
B. Aug 21st, 2004. D. Nov 16th, 2009.<br/>
Beloved son. Forever loved, forever missed.</b>
</p><p>The first sound Agatha heard was not one she had been expecting. It hadn't come from her. Instead, Stevie spoke next to her as she read the name, slowly sounding it out as her brain made work of the processing it took to do so.</p><p><em>"Nich-o-las Scra-tch." </em>Something in Agatha wavered, though it nearly broke the moment she looked down to see Stevie staring back up at her. "That was his name?"</p><p>Agatha gave a lone nod. "It was. But how you like to be called Stevie even though your name is Stephanie, he liked to be called Nicky."</p><p>"Nicky," Stevie repeated, her voice soft and filled with an affection Agatha was not even sure Stevie understood she was capable of. In the same moment, she felt Rio offer a supportive squeeze of her hand, though she did not speak.</p><p>Those emotional blue eyes tore away from her daughter as she focused instead on the physical memory of her son in the form of that headstone. She assessed what to do. There was a thin layer of snow on the ground, though not as much as there had been in the city. It was also a bit cold, but it wasn't insufferable enough that they couldn't spend a little bit of time there.</p><p>Having made her decision, Agatha's hand released its hold on Rio's and offered it, palm up, so that she could take the bouquet. The moment it was in her grasp, she leaned toward Rio for a soft gracing of lips and then turned to face front again. Her next movement happened quickly as her legs folded and she placed herself atop the snow, not caring that by the time she got up, her pants would be soaked.</p><p>The moment she was situated with her legs crossed beneath her, Agatha gave a small tug on Stevie's hand, a request for her to place herself in the cradle created by the way Agatha was sitting. She complied easily, fitting herself perfectly in it.</p><p>Agatha brought her arm around so that she could hold the poppies over Stevie's lap. At the same time, she kissed the back of her head over the woven fabric of the hat she was wearing.</p><p>"Nicky would have loved you," Agatha informed her. Of that much, she was absolutely certain. "He would have been such a good brother to you, would have taken you to the park and gotten pizza with you. Pizza was one of his favorites, too."</p><p>"Really?" Stevie asked back, turning her head slightly but not enough to actually look at Agatha. "What kind of stuff did he like on his?"</p><p>"He liked mushrooms, too, but he liked bacon on his. And he liked garlic sauce better than red sauce. He was weird like that," she disclosed, exhaling a breath of a laugh against the back of Stevie's head.</p><p>"What else did he like, momma?" Stevie inquired, her tone so, so soft in a way that displayed her understanding that this was a rather deep and heavy moment.</p><p>"He liked Blues Clues, but back when the guy on it was named Steve," she divulged and this drew a giggle out of Stevie.</p><p>"That's almost like my name," she observed, causing Agatha to choke down the emotion that about spilled out of her in the form of a sob. Instead, she channeled it into something that was more of a chuckle of affection.</p><p>"It is, you're right. He liked dinosaur nuggets and making bracelets out of dandelions. He liked playing the game Trouble, but only wanted to push the bubble and make the dice dance. That made him giggle a lot, especially when he would do it with his head." Somewhere in the middle of such a list, Rio had moved to squat just behind her. This only became apparent when Agatha felt Rio's palm press to the center of her back in support.</p><p>"Not his head!" Stevie said as she feigned a groan that was closely related to one that Agatha exhaled in moments of exasperation.</p><p>"He like it when we went to this place to eat called Tides because he would just sit and watch the ocean on both sides while he dipped his French fries in ranch dressing. He really liked the ice cream sundaes they made there, too."</p><p>Stevie had started to feel out the small leaves and petals between her fingers as Agatha recounted the things she remember about Nicky, the things she felt Stevie could relate to. Stevie, in all of her acute awareness, posed a question that melted Agatha despite the cold that soaked through to her bones.</p><p>"Can we go there some time?"</p><p>Agatha wrapped her free arm around Stevie's front and hugged her tight, leaving her lips pressed to the top of her hat for a long few moments of consideration, although she was keenly understanding the fact that her answer would never be anything but the one she provided.</p><p>"Of course, sweet pea. I think you would like it there. They have really good chicken strips."</p><p>They sat there for a little while longer as Agatha recounted many more favorites and many more memories that she'd had with Nicky before Rio had finally decided to break her silence, having noticed the deep crimson that had formed on the cheeks of her wife and daughter.</p><p>"We can keep talking, but we should maybe load back up into the car. You're both very cold," she observed in a tender but concerned tone.</p><p>Agatha gave an understanding nod and released the hold she had around Stevie's middle. Then, she let go of the poppies, leaving them in Stevie's lap.</p><p><em>"How about you give him these?"</em> Agatha posed in a low murmur. <em>"I think he'd like that."</em></p><p>Stevie's head turned and her eyes lifted to fall directly into Agatha's.</p><p>"Me?" she asked, as though she comprehended exactly what Agatha was asking of her, despite the fact that it was a very big and very grown up request in regard to the emotional weight of it.</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>Stevie smiled.</p><p>It wasn't a grin, wasn't a toothy smile. </p><p>It was an understanding one.</p><p>She turned forward again and pushed herself out of Agatha's lap, careful in the way she handled the bouquet as she did so. As she found her footing, Stevie just stood there for a moment and Agatha watched her back, honed in to every single move she was making. After a couple of seconds of what Agatha would later realize was reverence, Stevie leaned forward and propped the flowers against the headstone.</p><p>Then, she said something that nearly caused Agatha's soul to eject right out of her body.</p><p>"Thanks for sharing mom with me."</p><p>Agatha's head flew back as she stared into the grey sky above, so similar to the color of her daughter's eyes. The burn at the backs of her own was searing and instant in a way that felt debilitating. It felt like they were going to turn to ash right there in her skull. Immediately, Rio's firm grasp was on her shoulder and her whisper was close to Agatha's ear.</p><p><em>"I know. Come on, it won't do you any good to have tears frozen to your cheeks." </em>As if to accentuate her point, Rio's lips pressed to the flesh just below Agatha's eye.</p><p>Rio helped her to her feet and they reinstated their chain, the one created by the linking of their hands as they made their way back to the car. It was Rio, this time, who volunteered to get Stevie prepped and into her booster. She had given Agatha a light hug and encouraged her to climb into her seat before she set about tending to Stevie.</p><p>The weight of the outing had settled over the three of them on the drive back. </p><p>The honest truth?</p><p>Agatha felt like she <em>finally</em> had closure. </p><p>She had run for so long and for too many miles to count. She had planned to never visit that grave again for as long as she lived. </p><p>Rio's loving intervention had made damn sure that she would find the peace she had convinced herself she never deserved. Because Rio was devoted to her. Because Rio valued Agatha's emotional well being, no matter how deeply that ran or how rooted in her trauma it was. Because Rio had made her a promise the day they'd gotten that marriage license that they were bound, no matter what.</p><p>Because Rio loved Agatha, through and through, in ways words could never convey.</p><p>Agatha knew that fact so wholly because she felt that way about Rio, too.</p><p>When they had about forty minutes left in their drive, Agatha remembered something. </p><p>"I'm going to place our dinner orders," she voiced and although she wasn't loud, Rio still jumped, clearly not expecting Agatha to speak. "That way we can stop on the way home and grab them. We can save the other thing for tomorrow." This was in reference to the cookie cake, which Rio seemed to get with ease.</p><p>"Do I still get chicken strips?!" Stevie called from the back seat.</p><p>"Yes, baby, you still get your chicken strips. Extra ranch, right?" Agatha asked, seeking confirmation.</p><p>"Yes please."</p><p>As Agatha pulled out her phone and set to ordering, double checking that Rio wanted the Korean lettuce wraps and ordering herself the pasta alla vodka, something was beginning to build in her. It started in her middle and was making a rapid approach to her chest. By the time she added an serving of beignets to Stevie's to supplement for the loss of the cookie cake on such a special occasion and submitted both orders, it was sitting in her throat.</p><p>It was the startling realization that she had a full and complete life. </p><p>Sure, there would be things to do, sights to see, experiences to be had, but in that moment as she watched the city come back into view, Agatha knew that everything she would ever need?</p><p>They were right there, beside her and behind her. </p><p>Rio had made the designated stops once back in Watertown, picking up their food so that they could return home to share their meal. It had been calm, but there was still an obvious excitement there that was only made that much sweeter by the five hour trip they had taken inland.</p><p>Once dinner was finished and Stevie had consumed the majority of the beignets, they had granted her request for one game of Fortnite that had turned into two when they lost the first one. Noting the time had caused Agatha to call a wrap of the evening, and Stevie offered no protest. Instead, she offered an involuntary yawn as she stretched in her sleepiness.</p><p>Although it had not been a conversation beforehand, Rio had volunteered to take Stevie upstairs to get her changed an in bed. In the same breath, she told Agatha to grab the 1987 Château Margaux Pavillon out of the cubby in the pantry and a couple of glasses. Agatha had agreed and placed a quick kiss to Stevie's head before she departed to the kitchen as the two of them made their climb to the third floor.</p><p>When Agatha emerged from the pantry with the bottle secured tightly in her hand, she had paced to the portion of the cabinet where the wine glasses she had brought with her when she moved in were housed. She even went as far as to open the door, but when she saw them? She didn't want them. She closed it and instead shifted to her left, pulling that door open. With a deft hand, she reached inside and threaded her fingers and thumb through two mug handles and pulled them out. The clinking they made as the ceramic jostled and bumped was the strangest song of reminiscence, one that made Agatha's heart sing in time.</p><p>She had followed the path set by her loved ones as she ascended to the top floor, breezing by Stevie's door so she could drop off the wine and mugs, leaving them in the center of her nightstand so that she could return to bid their daughter a goodnight. </p><p>Stepping inside Stevie's room, Agatha realized that her timing had been impeccable when she saw Rio kiss Stevie's forehead and get back to her feet. As they passed one another, they shared in their nightly lip locking ritual before Rio disappeared into the hallway.</p><p>As Agatha's gentle blue eyes fell on Stevie in that bed, that rabbit -- now a little more worn than he had been a year ago -- tucked under her arm, Agatha felt truly blessed. Stevie had been theirs for a year, and it had been an amazing year. They had experienced so much, made so many memories, and while Stevie's path had not been one that was ever straight-forward, seeing her grow and learn from things like school and therapy had been breathtaking to watch.</p><p>There she lay, that big and loving smile on her face, watching as her mom approached to wish her sweet dreams.</p><p>Agatha placed herself on the edge of the bed, her backside pressed lightly against Stevie's hip. A tender hand reached forward and caring fingertips pushed her hair back off of her forehead. Before she could pull her hand away, Stevie spoke.</p><p>"Momma?" she posed, her voice so very small.</p><p>Agatha removed the contact and sat up a little, propping herself up on a hand that stationed atop the mattress on the other side of Stevie's body.</p><p>"Yes, sweet pea?" </p><p>Stevie's lips worried together for a moment as she seemed to debate what she wanted to ask.</p><p>"You said... that Nicky can be with me sometimes?" Her grey eyes looked up into Agatha's blue ones and Agatha felt the heat in her chest in an instant. Her hand lifted again to cup Stevie's smooth cheek in her palm.</p><p>"I did. In fact, I think he comes to hang out with all of us every now and again." She almost choked on the last two words as they came out just after Stevie reached up to touch Agatha's cheek, too.</p><p>"I think it's 'cause he misses you." </p><p>Agatha lips pressed tight, but after a beat, they stretched in a smile that did not convey just how badly she wanted to burst into tears. She leaned forward and pressed her lips to Stevie's forehead, whispering against her skin.</p><p><em>"Maybe it was why he used to. Now I like to think it's to keep us all safe." </em>The moment she went to sit up again, Stevie's touch resumed, but it mimicked Agatha's in that her whole hand covered Agatha's cheek.</p><p><em>"He's doing a good job,"</em> Stevie announced decidedly. <em>"He's probably why you met mama. She keeps you safe, too."</em></p><p>Once more, Agatha was gulping down each sob that tried to fight its way up her throat so that she did not completely lose it in front of her daughter. Several muscles in her face twitched in that desperation before they finally smoothed and she was able to wear a genuine and thankful smile.</p><p>
<em>"Get some sleep, sweet girl. I love you."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I love you too, mom."</em>
</p><p>Somehow, Agatha managed to stand. That was a feat given the fact that it felt like her legs were composed of nothing but rubber. Still, they managed to hold her weight as she carried herself into the hall. Before progressing toward their bedroom, she stopped and pressed her back to the wall, careful not to knock the photo frame hanging behind her. </p><p>Much like it had in the cemetery, her head tipped back and she drew in a long and slow breath to try and gain some of her resolve back after a conversation like that one.</p><p>Stevie was six, almost seven. She was still <em>so </em>young, and yet, a statement like <em>that?</em></p><p>She had hit the mark dead-on. </p><p>Bullseye.</p><p>After a couple more calming breaths that expanded Agatha's lungs to full capacity, she pushed herself off of the wall and headed toward their bedroom. She closed the door behind her and locked it, lifting her gaze to see that Rio was sat with her back against the pillows and a pencil in her hands. She was sketching something in the book that was on her lap until Agatha's knees hit the mattress at the foot of the bed.</p><p>Her head lifted but before she could speak a word, Agatha was moving to kneel next to her. With careful hands, she gingerly pulled the pencil from Rio's fingers and closed the book, moving so she could set them both on the nightstand on Rio's side of the bed. Once accomplished, she filled the now-empty space by placing herself in Rio's lap.</p><p>Without hesitating, Rio's hands landed on the tops of Agatha's thighs but they did not move. They sat, stationary and curious, not understanding what Agatha's motives were in those moments.</p><p>Agatha was not going to tell her, not in words. How did one convey that kind of emotion when words simply felt obsolete? </p><p>With actions.</p><p>Agatha had always been good at that.</p><p>Agatha's hands lifted slowly, her intentions fueled by her adoration as they slid smoothly along the angle of Rio's jaw to hold her in place. That intense but gentle look in Agatha's eyes was raw and emotional as she traced out every curve and divot of Rio's features. </p><p>There were mental notes that were repetitions of things Agatha already knew; she loved the tiny scar above Rio's eyebrow that she'd acquired when she'd let her best friend pierce it with a sewing needle when she was sixteen. She loved the tiniest dimple in her right cheek that was only visible when she smiled <em>just</em> the right way. She loved the smallest divot that was directly in the center of her bottom lip. She loved how, in the dim light of the lamp beside Rio's nightstand, the dark honey of her eyes looked almost green. </p><p>As the seconds ticked by, Agatha watched as the understanding melted into Rio's expression. She realized that Agatha was just... appreciating her. Rio didn't question it. In fact, she let it go on for as long as Agatha wanted it to, which was only another few moments. </p><p>That appreciation was next expressed in a different way as Agatha leaned forward, fitting their mouths together in a kiss that was miles away from any previous one she had ever placed there.</p><p>It wasn't rushed, wasn't demanding. It wasn't forceful or some kind of cry for attention.</p><p>The manner which Agatha's lips moved against Rio's was the <em>only </em>way she seemed to be able to find the right way to tell Rio just how much she loved her. That kiss was warm, but it was patient. It was requesting something new, something Agatha had never allowed herself to want before.</p><p>That kiss was the biggest ask of <em>'love me,'</em> that she could manage without speaking the words themselves.</p><p>Rio heard it and answered. She sat up a little, making it so that Agatha didn't have to hunch as much, and raised one of her hands to wrap around so that it could lay flat on her back, directly in the small of it. She kissed Agatha back in the same vein, matching that level of enchantment she was feeling as Agatha poured it into her.</p><p>The softest smacks hit the air for minutes before Agatha made the choice to progress. Her hands slid from Rio's jaw to either side of her neck. At the same time, the tip of Agatha's tongue passed through her lips to run along the underside of Rio's top one, an enamored request for entrance. When it was granted, that meeting of tongues was also tranquil and unhurried. It was an exchange of feelings that could not be shoehorned into any kind of lexicon. It was true emotion it its most pure form.</p><p>Though it was still affectionate and saccharine, the exchange grew in heat. After what could have been five minutes or twenty -- Agatha had completely lost track -- her hands lifted from Rio's neck and dropped. Her fingers knotted into the hem of Rio's sleep shirt and tugged up enough that Rio complied by lifting her arms. The only reason Agatha parted their lips was to remove it before returning to just the way they had been before.</p><p>That kiss was considerably shorter, this time broken by the way she moved to kiss the corner of Rio's mouth, her cheek, the corner of her jaw. The flesh of her lips graced lightly over Rio's ear, her neck. It was this charted path that Agatha knew like the back of her hand, one she could follow with her eyes closed. </p><p>She took her time, intentionally covering every inch of Rio's skin she could get to from her position with her loving and adoring kisses. She kissed those collarbones she loved, kissed the tops of her shoulders, the entirety of her sternum. Scooting back, she found the ability to kiss over one of Rio's breasts, across the valley between them, and then paid the same attention to the other.</p><p>Agatha would occasionally suck on a patch of skin, but there was no intent to mark, no desire to use teeth. That felt too fervent for what she was trying to accomplish. Instead, she just let her lips do the majority of the work. </p><p>Kisses trailed further, down the expanse of Rio's abdomen the further back Agatha shifted. About mid-way down, Agatha's hands lifted so that she could curl her fingers into the cinched waistband of the basketball shorts Rio was wearing. The kisses never desisted as she adjusted enough to accommodate their removal. They traveled down the top of one leg in the wake of the garment and once it was removed, traversed a similar path back up the other one.</p><p>From where she was situated on her knees between Rio's legs, she took in the sight of her wife before her, bare and exposed in a way she reserved for Agatha's eyes only. She was art, truly and completely and Agatha felt <em>so fucking lucky </em>in those moments that Rio was her life.</p><p>Rio was her wife, a mother of their child. </p><p>Rio was everything and anything, all at the same time.</p><p>Agatha reached carefully to hook her hands into the backs of Rio's thighs as she gave a gentle tug toward herself. The move offered wordless instruction that Rio heeded with ease, sliding down so that she was a little more relaxed.</p><p>Once she was situated, Agatha leaned over her -- hair spilling over her shoulder and all -- so that she could give her one last kiss. They parted again and Agatha kissed Rio's chest once more, but her path was a direct one down the center of Rio's body. She shifted as she did so until a point where she was able to place herself on her belly and chest directly between Rio's legs, which were bent at the knees just enough that Agatha was able to slide her arms under them. Her palms lifted from the mattress in silent request.</p><p>Almost instantly, Rio's fingers filled the spaces between Agatha's and gave a gentle grip as their eyes met across the expanse of her body.</p><p>Agatha almost said it, but the way Rio smiled at her without a word spoken? </p><p>She didn't have to.</p><p>Rio knew how much Agatha loved her.</p><p>Instead, she used her mouth for other things.</p><p>Despite the levels of tenderness being exponentially higher than they ever had been before, it seemed as though it was still more than enough to arouse Rio, as Agatha found out the moment her mouth met Rio's soft and supple flesh, that familiar taste instant on her tongue. At almost the exact same time, Rio's right hand released Agatha's left and moved to slide into her hair. It wasn't forceful or making any demands. It was just a way to be the tiniest bit closer.</p><p>Agatha didn't mind. She actually liked it. </p><p>Every swipe of her tongue was gentle, intentional. Each time the tip of it would brush over Rio's clit, she would let out the softest whimper as her fingers flexed both in Agatha's hair and in her hold. The moment Agatha's lips pursed over it and sucked ever-so-softly, a quiet but pleasured moan rumbled out of her. </p><p>Carrying on happily like that for several long moments, Agatha could sense that Rio was growing restless, aching for release. To assist her tongue in its ministrations, Agatha shifted enough that she could bring her left hand up. The tips of her fingers first followed the path her tongue was leaving for a few laps but then dropped lower before she pressed them into Rio's core, pulling out a low and gratified groan from low in her throat. </p><p>Rio shifted her hips in a way that begged for more, all the while her knuckles were nearly white as she grasped at Agatha's hand. </p><p>Agatha gave it to her.</p><p>She added a third finger to her work and turned the attention of her tongue and lips exclusively to that erect bundle of nerves. With just the right flick of both that tongue as well as the fingers inside of Rio's warm sex, she felt it everywhere at once as Rio's body tensed and the trembling began to build. In the next second, Rio's thighs pulled inward enough to cage Agatha's head between them at the exact moment her breathy moan hit Agatha's ears.</p><p>
<em>"Oh, my love!"</em>
</p><p>Maybe under any other circumstance, Agatha would have kept pressing. Maybe she would have tried to turn it into a marathon, to try and see just how many orgasms she could pull from Rio's body, but this time she had other intentions.</p><p>Agatha was still as her wife rode the waves of her orgasm into shore, only moving once Rio's holds on her hand and hair loosened. She pressed herself up and crawled over Rio's torso in a way that enabled her to kiss her again. It didn't last long, though, before Agatha shifted to slide to her feet off the edge of the bed.</p><p>Chest still heaving from her spot on the bed, Rio's confused calling came the moment Agatha started to walk away. </p><p><em>"Hey... what..."</em> </p><p>Before she could find the wherewithal to actually finish asking, Agatha disappeared into the closet, turning toward Rio's side. After only a moment, she was returning, the leather harness dangling from her fingertips as she came to halt at the corner of the bed.</p><p>As their eyes met, the question in Rio's gaze was clear. Agatha was quick to offer an answer.</p><p><em>"I want to look you in the eyes this time," </em>she informed her in a whisper that came out almost bashful.</p><p>The understanding settled over Rio like the warmth of a summer day. Without another word, she got to her feet and met Agatha where she stood, grasping the leather so that she could put it on while Agatha stripped herself down. When they were both best suited for what was about to happen, Rio looked across the nine or so inches of space between them, another question in those soft honey eyes.</p><p>Agatha heard it and glanced toward the bed for a moment before she spoke again.</p><p>
<em>"Will you sit like you were earlier?"</em>
</p><p>The shock on Rio's face was almost palpable. She immediately understood this for what it was: This was not Agatha wanting to be fucked stupid until she passed out in a pool of pleasure. This was not Agatha needing to be railed to try and cope with emotions she didn't know how to process. </p><p>By <em>asking</em> instead of <em>telling</em>, Agatha was showing Rio that this was a need for closeness, a desire to do something Agatha would never be able to claim she had never done.</p><p>Agatha wanted to make love to her.</p><p>Rio did as she had been asked and climbed back into her spot, back flush with the pillows behind her. Once more, Agatha placed herself into her wife's lap and leaned down to place a loving kiss against her lips. The moment she broke it, she lifted herself up onto her knees and reached down between her legs, fingers circling around the silicone there so that she could lower herself onto it.</p><p>Once she had achieved her goal in that regard, that full feeling taking her over as her hips slowly settled, both of her hands lifted and secured over Rio's shoulders.</p><p>Rio, who was looking up at her like she was the brightest star in the night sky.</p><p>Rio, who could have just about exploded with how much love she was obviously feeling in that moment.</p><p>Rio, her wife.</p><p>Rio, her soulmate.</p><p>Rio, who reached up for Agatha's face to pull her in enough to kiss her. </p><p>Agatha's hips began to move, to shift as she worked them into Rio's. She was still in control, but it wasn't a need in those moments. Instead, it was a want to share that very control with the woman she was so irrevocably in love with. </p><p>Rio's hands had landed on her hips at first, but as the minutes of Agatha riding her and grinding against her began to wear on, she was growing restless. </p><p>She sat up again, much the same way she had when Agatha placed herself in that spot the first time, but this time her hands moved and fell flat to Agatha's warm back. Concurrently, her lips pressed to the space directly between Agatha's collarbones just before they began the task of ravishing Agatha's chest and breasts with loving kisses. </p><p>Agatha's hand had, at some point, landed on the back of Rio's head, fingers gingerly tangled in her hair to encourage the contact.</p><p>Not at any point did Agatha's motions, the way she rolled her hips down to feel all of her wife inside of her, become frenzied or desperate. Those movements were impassioned, yes, but not needy. </p><p>In the throes of her soft gasps and quiet whimpers, Agatha could sense that feeling building low in her middle. </p><p>Rio noticed it, too, and pulled her lips from Agatha's skin. She tilted her head back up and for some reason, Agatha's eyes opened to find Rio looking right up into them. At the next meeting of their hips, Rio breathed her declaration into the night.</p><p>
<em>"I love you, Agatha."</em>
</p><p>Unsurprisingly, that did exactly what it needed to do.</p><p>All at once, those neurons began to fire, shooting electricity throughout every limb she had as the orgasm crashed into her. She trembled first and then rocked forward, her body pressing to Rio's hot and flush as her cheek landed on Rio's shoulder. A series of shuddered cries and whines fell hot against Rio's skin and her hands had moved from their stationing on Agatha's back so that she could wrap Agatha in her arms instead.</p><p>They remained like that, stilled other than the trembling of Agatha's body as the last bit of her orgasm ebbed away. Slowly, she lifted her head enough so that she could place a kiss to Rio's lips, whispering her own sentiment there, too.</p><p>
<em>"I love you too, Rio."</em>
</p><p>They untangled and Rio shed the harness, dropping it over the side of the bed the exact same way she always did. Not a second later, she slid down onto her back and Agatha was immediate in the way she fit herself against the skin of Rio's side, head laying to rest on Rio's chest. The sound of thumping she heard there was soft, delicate.</p><p>That sound was the baseline that Agatha had now chosen to live her life by.</p><p>That sound was the sound that would always soothe her, no matter the instance.</p><p>That sound was the sound of a heart that beat only for her and their little girl.</p><p>It was also the same sound that let Agatha fall asleep peacefully, a brand new day awaiting her and her loves the moment she opened her eyes once again.</p><p> </p>
