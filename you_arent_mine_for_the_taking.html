<p>Agatha Harkness isn’t having sex.</p><p>Which is quite ironic for a sex therapist.</p><p>But it’s the reminder she gets as she places the freshly printed divorce papers in front of her, Wanda’s signature already perfectly scratched into the page.</p><p>With a satisfying flick of her wrist Agatha signs the line that will set her free from her long dead marriage. She expects to feel a weight lift off her shoulders, but instead she feels nothing. Nothing is changing apart from the fact Wanda is no longer her wife on paper.</p><p>She sets the papers back on the envelope and drops it into her desk drawer with a satisfying sigh. She replaces the empty space with her next client's information.</p><p>
<i>Rio Vidal, Twenty-Seven, Female, Lesbian.</i>
</p><p>Could be interesting, could be entirely boring as some sessions tend to be.</p><p>But something somewhere tells her this is going to be anything but boring.</p><p>She stands, shaking out her shoulders and setting her face into what she hopes is a welcoming and kind but professional smile before making her way to press open the door and call in the new first time client.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha calls out.</p><p>She wishes she had taken a second before calling her in, because Agatha can’t quite control the momentary drop of her jaw as her new client strides across the room flashing her a nervous grin as she slips past her into the room.</p><p>Agatha pulls her hand up to grip her jaw and forces it closed but not before stealing a glance at how her client looks just as good from the back as she does the front. Her eyes roaming down and taking in the way her shorts cling against her thighs. She scolds herself as she lets the door click and continues to massage her jaw as she settles in the seat opposite Rio’s.</p><p>“Terrible cramp,” Agatha explains, pointing to her jaw. “I just can’t seem to shift it.”</p><p>Rio smirks, shakes her head thinking better of whatever she was going to say and just nods. “Rio Vidal, you must be Agatha Harkness?”</p><p>“Agatha is just fine, can I get you some water or coffee?” Agatha asks, her unprofessional gawking has her all out of sequence, she would usually ask this before sitting down.</p><p>“No thank you,” Rio replies quietly, her eyes scattering around the room nervously as she seems to remember where she is and why. Her hands tap against her thigh as she finally meets Agatha’s eyes again. “How does this work?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flick down to her client's left hand and a gold band taunts her, reminding her too where she is and why she is here.</p><p>She clears her throat and gives Rio a soft smile. “I imagine you’re here because there is something getting in the way of your pleasure sexually?”</p><p>Rio nods shyly.</p><p>“Well I am here to work with you on figuring out what that is and how we can help you work through any thoughts and behaviours that may be impacting you at this moment in time,” Agatha leans forward in her seat. “Does that sound okay with you?”</p><p>“Will it work?” Rio asks, her eyebrows scrunching in thought. “Like will I be cured?”</p><p>Agatha chuckles but not cruelly. “It’s all about how you see yourself, what you are experiencing, how you experience it and if you will allow yourself to let change happen. You don’t need to be cured Rio, you may just need a little self confidence.”</p><p>Rio nods again but more sure.</p><p>“So let’s jump right in, no awkward small talk, tell me why you want to work with me?” Agatha asks.</p><p>As she waits for Rio to respond, her eyes can’t seem to control themselves as she fights to restrain herself from letting them flick down to her clients chest. She loses the battle. All that covers her is a thin orange tank, her hard nipples would poke Agatha in the eyes if she stared any longer. Two piercings evident as her chest rises and falls and they push through the fabric slightly with every breath.</p><p>Agatha can feel the flush creeping up the back of her neck and forces herself back to the moment, the very professional moment she is supposed to be having.</p><p>“I-, I haven’t been able to come,” Rio finally replies, her head rolling back in frustration as she does. “It's been almost a year and it's driving me insane.”</p><p>“Do you enjoy sex?” Agatha asks bluntly.</p><p>“I used to.” Rio groans. “Now? Sometimes it feels like an obligation rather than being something good.”</p><p>“An obligation? For you or your wife?”</p><p>Rio snorts. “My wife only gets me off because she ‘feels like it's only fair’. I love making her feel good, but lately it feels preformative, like checking a box at the end of the day.”</p><p>“Does she not like to give?” Agatha asks, curious.</p><p>She’s completely baffled at the thought of anyone not wanting to please the woman in front of her.</p><p>“She used to,” Rio sighs. “I don’t mind if she doesn’t want to but she doesn’t talk to me about it, she knows I want it but the effort just isn’t there and then I get in my head about not feeling wanted and just can’t move past it.”</p><p>“How long have you been together?”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks darken at the question, dropping her head into her hands. “Two years, we got married after six months though.”</p><p>Agatha is momentarily stunned but pushes back any judgement she might be feeling, she gives Rio a minute and lets her continue when she’s ready.</p><p>“It was all really quick, a spur of the moment type situation. We really should have talked about it more, realised what we were actually doing. But here we are, in a marriage that’s on the verge of collapse.”</p><p>“Why do you think that?” Agatha prods.</p><p>Rio laughs, the sound has the heat prickling down Agatha’s spine. “Have you ever had a client come to see you so soon into a marriage?”</p><p>No but she can’t admit that. Time to change the subject.</p><p>“Tell me something that’s going well for you both?”</p><p>The room stills as Rio seems to be digging through her head for something to say. Agatha doesn’t want the session to bring too much negativity to Rio’s already struggling headspace.</p><p>“We can come back to that. Tell me something that’s going well for just you instead,” Agatha offers her an encouraging nod as she watches the relief flash across Rio’s face.</p><p>“My company just completed a build for a client, a fully accessible home for a family of four,” Rio replies proudly. “We help a lot of people who struggle to get the support they need from the government, so being able to see them in a home that they only ever dreamed of and being able to give that to them? It feels pretty damn good.”</p><p>Agatha feels her chest tighten, she’s not one for giving back to her community however the way her client glows proudly at her achievements might be one of the hottest things she has seen.</p><p>She really needs to snap out of whatever the fuck is going on with her. Why is she thinking about her client like this?</p><p>“You own your own company?” Agatha asks, clearing her throat hoping it also clears her thoughts. “That’s- wow that’s really impressive Rio.”</p><p>Rio smiles shyly before letting out a long breath. “If only Hela thought as much, she wants me to get more involved with bigger corporations, earn more money, and build us a bigger house. She thinks what I do is pointless and of no benefit to us because I don’t make much profit.”</p><p>Agatha frowns, biting on the inside of her cheek to hold her tongue from saying what she’s thinking.</p><p>
<i>Her wife is a fucking bitch.</i>
</p><p>“How does that make you feel?” Agatha asks instead.</p><p>“Not good enough? Like I can’t have something important to me without her trying to make it hers too? Like I’m only worth it if my bank balance gives as much as my heart does.”</p><p>“What does she give back?”</p><p>Agatha knows it’s a risky question, thinks she knows the answer but she needs to understand the root cause of Rio’s feelings of unwantedness, which is clearly not just regarding her sexual relationship.</p><p>Rio meets Agatha eye again. “That’s the thing, at the moment? Nothing at all. She’s so different now, colder, distant. Only comes to me when she needs or wants something and I don’t know what changed.”</p><p>“What was she like before?”</p><p>“Before we got married and even through the first few months of marriage she was thoughtful, appreciative, supportive of what I was starting with my business. Things felt equal, we laughed, we cooked, we could stay up all night talking about the future. We had good sex. I felt like she loved me, wanted me,” Rio rambles, her hands swinging wildly as she talks. “Now I’m lucky if she asks how my day was. Just wants a quick fuck and passes out right after.”</p><p>No wonder Rio can’t come, hell Agatha’s insides are curling up at the thought of being neglected like that after feeling on top of the world with lust.</p><p>“You reckon we are doomed?” Rio laughs lightly.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>“I’m not a marriage therapist,” Agatha smirks, leaning in closer. “But I can recommend a few.”</p><p>“Don’t worry I married one,” Rio deadpans and grins wide at Agatha’s jaw dropping before she can stop it. “But can we get back to how I can have my first orgasm in a year before I explode?”</p><p>“Are you willing to have a conversation with your wife and be honest with her?” Agatha asks, tilting her head.</p><p>Rio nods.</p><p>Agatha isn’t one to dance around sessions, likes to get straight to the point, understand who her clients are. How they see themselves, their body, how they want to be seen, touched and what makes them feel good.</p><p>But mostly she wants to know out of pure nosiness, the thrill of knowing people's fantasies? Nothing beats it.</p><p>Agatha really wants to reach into Rio’s brain and see all the dirty secrets she harbours and dreams about.</p><p>“What are you looking for from your sexual partner? What turns you on?”</p><p>Agatha bites back a laugh and the exasperation on Rio’s face at the questions. Clearly not expecting Agatha to go there so soon.</p><p>“Uh- I prefer to top, but I also like being told what to do, I like that they’re asking for something from me and that I can then make them feel good by doing what I’m told.”</p><p>Agatha shifts on her seat, her fingers playing with the buttons on her shirt as she listens, nodding to encourage Rio to continue.</p><p>“I like feeling used for someone else’s pleasure, that turns me on, like they want me and only me to be the one that can do what they want,”  Rio breathes out. “But I also like to receive, I like feeling worthy of touch as much as I give it. I don’t like penetration much, but-“</p><p>Rio’s cheeks are pink as she speaks, Agatha’s are turning the same colour but for entirely different reasons.</p><p>“But?” Agatha asks, genuinely intrigued to know.</p><p>“But I love giving it, I just don’t get to do it often,” Rio finishes and slumps down further into the sofa.</p><p>There is way more to unpack there.</p><p>“Do you use a strap on?” Agatha asks, her curiosity taking the reins.</p><p>“I’d like to more often but Hela doesn’t see the point,” Rio sighs. “It makes me feel good but I guess we can’t always get what we want.”</p><p>Rio gives her a fake grin, like making sacrifices is something she just has to do.</p><p>“Does it give you confidence?” Agatha tries to encourage her to be more honest.</p><p>“Yeah… I think it’s something that definitely helped me before but I have gotten used to it not being something I can have.”</p><p>What Agatha really wants to reply and what she can reply are on the complete opposite ends of professionalism. She chooses silence.</p><p>Agatha pauses for a moment, trying to decide exactly where she wants to take these sessions, <i>take Rio over the desk if she could</i>. She shakes her head, pushing these insane thoughts to the back of her head. She’s never looked at a client this way, never. She was entirely loyal to Wanda during all those years together, not that Wanda could say the same.</p><p>Sure the thoughts weren’t entirely unwanted, but they were definitely inappropriate.</p><p>“I think that’s definitely something we’re going to explore later on during our sessions,” she says, flicking her glance towards her watch. “As I said in my first email this session is thirty minutes and the rest will be an hour, I’m happy to go ahead and book you in for a block of sessions if you think we’ll be a good fit for each other?”</p><p>Agatha can barely look her in the eye as she speaks, why the hell is she picturing other ways they’d fit together. She’s so angry that Rio’s wife doesn’t treat her properly, god what she’d give to treat her better.</p><p>She should absolutely recommend one of her colleagues. She knows she should, damn it’s on page one of her handbook, ‘should you ever feel any sense of sexual attraction to a client, you must find them a suitable alternative.’</p><p>But for some insane reason unbeknownst to her, she goes against her licence as Rio agrees to be booked in for seven further sessions.</p><p>“I’ll send you an email with our plan for next week but I think for now it’s important to not let yourself get too into your head, easier said than done I know, perhaps maybe even put sex on the back burner for now and we’ll focus more on your own pleasure?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes catch hers immediately, “My own pleasure?”</p><p>“Well yeah, you can’t enjoy sex if you don’t know what you enjoy, but this is for next week okay? Have a think,” she says politely, standing up from her chair.</p><p>Rio stands, reaching her hand out for Agatha’s which for some reason she ignores. She just walks towards the door, clicking the lock open and gesturing for Rio to leave.</p><p>There’s no further conversation between the pair, just a ‘see you next week’ as Rio heads down the stairs.</p><p>Agatha sits back at her desk as quickly as she can, exhaling the breath she didn’t realise she was holding as she slumps back against her chair. She looks towards her blouse realising she’s unconsciously unbuttoned the top three buttons whilst talking to Rio.</p><p>She mutters to herself, staring at the tan line that was hidden by her wedding ring,  ‘Rio Vidal. What the hell am I going to do about you?”</p><p>—-</p><p>Rio walks down the winding staircase, worrying she’s said too much, embarrassment settles in her chest at the way Agatha couldn’t look her in the eye as she left the session. That told her she should maybe not have admitted to liking being used within the first thirty minutes of meeting someone.</p><p>
<i>But god would she have let Agatha use her if she asked.</i>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t take her eyes off Agatha the entire time, watching as her fingers unbuttoned her blouse slowly. What she wouldn’t give to feel them round her neck. Fuck no she can’t think like this, she’s there to fix her sex life with her <i>wife</i> not to think about fucking her therapist.</p><p>The embarrassment slowly turns to guilt for even having such a thought as she lets herself back into the apartment.</p><p>That guilt quickly dissipates as she walks in to find Hela draped over the sofa, work laptop abandoned on the coffee table. She doesn’t acknowledge Rio, keeps her focus set on the tv, yelling over her shoulder. “Where the fuck have you been? You were meant to get home an hour ago.”</p><p>Rio shrugs her jacket off her shoulders, draping it over the back of the sofa. “I walked back from the office, it’s too hot for the subway.”</p><p>Hela snorts. “Oh of course, you’ve always got your head in the clouds, what’s the latest daydream of yours?”</p><p>Rio just ignores her, used to the comments she makes about Rio’s ideas, her love for being outside, Hela used to love being out there with her at one point. Loved listening to her thoughts too. She stands awkwardly behind the sofa, her wife still not having turned round to even look at her.</p><p>“Do you want me to make us something for dinner? We could cook it together if you wanted?” She asks, hands reaching out for Hela’s shoulders.</p><p>Her touch is instantly shrugged away. “I’ve eaten, please yourself but don’t make a mess.”</p><p>And at that comment Rio turns on her heels, heading towards the stairs. She wonders why she’s even trying to fix things.</p><p>Deep down she knows <i>her</i> Hela is in there somewhere, the Hela she once fell in love with, that they can get back to how they were.</p><p>But also deep down Rio cannot stop thinking about her fucking sex therapist. The way Agatha’s eyes seemed to fill with fury when she mentioned the way Hela treats her. Rio can’t help but think there was maybe something more than just anger in her eyes.</p><p>Rio walks directly past their bedroom and swings the door to the spare room open, deciding that this is where she’ll spend the night again. She lies flat out on the bed, still in her clothes from her day at the planning office. She stares at the ceiling for what feels like an eternity, grounding herself. The ceiling is often a comfort to her but it’s not working. All she can think about is Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Eventually she pulls her phone from her pocket, grunting in sheer frustration at her thoughts about another woman. She clicks the safari button which instantly takes her to Google and types:</p><p>‘Is it normal to catch feelings for your therapist after one session?’</p><p>As Rio doom scrolls through reddit threads, finding no relief to her current dilemma, the door presses open slowly.</p><p>“Come back to bed tonight?” Hela asks, a flash of an apologetic smile. “I could use some help unwinding after the nightmare of a day I had.”</p><p>Hela winks as she turns without waiting for an answer. Knowing the only answer will be Rio’s warmth pressed against her.</p><p>Rio shouldn’t crawl back to her so easily, she really shouldn’t.</p><p>But her feet are already pressing into the carpet and the thought of ‘maybe tonight will be different’ pulls her towards the open bedroom door.</p><p>Maybe tonight she will want her for more than just a fuck. Maybe she’ll want her the way she used to again.</p><p>She swallows the simmering guilt that also has her not caring if tonight means anything at all.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio scrolls for what feels like the hundredth time since she found Agatha’s ad on instagram a month ago.</p><p>The pull in her stomach as she lets her eyes linger on the therapist's photo is still the same as it was when she hit the ‘contact me’ button two weeks ago.</p><p>It should be criminal for someone to look so attractive in a white suit. Jail worthy actually and what she wouldn’t give to see Agatha’s wrists in handcu-</p><p>She’s quickly startled out of her own thoughts when the door to Agatha’s office swings open, Agatha clearing her throat as she does.</p><p>It’s Rio’s turn to attempt to conceal a jaw drop as she takes in Agatha. She’s wearing a tight pink long sleeve sweater that’s tucked into a thigh length brown leather mini skirt.</p><p>And below that are matching knee high boots, which might as well be carrying Rio’s death sentence tucked into them because there is absolutely no way she is going to survive sitting opposite her when she looks this good for a whole hour. She looks down at her own outfit, a brown cropped shirt, blue jeans and converse and realises she’s quite underdressed, deciding she’s got to start dressing better for Agatha.</p><p>No fuck wait not <i>for</i> Agatha, just she should be smarter next time that’s all.</p><p>“You ready?” Agatha questions, nodding towards Rio who stands to her feet, shoving her hands in the pockets of her jeans. Not trusting her own hands for not having a mind of their own as she passes by.</p><p>Rio walks right past her, not daring to look her in the eye and takes her place on the couch again. She notices Agatha has moved it slightly, it seems closer to her chair. But she hides that thought for later. Agatha takes her place, offering Rio coffee or water to which again she declines.</p><p>“How’s things been for you over the past week?” Agatha begins, opening the floor up for Rio to say what’s on her mind.</p><p>Rio sits for a moment, she has a whole script planned out in her head but suddenly feels very nervous. The regret of ignoring the therapist's advice sitting heaving on her chest, knowing she should have listened, should have put herself first just once.</p><p>She chews on her lip, eyes trained on the wall just past Agatha’s shoulders, she could lie. But when her eyes land back on blue ones filled with a quiet understanding Rio thinks better of it.</p><p>“We fucked three times since I was last here,” she blurts, groaning as she throws her head back against the couch in embarrassment. She can almost feel the way Agatha’s eyes of quiet disappointment bore into her soul. Can hear the deep breath she takes before she talks.</p><p>Agatha takes a second, lets the air flow out her lungs quietly, the disappointments not at Rio, but for Rio. “And how was that?” She asks, calm and coolly.</p><p>Rio has no idea what to say. “The same as it always is, I fuck her exactly how she wants it. I make her come and then she rolls over and goes to sleep, no aftercare, no kiss goodnight. Absolutely nothing.”</p><p>Rio is mortified, she knows it’s bad but saying it out loud to a stranger she has some insane fixation on seems to make it ten times worse.</p><p>The room stills for a minute, giving Rio a chance to collect her spiralling thoughts, to prepare for whatever loaded question might be thrown her way.</p><p>“Did she touch you?” Agatha asks, a slight twitch of her lip, close to a snarl, her tone almost possessive but Rio manages to convince her brain she’s imagining all of it. It’s just a silly crush after all.</p><p>Rio nods.</p><p>“I’m interested to know how she touches you, how does it make you feel when she does?” The curiosity in Agatha’s tone startles Rio until she remembers that this is Agatha’s job.</p><p>She’s here to learn about Rio’s sex life and to help her sex life <i>with Hela</i> not to personally give Rio an orgasm.</p><p>“Like shit? She only touched me once but there’s just no effort, she rubs my clit for about a minute before shoving two fingers inside me until she yawns and turns away.”</p><p>She watches Agatha’s eyes roll into the back of her head, she’s not entirely convinced she was meant to spot that. Watches as Agatha startles at her own reaction before fixing her face, biting back something on the tip of her tongue.</p><p>“So it feels like she doesn’t want to touch you?” Agatha asks, “You mentioned last week it feels like an ‘obligation’ for her, is this an example of one of those times?”</p><p>Rio suddenly feels the tears streaming down her face. It takes her by surprise as she’s never imagined showing this level of vulnerability to a stranger. She never lets Hela get to her anymore, used to the morbid routine they’ve gotten themselves into but being able to truly be heard by a stranger means the tears come falling.</p><p>“God yeah. I feel so fucking unwanted. I know I said I like being used for other people’s pleasure,” she sobs, “This is not what I meant, there’s just no passion at all. It’s like a terribly choreographed routine.”</p><p>As Rio talks, Agatha walks over to the mini fridge in the corner, pulling a water bottle out before placing herself beside Rio on the sofa. Through her tears Rio she feels the warmth of Agatha’s presence next to her, patient, understanding.</p><p>Agatha twists the bottle open before handing it to her, placing a comforting hand on Rio’s thigh as she does. Rio lets her breath momentarily hitch, covering it with deep breaths to soothe her sobs.</p><p>“Rio I’m sorry, that sounds like a lot to deal with in your head. Do you need a minute or would you like to keep going?” Agatha says, breaking the silence. Her tone is full of sincerity and concern. Rio wonders how long it’s been since she’s been spoken to like that.</p><p>Rio shudders, her voice breaking as she talks. “Keep going, I don’t want to stop now we’ve started.”</p><p>“As you wish,” Agatha nods. “How do you think it feels, to be wanted? How do you want her to show you that?”</p><p>Rio assumes that Agatha is going to walk back to her seat during their pause in conversation but she just reaches for her notebook and pen before settling back onto the sofa.</p><p>“That about me?” Rio questions, attempting to peer over towards the pages full of notes.</p><p>Agatha nods, pulling the notebook to her chest. “Nice try. Answer my question please.”</p><p>“How do I think it feels? I’ve got no idea. It’s been so long since I think I’ve felt that way. When I first met Hela everything was about <i>us</i>, our future, our relationship but now it’s just about her. I try, god I try so hard to show her she’s wanted, that I want her because I think I do but she doesn’t even attempt to show me I’m wanted, doesn’t attempt to show me that I deserve to be looked after. That what I give to our relationship is enough for her. I should be able to feel that - oh fuck sorry I’m rambling,” Rio stutters over her words.</p><p>“Hey now don’t stop, get it off your chest. This is what I’m here for,” the reassurance in Agatha’s tone causes Rio’s heart to sit in her throat.</p><p>“I can’t describe the way it feels honestly but I’ve felt it before with her and I’m confident I’ve not felt that in a long time,” Rio exhales, the weight on her shoulders lifting slightly.</p><p>“Do you think the ‘want’ is perhaps something that stops you from orgasming during sex?”</p><p>“Yeah… I think that’s probably a big part of it actually but I just don’t feel all that confident in myself right now either so that probably doesn’t help things.”</p><p>Agatha leans back on the sofa, seemingly collecting her thoughts. “Is that because you feel like you can’t express yourself properly with her? It sounds to me that she almost has you at arms length, seeing the parts of you she wants and ignoring the parts of she doesn’t?”</p><p>Rio's eyes light up, it’s almost like Agatha gets her. Can understand where she’s coming from even if all she can do is word vomit at her. “Yeah I guess. You’re right I think.”</p><p>“She treats you as ‘less than’,” Agatha air quotes with her fingers. “Rather than an equal? Perhaps making you feel like you need to hide who you are out of fear that she might want you even less?”</p><p>If Rio’s heart beat any faster at the panic she felt rising, crushing against her ribs at how raw and close to home that question felt as it settled into the room, it might just burst out of her chest.</p><p>Agatha nudges her playfully. “Too much?”</p><p>“No, just painfully accurate,” Rio sighs, turning her head to face Agatha, flashing a grin at the way she notices the therapist focusing back on her notes a bit too quickly, like she was paying more attention than she should have, but it could be another trick of her dangerous thoughts. “I was more feminine when we first met but it was never really ‘me’, it was a facade to please everyone else around me. When I let myself accept that not being ‘me’ anymore I felt free from restrictions I had placed, confident, comfortable.”</p><p>“How did your wife react to the change? The less feminine version of you?”</p><p>“She didn’t, she acted like nothing had changed, like she didn’t want to and I got too scared to ask, scared of what she might reveal, quiet truths are sometimes tougher than loud lies aren’t they?”</p><p>Agatha hums. “So you hide this part of you at home?”</p><p>Rio feels the itch to pick herself up and run. But when lets herself glance to the side again there's no judgement, Agatha looks calm, but there's a quiet battle happening that's only present in the twitch of her fingers as she seems to fight herself to not reach out.</p><p>Rio just groans, she hates that Hela doesn’t try to see her for who she is anymore. The quiet resentment bubbles in her chest, her nails dig into the seat beneath her as she waits for it to stop.</p><p>It doesn’t.</p><p>“She still treats you the version of yourself you have long since left behind? But from what I see and hear, that’s not how you want to be treated?” Agatha queries.</p><p>Rio nods in response, looking Agatha directly in the eyes for the first time in a while. Like if she looks hard enough, Agatha will offer something she shouldn’t want, that she would say yes to without thinking about the consequences. Fuck why can’t she stop these thoughts.</p><p>“If she was to lean into encouraging the masculine side of you that you want her to see, would this change anything for you?” Agatha asks, nudging Rio back into the moment, getting them back on track to why she is here.</p><p>“I- I don’t think I understand what you mean?” Rio furrows her brow.</p><p>Agatha pauses, glancing towards her notes. “For example, it could be small things like if she was to tell you how handsome you look today and how hard working you are. That you deserve to be taken ‘care’ of too, that she wants to be the one to take care of her partner and treat you the way you deserve, just like you do for her but in your own way?”</p><p>
<i>Fuck.</i>
</p><p>Rio’s never heard someone speak about her that way. She sits with those thoughts, deciding that’s exactly how she wants to be spoken to and about. How did Agatha do that? Sure it’s her job but to be able to see through Rio in one session is pretty impressive. Agatha reaches a hand out, rubbing soothing circles against Rio’s thigh.</p><p>“Yeah. Yeah I think I like that, it feels good.”</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow towards her, nodding her head once before she turns to her notebook scribbling down some words.</p><p>“Got it,” she states. “Things like handsome, smart, strong. Would that do anything for you?”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks burn, she turns her focus on the other side of the room, not really sure if she can deny that, yes that absolutely does something for her. <i>Holy shit.</i></p><p>She immediately crosses one leg over the other, squeezing them tightly to attempt to curb the feeling suddenly happening between her thighs. The action has Agatha’s hand slip higher up her thigh and she makes no attempt to move it. Agatha looks back at her for a beat, her bottom lip pulled between her teeth as her eyes search Rio’s face, contemplating something. All Rio can do is watch, swallowing hard as the hand on her thigh comes up to wipe across her tear stained cheeks. She lets her eyes flutter closed at the touch.</p><p>The tension is cut with a clearing of Agatha’s throat as she pulls her hand back into her own lap and snaps her eyes back down to her notes. Rio blows out a long breath and straightens in her seat.</p><p>Agatha taps her pen on the page before turning back to her.</p><p>“Tell me, have you mentioned to your wife that you aren’t orgasming whilst you have sex?”</p><p>Rio chokes on a laugh. “God no, absolutely not a fucking chance.”</p><p>“So what do you do then?”</p><p>“Mmm,” Rio debates whether she’s going to be completely honest or lie. “Fake it I guess?”</p><p>“Fake it? Surely you can’t do that everytime?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“You’re telling me you’ve never faked an orgasm Mrs Sex Therapist?” Rio questions, finally finding her humour again.</p><p>“Miss,” Agatha corrects.</p><p>
<i>Oh.</i>
</p><p>“But surely you can’t be that good at faking it?” Agatha continues.</p><p>Rio hums lightly. “Well I guess, I guess I just- I mean she’s never questioned it so.”</p><p>“Show me,” Agatha grins, placing her hand on Rio’s upper thigh, squeezing it lightly.</p><p>Rio’s jaw hits the floor.</p><p>“I’m kidding, I’m kidding,” Agatha laughs.</p><p>“Oh god of course you are…” Rio responds, she shifts her position on the sofa angling her body to face Agatha more straight on. “You really never had to fake it?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flick down to the hand on her thigh, the tan line from where a ring once was, a reminder somethings just don’t last.</p><p>Agatha smirks, as their eyes meet again. “This isn’t about me.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio grins, satisfied her question has already been answered, still she pouts playfully. “I gotta give and not receive anything back? How tragically fitting.”</p><p>The snort that comes as soon as the jokes land hits Rio square in the chest as she tries to stop her own laughter from following. Failing miserably.</p><p>“Okay I deserved that,” Agatha says through her laughter. “I haven’t had to fake it in a long time. I’d have to be getting laid for that, now can we get back to you?”</p><p>Rio feels her eyebrows shoot up before she can stop them. There’s no way this insanely stunning woman sat next to her isn’t getting fucked senseless by someone.</p><p>Agatha smirks, clearly knowing Rio wants to ask more, a silent dare.</p><p>“How long?” Rio asks, letting out a yelp as Agatha’s notebook slaps against her chest.</p><p>“Do you touch yourself?” Agatha deflects, stifling another laugh as Rio’s hands come up to cover her face as the heat gathers in her cheeks.</p><p>This woman doesn’t beat around the bush and it might be the death of her. Rio is not shy, hell she’s pretty confident but for some reason the thought of sharing what she does alone in the dark with a stranger just seems insanely intimate.</p><p>Rio feels the embarrassment slowly leave her as she peeks through her fingers and is reminded that Agatha has never once judged her, only encouraged and it's clear in the way she looks at Rio with a patient kindness as she waits.</p><p>With a heavy sigh Rio finally answers. “No-, I never really have.” She tries to deflect with a smile and asks. “Do you?”</p><p>“Often,” Agatha replies bluntly, straight to the point and not giving Rio any satisfaction before turning the conversation back to her. “Any reason why?”</p><p>Rio is determined to get more out of this woman, so maybe being honest is how she gets there. Maybe she’ll find out what ‘often’ really means or better yet how she treats herself when the lights go out.</p><p>“I get more pleasure out of touching other people, I’ve never really felt I needed to please myself. I’ve tried to more recently but…”</p><p>Agatha nudges her shoulder lightly, encouraging her. “But?”</p><p>“I still can’t come so I stopped trying, I don’t see the point.”</p><p>Rio huffs out a laugh and rolls her head from side to side out of frustration, tired of being stuck in this endless cycle.</p><p>“Maybe you need to relearn what you and your body enjoy before you are able to find that same pleasure with your sexual partner,” Agatha smiles as Rio’s head tilts back to hers. “Try to shut the world out and focus on you and your desires.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Rio can’t help it when her eyes flick down to Agatha’s lips for a beat too long before they land back on hers again. She can’t help it at the way she feels her lungs start to burn after she realises she was holding her breath hoping she hasn’t been caught.</p><p>“How often?” Rio asks, watching as Agatha bites back another smirk, she clearly had been waiting.</p><p>The briefest flick of Agatha’s eyes to her own lips, no, she’s imagining that.</p><p>“I have a lot of free time,” Agatha finally lets her lips curl up and watches as Rio lets out a long breath, imagination running wild.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat and leans out of Rio’s space as she continues. “I don’t recommend porn to my clients but I do have resources that might be helpful.”</p><p>“So educational porn?” Rio asks, trying not to laugh at the eye roll it gets her. “Sounds great, I am a visual learner.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a dramatic playful sigh before getting to her feet. “I’ll make sure to send the ones that might get you in the mood and teach you a thing or two.”</p><p>“Hey now, who says I need to be taught anything?” Rio gasps, offended. “I have never had any compl-”</p><p>“I’ll see you next week Mrs Vidal,” Agatha breathes out as she opens the door for Rio to leave. As Rio passes she drops her voice lower. “Do be good and take my advice this week, hm?”</p><p>Rio stumbles slightly and turns back to face her, pressing her tongue to cheek and smirking. “Will I get a reward?”</p><p>The door swiftly slams shut leaving Rio smiling like a fool at nothing but the metal name plate screwed into the wood.</p><p>Agatha Harkness plays in a loop in Rio’s mind the whole way home, she would never admit it but she is sure she won’t need those resources at the way she is already throbbing between her thighs.</p><p>The awful part? Rio doesn’t feel an ounce of guilt as she slips into the guest room, and that’s when she knows she’s entirely fucked.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha falls back in her desk chair with a groan, Rio was her last client of the day and honestly thank god for that. Her pulse is still beating rapidly as she grips her pen hard, the entire session might be her most unprofessional yet.</p><p>But fuck was it worth it.</p><p>She tries to write out Rio’s next session plan, she really does try.</p><p>But she can’t, all she can think about is Rio’s eyes floating to her lips, the snarky comments she made towards her that were absolutely flirty.</p><p>All she can think about is Rio.</p><p>So if she slipped a hand beneath her waistband when she was looking for educational videos to send Rio, who can blame her. She didn’t even touch herself to begin with, just held her hand there to soothe the aching between her thighs.</p><p>She scrolls through an abundance of videos on her laptop saved to the folder titled ‘educational resources’, there’s a handful of links that would work but none seem to be exactly what she’s looking for. She’s trying to teach Rio to take care of herself as well as to reach orgasm but there’s just something missing in the videos.</p><p>Eventually she sends herself an email with three links attached so she can text them over to Rio as soon as possible. She pulls her phone from the desk drawer, unsurprisingly the only notification she has is from her favourite delivery app suggesting she order something in.</p><p>Agatha hasn’t used Rio’s number yet, she <i>shouldn’t</i> be texting her at all unless it’s to re-arrange sessions but who gives a fuck. She pastes the links haphazardly, all of a sudden aware of how stuffy her office feels. Removing her hand from below her waistband to avoid any further feelings.</p><p>Agatha is not satisfied with the videos she’s chosen, none of them feel like what Rio needs, none of them feel good enough.</p><p>She could just…</p><p>Wait no she couldn’t, could she?</p><p>There are simply no further thoughts on the matter as she pulls the plant pot from the corner of the desk into the middle, opening the camera on her phone and leaning it against the pot. The angle isn’t quite right so she turns her phone onto its side, angling it down so all that's in the shot is her lower torso and below. She hikes her mini skirt above her hips before placing her leather boot covered legs at either side of the plant pot.</p><p>
<i>Perfect view.</i>
</p><p>She looks good, lace white underwear barely covering her neatly trimmed bush and swollen clit.</p><p>Agatha gasps at the growing wet patch that glares back at her.</p><p>
<i>Oh fuck.</i>
</p><p>She leans forward, clicking the record button before slumping back into her chair. She reaches down slowly, circling her clit over the white lace. The touch is gentle, despite the fact her clit is already throbbing with need for more, <i>throbbing with the need for Rio.</i></p><p>The pace remains slow but her breath hitches louder with every touch, her brain still completely fogged with thoughts of Rio.</p><p>How she’d feel, what she’d say, how she’d touch her. Would she be gentle? Would she be rough? God what she’d give to find out.</p><p>No matter how hard she tries to think of something else, <i>of someone else</i>, she can’t.</p><p>The faster she circles, the wetter she gets turning the lace practically see through so the camera can see everything. The barrier between her hand and clit is almost completely useless. She thinks about the way Rio looked at her earlier, how she could’ve sworn Rio wanted her there and then, right over her desk. She has to pull her bottom lip between her teeth to stop her from moaning Rio’s name over and over again.</p><p>Subconsciously, Agatha takes into consideration that Rio said she didn’t enjoy penetration, so she doesn’t give herself any either in an attempt to show Rio that it’s possible to pleasure yourself without penetration too.</p><p>She’s closer quicker than she would normally like but she doesn’t care. Her eyes haven’t left the screen since she started, the timer reading three minutes thirty eight seconds.</p><p>She’s fucked.</p><p>She’s not sure if it’s mid-orgasm that she realises this as she bites her lip so hard she draws blood or if it’s when she ends the recording and attaches it with the other links and doesn’t even blink when she hits the send button.</p><p>The ‘delivered’ message turns to ‘read’ not even thirty seconds later.</p><p>
<i>Oh fuck. </i>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio is scrolling aimlessly through her tiktok for you feed, the very same feed she has banned herself off ten times in the last month for the unhealthy obsession she has brought on by her own inability to not delete the stupid app.</p><p>She is three minutes into some AI glass fruit video when the text message notification takes over the top of her screen. The number isn’t saved, the preview confirms four attachments but there is no message that follows.</p><p>Usually she would delete something as spam but her finger has already betrayed her as it clicks open the message.</p><p>
<i>God help her.</i>
</p><p>Her phone falls out her hand and slaps her on the chin as her palms get slick with sweat and it’s a fucking preview photo that does that? Fuck she really does need to get laid properly.</p><p>She fumbles to pick it up, sitting straighter as she clicks into the first link and snorts.</p><p><i>’Female Masturbation,</i> is printed along the top of the pdf and as Rio skims through it’s about as riveting as she would expect. She will give Agatha a pass here as since it’s probably mandatory to send it to clients, but she will be giving her a review during their next session.</p><p>As she swipes to the next link it’s a video of a woman fully clothed, talking about orgasming and different techniques to use. Rio rolls her eyes, surely even educational content could be more engaging.</p><p>Another swipe, this time an undressed woman is lying flat on her back, camera pointed to her pussy as she touches herself, again talking through everything she is doing, it’s really not doing it for Rio and no bush like maybe Agatha doesn’t know her at all.</p><p>She groans about to swipe away and reply to her with an eye roll emoji and a thumbs down when the last video, the preview that got her attention stares back at her.</p><p>Fuck it she will give her once last chance.</p><p>Rio feels faint as she presses play and the sharp intake of breath fills her airpods, <i>oh so no talking in this one got it</i>. She watches as gentle fingers work against the thin fabric, soft pants breaking through with every swirl of long fingers as they work with practised care against her clit. Rio’s breathing starts to pick up as she keeps her eyes focused on what's in front of her, something feels familiar but she can’t figure out what.</p><p>It isn’t until she sees the fabric start to soak through and become useless that she lets out a gasp pulling her phone up to her face just to be sure. A quiet moan hits at the same time and Rio has to muffle her own with the back of her hand at the sound.</p><p>“<i>Fuck,</i>” She mutters to herself, her hand reaching for the waistband of her shorts.</p><p>Before she can slip her fingers any further a long drawn out gasp floods her ears and she watches as the arousal threatens to seep through the lace onto the leather underneath her.</p><p>Rio’s fingers work quicker than her brain as they click to replay the video again, focusing on the left hand settled against the pale skin of her thigh and seeing the same tan line that dug into her thigh earlier on today clear as day on her screen.</p><p>“No fucking way,” Rio groans letting her head hit back hard against the pillows.</p><p>Her fingers are already touching the wetness between her thighs before she can even catch up, she bites back a moan at how much her body has reacted to a three minute video.</p><p>She watches more closely this time, listens to every sound pulled out of that beautiful mouth that she can’t see but picture perfectly in her mind as she moves her own fingers with the same precision against her clit. The volume is on as high as it can go but god does she wish she could play it out for everyone to hear, perfect grunts mixed with the sound of fingers working against the soaked fabric and knowing exactly who’s pressed against that chair has Rio’s orgasm building perfectly. She’s not felt this way in what feels like years as the warmth crawls up her spine and low in her stomach, her chest almost heaving as she fights to not let her own sounds break through the silent room.</p><p>The long gasp hits her again, this time right against her throbbing cunt as she picks up her pace and lets the video start again as she flips onto her stomach, phone settled on the pillows. She traps her hand between her and the bed and works faster.</p><p>Agatha floods every one of her senses.</p><p>The feel of her hands lingering against her thigh, the sound of her breathing in her ears as she gets closer and closer to climax, the sight of her aching pussy just asking to be touched by different hands, <i>her hands.</i> The only things missing are the smell of her and the taste of her. Rio groans at the thought of what it might be like, but it's not enough she needs to know, wants to know what she would taste like as she lands warm on her tongue.</p><p>Rio gasps as her thoughts are only Agatha, her name on the tip of her tongue as she feels the long lost feeling of an orgasm threatening to rip through her, she bites into the pillow beneath her to stifle the scream sitting in her lungs that she knows is coming.</p><p>Her fingers have lost all rhythm working for one purpose and fuck does it feel good, everything feels so fucking good.</p><p>“Oh fu-”</p><p>“WHAT THE FUCK?”</p><p>Rio jolts back, her phone thankfully lands face down as she scrambles onto her knees, soaked fingers hidden shamefully at her side. She looks up at her wife standing in the doorway, jaw slack as she lets her eyes take in what she has walked in on.</p><p>“Rio, what the absolute fuck?”</p><p>—</p><p>“Mrs Vidal,” Agatha stands at the door, startling Rio out of her thoughts.</p><p>If her thoughts are only on exactly what is going on underneath those brown trousers of the woman that stands in front of her, who can honestly blame her. The use of ‘Mrs’ makes her involuntarily shiver, but she pushes herself from the armchair in the waiting room and towards the door.</p><p>“Good week?” Agatha asks as Rio dramatically drops onto the sofa, kicking her doc martens onto the cushions.</p><p>“Mmm had it worse,” Rio decides that she’s going to try her damn hardest to not look Agatha in the eye for the entire session. She doesn’t want Agatha to know how many times she’s watched <i>that</i> video on repeat, how she has the moans memorised, and knows exactly the movements Agatha fingers make that cause her to come.</p><p>That her own fingers have followed the same pattern and yet she can only keep dreaming about them tracing the same movements on skin that isn’t her own.</p><p>Agatha sighs. “Make yourself at home I guess,” her hands gesturing dramatically towards Rio before she takes a seat at her desk.</p><p>Rio holds the silence. She certainly isn’t going to be the one to bring up the videos.</p><p>“Did you do your homework?” Agatha muses, her voice drips like honey in Rio’s ears.</p><p>“Mhm, of course I did. I’m the perfect student.”</p><p>Rio turns her head to the side, looking towards Agatha but not <i>at</i> her.</p><p>Agatha hums lightly. “Good, I’m so glad to hear it. Tell me about it, how did you get on?”</p><p>“Tell you how I touched myself?” Rio chokes out, desperate to see Agatha’s reaction.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Fuck Rio did not expect that.</p><p><i>Oh my god it’s because you’re paying her a ridiculously expensive hourly rate to fix your sex life, not because she wants to know all the personal details of how you fucked yourself.</i> She silently scolds herself whilst deciding how honest she’s going to be with Agatha.</p><p>“Well some of those videos could do with a little work to be honest, but hey who am I to judge,” Rio laughs to herself.</p><p>Agatha ignores Rio, tilting her head down and looking at Rio over the top of her large framed glasses. “Did you touch yourself to them?” her voice treading carefully.</p><p>“Yeah I did, just the once though,” Rio eventually admits.</p><p>“And? How did it feel? Work with me here Rio please.”</p><p>“Honestly? Amazing? I haven’t felt pleasure like that in a <i>really</i> long time, but then I just,” Rio’s voice drops quietly at the end of her sentence, turning her head back to look at the ceiling.</p><p>Agatha is quick to jump in, her curiosity peaking. “What happened?”</p><p>“Hela walked in on me and lost her fucking mind, just as I think I was maybe about to come? I don’t know I haven’t been able to do it since,” Rio sighs, running a hand through her hair.</p><p>A loud snap causes Rio to jolt up, spinning herself round to face Agatha sitting at her desk with two snapped pencils in her hand.</p><p>“Oops,” Agatha shrugs before tossing the broken pencils into the trash can. “And what did she say? What could have possibly led her to losing her mind over something so normal?”</p><p>Rio attempts to reason with her. “I think she just got in her head, she was all like ‘Am I not good enough for you?’, I think she just couldn’t understand why I was doing it.”</p><p>“You have got to be fucking kidding me,” Agatha mutters under her breath.</p><p>“She just couldn’t get her head round that when she was waiting for me next door telling me that I shouldn’t need to do all that because I have a wife, that's what she’s there for.”</p><p>“And how did that make you feel, Rio?”</p><p>Rio scoffs, dropping her head into her hands and resting her elbows against her knees. “Worthless. Like I don’t deserve to experience any form of pleasure unless she’s the one giving it to me.”</p><p>Rio misses Agatha reaching into her desk drawer to grab a packet of tissues and walks over to where she is sitting. She misses when Agatha brings one to the corner of her eyes to catch the tears that are forming before they run down her cheeks.</p><p>“Just numb I guess. I felt disgusted afterwards, full of shame. Like I know it’s not a disgusting thing but she makes me feel like it is.”</p><p>“Rio, god I am so sorry, that is a <i>lot</i> to deal with and absolutely not the intended outcome of the homework.”</p><p>Rio listens to every word Agatha says, she’s sure she’s never heard compassion and understanding towards her like this before. “It’s not your fault, it’s just how Hela is. I’ve come to terms with it by now, hell I don’t even know why I’m trying to change her ways.”</p><p>“It’s absolutely astounding to me that this bitch-” Agatha’s hand flies over her mouth with a sharp inhale. “It’s absolutely insane to me that your <i>wife</i> is a marriage counselor.”</p><p>“Ironic isn’t it?” Rio chuckles, attempting to make light of the situation.</p><p>The worst part is that Hela comes highly recommended but can’t even see when her own marriage is starting to crack or maybe she can and just doesn’t care enough about Rio to make any effort to stop it from crumbling to the ground.</p><p>“Fucking insane if you want my honest opinion.”</p><p>Rio laughs through her tears. “God you must think I’m such a baby, all I do is sit here and cry.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha says, her tone firm but soft. “Look at me, there is nothing wrong with wanting to make yourself feel good. She doesn’t get to take that away from you because she can’t own up to whatever insecurities she’s battling with.”</p><p>Rio finds that familiar sense within her chest rising again, a sense of understanding her, a sense of someone accepting her.</p><p>Agatha continues. “She doesn’t get to steal every ounce of good you get to feel, you <i>deserve</i> to feel it, god please believe me when I say you deserve it all. She takes so much from you, <i>of you</i>, it’s time for you to take something back.”</p><p>At this moment, Rio has absolutely nothing to say. Once again speechless at the level of understanding that Agatha is showing her, how badly she wants Rio to believe that she deserves good things.</p><p>“Do- do you really believe that?” Rio eventually asks.</p><p>“Believe what?”</p><p>“Believe that I deserve good things? Believe that I deserve to take things back?”</p><p>“More than anything,” Agatha replies, nodding towards Rio.</p><p>They both sit with the comfortable silence for a few minutes, neither of them sure where to direct the session from here. Rio just waits it out, watching as she settles back in her chair, hoping that Agatha will close the session early or take the reins from her soon.</p><p>Eventually Agatha sighs, leaning forward onto her elbows against the desk. “Tell me then, forget all about Hela, let’s get back to you.”</p><p>
<i>Thank god, no more Hela.</i>
</p><p>“Do we always have to talk about me? What if we talk about you?” Rio says, making a poor attempt to switch the conversation.</p><p>“And why would we talk about me huh? We are here for your sex life not mine, remember.”</p><p>Rio pulls the cushion sitting beside her onto her lap, smiling wide as she plans to wind Agatha up even further now that the attention isn’t on her, for now.</p><p>“Well how about I do your role and you do mine? Just for a minute, come on,” Rio pouts.</p><p>“Maybe one day you’ll get to know more about my sex life, but for now, tell me again how did it feel when you were touching yourself?”</p><p>
<i>Damn well worth a shot!</i>
</p><p>“I mean I already kinda told you, it felt really good.”</p><p>“Talk me through it, tell me what you did,” Agatha prompts.</p><p>Rio’s mouth gapes, realising that Agatha wants her to actually tell her how she did it. “I just copied the woman in the video, she didn’t penetrate herself which worked for me. I couldn’t believe how turned on I was.”</p><p>“How wet did it get you?” Agatha wastes no time with her questions, firing them straight back at Rio.</p><p>“Probably the most I have been in my entire marriage with Hela and it wasn’t even over her,” Rio laughs awkwardly as she watches the corners of Agatha’s mouth pull up.</p><p>Neither of them are willing to discuss the elephant in the room. Agatha shifts uncomfortably in her seat and Rio can see her crossing her legs beneath the desk.</p><p>
<i>Wait. Is this turning her on? Two can play this game.</i>
</p><p>Rio ramps up the dramatics instantly. “God it felt <i>so</i> good, I kept myself on the edge, teasing myself. Allowing myself to get worked up, god if Hela hadn’t burst in I probably would’ve come on the spot.”</p><p>Agatha squirms in her seat, clearly feeling the impact of Rio’s words. So Rio continues.</p><p>“And oh god,” she fake moans, “I was <i>so</i> wet, I couldn’t contain myself and the video was perfect. <i>She</i> was perfect, exactly what I needed to see.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen as she clears her throat. “A-anything else to add?”</p><p>“Yeah actually,” Rio states, finally having some of her confidence back despite her brief breakdown earlier. “There was just something missing.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“The hands, the ones in the video, I just- I wonder what they would’ve felt like on me,” Rio begins to explain, dropping her voice lower. “I’ve been dreaming about them and I know that’s probably a terrible thing to admit given I’ve got a wife and all but I can’t stop thinking about them.”</p><p>Agatha’s face flushes instantly. “<i>Oh.</i> And- well tell me how you imagined them? You know so we can maybe figure out how to help you next time you want to pleasure yourself?”</p><p>“The list is truly endless,” Rio smirks. “On me, in me, round my neck, in my hair, gripping into the sheets, nails biting into the skin on my back.”</p><p>Rio is working herself up just as bad as she talks.</p><p>“Mmm for sure. Well I certainly think you need to continue with the homework I set you,” Agatha muses, clearing her throat. “Perhaps try it somewhere more private? You clearly want this, so give yourself a chance to have it.”</p><p>“Oh I don’t think I’ll ever have exactly what I want right now,” Rio mutters under her breath.</p><p>Agatha suddenly pushes herself off from her desk. “Well that’s time.”</p><p>Rio spots a small bead of sweat drip onto her forehead as she stands up to shake Agatha’s hand. “Same time next week?”</p><p>“Mhm,” Agatha hums, gripping Rio’s hand tightly as she leans in a little closer. “Now be a good boy for me and make sure you do all your homework for next week, mkay?” Agatha gestures Rio towards the door.</p><p>
<i>Check fucking mate. One point Agatha.</i>
</p><p>Rio is sure she momentarily loses consciousness at the words leaving Agatha's mouth, her ears ringing them repeatedly.</p><p>She clears her throat. “Oh-, god yeah of course sure I will, y-yes ma’am” she replies, tripping over every single syllable. Rio practically runs towards the door, trying to gain some form of composure before she leaves. Agatha scoffs proudly, following behind Rio to hold the door open.</p><p>“See you next week Dr Harkness,” Rio eventually teases, finally looking Agatha in the eye as she steps closer, voice dropping to a whisper. “Oh and if you have any more of those ‘educational resources’, send them my way.”</p><p>“She’s unavailable,” Agatha shoots back.</p><p>Rio says nothing, just smirks whilst making sure her eyes dart to Agatha’s lips before turning away and heading down the staircase.</p><p>She’s on cloud nine after that session, the sun shines on her walk home as she almost skips her way through the front door.</p><p>Her wife isn’t taking up a single thought in her mind until she wanders into the kitchen humming lightly to herself and she spots Hela leaning over the hob, the smell of cooking suddenly flooding Rio’s senses.</p><p>
<i>Wait she’s cooking?</i>
</p><p>Hela hadn’t cooked for Rio in at least a year, she was almost taken aback by it. She forces her feet to carry her over, pushing every single thought she has about Agatha and <i>that</i> session to the back of her mind, locking that compartment of her brain closed.</p><p>She leans her chin against Hela’s shoulder, wrapping her hands around her waist lightly.</p><p>“Mmm smells good, what are you making?” Rio asks quietly.</p><p>Surprisingly Hela leans into her touch, “Your favourite.”</p><p>Rio is confused, Hela hasn’t cooked in over a year let alone made Rio’s favourite, what is going on and what has got her in this good mood?</p><p>“Thanks babe,” Rio replies, “Let me get the bowls out, good day?”</p><p>“Oh fuck yeah it was, we signed a huge corporate sponsorship for the clinic that’s gonna get me a lovely bonus at the end of the year and now I’m at home cooking for my beautiful wife,” Hela giggles, still not turning from the hob to look at Rio.</p><p>
<i>Beautiful.</i>
</p><p>Rio hates that word.</p><p>It’s not her, doesn’t feel like her anymore.</p><p>Her mind floods with the thoughts of Agatha’s conversation and suggestions that she <i>needs</i> to talk to Hela about how she feels in order for this to go anywhere. So she gathers that there’s no time like the present, especially when Hela seems to be in good spirits.</p><p>Rio pulls a beer from the fridge, cracking it open before settling at the table. She tries not to let the silence linger too long.</p><p>She sighs. “Look I’ve been thinking.”</p><p>“Uh oh, never a good sign when you use that brain of yours,” Hela laughs, interrupting her.</p><p>Rio shakes off the snarky comment before continuing.</p><p>“I just think, that maybe sometimes I’d prefer it if you used some more, I don’t know masculine terms towards me?” she taps her fingers against her beer bottle lightly, awaiting a response.</p><p>The wooden spoon clangs against the pan as Hela whips round to look at Rio, standing with her back against the counter and folding her arms dramatically. “Oh for god sake like what?”</p><p>Well shit, maybe Hela’s mood wasn’t good enough for this conversation.</p><p>Rio grips the neck of the bottle harder, “I don’t really know but even just calling me handsome instead of beautiful, I think I’d prefer that.”</p><p>Rio <i>knows</i> she prefers that, knew she preferred it as soon as Agatha spoke about her that way.</p><p>“And why would I do that?” Hela rolls her eyes, “Are you a man?”</p><p>“No,” Rio states matter of factly.</p><p>“Well then why would I do that? If I wanted to call someone handsome or anything remotely masculine I would’ve married a man.”</p><p>Rio sighs, she can feel her eyes brimming with tears. “It’s not fucking like that, I don’t want to be a man. I just feel more myself when I’m more masculine presenting and thought if you could talk to me that way too things would get better for us.”</p><p>“Better for us?” Hela raises her voice. “What the fuck do you mean? Things were fine between us until you started suggesting all this crap, you’re a fucking woman Rio. I married you because I’m into beautiful women, not men.”</p><p>“Hela I’m not a man jesus fucking christ, I thought we were meant to discuss these things. To speak about when we wanted to try new things out or make things better for each other?” Rio sobs, the tears now flowing freely down her cheeks.</p><p>Hela pushes herself off from the counter, beginning to pace back and forward. “Oh my god and now you’re crying, you always do this. This day was supposed to be about me, I signed a huge contract. Do you even understand what a big deal that is for me, for us?”</p><p>“Of course I do and I’m so happy for you I am,” Rio lies.</p><p>“So why are you doing this, turning on the water works? It’s like you’re trying to piss me off with all this masculine shit. I put up with you wearing a suit to the wedding because you cried hard enough, is this what you’re trying to do here?”</p><p>“Hela, Hela please don’t,” the weight of Rio’s sobs causes her voice to crack.</p><p>“<i>Hela please don’t</i>,” she mocks, “How about Rio please don’t huh? I’m cooking for us, to have a nice night celebrating, we’d watch a film, fuck and then go to bed. But no, you fucking ruined that.”</p><p>Rio just stares at her wife as she throws things around the counter, turning the dials to switch the hob off. She grabs the pan aggressively, tossing the pasta she’d been cooking straight into the bin before dropping the pan back on the counter.</p><p>“Fuck you Rio,” she says, walking towards the door of the kitchen. “You’re fucking selfish, thank you <i>so</i> fucking much for ruining what should’ve been a perfect night for me.”</p><p>She slams the kitchen door on the way out and Rio listens to her storm up the stairs before she hears the slam of their bedroom door. The slam causes Rio to exhale a breath she didn’t realise she’d been holding, slumping back against the kitchen chair.</p><p>Rio pulls the beer bottle to her lips, cleaning it off in one go. She pushes herself off the table before following in Hela’s footsteps upstairs. She reaches for the bedroom door handle, she should go inside and attempt to fix things with Hela.</p><p>She should. But she doesn’t. She doesn’t even want to look at Hela. The fear that her eyes might give away more than she intends. She is tired of being the one to attempt to fix things that shouldn’t need to be fixed, part of her knew it couldn’t have gone any other way. She curses at the part of herself that thought it could have gone differently.</p><p>There’s a small part of her that needed another reason and that part gives a small sigh of relief but the anxiety of making such a decision presses against her chest as she lingers in the hallway.</p><p>Her hand drops from the handle as she moves down the corridor, belining for the spare room again. Rio throws herself against the bed, pulling her phone from her pocket. She unlocks it to a text from Agatha.</p><p>
<b>Sex(y) Therapist: Get the chance to test anything out yet?</b>
</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Was this strictly a professional check in or did Agatha have ulterior motives here?</p><p>So she types back, the beer she just downed beginning to fog her thoughts.</p><p>
<b>
<i>Ha no. Shit happened with Hela, tried to talk to her but god she blew up. She just doesn’t understand me. Not the way you do anyways.</i>
</b>
</p><p>She sends it without another thought, tossing her phone to the side of her before turning towards the wall and eventually falling asleep.</p><p>Her thoughts absolutely should’ve been filled with the conversation about Hela, about how the woman she married is never going to let her express herself the way she wants. How everything is falling apart right in front of her fucking face.</p><p>But instead her thoughts are filled with only Agatha.</p><p>Agatha who is her sex therapist.</p><p>Agatha who is definitely not her wife.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio’s week has been anything but enjoyable. Between the endless snide comments between her and her wife, the sleepless nights tossing and turning about the fact she isn’t sure there is any clawing their way back from this torturous cycle they are in.</p><p>She has taken up residence in their guest bedroom since the kitchen incident, neither of them making the effort to sit down and talk about where they go from here.</p><p>As much as the conversation they had got her nothing from her wife, it did make her realise she has a voice. A voice she needs to use more often, one she needs to use to be more assertive and not just to beg for scraps.</p><p>She’s so tired of holding herself back, hiding who she is, not being able to be proud of what she has achieved. She should be allowed to feel that, be able to look in the mirror and love who she sees staring back at her.</p><p>She has struggled with that for so long, not anymore.</p><p>On top of that she can’t get Agatha out of her mind, every second thought is her.</p><p>The gentleness of her voice when she is trying to pull honesty out of Rio, how she could see parts of her that she kept locked up out of fear but she didn’t need to be afraid of them spilling out with her.</p><p>How protective she gets when Hela is mentioned, Rio truly believes that Agatha could see Hela for who she is in seconds, so why has it taken Rio so long? The murderous glint in Agatha’s eyes when they talk about her shouldn’t be hot but we can’t all be normal and sane all the time so Rio likes to think about that as she lets her eyes flicker closed.</p><p>Her favourite part is how flushed Agatha got when Rio told her what she has been dreaming about. Her clenched jaw as she listened to what Rio would let her do to her, the sweat building on her brow at the thought of how wet she got over just her fingers. It is driving her feral.</p><p>Every second thought just on how she can keep seeing all of that again and again and maybe she can get through this shit show of a week.</p><p>She tries to shake the thoughts but they are better than any others she has been having.</p><p>Hela’s words from the night before are still heavy in the air as she makes her way to Agatha’s office, she’s early but can’t imagine being anywhere else right now.</p><p>
<i>“You don’t get to want more Rio, this is it, this is what you get from me. I don’t know what has got you wanting more or thinking you deserve to get that but it won’t be from me. You are so lucky to have what we have, surely you can see how lucky you are?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You think I should feel lucky? That this is what you call ‘lucky’?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Who else is going to give you half of what I have given you Rio? You were nothing before me and look at you now, your own company, a home, a life.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I did that myself, you do not get to take that from me too, my work is mine, you have nothing to do with that. I paid the down payment for this fucking house. I will always be something with or without you. You think you give me so much but I think you are scared, you’ve realised that it's always been me that gives and gives and gives and all you do is take.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Without me? You would never leave me.”</i>
</p><p>Rio has never felt so unlucky in her life. She has never felt so torn apart. Was Hela right, would she stay? Would Rio ever realise how badly she needed to leave?</p><p>So much for fixing her sex life. She couldn’t imagine anything worse than a moment of weakness that had her crawling back into those tainted sheets.</p><p>She’d much prefer a lobotomy and a strong fucking drink at this point.</p><p>As she is about to make her way up the stairs with a long drawn out sigh, she is pushed to the side and a flash of red hair storms past her.</p><p>“Excuse fucking me I guess,” Rio mutters to herself, before continuing her journey, just catching the red head as she steps into Agatha’s office.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha has been enjoying a rare free hour before her next session with Rio which has had her losing sleep, countless nights with a wine glass in hand as she paces her house trying to drown out the thought of Rio coming undone for her. Nothing is strong enough and she should be more ashamed of the amount of times she has landed with a crash on her bed with her hand between her thighs when the thoughts get too much.</p><p>But she is reminded that she is a magnet for wanting things she cannot have as her office door opens with a force only a bitter ex-wife can manage.</p><p>
<i>Great.</i>
</p><p>“I seriously hope you aren’t hoping to book a session in,” Agatha slumps down in her chair as she watches her stride across the room. “I will slit my throat in front of you if you even say his name.”</p><p>Wanda snorts. “You do love making things messier than they need to be.” She drops into the seat in front of her desk, lips curling into a grin. “You’ve been ignoring my calls. We need to finalise the last of the divorce agreements and that requires us to actually talk to each other.”</p><p>“My lawyer sent yours an email last week. Everything is there, there is no need for us to talk to each other. I have nothing to say,” Agatha taps her pen on the wood before gesturing towards the door. “So you can leave, please do close the door on the way out.”</p><p>“Agatha…” Wanda leans forward in the chair trying to meet her eye but Agatha can feel the familiar curl of anger building in her chest at how easily Wanda forgets how much pain she caused. “Agatha, fucking hell I know you hate me but we can be civil about this, or try to be.”</p><p>Agatha laughs cruelly as she stands up from her seat and rounds the desk. “Civil? If you wanted this to end amicably you could have handed me the divorce papers a year earlier before opening your legs <i>again</i> for whoever was willing. Hell two years earlier would have been better after you stopped wanting to fuck me.”</p><p>“You-”</p><p>“No. You’ve done enough, I put up with being your second choice for years Wanda, you don’t get to come in here and ruin my day because you think you deserve my time, you lost that privilege so please get the fuck out of my office.”</p><p>“Fifteen fucking years and you won’t even have a five minute conversation with me?”</p><p>“You’ve already had three minutes of my time  and it has ruined the perfectly good week I have been having. I should be locked up for lasting fifteen years because there is clearly something wrong with me,” Agatha bends down until her face is barely an inch from Wanda’s. “Get the fuck out of my office before I change my mind and take you for everything you’ve got.”</p><p>“I’m pregnant,” Wanda blurts right back into Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha steps back, reaching for something to hold onto. “What?” she whispers, suddenly having lost all power behind her voice.</p><p>“I’m pregnant Agatha, two months, I just thought I should have the decency to tell you in person.”</p><p>“Decency?” Agatha scoffs, “What the fuck do you know about decency?”</p><p>Agatha’s head spins, she cannot believe what she’s hearing. This would have been the last thing she thought she would ever have to hear.</p><p>“Agatha please, look it was never going to work out for us that way and it just happened to work out for me a different way, I’m sorry,” Wanda says with confidence like she thinks it solves everything. The tone in her voice sends Agatha over the edge.</p><p>“Eight years we spent trying to get pregnant, eight fucking years. Endless hours we spent in that hospital trying to make a family and you just fuck off and get pregnant with the first man you see. Oh my god, do you realise how fucking insane this is?” Agatha yells, walking back round to sit at her desk. She’s convinced that if she doesn’t sit down she’ll pass out.</p><p>“It wasn’t the first man I saw, it’s Vision’s.”</p><p>“Oh of fucking course, the man you were sleeping with whilst our marriage was falling apart has made all your dreams come true! I should’ve seen that coming huh?” Agatha spits, hot tears of rage spilling from her eyes.</p><p>Wanda just stares at her. “I should’ve known you’d act like this, you’ve always been such a fucking brat.”</p><p>“Oh well forgive me, should we go and pick out a stroller now?”</p><p>“Look Agatha I-”</p><p>“No. Don’t fucking ‘look Agatha’ me. Eight years of our lives we spent trying to have a baby, how many failed IVF attempts was it again? Five? Six? How many fucking miscarriages did we have? And not once. Not fucking once did you offer to try and carry a baby for us and now you just show up here and think I’ll throw your fucking baby shower,” Agatha yells, standing from her desk. “I don’t want to <i>ever</i> see your face again. Get the fuck out of my office, seriously. “</p><p>“Agatha please I just want to talk,” Wanda pleads, the fake vulnerability in her voice knocks Agatha sick.</p><p>“You lost the right to talk to me the first time you cheated on me, I was just to blind to uphold it. Now get out, please,” Agatha walks towards the door, gripping the handle like it was her lifeline.</p><p>“Some things truly never change, god knows why I stuck by you for three years let alone fifteen,” Wanda snorts, walking towards the door.</p><p>Agatha looks her in the eyes for what she prays will be the final time. “Why you stuck by me? Oh Wanda, do please enlighten me as to where you were when I was miscarrying our child?”</p><p>Wanda blinks. “Agatha come on I thought you were over this.”</p><p>Agatha yanks the door open. “Wanda I’ll never get over you being in yet another man’s bed whilst I was in a hospital in the middle of nowhere losing our child. That is something I’ll <i>never</i> forgive you for. Now fuck off.”</p><p>And Wanda doesn’t say another word, she just walks down the spiral staircase in silence. Agatha drops against the door, head sinking into her hands as she suddenly has the worst headache in the world. Her ears ring as her heart sits like a lump in her throat.</p><p>“...I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Agatha’s head jolts up as a gentle hand is placed on her shoulder. “Oh my god Rio, fuck” she sniffs. “When did you get here?”</p><p>“About fifteen minutes ago, I got off site early so I just figured I’d sit here till you were ready,” Rio shrugs, she kneels down in front of her with a soft smile. “Can I help you up?”</p><p>She offers Agatha a hand, gentle brown eyes track her face as she waits for Agatha to take it, when she does her thumb brushes against the back of knuckles briefly before standing up and helping her to her feet.</p><p>Agatha holds Rio’s hand for a beat before dropping it and heading to sit on the sofa. “So you heard most of that then?” Agatha laughs lightly.</p><p>“Yeah, all of it. God she sounds worse than Hela and I didn’t think that was possible,” Rio says, sitting beside her on the couch. She crosses her legs so she’s facing Agatha directly. “Look if you don’t want to do my session today I totally get it we can reschedule if you need to be alone.”</p><p>Agatha does not want to be alone right now, after spending so many nights alone after similar conversations she would much prefer to keep being looked at by those stupid big brown eyes for as long as possible.</p><p>“No, stay. Please?” Agatha pleads, trying to push back her own problems so she can think of anything else. “We should discuss your week, hopefully it was better than whatever the fuck that was?”</p><p>Rio snorts. “Do you have a secret stash of alcohol in one of these cupboards?”</p><p>“That bad?”</p><p>“Terribly so, I might need an extension on that homework you set me,” Rio grins, clearly trying to lighten the mood. “Can we pause the session and just talk? Surely even you need to talk sometimes.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a huffed laugh before shaking her head. “I’m here to help you Rio, we will talk about you. What happened this week?”</p><p>Part of her absolutely would love to just find out more about Rio, let her know things about her too but she can’t blur the lines, she already heard too much.</p><p>She watches as Rio resigns, slumping back on the seat facing across the room, like she wants to be honest but isn’t ready to face what that honesty might really show. Agatha waits, doesn’t push but knows something has changed in the way Rio looks tired but lighter.</p><p>“Do you ever feel like it would just be easier if you could just disappear?” Rio asks quietly.</p><p>
<i>Yes.</i>
</p><p>“Would it solve anything?” Agatha replies, leaning back to and dropping her head onto the couch cushion. There's no need for notes today, every word this woman speaks will echo in her mind for weeks. “Do you want to run away from it?”</p><p>Rio chews on her lip before speaking. “I think it would be fine for awhile but the pain would still linger, it would seep out in little ways without me realising but then it would be too late. I don’t think I would heal the same that way. So no it wouldn’t solve anything but sometimes running is less scary.”</p><p>“What scares you Rio?”</p><p>“The truth? That I have to admit I have let myself live in a lie for years before realising that I should never have let myself settle for the bare minimum. That all it took was an hour of your time for me to see how I have let myself be treated? That’s scary, scary that I never once allowed myself to see that I wasn’t the problem, scary that I could have spent more years being a version of myself that I can’t look at in the mirror.”</p><p>Agatha swallows hard, a quiet resentment that no one ever was that person for her. No one ever caught her by the arm and said ‘hey wait you can have more than this y’know? You deserve something better.’</p><p>“What happened this week that let it sink in?” Agatha asks, letting her hand fall to rest next to Rio’s head, her fingers twitching against the fabric to reach out, for comfort for her or Rio she isn’t quite sure.</p><p>“That’s the thing, nothing big happened for me to go ‘oh shit my wife is an awful person’, I feel like a part of me knew that already. I was just too scared to see I deserved more than that, thought what I had was enough and I was okay with that. But I’m not. I think I finally just let myself believe that I deserved better, deserved to wake up and know that I am doing things for myself and if someone is proud of me at the end of the day they will tell me and if someone loves me they will tell me that too.”</p><p>Rio gives her an awkward shy smile as she tilts her head to face her again, the move has her head brushing against Agatha’s fingers and she lets them settle there.</p><p>“You are so fucking strong Rio, do you know how long it can take someone to find that courage to look themselves in the eye and tell themselves they deserve something more?” Agatha says softly, her throat catching as she bites back the sudden need to sob at how she waited fifteen years to realise the same thing. “You do deserve all of that and more.”</p><p>“Did you really have no one in your corner back then?” Rio finally asks, like she had seen an opportunity and had to take it before Agatha builds whatever walls she has let down back up.</p><p>“No,” Agatha sighs, letting her free hand play with a loose thread as she works up the nerve to be honest. Rio really did have that look that just says ‘you can trust me.’ “I didn’t have anyone when we first met, I thought that she was everything I could have needed, too blinded by the life we built to see the cracks forming. Too caught up in wanting so much to start seeing when cracks started to bleed out and too hurt to let go until I couldn’t take anymore.”</p><p>Rio shuffles closer to her on the couch, a warm hand coming to rest on her own, grounding her. Agatha’s eyes flicker open and she smiles at the look of pure understanding staring right back at her and she wants nothing more than to show Rio that she doesn’t deserve to be looked at like that. Doesn’t deserve her pity. But she can’t because she doesn’t know if it's true anymore, she doesn’t want it to be true because maybe she does deserve it.</p><p>“What made you leave?”</p><p>“I was tired of feeling so alone,” Agatha can feel the tears settling on her cheeks as she says it. The loss, the heartbreak, the emptiness flooding back into her and she lets the tears fall, too tired to stop them. “I thought I deserved all the pain that we went through, but living in it alone when I shouldn’t have had to, it was too much. I wanted to believe I deserved more.”</p><p>She hadn’t noticed Rio move as she babbled on, it isn’t until she feels those same warm hands land gently on her thighs as Rio kneels in front of her with a tissue and she laughs, embarrassed that she has just told all of this to a client she met 3 weeks ago.</p><p>“I bet this wasn’t the role reversal you had hoped for,” Agatha jokes as she tries to stifle the tears but they just keep coming.</p><p>“I am sorry you had to go through that Agatha and for so long,” Rio brings a hand up to catch the tears before they drip onto her lap. “You really did and do deserve more than that. You called me strong? But fifteen years is a long time and you are still standing, not many people could survive that.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest feels heavy with the weight of such a statement, she looks at Rio to see if there is any sign of her being deceitful or just saying something for the sake of being kind, but all she can see is pure vulnerable honesty staring back at her.</p><p>“I don’t know if I do,” Agatha whispers, barely audible.</p><p>Rio leans in closer and lets her hand settle against Agatha’s cheek and tilts her so she has to look at her again. “You do.”</p><p>Call it a moment of weakness, pure greed or the undeniable want that has been coursing through her for weeks either way she can’t stop herself as she leans into the touch. Rio’s face barely a breath away and the heaviness of their conversation lingering in that space.</p><p>It wouldn’t take much, it really doesn’t as she lets herself fill the gap and her tear stained lips brush against the warmth of Rio’s, her pulse beating hard against the palm of Rio’s hand as she presses her hold a little harder and attempts to pull Agatha closer.</p><p>She wants to, she wants nothing more than to lean back in and let Rio devour her but she can’t, she shouldn’t, she isn’t something she can have.</p><p>As Rio’s lips brush against hers again, Agatha whispers against them. “We can’t do this.”</p><p>“But I want this” Rio pleads, her hand still pressed to her skin like if she lets go she won’t get another chance at letting the truth spill out.</p><p>Agatha almost lets her lean back in, it would be so easy but as Rio leans in she knows she can’t, so she stands letting Rio stumble back, letting the hand fall from her cheek and ignores the regret in her gut as she walks to the door.</p><p>“That shouldn’t have happened, I can’t see you anymore,” Agatha says quietly as she opens the door, she lets her eyes focus on her feet as Rio approaches, can’t stand to see the look of disappointment waiting for her.  “I’ll recommend you to someone else.”</p><p>“Agath-”</p><p>“No you came here to fix your sex life with your wife not ruin it, you should stop seeing me. I need you to leave Rio, I’m sorry.”</p><p>She doesn’t watch Rio leave, afraid if she looks she will call out and ask her to come right back.</p><p>The weight of the day crashes against her as the door clicks shut, she lets herself slide down the door and wraps her arms around her knees.</p><p>Did she really deserve more?</p><p>—</p><p>Rio settles in the guest room again, she can’t face her wife after the realisations she has been having and hasn't had the courage to let that spill out just yet.</p><p>Her head hasn’t stopped spinning, Agatha’s face flashing in her mind. The look in her eyes when she told Rio to leave. God that’s something Rio will never forget.</p><p>She isn’t even sure it was regret in Agatha’s eyes, something far deeper that maybe said ‘I need you but I can’t have you.’</p><p>But Agatha kissed her.</p><p>Agatha had leaned down and kissed her, surely that had to mean something.</p><p>God she hoped it meant something because it meant something to her, it shouldn’t have been that easy to lean in and want more but it was. It was so fucking easy and if she was braver she would pick herself up and go make that decision for herself. If she was braver she would scream at the top of her lungs that she knows who she is and what she deserves and she wouldn’t let anyone take it away from her again.</p><p>But she isn’t feeling that brave. Not today.</p><p>She rolls over onto her side, her fresh tears coating the pillow quickly, no amount of distractions will quiet the silent battle in her mind.</p><p>Rio can’t let that be the last time she sees Agatha, can’t let it be the last time she feels her touch. She rolls herself onto her back, clicking on Agatha’s contact name. Their previous conversation pops up reminding Rio of how much Agatha seems to care about her. She hovers over the keyboard willing her brain to think of something to write but before she can she gets an email notification headlined <b>URGENT</b> from Agatha’s work email. Rio’s fingers have never moved so fast to open a notification, but as soon as she clicks on it, she wishes she hadn’t.</p><p>
<i>Rio,</i>
</p><p>
<i>As discussed, I have passed on all relevant documents to Dr Kale who will now be taking over your sessions if you still wish to continue. I wish you all the best in your future and I hope things work out for you and Hela.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Best,<br/>
Dr Agatha Harkness</i>
</p><p>She couldn’t let that be all the time they had, she needs more time to show her that this is something worth reaching for.</p>

<p>Agatha would be lying if she said she hadn’t been thinking about Rio for the past two weeks, in fact Rio is all she’s thought about.</p><p>Rio certainly isn’t easy to forget nor did she make any effort to forget her. They were easier thoughts than being reminded of her past, all that pain with Wanda, the pregnancy, the losses she has endured. She has pushed all of that down, she can’t think about it, can’t feel it not again, not now, not ever.</p><p>Agatha had counted over fifty text messages from Rio within those fourteen days and not a single one made what Agatha was trying to do any easier. A normal person would have blocked her number to stop them coming but a small part of her loved it, they made her feel wanted. Someone wanted <i>her</i>.</p><p>They started off bearable, things that Agatha was almost able to handle.</p><p>
<i>
<b>Rio Vidal: Agatha I can’t see another therapist, it has to be you. Please can we talk?</b>
</i>
</p><p>No. No they couldn’t talk because Agatha was afraid talking would mean more than just that. Things would be said that should be left unsaid.</p><p>
<i>
<b>Rio Vidal: Agatha, please. Are you okay? Please just let me know you’re okay. I don’t care if you don’t want to talk to me. Fine. Just let me know that you’re okay.</b>
</i>
</p><p>No. She wasn’t. Far from it actually. She couldn’t want this, didn’t deserve to want something, <i>someone</i> so good.</p><p>
<i>
<b>Rio Vidal: I meant what I said you know. You do deserve good things, you really do and if you’d just talk to me I could make you see it, make you feel it.</b>
</i>
</p><p>And then they got harder to look at, more raw than Agatha could handle. She didn’t need Rio to do anything; she could already see it and feel it. Could feel it in places she stopped feeling things long ago, long dead and buried. But now she could feel those parts of her screaming, begging to let go, to allow herself this. No. She can’t. She doesn’t deserve it.</p><p>
<i>
<b>Rio Vidal: I’ll divorce Hela. I’ll do it. For you. To show you how much I need this. To prove how much you need it too.</b>
</i>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to believe, god she did but why would she deserve someone like Rio. Why would Rio stop trying to fix her marriage for someone like her. She didn’t deserve happiness, her job is to fix happiness for others not to create it for herself. She tried once before and it almost killed her, she can’t tear down the walls she spent so long building for something that isn’t hers for the taking.</p><p>
<i>
<b>Rio Vidal: Agatha? I’m worried about you, I came by and they said you aren’t seeing clients this week?</b>
</i>
</p><p>That was the last straw, she couldn’t risk running into Rio because she wouldn’t be able to control her reaction. She couldn’t continue watching Rio’s name flash up on her phone multiple times a day, it was too much for her. So eventually, thirteen days since she last saw Rio, she texted back.</p><p>
<i>
<b>I want you to stop pursuing me.</b>
</i>
</p><p>She is her own worst enemy, the maker of the pain she feels for not being capable of allowing herself to have more than enough.</p><p>The message flashed to read instantly and Agatha didn’t get a reply. She figured she didn’t deserve to be dignified with a response and tried to push the feelings down and continue with her week. She hadn’t seen any clients since that last session with Rio and this is her first day back on admin in the clinic, she would have been no use to anyone if she didn’t take a chance to breathe.</p><p>Agatha turns her head towards the dress bag hanging on the back of the door, trying to push away all Rio related thoughts that were consuming her. She sighs dropping her head dramatically against the desk trying to fight back the need to pick up, go home and drown out the thoughts with a big bottle of wine, but she can’t, of fucking course she can’t.</p><p>She has a fundraiser to go to, a fundraiser she absolutely did not want to go to but if it meant potentially securing more funding for her clinic then she had to go. And plus it would be a good distraction from everything right?</p><p>
<i>Wrong.</i>
</p><p>She pulls her phone out from the desk drawer, scrolling through her emails so she can double check the details for the fundraiser. Jen is picking her up in an hour so she doesn't have to face anyone alone. Eventually she finds the email, clicking on it and reading it slowly.</p><p>Agatha scans her eyes over the clinic name ‘Westview Wellness Center’, the name is so familiar she just couldn’t quite pin why. She continues to read,, double and triple checking she has followed the dress code and noted the address down in her notes. But there is something just throwing her off about the name, why is it ringing so many bells?</p><p>‘Who owns Westview Wellness Center’ she types into google hoping that this will put her mind to rest.</p><p>
<i>
<b>‘Hela Vidal owns Westview Wellness Center after stepping into management three years ago.’</b>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>Oh for fuck sake of course she does.</i>
</p><p>No luck then, Hela running an event means Rio is one hundred percent likely to be by her side tonight and Agatha isn’t sure she wants to see that. She reaches for her bottom desk drawer pulling out her emergency single measure vodka bottle, unscrewing the cap and cleaning it off quickly.</p><p>Agatha sighs, wincing as the vodka burns the back of her throat, deciding that alcohol will be the only way to make the evening and seeing Rio a little more bearable. Her eye twitches as the alcohol goes straight to her head, glancing towards the clock on the wall and realising that Jen will be outside the clinic to pick her up in fifteen minutes.</p><p>“Fuck my life,” she sighs, silently thanking herself for sorting her hair and makeup before she left the house. She rolls her head from side to side, stretching her neck out before pushing her chair back and moving towards the dress bag. She pulls the zip down slowly, taking in the navy pinstripe jumpsuit in front of her.</p><p>As Agatha gets changed silently wondering what Rio will think of her in this, it’ll be the first time they see each other out of casual clothes. Would the attraction still be there? Will the ‘want’ still be there? <i>Fuck no</i>. This is not what she’s meant to be thinking about, this night is not about Rio. This night is about her potentially gaining new sponsorships for the clinic.</p><p>Once she’s ready to go, she slips on her black kitten heels before touching up her red lipstick in her phone camera. She looks good, like <i>really good</i> and she’s managed to shake most of her negative thoughts to the back of her mind as she makes her way down to Jen.</p><p>—</p><p>The fundraiser is fine. Just fine. Agatha eats the food and talks to the people she needs to but she spends the majority of her time with Jen at the bar trying her best to avoid anyone else. By anyone else she means Rio but she won’t admit that to herself.</p><p>“What’s got you all worked up?” Jen questions as Agatha orders her third large glass of wine.</p><p>Agatha is grateful for Jen being here, but boy did she wish she wasn't away to be interrogated. “Hmm?” she replies, turning her head away from the bar to face Jen.</p><p>Jen laughs. “I’ve not seen you put drinks away like this since you found out Wanda was cheating on you, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, pissed that Jen is clocking her so early into the night. “Nothing! God forbid a woman wants to let loose for a night,” she replies overly sweetly. Jen stares at her realising the tone in her voice means not to press the issue any further for now.</p><p>Jen pushes herself up from the bar stool, explaining to Agatha that she’s going to go to the toilet before the speeches start. Once she’s gone, Agatha decides it would be more budget friendly just to order two bottles of wine and brings them back over to the table. The other people at her table just smile awkwardly as she sets the bottles down, unscrewing one and fills her glass to the brim straight away.</p><p>As she takes her first sip, that’s when she spots her.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Agatha places her glass down, leaning back in her chair as she locks eyes onto Rio and follows her across the room. Rio makes her way towards Hela immediately, pulling her in for a light kiss before turning round with a huge smile on her face to speak to the group of people she’s standing with, tucking her spare arm behind Hela’s back. The action sends a shiver down Agatha’s spine.</p><p>Had they managed to fix things? Is Rio truly going to stop pursuing her? Yes that’s what she’d asked Rio to do, but did she mean it? Not one word.</p><p>Rio looks so handsome, cream slacks paired with a white tank and matching cream shirt with black stripes through it. If Agatha squints hard enough, she can almost see the gold chain hanging from her neck.</p><p>She looks <i>so</i> fucking hot. Oh Fuck.</p><p>Agatha should be happy for Rio, she really should. Clearly things are beginning to work out for Rio and her wife, them attending a public event together and Rio looking so comfortable within herself is a significant achievement.</p><p>But Agatha is fucking miserable about it.</p><p>She returns her attention to her wine glass before she sees anything else that makes her want to pour vinegar in her eyeballs.</p><p>Time passes painfully slowly and she decides she’s just going to let Jen do the conversations for her for the rest of the night. She does however let her eyes occasionally find Rio, it terrifies her how easily she can spot Rio in a room of crowded people but she convinces herself that it’s because Rio is by far the most casual person at a black tie event ever.</p><p>Not some invisible string of fate that has coiled itself around them and keeps tugging her in whatever direction leads to Rio. Because that would be insane. <i>Totally insane.</i></p><p>Eventually the speeches begin, Agatha manages to clean off a full bottle of wine as some funding companies speak, some testimonies from married couples and Agatha can’t stop yawning at how utterly fucking boring it is. She’s pulled away from her boredom as soon as Hela starts to speak. She jolts up in her chair, clanging her rings off her wine glass which causes her to receive a stern side eye from Jen.</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen hisses.</p><p>“Whatttttttt,” she mumbles back.</p><p>“Shut the fuck up.”</p><p><i>Oops</i>.</p><p>“...and of course I can’t thank everyone here tonight but you should all know how grateful I am for everyone of you,” Hela speaks clearly, the speakers causing her voice to echo around the room.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, <i>what a fake fucking bitch</i> she thinks. She can still see Rio out of the corner of her eyes, leaning against the wall casually, listening to her wife closely with a small smile pulling at her lips.</p><p>“But my biggest thank you goes out to my gorgeous wife. She is my biggest supporter and I am so thankful to wake up in bed beside her everyday. She makes me a better person. Enjoy your night everyone!” Hela laughs down the mic before leaving the stage.</p><p>Agatha watches Rio raise her beer bottle towards her wife, winking as she does it. Agatha knows Hela is lying, she knew Rio had been sleeping in their spare room but is this confirmation that they had actually fixed things? Could they have fixed things so quickly?</p><p>Was everything Rio had said to her in those texts a lie?</p><p>It’s another subtle reminder that Rio can never be hers.</p><p>She watches as Hela walks back to Rio. Rio stands embracing her wife into a hug as Hela places a kiss against her cheek before whispering into Rio’s ear. She watches Rio smile as Hela talks before she walks away, gesturing to Rio’s outfit and winking.</p><p>That right there is Agatha’s final straw.</p><p>She turns to Jen whilst grabbing the other bottle of wine, telling her that she has a headache and is going to call a cab. She stumbles her way to the door and as she reaches the exit, she spins on her heels one last time to look around the room, not expecting to see Rio’s eyes on her.</p><p>They lock eyes and Agatha wonders if there’s a sense of guilt behind Rio’s eyes or is it pain? Rio raises her beer bottle towards her, an apologetic smile pulls at her lips. And Agatha wants to go over, wants to talk to Rio, wants to find out what’s been going on for the past two weeks. But she can’t bring herself to feel anymore pain, nodding her head lightly in response to Rio’s action and then continues on her way.</p><p>Maybe Wanda was right, maybe all she is capable of is making a mess of things.</p><p>—</p><p>It’s been two tortuous weeks of silence, well if you don’t include the one brief text from Agatha that just said ‘stop pursuing me’, which was worse than the silence. Declined calls, messages left on delivered like she couldn’t even bring herself to open them and one unsuccessful trip to her office to be told Agatha wasn’t seeing clients that week.</p><p>Rio knows it shouldn’t have happened, not like that, not in such a vulnerable moment where the lines were blurred.</p><p>But it’s been two weeks and she can’t stop thinking that even though it shouldn’t have happened, it did and maybe she shouldn’t have wanted it, should feel some guilt that she let herself try to take more but she doesn’t.</p><p>Rio hasn’t felt so sure of something in her life in the way she is sure she wants Agatha.</p><p>It has taken her so long to realise Hela only needs her to keep up the illusion of a successful marriage for her own personal gain. So long wondering if she has ever actually seen Rio as more than just a decoration on her arm, something she could dress up and flaunt when she needed her. Time wasted wondering when she will finally look at her and remember she’s so much more than that, can give so much more than that.</p><p>But not once has she opened her eyes and seen the damage that she has caused by just simply not seeing Rio as something worth holding close.</p><p>Seeing her as someone actually worth loving.</p><p>Agatha has told her she deserves more than that. Made her feel like she deserves good things and she’s almost starting to believe it.</p><p>Her brain has been playing tennis with Agatha and Hela’s words constantly, a mixture of ‘<i>I can’t see you anymore’</i> and <i>’We can’t do this’</i> to ‘<i>If I wanted to call someone handsome I would’ve married a man’</i> or ‘<i>You’re nothing without me</i>’. God it is absolutely fucking exhausting to be living in her head right now.</p><p>But she has to push it all away, but on a brave face and let it simmer.</p><p>She steps into their bedroom to find her wife leaning against their closet, a hanger swinging on her fingers.</p><p>“I need you to wear this tonight,” Hela says, attempting to hand it to Rio.</p><p>Rio lets her eyes flick down to the black silk dress in front of her and back up to her wife and grimaces when she realises she isn’t joking.</p><p>“No,” Rio scoffs, batting her hand away before sitting on the edge of the bed.</p><p>“Don’t start, this is a big night for me I need you to come, dress nice and fucking smile for a few hours. I don’t care if you need to fake it.”</p><p>Rio lets out a bitter laugh at how ridiculous it sounds. “I already told you I’ll go but I do remember telling you I won’t be wearing that.”</p><p>“I don’t care Rio, I’m asking you to do this for me, it’s really not that hard.”</p><p>“But it is for me. You aren’t listening or maybe you just don’t want to hear it. I can’t do something for you that isn’t comfortable for me Hela. When was the last time you saw me in a dress? When was the last time you really looked at me to be able to see that I am not that person you want me to be anymore?” Rio sighs, defeated, tired, over it.</p><p>“God your life is just <i>so</i> fucking hard isn’t it?” Hela mocks, chucking the dress towards Rio. “Just wear the fucking dress and stop making something out of nothing. I’ll meet you at the event.”</p><p>Rio flips her off as she strides out of the room and falls back onto the bed with a groan.</p><p>She balls up the dress and chucks it across the room, she absolutely will not be wearing it tonight and had her wife been kinder she might have taken out the new suit she got herself but why waste a good suit on an already sullen evening.</p><p>—</p><p>There may have been some pettiness in Rio’s decision to not show up to the event until it is in full swing. But mostly she wants to avoid as much acting as possible, the thought of pretending things were okay when they were the furthest thing from it is tearing her up inside.</p><p>She doesn’t want to keep pretending but one more night won't kill her.</p><p>She hopes.</p><p>Thankfully Hela is too busy with her head up some rich prick's ass and too careful with her actions to ever cause a scene in public. So when she sends a look of irritation when Rio greets her briefly, it only fuels Rio. She wraps an arm round Hela’s waist as she laughs at whatever current conversation is going on in front of her before taking some joy out of being able to just walk away and slump in the corner.</p><p>Had they been different people, under different circumstances, with better luck she could have been proud, even excited for her wife. But they are not and the cracks have gotten too wide and all that seeps out is bitter resentment from time wasted on a life that has never been anything more than a lie.</p><p>Rio swallows that down with a cold beer, then another.</p><p>She looks ridiculously out of place, the outfit choice is one out of stubbourness and she feels so fucking good in it. Every single side eye and raised eyebrow has brought her more joy in less than an hour than she has managed to feel all week.</p><p>Rio smiles when she is supposed to smile, laughs when she is supposed to laugh. Her jaw aches from clenching it too hard after one too many comments on how happy she must be with such a successful wife.</p><p>The speeches start and she leans against a wall, hoping if she wishes hard enough that the ground will swallow her whole.</p><p>Gripping onto the neck of her bottle as she listens to her wife thank her to all of these strangers but has never once done so in the quiet of their own home.</p><p>She feels eyes on her, the room spins as the anxiety bubbles in her gut and she is grateful for her body knowing what she should do as she smiles and raises her drink towards her wife. She’s also angry at herself for not yet doing what she actually wants to.</p><p>Hela makes her way across the room, striding straight towards her with a much too big smile on her face as her fingers curl against Rio’s bicep, nails digging in just a little too harshly.</p><p>Maybe she isn’t doing as good a job as she thought.</p><p>“You could try to smile like you mean it,” Hela hisses through gritted teeth as she leans in, her lips brushing against her cheek. “We will talk about this silly little stunt when we get home.”</p><p>Rio has to bite back the smirk as Hela gestures towards her outfit giving her a sly wink, lips twitching in annoyance as she walks away.</p><p>To anyone else it would have looked like an adoring wife coming to thank her for standing by her, for being here.</p><p>That’s what it should have been.</p><p>As she lets her head thump back against the wall her eyes catch the one person she has been desperately missing across the room. Rio lets her eyes drag down taking in how stunning she looks, the way the jumpsuit hugs her curves, she can feel the coil of want in her chest trying to pull her away from the wall, towards her.</p><p>As Agatha turns, their eyes meet and she has to plant her feet in place to stop herself from running.</p><p>She can’t. Not here. Not now.</p><p>All she can do is tip her drink and smile. Regret sinks in as she watches Agatha turn and leave.</p><p>Who is she to think she has some kind of right to more?</p><p>Yet Rio’s feet are moving and she slips through the crowd before she even realises. Even if she had no right to it, surely she has a right to be honest, to try.</p><p>As she rounds the same corner Agatha had, she is met with her stepping into a car and all she can do is watch as she slips away.</p><p>Maybe that is her sign. Maybe that’s how it would always be everything she wanted just out of reach.</p><p>—</p><p>The night ends as she expected, her wife dragging her for one final round of goodbyes to people she hopes to never have to interact with again. Hela drunk and impossible to manoeuvre away from the possibility of filling her pockets just that little bit more. Even drunk she can fool this whole room.</p><p>Rio watches wondering why it’s taken her so long to notice, it’s so painfully obvious. She laughs to herself, embarrassed.</p><p>Is she the only one that couldn’t see it?</p><p>When she finally manages to drag her wife home, Hela slips her hand around Rio’s waist as she stumbles against her, letting out a giggle as she sways.</p><p>She brings a hand up to rest on Rio’s chest before leaning in, her lips brushing lightly against hers.</p><p>Rio tenses at the touch, it didn’t feel real, didn’t feel natural, her thoughts still on watching Agatha round that corner playing on repeat.</p><p>She blinks down at Hela and her heart thumping in her chest as she thinks she’s not who she wants to be stood here with. She’s not-</p><p>Her thoughts are interrupted with another drunk infused giggle as Hela taps her chin.</p><p>“Come back to bed tonight, you do look really hands-“</p><p>Rio recoils, pulling herself away entirely, watching as Hela’s hands drop to her sides and she scrunches up her whole face at the rejection.</p><p>“No. If you have to get drunk to call me that then I don’t want it.”</p><p>She watches as the irritation sets in her wife’s face, the twitch of her lip as she snarls but Rio doesn’t give her a chance to respond, just slips by her and up the stairs.</p><p>—-</p><p>The water runs hot against her chest, hoping to feel something other than the heavy pressure against her chest. The weight of the decision she made as her feet hit those stairs threatens to crush her.</p><p>Rio thought it would be a relief, thought she would feel something shift inside her.</p><p>But that isn’t the only decision she has to make and the terrifying realisation that she has to decide if she is going to chase her happiness or walk away out of fear of the unknown is really what will keep her awake tonight.</p><p>Maybe she will feel brave enough to make that choice, not today but there is always tomorrow.</p>

<p>Rio’s thoughts start spiralling as she runs, she has spent so much time outside, trying to outrun her thoughts only for them to follow her right back home again. She hasn’t stopped thinking about Agatha. Hasn’t stopped thinking about her since their kiss fifteen days ago. The fundraiser made it even worse, locking eyes with her and watching her turn round that corner away from her, letting her slip away.</p><p>That’s not what Rio wanted, she has known that Agatha is something worth reaching for for weeks but she had to come to terms with what that will mean first.</p><p>It will mean taking a sledgehammer to the life she has spent almost three years building, this part she is ready for. Rio has already picked up the hammer, she just needs to take the first swing.</p><p>It will mean stepping into an unknown and learning how to potentially love someone new, if she’ll let her. And the hope that she will want to learn that about Rio too. After years of walking on egg shells, being careful with her actions and keeping up appearances just for a shred of bare minimum love back, the thought is terrifying.</p><p>It will mean learning to also love being alone even if she gets what she wants she still wants to love being in her own company without the need for someone else to fill the gaps she feels she is missing. Needs to teach herself that she doesn’t need everything to be perfect.</p><p>Rio has never really been alone. Before Hela she always had something or someone occupying her time but she doesn’t want that anymore. She wants to be able to wake up and love the person she has become, the person she has spent so long finding.</p><p>She wants to be able to give that person to someone who will love her and encourage her.</p><p>She wants to be able to give that same love right back.</p><p>Is it too much to ask?</p><p>Is she allowed to ask for that?</p><p>Agatha made the choice for them, she didn’t give Rio a chance to tell her any of this. Maybe Rio wouldn’t have been able to say it with such sureness fifteen days ago, but she is certain now.</p><p>She wants to be able to make her own choices, wants to have a voice and use, wants to be selfish and ask for more.</p><p>Will she be heard?</p><p>If the answer is no, will she be able to move past it?</p><p>Rio doesn’t know but she wants to take that chance. Doesn’t want to spend another sleepless night wondering. She wants to know she tried.</p><p>She should really fucking try.</p><p>The spiral continues as her feet slap against the concrete, her calves burning as she pushes herself faster, weaving in and out of crowds as she tries to keep outrunning the voices in her head telling her to stop letting people make decisions for her, to stop putting herself last. She’s too warm, the thoughts and the heat of the run make her feel like she’s going insane.</p><p>Rio honestly can’t quite pinpoint how and when she ended up standing at the front door to Agatha’s clinic. But there she stands, breathless as fuck in her sweaty gym gear, trying to decide if there is a single thought in her mind worth pursuing right now. Is this where she tries? She has clearly ended up here for a reason. Apparently her feet work quicker than her mind and she’s already halfway up that spiral staircase before she can think any better of it.</p><p>She pants as she stares at the metal name plate screwed into the door waiting for a beat to see if she can hear any voices from the inside. Once Rio is satisfied that she can’t hear anyone, she grips the door handle, swinging it open with force after she decides that she’s not got the time for waiting around and knocking.</p><p>She’s tired of wanting, so fucking tired of not reaching out and taking exactly what it is that she wants. She can’t let that herself stay in this cycle anymore, she deserves to ask for more, to want more. She pushes away any and all fear of rejection as she strides into the room. The night of the fundraiser was exactly what she needed to confirm the loud voices in her mind.</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha startles from her desk, glasses perched on the end of her nose, a hand reaching to tilt her laptop screen. “Yo-”</p><p>Rio rounds her desk, her chest still heaving from the run, sweat dripping down the sides of her neck, she had not thought this far ahead and it isn’t until she stops short in front of Agatha that she lets it fully sink in that it’s time for her to make this choice for herself, one that she doesn’t need to feel bad about, one that she knows won’t be bad for her.</p><p>Her fingers no longer tremble at her sides as they reach up and wrap around Agatha’s chin and tilt her head upwards, they are steady and so fucking certain as they bite gently into her skin as she leans down.</p><p>“I get to make my own choices,” Rio whispers softly as her lips brush against Agatha’s. “If I want you then <i>please</i> let me have you.”</p><p>The quiet whimper that Agatha lets out against her mouth as Rio finally kisses her hits her hard in the chest. She brings her other hand up and slides it around the back of Agatha’s neck for something else to hold onto. To stop her legs from giving out when Agatha finally kisses her back.</p><p>It’s gentle at first, soft, like they both are trying to work out how they fit together like this. Rio’s thumb brushing against her jaw, fighting back the urge to pull her out of the chair and against the closest wall as the softness threatens to slip away.</p><p>Rio lets her tongue press gently against her bottom lip, she is not above begging but she doesn’t need to as Agatha’s lips part letting her in, maybe a quiet admission that she wishes she had been bold enough to not let her fear make decisions for her. That she wishes she had been brave enough to not run when things got scary.</p><p>The kiss turns into full pure desperate need and when Agatha brings her own hand up to fist into the fabric of Rio’s sweat soaked tank and pulls her in closer Rio lets out a breathless sob against her lips.</p><p>The weight that’s been crushing Rio dissipates replaces with a burning her lungs as they scream for air but she’s not ready for this moment to end, not when she finally feels like she’s allowed to have this. That she <i>deserves</i> this. Her fingers tangle in Agatha’s hair pulling the softest moan from her throat before Rio finally pulls back.</p><p>God she wants to hear that sound over and over again.</p><p>They both let out the soft pants against the other's mouths, no one ready to let go just yet.</p><p>Rio lingers for a minute, can feel Agatha’s pulse beating rapidly against her fingers, she kisses her again against the corner of her mouth before stepping back letting the hand that is holding her in place drop back into Agatha’s lap before turning and walking back to the door.</p><p>“I know what I want Agatha, when you’re ready to admit that you want the same thing call me.”</p><p>The heat crawling up her spine isn’t the same as before she walked into that office and she welcomes it as she steps back out into the street and picks up her pace again, the briefest flicker of a smile creeping across her face.</p><p>Taking what you wanted felt so fucking good.</p><p>—</p><p>The door slams behind Rio, leaving Agatha completely breathless and honestly extremely turned on. The sureness of the way Rio’s lips pressed against her own, like she didn’t just make a choice, she owned it and wanted Agatha to feel it.</p><p>She absolutely felt it.</p><p>Which certainly wasn’t on her bingo card for the day. Her bingo card very much included nursing her terrible wine hangover and it did not include kissing the woman she’s not stopped thinking about for the past month.</p><p>Her head is swimming with it, the sure hands pulling her in, holding her in place. The hunger that seeped out of Rio as her tongue pressed against her own like she was savouring the feeling in case she never got to feel it again. God Agatha hopes she will feel it again but Rio made it clear that the choice is hers now, she has to make that choice. The same questions bounce around her in her mind, does she deserve it? Is she allowed to <i>want</i> Rio?</p><p>Is this something she is going to finally allow herself after years of hurt and years of assuming that she is undeserving?</p><p>Can she trust Rio?</p><p>She doesn’t know.</p><p>But the taste of Rio’s tongue in her mouth, the sweat infused scent she carried as she leant over Agatha sat in the back of her mind for the rest of the day. Twice she had to stop herself from bringing up Rio during another client’s session and that should have told Agatha everything she needed to know. But it didn’t.</p><p>Agatha arrives home that night and goes straight for the fridge, microwaving a ready meal before spending fifteen minutes choosing a bottle of sauvignon blanc for her evening alone in front of the TV. Because the cause is the cure, right?</p><p>Not even the wine is able to distract her from Rio.</p><p>In fact, it simply fuels her thoughts. With Rio she is being asked for something more, not being pushed away and left to be stuck in the torment of her own mind on her own.</p><p>She is so close to being pulled into something that might be dangerous yet it is so easy to see it as something welcoming and safe.</p><p>Is that what she deserves? Can she be the one to give Rio what she deserves? She needs time, time to sit with her feelings. Time to work on herself to figure out if she was capable of receiving the love she is more than capable of giving. The love Wanda constantly threw back in her face.</p><p>She just doesn’t know if she is ready to give it again yet, isn’t sure she is willing to allow herself to walk into something that could leave her worse off than she already is. Could Rio be the one to pull her through the other side?</p><p>There have been too many wasted years of wondering why she was not enough. Wanda stood back and watched as she picked apart the life they had shared, watched as it burned to the ground and looked at Agatha like it was her doing. Like she was the one that caused the choices that Wanda made by choosing to stay with her, for wanting to believe that there was more for them, for wanting there to be more.</p><p>The thought of wasting anymore time stuck in something so broken, something unfixable and torn to shreds is almost too much to bear.</p><p>She can’t make choices just out of want, she has to make them out of sureness that she won’t end up ruined.</p><p>Agatha needs to make her choice in her own way, in her own time.</p><p>However the certainty in the way those hands held her, the pure honesty in Rio’s eyes that she meant it, that she will give up everything she has built for a chance to know her? That is everything the Agatha from fifteen years ago had wanted, what she had dreamed of.</p><p>So why should she take that away from herself, why should she allow the past to haunt her and keep her from something that could be real.</p><p>She lets the wine settle, welcomes the warmth to her cheeks as she fills another glass.</p><p>Let’s it cloud out the negativity and thinks about the ‘what ifs’.</p><p>What if I didn’t go badly? Could it be something worth looking forward to?</p><p>What if she let Rio in? Showing her all the ugly parts of herself, the ones she keeps locked tight from fear of not being seen as someone worth loving. She deserves that doesn’t she? Someone who doesn’t tear her down to build her back up as a new version of herself.</p><p>Yes, she does deserve that.</p><p>So what if Rio is willing to give her that and she keeps running away out of fear?</p><p>She can’t keep running forever.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio’s evening has been painfully slow, she hasn’t relied on Agatha contacting her but she thought she would have heard something. An indicator that Agatha is thinking about her, thinking about <i>them</i>. An idea of whether they were even close to being on the same page, although the way Agatha’s body responded to her kiss told her <i>a lot</i>.</p><p>She hadn’t seen Hela since she walked away from her last night and couldn't bear to face her. They were living in the same space sure but as far as Rio was concerned they were living separate lives and had been for longer than she realised.</p><p>She kissed another woman. Twice. And yet concerningly has very little guilt.</p><p>But as far as Rio is concerned her marriage with Hela is over, she just has to work up the courage to end it officially, the lawyer already on speed dial for when she does.</p><p>She’s spent a lot of time in the shower over the past few weeks, taking time to sit with the thoughts in her mind and clear her head. Once she steps out she pulls her white tank over her head and grabs her boxers from the radiator. Rio shakes her hair from the towel, looking at the way it sits just above her shoulders and decides that she fucking hates it. It’s just that little bit too long.</p><p>She spent years being told to keep it longer, ‘it makes you look more feminine’, makes you beautiful. Rio didn’t care about any of that anymore, she wanted a change, another choice that she got to make for herself.</p><p>Before her brain catches up, her feet are pushing her towards the kitchen and her hands are grabbing the scissors before running back to the upstairs bathroom.</p><p>She stares at herself, pushing her shoulders back and grabbing a lock of hair in her hand. She exhales, nodding to herself as if to say ‘this is it.’</p><p>“Fuck it,” she mutters and makes the first snip. “Oh fuck.”</p><p>It is too late now to start making rational decisions so she keeps going, cutting her hair roughly so it sits just below her chin. It is a stupid heat of the moment, but fuck does she love it when she looks in the mirror.</p><p>She feels like she is seeing herself for the first time, a version she sometimes had only dreamt would exist one day. And now that version is staring back at her in the mirror. All she had to do now was find the confidence that went along with this version, the one she had spent so long hiding.</p><p>It looks good, great even, she isn’t going to worry about what it looks like from the back, that's none of her business.</p><p>Just as she finally gets round to brushing her teeth she hears her phone buzz on the windowsill. No one calls her out of work hours and she can’t imagine Hela is choosing to talk to her so she ignores it assuming it’s a spam call and continues brushing.</p><p>It buzzes again.</p><p>“Oh for fuck sake,” she mutters as she grabs her phone causing tooth paste to spit onto her tank in the process.</p><p>

</p><p>“Shit,” Rio mutters, pressing the answer button, putting the phone back on the ledge so she could rinse her mouth out. Her heart pounds harshly in her chest whilst the phone connects, attempting to prepare her for whatever is going to happen here.</p><p>“Oh fuck…” Rio says when the phone finally connects. “Hi.”</p><p>The line is quiet for a few seconds as Rio scrambles to pick up her phone.</p><p>She finally leans her phone against the cabinet, allowing herself to see Agatha. She’s met with a more undone version of Agatha than she normally sees. Barefaced, hair pulled back into a messy ponytail with a sheer white shirt. If she stares hard enough she can see that the first three buttons are undone.</p><p>She watches as Agatha’s eyes finally settle back on the screen, on her, her eyes widening before she leans in, jaw slack. Rio catches herself in the frame, toothpaste on her chin, on her tank, she has to stop herself from hanging up out of pure embarrassment.</p><p>“Oh fuck you- your hair?” Agatha lets out a long breath as she leans back, pulling a wine glass to her lips, finishing off the current glass. “Fuck when did you do that?”</p><p>“Uh literally about thirty seconds before you called, boredom I guess?” Rio laughs, she’s unable to pull her eyes away from the screen, from Agatha.</p><p>“It looks so fucking good on you.”</p><p>Rio can feel herself blushing, so she smiles shyly, it’s been so long since she got a compliment that felt real.</p><p>The line falls quiet, an unspoken silence between the pair of them. They both seem in no rush to break it.</p><p>“You kissed me,” Agatha eventually says, her voice quiet, almost like she can’t quite believe it.</p><p>Not entirely what Rio expected her to say.</p><p>“Mhm I did.”</p><p>“You have a wife Rio,” Agatha sighs.</p><p>Rio leans forward on the sink, watching the way Agatha chews on her bottom lip. She’s scared.</p><p>“I’ve been making a lot of choices this week.”</p><p>“And one of those choices was to kiss me?”</p><p>Rio hums, her lips twitching trying to fight back the smile at how serious Agatha looks.</p><p>“You kissed me first,” Rio raises an eyebrow as she pulls her phone up to her face. “I don’t think that was a mistake.”</p><p>Agatha frowns, lips pursing into a playful point. “I don’t make mistakes.”</p><p>“Oh, so it wasn’t a mistake sending me that email, the text?” Rio replies, smirking.</p><p>She watches as Agatha rolls her eyes and grins, she looks good like this, her cheeks tinged pink from the wine. Rio can’t stop herself from staring.</p><p>“Fine, I made one, okay two little mistakes and you still come bursting into my office and then leave, making me regret them with one ridiculously good kiss.”</p><p>Rio pokes her tongue into her cheek and tilts her head at the screen. “Ridiculously good huh?”</p><p>Agatha groans and runs her hands down her face before picking her phone up.</p><p>“I think I need another glass.”</p><p>“I’ll join you,” Rio says as she makes her way out of the bathroom. “But you don’t get out of answering my question.”</p><p>“Mm we shall see,” Agatha hums. “I’ll call you back.”</p><p>When the call disconnects, Rio takes a minute to mentally freak out about the fact Agatha called her, she made the choice to pick up her phone and call Rio because that’s what she wanted to do. Agatha wanted to spend her evening talking to her, <i>holy fucking shit</i> she could squeal she feels so giddy.</p><p>At the big old age of twenty-seven she should not be acting like some love sick teenager but she hasn’t felt this way in, well she hasn’t felt this way <i>ever.</i></p><p>She decides she’s going to allow herself this excitement, allow herself to swoon. She’s spent years hiding in Hela’s shadow and begging for scraps of attention. Well not anymore.</p><p>She makes her way back to the spare room, she feels like skipping with her beer bottle in hand, grabbing her airpods and connecting them. She gets under the covers, deciding her wet hair will just have to wait till she’s done speaking to Agatha. Just as she settles in, propping herself up against her headboard, her phone rings again.</p><p>She just stares at it. The name flashing in her face. It doesn’t feel real but she’s determined to not let herself get carried away, wants to let herself enjoy these moments. She clicks the answer button and the call connects instantly.</p><p>Agatha changed her camera angle, if she tilts the phone a little lower Rio would be able to see right down her shirt. She looks fucking incredible, Rio’s heart pounds in her chest as she tries to keep her cool.</p><p>“How was the rest of your day? Did you have work?” Agatha says, skipping all pleasantries and jumping straight into conversation.</p><p>“Nice try,” Rio teases. “You are meant to be answering my question?”</p><p>Agatha takes another sip of her wine and Rio copies her action with her beer. “What question?”</p><p>Rio laughs, this feels so nice, normal even. “Let me remember, <i>you</i> said my kiss was ‘ridiculously good’, didn’t you?” She air quotes with her fingers, watching the smile that takes over Agatha’s face as she talks.</p><p>“Did I? I don’t remember,” she replies, feigning shock.</p><p>“Rate me then,” Rio shoots back.</p><p>Agatha laughs in confusion. “Rate you? You want me to rate your kiss? What are you twelve?”</p><p>“Twenty seven actually, now do it. Outta ten please,” Rio says confidently, unsure she’s ever felt so comfortable talking to another person.</p><p>She watches as Agatha leans back onto the sofa, laughing to herself at Rio’s stupidity. “Fuck my life you’re so young,” she says rolling her eyes back.</p><p>“Fuck off I am not, now stop avoiding my question and rate my kiss,” Rio says pouting, jesus christ she really had lost the plot now she was even pouting for her.</p><p>“Fine. Eleven. Happy now?”</p><p>Rio smirks. “Very much so.”</p><p>They spend the next two hours like this, the call full of playful flirting between them. Rio’s pretty sure her face is permanently red the entire conversation. Rio tells Agatha that she didn’t want to be at the fundraiser, that she was putting on an act for the sake of causing herself less pain in the long run. Rio told her everything that had been on her mind, how she felt with Hela and how she finally wanted to take control of her own decisions for once and Agatha was incredibly understanding.</p><p>The time flies by and Rio almost doesn’t believe it when she realises how much has passed.</p><p>“...so yeah, that’s why I’m a sex therapist,” Agatha concludes as Rio is buckled over crying with laughter. “Come back to the sessions.”</p><p>It’s more of a statement than a question, like a silent demand. Through Rio’s laughter she isn’t quite sure she heard her properly. “Wait, what did you say?”</p><p>“Come back to the sessions? I’ve missed-” She stops herself mid sentence. “I think it would be good for you, I should’ve never tried to stop them, just when you were beginning to make some progress. I guess that was my second mistake. But if you don’t want it to be with me I totally get that too.”</p><p>Rio almost doesn’t believe what she’s hearing. “Agatha, <i>of course</i> I want it to be you. I’d run to you right now if you asked me.”</p><p>“Would you wear those ridiculously tiny running shorts?” Agatha smirks back at her.</p><p>Rio decides to push further, the beer was probably not the best idea. “Only if you promise they won't stay on for long.”</p><p>Agatha nearly chokes on her wine. “Tempting…” Agatha smirks and Rio can feel the tension between them, watching as Agatha seems to feel it too but there is plenty of time for that. “On that note, I’ll see you Tuesday?”</p><p>Rio pouts back at her but knows it’s no use.</p><p>“It’s a date. I gotta go smoke anyway, I didn’t realise we’d been speaking for two hours.”</p><p>“That’ll kill you, you know,” Agatha replies, raising an eyebrow over her glasses.</p><p>“Hopefully!” Rio laughs. “Bye Agatha.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Rio.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio honestly can’t remember the last time her week started so well. But this goes straight into the top five. She spent her entire weekend giggling over shared texts with Agatha. Things have been fun, chill and super fucking flirty. She’s not entirely convinced either of them mean it but she’s caught herself grinning far too many times when she sees Agatha’s name light up her phone. They decided that they would try and fall back into a normal rhythm with their sessions and that nothing had changed between the pair.</p><p>On Monday she had an incredible day on site, the team finally finished working on a surprise house upgrade for a family with a son in a wheelchair. The look on the entire family's face when they saw all the changes she’d made, god that is something she will truly never forget. Being twenty-seven and owning her own company is one thing but seeing the difference she makes to people’s lives? Indescribable. She reminds herself that this is all her own doing and that <i>no one</i> helped her get here but herself.</p><p>So maybe life is on the up for Rio, she and Hela have not had any contact since the fundraiser, both avoiding the inevitable that they know is coming. She’s been staying in a hotel for the past few nights but she has plans on how to deal with all that at some point but for now, she has her first session back with Agatha. It’s all she’s been thinking about to be honest, despite her insane workload at the moment, Agatha has always been at the back of her mind <i>and often at the front</i>.</p><p>Rio has not felt so ready for change before, yes it is terrifying but there is an excitement that fills her when she thinks about all that could go right for her over time. That is what she is focusing on. Finding new parts of life that she never allowed herself to fall in love with, new parts of herself that she never let see the light of day.</p><p>She has no idea what her sessions will look like; they'd made a deal in one of their many conversations over the weekend to focus on Rio and Rio alone. She quite frankly didn’t want to spend one more minute talking about her <i>wife</i>.</p><p>This is what Rio likes about talking to Agatha, conversation is easy and not forced, she gets to decide what she is willing to share. If one of them chooses to open up about something, the other one accepts that as a privilege and listens with care. Neither will push further than the other is willing to give.</p><p>Nothing is rushed, nothing is taken for granted, they’re just taking things as they come.</p><p>However somehow despite all the conversation over the weekend there is an incredibly awkward silence between the pair as Rio sits opposite Agatha back on that sofa where it all started. It’s like they aren’t quite sure how to fall back into the normal routine when things aren’t entirely normal between them.</p><p>Rio can’t take her eyes away from Agatha, the black and white striped shirt and leather trousers might kill her if she has to keep looking at her. But she can’t pull her eyes away. The way she saw the trousers clinging to her thighs as she welcomed her into the office paired with the red heels has Rio sweating like she is in a sauna. She looks fucking incredible.</p><p>She wishes she could see what Agatha is thinking about her at this moment.</p><p>Subconsciously she’d made more of an effort today, black tank with her smartest cargo pants and a denim jacket shirt she’d found in the back of her closet when she was grabbing more of her things to take to the hotel. Rio looks good, she <i>feels</i> good. Feels like herself.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat, eventually breaking the silence between them. “Still liking the hair?”</p><p>Finally, something Rio is ready to talk about. “Fuck yeah I do, it feels so, so-”</p><p>“Freeing?” Agatha responds, the corners of her mouth pulling up slightly as she watches Rio’s face light up with excitement.</p><p>“Exactly that. It was a weight I didn’t realise I’d been carrying around with me and hey I think I look pretty hot too,” she says, as she crosses her legs beneath her leaning back onto the sofa.</p><p>“Mhm.” Agatha hums quietly, looking down towards her notes, avoiding her gaze. “Why do you think it took you this long? Apart from Hela, was anything else standing in your way?”</p><p>“I think I was probably standing in my own way a little. Like I was almost afraid of what being my real self would be like. But it feels good like a massive ‘fuck you’,” she grins. “A massive fuck you to both Hela and my parents.”</p><p>“Your parents?” Agatha questions, peering over her glasses. She sets her notebook down on the table and leans back into her desk chair.</p><p>Rio folds her arms. “Yeah… Fuck them actually.”</p><p>“Tell me more?” Agatha asks, her tone sounding less ‘professional therapist’ and more filled with genuine curiosity.</p><p>Rio scrunches her nose in thought as she tries to work out how to describe it. She should feel lucky that she had parents who never abandoned her, who were around but she also always dreamt of having parents who accepted her for who she was, not ones that made her a version of herself she didn’t recognise in the mirror.</p><p>“God its so fucking tragic,” Rio scoffs. “They just didn’t care to be honest, like they were present in my life but not how a parent should be. They just didn’t want to see me as anyone but their ‘perfect little girl’ and that sucked. The pressure they put on the image of being this perfect family, the pressure it put on me to be someone I wasn’t. There was never any real family love going around, just what they wanted everyone to see on the outside. It was a lot. I guess that’s probably how my self confidence ended up down the toilet in the first place. They don’t talk to me much now and absolutely prefer their perfect daughter-in-law anyways.”</p><p>Rio’s at peace with the relationship she has with her parents now, she had long since gotten over that they would never change. They prefer Hela as she’s the perfect daughter-in-law who keeps herself all perfect unlike Rio who is a little rough around the edges. Rio realised all too late that her marriage was a recreation of her own family's life and she is grateful that she is working her way out before it is too late. Honestly Rio doesn’t mind sharing this with Agatha, in fact it’s nice to share it with her. To show her all the parts of herself as she listens intently.</p><p>“Possibly, do you think that’s part of the reason why it’s taken you so long to come to terms with your masculinity? Like you were never given a chance to be anything more than what they needed everyone else to see,” Agatha responds.</p><p>Rio sighs. “Yup, pretty sure they’re a significant factor in that, I was never allowed to explore any parts of that side of myself growing up but I’m getting there now and that’s all that matters. What about you? What was your childhood like?”</p><p>Rio flips the conversation to Agatha. She knows she’s pushing it with getting Agatha to open up within a session when they should be focusing on her, but after the conversations they’ve been sharing recently she figures it’s worth a shot.</p><p>She watches as Agatha seems to reason with herself, standing up from her desk and joining Rio on the sofa which seems to ease the remaining tension between them.</p><p>“If your childhood was tragic? Mine was a fucking disaster,” Agatha laughs. “Evanora was a homophobic cunt who wished she’d never had me. My father? Never knew him, don’t care to. Probably some unresolved feelings that I should probably be in therapy for but here we are!”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widen, not expecting Agatha to be so straight up with her. “Shit Agatha, that’s fucked I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Don’t be,” Agatha replies. “She’s dead and I’m almost free from the two people who caused me pain for the majority of my life. You win some, you lose some.”</p><p>“Fuck them all actually,” Rio nods giving Agatha a playful nudge with her shoulder, glad to see her slight twitch of lips in response.</p><p>She watches Agatha for a moment, the clench of her jaw as memories must be flashing behind her eyes. Agatha gives her a soft smile back. Maybe one day Rio will get to know more, but for now she will accept that she has been given what Agatha is comfortable with sharing.</p><p>Damn. Maybe they were both as fucked up as each other. They let the silence fall over them again, this time it’s not awkward at all. It’s comfortable.</p><p>Familiar.</p><p>“Well that got a bit deep didn’t it?” Rio awkwardly laughs. “We maybe should’ve started with our favourite colours?”</p><p>Agatha’s face lights up instantly, the sight makes Rio insides warm. It’s a sight she hopes she continues to make happen, one she doesn’t think she’ll ever tire of.</p><p>“Yeah, probably a little deep for a Tuesday morning,” she laughs. “Purple. Purple is my favourite colour. Like a deep purple but also like an azalea purple too, I love those.”</p><p>Rio sighs contently. “Favourite colour <i>and</i> favourite flowers too? Okay okay I’m taking notes.”</p><p>“You?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“Colour or flowers?”</p><p>“Both.”</p><p>Rio pauses, she guesses it’s time to let the plant nerd in her loose. “Green is probably my favourite, probably partially related to the fact most plants are green,” she shrugs. “I could never pick a favourite flower though or plant, I love so many for different reasons. One of my favourite parts of my job is finishing the houses off with a beautiful garden filled with plants and flowers, giving them somewhere to relax and beautiful things to look at. I think we all deserve something beautiful to look at, a reminder that things can take time to grow but when they do it’s worth the wait. God sorry I’m rambling again.”</p><p>“Don’t apologise, I like learning stuff about you. The ‘non sex related’ things,” she snorts.</p><p>Rio blushes, the way Agatha listens to her talk is enough to make Rio sob. She can’t remember the last time anyone cared about what she had to say, about who she is as a person. Sure it is just surface level conversation but it meant a lot more to Rio than it perhaps would to others. It's going to take time for her to stop apologising for talking too much about what she loves. Not used to not feeling like she is allowed to do it, not used to someone wanting to hear it.</p><p>They continue like this for the rest of the session, swapping favourite foods and restaurants, coffee orders and favourite films. It is the most at ease Rio’s felt in years. Rio took mental notes of everything Agatha is telling her, sure she may never need to know them for any reason but she is more than happy to learn.</p><p>Eventually the conversation that is full of laughter dies down into a comforting silence both aware that Agatha has other clients to see and that Rio has to go into the site office but neither of them clearly want their time to end.</p><p>Neither of them admitting that this was never supposed to be a session to begin with, just an excuse to be in the other's company without the pressure of it being anything more than that. Not quite ready to admit that it is more than that just yet.</p><p>“I’ll see you next week?” Rio asks, standing from the sofa, reaching a hand out for Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha takes it, soft hand clashing with rough as she stands beside Rio. Her heel catches on the rug when she stands, causing her to stumble closer to Rio.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flick to Agatha lips and she could lean in and kiss her, she <i> really</i> wants to. But she doesn’t, stepping back and allowing space between them.</p><p>“Next week, I’ll be here. Same time, same place,” Agatha nods, watching as Rio walks towards the door. “I’ll text you?”</p><p>Rio turns back to look at her, unable to control the smile that takes over. “Please do. Also I didn’t get the bill for the month, can you send it over again?”</p><p>Agatha smirks. “You didn’t see I’d returned your down payment?”</p><p>Rio blinks in confusion. “Agatha what? No, why did you do that?”</p><p>Agatha raises a hand, as if to silence Rio. “Don’t wanna hear it, we can discuss it later. Now go before you’re late,” she waves Rio towards the door. “Have a good day Rio.”</p><p>Rio sighs, knowing there’s no point in arguing with her. “Okay but we will be discussing this. Hope the rest of your day passes quickly!”</p><p>She swings the door open, letting it close lightly behind her. She smiles at Agatha's next client in the waiting room before making her way towards the staircase. The ‘session’ was almost perfect, she thinks on her way out. The way Agatha began to open up to her so casually made her heart warm, Rio can’t hide the smile that plasters her face for the rest of her day and she makes a mental note that she has to call that lawyer again.</p><p>—</p><p>A week later Rio stands at Agatha’s office door nervously, plant in hand. God what was she thinking, this is so stupid. She raises her hand to knock as Agatha simultaneously swings the door open.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio smiles shyly, handing the plant over to Agatha, <i>more like forcing it into her arms.</i></p><p>Agatha takes it into her hands, looking at it in confusion. “Rio I- What am I meant to do with this?”</p><p>Rio laughs. “Nothing, you don’t need to do anything with it. It’s a snake plant for the corner of your office and I can check in on her when I’m in for my session.”</p><p>She watches as Agatha mouths ‘her’ to herself and laughs under her breath as she turns to her desk. There is a fondness to the laugh but Rio bats that away as she makes her way across the room.</p><p>“I hate snakes,” Agatha says over her shoulder as she sets the plant down. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Noted. But isn’t she cute?” Rio pouts as she flops back onto the sofa.</p><p>Agatha hums before choosing to join Rio. “You look happy.”</p><p>Rio blinks back at her, not really expecting that to be what she was going to say and looking at Agatha it’s clear it was a slip of her tongue, like she had been caught looking a little too hard at something she shouldn’t. But she should, she absolutely should because her gaze on Rio is something she can never shake from her mind as the lights go out, the way her eyes linger just a beat too long, it's driving her wild.</p><p>“I feel happy,” Rio blushes, feeling ridiculous admitting it out loud to one of the reasons for it.</p><p>Rio is happy, the kind of happy that makes you feel full and warm and if this is the kind of happy she feels right now she can’t imagine how she will feel when she’s finally free from the last of what's holding her back.</p><p>“How has your week been?” Agatha asks, sensing that perhaps there is more to unpack and waiting for Rio to be the one to be ready to open that box.</p><p>“Ask me something more interesting,” Rio teases. “Or let me ask you something…”</p><p>Rio has spent her whole week entertaining small talk and she can’t think of anything worse than that right now. She had a very interesting dream last night and hasn’t been able to think of anything else. So she has questions or a particular question she wants to be bold and ask.</p><p>For science, of course.</p><p>Agatha raises her eyebrows and smirks. “You know it's not that easy.”</p><p>“It could be, but you’re no fun,” Rio pouts again, leaning closer to Agatha. “Please?”</p><p>“So polite, but no, my turn first,” Agatha grins at the frown her response gets. “Tell me something you have been working on for your own pleasure or confidence or just for fun.”</p><p>“Sexually?” Rio smirks.</p><p>Agatha smirks back at her. “So there is something?”</p><p>Okay maybe Rio absolutely put her foot in it, she should have asked for the question to be clearer before assuming, so she did not need to admit what her current search history looked like to the woman that is part of the reason for said search history.</p><p>Mortifying.</p><p>“I-,” Rio can feel her cheeks heating up. “I have been doing some research around ‘packing’ and uh the different ways people do that.”</p><p>“Is that something that you think will make you feel good?” Agatha asks, curious but as Rio looks up her own cheeks have started to warm.</p><p>“Yes?” Rio replies, not sounding very convincing. “I just don’t know if I would feel comfortable or be too worried about it being noticeable. There’s so many options, I am intrigued.”</p><p>Agatha nods. “You want to know what I think?”</p><p>Rio tilts her head waiting.</p><p>“Who fucking cares if its noticeable, let people see,” Agatha nudges Rio with her foot, getting a smile out of her. “And how will you know if you don’t try. It’s clearly something you are interested in and you’re right, there are many ways you can do it. Bonus? It’s also hot as fuck.”</p><p>The last part absolutely wasn’t meant to slip out, Rio watches Agatha’s eyes widen and she can’t help but let out a loud laugh at how ridiculous it is watching a usually very confident sex therapist blush at admitting something so freely to her ’client’.</p><p>“Noted,” Rio keeps laughing, but no longer has any doubts about giving it a go. “Now that leads nicely on to my question… What are you into? That last admission doesn’t count.”</p><p>If Rio had to share, surely she is allowed to push her luck a little, they have kissed twice after all.</p><p>Agatha comes down from her embarrassment quickly, enjoying this new found confidence that seeps out of Rio, she gives  a sly smirk before answering, “I love to read if I ever get a free minute.”</p><p>Rio groans, mostly at herself for not being specific, she really should have been specific. Yes she wants to know what Agatha does in her free moments, there’s so much time for that. Right now she wants to know what gets her off, what makes her desperate. She isn’t afraid to admit she’s thought about it just never been ready to ask. But today? Today it’s eating her alive and she wants to know everything.</p><p>“You know that’s not what I meant,” Rio leans towards her, letting her hand brush against Agatha’s that rests next to her. “I want to know what makes you feel <i>good.</i> Tell me? Please?”</p><p>Agatha lets her eyes settle on Rio’s, all she can do is watch as they darken slightly when Agatha leans in even closer.</p><p>“I thought you were a visual learner.”</p><p>The comment causes Rio to choke on her own saliva and no matter how much she tries, there are no words.</p><p>“That’s what you said, no? Thought I helped you out with that?” Agatha is clearly taking great joy in making Rio struggle the way she is right now.</p><p>“I- yeah, fuck well yeah I guess you did,” Rio eventually manages to splutter. “I thought we already established how ironic it was for me to not receive anything back, huh?”</p><p>“Hmmm,” Agatha ponders. “Okay, I love being the one in control but I’ll hand that control over if I trust the person I’m handing it to. We do have something in common, I <i>love</i> using people for my own pleasure, deciding what that pleasure looks like.”</p><p>Agatha shifts in her seat as she keeps talking. “I love it when a woman goes down on me, <i>that’s</i> what gets me going. There’s so much control to be had there. Does that do it for you?”</p><p>Rio blinks, her mouth going dry. All she can do is nod her head like a desperate puppy. Agatha runs a hand through her hair, both women clearly <i>feeling</i> things right now.</p><p>The room is buzzing with tension, Rio has to press her nails into the fabric of the sofa to ground herself.</p><p>“God it feels insane,” Agatha continues. “The feeling of coming undone because of someone’s mouth? Unmatched.”</p><p>Rio eventually finds her words, wanting to see how far she can push things, <i>push Agatha</i>. “I get it. Perhaps more from the other perspective however.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Yeah fuck actually now you’re making me think about having my face ridden, not being the one in control in that moment, being completely used. I think that would cure me actually. A pretty brunette riding my face,” Rio groans, throwing her head back against the sofa. That last part of her sentence was absolutely not meant to leave her lips.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat, chuckling lightly as she gets up from the sofa, letting Rio wallow in her pity for a minute, but she recovers quickly because she gets to want things now, she's allowed to be honest about that and these walls are the safest place to do that for them both.</p><p>If Agatha is anything to go by then Rio must look completely gone, she can feel like flush creeping up her neck. Can see Agatha’s settling on her chest.</p><p>Both of them getting too caught up in the moment of things they had both clearly been thinking about, too easy to let the truth come out under the guise of what they like and pretending it is not an admission of what they want from the other. Another ‘session’ full of ‘I want you’ but no one being brave enough to ask.</p><p>Rio eventually sits back up, taking this as her cue to leave. Agatha’s perching on the edge of her desk, sipping from a bottle of water. The action shouldn’t do anything to Rio but she’s so touch starved the sight of Agatha gulping the water has Rio squeezing her thighs.</p><p>She watches as the smallest drop slips out the corner of her mouth and drips down her chin. The thought of running her tongue up the same path flashes through her head and she feels dizzy.</p><p>It’s time for her to leave, she really should leave. But her feet have a mind of their own as she stands, instead of heading straight for the door they carry her until she stops short in front of Agatha. She swallows hard, her eyes still zoned into her lips.</p><p>Agatha’s own eyes flick down, her hands gripping onto the edge of the desk.</p><p>Rio lets out a slow breath. “I should g-“</p><p>Agatha clearly disagrees.</p><p>Rio gasps as a hand reaches out and curls into the fabric of her shirt before tugging her forward, pulling her in between her open legs. The room spins as Rio’s hands reach out to stop her from stumbling, landing flat on the tops of Agatha’s thighs. She can feel the heat radiating off her instantly. Her own heat curling up her spine as her eyes meet Agatha’s and can see nothing but pure desperation looking back at her.</p><p>She leans down, letting her hands roam up Agatha thighs and settles them on her waist pulling her flush against her. Their noses brush briefly before their mouths meet and Rio shamelessly lets a moan slip out that is swallowed as Agatha melts into her.</p><p>Agatha’s free hand comes up to tangle in Rio’s hair, taking full control of the kiss and she lets her. She lets her palm flatten against Rio’s stomach, fingers pressing into the muscles there, Rio's own nails bite into her sides. The room feels hot, almost overwhelming as teeth graze against her bottom lip.</p><p>It would be so easy for hands to move, for clothes to be peeled away, too easy to drop to her knees and have them both come undone.</p><p>Far too easy.</p><p>Rio can feel Agatha’s fingers twitch against the fabric of her shirt, itching to roam. The hand in her hair gripping tighter as their mouths move shamelessly in sync, soft moans floating out into the room.</p><p>They both want this.</p><p>But Rio knows there’s more that comes before that.</p><p>Her thoughts are validated as Agatha pulls back slightly, resting against Rio’s forehead, lips still brushing, not ready to pull away completely.</p><p>Rio nods, reassurance that it’s okay for Agatha to be honest, she wants her to be honest.</p><p>Agatha gives her a soft smile before she talks, her hands coming down to linger at Rio’s sides, still touching.</p><p>“Rio I- look, I love getting to know you. God I really do and this could be something more but I need to know this is as serious for you as it is for me.” Agatha whispers against Rio’s lips.</p><p>Rio moves herself back, taking Agatha’s hands in hers, looking her in the eyes. Brown ones meeting blue, both filled with so much desire. “It is Agatha, it really is.”</p><p>Agatha sighs. “Because I refuse to be the other woman Rio, regardless of how things are with your wife I can’t do it. I’ve been there, I’ve seen what it does to people and I just can’t do it.”</p><p>Rio squeezes Agatha’s hands, refusing to drop the eye contact. “Let me prove it to you, actions mean more than words right? I’ll prove it to you Agatha. I’m serious about this, about you. About getting to know you <i>properly</i>.”</p>

<p>“...and can you believe she claims we don’t have enough sex? If only she could hear what some of my clients tell me,” Jen laughs from across the table.</p><p>Jen had texted Agatha earlier that evening telling her that she has no more excuses to cancel their plans and that she would pick her up at seven. So that’s how Agatha finds herself four glasses of sauvignon blanc deep, almost crying with laughter at her friend across the table.</p><p>Agatha snorts. “So you’re telling me, your <i>wife</i> tried to book an appointment with her sex therapist wife just so you guys could fuck? Jesus fucking christ.”</p><p>“Insane right?” Jen laughs, smacking her hand on the table.</p><p>Agatha sips her wine, contemplating her words and waiting to see if the wine has gone to her head fast enough before she speaks. “Is it weird I’m jealous?”</p><p>
<i>Yeah so the wine has gone to her head.</i>
</p><p>Jen smirks in response, tilting her head towards Agatha and widening her eyes. “Maybe a little. Christ, when was the last time you got laid?”</p><p>Agatha feels her cheeks flush, Jen knows she hasn’t been with anyone since Wanda and god knows when the last time Wanda touched her was. “Fuck off. At this point? Years ago. Don’t get me wrong I’m a sucker for my vibrator but there’s only so much my own two hands can do, y’know?”</p><p>“Hear hear,” Jen laughs. “We’ve got to get you laid don’t we?”</p><p>“Yeah badly,” Agatha replies, pulling her fresh wine glass to her lips.</p><p>They sit in comfortable silence for a few minutes. Jen picks up her phone, smirking as she clearly responds to her wife. Agatha can’t help but feel the jealousy deep in her stomach, how she wishes she could have something like this. <i>How she wishes she could have it with Rio.</i></p><p>Eventually, Jen slams her phone face down on the table clearing her throat before tilting the neck of her beer bottle towards Agatha. “Mmm I meant to ask you, what happened with that client you tried to pass onto me? Did you take her back?”</p><p>
<i>Yeah, in more ways than one Jen.</i>
</p><p>Agatha almost chokes on her wine.</p><p>“Ohhhhhh,” Jen realises. “There’s more to this than ‘conflicting schedules’ isn’t there?”</p><p>“I-,” Agatha stutters. “Fuck well yeah I guess there is <i>a lot</i> more than that.”</p><p>“Well it’s an excellent job Alice isn’t coming to get us for another forty-five minutes. So talk. Tell me everything right now please and thank you.”</p><p>Agatha realises the only way she’s going to make it out the other side of this conversation is with more wine. She cleans off her glass, bracing both hands on the table as she inhales deeply deciding where on earth she is meant to start with this, <i>with Rio.</i></p><p>“Agatha come on,” Jen whines. “Just be straight with me, you can trust me.”</p><p>Agatha exhales. “We kissed.”</p><p>Jen pushes her head forward, eyes blown. “Oh fucking hell. You ‘Agatha stick-to-all-the-rules Harkness’ kissed a client? Holy shit,” she laughs.</p><p>“Multiple times.”</p><p>“And you’re still seeing her as a client? Agatha what the fuck? You could have your license revoked, you know that? You’re lucky it was just a kiss” Jen states, her tone full of sheer disbelief.</p><p>“Fuck I know, trust me I know,” Agatha sighs, dropping her head into her hands.</p><p>“But? I feel like there’s a but here?” Jen prods.</p><p>“I think it means more than ‘just a kiss’, to both of us.”</p><p>Jen raises an eyebrow prompting Agatha to continue.</p><p>“I think we both wish it was more than a kiss,” Agatha sighs. It feels good to tell someone about what she’s been keeping to herself, like a weight lifted off her shoulders but as much as Jen is her best friend she never knows how she’s going to react.</p><p>So Agatha spends the next twenty minutes filling Jen in on everything Rio. Well as much as she can without breaking patient confidentiality, her wife, the kiss, the fundraiser, the second and third kiss, their facetime calls everything. When Agatha speaks about Rio she notices herself feeling instantly lighter, can the heat flowing to her cheeks as she explains how much she cares for Rio and that her care runs far deeper than it does for any other client. Jen listens closely to everything Agatha is saying, sure sometimes her eye twitches with concern about Agatha’s rule breaking but honestly? Agatha isn’t really thinking about Jen right now.</p><p>“So yeah for the past, let’s say five weeks? I’ve been battling my own stupid thoughts and debating whether I deserve someone like her,” Agatha sighs.</p><p>Jen just blinks back at her before reaching out and tapping her phone. “Agatha what the fuck has gotten into you?” she laughs, pulling her beer bottle to her lips. “You just spoke about this woman non stop for twenty three minutes without taking a single sip of your wine, I- I’m actually lost for words. I didn’t think I’d ever reach the day where you spoke about someone like that.”</p><p>And it is probably around that exact moment that Agatha realises her feelings for Rio Vidal are not going away anytime soon.</p><p>“Yeah I’ve fucked up haven’t I? God she’s so young too Jen what am I doing?” Agatha regretfully asks.</p><p>“How old?” Jen replies face flooding with concern.</p><p>Agatha sighs. “Twenty seven.”</p><p>Jen laughs, bringing her hand to her forehead. “Jesus Christ Agatha, that's hardly young.”</p><p>“I guess but what if I’m ruining things for her, what if I’m too boring, what if-”</p><p>“Want to know what I really think?” Jen interrupts, sitting up in her seat and reaching a comforting hand across the table to Agatha.</p><p>“Unfortunately I do, you are one of the very few people I trust these days,” Agatha says, mentally bracing herself for impact.</p><p>Jen sips her beer again and appears to be mentally deciding how best to approach Agatha with this. “As your business partner? You are a fucking idiot, the chances of losing your license once her wife finds out? Extremely high. Also kissing a client? Is that not literally on page one of the handbook and I am so very sure it says absolutely do not do that. Correct me if I’m wrong but it’s a disaster waiting to happen.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes well, she knew it. Knew it was so fucking stupid to believe in something like this. She throws her head back dramatically, willing the tears to not run down her cheeks.</p><p>“Agatha let me finish for god sake,” Jen snaps, causing Agatha to force her head back up to face her.</p><p>“Fine. Continue.”</p><p>“But as your friend? God Agatha I’d be stupid to tell you not to go for it. I haven’t seen you speak about anyone that way <i>ever</i>, heck I don’t even think you spoke about Wanda this way. You really feel something for her don’t you?” Jen exhales, she clearly feels conflicted about the advice she’s giving, aware that Agatha’s breaking rules.</p><p>“Yeah I do, I really fucking do and it’s been eating me alive, I just-”</p><p>“Tell her,” Jen interrupts. “You have to tell her Agatha or you’ll never know. Agatha you deserve to try this. After everything Wanda did to you, you deserve to take a risk on happiness. We can deal with the other consequences later okay?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond, just raises a glass towards Jen before gulping it back.</p><p>She has to tell her.</p><p>She has to.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha stares at the snake plant on her desk, phone in hand as she lets out a dramatic sigh. She told herself it was just a plant that she’d put in the corner and hoped it didn’t die before Rio could come back to check on it.</p><p>But she can’t stop staring at it, every session she’s had since the damn plant has been in her eye line has been spent with her eyes naturally gravitating to it no matter where she is in the room.</p><p>She pulls up google and begrudgingly types in ‘how to care for a snake plant’. She will absolutely be deleting her search history after this.</p><p>Okay Rio wasn’t lying when she said it was low maintenance, surely she can’t fuck up watering it every 2-3 weeks and making sure it doesn’t get scorched by direct sunlight.</p><p>She keeps scrolling.</p><p>Repotting? God hopefully that’s not something she will ever have to do.</p><p>A flash of Rio knee deep in dirt, sweat plastering her brow and her arms flexing as she works comes to the front of her mind. Her breath involuntarily hitches at the thought, she shakes her head attempting to push these thoughts to the back of her mind. But it’s no use they just keep coming back and have been for weeks.</p><p>It’s shamefully one of the more tame thoughts she’s had.</p><p>She continues on her deep dive about snake plants, one website tells her they ‘<i>don’t require a lot of attention but they need basic care to stay happy and healthy.</i>’</p><p>Sounds reasonable.</p><p>Should she be asking for more than that, after years spent not getting even an inch of that, should she be able to settle for basic care and limited attention?</p><p>Is that how it should be, not asking for much and getting just the right amount you need to keep trudging by?</p><p>She supposes it’s better than being left in some dark corner to wither away.</p><p>After her conversation with Jen, she knows what she needs to do, can feel how Rio has carved her way into the centre of her chest and has started to burrow in and Agatha isn’t sure if she wants to know what it feels like without her there ever again. Not when she knows how good it feels to start to feel herself healing, how good it feels getting to move on.</p><p>Agatha does not want to be left to wither away alone in the dark.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>She puts her phone down and sinks back in her seat, thinking about the way Rio effortlessly opens up to her like it’s the easiest thing in the world. There is so much more to unpack about Rio Vidal but with everything Agatha knows now, she knows that she would spend years breaking down the walls Rio was forced to build to keep herself protected, she wants to scream at those that made her feel like she had to hide behind them in the first place.</p><p>But watching Rio’s journey of self discovery, of selfish decisions, of finding her feet in a world she was never ready to step foot into as a real version of herself after spending so long hiding. She wasn’t letting anyone take that away from her anymore. That has made Agatha realise that she can learn a thing or two from her, learn that she too can be selfish, find herself again and take back what was taken from her.</p><p>After the first session they had back, Agatha had felt herself slipping further into this unknown that was terrifying yet she felt like it was almost safe and real. Like she didn’t have to be afraid anymore of the ‘what if’s’.</p><p>Who cares about what might go wrong, if she didn’t try then she would never get to know that big ‘but what if it worked out’.</p><p>She smiles to herself thinking about the way Rio’s words have echoed in her head since that week.</p><p>
<i>“I think we all deserve something beautiful to look at, a reminder that things can take time to grow but when they do it’s worth the wait.”</i>
</p><p>How did this person, who had been through so much torment and pain look at the world like that? How did she still find time to look out and see that there is beauty in places that no one else even thought to look?</p><p>Could they grow into something good, something worth the wait after all those years of hurting?</p><p>Agatha had only been taught to see the ugliness in the things she loved, to look for the cracks and believe that she was the one who created them. That love didn’t get to be beautiful for her, that getting anything somewhat ‘good’ was all she could have. She had believed that it was all she would ever get and that she didn’t deserve anything more than that.</p><p>But now? Now she can see something that doesn't need to be ugly. Something that could be good and worth reaching for, she just had to be brave enough to take another step forward.</p><p>The room feels stuffy, full of all the things she wants to let free.</p><p>She has about fifteen minutes to try and get her thoughts somewhere safer, somewhere less raw. But should she really keep hiding it? Surely it’s time she is honest and spill her guts out on the floor and see if she’s left cleaning up a mess she created or if Rio will make good on her word and show her that this is it for her too.</p><p>Agatha could be in too deep, could have let herself get carried away, maybe she should have been more careful with the way she let those brown eyes peer into parts of her that she never let show. Maybe she should have walked away when she thought she could.</p><p>She couldn’t walk away now even if she tried.</p><p>Rio’s nails have sunk in deep and Agatha prays she never pulls them out.</p><p>The spiral of emotions continues as her feet pace back and forth her office. Thoughts of Rio’s lips melting into her own, her hands warm even through the fabric of her slacks, the way they so easily slotted onto parts of her that have been neglected by another's hands for so long. She can still feel the sharp rise and fall of Rio’s breathing against her palm that had pressed against her stomach if she thinks about it hard enough. The sound of pure desperation that slipped out of her throat when their mouths met.</p><p>Agatha is going to pass out if she keeps thinking about all it, she’s still too busy pacing to hear the click of the door as it swings open slowly, too busy thinking about how she is going to verbalise any of this without sounds completely insane to notice a gawking Rio standing in her door way, keys swinging around her finger.</p><p>It isn’t until the keys fall to the floor with a soft rattle and she hears a muttered ‘fuck me’ that she looks up and has a similar reaction but not quite as loud.</p><p>She watches as Rio shamelessly lets her eyes float down her figure, like seeing Agatha in a simple tight white ribbed dress and a blazer is the most insane thing to happen to her all day. It isn’t until Agatha follows Rio’s path down her own body that she remembers she had foregone a bra today and apparently her body is deciding to betray her by letting it be known that her thoughts had spiralled into something dangerous before Rio had walked in. The room is far too warm for her to even think about blaming it on the cold.</p><p>It also does not help that Rio has clearly come straight from working on site today, Agatha might actually need to sit down as she takes in Rio with a black cap sitting backwards against her tousled hair, black cargo shorts dusty with old paint and dirt brushing against her knees, a cropped white tank clinging to her chest. The summer heat has left a shine to every inch of skin visible. And a fucking tool belt? Agatha was practically already on her knees.</p><p>Someone has it out for her.</p><p>Rio clears her throat as she bends down and picks the keys off the floor. “Hi.”</p><p>If it was anyone else Agatha might want to cover her chest but right now with the way Rio keeps looking at her she can’t imagine ever wanting to hide any part of herself from that stare ever again.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha finally manages to breathe out, neither of them have moved from where they stand. She nods towards Rio’s hand, giving her a playful smile trying to bring the focus elsewhere. “Were you trying to show off as you came in?”</p><p>“I might have been,” Rio grins. “But it’s so easy to get distracted.”</p><p>Agatha hums, her eyes not leaving Rio’s as she steps further into the room, the door clicking shut behind her.</p><p>Rio swings the keys again. “I got my own place, no more complaints from house keeping about forgetting the ‘do not disturb’ sign. No more boring white sheets or lukewarm showers.”</p><p>Somewhere for her to grow, somewhere for her to settle, somewhere to fill with nothing but good. Agatha thinks to herself.</p><p>“The first draft of the divorce papers are being written up, my lawyer says he should have them ready by next week. I want her to know I’m serious, that she doesn’t get to win anymore. That I am making this choice for me and nothing that she can say will change that I am gone, even if she doesn’t sign them for months or years. It doesn’t matter, I am not something she gets to own anymore.” Rio lets out a breath as she steps into Agatha’s space. “I am choosing my own happiness and I want you to be part of that. I said I would show you with actions however I realise that those actions can’t just happen in a week or month, they will happen over time. It will be slow but it will also be worth it for me. I <i>really</i> want you to be part of this new life I am going to build for myself, in any capacity that you will allow.”</p><p>Agatha steps closer to Rio, she feels her heart thud in her chest. It’s been a long time since she had felt it pound so surely against her ribs. If Rio was any closer she’d probably be able to hear it too. Fuck what is she meant to say? She hadn’t prepared for this.</p><p>It’s what she had wanted to hear, what she needed to hear to know that her own feelings that have been building over these last nine weeks are real. Not just for her but for Rio as well.</p><p>
<i>Actions not words.</i>
</p><p>Agatha instantly closes the space between them, reaching out to grab Rio’s tank, taking the material in her fists and using it to pull Rio into her. Agatha takes full initiative and crashes their lips together, Rio’s gasp of surprise only fuels her further.</p><p>Rio’s hands land steady and certain on her waist as she melts into her touch. There is no battle for control as their mouths move slowly together, no one rushing, just the steadiness of Agatha’s mouth telling Rio that she will let her have her in whatever capacity it takes to feel her touch like this over and over.</p><p>Agatha's breath hitches as Rio’s hands start to make a slow journey up her sides until they are splayed flat against her ribs and she uses it as leverage to press Agatha backwards. She goes willingly, until her back hits flush against the wall. Rio lets her thumbs brush against the soft skin of Agatha’s chest through the thin fabric of her dress at the same time as her tongue brushes her bottom lip asking for entry and Agatha’s mouth does not hesitate in giving her it.</p><p>She reaches for the <i>stupidly attractive</i> backward cap on top of Rio’s head, pulling it off and throwing it towards the sofa. Agatha moans into Rio’s mouth as she’s finally able to run her hand through the messy hair of hers.</p><p>“Can I touch you?” Rio whispers against her lips, her hands coming back down to settle against her hips.</p><p>“<i>Please</i>,” Agatha sighs, the desperation in her tone is new, almost <i>too</i> desperate but the way Rio’s lips press back against hers has any hint of embarrassment evaporating instantly.</p><p>Agatha can feel the way her body has already responded to the gentle touch of Rio’s hands and they haven’t even touched her bare skin. Can feel the way her tongue brushing against the inside of her cheek sends a shiver down her spine.</p><p>So it’s not surprising that as soon as Rio’s lips press against her jaw and one hand wanders to brush at the hem of her dress that her body chases the touch, her back arching off the wall trying to keep Rio as close as possible.</p><p>The gasp that fills the silent room from the first stroke of Rio’s fingers on her skin makes Rio choke back a moan of her own as she makes a slow journey up Agatha’s thigh and pulls her dress up teasingly, her lips grazing against Agatha’s pulse point.</p><p>Agatha watches her intently as she pulls back, her fingers brushing against the seam of her underwear, her bottom lip pulled between her teeth as she lets her eyes settle on Agatha’s face.</p><p>The softness in her stare, her cheeks flushed and the small breaths she lets out slowly from her nose has Agatha wishing she could see her like this forever, like it's only for her, <i>because of her</i>.</p><p>Agatha is so caught up in memorising every freckle that is dotted against her face that the cup of Rio’s hand against her centre takes her by surprise and the moan that slips out of her throat can surely be heard from three streets over.</p><p>
<i>Thank god Jen isn’t in the office this week.</i>
</p><p>Rio lets her head drop until her forehead settles against Agatha’s. “<i>Fuck.</i>”</p><p>The hand she has gripping into Rio’s tank pulls tighter, a silent plea for more, knows Rio can feel the way she is threatening to soak through the lace, can see it in the way her breathing gets sharper. But Agatha can also feel the slight hesitation in the way Rio’s hand stills and her other presses more firmly into her side like she isn’t sure she gets to have this.</p><p>Agatha brings her free hand up to and lets her fingers press lightly into Rio’s jaw as she pulls her back.</p><p>“Hey handsome,” she whispers gently, letting her lips brush against hers before pulling back, waiting for Rio to look at her. “I want this. Show me how badly <i>you</i> want this too.”</p><p>That seems to be all Rio needed to hear because any hesitation she had been feeling is gone, replaced with a cocky smile and an eager thumb that runs cruelly down the length of Agatha. Just as she tries to chase the contact it is removed and Rio’s index finger is hooked into the fabric of her underwear and used to pull Agatha’s hips away from the wall.</p><p>The room instantly feels warmer, like any softness that had been spilled out is now replaced by pure desire and the weeks of want that had been simmering between them has finally reached its boiling point. Agatha can feel her chest rising and falling rapidly watching Rio’s eyes darken as she fully lets go of the last of the doubt she had been harbouring.</p><p>“You have no idea how badly I want this, how much I have thought about what you sound like, what you taste like,” Rio groans, her mouth inches away from Agatha’s but everytime she tries to chase her lips they are just an inch too far. “Can you hold your dress up for me sweetheart?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw slackens at the change in Rio’s tone, it wasn’t so much a question more of a command but with a sweetness that only she could manage and she can’t help it when all she can do is nod as her throat goes dry. The heat pools low in her stomach as Rio watches her pull the fabric until it's over her hips.</p><p>Rio smirks as she leans in till her lips are pressed to Agatha’s ear. “Good girl.”</p><p>It’s a test, Agatha can feel it in the way the finger still hooked in her underwear loosens and she can feel it pressing against her, just barely, but enough for her to want more. Her own body betrays her as a soft whimper escapes her and she grinds her hips down until she can feel the touch more firmly against her clit and keeps trying to chase the friction.</p><p>“You like to be praised?” Rio asks excitedly, like the way Agatha’s nails dig into her flesh and the way her hips can’t stay still isn't an answer enough.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warns, but it’s too breathy, too needy. “<i>Please.</i>”</p><p>Agatha lets out a moan as there is one last press against her clit at the same time Rio finally lets their lips meet. Just as Agatha’s hand reaches to grip onto Rio’s neck, in an attempt to take back some control, she pulls away again.  Agatha would be ashamed of the pathetic whine she lets out but she wants this, she hasn’t been so sure about anything like she’s sure about the way she wants Rio.</p><p>Before Agatha can protest further she watches as Rio sinks to her knees in front of her.</p><p>The room spins as those big brown eyes meet hers, the look of pure desperation as Rio slowly pulls the lace down her thighs and helps her step out of them. Not once do her eyes leave Agatha’s.</p><p>The room is filled with an intense quiet, like both of them are holding their breaths waiting for the other to say something but neither wants to break it. There’s so much said in that moment but no words are needed to be said for it to be heard.</p><p>When Rio finally lets her eyes roam down Agatha’s figure and all she can do is grip harder onto the fabric of her dress while she waits for Rio to make her next move.</p><p>It’s excruciating not knowing what she is thinking but she doesn’t get to overthink it for long as rough fingers run up the back of her calf and land behind her knee. Rio looks up with a playful smirk before gently pulling her leg up until it sits comfortably over her shoulder.</p><p>“You’re incredible,” she breathes out as her lips graze against the side of Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha mutters with a playful smirk, restraining her hand from reaching out and pulling Rio into her.</p><p>The chuckle Rio lets out vibrates against her thigh and Agatha bites back the moan that threatens to come out. But she can’t hold it back for long as Rio makes a painfully slow journey up the inside of her thigh, barely there touches with her mouth.</p><p>It’s too gentle, Agatha isn’t used to gentleness, isn’t used to feeling almost worshiped like this. But who is she to deny Rio this when she too hasn’t felt like she was allowed to take her time or allowed to enjoy it for her own pleasure as well.</p><p>So she lets her and she stops biting back the soft moans in her chest and lets Rio know exactly what effect just the simplest of touches has on her.</p><p>Agatha’s restraint falters as her fingers loosen their hold, reaching out to run through the short, already tousled hair in front of her and lets her nails scrape against Rio’s scalp as her mouth brushes against her centre.</p><p>She takes in a sharp breath, her grip tightening in Rio’s hair as she gives her one last look before running her tongue through her soaked folds and moaning against her. Agatha’s head snaps back against the wall at the same time her hips jut out. She gasps as Rio’s hands settle on the back of her thighs and she uses the hold to pull Agatha in closer.</p><p>The press of the warmth of her tongue and the nails biting into her flesh is overwhelming in the best possible way, the most embarrassing part is that Agatha is already close, the pressure building is anything but slow.</p><p>Rio doesn’t let up, she lets her tongue work perfectly against her clit before sealing her lips around it and sucking until she pulls noises out of Agatha that she never even knew she could make.</p><p>Agatha has been fighting against taking control but as she looks down and sees Rio looking up at her in quiet awe, her chin drenched and eyes sparkling, she stops fighting against it and she pulls her back in and grinds her hips down to keep taking more.</p><p>She doesn’t think she will ever get enough.</p><p>The muffled moans hitting against her with every grind of her hips only fuels her to keep going, but it isn’t long until she feels that pressure ready to snap, it’s completely out of her control as her hips still, her body going slack and she feels everything all at once as her orgasm rips through her.</p><p>“Holy fuck,” Agatha groans as it just keeps coming. “FUCK!”</p><p>Rio’s mouth keeps working her through it, slow and delicate. Agatha has to pull her head away as her body threatens to snap again and she is not up for explaining how she ruined her office carpet when the cleaner’s come in.</p><p>When she eventually manages to pull her head away from the wall, she finds that similar look of awe staring back at her as Rio runs her tongue across her lips and sets her face into a grin before placing a soft kiss to the inside of Agatha’s thigh and a final one against her clit that gets another gasp hitting the air.</p><p>“You’re awful,” Agatha groans, letting her hand tuck under Rio’s chins and pulls her up from her knees but the smile she feels tugging at her lips gives away how she really feels.</p><p>Rio hums, letting herself lean in until her chest is flush with Agatha’s. “The worst.”</p><p>Agatha wants to slap the silly smug look she has but again her body betrays her as her hands find their way to Rio’s cheeks and she pulls her in and kisses her. The taste of herself on Rio’s lips, the heat of her cheeks against her palms and the smile she can feel between each pass of their lips has her already desperate for Rio’s touch again.</p><p>She realises how dangerous that is but for the first time she feels no need to run from it.</p><p>Rio pulls back letting her nose brush against Agatha’s before smiling wide. “So I take it this means you want to be a part of it?”</p><p>“You’re ridiculous,” Agatha can’t help but grin back, letting her eyes flutter closed letting it fully sink in. “Yes I want to be a part of it.”</p><p>Agatha shivers as her dress is worked back over her hips, her skin too sensitive yet she’s not ready to feel any space between them.</p><p>Rio must sense it as she brings hand up to settle against her cheek and presses her lips to the corner of her mouth before pulling Agatha in close and letting her settle against her shoulder. Her own hands settle against Rio’s chest and she can feel the way her heart pounds perfectly, matching her own.</p><p>She smiles, a genuine and warm smile at the thought that there is so much more of this to come and that she doesn’t need to be afraid to let go because she believes Rio isn’t actually going to go anywhere.</p><p>As she pulls back, legs still weak beneath her she can’t help but let out a soft laugh at the dazed look that Rio hasn’t been able to shake since she walked into the room.</p><p>“Are you sure you can walk out of here without looking like you’re three seconds away from coming in your pants?”</p><p>Rio gawks back at her, playfully knocking her against the shoulder before clearing her throat. “Y-yes.”</p><p>“Mm if you say so handsome,” Agatha smirks, pushing Rio back and straightening her dress.</p><p>Before she can make any further movements she is pulled back in for another brief kiss before Rio grins and starts walking back towards the door.</p><p>“We aren’t done here,” She calls out with a wink, her hand reaching for the handle. “Your next client needs you.”</p><p>Agatha is left standing in the middle of her office, thighs sticky, underwear draped over the arm of the sofa and a warmth settling deep in her chest.</p><p>They are definitely not done here.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio is stressed.</p><p>Not in a bad way but in a sort of ‘never in her life had she been in this situation before’ type of way.</p><p>With everything that happened between her and Agatha over the past few weeks she had completely forgotten about her ‘homework’. She has no idea where things were officially going between them but they are certainly going somewhere so she figured no time like the present.</p><p>After spending last night going down a reddit rabbit hole of advice she is feeling pretty confident on her twenty minute walk here, it is only when she sees the neon sign outside that she can feel her palms getting sweaty. But she sure as hell didn’t walk all this way to give up.</p><p>Rio stuffs her hands into her jean pockets whilst quickly running through her list in her head one last time. She notices the door open automatically for someone else and makes sure to tilt her head down as she crosses the road. <i>She wore a baseball cap for a reason.</i></p><p>She steps in, exhaling slowly and lifting her head.</p><p>“Jesus fuck,” she mutters.</p><p>Right in front of her are two metal poles with a big black box in the middle, it takes her eyes just seconds to adjust when she realises exactly what she’s looking at</p><p>A fucking sex machine. It is moving. Fast. A demonstration of the machine’s functions just in the middle of the room. Christ she might as well be getting fucked in the face by a bright pink dildo right now.</p><p>Excellent start.</p><p>Rio accidentally catches an employee’s eye and is quickly reminded that she is not here to gawk and has a list of things she’s meant to be picking up. She almost sprints up to the wall at the back which has a variety of dildos spread across it.</p><p>Oh they are colour coordinated. Nice.</p><p>
<i>A Rainbow of dildos.</i>
</p><p>Whilst she tries to mentally recover from the fucking-machine-at-the-front-door scare, she scans the dildos trying to decide where to start.</p><p>Realistically and also embarrassingly, Rio is incredibly out of her depth here. The only sex toys she’d owned with Hela were a bullet vibrator that only worked on the best of days and a strap that was only good for collecting dust in her bottom drawer. But she assumed she’d done enough research to prepare herself for this moment.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Eventually she spots something that catches her eyes, it’s purple and looks like a decent size. <i>What the hell sure,</i> she thinks as she reaches out to grab it.</p><p>She’s trying to rack her brain whilst she reads over the specifications when she’s interrupted by a voice.</p><p>“Need any help with that?” a small blonde asks beside her. Rio practically jumps out of her skin, dropping the dildo on the floor.</p><p>“Uh- no thank you,” she stutters. “I’m good thank you though, all fine here I know what I’m doing!”</p><p>She reaches down to grab the box and unbeknownst to her, her rucksack is dragging several other boxes off the shelf behind her as she reaches down. Rio hears the blonde giggle beside her as she stands back up realising the chaos she’s created.</p><p>“Ohmygod,” she chants repeatedly, hurrying to pick up the other boxes and stuff them back onto the shelf. “Fuck fuck fuck.”</p><p>The blonde just stares as Rio frantically races round the shop trying to grab the rest of the things on her list. What she hasn’t realised is that she is the only customer now in the store and has five sets of staff members eyes on her.</p><p>Eventually, a breathless Rio dumps a basket of things on the cash desk with no real idea of what exactly it is that she’s picked up. She avoids eye contact as the cashier begins to take the items out of the basket.</p><p>“Big night ahead?” the man asks.</p><p>Rio laughs awkwardly. “Y-yeah something like that.”</p><p>She watches in terror as the man removes a box of ‘ropes for beginners’ from her basket and scans them. When the fuck had she picked that up? He keeps making sporadic eye contact as she continues to watch everything scan through and mentally ticks off her list as she goes. Thankfully, despite the trauma, she has managed to gather everything as intended <i>with a few accidental extras.</i></p><p>“$495 please,” the cashier eventually says.</p><p>Rio gawks at the register. “Are- are you sure?”</p><p>“Positive, you’ve grabbed some of the higher end items.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio replies, reaching her phone out to the card machine to pay, far too awkward to try and put anything back.</p><p>Once that horror is over, she now faces the next one of stuffing everything into her tiny backpack and manifesting that she can get the zip closed without breaking it.</p><p>Finally she steps outside, as she’s beginning to get over the extreme feeling of lightheadedness, she realises that she should have done all that online and will absolutely never be setting foot in a sex shop ever again.</p><p>—</p><p>The following Tuesday, Rio is elbow deep into unpacking her moving boxes listening to some nineties mix she had stumbled across on her Alexa. The whole experience is quite depressing when she realises how little of her things truly felt like hers, however getting this fresh start means she can now slowly build a home that is filled with everything that is just for her.</p><p>She’s in the middle of screwing the new shower screen in place when her phone pings. It’s specifically the tone she set for Agatha and she can’t help the smile that tugs at her lips when she hears it. Rio’s hands move faster, tightening the screws so she can pick her phone up.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:01pm:</b><br/>
I’ve missed seeing you today :(</p><p>Agatha is out of town for a conference for two days and has cancelled all her clients' sessions, including Rio’s. Luckily Rio has been pretty distracted with unpacking and building things in her new home that she hadn’t quite noticed the loss of the session but she definitely misses Agatha. That is a funny pill to swallow, missing someone. She hasn’t done that in a long time.</p><p><b>Me 8:11pm:</b><br/>
I’ve missed it more.<br/>
How's it going over there?</p><p>Rio sends the text and places her phone back down on the counter not expecting Agatha’s response to come so fast.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:12pm:</b><br/>
Fucking boring, the people here are a bunch of pretentious assholes.<br/>
Dinner’s finally over and I’m back in my hotel room now.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:12pm:</b><br/>
How’s your day going?</p><p>Rio could tell Agatha it’s equally as boring or she could tell Agatha what she’d been up to that morning, leaving out the incredible humility of it all.</p><p><b>Me 8:13pm: </b><br/>
Hmmm it’s good actually, mostly unpacking at my new place, it’s shaping up pretty nicely.</p><p><b>Me 8:13pm: </b><br/>
Oh I did go shopping this morning.</p><p>Again Agatha’s reply pings through straight away which has Rio deciding that the rest of the bathroom can wait till later and makes her way up to her bedroom, nearly tripping on the stairs as she grins at her phone.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:13pm:</b><br/>
Oh? Get anything interesting?</p><p>Interesting is certainly one word for it. But she is feeling braver than normal, Rio fires back a text that has her wanting to throw her phone against the wall.</p><p><b>Me 8:15pm: </b><br/>
You know what, yeah I did.</p><p><b>Me 8:15pm:</b><br/>
I could show you if you want, might cheer you up a little? ;)</p><p>Rio stares at her rucksack in the corner of her room that she’d abandoned earlier. She wasn’t planning on getting it all out so soon but she figures whilst she has Agatha’s attention, the first time could be a lot more fun.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:16pm:</b><br/>
Do you even need to ask?</p><p>Rio smirks, wishing she could see Agatha’s face, wondering what she is anticipating. She pulls the dark green box out of her rucksack, opening it hurriedly and holding the silicone in her hands. It isn’t big but it definitely isn’t small either. She inhales deeply, it is another one of those moments that she had only ever thought about coming to life, one she thought she would never find the confidence to try out.</p><p>She skims over the instructions before pulling out the boxers that came in the box, they aren’t anything special, just black with a dark grey waistband and a small pocket on the inside it has an o ring, the strap that comes with the set is 5 inches, soft enough to pack but still firm enough for play. She places them on the end of her bed before rushing to the drawers she built earlier and pulling out a pair of tight cargo pants.</p><p>Rio stares at the bed. This is it. No more running from the person she wants to be, the person she never thought she’d become. Just another nail in the coffin of the person she used to be. She <i>is</i> that person now and she loves it.</p><p>She pushes her gym shorts and current boxers off, picking them up and throwing them into the laundry basket before picking up the new ones. They’re tight against her, just how she had hoped and she wastes no time sliding the silicone into the pocket.</p><p>Rio looks down. “Oh shitttttt,” she smirks, instantly feeling a sense of confidence run through her. She grabs the cargos, pulling them over her legs quickly so she can get back to Agatha. But she moves too quickly and ends up getting one of legs tangled in the pants and almost ends up flat on the floor.</p><p>Eventually she’s good to go.</p><p>Suddenly she’s very grateful she hadn’t had the chance to drill her big mirror onto the wall as it currently sits against it at perfect selfie height. She looks at herself in the mirror, smirking again, the slightest bulge showing through her cargos. Quickly, she scoops her phone up from where she left it and to no surprise there’s a string of texts from Agatha.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:18pm:</b><br/>
I don’t like to be kept waiting, Rio.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:20pm:</b><br/>
Where did you go?</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:22pm: </b><br/>
Rio what are you doing??</p><p>Rio smiles, it’s nice to feel like someone’s waiting for you, having someone showing interest. She spends no more time keeping her waiting and snaps a picture. Arm holding the top of the mirror whilst her nipple piercings poke through her white tank.</p><p>She sends it captionless and keeps looking at herself in the mirror, trying out different angles to see what positioning she likes best.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist: 8:30pm:</b><br/>
You look smart.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:30pm:</b><br/>
Fuck I forgot about those piercings, you trying to kill me?</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist: 8:31pm:</b><br/>
New cargos?</p><p>Huh shit… Maybe it isn’t as obvious as Rio thought. So she tries again, this time standing closer to the mirror, looping two of her fingers through the loop on her cargos. She decides her face can be seen this time, just the lower half though and she pulls her bottom lip between her teeth, sending the picture with a caption this time.</p><p><b>Me 8:34pm:</b><br/>
Old cargos but something else is new.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:35pm:</b><br/>
Fuck oh my god is that???</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:35pm: </b><br/>
Christ Rio could have gave some kind of warning, you look <i>so</i> fucking good!!</p><p>Success.</p><p><b>Me 8:36pm:</b><br/>
Mhm it is, got it this morning. I thought it was about time I did my homework for you.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:36pm:</b><br/>
Good boy, I like it.<br/>
What else did you get?</p><p><b>Me 8:37pm:</b><br/>
Now now, that’s for me to know and <i>you</i> to find out.</p><p>Rio has a permanent smirk on her face as she stands in front of the mirror almost hoping that Agatha will instruct her to do something.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:38pm:</b><br/>
I did some of my own shopping too on my break actually, want to see?</p><p>Fuck. Yes Rio wants to see, so so fucking badly. She didn’t care what Agatha had bought; she just hopes it means getting to see her.</p><p><b>Me 8:39pm:</b><br/>
More than anything.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:40pm:</b><br/>
Okay, give me two minutes.</p><p>Rio walks over to her bed, perching herself on the end of it whilst she waits. Her knee shakes up and down in nervous anticipation. The minutes pass slowly and there’s nothing from Agatha, almost to the point where Rio worries she’s fallen asleep.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:50pm:</b><br/>
Sorry… but it’s worth the wait.</p><p>With a picture attached. Rio waits for it to load, clicking it so that it covers her phone full screen. As soon as it loads her phone falls straight to the floor. Rio assumed Agatha was winding her up and was going to send a picture of a book or something stupid but nothing, <i>nothing</i> could have prepared her for <i>that</i>.</p><p>Definitely worth the wait.</p><p>Rio’s stares at her face, natural makeup and that fucking red lipstick again. Her eyes wander lower, a thin halterneck strap sits over her collarbones that shine in the bathroom mirror. Rio wants to run her tongue along them. She doesn’t want to take her eyes off them but slowly lets them trail lower as she takes in the black silk dress that hugs Agatha’s curves perfectly causing Rio’s heart to thud in her chest, heat starting to rise up the back of her neck. She stares at her fingers, curved round a wine glass and imagines them curved round her throat.</p><p>For once she doesn’t feel the need to try and shake off the thought.</p><p>She’s incredibly grateful she’s currently sat down.</p><p>She can’t take her eyes off of her, can’t move her fingers to type out a response. Agatha looks fucking beautiful, perfect even. How someone could ever mistreat this woman Rio would never be sure.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 8:58pm:</b><br/>
Well? Like what you see?</p><p><b>Me 8:58pm: </b><br/>
Agatha, holy shit you are fucking beautiful.</p><p><b>Me 8:59pm: </b><br/>
Like. Holy fucking shit.</p><p><b>Me 8:59pm:</b><br/>
For any occasion in particular?</p><p>Rio pushes her cargos down, all of a sudden very aware of how stuffy and warm it feels in her bedroom. She smiles as she feels the bulge when she takes her cargos off, the feeling that rushes through her body is unmatched.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 9:00pm:</b><br/>
For when you stop fucking around and take me to dinner.</p><p>Momentarily, Rio is reminded how serious this is for Agatha too and makes a mental note that as soon as her divorce papers are signed she’s taking Agatha out.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 9:01pm: </b><br/>
Enough about me, I wanna see you.</p><p><i>Fuck my life</i> Rio cringes, realising that she should’ve left her cargos on if she is going to be taking more photos. She really cannot be bothered to put them back on now but as she moves to grab them, her phone buzzes.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 9:02pm:</b><br/>
Maybe without the cargos…?</p><p>Oh.</p><p><i>Oh.</i> Agatha wants to see her. She supposes it is only fair and you know what, she wants Agatha to see her. To <i>properly</i> see her. She’s never really done <i>this</i>, any time she tried to send Hela a picture of her working out at the gym or anything remotely suggestive she was ignored or told ‘stop that.’ So this is another new opportunity for Rio to be shown how things should be, how she deserves to be looked at.</p><p>This new found confidence is something Rio is still getting used to so when she stands in front of the mirror she actually has no idea how to take a picture without clothes on. She uses one hand to push her tank further up her body, allowing her abs to be seen because why the hell not. The material covers one of her tits and the other is covered by her hand as she covers her face with her phone and pulls her lip back between her lips as that seemed to help last time. She snaps a handful of pictures, changing the way she stands awkwardly each time.</p><p>After about ten minutes of posing in the mirror she lies back flat on her bed and scrolls through the pictures choosing three of the ones she deems best and sending them over to Agatha.</p><p><b>Me 9:15pm:</b><br/>
Something like this?</p><p>Rio’s heart pounds in her chest as the delivered notification turns to read. So pushes back all the trained thoughts about how Hela had conditioned her to treat herself and waits for Agatha’s response.</p><p>Whilst she waits she plays about, taking pictures as she lies down, she’s never been more grateful for her abs than right now. She can’t believe how good she both looks and feels, that small bulge in her boxers doing her the world of good. She takes pictures that almost make her look like a fucking horny teenager when she sends them across to Agatha and she doesn’t care. She’s never had the chance to feel this way before.</p><p>Still no response from Agatha. Had she been too much?</p><p>Agatha responds, it’s a fucking gif of a woman passing out against a door. Rio can’t help but chuckle at Agatha’s response as she scrolls down to read the string of texts that follow it.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 9:28pm:</b><br/>
THAT’S what you’ve been holding out on me?</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 9:28pm:</b><br/>
So fucking handsome, I feel fucking weak.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 9:29pm: </b><br/>
Oh you’re going to be the fucking death of me.</p><p>It is funny she says that because Rio is pretty sure Agatha Harkness was going to be the death of her.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 9:30pm:</b><br/>
God, fuck I wish you were here.</p><p>Rio wishes it too, wishes she was the one undressing her out of that silk dress. What she would give to be on her knees for Agatha right now.</p><p><b>Me 9:30pm: </b><br/>
Approved then?</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 9:31pm:</b><br/>
Approved and you fucking know it.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 9:31pm: </b><br/>
If you were here right now, I’d make you watch whilst I grind on it. You wouldn’t be able to last five minutes without coming in your pants. Maybe that’s how we fix that actually?</p><p>Fuck oh my god. Rio hadn’t realised that the hand not holding her phone had gravitated towards her crotch, palming the silicone lightly over her shorts. It wasn’t until it hit her clit perfectly that she realised what she’d been doing.</p><p><b>Me 9:32pm:</b><br/>
Grind on what exactly?</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 9:35pm:</b><br/>
On whatever I wanted and you’d only be allowed to watch. No touching.</p><p>Rio’s hand moves faster, her hips bucking against thin air. She needs Agatha and she needs her now. The whine that escapes her mouth is fucking pathetic and if she starts moaning Agatha’s name under her breath who can blame her.</p><p><b>Me 9:38pm:</b><br/>
Fuck. Agatha I need to see you.</p><p><b>Me 9:38pm: </b><br/>
When?</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 9:40pm:</b><br/>
Soon handsome I promise ;)</p><p>Rio’s close, can feel the pool of warmth building in her stomach. She wonders if Agatha is doing the same as her replies begin to come through slower, she isn’t going to be the one to ask though.</p><p>Rio doesn’t respond, just scrolls back up to the picture Agatha sent her again and keeps working her hand. Three minutes later she sees another picture notification flash at the top of her phone and she almost drops her phone on her face again at how fast she moves to click on it.</p><p>If she thought she wasn’t prepared for the last one she is sorely mistaken.</p><p>Agatha is sat propped up against hotel pillows, covers pulled up so they just cover her nipples with her cleavage on full show. Her gorgeous mane of hair sits loosely against her shoulders with her collarbones on full show. Glasses still pushed against her nose and now she has her bottom lip pulled beneath her lips. The sheet clings to her perfectly, leaving nothing to the imagination. Rio has never hated a piece of fabric more for getting to be wrapped around Agatha.</p><p>She keeps looking, taking in the sharpness of her jaw, the perfect shape of her nose and those intense blue eyes teasing her through a screen. It isn’t fair, Rio wants to run her finger down the slope of her nose, graze her teeth along her jaw and watch those blue eyes darken as she slowly comes undone from Rio’s touch.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 9:44pm: </b><br/>
Goodnight handsome, I’ll see you so soon x</p><p>Suddenly Rio is more desperate than she’s ever been before. She feels like she’s just been edged and after some much needed spiralling eventually she falls asleep with Agatha’s name on her lips and the picture engraved in her brain.</p><p>—</p><p>Two days later Rio has about an hour and a half until her dinner reservation and decides that she can’t go another day without seeing Agatha now that she’s back from the conference.</p><p><b>Me 4:55pm:</b><br/>
What time do your clients finish? You got time for an ‘emergency session?’</p><p>The response comes instantly.</p><p><b>Sexy(y) Therapist 4:56pm:</b><br/>
Hmmm, depends why you’re asking?</p><p>All Rio does in response is send her a picture of the outfit she’s wearing in the mirror. A pair of fitted black suit trousers and a long sleeved white shirt with a black waistcoat on top. She rolls her sleeves up to just below the elbow before taking the picture. Her face isn’t in it as she hides it behind her phone, turning her face to the side in an attempt to show off her jawline.</p><p>She looks fucking good. She feels it too and if that confidence is still being caused by the small bulge in her trousers that’s she’s hoping Agatha will notice again? Who can blame her.</p><p>Her phone vibrates straight away with the reply she hoped for.</p><p><b>Sexy(y) Therapist 4:50pm:</b><br/>
Clients are cancelled. Get here now.</p><p>Rio smirks at her response, grabbing her things for the reservation and heading to the subway.</p><p>And if there’s one thing for sure, Rio will always do as she’s told. Especially if those instructions are coming from Agatha Harkness.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio swings the door to Agatha’s office, her body filled with a familiar feeling from when she stood here before telling Agatha she was finally taking control of her life.</p><p>Never could she have imagined that this is how her life would have ended up, feeling like she is on cloud nine, the unfamiliar buzz of excitement for the future thrumming in her chest and getting to make whatever choices she wants without fear or judgement.</p><p>A younger version of herself would have laughed in her face if she could tell them where she is now.</p><p>Rio swings the door of Agatha’s office open, she really had felt prepared for seeing her after the brief time apart, she really did but as her eyes land on Agatha perched on her desk and watches her push off with an eagerness that no one could ever be ready for. Well that confidence she thought she had brought with her shatters as the door clicks closed and Agatha gets closer, the feral glint in her eyes becomes more clear.</p><p>She had not prepared for that.</p><p>Rio barely has time to take her in, doesn’t know what to focus on, she swallows hard and in a panic at how quickly Agatha approaches she drops her things to the floor, bracing for impact.</p><p>She holds her breath, finally managing to let her eyes travel down Agatha’s body, she’s seen the white blouse and slacks combo before but this, this is different. That red lipstick is going to fucking kill her one day.</p><p>Rio’s knees are already weakening beneath her and before her brain can push her to talk Agatha is right in front of her.</p><p>Up close she looks ready to devour Rio whole, her eyes already dark and hungry, her lips parted, her chest flushed showing through the open buttons of her shirt. Rio can feel the heat crawling up her spine, her breathing already sharp and stuttered.</p><p>Agatha reaches out, grabbing Rio’s shirt collar and pushing her firmly against the door. “It’s really hot when you take my advice.”</p><p>“Huh?” Rio replies, far too focused on the warmth of Agatha’s fingers brushing against her neck.</p><p>Agatha grins wide at the flustered mess she has created in front of her and wastes no more time using her hold on Rio’s collar to crash their lips together. Rio’s thoughts barely let her register what’s happening before she folds and melts right into Agatha’s touch. Her hands that had been useless at her sides come up, needing something to hold, to keep her up right, as their mouths work hard enough to bruise. Agatha’s free hand is used to keep Rio restrained against the wood, so all she can do is accept her fate that she is not the one in control today.</p><p>Rio can’t imagine ever wanting to be anywhere else.</p><p>The kiss is filthy, all tongue and teeth, like spending nine days apart after they accepted that they were something more was the hardest thing they had ever had to do. Rio lets it be known by spilling moans down Agatha’s throat with every swipe of her tongue and sinks her nails into her sides to somehow pull her in closer. She swallows every desperate groan Agatha gives her.</p><p>She is sure she stops breathing at some point, her lungs burn but Agatha is relentless and Rio would rather die before ever pulling away.</p><p>She is only snapped out of it when eager hands travel to the buttons on her waistcoat and work away at them like they have personally offended Agatha, she makes quick work of tearing it off Rio’s shoulders and letting it drop to the floor with a soft thud. Rio pants against her lips the whole time, her hands feeling useless as she lets them come back to grip onto Agatha’s hips.</p><p>“<i>Fuck Rio oh my god,</i>” Agatha moans against her mouth, shamelessly pressing herself more firmly against the bulge in Rio’s pants. One hand coming up to grip Rio’s jaw as she presses their lips together again.</p><p>Rio can feel the way her clit begins throbbing against the base of the strap. When she decided to pack in public for the first time, she hadn’t quite expected something like this to happen so fast. She’s so caught up in the feeling of Agatha grinding against her that she doesn’t register it when hands start a slow journey down her chest, palms splaying against her torso.</p><p>The texts, the photos, the nine days of desperation unravelling within minutes of her stepping foot into the room. Her dreams have done her no justice of how good this fucking feels.</p><p>Eventually Rio’s brain plays catch up as those hands venture down further and one looping into her waistband to pull her hips off the door and the other settling against the bulge in her pants. Rio lets her own hands wander, before resting them on the top of her ass, biting gently onto Agatha’s bottom lip as she grinds against her hand lightly.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth starts to wander too, pressing light kisses along Rio’s jaw and when Rio turns her head those warm lips press harder into her neck, making a slow journey down her throat, Rio can feel herself clench around nothing when the kisses turn into soft bites. She is sure Agatha can feel her moans vibrating against her mouth with her touch because her teeth sink deeper and the hand on her crotch presses more firmly and all Rio can do is pray her body lets her last more than five fucking minutes.</p><p>Rio clings onto Agatha’s ass, muttering a few curses to herself as her hips start to chase more friction.</p><p>Agatha chuckles, pulling away from Rio’s neck. “Look at you, you are so fucking handsome aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio blinks, jaw slack, her throat dry, she is not going to survive this.</p><p>“Aren’t you?” Agatha asks again, tone firmer this time, gripping harder against her bulge.</p><p>“Mhm,” Rio moans, that quickly turns to a pathetic whine as she watches Agatha release her hold only for it to turn into a gasp as Agatha drops to her knees.</p><p>If Rio thought she had seen Agatha look feral before, well then this is a new kind of feral that she is sure no one else but Agatha Harkness could manage.</p><p>Rio pants, throwing her head against the wall before looking back down to meet Agatha’s eyes. She wonders how Agatha is going to get to her cunt through the boxers and the strap, silently scolds herself for wearing it, the confusion on Rio’s face is clearly evident as Agatha’s hands begin a slow journey from Rio’s calves to her thighs.</p><p>“You with me?” Agatha says, placing her hands on Rio’s thighs, her voice snapping Rio right back into the moment.</p><p>Rio nods her head rapidly, looking at Agatha with heated desperation.</p><p>“Good, now let me ask you something,” she smirks. “Ever had your dick sucked pretty boy?”</p><p>Rio is convinced that if it wasn’t for Agatha’s hands on her thighs right now she absolutely would have fallen to the floor in shock, she had a dream that this happened once and woke up drenched in sweat and her thighs sticky but she never thought it would actually be something she could have.</p><p>She shakes her head as she watches hands reach for her zipper, the glint in Agatha’s eyes is insane, she looks so fucking excited at the thought of getting to have Rio’s dick in her mouth.</p><p>All Rio can do is watch in awe as Agatha pulls her zipper down slowly with one hand and unclips the clasp with the other. Rio is certain she has never felt her heartbeat in so many different parts of her body at once as she tries to keep her eyes on Agatha’s actions. Rio had used the strapless boxers to pack and had managed to tuck the strap behind two of the buttons. So she gets to watch as Agatha bites her lip as she takes Rio in, watches as she opens her up like the best gift she’s ever been given before she looks up at her through her lashes.</p><p>That stare alone is enough for Rio to feel the warmth pool low in her stomach.</p><p>Once Rio’s trousers are round her ankles, Agatha pushes herself up onto her knees, eyes widening at Rio’s bulge, her lips curling upwards. “What did I tell you? This is <i>so</i> fucking hot.”</p><p>Agatha splays her hand against her again before squeezing lightly, Rio swears she can feel it, like a phantom limb. She can feel the blood pumping round her body and straight to her clit that’s throbbing for attention. Agatha keeps one hand tight on the strap and uses the other to push Rio’s shirt up. Rio had been growing out a small strip of hair on her stomach that Hela used to call ‘gross’ but she didn’t need to think about that, not anymore. When Agatha spots it, her tongue darts out the corner of her mouth and moves it slowly across her lips.</p><p>“Agatha holy shit,” Rio pants, words barely forming in her mouth.</p><p>“Mmm,” Agatha hums looking back up towards her. “This is <i>nothing</i> in comparison to what I have planned for you.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are locked onto her as she presses her lips to Rio’s toned stomach, leaving a perfect red lipstick mark before sticking her tongue out fully and tracing the hair on her stomach with it. Rio moans at the touch causing Agatha to smirk, clearly well aware of the effect her actions are having. It’s slow and warm, it’s making Rio fucking ache for more.</p><p>After her brief torturing stunt Agatha sits back on her heels with a grin. “You ready?”</p><p>Rio nods profusely, if she thought she’d looked desperate before well this is a whole other level.</p><p>“Words my love,” Agatha prompts gently, pressing another light kiss above the waistband of Rio’s boxers.</p><p>“Yes. Fuck. God yes I’m ready,” Rio whines, the pet name makes her dizzy as she reaches out to tilt Agatha’s chin up towards her.</p><p>Agatha drops her hand from Rio’s bulge which causes a small groan of protest to leave her lips.</p><p>Rio watches as she slides the hair tie off her wrist before gathering her hair and quickly throwing it into a messy pony tail near the top of her head.</p><p>For the fiftieth time today, Rio feels fucking faint. She’s never seen Agatha with her hair pulled back and this, this was fucking insane of her. If she wasn’t already soaking through her boxers, she certainly is now. Agatha’s hands move towards her glasses preparing to take them off.</p><p>No, absolutley not. Those have to stay on. Rio uses the hold on Agatha’s chin to stall her and force her to look up.</p><p>“No, please?” Rio asks.</p><p>Agatha smirks back up at her.</p><p>“Keep them on?” Rio pleads.</p><p>Agatha’s smirk only grows as she pulls her bottom lip between her teeth and pushes her glasses back onto her face. “Only because you said please.”</p><p>Rio tries to give her a cocky grin but she has to bite her lip to stop the moan as Agatha moves her fingers to the buttons of Rio’s boxers</p><p>She lets her eyes flutter closed, making an attempt to steady her breathing before she fucking explodes. By the time she opens them again, Agatha is staring back at her, stroking up her length lightly.</p><p>She leans forward, placing a light kiss on the tip of the strap and that movement alone honestly has Rio threatening to come in her pants right there and then. Is this how it is going to happen? All the months without an orgasm threaten to come to an end as soon as Agatha wraps her lips around her cock?</p><p>Rio can feel the way her heart pounds against her chest, she has to force herself not to throw her head back against the door so she can watch exactly what’s happening in front of her, committing every movement to her memory. Agatha’s face right now is something she never wants to forget.</p><p>“Give me your hand,” Agatha commands, gently but still enough to force Rio into bringing her hand up without a second thought.</p><p>“Good boy,” Agatha purrs, wrapping her fingers around Rio’s wrist and guiding her hand to the back of head. “You get where I am going with this?”</p><p>Rio lets out a long breath before sliding her fingers through the tangled curls and getting a good hold of Agatha’s ponytail, biting her lip lightly as Agatha watches her patiently.</p><p>“And these,” Agatha taps her hips. “I want you to use them to show me how much you want this, can you do that?”</p><p>Rio juts her hips out and watches as her cock strokes along the side of Agatha’s cheek, seeing how deep it will reach. “Yes ma’am.”</p><p>Agatha licks her lips and settles her palms flat against Rio’s thighs so that the tip brushes against her bottom lip again. “You can come whenever you want, this time.”</p><p>The room suddenly feels so much smaller, closing the tension in until it threatens to shatter as Agatha runs her tongue underneath from the base to the tip before her lips wrap completely around it.</p><p>“FUCK!” Rio’s hips press forward, she watches as she sinks deeper into Agatha’s mouth, her hold in her hair getting tighter the further it goes.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t move yet, just watches as Rio looks down, her jaw slack as she pulls back and sees herself slick with Agatha’s spit and lets out a low moan, the arousal now definitely seeping out of her boxers and landing warm on her thighs. It’s only when the moan draws out that Agatha starts to move her head, her nails sinking into Rio’s thigh through the fabric. They work in tandem, Rio’s hips setting a slow pace, Agatha meeting every gentle thrust, her eyes not once leaving Rio’s face. The smirk at how much she is enjoying watching Rio come undone is clear even with her mouth wrapped around the silicone.</p><p>Rio is close, she doesn’t know if it’s that there is the perfect amount friction against her clit when she lets herself press in to the back of Agatha throat or the vibrations of the groans of pleasure Agatha lets out with every tug of her hair or the way the blue eyes sparkle up at her with pure want that is doing it. It could be all three at once but either way she has never felt anything like this, never felt so wanted, never felt so comfortable about enjoying something.</p><p>Her dick isn’t that big, five inches, so she doesn’t expect Agatha to enjoy it as much as she is, she lets Rio sit at the back of her throat, lets her pull out all the way and press back in with harder thrusts, letting her take whatever she wants. Agatha’s eyes stay on her at all times, studying what movements pull the loudest moans out of Rio.</p><p>Turns out she really fucking likes it when Agatha’s gags around her cock, its purely performative but when that first gag fills the room Rio’s knees wobbles, her hips stutter and her head crashes against the door. When she pulls herself back to the moment, she gets to watch as spit drips from Agatha’s mouth and watches it drip down her chin onto her chest.</p><p>Rio is ascending. She has to be.</p><p>The pressure building inside her is overwhelming, she grips the top of Agatha’s ponytail and pulls her face forward causing a loud moan to escape the older woman beneath her. She gasps as her orgasm crashes over her, forgetting how fucking intense it could feel, the room spins and she braces her other hand against the door as the silent scream tears up her throat.</p><p>Agatha watches proudly, Rio’s dick still pressed deep in her mouth, putting pressure on Rio’s thighs to keep her up right. It’s only when Rio lets out a final gasp, her grip loosens and hips pull back that Agatha falls back onto her calves and tries to steady her breathing.</p><p>“Holy fuck,” Rio pants, she feels so many emotions at once as she comes back to earth.</p><p>Agatha rises slowly, bringing a gentle hand to Rio’s cheek and brushes her thumb under her eyes and smiles gently. “You look so good when you come.”</p><p>Rio laughs, letting her head rest on Agatha’s forehead, bringing her hands up to pull Agatha in closer to her.</p><p>“I feel so many things right now,” Rio whispers, she can feel tears prickling her eyes and a smile tugging on her lips. “I forgot how good it feels to be wanted, to be able to just let go and enjoy something.”</p><p>“That’s how it should feel,” Agatha replies, letting her lips brush against Rio’s. “You deserve to feel good and I will never hesitate to give that to you.”</p><p>Rio grins against Agatha’s lips, she does get to have this, does get to want it. She lets herself feel every emotion and embraces how fucking amazing it feels. The urge to say thank you is on the tip of her tongue but instead she lets her lips find Agatha’s again and shows her how grateful she is by spinning them in place and presses herself flush to her front and kisses her until they both are gasping for air. Her hands wander playfully up her sides at the same time her lips drag down her neck and she dips her head to run her tongue along her chest, cleaning up the spit that dripped down there earlier. Listening to the little gasps she pulls out of Agatha’s throat as she keeps going until lips are back on hers.</p><p>“Hey handsome,” Agatha sighs, pulling Rio back. “You’re going to be late.”</p><p>Rio groans and checks the clock and sure enough she has to leave now or else she will miss the reservation.</p><p>“Can you do me a favour?” Rio asks, pressing another kiss to Agatha’s lips before stepping away completely.</p><p>Agatha kneels down and helps pull Rio’s trousers back up her thighs. “What's the favour?”</p><p>“Can you keep this safe for me?” Rio grins, pulling the strap out completely from her boxers and holding it awkwardly in her hand. “Please, I only wore it for you.”</p><p>She can feel her cheeks burning as Agatha takes it from her and walks over to her desk and sets it down. However any embarrassment she feels is gone when Agatha turns back round with a smirk, her fingers running along the length of it as she locks her eyes on Rio again.</p><p>“Safe? Sure. Untouched? No promises.”</p><p>Rio walks over to meet her, trousers still undone. “Mm I will be extremely grateful.”</p><p>“You will have to show me how grateful,” Agatha pouts, pulling Rio back into her and zips her back up but not before letting her fingers trace against her lightly, smiling at the way Rio tries to press into the touch.</p><p>“I will,” Rio smiles, bringing her hands up to cup Agatha’s cheeks and kisses her again before she pulls back and makes her way to the door, picking up her waistcoat and the almost forgotten envelope from the floor.</p><p>Agatha waves at her but her other hand is already reaching for the strap that sits shamelessly on her desk. “Good luck.”</p><p>Rio takes a minute when the door closes behind her to let what just happened fully sink in before she pushes herself forward and makes her way down the stairs.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio almost has to crawl towards the restaurant, her legs barely able to hold her up after her first orgasm in what felt like years. She expected to feel embarrassed, coming untouched like that but as soon as she saw that glint in Agatha’s eyes all those feelings of embarrassment? Gone.</p><p>She stands by the entrance to the door, holding the envelope in her hand. She should feel nervous but if anything she’s excited, ready to get this over with and truly set herself free. Before she pushes the door open she pulls out her phone to send Agatha one more text before she goes inside.</p><p>But it appears Agatha has beaten her to it.</p><p><b>Sex(y) Therapist 6:26pm:</b><br/>
Enjoy your <i>date</i> handsome x</p><p>With a video attached.</p><p>And like the absolute oblivious idiot she is, Rio presses play.</p><p>She is all of a sudden extremely grateful she hasn’t taken her airpods out when she hears a moan escape from Agatha’s lips. Her eyes eventually focus onto the video and she watches as Agatha runs her dick through her soaking folds. She’s touching herself, letting herself come undone with Rio’s name falling from her lips.</p><p>Fuck Rio is not prepared for wetness to begin pooling in her boxers again.</p><p>She continues watching as Agatha teases her entrance, and just as she lets the tip push against her the video shuts off.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio whispers, shoving her phone into her pocket, shaking out her thoughts and pushing the restaurant door open.</p><p>She bypasses the host standing in the entrance of the door as she spots exactly who is waiting for her. Her palms sweat as she grips the envelope by her side, sitting down in front of her hopefully soon to be ex-wife. Rio takes her in, the dark circles under her eyes, her roots not touched up. She looks like shit.</p><p>Rio has no idea how this will go for her as she sits down, every single attempt she’s made at communication has been shut down or ignored repeatedly. She’s tried, tried so hard but this is where it stops.</p><p>She places the envelope onto the table, the image of Agatha flashing through her mind. She’s doing this for herself, <i>she’s doing this for a shot at a future with Agatha.</i></p><p>Rio clears her throat.</p><p>“Hela. We need to talk.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It’s rare Agatha gets any time to herself during a work day. Her books are completely full at the moment, seeing clients back to back nine till five every day. But a last minute reschedule leaves her with an hour to herself.</p><p>It’s almost funny. Two months ago Agatha dreaded having time to herself, spending time in her own head terrified her. And sure, being in her head still scares her but hell it is certainly a lot easier when she has Rio to think about.</p><p>
<i>Rio.</i>
</p><p>Agatha has never watched a client grow and flourish the way she has watched Rio, it's almost an honor to see how Rio has gone from hiding herself and allowing the bare minimum to someone who knows exactly what they want and deserve. It’s an incredible thing to witness.</p><p>And to witness it as perhaps something more than being her sex therapist? Wild.</p><p>Agatha would never have believed in a million years that she was allowed to be a part of something that felt so good, would never have believed that she deserved it. But here she is. And maybe she needed to give herself a little more credit for it too.</p><p>She lets her eyes wander over to the snake plant in the corner that seems to be doing pretty well for itself. For someone apparently so terrible with plants, this one seemed to be doing just fine under her care.</p><p>Rio is similar to a plant perhaps, a wallflower that was withering away under the care of a terrible gardener but with a better one, she’s helped that plant grow into something so strong and wonderful, given the plant all the right tools to bloom. One that Agatha has and will continue to nurture and care for as long as she lives.</p><p>
<i>So maybe the snake plant will be just fine under her care.</i>
</p><p>She almost feels excited, excited at the prospect of where her and Rio can go from here. Rio had been brief in the text that she’d sent Agatha after her meeting with Hela, she’d said ‘it’s over. I’ll swing by and see you tomorrow after your clients’ and that was it. Agatha knew Rio was better with her words in person so decided to leave it at that. Her mouth pulls into a smile as she thinks about seeing Rio later, how she can’t wait to see what freedom tastes like.</p><p>She doesn’t even attempt to push these thoughts back anymore, she allows them to settle at the forefront of her mind as she opens her laptop, pulling up her schedule to review her last client's notes.</p><p>And just as she does, her door flies open with a force strong enough to pull it off its hinges.</p><p>She hears her before she sees her.</p><p>“.. you’re sleeping with my fucking wife you whore.”</p><p>Hela.</p><p>Ugh jesus christ.</p><p>Fortunately Agatha is feeling pretty calm, she’s almost feeling prepared for this moment. She knew that if the stories Rio had told her were anything to go by she knew Hela wasn’t going to sign the papers silently.</p><p>Hela marches right over to the desk throwing the papers down at her. She looks furious.</p><p>“Just let yourself right in, no worries!” Agatha exclaims sarcastically. “You got an appointment? I don’t believe my next client goes by the name ‘Fucking Cunt’?”</p><p>“Stop your fucking shit Agatha, you’re sleeping with my wife,” Hela snarls, her spit landing onto Agatha’s desk causing her to scrunch her nose up in disgust.</p><p>Agatha sighs, almost tempted to laugh as Hela paces about in front of her. “Well technically I haven’t slept with her <i>yet.</i>”</p><p>“Oh my fucking god,” Hela exclaims. “Why is my wife trying to leave me for someone like you? What did I do to deserve that?”</p><p>Agatha snorts. “Oh you lost the right to call her your wife a long time ago. She told you then?”</p><p>Hela storms back towards Agatha, slamming her hands onto the wood. “She didn’t have to fucking tell me, your lipstick was all over her shirt collar you cheap fucking slut.”</p><p>
<i>Oops. Agatha hadn’t actually noticed that one. Hot though.</i>
</p><p>“Harsh,” Agatha laughs.</p><p>She watches the way Hela snarls at her, and can see every wrinkle on her stupid face.</p><p>“Do you actually want something from me?” Agatha says, rolling her eyes. She’s pretty impressed by her level of composure because god does she want to smack the living daylights out of this bitch.</p><p>“You’re fucking <i>my</i> wife,” Hela states, moving her face closer and closer to Agatha as she leans over her desk.</p><p>“Hela you might be a fucking asshole but you’re not stupid, we already established this. What do you want?” Agatha feigns a yawn, leaning back into her seat. “You know, it must be <i>really</i> fucking embarassing for you.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“All this,” she gestures towards Hela with her hands. “The what? The most recommended marriage counsellor in the city, having her marriage fall apart? That’s gonna be a tough one to explain to all your investors and clients isn’t it?”</p><p>“Fuck you,” Hela spits.</p><p>“You’re lucky she just filed it under ‘irreconcilable differences’ after everything you did to her.”</p><p>“I did nothing to her, she ruined this for herself,” Hela says, slamming her hands down again.</p><p>All Agatha can do is laugh, <i>this fucking bitch.</i></p><p>“I need her, she makes me look good, she-”</p><p>Agatha interrupts her. “And there’s your fucking problem Hela. You don’t treat her like a person, you treat her like a pawn in the stupid game of your miserable life. You used her, you used her to make you look like a good person. She tried so hard to fit <i>your</i> fucking mould because at one point she genuinely loved you.”</p><p>“You have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“No I do, don’t fucking interupt me,” Agatha pushes herself up from her desk, mirroring Hela’s actions back to her. “And as soon as she stopped fitting that mould, as soon as you deemed her useless, you could no longer use her for your own gain. You lost her. Did you even fucking love her?”</p><p>“Fuck you Agatha. I do. I do love her,” Hela chokes out the obvious lie. The way her face drops completely at the mention of the word ‘love.’</p><p>“No Hela. You love the idea of Rio and what she can do for you and your image. You didn’t love her the way she deserves and she felt so unwanted that she ended up looking for it somewhere else, with someone else who could make her feel that way,” Agatha sighs, her eyes welling at the thoughts of everything Rio had gone through.</p><p>“I’m not signing these papers Agatha, she’s mine,” Hela eventually replies.</p><p>“She’s not anyone’s and she is more aware of that than she ever has been. You don’t even know her anymore, you aren’t aware of the person she is becoming. You want to know what I see? I see a person that has spent her entire life hiding from who she really wants to be because of the things her parents told her and when she was free from that? You just did the exact same things to her, made her fit in your stupid boxes but she is more than that. So much more. You terrified her but you don’t get to have that over her, not anymore.”</p><p>“Bullshit.”</p><p>“No. It’s not fucking ‘bullshit’ Hela, you refused to treat her the way she deserves because she didn’t fit into your stereotype of being with a woman. The amount of love she has to give, you almost destroyed that for her. The way she sees herself? Yeah another thing you pretty much destroyed. But she still believes there’s a good side to people, a good side to life. And that takes some incredible strength to uphold after everything she has been through. Maybe, just maybe, if you had been kinder to her you would get to see the incredible person she always has been.”</p><p>Hela’s face is mere inches from Agatha’s, their heavy breathing filling the silence of the stuffy room.</p><p>“Maybe, just maybe,” Hela mocks, “I would have been kinder, if <i>she</i> was worth being kinder to.”</p><p>And that, that makes something inside of Agatha snap.</p><p>“Fuck you,” she yells raising her hand and smacking it clean against Hela’s cheek, just like Rio had taught her <i>actions not words</i>.</p><p>God she’d been waiting to do that for a long time.</p><p>She feels her palm sting instantly from the harsh contact against Hela’s face. Hela’s hand replaces hers instantly on her cheek, stumbling back from her hold on the desk. Agatha wastes no time, taking Hela’s stunned silence as an opportunity to round the desk towards her.</p><p>Agatha grabs the papers from her desk and shoves them against Hela’s chest. “Sign the papers or don’t fucking sign them, I don’t care. But she isn’t yours anymore, you don’t get to hurt her. Not under my watch.”</p><p>“What the fuck, I-” Hela stumbles, suddenly not looking quite so smug anymore.</p><p>Agatha walks towards the door, swinging it open. “Save it, you don’t deserve my time. Now get the fuck out of my office.”</p><p>Hela stays silent, slowly moving towards the door and past Agatha. Just as she turns for the staircase, Agatha yells for her.</p><p>“Hela?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Come near me, or her, again and trust me it’ll be more than a slap that stuns you into silence,” Agatha threatens, slamming her door behind her.</p><p>Agatha knows that it won’t be the last she hears from Hela but she knows that will keep her quiet, for now.</p><p>—-</p><p>Rio walks with purpose into Agatha’s clinic, nodding at her last client of the day as they pass. It’s quiet, most of the lights turned off except for a lamp in the waiting room and a soft glow coming out from underneath Agatha’s door, everyone else having clearly left for the day.</p><p>She continues striding towards the door, contemplates knocking but the day she’s had has no time for all that. So she steps in, watches as Agathas startles before her eyes soften once they meet hers from across the room. Glasses perching on the end of nose, the pen in her hand clatters against the desk as she leans back and raises her eyebrows at her.</p><p>“I don’t see clients after six,” she smirks as she lets her eyes roam down taking in Rio’s outfit, the approval evident as she grips the side of her chair tighter.</p><p>“Good thing you haven’t charged me for a single ‘session’ then,” Rio replies as she makes her way across the room, dropping her blazer on the opposite seat and rounds the desk.</p><p>Agatha lets out a huffed laugh, rolling her seat back so Rio can perch on the desk in front of her. She tries to reach hand out clearly trying to loop her fingers around the suspenders clinging to Rio’s chest but instead of letting her Rio drops the envelope tucked under arm into her lap.</p><p>“You won’t believe the day I’ve had,” Rio says as she crosses her arms, cocking her eyebrow towards the envelope.</p><p>“I bet mine was far more interesting,” Agatha replies while pulling out the sheets of paper and Rio watches as she presses her tongue to her cheek before looking back up at her. “I met your wife today.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes almost fall out of head at how hard she gawks. “Fuck okay, this makes a lot more sense to me now.”</p><p>
<i>When Rio had handed the papers to Hela she had laughed so loud the whole restaurant had snapped their heads around and Rio had wanted the ground to swallow her whole. It was only when Rio stared blankly, a loose smile on her lips that it actually seemed to sink in and Hela realised she was serious. The laughter turning into fury, her eyes sharpening across the table, lips twitching in a snarl as she spoke through gritted teeth.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You think you get to just walk away from me?” Hela spat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio smiled, for once the tone hadn’t caused her to retreat, it actually only solidified the fact she couldn’t have been happier to be setting herself free from all of this.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yes,” Rio replied plainly, she stood and dropped the papers on the table. “Sign the papers or don’t. Either way we are done and have been for a long time Hela. You don’t get to use me anymore and for the sake of everyone please seek help before you attempt to ruin any other woman foolish enough to not see you for what you are.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“And what’s that?” Hela seethed, unbothered by the eyes still on them.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“A massive fucking cunt,” Rio grinned, tucking her chair back under the table. “I’d say good luck but I quite honestly don’t have it in me to wish you anything good right now.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had taken great pleasure at watching Hela’s jaw drop as she walked out of the restaurant. Feeling almost weightless, like the final claws that had held her into something she had never deserved finally had been ripped out.</i>
</p><p>Agatha throws the papers on her desk and stands, stepping in between Rio’s legs, her hands coming to settle flat on her thighs as she does. She watches as Rio mentally tries to work out how Hela had found out about Agatha, why she had the audacity to show up at her place of work but the only real answer she wants is what Agatha had said to get her to sign the papers?</p><p>“What happened?” Rio asks, only momentarily distracted by the low cut of Agatha's dress as her eyes flicker down. Her hands come up to linger against Agatha's neck, pulling her in closer. “What did you say to her?”</p><p>There is a devilish glint in Agatha’s eyes as she lets Rio tug her in closer and it sends a jolt of pleasure straight down her spine.</p><p>“Enough,” Agatha smirks, her hands slowly venturing up Rio’s legs and fumbling with her button and zip. She bites her lip as her fingers settle on what she had clearly been hoping for. “She’s a real piece of work.”</p><p>Rio can only watch as Agatha pulls open her desk drawer, pulling out her strap from a bag and locks her eyes back on Rio’s as she threads it through the ring with a smile.</p><p>“Entitled energy from the minute she walked in,” Agatha keeps talking, her lips lingering close to Rio’s. “I don’t think she was expecting me to be ready for her.”</p><p>The way Agatha talks, her voice low and dripping with a possessiveness Rio hadn’t been ready for hits her low in her stomach. Rio wants to hear more, wants Agatha to keep talking like that, looking at her like that. She wants nothing more than to feel her touch with that same energy right now.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio groans as Agatha teases up the length of the strap.</p><p>She’s not afraid to use the new confidence that has radiated off her since Agatha had been on her knees for her. She has never felt so sure of who she is and what she wants in her life. So she watches for Agatha’s reaction as she pulls the hand off the strap and pulls it up to her mouth and spits into her palm and leads it back down to grip back round her length before leaning back in to whisper against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“Tell me more.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitches momentarily at the change in Rio’s tone and tight grip of Rio’s fingers around her wrist before she relaxes, grinning wide and feral back at her.</p><p>“Someone’s feeling brave, one orgasm from getting your dick sucked is all it took hm?” Agatha teases as her hand starts making a slow pace against the strap.</p><p>“Are you complaining about the confidence you have helped create?”</p><p>The flush crawling up Agatha's chest tells Rio everything she needs to know.</p><p>“Not at all,” Agatha bites Rio's bottom lip gently. “It’s hot… It suits you.”</p><p>Rio grunts against Agatha's mouth as she works quicker against her, every stroke feels so deliberate, every brush of their lips feels like torture as Agatha doesn’t give her anything more than that.</p><p>“She called me a ‘cheap fucking slut’, Agatha pouts. “She has a way with words.”</p><p>Right now it’s Rio that’s feeling like a cheap slut, her boxers already slick as she tries to match Agatha’s pace. But she is going to try and hold out, she has to. So she breathes out slowly before asking. “And are you?”</p><p>“For you?” Agatha grinds the base of the strap down hard and chuckles when Rio whines against her mouth. “Yeah <i>fuck</i>, I’d let you do anything you wanted, so maybe she’s right.”</p><p>Rio has to dig her nails into Agatha’s neck to focus on not coming right there and then, has to close her eyes so she can avoid the fact that Agatha has never looked more serious in her life. She means it and Rio doesn’t have the ability to know what to do with all that when she’s three seconds away from ruining the desk underneath her.</p><p>“What else happened?” Rio finally chokes out, braving looking at Agatha.</p><p>Big mistake.</p><p>Those blue eyes lock onto hers and Rio knows she’s fucked, knows she will never be able to look at anyone else every again and not wish she was looking at Agatha instead. Someone might say she is ruined but Rio feels anything but that as she pants pathetically into the most perfect parted lips she has ever had the pleasure of meeting.</p><p>“So much talking,” Agatha sighs dramatically, the heat hitting Rio’s lips sending another wave of pleasure through her. “She loves the sound of her own voice, luckily I love the sound of my own more and I am much better at using it.”</p><p>Rio has to bring one hand down to keep herself secure on the desk, each stroke of Agatha’s hands hitting her perfectly every time. It’s almost too much. Before she can even respond, Agatha continues, voice low against her lips.</p><p>“I think the fact I slapped her might have really been what done it,” Agatha chuckles as Rio’s hips buck off the desk and she gasps at the way the movement hits against her clit just right. “She didn’t have much to say after that.”</p><p>“Oh fuck,” Rio moans, her nails digging in harder to the skin of Agatha neck. “Don’t stop.”</p><p>“Oh baby, are you close already?” Agatha purrs, pulling back when Rio tries to kiss her, leaving her panting against her chin as she grinds the base of the strap against her with more purpose. “I wiped the smug look right off her face, I wish you could have seen it.”</p><p>“Me too,” Rio mewls, her hips starting to stutter and her breathing ragged. “S-so so close.”</p><p>“I used this hand for that too,” Agatha grins, pressing down harder. “Almost had to peel her off the floor to kick her out.”</p><p>Rio’s muscles tense and the long moan that rips up her throat vibrates against the walls as she comes hard and fast. It should be a crime to come at the thought of your soon to be ex-wife getting her shit rocked by the woman that is absolutley ruining her for anyone else. It shouldn’t be as hot as it is but Rio has never felt so fucking good in her life.</p><p>Agatha works her through it, panting against Rio’s mouth as she watches her fall apart in front of her.</p><p>“You’re perfect,” Rio mumbles before giving Agatha no choice but to fold into her as she presses her lips firmly against hers and keeps muttering the words through broken breaths.</p><p>Agatha hums, the hand on the strap moving slowly into the waistband of Rio’s boxer and dragging slowly through her, letting her arousal drip onto her fingers before pulling them out and replacing her mouth with them.</p><p>Rio takes them willingly, letting the taste of herself settle on her tongue. Her eyes locked on Agatha’s as she sucks her fingers way longer than is needed but she is enjoying the soft moans it pulls from Agatha’s throat way too much.</p><p>She had forgotten how good it tastes when you want something so badly.</p><p>“Tell me what you taste like,” Agatha leans in, whispering against her ear.</p><p>Rio drags her back to her mouth with a light grip on her chin and presses her thumb to Agatha's bottom lip until she parts them for her. “It’s much better if you taste it for yourself.”</p><p>Agatha’s moan vibrates against her teeth as Rio lets her tongue press into her mouth, her own noise almost feral as Agatha sucks it lightly.</p><p>“Pretty good right?” Rio smirks, pulling back.</p><p>Rio is yanked further forward on the desk until her feet settle on the floor and she is pressing flushed to Agatha's chest and her lips ghost against hers again. “So fucking delicious.”</p><p>There is no time for Rio to even respond or process what has just happened because as soon as she tries to lean into Agatha again it's interrupted with a tug on her suspenders and her feet are moving before she even realises what is happening.</p><p>Agatha looks stunning in the soft light as she leads Rio across the room, her bottom lip pulled between her teeth, her hair wild from the long day as it cascades down her back. And Rio realises she would follow her willingly every single time.</p><p>It isn’t until she hits the sofa with a loud ‘oof’ that she snaps back into the moment and realises what is happening. The room suddenly becomes much hotter and her palms are getting clammy as she watches Agatha drag the lace down her thighs and those same thighs straddle over Rio’s. The air is sucked out of her lungs as she feels the heat of Agatha pressing against her and hands come to settle on her shoulders.</p><p>“Where’s that confidence you had five minutes ago pretty boy?” Agatha pouts, her lips coming down to tease against Rio’s jaw. “I know that’s not all you have in you.”</p><p>Rio breathes out slowly, her own hands coming up, fingers tracing slowly up the outside of Agatha’s thighs. “What, I can't have a thirty second freak out about how hot you are?”</p><p>She can feel the grin as it forms, pressing against her cheek as Agatha slowly finds her way back to press a soft kiss to the corner of Rio’s mouth before pulling away.</p><p>“This isn’t about me today, this is about you and how fucking proud I am of you,” Agatha sighs, pulling Rio’s chin until she looks up at her. “But I can ride you while I tell you how proud I am.”</p><p>Rio chokes on a whimper as the words hit her, if she wasn’t sitting down she is sure the room would be spinning. “I-, fuck, you’re incredible.”</p><p>“Didn’t you just tell me I was perfect? Now this? I might walk out here with a complex.”</p><p>Agatha tries to grin but it's cut short as Rio’s fingers make their way under her dress, her thumbs now brushing against the inside of her thigh. Rio likes seeing her stumble, it’s brief but it's there and that’s enough for any doubt to fade away and she lets her hands keep moving.</p><p>“Oh baby, I think you already know that you are both of those things and more,” Rio smirks, watching the way Agatha’s cheeks start to change colour. At the pet name or the words she isn't sure but she loves it either way. “Now what was that about riding me?”</p><p>The gasp that leaves Agatha’s lips is addicting as Rio finally lets her fingers dip between her thighs and she has to bite back a moan at how wet she is.</p><p>“Fuck Agatha, have you been like this the whole time?” Rio groans as it drips down into her palm.</p><p>She finds Agatha looking at her eyes almost flickering closed as she rocks her hips against the touch. Rio stills her hand and lets Agatha grind shamelessly against her, watching the crease start to form when her eyebrows pinch together as she chases the pleasure. Rio really can’t say much as her own arousal is warm against her thighs, her body begging for another release like she didn't almost evaporate from the last one.</p><p>“I need you.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t even need to tug that hard on Agatha’s hip because she’s already moving. Her body knowing exactly what it wants as Agatha hovers, aligning perfectly with the tip of the strap, letting out a soft whine as it teases against her. Rio lets her hand slide up to grip her other hip, watching with her lip pulled between her teeth as Agatha sinks down slowly.</p><p>“Oh fuck,” Agatha cries out, hands come up to slide into Rio’s hair, nails scraping against her scalp as Rio fills her.</p><p>“And here I thought you’d prefer something much bigger,” Rio laughs, pressing her lips to Agatha's throat so she can feel the hum of her moans against them.</p><p>“Why do you have something bigger for me?” Agatha pushes Rio back against the sofa again forcing her to watch as she grinds down fully.</p><p>Rio smirks, using the hold on Agatha’s hips to keep her still, the little whine she lets out at not being able to move is adorable. “You’ll just have to be good for me and maybe you’ll find out.”</p><p>Agatha pouts and really no one can blame Rio for wanting to give her whatever she wants when she looks at her like that. She’s only human. She watches as the same lips curl up onto a grin as she loosens her hold and Agatha wastes no time in taking full advantage.</p><p>“You always going to give me what I want so easily?”</p><p>Rio presses her tongue to her cheek, rolling her eyes at such a ridiculous question, like the answer isn’t obvious. “You always gonna look this good while asking for it?”</p><p>“Obviously,” Agatha gasps, fake offence in her tone as she tugs at the hair at the back of Rio’s neck.</p><p>Rio hums, thrusting her hips upwards and the noise it pulls out of Agatha has her cursing at her body for being so weak for how close she is already. From struggling to come a few weeks ago to being this weak, it is almost impressive.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha moans, chasing the feeling by working herself faster against the strap. “Tell me how you broke the news to her.”</p><p>Oh… So she got off on it as much as Rio did?</p><p>“I-,” Rio pauses. “I told her I deserved better, more, anything that was not what she had been giving me.”</p><p>“And you believe that?”</p><p>“Yes, god yes,” Rio breathes out, struggling to form coherent sentences now with the way Agatha is somehow hitting her clit perfectly with every snap of her hips. “I told her she wasn’t getting to take up space in my life anymore, that I was putting myself first and finding happiness in places that she wouldn’t get to taint ever again.”</p><p>“Fuck Rio keep talking.”</p><p>Rio lets her hands slide down to grab Agatha’s ass, helping her movements, the angle must adjust slightly as broken moans hit the air. She can feel the build up under her touch and she’s not sure how much longer she can last if Agatha keeps gasping so perfectly against her ear.</p><p>“She told me I didn’t get to just walk away from her,” Rio lets her teeth sink in harshly against Agatha’s pulse point, digs her nails in a little harder. “So I did, I walked away and didn’t look back.”</p><p>Agatha pulls her head back then and looks at her, eyes half lidded, lips parted as soft breaths hit against Rio’s lips before she whispers far too gently for the moment they are in. “I am so fucking proud of you.”</p><p>“I also called her a ‘a massive fucking cunt’,” Rio grins, watching as Agatha’s eyes roll back and her hips start to stutter.</p><p>“I bet she was furious,” Agatha finally manages to reply, one hand coming round to grip Rio’s jaw and forcing her head to the side as her mouth makes a slow journey across her cheek and presses against her ear again. “Did it feel good?”</p><p>Rio’s grip tightens, every muscle in her body screaming at her to let go. “Yes so fucking good.”</p><p>“You did that <i>my</i> love,” Agatha purrs. “That was all you.”</p><p>
<i>Fuck.</i>
</p><p>Her body snaps, hips thrusting up hard and fast as the words hit her, <i>’my</i> love’. It doesn’t help that Agatha keeps her grip tight on her jaw and watches as Rio comes undone underneath her, and doesn't let her shy away from enjoying it. Her hips keep bucking as the orgasm ripples through her, she’s not sure where her moan starts and Agatha’s ends.</p><p>“Oh god,” Agatha cries out, her hand going slack and falling back to Rio’s shoulder. “FUCK!”</p><p>Rio gasps, fighting past the tiredness in her limbs as she tries to keep working her hips at that exact pace, watching as Agatha’s eyebrows pinch together and her mouth goes slack, her head crashing against Rio’s and she lets a long guttural moan hit against Rio’s cheek.</p><p>“Holy fuck,” Rio whispers, she can feel the warmth seeping through her trousers, can feel it as every muscles in Agatha’s body relaxes as she slumps against Rio’s chest. “Wow.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a tired laugh against her. “Wow? That’s what you went with?”</p><p>“Did you just come from watching me come in my pants or am I dreaming?”</p><p>“Don’t let it get to your head,” Agatha groans as she peels herself off Rio and sits back. She hasn’t looked more beautiful Rio reckons, skin glistening, chest still heaving as she leans back into her.</p><p>Rio can feel the shit eating grin forming, and can feel the warmth spreading as she meets her halfway. “Too late.”</p><p>“Stop talking and kiss me.”</p><p>She could never say no to that.</p><p>—-</p><p>Agatha doesn’t quite remember how she ends up with her head lying against Rio legs but she does. They sit in silence with Rio’s fingers threaded through her hair rubbing soothing circles against her scalp.</p><p>Rio sighs from above her. “You’re perfect, you’re fucking insane but my god are you perfect.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a breathy chuckle, letting herself fall deeper into Rio’s comfort. She almost feels safe. It’s a feeling she thought she’d never experience again.</p><p>They sit there for a few moments in silence, the rhythm of their breathing subconsciously aligning.</p><p>“I know we’ve said it, but I really am serious about this Rio, serious about us. I want you,” she says, grateful to be lying down, things are sometimes easier when she’s not staring into those brown eyes.</p><p>“Me too, more than anything,” Rio replies, moving the hand from her hair and placing it lightly against Agatha’s face. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt this way about something, about someone ever.”</p><p>“Me either, certainly didn’t think I’d be feeling it at forty years old either,” she laughs, pushing herself off Rio’s legs to sit up and look at her properly. “I meant what I said you know.”</p><p>”Mmm?”</p><p>“I’m so proud of you, what you’ve been through, the person you’re becoming, all of it. So fucking proud.”</p><p>Agatha feels the tears well in her eyes again, unsure how such an intense moment had led them here. “And the fact you’ve been through all those years of hurt yet you’re still letting me in, still letting me witness all of it. That’s special Rio. I don’t think you understand how lucky I feel to get to be a part of all that.”</p><p>She spots the familiar glint of tears in Rio’s eyes as she reaches to place a comforting hand on her knee.</p><p>“I don’t think you understand how lucky I am that you want to be a part of it. So fucking lucky. And this must be scary for you, please don’t think I’m taking it for granted. We can take this as slow as you want, as slow as you need. I promise,” Rio sighs, reaching out her hand to cup Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>“We’ll just take all this day by day huh?” Agatha replies.</p><p>She sighs deeply, like a weight has been lifted off her shoulders at Rio’s understanding. She didn’t even need to tell Rio that she is still nervous, Rio just knows.</p><p>She sees her.</p><p>“I’m done fucking around now,” Rio laughs, turning the situation before it became too emotional. “Let me do it properly, let me show you all the love I have to give, the love that you deserve, please?”</p><p>Agatha leans forward brushing her lips lightly against Rio’s. She can feel the way Rio smiles against her, a soft laugh floating between them.</p><p>“Yeah? You want to date me, Rio Vidal?” Agatha teases between kisses.</p><p>“Mhm fuck yeah I do,” Rio retorts pushing Agatha playfully on the shoulder. “Who knows I might even take you back to my place after.”</p><p>“You’re an idiot.”</p><p>Rio grins back at her like that’s the most obvious statement in the world.</p><p>“Saturday then?”</p><p>Agatha is sure she has never seen certainty in Rio’s eyes like this before, the way she looks at Agatha with such care and positivity is overwhelming in the best way.</p><p>“Saturday,” Agatha nods back at Rio. “I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The days since Agatha last saw Rio have passed torturously slowly, back to back clients and dinner with Jen and Alice meant that she rarely had time for Rio which fucking sucked. She’s still getting used to having Rio in her life as well as still getting used to loving her own company too.</p><p>They’ve caught up with each other where they can, ten minute phone calls just to hear the other's voice and Rio’s been driving her insane with pictures of her at work. Her tan skin glowing in the sunlight and those stupid fucking abs that are driving her wild.</p><p>But finally, after four days apart, it is Saturday and Agatha is currently antagonising herself in front of the mirror whilst she decides what to wear. She hasn’t been on a date in <i>years</i> so when Rio texts her saying ‘casual clothes, no office attire allowed’ she mentally freaks out. Oh and she has absolutely no idea what they are doing for said date.</p><p>She’s seen Rio in casual clothes before, saw it in the ‘sessions’ every week but she has no idea where to start. It reminds her how sad her life was before Rio. She’d spend her nine to five in her office clothes and change into pajamas as soon as she got in the door and then spent her weekends trying to avoid the outside world. So sue her for not having a lot of casual clothing.</p><p>Agatha turns towards her bed and realises she’s not seen her room this messy since she was a teenager, clothes strewn all over her bed. She glances at the clock realising that she has about thirty minutes till she needs leave to pick Rio up because of course Rio doesn’t have a license. Maybe that’s her own fault for dating a twenty seven year old, it’s probably cool to not have a license now.</p><p>
<i>Dating.</i>
</p><p>God that is an insane thought to have. But that’s what they are doing right? Dating each other, getting to know each other, being with each other.</p><p>Just as she picks up a pair of sage green wide leg jeans from her bed, the doorbell rings pulling her out of her thoughts. Strange, she hasn’t ordered anything nor is she expecting anyone but she quickly pulls the jeans over her legs and runs down the stairs to the door.</p><p>Agatha looks out the window to the side and there is no one standing there but she pulls the door open anyway to see if she could see what she had missed. No one is in sight on her street and just as she goes to close the door, something catches her eye on the doorstep.</p><p>“Oh my god,” she whispers as she leans to pick up the bunch of perfectly arranged purple azaleas sitting in a box on her doorstep.</p><p>The confusion clouds her brain as she carries them into the hallway and sets them down on the side table. She assumes it's a mistake, who would be buying her flowers?</p><p>But then her brain clicks, there very much is someone who would be buying her flowers. Agatha picks the card up with shaking hands, her brain reminding her that this is what she’s always deserved. The card reads:</p><p>
<i>These reminded me of you, I can’t wait to see you later.</i>
</p><p>And signed off with a cursive R at the end.</p><p>Agatha can’t help the tears that slowly roll down her cheeks, she can’t decide what meant more to her, the fact that Rio had remembered her favourite flowers or the fact that she has given her flowers at all or maybe that it is that someone is just as excited to see her as she is them.</p><p>She runs back up her stairs like an excited teenager and shoots a text to Rio.</p><p><b>Me 1:38pm:</b><br/>
So that’s what you wanted my address for?! Thank you.</p><p><b>Me 1:39pm:</b><br/>
I can’t wait to see you either handsome, I’ll pick you up in twenty minutes.</p><p>Agatha turns back to the clothes on her bed and settles on a white sweater to pair with her jeans, there’s no time to do anything with her hair but she’s noticed how much Rio likes it naturally so just leaves it and runs back down the stairs. She slips on a pair of black loafers, grabs her keys and heads towards her car.</p><p>Twenty minutes later she pulls up outside Rio’s new place and spots a nervous looking Rio standing on the doorstep.</p><p>God she looks good. Agatha’s glad to see that she seems to have matched the casual instructions perfectly as she takes in Rio’s outfit. She’s wearing light blue faded jeans with a band shirt that she has clearly ripped the sleeves off to make it into a tank, paired with sunglasses and her unbrushed hair sitting perfectly.</p><p>Rio doesn’t seem to notice that Agatha’s arrived so she presses the horn once causing Rio to jump before running over to the car. Agatha can’t help the huge smile that takes over her face as Rio runs towards her, matching that exact same face back at her.</p><p>Rio throws the car door open, wasting no time to reach over the middle console and pull Agatha’s lips against hers. The breath is stolen from Agatha’s lungs as she smiles against Rio’s lips, kissing her back. She’s unprepared for the heat that forms in her stomach, all of a sudden desperate for Rio’s touch.</p><p>“Mmm baby,” Rio moans. “God I’ve missed you.”</p><p>Eventually Rio remembers the car door is very much open and slumps back into her seat, pulling it shut.</p><p>“I missed you too, maybe we should just go inside and have a date in your bedroom instead?” she says, attempting to push her luck.</p><p>Rio laughs, reaching for the GPS and punching in an address. “Don’t get me wrong I would love that but I have a day planned for us and who knows, maybe you’ll get to see my dinosaur bedsheets later.”</p><p>Agatha whips her head round to look at her. “You’re kidding right?,” she laughs.</p><p>“Maybe, you’ll have to wait and see, now come on our slots in fifteen minutes.”</p><p>So Agatha drives them all the way there still no clue what the date is going to be and the only thing she’s working with to guess is the zip code.</p><p>“Hey is that ‘the road’ on your shirt?” Agatha asks around ten minutes into the journey.</p><p>Rio looks down at her shirt. “Fuck yeah, I love them!”</p><p>Agatha smirks. “Thought you would’ve been too young for them.”</p><p>“Oh hardly, stop teasing me and keep your eyes on the road gorgeous.”</p><p>Eventually they pull into the car park and Agatha instantly realises where they are.</p><p>A fucking animal sanctuary. Surely not?</p><p>“Rio, I- this is not quite what I had in mind, I hate to break it to you,” Agatha says, flicking the engine off and turning towards a grinning Rio in the passenger seat.</p><p>“I know,” Rio smirks back at her. “Come on, let's go.”</p><p>Rio jumps out the car as Agatha mentally braces herself for whatever disaster awaits her behind those doors and before she has the chance to attempt to call it quits, Rio opens her car door and offers her a hand to get out of the car.</p><p>She exhales, grabbing the hand in front of her deciding that she might as well give it a shot if she wants to get to know Rio properly. She’s a little bit intrigued by it all for some weird reason.</p><p>As soon as Agatha gets out of the car, Rio attempts to drop her hand but Agatha doesn’t give her the chance, squeezing it lightly to give Rio the reassurance that if she wants to hold her hand, she can. Agatha hadn’t expected that herself, hadn’t expected to want to keep a hold of Rio’s hand but when that rough palm brushed her own, she didn’t want to drop it ever again.</p><p>They make their way through the glass doors, walking right past the staff members who all greet Rio with cheery grins and polite exchanges which just confuses Agatha further.</p><p>“Rio are you a fucking regular here?” Agatha laughs as they eventually stop in the first room.</p><p>Rio turns to face her, awkwardly running a hand through her hair. “Uh… Yeah, my office is about a twenty minute walk from here. I’ve been using it sort of like an escape over the past few years and I help them out with their plants sometimes too,” she shrugs, a crimson colour taking over her face.</p><p>Rio looks like she’s bracing for impact, looks like she’s waiting for Agatha to be rude about being here like she’s going to make Rio feel bad for finding comfort in something. Hela might have done that, but Agatha would never.</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha responds, doing her best to give Rio a reassuring nod. “Want to introduce me to some of them then?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes sparkle like a kid on Christmas day. “Really?”</p><p>“Mhm, but I am going to stand in this very corner whilst you show me from very far away okay?” Agatha’s voice raises as Rio speed walks towards one of the cages.</p><p>Agatha stands in the corner, arms crossed as she watches Rio fuss over an animal and is absolutely far from prepared when Rio walks towards her with a-</p><p>“Oh my god Rio is that a fucking taranula,” Agatha shrieks, backing herself further into the corner. “Nonono, absolutely not, do not bring that thing over here.”</p><p>Rio has the biggest shit eating grin covering her face as she holds the creature up beside her cheek. “Agatha meet my baby Victoria.”</p><p>“You have got to be kidding me,” Agatha mutters under her breath, pinching her nose between her fingers. “Rio I’m so serious, keep it away from me.”</p><p>Beside the fact that Agatha is absolutely very unimpressed with all this, she can’t help but feel slightly endeared. Seeing Rio so comfortable with herself in a place that clearly makes her happy. Agatha can’t help but enjoy that.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whines, stretching her name out. “Wanna hold her?”</p><p>“Rio. No. Fuck no,” she laughs.</p><p>“What about a little kiss?” she asks, placing a light kiss against the top of the tarantula. “See. Look, she wants to give you a kiss so badly.”</p><p>Agatha honestly cannot help the smile that takes over her face, she was meant to be stood in this corner pretending to hate it. Putting up that ‘Agatha Harkness’ front that she is so good at but Rio has this easy ability to break that wall down so easily.</p><p>“Rio I’m not kissing the spider, please put her back.”</p><p>“She has a name,” Rio pouts, raising an eyebrow as she turns her back to Agatha walking towards the cage.</p><p>“Nice try, no chance,” Agatha responds, eventually taking Rio’s hand back in hers so they can move to the next room.</p><p>They make their way through a room full of rabbits and guinea pigs which Agatha can admit she enjoys a lot more than looking at the tarantula, she even gets one out to cuddle it and would never admit to Rio that she actually is sad to move onto the next room away from him. She’s having a way better time than she imagined when she saw that sign outside, seeing Rio so free from her thoughts and her life is everything, everything to her.</p><p>The final room is outside, a huge building made from glass panelling. Rio turns over her shoulder to smile at her as she holds the door open for Agatha to the enclosure and Agatha sees them right away as she steps in. The entire room is full of butterflies. She almost laughs at how silly it all is but can’t deny her own butterflies that have been in her stomach since she woke up this morning.</p><p>“Wanna stand here?” Rio points to a railing, pulling Agatha into her arms.</p><p>Agatha lets herself be pulled in, standing in front of Rio who leans against the railing as she wraps her hands round Agatha’s waist, resting her chin on her shoulder. They stand in silence as they watch the butterflies, Agatha is sure she’s never seen such a beautiful sight as they float round the tropical garden.</p><p>Rio uses the grip on Agatha’s waist to spin her round slowly and Agatha instinctively throws her hands over Rio’s shoulders, smiling as her eyes lock onto those deep hazelnut ones that she could so easily get lost in.</p><p>“And here I thought the most beautiful thing here is the butterflies,” Rio shamefully flirts.</p><p>And Agatha just cannot help the smile on her face because no matter how ridiculous this is, it feels right. It feels like this is exactly where she has always meant to be and exactly who she has always meant to be with.</p><p>Rio reaches out to tuck a strand of loose hair behind her ears as she leans in to kiss her. It’s all so disgustingly cliche but Agatha can’t stop herself from leaning into it, their lips brushing against one another softly at first. If you’d asked her six months ago she would’ve felt physically sick at the thought of public displays of affection but right now she doesn’t care who sees them or what they think, she just wants it to be with Rio.</p><p>The kiss doesn’t last long, just long enough to clearly make them both feel it. Rio pulls away first, looking into Agatha’s eyes as she pushes her thumb against her face lightly.</p><p>“Do you want to come back for dinner? I bought enough pasta to cook for two,” Rio asks shyly, still keeping those eyes locked onto Agatha’s.</p><p>“Mm I forgot you told me you can cook, that’s hot” she grinning, placing another light kiss to Rio’s lips. “Yes I’d love to, shall we?”</p><p>—</p><p>Rio places a perfectly plated pasta dish in front of Agatha before sitting opposite her. It’s not that she hadn’t expected Agatha to say yes to dinner but more that she didn’t think she’d actually work up the courage to ask.</p><p>She had also expected the date to be awkward which it hadn’t been, not even close. Despite the facade that Agatha put up in some of the animal rooms, Rio could tell she was enjoying herself, could tell she didn’t want to be anywhere else. Neither did Rio.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha moans as she spoons the pasta into her mouth. “Rio this is so good what the fuck?”</p><p>“Yeah?” she laughs, taking a sip of her beer. “It’s my favourite, I’ve been making it for years.”</p><p>She almost forgets to eat her own pasta, so caught up in just staring at Agatha. How beautiful she looks in a domestic setting, it is so different to seeing her in her harsh office light but it felt so right all the same.</p><p>They sit round the table for what feels like hours, sharing jokes and stories. Rio shares upcoming builds she has over the next few weeks and tells her about the intern she just hired to work with them too. Agatha talks about Jen and the plans for their clinic in the future and Rio can only hope that she gets to witness it all come to life. At one point Agatha reaches for Rio’s hand across the table and Rio doesn’t even think and takes it into her own straight away.</p><p>It doesn’t feel like a first date, it feels like they’ve been sitting at this table with each other for years the way they fall into a routine so easily. Eventually, Rio stands to clear the plates and wash them at the sink, she puts on music quietly in the background and they fall back into that familiar silence as she washes up whilst Agatha finishes her wine.</p><p>She hears Agatha lightly hum along to the music and Rio says a silent prayer that this night will never end and even when it does, she hopes she gets the chance to have this again. Rio’s pulled away from her thoughts when Agatha places her chin on her shoulder, pressing a light kiss against her cheek.</p><p>“Today has been perfect, thank you.”</p><p>Rio smiles softly, elated that Agatha seems to have had just as much of a good time as her.</p><p>“It has, it really really has.”</p><p>Agatha sighs. “Rio I’ll be honest, I don’t want this night to end.”</p><p>“Me either,” Rio whispers lightly in response.</p><p>“Please ask me to stay.”</p><p>Rio nearly drops the plate into the sink in shock, she could run a lap at how giddy those words have just made her feel, at how her heart starts beating against her chest.</p><p>“I’ve been wanting to ask you all night, I just didn’t know how,” Rio laughs awkwardly. “Stay? Please?”</p><p>“I thought you’d never ask.”</p><p>—</p><p>Eventually the dishes are done, drinks are finished and they can feel the tension pulling them towards each other. Rio leads Agatha to her bedroom, there’s no rush for either of them. It’s just the two of them wanting to take care of the other.</p><p>It isn’t so much of a nervousness that Rio can feel bubbling in her stomach but this feels different from the other times they have had each other like this. It’s obvious in the gentleness of their hands as they touch much more delicately, there is no rush, it's not hungry and eager, the world seems to have slowed down. The quiet hum of the AC and their breaths are the only thing that fill the room as Rio’s hands tease under Agatha’s sweater, meeting warm, soft skin.</p><p>“May I?” Rio asks quietly, meeting those soft blue eyes that are looking at her with so much endearment it makes Rio’s breath catch.</p><p>Agatha nods and lifts her arms up as Rio gently tugs the fabric up over her head and lets it fall to the floor. She lets her hands settle on Agatha’s ribs, lip pulled between her teeth as she takes her time taking her in, before reaching around and undoing her bra and it joins the sweater on the floor. She watches as Agatha nervously bounces in front of her, the new exposure a lot. Rio can see her fingers twitch at her side, a battle of covering herself or reaching out she’s not sure but she doesn’t let her think about it for long as she steps in and closes the gap.</p><p>“You’re beautiful,” Rio whispers, bringing her hands up to cup her cheeks and pressing a light kiss to her lips. “We can slow down if this is too much.”</p><p>“No, I want this. I want to see you,” Agatha replies, her hands coming up to follow a similar journey under Rio’s shirt and the cool air hits her stomach as it’s pulled up and over her head. “I won’t be responsible for my reaction though.”</p><p>Rio lets out a breathy laugh as gentle fingers tug at her sports bra and it’s tossed to the side. Agatha hums approvingly as she trails her fingers down Rio’s chest, splaying her palm against her stomach and if Rio tenses just for the satisfaction of watching Agatha’s lip twitch into a smirk then who can blame her. It’s good getting to feel wanted, she will never get used to how it feels to be wanted by Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“Can I?” Agatha asks, her hands finding their way to the waistband of her jeans.</p><p>Rio nods, silently regretting the choice of wearing grey boxers that are absolutely already soaked through but she can’t control it. Not when Agatha has looked at her like this all day, not when she has got to hear the way she laughs when she thinks no one else is listening. Getting to see the way she has a certain smile that seems to only be reserved for Rio.</p><p>There is no embarrassment though, only the throaty groan as Agatha tugs her jeans down her thighs and sees the effect she has on Rio. Still there is no rush, just slow hands making a journey up her thighs, back up her sides and resting against her neck as Agatha pulls her back and kisses her until the air is pulled out of her lungs.</p><p>Somehow Agatha’s jeans are off and Rio is pressing her backwards until her thighs meet the mattress, everything blurring perfectly as they land against the sheets, breathy giggles spilling out as mouths meet and hands move. Someone moans, someone sucks in a breath and both of them have the same dumb smile that can’t seem to be wiped off their faces. It repeats like that, time still stopped for them as the light fades into night.</p><p>“Are you real?” Rio whispers, her lips grazing against the stretch marks against Agatha’s hip, her fingers pressing into the other.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers are tangled in her hair, her chest flushed, hair wild against the pillows and she just smiles.</p><p>Rio’s mouth keeps moving, pressing into all the places it hadn’t gotten the pleasure of touching, her chest, her stomach, teeth grazing against a nipple. Fingers pressing into new flesh and finding new sounds she could pull from Agatha’s throat with just the hum of her voice against her skin.</p><p>That’s how it goes, a silent worship of every inch of Agatha’s body with her hands, with her mouth, whispering words that Agatha might not have heard for a long time against her throat, her thighs wherever her mouth meets next.</p><p>
<i>”You deserve this.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>”God you are beautiful.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>”I will never get used to being allowed this.”</i>
</p><p>She doesn’t stop until Agatha is shaking and her chest is heaving, wipes the tear stains from her cheeks without a word, lips trailing back down her chest and hips just in case it didn’t sink in the first twenty times that Rio couldn't get enough of this.</p><p>It’s only when there is a soft tap against her cheek that Rio stills and lets her eyes meet Agatha’s again.</p><p>“I want to touch you,” Agatha asks gently, pulling Rio back up to meet her mouth again. “Can I?”</p><p>How could she ever deny herself that. “<i>Please.</i>”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth is warm and wet and everywhere all at once or at least that’s how it feels as Rio’s nails dig into the sheets. Every drag of her tongue is delicate but precise and Rio’s hips have trouble staying against the mattress, her throat raw from not being able to hide how good it feels to be had like this, to be taken care of too.</p><p>Rio had forgotten that it was supposed to feel like that, forgotten that she didn’t always need to give and give and give. That she could take and that it is okay. The quickness in which her body lets her come undone underneath Agatha is wild but she doesn’t stop, she pulls more from Rio, doesn’t stop until Rio is sure she’s about to meet god himself.</p><p>So much seems to have seeped out from them both, lingering in the quiet spaces that they are not going to reach into just yet. It’s not just about the orgasms or the heat clinging to their skin as they collapse, limbs tangled together, it’s so much more but there isn’t a name for it yet.</p><p>So they don’t try to name it. They just enjoy the quiet, fingers still trailing against skin, hushed whispers of praise and kindness into the dark, not ready to let go just yet.</p><p>It’s late, much later than either realised, hours have passed and yet it felt like minutes and not enough of them.</p><p>There are soft breaths coming from Agatha, Rio realises she’s learning something new, can see the gentle rise and fall of her chest. This is Agatha slipping into sleep, nuzzled into Rio’s neck. She gets to take a minute to just watch and doesn’t want to tear her eyes away. Not yet.</p><p>“You’re staring,” Agatha whispers.</p><p>
<i>Please let me, please keep letting me have this.</i>
</p><p>Rio presses light kisses against Agatha’s cheek, watching as a lazy smile settles on her lips and she fights to keep her eyes open.</p><p>“Come on sweetheart, let's get ready for bed,” Rio whispers before pressing a final kiss against her lips.</p><p>Agatha groans, her lips turning down, hands reaching to pull Rio back into her. “Can’t we just sleep like this.”</p><p>“You don’t even have to move, I will do all the work,” Rio grins, pushing herself off the bed and making her way to the closet.</p><p>“What if I don’t want you to put clothes back on ever again?” Agatha huffs, her eyes lingering on Rio’s ass as she rummages through her drawers. “It will be a hate crime against me personally if you deny my eyes from getting to see you like this.”</p><p>“Whatever will my punishment be?” Rio smirks, crawling back onto the bed and dropping the chosen bed clothes onto Agatha’s chest and laughing as she tries to chuck them across the room. “Arms up baby.”</p><p>Agatha dutifully lifts her arms but not without pouting, letting Rio tug the shirt over her head and down her chest. She realises Agatha is right, it is a hate crime because Rio suddenly regrets her decision as the sight of her naked chest is no longer in front of her. Agatha watches her intently, her features much softer in this light, it’s hard not to stare right back and want to fall back into her. But Rio has committed now and presses gentle kisses to her thighs as she pulls the plaid boxers up and shuffles a stubborn Agatha into them.</p><p>“Cute,” Rio teases, taking in the faded band shirt a size too big and the baggy boxers and thinks she could get used to this, wants to get used to this. “I’m going to brush my teeth, I have a spare if you want to join me.”</p><p>She pulls on a similar combo and makes her way to the bathroom door, turning slightly and finding a sleepy Agatha trailing behind her, looking completely unimpressed. Rio reaches her hand out and tugs her forward, guiding her in and watching as she scrunches her face at the harsh light of the bathroom and Rio can’t help but laugh at how many new sides of Agatha she has gotten to see in less than twenty-four hours. She’s so soft towards Rio, gentle, kind, and patient. But she doesn’t have that same patience for others, very evident in the way she almost made some poor guy shit his pants with a single glare earlier on. To now seeing her angrily scowling at a light bulb for being too bright and watching as the creases fade as Rio presses in behind her and kisses her shoulder as she opens the cabinet and pulls out toothbrushes and hands her one.</p><p>“Suspicious,” Agatha smirks as she runs it under the tap before pulling it to her mouth. “You have a toothbrush in my favourite colour?”</p><p>Rio can feel her cheeks getting warmer, averting her eyes from the mirror and mumbles to the floor. “It was a twin pack.”</p><p>“Oh I am sure,” Agatha grins, tugging her fingers under Rio’s chin and turning her back to look at her. “Thank you.”</p><p>The domesticity of it might be a bit much, Rio wasn’t sure how to do this, all she knows is that she isn’t hiding from a hopeful future and if that starts with a stupid purple toothbrush then so be it. It really was a twin pack.</p><p>She watches Agatha, a loose smile on her lips as she brushes, her eyes half closed, turning her head and Rio realises she is mournful that she has only got one day of seeing her like this, so much time spent chasing a happiness that was never even real when something like this could have been hers all along. She realises that even if it is only one day that she gets that it’s probably the happiest she has ever felt and she knows what is actually worth chasing now.</p><p>Rio doesn’t care that the toothpaste has dripped down her chin, she leans in and kisses Agatha, letting the toothbrush clatter against the sink before pulling her hand up and letting her fingers tangle in Agatha’s hair, tugging gently and she comes willingly her own toothbrush abandoned.</p><p>Agatha hums against her lips, hands coming to settle against Rio’s chest, unfazed by the messiness of it all, just lets Rio thank her with her lips.</p><p>“Shall we go get some sleep?” Rio asks, her lips still lingering.</p><p>“I thought you’d never ask,” Agatha smiles, bringing a towel up to wipe away the last of the toothpaste from Rio’s face before letting her lead them back to the bed. She stands arms crossed as Rio starts to settle into the side further from the door and waits for Rio to look back at her. “That’s the side I sleep on.”</p><p>Rio looks at her dumbfounded. “This is my bed, this is my side.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha smirks.</p><p>“No?” Rio raises her eyebrows, watching as she starts a slow crawl up the bed, her fingers digging into Rio’s side making her cry out. “Hey! That’s not fair.”</p><p>Agatha looks far too pleased at the new discovery and Rio knows it's too late for her and that she is not winning as Agatha flops down in the space she had just occupied. Rio grumbles as she slides further over, half a mind to turn over and pass out to be petty but before the thought has barely formed, Agatha is there, warm lips pressing against Rio’s jaw. The only reasonable thing for Rio to do is lift her arm and let Agatha settle against her chest, on the very side of the bed she claimed to not be able to sleep on.</p><p>It’s safe, warm like it's where they were both supposed to be this whole time.</p><p>“Goodnight handsome,” Agatha whispers into the dark.</p><p>Rio presses her lips to her head, fingers trailing lightly down her arm. “Goodnight sweetheart.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It’s been just over a month since their first official date and Agatha finds herself landing on Rio’s bed more than her own most nights. They do spend time apart, work is busy, Rio has a lot of new builds going on but their nights somehow started being for them and Agatha is more than okay with that. Sleeping without the soft hum of Rio’s breathing just isn’t the same, not that she would ever admit it.</p><p>The light has started to fade, night creeping in far too quickly like it always does when they are together. Agatha feels the dip of the mattress and then cold hands start creeping up the hem of her shirt.</p><p>“Rio!” She warns, squirming away from the contact.</p><p>Rio just laughs, her hands already warming against her skin, her head coming to join Agatha’s against the pillow, pressing a light kiss to her shoulder. “Sorry my love, you know I can’t resist.”</p><p>“No, you just can’t keep heat in and want to steal all mine,” Agatha rolls her eyes as she feels the grin that presses against her neck. “You are lucky I only find you mildly annoying.”</p><p>The fingers under her shirt trace lines against her ribs as Rio hums against her ear. “Last week it was ‘extremely annoying’, does that mean one day you will just find me completely endearing and adorable?”</p><p>“No, you have already gone back up to extremely annoying,” Agatha grins, turning her head and letting Rio press her lips to hers. “I only have a few more emails to sort through and then I’m all yours baby.”</p><p>Rio nods and settles back. This has become a new normal, she could easily pick up her own phone, turn on the TV or anything else but instead she watches, fingers running gently over Agatha’s stomach. The first time Agatha had teased her, asked if she was trying to rush her so she had Agatha all to herself but Rio had said no, said she liked to have the time to appreciate what she has.</p><p>She does that, says things like it is easy and maybe it is but Agatha isn’t there yet, the words still get stuck in her throat but Rio never pushes.</p><p>So now when Rio stares and runs her hands against her all she can think about how lucky she is.</p><p>As she clicks on the last email in the practises inbox, she can’t help the snort that comes out of her, Rio’s hand stills and she leans back in to read over Agatha’s shoulder. “Another one?”</p><p>Agatha nods trying to shake away the laughter before she starts reading.</p><p>
<i>“I have emailed multiple times and have yet to receive a response. My calls never connect and I would like to know my concerns are taken seriously.”</i>
</p><p>Her personal and work number had absolutley been blocked from the call list. This is the fifth email Hela has sent in, not knowing that Agatha deals with all emails that come through the clinic’s main account. Is it unethical for her to delete every single one? Completely. Does she care? Not at all.</p><p>
<i>“It is completely unethical for a therapist to sleep with one of their clients and an abuse of power by Dr Harkness. She is taking advantage of potentially vulnerable clients.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha hears Rio scoff beside her and turns to find her with a lazy smirk on her face, the phone is abandoned, bouncing off the bed as Agatha presses in closer to Rio.</p><p>“Am I abusing my power with you baby?” Agatha pouts, letting her fingers crawl under Rio's shirt, nails biting into her stomach as her lips brush against her jaw. She drops her voice to whisper as she reaches Rio’s ear. “Am I taking advantage of you?”</p><p>Rio’s muscles contract underneath her touch and she tilts her head to the side to give Agatha more access to her neck. “Yes.”</p><p>Agatha smiles against her, fingers making their way to the waistband of Rio shorts. “Do you want me to stop?”</p><p>“Fuck no,” Rio breathes out, reaching to grab Agatha’s wrist, holding her in place.</p><p>Her fingers work through Rio’s untamed hair, nails digging down roughly and she grins against Rio’s jaw when she lets out a pleased groan. “Are you already wet for me my love?”</p><p>Rio sucks in a breath as Agatha’s fingers keep travelling downward, lingering just above where she needs her most, she digs her nails into Agatha’s wrist in an attempt to press her hand down at the same time her hips jut up to meet her there.</p><p>Agatha tuts and gives a sharp bite to her jaw in warning. “I asked you a question.”</p><p>“Fuck, yes. Agatha please,” Rio whines, her hips hovering, desperate for a fraction of friction against her. “So so fucking wet for you.”</p><p>“Good boy, you know I like it when you use your words for me,” Agatha says as she presses her lips against Rio’s cheek and finally brushes the tips of her fingers against Rio’s clit. She watches as her lips part and a quiet gasp hits the air. “Oh sweetheart you weren’t lying huh?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head, pressing herself into Agatha’s touch, she lets her. Watching as she rides against her fingers, face scrunching in concentration as she chases the pleasure, the room fills with slick sounds and soft pants. Agatha keeps watching, whispering quiet encouragements in Rio’s ear as she gets closer and closer to the edge.</p><p>“You look so good like this.”</p><p>“You look even better,” Rio smirks, attempting to turn her head to catch Agatha’s lips with her own but Agatha presses down more firmly at the same time. Rio ends up open mouthed and moaning against her chin. “Oh fuck, don’t stop.”</p><p>“Wasn’t planning on it, unless…” It’s Agatha’s turn to smirk as Rio’s grip tightens so she keeps pressing tight circles against Rio’s clit, embracing the warmth of Rio’s breath against her skin as she pants with every stroke of her fingers.</p><p>Watching Rio like this, seeing her come undone from Agatha’s touch. It’s got to be one of the hottest things she has ever gotten to witness. She chases every touch of Agatha’s fingers, her free hand fisted in the sheets, knuckles turning white. Agatha could never tire of the moans she lets slip free, they spill perfectly against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“So needy, did you miss me today?” Agatha teases.</p><p>“Yes, always miss you,” Rio mumbles through breaths. “Need to come, please can I come?”</p><p>“You have done all the work today, you can come whenever you want,” Agatha whispers against her ear, watching as Rio tilts her head back, her hips grinding faster against her fingers. “Maybe I should reply to that email and say it’s you taking advantage of me.”</p><p>Rio’s moan cuts through the room, Agatha’s lips still pressed against her skin. The warmth of her arousal coats Agatha’s fingers, a satisfied sigh escapes Rio’s lips as her hips settle back against the mattress.</p><p>“Oh you freak, you love the thought of that don’t you?” Agatha laughs, watching the quick rise and fall of Rio’s chest as she comes down.</p><p>“Will you let me take advantage of you Dr Harkness?” Rio cocks her eyebrow as she tilts her head to the side and gives her a hopeful smile.</p><p>“Oh baby, you’d have to tie me down if you think I wouldn’t be taking exactly what I wanted from you,” Agatha purrs.</p><p>Rio grins wide, pulling up onto her elbow and leaning in close. “That can be arranged.”</p><p>“I’d like to see you try,” Agatha laughs against her lips as she finally lets Rio kiss her, feeling the smile pressed against her own as Rio’s free hand comes up to cup her jaw.</p><p>Agatha pulls back, slipping her hand out from Rio’s shorts and bringing her fingers up between them. Before she can wrap her lips around them Rio is already there, tongue out ready.</p><p>“Hm, you want to clean up your mess?”</p><p>Rio nods, opening her mouth wider, moaning as Agatha slides her fingers into her mouth and watches as Rio’s eyes roll back as she presses in as far as she can go.</p><p>“Greedy,” Agatha smirks, she pulls them out and quickly replaces them with her own tongue trying to get a taste for her own pleasure, delighted by how quickly Rio succumbs to her touch yet again as she lets Agatha press her back down against the bed.</p><p>“Who are you referring to?” Rio says as she pulls back, giving her a cocky smile. “You want me so bad.”</p><p>Agatha huffs, pretending to pull away and off the bed only for Rio’s hands to work faster as they fist into her shirt and tug her right back into her, lips pressing right back against her own.</p><p>“I love that you want me.”</p><p>“If I had a dollar for every potentially vulnerable client that said that to me…” Agatha teases, watching as Rio scowls instantly.</p><p>“You better have only one fucking dollar,” Rio pouts.</p><p>Agatha laughs, pressing light kisses against Rio’s lips until her pout turns into a smile. “And yet I feel stupid fucking rich.”</p><p>—</p><p>Fall comes round far too quickly, days feel like seconds to Rio as they reach almost three months of dating, they haven’t called it for what it is yet and Rio is okay with that. She is just grateful for the little moments they get to share when the day winds down and Agatha’s legs are stretched out over her lap.</p><p>Rio still hasn’t got used to how everything changed that morning after their first date. Agatha had stood in her kitchen, Rio’s shirt falling off her shoulder as she blew into a hot cup of coffee, a small smile on her lips as she watched breakfast being served. It was the kind of moment that made you pause and think ‘this is it, this is what I have been waiting for’ and she had absolutely got more in these last three months than she could have ever hoped for.</p><p>Agatha just fit, not just in these walls but with Rio. She makes everything flow just right, long days are nothing when you get to come home to warm hands waiting to wrap you up or take you apart, they are always ready for either. Even when the day has been bad the other is always ready to pick up the pieces and ask ‘do we fix it or do we let it go?’.</p><p>It hasn’t been all sunshine, there have been rocky moments, doubt seeping in during the quiet hours. Agatha whispering into the shadows asking if Rio deserves better. Rio sliding onto the bathroom tiles, knees pulled up asking if she is enough. They are rare but they happen and they have both settled on taking it one step at a time, hushed reassurance being echoed in every room, hands gripping a little tighter under the comforter. Both knowing that the answers will always be ‘no I deserve you, we deserve this’ and ‘yes you are more than enough for me, for this world’.</p><p>It’s from those whispered conversations that Rio has learned Agatha hates her birthday, it was never a celebration to her, to anyone really.</p><p>Everything awful always seemed to happen on her birthday. She opened up to Rio about how when she had agreed to celebrate it after Wanda had begged to let her take her out that she never showed up. She had found out Wanda had been pressed against someone else when Agatha was sitting alone in the restaurant waiting. That was the first time she realised Wanda was never going to be really hers, but still she stayed.</p><p>Rio had listened, holding her in close when the tears soaked into her shirt as she spoke. Listened to her tell her about how everything with her mother came crashing down on her birthday too, how it was just filled with so much dark memories that she couldn’t possibly see ever truly loving it ever again.</p><p>It was a heavy conversation and Rio could see why it was something that was so tainted and broken for her to feel like a celebration when it has only ever been filled with badness. She couldn’t let her have those be the only memories she associated with it, she wanted her to see she could have good things, that she was loved.</p><p>Which is why it was one of those pieces that Rio asked if she could try to fix, she wanted Agatha to celebrate being alive, getting to live the life she has now. Agatha had grumbled but agreed which has led Rio to here now, smile wide on her face as a grouchy Agatha snuggles deeper into the bed, brows furrowed.</p><p>“Happy not birthday beautiful,” Rio whispers, pressing her lips to Agatha’s head.</p><p>“Yay one year closer to the grave,” Agatha grumbles, lips twitching as Rio gasps dramatically. “You could put me out of my misery now if you wanted to give me my dream birthday gift.”</p><p>Rio pokes her in the side, peeling the sheet back so she can bracket Agatha’s hips with her thighs. “No can do baby, we got a lot of fun to be had and my gift is way better than an early death.”</p><p>“What could possibly be better than that?” Agatha asks, bringing her hands up to settle on Rio’s thighs. “If you pull a gift out from somewhere I will kill you and then myself.”</p><p>“I’m glad to know you wouldn’t want to live without me,” Rio grins as she dips her head down, lips lingering just a breath away from Agatha’s. “Come shower with me?”</p><p>Agatha hums, her face lighting up instantly. “Okay now that’s a gift I can get behind.”</p><p>The gift absolutely is not what Agatha assumes, however it does not stop Rio from willingly sinking onto her knees, teeth dragging up the inside of Agatha’s thigh as she digs her nails into Rio’s scalp to keep her held close.</p><p>“You haven’t had breakfast yet, I would assume you would be desperate to have your mouth full,” Agatha prods, attempting to pull Rio into her groaning when Rio doesn’t budge. “It’s my birthday.”</p><p>Rio chuckles against her, looking up through her lashes at the pouting Agatha above her. “Oh so it’s fine for you to use it to get what you want?”</p><p>“Yes, now get to work pretty boy,” Agatha smirks, knowing full well that she has Rio wrapped around her finger and will always get what she wants.</p><p>Plus there would be no enjoyment for Rio if she didn’t get to watch Agatha fall apart above her at any given moment. She loves giving this insane woman anything she asks for and if right now that’s her mouth then she is more than willing.</p><p>However she will be taking her time, savouring the ache in her jaw that she will wear like a badge of honour when she gets to see the glow against Agatha’s cheeks as she looks at her across the room later on.</p><p>“Rio, I swear you are purposely torturing me,” Agatha groans, trying to fight against the hold Rio has on her hips to stop her from taking full control of the moment.</p><p>Rio smiles against her, dragging her teeth over her clit at the same time and watches as Agatha crashes her head back against the tiles dramatically. Rio pulls back, water droplets collecting in her eyelashes as she looks up with a playful pout. “Is the birthday girl feeling too empty?”</p><p>“So empty, need you to fix that,” Agatha replies, running her thumb over Rio’s bottom lip and giving her a pleading smile. “Can you do that for me?”</p><p>“Can you ask nicely?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Fair enough.</p><p>“I’ll beg for your cock later if that helps you get a move on,” Agatha smirks, watching as Rio’s eyes widen and she nods quickly, now desperate to give Agatha as many orgasms as she wants so that ‘later’ comes quicker.</p><p>Some might call Rio pathetic for how quickly she succumbs to those fluttering lashes and that dangerous smile but who can blame her. As her hand leaves Agatha’s hip to do exactly as she is asked, Agatha pulls her bottom lip between her teeth and instantly pushes her hips off the wall and against Rio’s mouth again. She takes full advantage of getting some control back.</p><p>Rio lets her take, flattening her tongue and watching as Agatha slowly starts to grind against it. Listening to the stuttered moans that echo off the glass as she finds the perfect rhythm. She waits a few minutes until Agatha’s arousal is dripping down her chin and mixing with the water beneath her before she brings her hand up and slowly teases two fingers in nice and slow.</p><p>“God yes,” Agatha moans, pressing more firmly into Rio’s face, hips faltering as Rio curls her fingers. “Fuck you’re too good at that.”</p><p>Rio lets a muffled laugh vibrate against her before sucking her clit between her lips and using her free hand to keep Agatha steady as she pumps her fingers at a slow and deep pace. Watching as her jaw slackens and her hips give up, letting Rio finish what she started.</p><p>She gets to watch the most beautiful show as Agatha comes quickly after that, hand going slack and pushing Rio’s head away from her when it gets too much. Rio licks her lips, cheeks flushed from the heat of the water now flowing down her chest.</p><p>Agatha looks down at her, chest still heaving but she smiles wide. “Come here.”</p><p>Rio barely has her bearings as she gets to her feet before her back is flush to the glass and Agatha kisses her. The kind of kiss that says ‘I’m so glad it's you, I’m so glad I got to choose you’ and Rio lets it settle in her chest, hands clinging to Agatha’s hips as she is devoured.</p><p>“Best birthday ever?” Rio asks, watching as it gets an eye roll and a smile in response.</p><p>“You haven’t even fed me yet, don’t get too cocky.”</p><p>“Let me fix that.”</p><p>Agatha sighs but lets Rio jump out the shower leaving her to enjoy the warmth for a few more minutes. She must assume Rio has gone to make them breakfast because the sound of the speaker hits and the soft hum of Reneé Rapp slips through the crack in the door. Rio’s eyes widen and she walks back into the bathroom to make sure she isn’t imagining things but clear as day she finds Agatha singing as she works her fingers through her hair.</p><p>She will absolutley be bringing this up at a later date after the countless times Agatha has complained about Rio playing her music while they cook together.</p><p>Rio walks back out, shaking her head but can’t wipe the smile off her face as she gets ready for the day. She calls out to let Agatha know she is going out to grab breakfast just as the shower shuts off. Agatha none the wiser as she yells out ‘okay baby, be quick.’</p><p>It takes a lot more work than Rio envisioned, however she manages to balance breakfast, coffee and Agatha’s surprise in both hands as she tumbles back through her front door. She sets everything down, peeking her head through the living room door and finds Agatha draped over the sofa. Rio’s sweats sitting low on her waist and washed out band shirt clinging to her chest.</p><p>“Hey handsome,” Agatha gives her a smile before reaching her hands out and motioning for the coffee. “Better be the best coffee in the city, you took forever.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, leaning down to steal a kiss before walking back to grab the rest of their breakfast. She calls out, “I have a surprise for you.”</p><p>Agatha is pressing against her from behind so fast it almost knocks Rio over but she laughs and watches out the corner of her eye as Agatha’s eyes finally settle on the carrier on the floor.</p><p>“Is that?” Agatha gasps, moving to the side and leaning down to get a better look. “Oh my god Rio is this Scratchy from the sanctuary?”</p><p>“They let me borrow him for a few hours, he loves cheesy rom-coms and snuggles,” Rio replies softly, watching the way Agatha’s eyes soften as she looks up at her.</p><p>“I am being overrun by two losers on my birthday,” Agatha groans but the smile plastered on her face tells a completely different story. “I bet he has your terrible taste in music too.”</p><p>Rio gasps, narrowing her eyes. “So you weren’t listening to my playlist in the shower this morning?”</p><p>“I-,” Agatha bites back a smile, turning back to the bunny and lifting him out of the carrier bringing him up to her face and whispering, “I think I’ve been caught Scratchy, gonna need to use you as a distraction.”</p><p>Agatha turns to Rio, the bunny squished to her face and pouts playfully as she walks towards her. “Wanna snuggle with us?”</p><p>“I have been replaced so easily,” Rio crosses her arms but is quickly pulled in and has bunny fur tickling her nose as Agatha presses her lips to her cheek.</p><p>“Thank you baby,” Agatha whispers, letting her free hand linger at Rio’s neck as she looks at her with so much sincerity that Rio could explode with happiness. “This is the best birthday ever.”</p><p>They spend the morning and early afternoon wrapped up in each other. Scratchy mostly nestled on Agatha’s chest, a movie playing on in the background but the rooms mostly filled with their laughter.</p><p>He doesn’t like Rio all too much, thumps his foot on Agatha’s stomach whenever Rio leans in too close. Narrows his little eyes at Rio and twitches his nose like he is gloating about stealing all the attention. Rio won’t admit it but she is extremely jealous and glares at him when Agatha isn’t looking.</p><p>Rio doesn’t want the moment to end, the softness to it all, seeing the way Agatha’s face has been a permanent smile for the last few hours, it’s exactly how she pictured the day going. It’s one of those moments where the words sitting heavy in her chest could slip out so easily but they don’t even feel needed when Agatha finds her across the room gives her a lazy smile as she burrows into Scratchy’s fur, they are being said just not with words. Not yet.</p><p>Rio makes them lunch, humming quietly to her music, when she had last looked into the room she was met with quiet snores, Agatha on her side with the bunny tucked under her arm. She leaves them like that and works away, doesn’t hear the shuffled footsteps approaching, only snapping out of her zone when something brushes against her ankle.</p><p>“FUCK!”</p><p>“Hey, no swearing in front of the baby,” Agatha teases, yawning as she sneaks a look over Rio’s shoulder. “Oh my, pulling all the stops out today huh?”</p><p>Rio, still recovering from the mini heart attack, glares down at the bunny who just twitches his nose and hops across the room. “Of course, you love grilled cheese for lunch,” Rio laughs softly and flips the bread in the pan again.</p><p>They had learned about two weeks into dating that Agatha ate for convenience and not for enjoyment half the time with her busy schedule. So Rio had made an effort to change that. Bringing her lunch whenever she could, handing Agatha ingredients when she sat at the table and telling her how to cut them when Rio insisted on cooking for them. It had started off stressful and Agatha cursed at whatever she was battling with a knife but it slowly became fun, shoulders bumping as they danced around the counters. Agatha stealing a taste when it wasn’t ready yet.</p><p>But today was for her, today was a day for a comfort meal and familiarity. So they ate their grilled cheese with Scratchy bumping against their ankles, Agatha wiping the grease from Rio’s chin and kissing her like nothing else mattered but them.</p><p>The kind of day that makes you grateful and full.</p><p>When it’s time for Rio to take the bunny back Agatha kisses his little nose and cuddles him for a few extra minutes. Rio’s heart threatens to lurch out her chest. However she has a feeling this won’t be the last time she finds those beady little eyes taunting her from across the room.</p><p>As she turns to leave Agatha to get ready for their evening with Alice and Jen, she barely makes it two steps before arms snake round her waist and lips press to her neck.</p><p>“You are the best,” Agatha says softly, holding on a little tighter.</p><p>Rio tilts her head to the side and lets her lips meet Agatha’s for soft peck before she smirks and pulls away. “I know.”</p>

<p>The music thumps into Agatha’s ears as soon as they push the large wooden door to The Coven open. Luckily before Agatha has time to make it Rio’s problem and convince her that they could have more fun at home, Jen spots them both.</p><p>“Oh my god, fucking <i>finally</i>,” Jen yells over to them as they walk towards the booth beside the bar.</p><p>They push their way through the crowd and Agatha is silently incredibly grateful when she already sees two bottles of wine in ice on their table. She turns round to give Rio a reassuring smile, this is the first time they have properly been out with other people as a couple. They’ve gotten so used to their own bubble of happiness but Agatha knew she couldn’t keep avoiding Jen’s demands for a double date. She takes Rio in, her smartest grey pants paired with a white tank, cream shirt and gold chain. Agatha pulls her bottom lip between her teeth, staring at the extremely hard nipples and piercings that taunt her through the tank.</p><p>“Come on baby,” Rio prompts, pulling her out of her daydream as they eventually sit down at the booth. They pass almost-awkward introductions and immediately fall into comfortable conversation within the group.</p><p>Agatha’s almost a bottle of wine deep when Alice asks what Rio does for work. Agatha honestly loves nothing more than listening to how passionate Rio is with her work and what she does to help people. She places a comforting hand onto Rio’s thigh as she reaches for a new wine bottle whilst she talks.</p><p>“...So that’s pretty much what I spend my days doing and then most days I get to come home to Agatha too. It’s the dream life really,” Rio laughs, pulling her beer bottle to her lips.</p><p>Alice smiles. “That’s so fucking cool what? For real though, that is awesome Rio I love that.”</p><p>“What about you? When you’re not booking appointments to fuck your wife in the office what do you get up to?” Rio teases, smirking across the table.</p><p>Agatha worries Rio shouldn’t have said that, unsure if that was meant to stay between her and Jen. But she’s quickly reassured when the pair opposite them burst out into laughter, Jen smacking the table accidentally with how hard she’s laughing.</p><p>“Agatha you motherfucker, I can’t believe you told her that,” Jen finally says.</p><p>All Agatha can do is smirk and tilt her wine glass towards Jen in response. Jen raises an eyebrow, it’s a look that says ‘she’s a keeper’ and Agatha’s heart warms at the interaction.</p><p>Alice eventually gathers her laughter, taking a deep breath before they start speaking. “We actually kind of work in similar fields, I’m an electrician. Nothing overly interesting, just pretty standard electrician nonsense which I gather you know all about.”</p><p>Rio nods back. Agatha is enjoying this interaction way more than she could’ve ever imagined, the way Alice and Rio seem to have gelled with one another, allowing her and Jen to sit in each other’s company in silence both watching their other halves talk about their passions in awe.</p><p>“I love it though,” Alice continues. “Maybe one day we could link up, work wise? I’d love to help out and do some stuff for free for you guys if you ever need it.”</p><p>“Alice that’s- that’s so nice. Luckily we have enough funding to pay our staff properly at no cost to our customers but let me see what I can do and if you’re serious I’m sure I can get you onboard,” Rio offers, her smile wide on her face.</p><p>“Fuck you’d do that? Man that’s so fucking cool, thank you.”</p><p>They fall back into that comfortable small talk again as Agatha and Jen excuse themselves to go to the bathroom.</p><p>They talk over the cubicle walls about how nice it is to see their partners getting on so well and how happy Jen is for Agatha.</p><p>“Damn Agatha, if I knew doing something unethical would have made you this happy, I would’ve encouraged it months ago,” Jen laughs as they wash their hands.</p><p>“Crazy right? It’s so fucking stupid, everything just works with Rio. Everything just feels right,” Agatha replies.</p><p>Jen reaches out to grab Agatha’s hand as they dodge the crowd on the way back to the booth. “I get it, it’s how I’ve always felt with Alice, they just get me.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t have enough time to pick up on the change of pronouns before they’re already sitting back down at the booth, listening back into Rio and Alice’s new topic of conversation.</p><p>“But yeah, I guess it’s more kind of like yeah sure I was born female but I don’t feel attached to that in any way really. It doesn’t mean anything to me in my head really, so then I guess that makes it harder for me to see myself as a woman because I don’t really have any specific attachments to those parts, if that makes sense?”</p><p>Agatha looks to Rio who is watching Alice with great care and concentration, it’s almost like Agatha can see the cogs turning in Rio’s head as Alice talks.</p><p>“It feels really confusing at first but Jen has been so supportive and at the end of the day, I’m just me. And I am so content with that. I prefer they but I also don’t really mind she either! It’s kind of just figuring out what is best for you and not caring what other people think, at the end of the day because you are doing it for you and not them.”</p><p>Rio just blinks. Agatha wonders whether something has just clicked for Rio and wants to know more immediately.</p><p>“Damn you guys got deep fast whilst we were away,” Agatha teases, placing a light kiss to Rio’s cheek. Rio responds by immediately snaking her hand round Agatha’s hips, squeezing her ass lightly.</p><p>“Women take forever in the bathroom,” Alice laughs. “Honestly I’m in and out of there in a minute.”</p><p>“Wanna come to the bar baby?” Agatha suggests, stretching her hand out. “I’m gonna die if I don’t have another glass of wine in my hand in the next minute.”</p><p>Rio takes her hand instantly, offering Jen and Alice a drink but they politely decline. Agatha yanks Rio straight to the bar, attempting to push past the queues of people and straight to the front of the bar.</p><p>The people working at the bar must have noticed that they’ve skipped the queue because every time Agatha tried to order, the server just ignored her and moved on to the next person.</p><p>Rio’s standing extremely close to Agatha from behind, hips pressed flush against Agatha’s ass. Standing shoulder to shoulder with sweaty bodies around them, Rio rests her chin on Agatha’s shoulder whilst they wait.</p><p>Agatha quickly catches on that she is not the only one tipsy as she feels Rio’s bulge grind into her ass slowly from behind. She ignores it for now, still desperate to know more about Rio’s conversation with Alice whilst she was at the toilet.</p><p>Agatha turns her head, attempting to whisper into Rio’s ear so she can hear past the noise of the bar. “I saw your thinking face back there, that something you’ve been thinking about baby?”</p><p>Rio chuckles lightly, her warm breath pressing against Agatha’s cheek. “Well yeah I guess, it’s definitely something to think more on and speak about later.”</p><p>“Mmm or we could speak about it whilst we wait for some damn service around here,” she shouts that last part of her sentence, throwing daggers to the tall blonde pouring cocktails in front of her.</p><p>Rio hands slide down to Agatha’s hips as she presses her hips forward just a little harder this time. Agatha can feel the outline of it almost perfectly and isn’t surprised when she feels the heat begin to pool in her stomach. Rio’s grip is almost bruising, the possessiveness in her slowly coming loose as people brush up against them at the bar.</p><p>“Or we could do something else to pass the time Cariño?” Rio smirks, lightly thrusting her hips behind Agatha.</p><p>The bar is so crowded that no one is paying attention to them, especially not the bar staff after Agatha skipped the queue.</p><p>“Mmmm,” Agatha moans lightly. “Well just know whatever you decide I’m here for it, hot either way.”</p><p>“Fuck you’ve no idea how turned on I get at how supportive you are mi amor, it’s so fucking hot.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t reply, just arches her back into Rio’s touch, pushing her ass out slightly so it meets every single one of Rio’s light thrusts.</p><p>“Agatha, I- fuck my god,” Rio’s breathing becomes sporadic. “God you’d let me fuck you right here wouldn’t you?”</p><p>Agatha pulls her bottom lip between her teeth quickly in an attempt to hide whatever obscene noise she was bound to make at that comment. In response she just nods her head.</p><p>“Words Agatha,” Rio teases. “You’d let me fuck you right here wouldn’t you?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha pants. “But we can’t but I, I didn’t realise how badly I need you right now.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t dignify her with a response, using the hand that isn’t leaning on the bar to begin dragging her through the crowd.</p><p>“Rio what? My wine!” Agatha protests, allowing herself to be pulled away from the crowd of people and towards the bar bathrooms.</p><p>
<i>Oh.</i>
</p><p>Rio pulls them into the double bathroom that sits furthest away in the string of toilets, slamming the door shut and clicking the lock. There is no time wasted as Agatha’s back is pushed up against the wall, the breaths of desperation growing louder between them. Rio leans in, brushing her lips lightly against Agatha’s. “God I could never have dreamed of having a partner that allows me to explore something like this,” Rio breathes against her, before her tongue begs for entrance.</p><p>Agatha is more than happy to oblige, allowing Rio’s tongue to swipe along her bottom lip before entering.</p><p>Rio pulls back. “I’ll never be able to tell you, never be able to put into words how grateful I am for you.”</p><p>Agatha smirks. “Well. You could start by showing me pretty boy? You aren’t packing for no reason are you, I could feel the desperation in the way you were pressing up against me at the bar.”</p><p>This is something Agatha adores about Rio, even though it is extremely clear exactly what is going to happen between them right now, the way Rio’s eyes darken at the very suggestion of it makes Agatha’s legs weak.</p><p>Rio nods back at her desperately, eager to get her hands on Agatha properly, their lips push together with a kiss that’s almost bruising. Rio moves fast, pulling the knit sweater over Agatha’s head before allowing her hands to make a slow and gentle path down her sides to grab onto her hips. Rio always takes her time, cherishes what she’s looking at, who she’s holding and Agatha loves it. But right now she needs it rougher than that, wants Rio to <i>fuck</i> her.</p><p>“Rio, can you do something for me?” Agatha pants, pulling back breathlessly from the kiss.</p><p>“Anything,” Rio replies instantly, her eyes lighting up <i>again</i> at the thought of being able to do something for Agatha.</p><p>“Take me, give me this however you want. I want it rough baby, give me your all,” Agatha pleads, the grip slowly tightening on her hips.</p><p>Rio groans, that dark glint in her eye taking over again. “Yeah? You sure?”</p><p>“More than anything, give me it. Use me.”</p><p>And that clicks something within Rio. Her rough hands guide Agatha back instantly, her ass hitting the sink taking her by surprise. Rio's lips begin to trail down the side of Agatha’s neck, lightly nipping at the side as Rio’s hands stay firmly on her hips.</p><p>“<i>Fuck,</i>” Agatha moans into Rio’s touch.</p><p>Rio pulls back, reaching for the zipper on her own trousers. “Okay mi hermosa, show me how badly you want this. On your knees querida.”</p><p>Agatha is already caught off guard, remembering how easily Rio slips into her mother tongue when she’s been drinking. Thankfully Agatha lived abroad for two years when she was studying so has a pretty good understanding of what Rio says to her.</p><p>“Now Agatha. Knees.”</p><p>Fuck. Okay no messing about got it, she pushes herself off the sink and instantly drops her knees onto the cold tile.</p><p>“Bra off baby, let me see you.”</p><p>Agatha complies, unclipping the white lace at her back and letting it fall off her shoulders. More often than not their sex is soft at the moment but when they do it rough? God it sends them both reeling. Agatha loves to test Rio’s patience, the bratty side of her often coming out easily but on this occasion she wants to do nothing more than comply. To let Rio have her however she wants in this cramped bathroom.</p><p>“Te ves tan bien así, mi amor, lista para meterlo entero en tu boca,” Rio mutters, looking Agatha directly in the eyes. <i>You look so good like this, my love, ready to take it all in your mouth.</i></p><p>The full blown Spanish takes her by surprise, pulling a moan from her throat as she reaches towards Rio’s cock, realising it’s the first time she’s chosen to pack with the bigger strap.</p><p>“Fuck,” she mutters, stroking the length with her hand.</p><p>“Voy a follarme esa boquita tuya hasta que apenas puedas hablar mañana, ¿crees que podrás tragártela toda?” Rio demands, watching as Agatha’s brain tries hard to process the words quickly. <i>I’m going to fuck that little mouth of yours until you can barely talk tomorrow, do you think you’ll be able to take it all?</i></p><p>Agatha nods rapidly, saliva pooling in her mouth. Ready to do exactly as she’s told. Right now she would do anything for Rio, anything to see her happy and satisfied and if this is how that’s gonna happen? Agatha will happily begin celebrating her birthdays again.</p><p>“Abre bien la boquita,” Rio moans softly, leaning forward and resting the tip on Agatha’s tongue. <i>Open your pretty little mouth wide.</i></p><p>God if Rio keeps talking to her like this she’s gonna come in her underwear untouched.</p><p>Rio wastes no time in filling Agatha’s mouth causing Agatha’s hands to snap out and reach for her thighs, holding Rio close. Agatha watches through her lashes as Rio’s head rolls back. She knows exactly how Rio likes getting her dicked sucked when she holds control, when they do it rougher. So she is going to do exactly that, but more.</p><p>She grips Rio’s thighs as Rio continues to thrust harshly into her, she lets the gags rip from her throat, tears already threatening to spill down her cheeks.</p><p>Rio thrusts harshly, touching the back of Agatha’s throat almost every single time. The overwhelming sounds of moans and gags filling the cramped space.</p><p>“Mirate, que linda te ves con mi polla en la boca… te encanta, ¿verdad?” Rio grunts, picking up the pace. <i>Look at you, how pretty you look with my cock in your mouth… you love it, don’t you?</i></p><p>Agatha moans, finally letting the tears slip down her cheeks as she continues to let her mouth be used.</p><p>“Oh, eres tan bonita cuando lloras por mi,” Rio softly says, using a hand to stroke the tears off her cheek. <i>You’re so pretty when you cry for me.</i></p><p>This may be the closest Agatha has ever been to coming untouched, Rio’s confidence and control mixed with the Spanish is going to send her spiralling over the edge. Rio doesn’t look any more put together, her shirt now discarded somewhere beside Agatha’s jumper as beads of sweat form on her forehead.</p><p>Rio begins to pull out, Agatha instantly feeling the loss in her throat. She decides to see if there’s any control left for the taking and pulls Rio back deep into her by the thighs.</p><p>“Mierda, mira qué ansiosa está hoy,” Rio stutters, attempting to pick the pace back up. <i>Shit, someone’s insatiable today.</i></p><p>Agatha watches through blurry eyes, and can feel as Rio’s hips start to slacken, her thrusts becoming more sporadic as she gets close. Just as Agatha expects, Rio is going to come untouched, it’s one of her favourite things that happens when they fuck. Seeing the growth of the person that came untouched leaning against her door three months ago to the person who enjoys it happening now? Such a turn on.</p><p>The sight only fuels Agatha, Rio’s eyes rolling back as she climbs closer to the inevitable using the feeling to grip Agatha’s hair tighter in her hand.</p><p>She watches as Rio clenches her eyes tight, muttering Spanish that Agatha can’t make out under her breath. Agatha digs her fingers in harder to her thighs, a silent beg for Rio to let go for her. She gets to watch as Rio’s jaw slackens and silent scream seems to rip up her throat as she falls over the edge. The strap pressing deep in Agatha's throat as her hips start to stutter and her knees threaten to buckle.</p><p>The Spanish is driving Agatha insane as she rubs against the heel of her boots, desperate to gain some form of friction and fast.</p><p>“¿Quién te dijo que podías hacer eso?” Rio grunts. Pulling Agatha’s mouth off her cock. <i>Did I say you could do that?</i>,</p><p>Agatha shakes her head in response.</p><p>“Get up mi vida, clearly so desperate to be filled aren’t you?”</p><p>Agatha stands, beginning to push her skirt down her hips.</p><p>Rio grips Agatha’s wrists in response. “No, te quites eso.. Ahora date la vuelta .”</p><p>
<i>No, don’t take that off. Now turn around.</i>
</p><p>Agatha complies, turning to face the mirror and placing her hands on the sink. She watches Rio’s reflection in the mirror as she runs her hands over the curve of her ass.</p><p>“Déjame mi,” Rio says, tone softer. <i>Allow me.</i></p><p>“Baby please, I need you,” Agatha whines as Rio pushes the skirt over her hips, wasting no time and ripping her tights with her hands. “Fuck, Rio.”</p><p>Rio moans as she pushes Agatha’s underwear to the side. “Estás tan lista para mi, mírate tan mojadita” <i>You’re so ready for me, look how wet you are.</i></p><p>Agatha grinds back instantly, desperate to feel the silicone inside of her, desperate to <i>feel Rio inside of her.</i></p><p>“Pídelo bien,” Rio grunts, swiping the tip along Agatha’s wet folds. <i>Ask nicely.</i></p><p>“Please, please I need you baby, please.”</p><p>Rio moans, eventually giving Agatha exactly what she wants. The bathroom suddenly feels a lot smaller as Rio’s stomach presses against her ass, filling her entirely instantly.</p><p>“Shit,” Agatha mutters, dropping her head down towards the sink and reaching for her clit.</p><p>Her actions are quickly cut off by a sharp yank to her hair, causing her neck to snap up as a strangled moan tears loudly from her throat at the sensation.</p><p>“Ojos arriba mi amor,” Rio says, tightening the grip in Agatha’s hair as she thrusts back. <i>Eyes up my love.</i></p><p>Agatha does as she’s told and snaps her eyes up to the mirror, watching as Rio begins to thrust in and out of her, the pace is rough as she rolls her eyes back at the overwhelming sensation. Her mouth drops, suddenly dry and unable to make any noise even if she tries.</p><p>“So good for me aren’t you?” Rio moans, the English slipping back in.</p><p>It isn’t gentle, it’s messy. It’s perfectly desperate, the way Agatha’s body will take anything Rio gives it and will continue to beg for more. It’s everything Agatha needed right now.</p><p>She feels her head begin to spin, whether it’s the wine catching up with her or the fact she has been on the edge of an orgasm for the past fifteen minutes. She isn’t sure but she needs it now. She continues to watch as Rio grips her hair and forces her to look in the mirror, her elbows resting against the sink attempting to stay balanced.</p><p>“Fuck, I-” Agatha stutters.</p><p>“Need to come baby?” Rio responds, snaking her spare hand round to Agatha’s clit. “God Agatha I can feel you clenching around me, estas llorando para mi aqui abajo también.”</p><p>
<i>Your cunt cries for me too.</i>
</p><p>Rio’s right. Her cunt clenches around Rio’s cock perfectly, desperate to take everything Rio’s got.</p><p>“Let me see it, mi alma. I wanna see you come for me,” Rio says softly, still continuing with the bruising pace of thrusts.</p><p>And that permission is all she needs, her orgasm floods through her as the grip in her hair is let loose allowing her body to collapse into the feeling. Rio works her through it perfectly, chanting words of praise and encouragement from above her.</p><p>“Lo hiciste muy bien.” <i>You’re doing so good for me. </i>.</p><p>“No te contengas, córrete para mí mi amor.” <i>Let go for me, my love.</i></p><p>“Esa es mi chica, eres tan hermosa.” <i>That’s my girl, you’re so beautiful.</i></p><p>Eventually Rio pulls out slowly, reaching out to pull Agatha back into her arms. “God you’re so perfect,” Rio moans, slowly pushing Agatha back onto her knees.</p><p>“Now do one more thing for me and clean up your mess, suck my cock so I can come down your throat properly cariño.”</p><p>Agatha gasps in delight at the instruction barely over her own orgasm before she has Rio’s cock in her mouth again. She reaches out for Rio’s hips, but Rio moves quickly and pulls a hand into her own boxers. Agatha can’t help but smirk at the amount of wetness sitting within Rio’s boxers and suddenly becomes aware that Rio has had multiple orgasms throughout this ordeal.</p><p>Hot.</p><p>Agatha pinches Rio’s clit between her fingers, the angle is incredibly awkward but after the way Rio just fucked her? She’s willing to make it work. She matches the rhythm of her head to the one she provides Rio’s clit, jacking it off just as Rio silently asked.</p><p>“Fuck baby, my god. You’re insane, you were made for my cock weren’t you?” Rio moans, the words that leave her mouth are croaky as she stumbles towards the edge again.</p><p>“Gonna swallow it all when I come in your mouth aren’t you?”</p><p>Agatha gags in response, her mouth far too busy to speak.</p><p>“God you wouldn’t waste a drop would you? I love that you let me be like this, <i>fuck.</i>”</p><p>Agatha pushes her mouth as far as she can take it, letting her nose brush against Rio’s happy trail; she's still growing it out. She looks up to Rio, those brown eyes meeting blue once again and Rio trembles. Her legs shake, her thrusts become sporadic as she comes. It’s exactly what Rio wanted and although she isn’t actually coming down her throat Agatha swears she can feel it running down.</p><p>Eventually Agatha pulls back, she mock swallows before sticking her tongue out flat to Rio.</p><p>“You are fucking perfect, insane even and all completely mine,” Rio pants, reaching out a hand to help Agatha back to her feet.</p><p>Agatha feels the unsaid words settling between them again as Rio looks deep into her eyes, again words to be said but no need to say them.</p><p>Her head spins as she falls back into Rio’s hold. “Fuck that was, everything.”</p><p>She looks at her apple watch realising that they had been gone from Jen and Alice a <i>lot</i> longer than ‘there was a queue at the bar’ would excuse.</p><p>They quickly clean themselves up and despite the rush of it all, Rio still takes care of Agatha, using a damp paper towel to clean up her legs as she sits on the toilet. Despite the mess it’s raw, it’s <i>them</i>. No one has ever cared for Agatha the way Rio does.</p><p>“You okay cariño? Ready to go back?” Rio says, grabbing Agatha’s hand and unlocking the door.</p><p>Agatha holds on tightly, squeezing it a few times for reassurance. Neither of them are prepared for the queue of people they have to walk past when they leave the cubicle, they keep their heads down as they giggle, weaving their way back through the crowds to their friends.</p><p>They reach the booth which is now empty, the server who is cleaning the table turning round to hand them a note.</p><p>
<i>Once you guys had been gone for longer than ten minutes we realised it wasn’t just a ‘trip to the bar’ so we’ve gone home to do the same thing. Get home safe- J x</i>
</p><p>Then at the bottom of the note there was another line scribbled in messy handwriting.</p><p>
<i>Keep it wrapped, have safe sex whores- A.</i>
</p><p>Their laughter continues as they make their way outside, the cold air hitting them both with a reminder of how drunk they actually are. Rio flags them down a cab and Agatha doesn’t quite remember the ride but before she knows it she’s kissing Rio again, hands wandering as the driver shouts at them to get out of the cab because they’ve arrived.</p><p>Rio grabs them two bottles of water and advil before they head upstairs and as soon as Agatha’s head hits the pillow she is out like a light with no water or advil consumed. The wine hangover she is going to experience in the morning, may truly be the end of her but after all that happened tonight? More than worth it.</p><p>—-</p><p>Rio perches on her elbow, the soft morning light has started to creep in through the cracks in the curtains. She takes in the soft curve of Agatha’s nose, the tiny cracks in her lips from a night of too much wine and the steady rise and fall of her chest as she lies hair a tangled mess against the pillow. Her mind floods with thoughts of the night before, how good Agatha looked on her knees, in the mirror and under the crappy lighting of the bar.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful,” Rio whispers into the quiet of the room, her fingers aching to reach out and touch.</p><p>She has been blessed to get these moments, always waking up first when she can, not ashamed to admit she does it just to get a few minutes to be thankful.</p><p>Agatha stirs as Rio’s hand grazes against her chest, palm flat against her heart just to make sure it’s real. It always is but she just likes to be sure.</p><p>“Remind me why you let me drink so much wine,” Agatha says groggily, throat clearly feeling a bit raw from last night, her hands coming up to shield her eyes from the light.</p><p>Rio chuckles. “Oh so this is my fault?”</p><p>“You didn’t stop me.”</p><p>“As if I could stop you from doing anything,” Rio grins, pressing in closer. “Did you have fun?”</p><p>“You have absolutely killed me, I can feel every bone in my body screaming at me,” Agatha huffs.</p><p>“I think that’s just your age.”</p><p>Rio barely dodges the pillow that is meant for her head. They laugh until Agatha groans long and dramatically, ushering Rio to go fetch them breakfast and lots and lots of coffee.</p><p>Just as Rio is about to step out the room Agatha calls out, “Despite the amount of wine I consumed last night, I haven’t forgotten our conversation at the bar. I would love it if you felt comfortable enough to tell me what you are thinking in more detail today. If you are ready.”</p><p>Rio nods, giving her a soft smile before making her way out.</p><p>She doesn’t really know how to put into words exactly how she is feeling, can’t really name what clicked last night when she found out Alice felt so comfortable using ‘she/they’ pronouns. Rio had only ever seen negativity online about the idea of identifying differently to the way you looked to other people. If she is being honest she always held some embarrassment about the way she has felt. Not because she felt like it is something to be ashamed of, but because having to explain herself to people just filled her with so much dread that she wanted to avoid it as much as possible. So she never let it come to the surface, never felt confident enough to say ‘fuck it, fuck what people think’. But now? After seeing Alice so unbothered, it has her thinking it might be something she actually wants to explore. Does that scare her? Kind of. But knowing she now has this safe, kind and loving support behind her it doesn’t seem all that terrifying.</p><p>With breakfast and coffee secured she steps back in to find Agatha still slumped in bed, the sheet wrapped around her. Even after a long night of too much alcohol and not enough sleep she still manages to look stunning.</p><p>“Don’t look at me like that,” Agatha groans.</p><p>“Like what?” Rio smirks as she kneels onto the bed and presses her lips to Agatha’s nose, then her lips.</p><p>“Like you want me even when I look like hell.”</p><p>“You have no idea,” Rio bites her lip playfully before settling in next to her, running her nose over her jaw and grinning. “Maybe a bath first won’t hurt.”</p><p>Agatha pushes her away, steals the paper bag from her grasp but can’t stop herself from leaning back in to give her one last kiss before she eats.</p><p>Shortly after the food is devoured, the coffee cups drained and the sun sits high in the sky, Rio finds herself with Agatha’s back settled against her chest. The warm water rocks against her thighs as she traces light circles against Agatha’s side, she lets out pleased hums occasionally but otherwise they are enjoying the quiet. The water soothing out the tightness in their muscles, the speaker playing softly in the background.</p><p>“So,” Agatha says softly, breaking the silence and tilting her head to the side to make sure Rio is paying attention. Like she could ever lose focus on Agatha. “Now or later?”</p><p>Rio lets out a long breath. “Now is good.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers settle on her knee, warm and encouraging strokes of her thumb while she waits patiently for Rio to talk.</p><p>“I-, what Alice said last night about gender detachment and how they explained it really hit something in me,” Rio starts, tucking her chin on Agatha’s shoulder. “I guess I have thought about my identity more than I realised even before our sessions, maybe even before Hela. However I didn’t really ever give myself the space to really understand it or explore it.”</p><p>“Are you in a new headspace where that could be something you want to do now?” Agatha asks gently.</p><p>“I think maybe?” Rio replies. “I have never felt so supported, so heard or encouraged like I have in these last few months. With you, with the people around me, with myself. I think it is something I can’t stop myself from exploring out of fear of judgement or not knowing if it is even me or not. I think that’s the point, right? Like there is room to try it out and see what works and what doesn’t. Then at the end of the day even if I realise that I’m actually content as I am, then I still let myself figure it out in the ways that work for me.”</p><p>“Exactly baby, you get to decide how you want the world to see you. If that's as you are now, as Rio who identifies as non-binary or as Rio who is still learning, it doesn’t matter because at the end of the day you are still you. And that is all that matters,” Agatha states, the smile clear even though Rio can’t see her. “So you lead this my love, you tell me what you want to try, what you are comfortable with, what you aren’t and I will support you through all of it.”</p><p>Rio’s hands grip a little tighter, her chest feels like it’s about to crack from the overwhelming feeling of love that is building and wrapping around every bone in her body. She should always expect Agatha to be supportive, should have known she had nothing to worry about but still it’s going to take a long time for her to really get used to this. After so long of only quiet resentment building, the thought of this kind of love and care still feels so surreal.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio sighs contently against her ear, holding her closer, the water starting to cool against their skin. “How about I try out ‘she/they’ pronouns for a bit?”</p><p>“Hot,” Agatha smirks, tilting back to press her mouth to Rio’s chin. “Any preference on which you would like me to use more often?”</p><p>“Maybe they/them to see how it feels?” Rio says, still a little unsure.</p><p>“Okay handsome. You just tell me if anything changes,” Agatha smiles.</p><p>They sit like that for a while, until the water is too cold and the need to crawl back under the sheets together comes. Rio doesn’t think it will change much about how they feel or how Agatha will treat them but still the euphoria they feel at getting to be so open is unmatched.</p>

<p>The months move fast and soon fall turns to winter, colourful trees turn to frosted branches yet not much changes between Agatha and Rio. Well until it does.</p><p>Agatha finds herself wide awake at seven in the morning, staring at the pile of gifts on Rio’s kitchen island. She’s never normally awake before Rio but she couldn’t sleep with the anxiety of whether she’d bought them enough or whether they would even like what she’d chosen. She had never felt so excited picking out gifts before and is determined to give Rio a birthday to remember.</p><p>Just like Agatha, Rio is close to resenting birthdays having spent the past few years putting on a show for Hela. Playing dress up and going on stupid dates to stupid fancy restaurants, Agatha would never expect Rio to spend their day like that. So she’d tried something different.</p><p>“What are you doing, come back to sleep baby.”</p><p>A sleepy voice comes from behind her, jolting her out of her thoughts.</p><p>“Hey birthday guy, I’m too awake to come back to sleep,” Agatha laughs softly, turning round to look at Rio who leans against the doorframe in their snoopy sleep shirt and blue boxer shorts.</p><p>“You’ve been gone so long,” Rio whines as their feet plod against the tiles so they can hug Agatha.</p><p>They fold into Agatha’s arms and she swears she can almost hear them snoring against her. “Happy birthday baby, there’s coffee on the table.”</p><p>Once Rio sips their coffee and comes to terms with the fact that they are not going back to bed, they eventually spot the gifts on the table with the balloons dotted around the kitchen.</p><p>“For me?” Rio grins sleepily.</p><p>“For you, wanna open them?” Agatha prompts.</p><p>“Mhm I do, sit beside me?”</p><p>So Agatha does, sitting beside them on the island stool as they watch Rio nearly burst with excitement over the gifts Agatha picked out. Rio tears up at almost every single thing, the amount of thought and care clearly overwhelms them.</p><p>They open the first gift like an excited child on Christmas, tearing the wrapping paper and tossing it to the ground.</p><p>“You remembered?” Rio gasps, reaching for their phone and swapping the case out instantly.</p><p>Agatha can’t help but smile, of course she remembered. “I ordered it straight away dumbass, look how cute the snoopy is too, he is just like you.”</p><p>Rio grins widely, holding the phone up beside their face attempting to mirror the pose snoopy is doing on the case.</p><p>The next gift is just as exciting to Rio. There’s a Jurassic Park exhibit coming to the centre in the city so Agatha bought tickets for the opening night, Rio nearly cries.</p><p>“My god and I thought I was the dramatic half of us,” Agatha teases.</p><p>“Agatha no one gets me like you, no one has ever given me the freedom to enjoy the things I do so openly the way you do,” they sniff, reaching for the next gift. “God this is so fucking cool omg.”</p><p>“Yeah I gathered you could do with an upgrade, this chain is made of better material so should stop making your neck turn green every time you wear it.”</p><p>“God I love it, it’s perfect, you’re perfect,” Rio sighs contently, leaving over to brush their lips against Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha feels warm inside, like this is confirmation that everything she’s been doing has been worth it. That she really did <i>know</i> Rio, that she lov-</p><p>“FUCKING DINO SHEETS WHAT THE HELL!” Rio suddenly exclaims, standing up from the bar stool and unfolding the sheets. “So fucking cool babe.”</p><p>“Well I was pretty disappointed when you promised that I could see your dinosaur sheets that first night and then you didn’t have any, so I got you them myself,” Agatha offers nonchalantly.</p><p>Rio folds the sheet out fully, face beaming back at Agatha.</p><p>“Oh but don’t think for one fucking second I’m letting you fuck me on those sheets, you can change them for the nights I spend here,” Agatha states firmly but still with that teasing edge in her voice she saves completely for Rio.</p><p>“But we can put them on today right?” Rio grins.</p><p>“We can but then no birthday sex, your choice handsome.”</p><p>“Birthday sex <i>and</i> dino sheets, just you wait and see.”</p><p>Rio finishes off their coffee before running upstairs to change the bedding and Agatha is extremely grateful that she had already washed them because she knew they were going to want to put them straight on the bed.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio can’t stop the smile on their face as they change the sheets, sure it is absolutely ridiculous to have dinosaur sheets on their bed at the ripe old age of twenty eight but they couldn’t be happier with it.</p><p>The fact Agatha had remembered the silly small things Rio had joked about weeks ago like the phone case or spending all that money on a decent chain for them. They felt so fucking seen.</p><p>“I’ve got one more gift for you before we start doing work, if you want it?” Agatha peers round the door, holding out a medium sized black gift bag.</p><p>Rio blinks back at her. “Agatha, you've given me so much, and there’s more? I’m so lucky.”</p><p>Agatha walks into the bedroom, sitting herself down on the edge of the bed before encouraging Rio to sit beside her.</p><p>“Look if you hate it or if you’re unsure I can stick it in a drawer and we never have to look at it ever again, but you left your laptop open on the couch a couple of weeks ago and I figured you were probably never going to buy the stuff for yourself and I guess I just got ahead of myself and I-”</p><p>“Hey you don’t have to explain yourself, let me see baby.”</p><p>Agatha hands the bag over, watching closely as Rio begins taking the items out. Three rolls of chest tape, guards, oil with a black binder and a white one too. Rio’s heart pounds, threatening to burst right out of their chest. They lay the items out in front of them, unable to look Agatha in the eye whilst they collect their thoughts.</p><p>“Fuck I went too far didn’t I?” Agatha panics, reaching out a hand and placing it onto Rio’s thigh.</p><p>“God no, Agatha I-,” Rio sniffs. “This is, fuck this is everything. You’re right, I probably never would’ve bought them for myself but you taking that step for me and showing me that it’s okay to want this might just give me the boost I needed to do it.”</p><p>Rio meets Agatha’s eyes, and can see the weight lifting off her shoulders as Rio talks to her.</p><p>“Well there’s no pressure, at least now it’s there when you’re ready for it.”</p><p>This is the kind of love they talk about in movies, the kind that wraps itself around you and plants roots so deep that no matter what storm tries to pass through they won’t budge. The kind of love that people would wish for at fountains and day dream about as they weave through crowded places. But Rio had never wished for it, never daydreamed or written it down in hopes of finding it. Honestly, Rio never thought that kind of love was made for someone like them. Truly believed that life would hand them what it thought they deserved and they would have to make it work. How wrong they were. Now they realise what love is supposed to look like, how it's supposed to feel and they have gotten lucky, so ridiculously lucky that their chest threatens to crack with how much it aches with this feeling of pure love.</p><p>And at that moment Rio almost says it, those stupid three words that have been hanging over them for months. Because Rio feels it, they are completely in love with Agatha Harkness.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha doesn’t live with Rio <i>officially</i>, but somehow slowly but surely their laundry piles have merged and Agatha currently is standing folding it all whilst Rio works at their kitchen table. Rio has an important report to submit by mid-day and has made Agatha promise not to mention it being their birthday again until it is submitted.</p><p>Never in her forty one years of life did she expect to be folding snoopy and dinosaur boxers and enjoying it, but here she is.</p><p>“...Rio oh my god how many of these do you own?” Agatha laughs holding up the pair that have dinosaurs with construction hats on them.</p><p>Rio looks up from their laptop, the stupid grin that Agatha loves so badly plastering their face. “You keep buying me them, this is your fault. I made a dinosaur bedsheet joke once and here we are.”</p><p>“You love it though,” Agatha smirks.</p><p>“Oh very much so mi amor.”</p><p>“Never ever at the age of forty one did I expect to have such a loser lesbian boyfriend but I guess that’s my life now.”</p><p>Rio just continues to grin back at her, smile wider than Agatha thinks she’s ever seen it.</p><p>“I’m not updating my facebook status if that’s what you’re smiling about here,” Agatha replies, laughing at the look on Rio’s face.</p><p>Rio groans. “Oh my god Agatha you still use facebook?”</p><p>“Shut up and finish your report so we can celebrate,” Agatha laughs, throwing a pair of Rio’s boxers towards their head.</p><p>“Wait,” Rio gasps, jumping from the seat and making their way to where Agatha leans against the counter. “Does that mean you, Agatha Harkness, are my girlfriend?” Their tone is teasing and ridiculous as they pull Agatha away from her task.</p><p>Agatha scoffs, leaning her elbows on the counter and raises an eyebrow as Rio dips their head down and presses their hands to her cheeks. “I am forty-one Rio, I am too old to be anyone’s ‘girlfriend’.”</p><p>“Nope,” Rio grins like they have just won the lottery. “Admit it, you are absolutely my girlfriend.”</p><p>“Absolutley not,” Agatha groans, fighting the urge to smile back. Rio has the ability to make you want to smile just by being in the same room as you. “If you ever call me your partner I will get violent, that's so much worse.”</p><p>“Touchy subject,” Rio teases, pressing their stupid grinning mouth to Agatha’s and making her melt right into it. “What if I say it but only when you aren’t in the room?”</p><p>“Hm,” Agath mumbles, bringing her hands up to linger against Rio’s waist. “Fine but only so no one thinks they can hit on you.”</p><p>Rio chuckles, pressing light kisses wherever they can against Agatha’s face before pulling back. “I have a GIRLFRIEND!”</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha warns, pushing them back towards their laptop, watching as they do a stupid fucking victory dance before sitting back down, making her regret starting this whole conversation.</p><p>After another hour Rio finally finishes the report and is dressed and bouncing on their heels as they wait impatiently for Agatha to finish. She has planned a simple day out for them both, something she thinks Rio will love but is still a bit nervous that it’s not enough.</p><p>It’s a bit of a drive but as they pull into the carpark Agatha gets to watch as Rio’s eyes light up as they take in their surroundings. The greenhouse is much bigger than she realised, the glass walls seem to tower above them and Rio looks like they might explode from excitement in the seat next to her.</p><p>“You never mentioned you had been before,” Agatha says softly. “I thought you might like to spend the day educating me.”</p><p>Rio grins and nods excitedly, bringing their hands up and cupping Agatha’s cheeks before kissing her. “God, how’d I get so lucky.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, letting out a muffled laugh but any nerves she had been feeling are long gone. “The plants aren’t going to tell me all their interesting facts themselves now are they?”</p><p>“They might if you listen hard enough,” Rio shrugs, letting Agatha go, rushing out the car and round to open the door for her.</p><p>Their hands naturally intertwine as they walk towards the entrance, Rio bumps against her side as they walk. Agatha loves getting to see them like this, the smile not once slipping from their face.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio hasn’t felt excitement like this in a long time, the chance to speak about something they are so passionate about to someone who genuinely cares and wants to listen, they can’t remember a time before Agatha when they ever had the opportunity to do that.</p><p>They pay at the reception desk before making their way through the big glass doors hand in hand. Rio immediately spots the first plant, laughing to themselves as they drag Agatha over to it.</p><p>“Well would you look at that,” they tease whilst bumping Agatha with their shoulder. “You already know this one!”</p><p>Agatha hums, doing her best to entertain Rio’s excitement. “Snake plant right?”</p><p>“Hell yeah, just like the ones in your office.”</p><p>Since Rio had gifted Agatha that first plant for her office, they had accidentally turned her office into its very own greenhouse with many ‘easy not to kill’ plants.</p><p>“Water it every two to three weeks, avoid direct sunlight, re-pot when required and basic care to keep them happy, right?” Agatha says, turning to look directly at Rio.</p><p>Rio’s eyes well. “Wait, you remembered?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs like it’s nothing. “Of course I did, it’s hard not to when you’re turning my office into its own greenhouse.”</p><p>But Rio sees past the light hearted comment for what Agatha is really trying to say. <i>Of course I remember, you gave it to me and I- </i> then those three words that always hang so heavy between them, neither wanting to say them too soon and risk pushing the other away.</p><p>Even though Rio feels it, the doubt still slips through. Is Rio worthy of Agatha’s love? Is Rio’s love enough for Agatha? It creeps in during those moments but Agatha reassures them often enough that Rio is enough. For this world and for her, they are more than enough.</p><p>They continue through the greenhouse for the next hour, Rio trying to keep their plant descriptions short and sweet so they don’t bore Agatha but occasionally Agatha prompts them to keep speaking or asks them a question. Rio can’t believe their luck, can’t believe what they spent all those years missing.</p><p>As they both make their way into the final section, still hand in hand, Agatha turns to Rio telling them to stand beside the huge tree in the corner so she can take their picture on her polaroid.</p><p>“Or, we could take one together?” Rio asks, walking back towards Agatha. “Here let me.”</p><p>They don’t have a lot of pictures together, so many of each other but less of the two of them together. They try their hardest to stay off their phones when they’re not working, staying present in the moment with the other is something that they’ve both learned they really value after their past relationships.</p><p>Rio holds the camera out in front of them both as Agatha slings her arms round their shoulders. They can’t help but think of how lucky they are yet again, the way Agatha’s smile lights up the entire picture and Rio can’t help but stare at her in awe.</p><p>“Hey look at the camera, not me baby.”</p><p>So Rio does, flashing their tooth gapped smile as Agatha squishes her face right up next to Rio’s as they click the button.</p><p>“There we go, so much better than just me in the picture,” Rio states, holding the polaroid against their chest as they wait for it to develop.</p><p>Once it’s ready, Rio pulls it away from their chest showing it to Agatha. Two stupid grins stare back at them, Agatha’s face half hidden by Rio’s face. Rio’s green hoodie looks far too big on her but Agatha wore it nonetheless.</p><p>“I-,” Agatha pauses. “God I can’t remember the last time I saw myself so happy, it’s perfect.”</p><p>Her voice chokes up at the end of the sentence and Rio knows better than to push it further, repeating their movements and kissing Agatha on the cheek again, holding her that little bit tighter.</p><p>Rio stares at the photo, they look so fucking good together.</p><p>They look-</p><p>
<i>In love.</i>
</p><p>They slip it in their back pocket and they both continue hand in hand round the room until Rio spots them.</p><p>Agatha’s favourites.</p><p>Turns out Agatha spots them too. “Rio look oh my god there’s a whole patch of them, god they’re beautiful.”</p><p>“Aren’t they just,” Rio exclaims, face lighting up at Agatha’s excitement.</p><p>“What do you know then Mr Plant Guy?”</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath before letting the biggest plant word vomit of the day, who could blame them for learning as much as they could about their favourite person's favourite flower.</p><p>“Okay so, azaleas are interesting actually. They are a member of the Rhododendron family and they come in over a thousand varieties in multiple colours like pink, orange, yellow and as you already know, purple. Oh if you put them in too much sunlight their leaves will burn.”</p><p>“Like they burn witches?” Agatha interrupts.</p><p>Rio can’t help but laugh. “Sure babe, like they burn witches. You can plant them alone, like they have done here or you can mass plant them in more kind of wooded areas but if you’re going to do this you have to avoid mixing evergreen and deciduous plants. Remember like I explained earlier. Oh they would look so nice alongside ferns. Maybe I should plant them in my little garden out front? Anyways, that is a thought for later.”</p><p>Agatha listens so intently as Rio stops to take a breath before rapidly continuing. “Azaleas are also extremely poisonous, like every single variety. There is a toxin in them called grayanotoxins-”</p><p>“You’re such a nerd, I fucking love you,” Agatha laughs.</p><p>“That if a human or animal was to ingest them it would absolutely cause them harm. They bloom in April and May in the Northern Hemisphere and October and November in the-” Rio cuts off their spiel with a gasp. “Wait, what did you just say?”</p><p>Agatha’s face drops as it clicks. “God Rio fuck I’m sorry I didn’t think, it just came out naturally.”</p><p>“You love me?” Rio asks shyly, suddenly forgetting every single plant fact they’d ever learnt.</p><p>“I- fuck,” Agatha’s voice cracks. “It’s too soon isn’t it? God I’m so fucking stupid, I’m sorry Rio please can we just ignore it?”</p><p>“You love me?” Rio says again, more power behind their voice this time.</p><p>The silence holds for a minute as they stare at each other, neither of them rushing to talk next.</p><p>“Yeah, I think I do,” Agatha exhales. “No, I <i>know</i> I do. I love you, Rio.”</p><p>“Oh my god you love me,” Rio exclaims. “Agatha Harkness is in love with me!”</p><p>Rio grins wide, unable to hide how excited they feel. For weeks they have been thinking about telling Agatha that they love her but always too scared to push her away. Multiple times have they been in situations where they were sure one of them was going to say it and neither of them did.</p><p>But this is it.</p><p>Agatha really loves them.</p><p>Sure it slipped out but the words held so much truth in them and the confirmation is all Rio could ever ask for.</p><p>“Fuck off Rio,” she teases as she swings her arms round Rio’s hips. “I love you Rio Vidal because and in spite of the fact that you are a loser. You are a loser that I am so hopelessly and utterly fucking in love with.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth goes dry, never did they ever think they would experience this properly. Experience love for what it truly should be.</p><p>“And I love you,” Rio grins. “From the moment I stepped foot into your office I was stupidly dreaming about getting the chance to love you and the fact that it's happening? I have never felt so lucky in my entire life. I love you.”</p><p>Rio leans in, brushing their lips against Agatha’s softly. It’s like the final piece has just clicked into place and Rio couldn’t picture it happening any other way, it is so them.</p><p>They stand in that silent bubble for a while before Rio eventually removes their forehead from Agatha’s.</p><p>“Oh my god I am <i>never</i> going to stop saying it, you’ve no idea what you’ve just unleashed in me,” Rio smirks. “I love Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha blushes. “God it feels so right finally hearing it from your lips.”</p><p>“I LOVE AGATHA HARKNESS,” Rio yells, causing a group of people to stare at them.</p><p>“Rio oh my god shut up,” Agatha giggles, cheeks starting to warm as she avoids eye contact with all the eyes on them.</p><p>“Nope, I am never shutting up ever again thank you very much.”</p><p>—</p><p>Shortly after Rio spends nearly an hour in the shop picking out seeds for their garden, they finally make their way back to the car.</p><p>“Agathaaaa,” Rio prompts as Agatha starts the car.</p><p>“Yes my love?”</p><p>“I love you by the way,” Rio says proudly.</p><p>Agatha laughs, if she could count the ‘I Love You’ tally is probably already at one thousand. It is a weird sensation, she used to hate hearing it from Wanda, she knew there was no meaning behind those words, no feeling. But with Rio, despite how many times they’ve already said it to her, she can feel the meaning every time.</p><p>“You know it’s weird,” Rio begins. “I know we don’t like talking about Hela but sometimes I compare things and how they were then and how they are now in my head. Not in a bad way, more in a ‘look how far I’ve come’ type of way, god I’m rambling sorry you must feel like you're back in session.”</p><p>“Don’t you ever stop,” Agatha laughs. “I hope I get to listen to you ramble for the rest of my life, it’s good to talk these things out. Keep going baby.”</p><p>“When I used to tell Hela I loved her, it made my chest genuinely ache. I think at one point I did really mean it or thought I could feel it one day. But things changed so fast between us I’m not even sure I did really get to feel that, it was more like a chore, saying it because we had to because that’s what you do in relationships I guess. But now it still aches but in a very different way.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha prompts, she doesn't think her love is hurting Rio but is ready to hear them out either way.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio sighs. “It aches because it’s so full, does that make sense? Like I feel so full of love for you but also for myself and us. I want to love you everyday Agatha and I hope that I’m giving you all the love you deserve and more, I hope I’ll always be enough.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath wavers, tears threatening to spill down her cheeks instantly. “More than enough, always. Don’t ever doubt that for a second.”</p><p>The rest of the journey is spent speaking about little moments where they wanted to say it or times they felt loved by the other. In all fifteen years Agatha was with Wanda, she never noticed the little things the way she does with Rio.</p><p>“The moment I saw you in my shirt the morning after you stayed round for the first time, I could’ve said it then actually,” Rio offers shyly. “I certainly felt it.”</p><p>Their exchanges keep coming, slowly getting more ridiculous as they make their way through the front door. Soft giggles echo against the walls as Agatha tugs Rio up the stairs and they stumble through the bedroom door.</p><p>“Say it again,” Rio whispers, their hands coming up to tug at the hoodie, letting it fall with a soft thud. “Just one more time.”</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha says softly, lips brushing against Rio’s cheek before her own hands start wandering.</p><p>Rio pulls her back in then, lips pressing firm and soft against Agatha’s mouth, fingers tangling in her hair trying to keep her close. Letting the words settle, letting them fully sink in and saying a silent prayer that they are words that will never stop being said. Hoping they fill every inch of space until there's no room for any more doubt to ever spill out.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio’s been working on this build for almost five months now, they would never complain about their job but this one is beginning to become a little repetitive. It’s just them and the apprentice on a rare weekend on site where they’re trying to get things moving along a bit faster.</p><p>They’ve both already taken about twelve coffee breaks and the apprentice is insistent on getting Rio to make a tiktok with him. Rio’s currently sanding the floorboards as the teen films them out of the corner of their eye.</p><p>“Fuck,” they mutter as the sanding belt suddenly snaps. “Teen can you go grab me a fresh one out the truck please? The piece of shit has just snapped on me.”</p><p>Rio chucks the machine onto the floor, muttering under their breath as the teenager just stares back at them. “Teen? Hello? A new sanding belt please.”</p><p>“Uh- oh what?” the teen replies, eventually pulling his head away from his phone.</p><p>“Fresh sanding belt. I need one. Go get it please,” Rio snaps in the corner of the room. “I’ve already asked come on man if we’re going to work a weekend you at least have to do some work.”</p><p>“Please will you let me make this tiktok of you, you can work whilst I do it and then I <i>swear</i> it will go away for the rest of the day and I will work harder than I have done in the last five months,” the teen suggest as he makes puppy eyes towards Rio.</p><p>If Rio has to ask this boy for the sanding belt one more time they might actually lose it, it’s rare that they lose their cool at work but he is certainly going the right way about making it happen today.</p><p>“Oh my god, fine! If you go and get me the sanding belt out the truck, you can make a stupid video if it’ll make you actually do something around here today,” Rio groans.</p><p>The teen doesn’t even dignify them with a response and quite literally skips out of the front door and towards the truck. Eventually he returns and begins filming as Rio switches the belt out.</p><p>Unfortunately for Rio, the house turns into a shooting studio for the next half an hour whilst Teen directs the video. They’ve given up on trying to do any proper work and they were beginning to get bored of the tasks anyway so it wouldn’t hurt to have a little fun.</p><p>The video starts with Rio carrying several slabs of wood over their shoulder and walking into the house. Teen makes them do it three times claiming that ‘I just can’t see enough of your biceps.’</p><p>Once he’s satisfied they move into the back of the house where the station is set up and he films Rio cutting the panels to size for the flooring, this takes about fifteen minutes and Rio wonders what the fuck he is going to do with a fifteen minute video of them cutting planks of wood but they don’t question it.</p><p>Sure they’re not exactly doing the task at hand but the prep would help the team out in the long run. Next, Teen orders Rio to start laying the flooring in the kitchen.</p><p>“Okay that’s perfect but can you do it again and wink into the camera this time,” Teen directs to Rio who’s crouching on the floor.</p><p>Rio laughs. “Fuck no I’m too awkward for that.”</p><p>“Please,” Teen pleads. “Just do it once and I’ll make it less awkward I promise.”</p><p>So Rio does, places a floorboard, hammers it in and throws a wink over their shoulder and carries on, being sure not to make any form of eye contact with the apprentice. Rio continues with the flooring, letting the Teen work around them.</p><p>“Surely we’re almost done now Teen, we’ve got shit to do,” Rio asks, turning round to see that he is now sitting in the corner with his headphones in on his phone. “Teen!”</p><p>“Fuck yeah okay, can you just do one more thing for me and then I’m finished I swear.”</p><p>Teen makes them swing their hammer around whilst leaning against the worktop, Rio is sure this is the most awkward they have ever looked in their life so when Teen eventually shows them the finished video they’re pretty shocked.</p><p>They look good, hot even. The white tank and black cargo shorts, tool belt clinging to their hips as they moved.</p><p>“You’re kidding me you made me a thirst trap,” Rio laughs, pinching the bridge of their nose with their fingers. “You posting that?”</p><p>“Yeah why not I have like three followers so no one is going to see it anyway, are they,” Teen laughs adding the caption ‘Thanking god everyday I bat for the other team because this is what my boss looks like.’</p><p>He clicks post and throws his phone on the counter, neither of them spare a second thought to the video and Rio gives him his credit as he works hard for the hours that follow, not once picking up his phone to text his stupid boyfriend.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha doesn’t have too much to do this weekend, she had a meeting with her lawyer first thing and has just been completing mundane household tasks. She hates nights away from Rio but they both agreed they were important to have and it made the time they did spend together even more important.</p><p>It’s currently just after four and she’s poured herself a small glass of wine before scrolling through new client forms, attempting to pass the time until Rio says they’re on their way home from work so they can call. She is almost falling asleep when her phone vibrates with a text from Jen.</p><p>
<b>Jen: Alice sent me this asking if you guys need a third (divorce pending).</b>
</p><p>One attachment.</p><p>Agatha is puzzled, she clicks on the link instantly and it takes her to the app store and makes her download and make an account before she can view the video. She’s sat up on the sofa now, frustratingly verifying her email for the dumb app she told Rio she would never download. The video isn’t from Rio’s own account which confuses her even more.</p><p>Finally she can click play.</p><p>Somehow she remains confused. The video plays and Agatha watches Rio at work, carrying flooring on their shoulder, hammering said flooring and flipping a hammer round. <i>What a nerd,</i> she thinks.</p><p>She watches it again, still in silence, her eyes focus in on their biceps knowing exactly the strength they have to do things to her. No matter how confused she is she cannot pull her eyes away.</p><p>Eventually she realises the volume is off and clicks it all the way up for the third watch. Fucking <i>Father Figure</i> jesus christ, she has to laugh.</p><p>But somehow that just begins to work her up even more. Agatha is more than aware how awkward Rio can be, but this? Fuck they look so fucking good.</p><p>Agatha watches it again, watching Rio throw a wink over their shoulder and the action goes straight to her core. She settles a hand beneath her waistband as it plays for the fifth time, Agatha noticing a new action each time she watches it. The heat rises on her cheeks and the wetness grows between her thighs, she swears she has never been so attracted to a person in her life. And the fact that Agatha gets them all to herself, well that is even better.</p><p>She has no idea how the stupid app works but eventually she figures out how to pause the video so she can zoom in on those muscles that flash beneath Rio’s tank top when their arms lift, who could blame her. As soon as she swipes her clit for the first time she attempts to zoom in with her spare hand, exhaling as the tension disappears.</p><p>But because Agatha has absolutely no idea how the app works some stupid pop up comment appears on the screen instead.</p><p>
<i>‘WLW?’ </i>
</p><p>“Stupid fucking pop up,” She grunts, swiping it away so she could get back to getting off to her stupidly fit lesbian boyfriend.</p><p>No matter how hard she tries she just cannot get it zoomed properly. Her hand begins to slow as she gets increasingly frustrated with the app, her eyes flicker over to the side of the screen where she spots the ‘like’ button. The number beneath she can only assume is how many other people have liked this video.</p><p>
<i>What the fuck?</i>
</p><p>Thirty four thousand.</p><p>Thirty four thousand one hundred.</p><p>Thirty four thousand two hundred.</p><p>Every time Agatha blinks the number jumps up even higher and the video had only been posted six hours ago.</p><p>Her eyes float even lower to the comment button.</p><p>“Twelve thousand?” she shrieks in shock pulling her hand out of her underwear and jumping to her feet.</p><p>She scrolls quickly, her heart racing as she takes in all the comments about <i>her</i> Rio. They started off pretty tame, some Agatha actually found funny.</p><p>Turns out that ‘WLW?’ she had seen just moments ago was not a pop up and was in fact the start of twelve thousand people dying over <i>her</i> Rio.</p><p>
<i>“Suddenly I need a new kitchen floor.” </i>
</p><p>
<i>“Just had to take a lap.” </i>
</p><p>A lap? What the fuck did that mean.</p><p>She keeps reading, unintentionally pacing in the living room as she does.</p><p>
<i>“Rock, paper, definitely scissor.” </i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do you do weddings? Like as the bride?” </i>
</p><p>
<i>“Need them to hammer my floors.” </i>
</p><p>“Oh I think fucking not,” Agatha grits.</p><p>Agatha should stop reading, should put her phone away and wait to tease Rio about their new found fame later but she doesn’t.</p><p>
<i>“That wink was for me right? Guess we’re married now.” </i>
</p><p>
<i>“Me and my boyfriend were never that serious anyways.” </i>
</p><p>
<i>“Need those biceps to crush the fuck outta me.” </i>
</p><p>
<i>“Scrolling feels like divorce.”</i>
</p><p>The more Agatha reads, the more she seethes, she sees red. Comments about the size of Rio’s strap, their fingers, biceps, you name it there’s a comment about it. No one gets to talk about Rio that way. Rio’s strap is for her and only her and Agatha decides that she is going to make extra sure that Rio’s aware of that. Suddenly she isn’t spending the night away from Rio after all.</p><p>She throws the rest of the glass of wine down her throat while frantically booking a cab on her phone and heading out the door. She estimates she’s got an hour to go to a <i>very</i> specific shop and back.</p><p>She cannot believe how fucking frustrated and turned on she is right now, feelings of how badly she needs Rio mixed with how badly she wants to torture them are flooding her core.</p><p>After tonight, Rio is never going to forget who they come home to.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio has barely been in the door five minutes before they hear the lock click again, confusion sets in as Agatha was supposed to be spending the evening at her place. Rio steps into the hall, watches as Agatha gives them a once over. Her eyes have a glint in them that Rio isn’t sure they are familiar with and they aren’t sure if they should be alarmed or excited.</p><p>“My love?” Rio says, swallowing hard as Agatha steps in further to the house, her eyes now piercing into Rio’s and the closer she gets the more excitement Rio starts to feel.</p><p>“Mm, busy day?” Agatha hums,stopping just short of where Rio stands, now leaning against the door to the living room. “Looked it.”</p><p>Rio narrows their eyes, trying to see if they can figure out what that is supposed to mean without explicitly asking but nothing. So they let out a long breath and push off the wall. “Something I am missing here baby?”</p><p>Agatha lets out a huffed laugh as she folds her arms against her chest once Rio is close enough to touch. Before Rio’s hands are able to even brush against her, she is gone, stepping round Rio and making her way upstairs.</p><p>The quiet thud of her feet stops and Rio tracks her, eyebrows raised and they seem to be waiting for some sort of command because they can’t seem to move, unsure of what the fuck is happening.</p><p>“Bab-”</p><p>“Upstairs, now.”</p><p>Rio, who really should be a bit more observant, lets out a long breath followed by a ‘yes ma’am’ and takes the steps two at a time, flashing a proud smile while they bounce on their heels as they step into the bedroom.</p><p>“I saw something really interesting today,” Agatha says, taking each step towards Rio so slowly that they attempt to close the gap themselves but Agatha shakes her head and they stop in place. “You really have no idea what I am talking about?”</p><p>“Uh-”</p><p>“I always wondered what you did at work all day,” Agatha continues, lips curling into a wicked smirk when she sees the flash of realisation happen in front of her.</p><p>“Wait what? How did you see that Billy has like three followers?” Rio asks, dumbfounded.</p><p>“What is it the kids say these days?” Agatha pretends to stop and think. “Oh yeah, well handsome it looks like you went viral.”</p><p>At this point Rio really wishes the ground could swallow them whole because what the fuck did Agatha mean they had gone viral.</p><p>“O-okay?” Rio really doesn’t know what's happening right now but the way Agatha’s lips twitch as she speaks, almost possessively has Rio wondering exactly what's going through that big beautiful brain of hers right now.</p><p>“Wait, you have tiktok?”</p><p>“Irrelevent,” Agatha snaps, finally close enough that Rio can feel the heat radiate from her, their fingers twitching to reach out but something is telling them that is not the right move so they wait. “Do you want to know what is relevant?”</p><p>Rio nods, holding their breath, eyes tracking every movement Agatha makes as her hands start to reach for the hem of Rio’s tank.</p><p>“That nineteen thousand people have openly admitted to wanting to fuck you today,” Agatha says through gritted teeth, her nails making contact with the skin on Rio’s stomach at the same time.</p><p>“Nine-”</p><p>If looks could kill, boy would Rio be done for. So instead of continuing whatever stupid ass remark they were about to, Rio attempts to bring their hands up to cover Agatha’s but another shake of the head tells them that's a no to.</p><p>“Do you want to hear some of my favourites?”</p><p>Definitely a trap.</p><p>“Baby,” Rio says softly, biting back a smirk as they lean their head down. “Are you jealous?”</p><p>Definitely the wrong thing to say.</p><p>Agatha growls, nails sinking in a little harsher as blue eyes glare up at them. “Me? Jealous? Don’t make me laugh.”</p><p>“So,” Rio treads carefully. “What is happening right now?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha smirks. “I just find it funny that-”</p><p>Definitely jealous.</p><p>Rio knew they felt that excitement start to bubble for a reason, would they purposely make Agatha jealous? Absolutely not. However will they happily find out what it unleashes in Agatha? Absolutely.</p><p>“Funny that?” Rio prompts, head tilting to encourage her to continue.</p><p>“@bushtruther69 ‘would let them rearrange my insides with that hammer and say thank you afterwards’,” Agatha quotes, a growl slipping out as the last word leaves her lips.</p><p>Rio is stunned honestly, because one that’s insane, completely and utterly insane but also two that is the funniest handle they have ever heard.</p><p>“@lesbianlover321 ‘watch your fingers I’ll need them later’.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs dramatically after that one, mumbling something incoherent under her breath and Rio has to chew on their lip to stop the giggle that is threatening to escape their lips.</p><p>They haven’t seen the comments, didn’t know it had been seen by anyone else until this exact moment but they had a feeling they might need to go thank some of those comments after whatever is about to happen to them happens.</p><p>“Oh you’ll probably love this one,” Agatha says with an eye roll. “@constructionwife ‘daddy?’”</p><p>Rio is really trying to push some buttons here so with a little bravery (stupidity) they poke their tongue in their cheek, wait for Agatha to track the movement before smirking. “Oh?”</p><p>The thing about jealousy (which Agatha absolutely isn’t) is that it sets off something feral inside of you. Rio is finding out exactly what jealousy looks like on Agatha and honestly? Don’t save them. They are exactly where they want to be.</p><p>Before they can even blink they are stripped down to nothing but their christmas special edition snoopy boxers, which would be much more humiliating if Agatha wasn’t looking at them like she is about to rip them off with her teeth.</p><p>If only Rio could be so lucky.</p><p>Instead their back hits the mattress and they have to watch as Agatha peels off her clothes one stupid layer at a time, her eyes not once leaving Rio’s as she does. No words, only a disapproving tut sent Rio’s ways when they attempt to help get things moving along.</p><p>It’s only then that they realise they might actually be being tortured and this is only the beginning.</p><p>Agatha has to have thought this out, has to have planned it because Rio is absolutely certain they have never seen this before. They watch the painfully slow reveal and Agatha finally stands in nothing but green lace. The thin strapped bodysuit hugs her curves perfectly leaving absolutely nothing up to Rio’s imagination, they let their eyes roam further down Agatha’s chest and can see her already hardened nipples peering through the lace.</p><p>The florals splay out across her ribs as Rio lets their eyes trail over them, determined to take every inch of the incredible woman in front of them and commit it to memory.</p><p>“<i>Fuck.</i>”</p><p>Agatha hums, teasing her fingers down the front of the bodysuit, tracing over her nipples and down her stomach. Rio tracks every single movement, suppressing the whine that is lodged in their throat. “Do you like it?”</p><p>Insane question really.</p><p>“I-,” Rio nods frantically, watching as Agatha starts to make a slow crawl onto the bed, each dip of the mattress sending a fresh wave of heat down Rio’s spine. “You look incredible.”</p><p>“Oh I know,” Agatha purrs. “So here’s what's going to happen-”</p><p>Rio tries to keep eye contact, they really do, but when Agatha draws closer and they can feel the warmth of her thighs brush against their own, they can’t help but let their eyes wander. Watching as Agatha moves to straddle them, not once letting her hands touch anywhere but her own skin. When all Rio wants is to have them pressed against their own.</p><p>“I’m going to remind you of what you have, but there are rules,” Agatha continues, smirking when Rio’s eyes find their way back to meet hers and she can see the cogs turning in Rio’s mind. “Rule one, no touching. You are gonna keep your hands to yourself, can you do that?”</p><p>The whine Rio has been suppressing finally slips out and they shake their head, hands already inching closer to brush against the soft skin in front of them. “No,” Rio pouts. “I want to touch you.”</p><p>“Then I will have to restrain you,” Agatha says matter of factly. “Can I do that?”</p><p>Rio is absolutely sure they will not be able to stop themselves from breaking that rule and they are also not sure what the consequences will be if they do. Which is a risk they aren’t willing to take and more importantly the thought of Agatha having full control has Rio three seconds from dry humping the gap between them.</p><p>“Fuck okay,” Rio pants out, watching as an excited glint sparks in Agatha’s eye as soon as the words leave their mouth.</p><p>“You’re sure?” Agatha asks reassuringly.</p><p>“God yes, quick before I break the damn rule,” Rio replies, nails biting into the sheets beneath them.</p><p>Rio is so sure they are going to come as soon as Agatha’s fingers make any sort of contact.</p><p>They have never experimented like this, some light jokes about it here and there but this is real and Rio is more than ready to comply. They bring their wrists up in front of them, a sly smile creeping across their face and they watch Agatha falter just slightly, clearly just as affected as Rio is in this moment.</p><p>She swallows it back and flashes her teeth as she leans in just slightly. “Good boy.”</p><p>Agatha reaches for the box under the bed, pulling out those damn ropes that Rio accidentally bought all those months ago. They silently curse themselves for buying them as Agatha unfolds the two ropes in her hands, although they’re sure she would’ve thought of something else even if Rio hadn’t bought them.</p><p>Rio pushes their wrists out further, any composure they thought they had has gone completely out the window.</p><p>“Aw,” Agatha pouts. “So sweet that you thought I’d let you keep them in front of you. No touching me or yourself. Now stretch them out above you.”</p><p>“Agatha, fuck no, I don’t get to touch you at all? That’s torture,” Rio groans.</p><p>Agatha laughs. “What was rule number one Rio?”</p><p>“No touching?”</p><p>“Good boy see, now do as I asked.”</p><p>Rio complies, stretching their arms to either side of their head in a V shape. Agatha makes her way to the right side of them, looping one round the bed post before taking Rio’s wrist into her hand and quickly tying a knot which causes Rio to make a mental note to ask how she did that so quickly later on.</p><p>Agatha slips two fingers under the rope, checking it isn’t too tight against their skin. “And you know what to say if it gets too much?” She whispers, her voice softening for half a second.</p><p>“Red,” Rio sighs at the loss of contact against their skin as Agatha removes her fingers.</p><p>“Mmm good boy and what are you now?”</p><p>The praise hits them like a jolt. “G- Green, Green so fucking green,” they reply, hips thrusting against nothing.</p><p>Agatha moves to the left side to repeat the same action, restraining the wrist quickly, placing two fingers under the rope and then checking in with Rio again. She returns to the end of the bed, sitting on her knees and looking at them like they are about to well and truly devoured.</p><p>“Poor baby, you want to touch me so bad. I trust you can behave yourself now, don’t push me because I can tie you to this mattress a lot better than I have done. I’ll stop your pathetic squirming if I have too as well,” Agatha warns. “You understand?”</p><p>Rio nods desperately, wrists already thrashing at the restraints in an attempt to reach out for her. Rio stares, unsure of where the next hour is going to take them but if they die from not being able to touch Agatha, they somehow wouldn’t rather go any other way.</p><p>“Rule two,” Agatha states confidently.</p><p>These rules might kill Rio off before anything actually has the chance to happen.</p><p>“Your eyes,” Agatha continues. “They stay on me at <i>all</i> times. If you’re not looking at me I’ll assume you’d rather be looking at something else and honestly you’d rather not find out what happens if you do that.”</p><p>Rio can’t help but smirk a little at that rule, it’s not going to be a challenge for them to keep their eyes on Agatha. That is never a challenge, less of a challenge when she looks this insane as well. But they can’t help but wonder what Agatha would do if they let their eyes flicker away.</p><p>It’s almost as if Agatha can see the cogs turning in their head and she grits a low ‘don’t push me Rio’ that tells them they are absolutely going to keep their eyes on her for however long this lasts.</p><p>Rio nods.</p><p>“And finally, rule three. Don’t think about any other women,” Agatha hisses, beginning to make her way closer to Rio.</p><p>“Now why the fuck would I ev-“</p><p>“I saw the ways your eyes lit up when you heard one of those nineteen thousand freaks called you ‘daddy,’” Agatha warns.</p><p>Oh shit. Rio is <i>so</i> fucking done for.</p><p>Before Rio can even get a chance to respond, warm hands land heavy on their thighs and Agatha’s thumbs start a slow journey up the inside of them. Rio sucks in a breath the higher she climbs, their boxers are long since ruined and Agatha chuckles cruelly as she makes contact with the soaked fabric, she leans down and brushes her lips against Rio’s clit. Their hips move on their own, trying to chase the contact but it's gone before it even really lands and all Rio can do is whine as the hands now trace up their stomach and splay on their ribs as Agatha now hovers above them.</p><p>“You thought this was about me getting you off?” Agatha asks, finally settling herself down until she is sitting against Rio’s stomach. “No baby, I’m going to make you watch as I do.”</p><p>Rio is too focused on the fact they can feel the warmth of Agatha’s cunt pressed against their stomach, already wet enough that the lace is damp as it presses against their skin, that they don’t fully register what she has just said. Their eyes are much too focused on the sight in front of them, that they don’t really remember how to form a single sentence.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha snaps, leaning forward, a hand coming up to grip their jaw so they are forced out of their daze. “Are you paying attention?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio chokes out, having Agatha this close and not being able to reach out is almost painful. “This isn’t fair.”</p><p>Agatha chuckles, letting go of Rio’s jaw and bringing both hands down to their chest. “It’s not supposed to be fair, it’s a reminder of what you get to come home to everyday. You’ll be good and let me show you.”</p><p>It wasn’t a question, her tone soft and sweet but the sharp gaze she has on Rio is anything but. As thumbs brush slowly over Rio’s nipples, teasing against their piercings they almost miss the first shift of hips as Agatha starts moving against them. Almost.</p><p>“<i>Fuck</i>,” Rio fights against the restraints as they pull up to get a better view, tensing their stomach with the movement and getting to watch as Agatha’s jaw slackens and her first moan fills the room. “<i>Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.</i>”</p><p>Agatha hands still as she focuses on pressing herself more firmly against the muscles that contract with every shift of her hips. Rio gets to watch as her arousal slowly starts to smear against their skin, the lace no longer able to stop it from seeping through. Rio doesn’t know where to look. They want to see everything all at once, the way Agatha’s eyes fight to stay open as she works herself against them. Then also getting to watch the way her body moves against them is mesmerising and so fucking hot that Rio can feel the heat pooling low in their stomach. One more moan from Agatha is going to tip them over the edge.</p><p>“Can you feel how badly I want you?” Agatha asks through stuttered breaths as she starts to pick up her pace. She watches as Rio nods, eyes still flicking back and forth frantically. “I feel so empty, a shame really if only I could untie you.”</p><p>“Please baby, fuck please, let me help,” Rio pleads, finally finding their voice again.</p><p>“No,” Agatha pouts. “I like seeing you like this.”</p><p>Rio groans, eyes closing in frustration.</p><p>“Whats rule number two?” Agatha scolds, fingers coming back up to press into Rio’s chin, her lips just a breath away as she leans in. “Rio, what's rule number two?”</p><p>The soft growl she lets out when Rio doesn’t immediately respond is so hot that Rio’s eyes snap open and they need to hear it again.</p><p>“I forgot,” Rio smirks, pressing themselves into her hold, thighs clamping together to try and ease the ache that’s between them. “Can you repeat it?”</p><p>Agatha bares her teeth, letting out something close to a snarl as she grinds harder against Rio, the disobedience clearly fuelling something in her. “I’ll blindfold you so you can’t watch as I come, you’ll just have to listen as I fall apart. Is that what you want?”</p><p>Rio whimpers at that because absolutely not. Their eyes settle back on blue ones that are now half lidded and she looks close to ruin. “I’m sorry my love, my eyes will be on you.”</p><p>“Good because I am so fucking close,” Agatha pants, her breath warm against Rio’s lips and she doesn’t move from where she leans, just keep her hips moving and her fingers held tight. “Seeing how badly you want to touch me, fuck, you have no idea how good you look like this.”</p><p>“Please kiss me,” Rio begs, their own breathing stuttering as they feel fresh arousal meeting their skin.</p><p>The desperation in Rio wanting to have any form of contact with her has her soaked against Rio’s skin. Agatha lets out a drawn out moan instead of responding, clearly having found the perfect rhythm, her other hands coming to hold the headboard as she struggles to keep herself steady. Rio can feel the rope digging into their wrists as they instinctively try to reach out to catch her.</p><p>Rio isn’t sure Agatha even realises she does it but as her back arches and she pushes back as her orgasm hits her, the hand that was keeping her stable pushes off the wood and lands right against Rio’s cunt in an attempt to catch herself from falling back. The sudden pressure against them is all it takes for Rio to follow Agatha and both their moans hit off the walls, hips jolting and nails biting into flesh as they come undone.</p><p>“Fuck that was hot,” Agatha grins, her hand still cupping Rio, teasing against them as they still recover underneath her. “You had enough pretty boy?”</p><p>“God no,” Rio groans, head falling back against the pillow, the ache in their arms feels worth it as they watch Agatha smirk above them.</p><p>“Good because there’s another part of you I would really like to use to get myself off, you think you can handle it?”</p><p>Rio looks up wide eyed and curious. “Which part?”</p><p>“I’ll need to take this off first,” Agatha says as she sits up on her knees, fingers making their way to the thin straps at her shoulders. “If only you could help me take it off.”</p><p>Now she is just being evil, Rio has to watch as she inches the lace down her body, purposely running her hands over her chest before she works her way down. Rio is forced to watch as she pulls it down her slick stained thighs, making the awkward struggle to remove it entirely look effortless.</p><p>Rio is losing it, their hands curled into fists, lip caught between their teeth as they stifle another fucking whimper at how badly they want to run their fingers through Agatha’s soaked folds. She knows exactly what they want too because she crawls closer, close enough that Rio can see the arousal threatening to drip onto their chest and she puts one hand on the headboard, the other makes its way between her thighs.</p><p>The sound of her fingers meeting the wetness fills Rio’s ears and they bite down harder as she spreads herself open and dips her fingers between her folds. She watches Rio, knows exactly when they are desperate enough to beg for something, anything.</p><p>“Bab-”</p><p>“Tongue out,” Agatha commands, letting out a huffed laugh when Rio’s tongue is out before she even finishes.</p><p>Rio thinks they are going to get to taste from the fingers that are working against her, but when Agatha starts to shuffle further up until she is hovering right above where Rio’s tongue waits eagerly, all they can do is groan loudly in hopes it's enough to show how badly they want this.</p><p>Her knees pin Rio’s arms against the mattress, it’s awkward and Rio bites back the giggle that threatens to slip up their throat but it’s quickly forgotten as Agatha is barely an inch away from landing on their tongue. They could quite easily lean up and take but they know that it’s not theirs for the taking at this moment.</p><p>“Keep it flat unless asked otherwise,” Agatha says breathlessly, the anticipation for the warmth of Rio’s mouth already building her up. “Can you do that?”</p><p>Rio nods a bit too eagerly and their nose meets Agatha’s cunt right before their mouth does and they both gasp at the contact. The arousal drips into Rio’s mouth and they are already threatening to slip up because their tongue fights to take more of it, their eyes roll back at the taste.</p><p>If Rio thought they were struggling with Agatha grinding against their stomach and not being able to touch, well this is a completely different kind of torture. She lands warm and wet against Rio’s tongue and their first instinct is to press their mouth more firmly against her but before they can, fingers drag through their hair and snap Rio’s head back.</p><p>“Forgetting the rules already?” Agatha says, but there is no bite to it as Rio gets to watch her eyes flutter closed as she glides against their tongue.</p><p>With the grip in their hair, Agatha grinding herself down against Rio’s tongue and the perfect ripple of moans that come out of that beautiful mouth above them, it’s overwhelming in the best way. Rio can feel themselves soaking through the sheets, their boxers so fucking wet that they cling to their tighs uncomfortably and the faster Agatha works against their mouth, the more Rio struggles to hold back.</p><p>“You’re close already?” Agatha taunts, tugging a little hard and looking down into Rio’s blown out eyes with a smirk. “You like being used, baby?”</p><p>Rio’s moan vibrates against her, they can feel her thighs shake against the side of their head as she lets Rio’s muffled noises of pleasure bring her closer, grinding herself down against Rio’s nose. She’s so wet that it starts to drip against Rio’s cheeks, mixing with the tears that Rio has let slip as they fight the frustrated need to touch, to be touched.</p><p>“You need to come baby?” Agatha pants, leaning back, hips still working against their face as she lets her hand slide down Rio’s stomach, that's now slick with sweat, fingers teasing against the waistband on their boxers. “Come with me.”</p><p>Rio lets out a broken sob at that, with Agatha dripping onto their tongue, the fabric being slowly peeled away and the cool air hitting against Rio is almost enough to send them over the edge.</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha gasps as her fingers finally meet the slick between Rio’s thighs. “Oh sweetheart, you’ve been so good haven’t you. So fucking patient.”</p><p>Another whimper pressed against Agatha’s cunt, another tug at the restraints as her fingers start circling against Rio’s clit, still using Rio to reach her own orgasm. Rio’s hips buck against her touch causing her to press down harder, back arching further as she seems to get lost in wanting to please Rio now.</p><p>Rio can’t have that, can’t let her lose her own orgasm as it nears so fuck it, time to break some rules. As Agatha lifts off their tongue, Rio chases her, neck craning to clamp their mouth against her, pulling her clit between their lips and sucking gently at first, just to test.</p><p>“Oh fuck,” Agatha moans, fingers slipping against Rio as she threatens to fall back, her jaw dropping as she lets out gasps with every pull of Rio’s lips.</p><p>The sight, the lazy strokes against Rio’s clit and the sound of both their stuttered breaths filling the room has Rio coming, hard and fast. Their eyes roll back but their mouth keeps working, tongue dragging against Agatha before swirling against her clit with just the right amount of pressure.</p><p>Rio snaps their eyes open just in time to see it, the way Agatha’s eyes screw shut, her head falling back and tight press of nails against Rio’s thigh as she shakes above them and her orgasm hits Rio’s tongue.</p><p>The flush against Agatha’s chest and the sweat threatening to drip down from her brow is the most beautiful sight Rio gets to see as she settles herself back down against Rio’s stomach. Both their chests rise and fall in sync as they come down.</p><p>“Wow,” Rio sighs, head falling back against the pillows with a breathy laugh. “You’re insane.”</p><p>Agatha chuckles, dropping down so her chest is flush with Rio’s, her lips lingering close enough that Rio can feel the warm puffs of breath as her breathing starts to settle again. She smiles as she nudges Rio’s nose with her own and all Rio can is let their mouth curl up and they grin back.</p><p>“You’re a mess,” Agatha whispers, letting her lips finally brush against Rio’s, soft and gentle. “You were so good for me.”</p><p>Rio hums, letting the warmth of Agatha’s mouth melt into their own, mumbling between kisses. “I’ll never forget who I come home to.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha smiles into the kiss. “But this will absolutely happen again.”</p><p>“And you thought I would ever be tempted by freaks online? Crazy,” Rio smirks. “Not a chance.”</p><p>“Alice did ask if we are looking for a third,” Agatha says, letting out a laugh.</p><p>Rio cocks their eyebrow, leaning back as a playful grin creeps onto their face. “Interesting.”</p><p>Agatha hums, lips pressing against Rio’s jaw. “Behave.”</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha is spent, forgetting how hard it is to do all the work the entire time but she wouldn’t have done it any different. Rio looks utterly ruined beneath her, wrists still tied tightly above their head. She didn’t think she would enjoy torturing them this much but watching them lose control over how badly they wanted her? God she could do this for hours. Sure she was just teasing them but it reminded her how badly they only wanted her too.</p><p>Lessons learned all round.</p><p>She watches as Rio seems to finally have recovered, their chest rising and falling gently as they look at her.</p><p>“Let me hold you now, please?” Rio whispers. “Need you.”</p><p>“Of course baby,” Agatha replies, returning the top of their bed and undoing the ropes almost as quickly as she did them up.</p><p>Rio wastes no time, reaching out to touch whatever part of Agatha’s skin they can get a hold of first.</p><p>“Hey let me see your wrists please, I promise you’ll have all the time in the world to hold me later but let me take care of you first. Please?” Agatha says softly, running her fingers over the light indents on Rio’s wrists left by the rope.</p><p>“Mmm,” Rio winces.</p><p>Fuck were the ropes too tight? No Rio would’ve said.</p><p>“God so sensitive, doesn’t hurt though,” Rio reassures her, having spotted the uncertainty in her eyes.</p><p>“You sure?” Agatha prompts. It has been so long since she’s been in this situation she wasn’t sure if she still had it in her.</p><p>Rio nods, bringing their arms up to snake around Agatha’s waist and pulling her into them. Their lips pressing against her neck as they hold her close, stay like that until the tiredness starts to creep in.</p><p>Eventually they begin to make their way through to the bathroom, Agatha silently thankful that Rio has an en-suite so they didn’t have to go too far. She spent far too long on her knees and is already feeling the pain. As if Rio can read her mind they pick her up and carry her the final ten steps to the bathroom.</p><p>“Jesus you really are insane huh?” Rio laughs as Agatha sits down on the toilet.</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha smirks. “I was going to say ‘I saw no complaints from you’ but I saw many actually, so whiney and they way you were thrashing against those ropes too no wonder you have friction burn..”</p><p>Rio’s face flushes red. “Well yeah I have never been so desperate to touch you in my whole life but also I was exactly where I wanted to be so…”</p><p>“Fair enough,” Agatha laughs.</p><p>She needs Rio just as much as Rio needs her right now so she reaches out a hand, prompting Rio to take a hold of it whilst she sits on the toilet. Once Agatha finishes they swap and Agatha takes their hand in return.</p><p>It’s these small moments afterwards where Agatha is reminded how much Rio loves her and wants to take care of her.</p><p>“Lesson learned?” Agatha teases.</p><p>Rio scoffs. “Very much so but if <i>that’s</i> what I’m going to get for making a silly TikTok video? Maybe I need to get Teen to make videos of me more often.”</p><p>Agatha says absolutely nothing and shoots them a sharp look right back instead.</p><p>“Shower?” Rio eventually prompts.</p><p>Agatha nods softly in return, dropping Rio’s hand and turning to switch the shower on.</p><p>They shower in almost complete silence, falling into their perfectly practiced routine of looking after the other.</p><p>Agatha takes care of Rio first, focusing on the areas she knows they like best. She grabs shower gel, lathering it into her hands and working it into their shoulders as they let the water run over them both.</p><p>“You were perfect, so good for me my love,” Agatha whispers against their skin as she works the soap down their back.</p><p>Rio lies their head back, falling right into Agatha’s touch. “It was everything, you are everything cariño.”</p><p>Agatha leans in, placing a soft kiss between their shoulder blades before asking them if they need anything else from her right now to which Rio shakes their head and takes the soap into their hands.</p><p>“You okay mi amor?” Rio prompts.</p><p>“More than okay, I love you,” Agatha smiles reassuringly as they run their hands down her ribs.</p><p>Rio continues to whisper hushed words of praise against Agatha’s skin as they finish up in the shower. Each word hits Agatha directly, realising that this truly is exactly where Rio wants to be and that is with her.</p><p>Sure she isn’t jealous at those women commenting on Rio’s video (she is) because beneath the horny torture she just gave Rio, she has never felt more wanted in her life. The way Rio is still looking at Agatha like she just hung the moon is everything and she hopes that Rio never loses that look in their eyes.</p><p>Because just like Rio, Agatha is exactly where she wants to be.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Quicker than either of them could expect, they had been together officially for four months but ten months since that first session had passed so quickly. Navigating and learning together, letting go of old habits and doubts from their past relationships and clinging onto new ones with each other.</p><p>Agatha’s divorce had been settled and official for three weeks now and so they’d planned a celebratory dinner at the end of the month. Wanda, to no one's surprise, had been a complete pain in the ass throughout the proceedings and Agatha had ended up giving her more than she intended. But quite frankly, she didn’t care. Hell she would have given Wanda everything because as long as she had Rio and their love, that was all she needed in her life.</p><p>Hands snake round her waist as she’s lost in thought whilst washing dishes, she can almost hear the shit eating grin that rests on her shoulder, Rio clearly being incredibly pleased with something they’ve done.</p><p>“Can I help you?” Agatha teases, placing a bowl into the drying rack.</p><p>“Mmm,” Rio muses. “Maybe?”</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Agatha reaches for the towel, drying her hands and turning to face them. She leans against the counter taking in their grey sweats and white binder that they’ve been practically living in since their birthday.</p><p>“Well, you know how we’re going out tonight, for celebrations and all that?”</p><p>“Yes, fuck I cannot wait for some good fucking food,” Agatha hums.</p><p>“Hey what’s wrong with my cooking?” Rio pouts, pretending to walk out the room.</p><p>Agatha laughs. “Absolutely nothing but the thought of not having to do the dishes turns me on so continue please.”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio grumbles and walks back to put their hands on Agatha’s waist. “How about we make it a double celebration? Got a little letter in the mail today telling me that you are not the only person officially divorced in this house anymore.”</p><p>Rio is practically vibrating in Agatha’s arms as they talk, their divorce proceedings had been on the easier side with Hela clearly scared of Agatha and willing to get things over with as quickly as possible.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha exclaims, as Rio picks her up, perching her ass on the counter.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio exhales, unbuttoning her jeans and kneeling as they begin to work them down her legs. “And I am celebrating by spending the day showing the woman of my dreams how grateful I am for her being by my side throughout.”</p><p>“Fuck Rio, <i>ohmygod,</i>” she moans as Rio’s fingers graze lightly against her. “I’m not missing my appointment so you better be fast.”</p><p>She feels that same shit eating grin return, her hand reaching out to grab their hair. She realises she doesn’t need to worry about the time as she begins to become totally undone at Rio’s touch.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio may or may not have spent the last few hours pacing the same stretch of floor in their bedroom, they may or may not be a little bit overwhelmed, discarded scraps of tape littered on the bed and floor from one too many failed attempts. They should have waited for Agatha, she always knows how to ease them when the frustration starts setting in at not being able to do something the first time round. Before they can do one more lap the door creaks open slowly, Agatha leans against the wood and lets a small smile settle against her lips as she watches.</p><p>“Not a pro yet?” She teases, the gentleness evident as she watches them turn to face her, lips pressing into a smirk as she looks at Rio standing in nothing but boxers. “You’ll get it baby, but maybe we try together?”</p><p>Rio pauses, eyes dragging from Agatha’s and up to her hair, they feel their lips part but no words come out like they intend, just a soft gasp as they gawk at her from her across the room.</p><p>“Y-your hair” Rio stutters, taking a few steps towards her. “Fuck, you put blonde through it?”</p><p>Agatha hums, turning so Rio can see it but as they reach out to grab the brown plastic that is holding it together Agatha whips round and scowls, grabbing Rio’s wrist mid-air. “No touching! You can do what you want to it later but I want to look good for you tonight. Do you like it?”</p><p>“You look incredible,” Rio whispers, motioning for her to spin again and pulling her in by the waist when she comes back to face them, leaning in with a grin. “Stunning.”</p><p>“He cut a few inches off… don’t look at me like that,” Agatha sighs, as Rio’s face crumbles grumpily. “You won’t even notice it.”</p><p>Rio mutters under their breath about that being a personal crime against them and doesn’t stop sulking until Agatha’s lips press against the crease between their eyebrows and down the slope of their nose before she presses a soft kiss to their lips. Of course Rio’s body betrays them as they melt into her touch and forgive her, the pout not even lasting a full ten seconds.</p><p>“You are beautiful my love,” Rio whispers against the softness of her lips.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth curls against theirs before she pulls back and takes Rio’s hand, leading them back to the evidence of their attempt at taping their chest. “Shall we try again?”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio replies, any previous frustration faded and replaced with gratefulness as they watch Agatha pick up a strip of already cut tape and the scissors. “I almost had it, but it just wasn’t perfect.”</p><p>“It doesn’t need to be perfect my love, as long as it's done safely and you feel good with the outcome, then that's what matters.”</p><p>Rio nods, watches as Agatha gently presses the guards down against their nipple with her thumb to make sure they are secure and studies Rio’s chest.</p><p>“Would you like me to do the first one and then you can do the next one?” Agatha asks gently. “I did some research so I could help if you ever asked.”</p><p>The words settle in Rio’s chest, sending a warmth over them as they chew on their cheek, fighting back the emotions that are threatening to spill. “You did?” Their voice barely audible.</p><p>“Of course, this is important to you, so it’s important to me,” Agatha smiles, brushing the stray tear that Rio wasn’t able to hold back. “May I?”</p><p>Rio stands straight, arms by their sides and gives another nod and they watch as Agatha takes care with her touch, tongue between her teeth as she concentrates on getting the tape pressed down, ensuring the adhesive is activated before she starts moving on to the next step.</p><p>They can’t tear their eyes away from her as she makes sure there are no creases, makes sure Rio can move comfortably and there is no discomfort to them or their breathing. Her hands, warm and safe against Rio’s skin.</p><p>“Perfect,” Agatha grins, running her hands over the tape and Rio still can’t take their eyes off her.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio finally manages to breathe out.</p><p>Agatha softens then, fingers coming to cup Rio’s cheeks as she leans up and presses her lips to theirs. “I love you, are you okay?”</p><p>“I don’t think I have ever felt so okay in my life,” Rio whispers, leaning their head against Agatha’s. “Can you do the other? You are clearly the pro here.”</p><p>They both laugh and Agatha gets to work, eyebrows pressed together as she tries to match her work on the left side and Rio lets their smile settle now, chest threatening to crack at how full it feels. When they let out a shaky breath, Agatha looks up in concern, fingers spreading against Rio’s ribs but they just shake their head.</p><p>“Just feeling really fucking lucky,” Rio says, waiting until Agatha finishes before pulling her in tight.</p><p>“Have you seen how hot you look baby?” Agatha questions, leaning back and turning so Rio can see themselves in the floor length mirror. “I think its me that’s really fucking lucky.”</p><p>Rio looks at themselves, twisting to the side, lifting their arms and stepping closer to the mirror and they feel fucking good.</p><p>Agatha steps in behind them, lips pressing to Rio’s shoulder as her hands wander across up their stomach and tracing across their chest. “So fucking handsome aren’t you?”</p><p>“I might be y’know?” Rio replies with a cocky grin, leaning back into Agatha and pressing a kiss to her cheek. “Thank you.”</p><p>“You can repay by tying my dress for me,” Agatha winks, letting her eyes linger a little longer on Rio in the mirror before she slips off to get ready for dinner, calling over her shoulder as she goes. “Be ready in twenty or I will go without you.”</p><p>Agatha would absolutely make good on that threat too.</p><p>But Rio is sure they have time to admire Agatha’s work for ten of those, right?</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Those twenty minutes slip by so fast that Rio is standing, shirt still open, pants unzipped and dick barely tucked in as they hear Agatha’s heels clicking against the floor.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Agatha stands in the hallway, staring at the mess her boyfriend is currently in. “Really? You are a nightmare I swear,” she laughs as she walks towards them.</p><p>This entire afternoon it has been near impossible for them to keep their eyes inside their sockets. Agatha looks fucking beautiful, the hair, the dress, the lipstick, <i>she</i> is fucking everything.</p><p>“Baby, you are,” Rio splutters. “Just fucking incredible.”</p><p>Agatha smiles softly, her cheeks glow with the compliment. She spins round so Rio can tie the halter neck she’s been holding onto.</p><p>Rio’s fingers make light work so used to helping Agatha over the months they’ve been together. They were near useless to begin with but they’re getting the hang of it now.</p><p>Agatha turns back round, dress tied and completely ready to go. She looks them up and down, running her fingertips lightly along the silicone between Rio’s thighs, smirking when they press their hips into her touch before removing it completely.</p><p>Rio groans, mouth turning down but before they can even get words out Agatha is already moving, hips swaying as she makes her way out the room.</p><p>“I paid a deposit for this,” she warns lightly, looking back over her shoulder. “So put your fucking dick away and be at the door in three minutes or you won’t get to help me out of this dress later.”</p><p>Another threat she would absolutely make good on, which is why Rio’s hands are already moving as she disappears from their view. Dick tucked in, buttons done up, their jacket halfway on as they stumble out the room. Agatha stands at the door, fingers drumming on her arms as she watches Rio leap halfway down the stairs and struggle to put on their shoes. She shakes her head as she steps in to straighten them up.</p><p>Agatha drags her eyes down the length of Rio and lets out a pleased hum, hands splaying over their chest and Rio gets to watch as she takes in a long breath before she steps away.</p><p>“You made it.”</p><p>“With one minute to spare,” Rio grins, chest heaving with their efforts.</p><p>Rio catches their reflection in the mirror by the door, the black shirt open at the top exposing their chest and the chain that they haven’t been able to take off since Agatha had put it on with gentle fingers. They have slowly started feeling more confident in themselves, feeling good about the person that they now see whenever they catch their reflection. However today they feel incredible.</p><p>It’s a big difference to how they had felt almost a year ago when they had avoided looking in mirrors where possible because they had hated the person that they saw. Someone who felt undeserving of more, who thought they had to fit into other people's ideals and not as who they had wanted to be. They just didn’t feel like Rio. That was a version of Rio they never wanted to see looking back at them again, a version that never truly knew what loving themselves felt like, one that never knew what love from other people should look like.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>As Rio looks at themselves right now all they can see is someone who is thriving, someone who is cared for, someone who is getting to care for others in the way they should have always been able to. They see a version of themselves that a fourteen year old Rio had dreamt up and wished to be one day.</p><p>Someone that knows they are deserving of everything that dream had been back then.</p><p>Rio runs their hands over the soft fabric of their shirt against their chest and smiles, feeling the weight of Agatha’s chin resting on their shoulder again as she comes to take in the view for herself.</p><p>Agatha has a knowing smile on her lips as her eyes meet Rio’s in the mirror, her hands resting against Rio’s side as she lets them finish their quiet reflection on how far they have come.</p><p>“Feeling good?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio sighs contently. “We look so good together.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a warm laugh against Rio’s ear. “No, we look fucking insane together.”</p><p>—</p><p>Rio has made it their mission to be a menace since they stepped foot out the front door. They have gotten to watch as Agatha’s resolve has slowly shattered as the night has gone on. The clatter of cutlery against plates, voices melting together and waiters zipping past their table all fade into the background and it's just them. Agatha swirling her wine glass, eyes trained on the wall in front of her because everytime they land on Rio for too long, the easier it looks like she will say yes to whatever Rio is bound to offer.</p><p>They thought about it, thought about leading her past the rows of tables, past the bar and through the double door and letting her dress drop in the middle of whatever room they land in. The way Agatha’s breath hitches at the barest brush of Rio’s fingers along her wrist whenever they reach out tells them she’s thought about it too.</p><p>However the thought of Agatha slowly coming undone as the night wears on, the thought of it all coming crashing heavy and hungry as soon as they stumble through the door later, that is the only thing keeping Rio right where they are.</p><p>“How is your wine my love?” Rio asks, stretching back into the seat, Agatha to their left, close enough to touch.</p><p>Agatha looks out the corner of her eye, swallowing hard as Rio drags their foot up her calf before leaning forward again. “Fine.”</p><p>Rio pouts as they reach a hand out to tug a strand of hair that has slipped free from Agatha’s clasp behind her ear, fingers lingering on her neck as they do. “Just fine?”</p><p>“I need-” Agatha pauses as Rio’s fingers now make their way down the exposed skin on her back, slow and careful, feeling the heat of her against their fingertips. Their other hand wraps around the beer in front of them before they take a sip as they wait.</p><p>“What do you need?” Rio smirks, removing their hand and placing it back on Agatha’s thigh under the table and leaning back again.</p><p>Agatha shuffles in her seat, eyes moving to focus on anything but the exposed skin of Rio’s chest or the knowing cocky grin they have had since their hand first wandered under the table. “You said you had something you wanted to tell me, let's talk about that.”</p><p>Rio had been having too much fun watching the blush spread across Agatha’s cheeks and her knuckles turning white as she gripped the wine glass that it took a second for them to even remember what she meant.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio sits straighter, thumb idly rubbing soft circles against the fabric of Agatha’s dress. “I just don’t want ‘she/her’ pronouns being used at all anymore.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha turns fully to face them, her own hand coming to cover Rio’s on her thigh. “Okay love.”</p><p>It really is that easy. Rio gets to watch as Agatha’s eyes soften as she looks at them, giving them space to explain more if they want but really what else is there to say when she makes it that easy to just be.</p><p>They’d much rather focus on making sure this beautiful woman in front of them unravels completely just for them. That and being a pain in her ass.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio leans forward, lips pressing against Agatha’s cheek, voice dropping so it’s just for her. “Oh and I would love for you to call me <i>daddy</i> later too.”</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha gasps, Rio’s chuckle vibrates against the shell of her ear as they move their hand higher up her thigh. “Behave!”</p><p>“I can’t help it,” Rio whispers against her, their fingers still moving. “Not when yo-”</p><p>It’s then that the waiter arrives with their main meal and they are snapped back into reality and Rio curses under their breath, pulling their hand back and watching as Agatha politely thanks the waiter.</p><p>When they are alone again Agatha stabs her fork into the plate and snaps her neck round. “I am absolutely not calling you that later or ever.”</p><p>Rio’s laugh rings out into the busyness of the restaurant. “Oh I know I just love watching you struggle my love.”</p><p>“Asshole,” Agatha rolls her eyes and focuses back on her food. “Next thing you’ll be asking me to beg and call you ‘sir’.”</p><p>Rio chokes. “And wou-”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Worth a shot.</p><p>This is usually how it goes, one of them teasing and one of them the poor victim of said teasing, usually Rio. But tonight they have managed to come out on top. Is it because Agatha is letting them have it? Yes. Does it still feel like a win to get to watch Agatha melt into whatever touch Rio gives and watch her lose her composure as the minutes pass? Absolutely.</p><p>Their plates are cleared and Rio watches as Agatha drums her fingers on the table, her impatience on getting the fuck out of there evident as she lets her eyes keep flicking to the clock above the bar.</p><p>“One more drink?” Rio asks, poking their tongue into their cheek when Agatha looks back at them.</p><p>“I was thinking dessert actually,” Agatha who looks smug as she watches Rio’s face drop.</p><p>The waiter starts approaching then, menu’s in hand. Rio grips Agatha’s thigh under the table, nails biting into the fabric as Agatha’s lips twitch into a smirk.</p><p>“Would you like the dessert menu?” The waiter asks with a smile.</p><p>Agatha hums, fingers reaching out. “I could g-”</p><p>“No thank you,” Rio blurts out, dragging their hand higher in warning as Agatha raises an eyebrow. “My desserts right here.”</p><p>Between the look of the waiter and Agatha closing her eyes and making herself smaller in the seat, Rio realises they said that out loud and very much not in their head.</p><p>When the waiter leaves, Agatha finally looks back at Rio and shakes her head. “You’re ridiculous.”</p><p>“And yet you’re still here,” Rio grins.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio has tortured her the entire ride home, gentle touches against her thigh as she topped up her lipstick, hushed whispers of want pressed against her neck as they were driven home. If she doesn’t make it through that door before her lips are against Rio’s well fucking sue her.</p><p>Keeping her hands to herself throughout dinner was near impossible and she was far too close to dragging the smug little shit that sat beside her by the shirt collar to the bathroom so they could eat their fucking words.</p><p>But she somehow held composure.</p><p>“Thank you so much,” Agatha croaks, leaning across to hand the driver a twenty dollar bill as they both step out of the cab. Rio’s hand floats to Agatha’s waist instantly as they make their way towards the front door.</p><p>No words are being shared but the laboured breathing and simultaneous glances tells Agatha all she needs to know.</p><p>She lets Rio take the lead as they pull her through the door, there’s no rush as Rio moves towards the bedroom, Agatha following behind them. She can’t help but smile, wondering what awaits her tonight.</p><p>Rio fills the silence as soon as they step into the bedroom, wrapping their arms round Agatha’s waist and leaning into her.</p><p>“You, mi amor, are absolutely fucking insane,” Rio hums, it almost comes out like a low growl and the sound sends Agatha reeling. “How dare you look so fucking incredible, torturing me at dinner knowing I had to wait to have you. To have what’s mine.”</p><p>Agatha chuckles breathlessly, pressing her chest into theirs as they push a strand of her hair that’s fallen loose behind her ear. “Same goes for you and that smirk you’ve been wearing all evening didn’t help me out either.”</p><p>Rio uses their spare hand to tilt her neck to the side, pressing their lips lightly against her. Their hands make their way back to her hips, using their leverage to spin her round so she faces away from them. Agatha doesn’t know how but their lips stay exactly where they are, as their hands squeeze tightly on her hips.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting all night to see your hair down,” they whisper as Agatha feels her hair cascade down her bare back as Rio frees it from the brown plastic keeping it up.</p><p>“<i>Jesus fuck,</i>” Rio audibly moans as her hair finally shakes free. “My god baby, this is. Fuck you are so fucking beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha gasps as Rio runs their hands through her hair, listening as they exhale behind her.</p><p>“Mmm, so you forgive me for cutting it a little shorter then?” Agatha teases as Rio’s hands come up to her shoulders.</p><p>“Of course I do, I was worried because I love your hair so much but I cannot put into words how gorgeous you look mi vida, how much I need you to see that.”</p><p>“You tell me everyday,” Agatha laughs softly, as Rio’s lips begin to press into her back.</p><p>Rio’s breath hums against her skin as they chuckle. “And I’ll never fucking stop.”</p><p>The further down Rio travels, the harsher the kisses get, teeth nipping lightly like Rio is staking their claim. Agatha’s breath continues to hitch rapidly, overwhelmed by the sensation on her lower back, she gasps when Rio growls deeply in frustration because her dress is stopping them from travelling any further.</p><p>Rio pulls their lips back, returning their rough hands to the nap of Agatha’s neck and pulling the ties between their fingers.</p><p>“As fucking incredible and beautiful as it makes you look, this has been in my way for long enough,” Rio grits, pulling the ties and letting Agatha’s dress drop completely too the floor.</p><p>It should be awkward, the dress should take time to take off but it fits Agatha and her curves so perfectly that it just falls off her. The cool air against her bare skin shocks another moan out of her as she feels Rio’s touch leave her completely.</p><p>She turns to see Rio standing there, their jaw practically hitting the floor as Agatha steps away from her dress. “Fucking hell baby, you are absolutely fucking insane.”</p><p>Agatha chuckles softly as she pushes Rio’s blazer off their shoulders as their eyes roam down her figure as Rio tugs her gently towards the bed. Rio perches on the edge and Agatha can’t help but blush as Rio’s hands are quickly on her hips pulling her on top of them as they lean back. Agatha squeals as she moves which only causes Rio to grip her tighter.</p><p>She can’t wait any longer, and needs to feel their lips against hers. “Please,” she whimpers before pressing her red stained lips against their cracked ones. Rio’s tongue waits no time in begging for entrance and Agatha could never refuse. It doesn’t take long before she can feel Rio’s hips thrusting up against her core, the bulge hitting her every time. The action makes her smirk, knowing that they are just as desperate for more as she is.</p><p>In a split second decision she decides to take the lead, pulling back from Rio and staring at the red lipstick smeared lightly around their mouth. She can’t believe how endearing she finds it, poking her tongue in her cheek as they wipe it away. She leans back down, pushing the already half-opened shirt even further, hands gripping the fabric as she lightly grinds against that all too familiar bulge. She lets her hands roam over their chest as Rio’s body reacts to her movements. The tape on their chest has pushed their confidence sky high that when Agatha runs her hands over the strips Rio rolls their eyes back.</p><p>“Shit you feel good,” Agatha moans, the lace fabric barrier becoming more useless with every thrust. “Fuck baby.”</p><p>As she grinds she presses her lips against Rio’s chest, contracting in on herself in order to reach, there is still enough lipstick on her lips that it transfers to their chest, leaving a path of red kiss marks as she travels down. She thanks herself for not caring about buying a non-transferable one when she looks at the mess she’s created and she knows how badly Rio loves it when Agatha leaves her mark.</p><p>She lets herself get lost in the moment, tipping her head back as she lets the sensations race down her spine. Rio hands reach out for her hips again, grabbing them tight as they pant breathlessly below her. The edge comes closer, catching her off guard as she chases the unexpected high. Rio must catch onto this as they grind harder, working their hips against that soaked black bit of lace.</p><p>“Shit shit shit,” Rio chants from below her. “Agatha fuck I’m gonna come.”</p><p>“Al- Already?” she tries to tease, moaning as a small orgasm crashes into her.</p><p>She expects a snarky remark from Rio but once her high has washed over she spots that familiar look on their face, eyes half closed, nose scrunching as they work themselves through an orgasm of their own. Agatha’s brain snaps back into action as she watches them begin to come back into the moment. She moves away from straddling Rio who whines at the loss of contact against their bulge.</p><p>Agatha rips the zipper down, Rio’s cock frees instantly at her touch and she wastes no time pushing it to the back of her throat before Rio can catch onto her movements still coming back down from their high.</p><p>The first gag startles Rio back into reality, sitting up rapidly leaning back against their elbows. “Fuck cariño, not wasting any time are you?”</p><p>They run a hand through their hair as they watch Agatha let their cock hit the back of her mouth. As she moves, she reaches her hands down to pull Rio’s trousers all the way off, leaving them in their shirt and strapless boxers. It’s a sight that is going to make her orgasm come flooding through her again if she doesn’t look away. So she does, she peels her eyes away, letting them roll to the back of her head as Rio begins to meet her movements with their hips.</p><p>“Aw, eyes up here mi amor, let me see you with my cock in your mouth,” Rio teases, their voice struggling to gain complete composure.</p><p>Rio’s words only end up throwing her closer to the edge, she knew she was desperate but this is a whole new level for her, the way she is falling so close for the second time without a single touch. However, she quickly learns that Rio is close too as their hands reach out to grab her hair, stopping any movement she is giving as they always do when they find themselves lost in the moment. The sensations are overwhelming as she squeezes her legs together attempting to ignore the inevitable. But before she can even think about falling into the new wave of pleasure, rough hands come to grip her shoulders, pulling her off their dick gently before throwing her onto her back.</p><p>The abrupt action causes a whimper to escape her throat, a mixture of the need to be touched and at the shock of Rio taking the control into their own hands. A whimper that is too loud to be avoided by Rio.</p><p>“Mhm desperate are we?” Rio purrs from above her, leaning down to place a light kiss against her forehead. They’ve tossed their shirt off, Agatha lets herself look now, distracted from what was almost her second untouched orgasm. She trails her eyes down their toned torso, the red lipstick still clinging to sweaty skin. They look so fucking good and Agatha can tell from the darkness in their eyes and the confidence dripping in their tone that they feel good too.</p><p>And when they’re like this? Oh Agatha is simply putty in their hands.</p><p>She can feel the way her legs are already shaking, pushed apart by Rio’s knees as they sit back on their heels. She needs their hands on her, needs them now before she fucking explodes. She’s not going to beg because she knows Rio needs her just as much as she needs them.</p><p>Rio just stares at her, placing a firm grip onto her thighs to stop them from trying to clamp shut. “God look at you, soaking, all for me isn’t it?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah it is. Only for you,” Agatha replies breathlessly. She wants to reach down, wants to slip her hands past that lace barrier and touch herself but from the way Rio’s been tonight she knows they’ll make her get herself off whilst they watch and she needs more than that right now.</p><p>Rio hums in response, sliding their hands further up her thighs until their fingers curl underneath the lace waistband. The lightest touches against her skin send shocks straight to her core.</p><p>
<i>Okay fine maybe she will beg.</i>
</p><p>“Please,” Agatha moans weakly and Rio pulls her lace underwear off, finally leaving her completely bare. “Please baby, <i>please</i>.”</p><p>And those words seem to be all Rio wanted to hear. They waste no more time, grabbing a spare pillow from behind Agatha before returning to look at her. Agatha doesn’t need instructed, her hips lifting up subconsciously as they tuck the memory foam beneath her.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio purrs before running their fingers through her soaked cunt. “Fuck Agatha, oh my god, you’ve been like this since we got in the door haven’t you?”</p><p>The praise has Agatha eyes rolling back, drunk on the praise and how turned on she is. They run their soaked fingers over their length before placing their hands at either side of her head, letting the tip rest against her.</p><p>“Since I came back from my hair appointment, let alone all night.”</p><p>“Think you can take it without my fingers first?” Rio asks, thrusting their hips to press the head inside of her.</p><p>The stretch is instant, it’s perfect. “Fuck, yea- yeah I can.”</p><p>“That’s my girl,” they reply, working their length deeper inside of her. “Fuck I can’t tell you how many times I thought about having you like this when we were at dinner.”</p><p>Agatha moans loudly in response, the confirmation that Rio is just as needy as she is rings repeatedly in her ears.</p><p>“By the way you sound right now, I take it you’ve been thinking about it too,” Rio chuckles breathlessly.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth is dry, the moans leaving her mouth barely make a sound as Rio picks up their pace. Her brain eventually plays catch up as she grabs hold of her calves, pulling them back so Rio has perfect access. Rio notices the movement instantly, slamming their hips against her own. She feels so fucking full, exactly what she wanted. Rio always did that, always gave her what she needed. She feels her full body shake as Rio grabs onto her wrist, pulling it down and prompting her to touch her clit.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha groans, that added sensation being exactly what she needs. Rio was fucking her like their life depended on it and she was loving every second. She feels more wanted and needed every time they fuck and Agatha has the feeling that will never change.</p><p>“Fuck baby, I love it when you’re loud for me, good girl,” Rio moans, there’s no sign of struggle coming from them yet and Agatha knows just how to get to them.</p><p>“Mmm you’re so fucking big, good boy that’s it, fuck me like that,” she moans the words of praise towards them between thrusts.</p><p>Instantly Rio’s hips are faltering as they desperately attempt to keep the harsh pace they set but the stuttering movements are working perfectly for Agatha as it threatens to pull her back to the edge again. It’s almost perfect, almost everything she could want as she stares into those deep brown eyes above her, the chain she bought for them dangling in her face like a taunt.</p><p>Thoughts flood her mind about how Rio’s confidence is only growing, how good they feel in themselves and how fucking good they looked tonight. She isn’t even sure she’s thinking properly when she reaches out for Rio’s wrist, grabbing it and bringing their hand to her throat.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widen as they catch onto the movement, the unspoken words of ‘is this okay’ hanging in the air from both of them. Agatha takes the lead, clamping Rio’s hand against her skin. She swears Rio’s eyes almost sparkle when they realise that Agatha wants this, taking the queue to choke her perfectly. The change has caused Rio to pick up their pace again, gaining their rhythm back.</p><p>“Jesus christ you are fucking perfect,” Rio chokes as Agatha’s eyes roll into the back of her head.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha croaks, the pressure on her throat is perfect, better than she could have ever imagined it. “There. Fuck. Right there.”</p><p>And because Rio knows exactly how Agatha’s body reacts when she’s close, they know what to do. They thrust into her completely, filling her and stretching her out perfectly. They squeeze just that little bit tighter and there’s no warning from Agatha’s body as her orgasm crashes through her. Her legs slamming against Rio’s body as they work her through it, her body doesn’t let up, it doesn’t stop as Rio hits perfectly against the right spots inside of her whilst saying how much they love her as she contracts around them.</p><p>Her hands slam against their back, nails digging into tanned flesh with Rio’s forehead resting against hers as she slowly comes down from her high. She had been so caught up in the way her orgasms had ripped through her that she hadn’t realised the mess she’d made.</p><p>Rio pulls back slowly, Agatha still reeling, clit pulsing hard between her legs as she sits up on her elbows to look at them. Her breathing is almost returning to normal when she locks eyes with them but that’s ruined when she sees Rio’s soaking lower torso and thighs her breathing is suddenly quickening again.</p><p>Turns out Rio had already realised exactly what had been happening, running their fingers over their right thigh before bringing it up to their lips. The deep moan that they let out when they taste her off their fingers sends Agatha spiralling all over again, the want soaring through her body.</p><p>“Need more,” Rio groans. “Now.”</p><p>Oh fuck.</p><p>“Where do you want me, pretty boy?” Agatha grins.</p><p>Rio crawls over to lay beside her, staring at the ceiling. “Up here? Please?” Rio whispers, smirk plastering their face.</p><p>Agatha isn’t sure her legs will be able to hold her for long as she eventually sits up onto her knees. “Baby I don’t know if I can hold my own weight, you’ve ruined me,” she laughs, looking down to Rio who is eagerly waiting to taste her.</p><p>“I don’t fucking care, I’ll take it all. <i>Please</i> I want to feel you drip down my face,” Rio whimpers, the smirk wiped from their face as the desperation takes over.</p><p>So Agatha does, she moves one leg over to the other side of their face and instantly feels their hot breath against her. She knows it won’t be long until she’s unravelling all over again for them and she wouldn’t have it any other way. She can hear Rio whimpering beneath her, for how badly they want her, they truly never want anything more than to take care of her. She tilts her head down, locking eyes with them as they plead to taste her and who is she to deny them of anything they want.</p><p>Before she gets the chance to lower herself down, she feels those rough hands on her hips again pulling her towards their mouth. “Fuck,” she hisses as their tongue wraps round her sensitive clit.</p><p>With the little composure she has left, she rocks her hips back and forward, coating Rio’s face in her mess just like they had asked for. The sensation of coming undone against Rio’s tongue is one she is becoming incredibly familiar with. Rio truly could never get enough of her and Agatha could never get enough of them. This is something she would’ve dreamed of, convinced she didn’t deserve to have sex that held such want, love and passion. But all this with Rio? Yeah this was hers for the taking.</p><p>She lets herself get lost in the overstimulation. Head thrown back as she continues to grind against Rio’s face, occasionally lifting herself up to let Rio steal a breath but every time she does, their hands pull her right back down. Every swirl of Rio’s tongue, every nip of their teeth, every squeeze of their hands throws Agatha back into that hazy state. Her eyes begin to cloud over, broken moans tearing from her lungs as she comes for the third time. She notices it this time, feels it, the snap of release as she squirts directly into Rio’s mouth, who laps it up like it’s the last drink they’ll ever have.</p><p>“<i>Fuck fuck fuck</i>” she chants, eventually peeling herself away from Rio’s face when she realises she physically does not have another one in her.</p><p>She looks down at Rio, stupid grin back on their face as they lie there completely soaked. She wonders if Rio wants her to get them off now, but as soon as Agatha makes her way down between their legs she realises that they’ve finished as many times as her if not more.</p><p>“God I love you,” she sighs, as she lies back down into Rio’s arms.</p><p>Rio places a kiss to the side of her head. “And me you, you’re everything.”</p><p>They lie there in silence, letting their heart rates settle fully wrapped up within their own bubble. Agatha can physically feel the love between them. If someone had told Agatha a year ago that she would have feelings for a client of hers she would have laughed in their face, but if you told her that she would be so in love with them that she felt like she truly deserved this love? She would’ve cried, unable to believe that someone like her was deserving of a love like Rio Vidal’s.</p><p>—</p><p>Eventually they wind up in the spare room, showers taken and fresh pajamas on. Neither of them wanted to change the sheets nor did they want to fall asleep in soaking wet ones. So Rio had suggested they sleep here, just for one night.</p><p>It is weird settling into a new room, even if it is just for the night, but Rio knew they could feel like they are at home no matter where they are as long as they have Agatha right beside them.</p><p>“M’ tired,” Agatha whispers beside them, pulling the covers right up to under their chins.</p><p>Rio laughs lightly. “I know baby, go sleep.”</p><p>Agatha sighs contently. “Long lie?”</p><p>“Mmm I’ve got an appointment at ten,” Rio says which gets a tired groan from their girlfriend. “But, I promise I’ll come right back to bed when I’m done okay?”</p><p>“Fine, appointment for what?” Agatha asks lazily, the appointment clearly having peaked her interest.</p><p>Rio presses a kiss to her forehead. “You’ll see, all in due course mi amor.”</p><p>That seems to do the trick and Rio watches as she falls asleep, her lips pulled up into the smallest smile. And Rio can’t help but think about how fucking lucky they are.</p>

<p>The white leather box weighs heavy in their hands as they hold it firmly, it’s spent the past few weeks in the food cupboard which Agatha would never open, unlike Rio’s underwear drawer. It is perfect, all the worries Rio had held towards it vanish, they just had to work up the courage to show Agatha now.</p><p><i>The colours stare back at Rio as they check their notes for the one hundredth time to make sure they’d gotten it right.</i></p><p><i>“And I can definitely add more in the future if I need to?” Rio asked the associate who had been extremely patient with them throughout this entire process, reassuring all their anxieties.</i></p><p><i>The woman offers them a warm smile. “Of course, I can email you a copy of the sketches we looked at earlier so that when the time comes to make the additions we know exactly what we’re going to do with it.”</i></p><p><i>Rio exhales. This was it, no going back with their decision now. They point to the palest blue, in the fourth block along, this is the perfect one.</i></p><p><i>“Okay,” the associate responds. “I’ve already made up the base with the measurements you sent across to me last month so if you want to come back this evening I can have it finished for you?”</i></p><p><i>Already? God. Sure this had been a good idea but Rio thought they would at least have a month or so till it was in their hands but that’s what they got when they were paying such a price for it. </i></p><p>Rio exhales a warm feeling settling in their chest as they push the box back behind the cereal boxes. They didn’t know when the moment would arise to give it to Agatha but when it did, they felt ready.</p><p>It wasn’t anything significant but more of a reminder that Rio loved her more than anything and that the important things from her past deserved a space in their future together too.</p><p>—</p><p>Date nights are common for them, both of them regularly making the efforts to plan nights in and out for the other. Nights where they were fully with each other, no work chat, no phones, just the two of them fully immersed in the other's company. Trips to bars, the animal sanctuary to see Scratchy or pizza and movie nights. Agatha didn’t care what they were doing as long as they were doing it together.</p><p>Tonight is one of those nights Agatha has planned, she’s meant to be going round to Rio’s for a quiet night in with pizza, wine and beer as they catch up on their favourite show. It is a quiet celebration for them both, a year since their first session since their lives changed for the good. But she just received an extremely exciting text that has her practically kicking her feet as she waits for Rio to pick up the phone.</p><p>“Hi baby, what’s up?” Rio answers after the third ring, the husk in their voice evident from working out.</p><p>The tone makes Agatha blush, she thinks about their toned abs, mentally running her hands over them as she rides them, wait fuck no she is calling for a non-horny reason for once.</p><p>She clears her throat. “You know how we’re meant to be staying in tonight for pizza and catching up on that murder mystery show, well I just received a very interesting text that might encourage us to go out instead?”</p><p>Rio laughs. “Mhm go on? What could be more interesting than seeing if that woman is actually dead or if she was faking it all along?”</p><p>“Okay so,” Agatha begins, attempting to mentally prepare Rio for the word vomit of information she is about to give them. “Jen text me about eight minutes ago telling me that the board have pulled all funding from Hela’s clinic and that if she doesn’t raise a small fortune within the next week she is going to be shut the fuck down.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio responds, interest peaking.</p><p>“Yes oh, so she is holding an emergency fundraiser tonight and <i>unfortunately</i> our names were very much missed off the list, but Jen and Alice’s were very much included.”</p><p>Rio chuckles softly and Agatha can hear the beeping of the gym machines in the background. “And where are you going with this cariño?”</p><p>“Jen and Alice can’t go but Jen suggested that perhaps we go instead? We get in at the door by giving the hosts their names and then we go from there, show Hela what she’s missing as her life collapses on its ass.”</p><p>Rio goes silent, the steady panting of their breathing pulses in Agatha’s ears.</p><p>“Shit too soon?” Agatha asks, the guilt beginning to root within her chest for even suggesting such a thing.</p><p>“So to be clear, you want to pretend to be our friends at my ex wife’s ‘save the clinic’ fundraiser so we can flaunt our relationship in front of her whilst her life is currently falling apart? No wife and soon to be no business? That’s what you’re suggesting?” Rio asks, tone calm and collected.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha sighs.</p><p>“Oh fuck yeah I’m so down, god I cannot wait to see her miserable fucking face,” Rio laughs.</p><p><i>Thank fuck for that.</i></p><p>Agatha laughs. “Fuck yeah that’s the spirit. I’ll pick you up at five okay? Wear your sexiest suit.”</p><p>“Perfect, see you then mi amor, I love you.”</p><p>“Mhm I love you,” Agatha adds before hanging up the phone.</p><p>Oh this is going to be a night to remember.</p><p>—-</p><p>The walk to the function room is long, it’s the room furthest away possible from the front door and the walk isn’t doing anything to calm Rio’s nerves. Sure at first it seemed like a great idea. They’d gotten dressed into their best navy two piece suit, Renee Rapp blasting on the Alexa’s whilst they drank a beer to settle their nerves whilst they waited for Agatha and they felt so good.</p><p>The beer hit them quickly, providing them with a light buzz by the time Agatha had come to pick them up. She looked fucking incredible, sure they’d only seen her sitting in the car but as soon as they parked up and stepped out, Rio’s jaw is on the floor. A suede brown leather three piece suite with her blonde hair freshly blown out over her shoulders. At least if the night ended up being horrible they could always end up dragging her to a fancy hotel bathroom.</p><p>“Ready?” Agatha turns to them, squeezing their hand lightly as they walk up to the hosts at the door.</p><p>Rio nods, unsure if they were truly ready to come face to face with Hela. The last time they attended one of these events was when everything was going wrong for them, Hela hated them and they were sure Agatha did too. Events like this only held bad memories for Rio, ‘put up and shut up’ was a phrase they heard all too often in this space but they knew things like this were also occasionally important to Agatha so they were going to make the effort.</p><p>The bouncer raises an eyebrow in their direction. “Names?”</p><p>Agatha clears her throat. “Jennifer Kale,” she points to herself. “And Alice Wu.”</p><p>Rio struggles to keep a straight face, watching as her girlfriend slips into a facade so easily. They should be concerned but they are instead really fucking entertained. The man scans the list in front of him before pushing the door open and motioning them through.</p><p>Agatha drags Rio in and they immediately beeline for the bar. The music is loud, too loud for this type of event and Rio takes in the tacky table and window decorations that scream Hela as they walk by.</p><p>“Oh so not only do we have fake personas for the night, we also have accents?” Rio teases as they wait at the bar.</p><p>“No,” Agatha scoffs. “That was just for fun, most people here will know exactly who I am and that I am certainly not Jennifer Kale.”</p><p>They grab a bottle of wine and two beers for themselves before heading over to the table, even more delighted to find out that it is an open bar for the evening. Rio has learned that Agatha and alcohol equals chaos and they can only hope that’s exactly what they’re going to witness tonight.</p><p>Free food, free alcohol and the woman they are head over heels for all in the same place, impossible to feel anything but amazing right? But Rio cannot help the anxiety settling in their chest as they scan the room for any sign of Hela. They recognise the occasional investor or work colleague but Hela is absolutely nowhere to be seen and they’re convinced that they will not be able to shake this level of anxiety until they have eyes on her to make sure she won’t make her way in their direction.</p><p>“... you listening to me?” Agatha prompts, poking them on the thigh.</p><p>She’s clearly noticing that Rio is already mentally checked out and this causes her to squeeze their thigh lightly in reassurance.</p><p>“Hey handsome look at me,” Agatha says in a soft voice, one that’s reserved just for Rio. “If at any point you don’t want to be here, you say the words and we’re outta here. No questions asked, okay?”</p><p>Rio nods. “I do, I want to be here but I can’t settle until I know where <i>she</i> is.”</p><p>Agatha smiles in realisation. “There, white dress in the corner table to the left? See her?”</p><p>Rio narrows their eyes, spotting the bleach blonde woman sitting in the corner. She looks like hell, hair flung into a tight messy bun, less makeup than Rio is used to and- oh and a fucking brunette with her arm slung over Hela’s shoulder. They let the realisation settle in their mind, sure it was stupid to think that Hela wouldn’t move on from them but the realisation that perhaps another person is going to suffer under her control the way they did sucked.</p><p>“New girlfriend you think?” Rio offers as they twist the cap off their beer.</p><p>Agatha hums. “Probably some rebound fling, poor girl.”</p><p>“Let’s show them what a real relationships like,” Rio smirks, deciding that they have never been more happy or content with their life and who can blame them for wanting to flaunt that to the rest of the world and if that includes flaunting it in front of their ex wife, well so be it.</p><p>Rio’s response causes Agatha to place a kiss against their cheek before pulling away and smirking at them. “Oh I am about to be insufferable all evening.”</p><p>“Aren’t you always?” Rio teases.</p><p>“And yet I never see any complaints from you,” Agatha responds, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>They eventually fall into awkward chatter with the rest of the members of their table, Agatha does most of the talking which Rio is perfectly fine with as they eat their pasta. Before they know it, Agatha is a bottle of wine deep and sitting on their knees, arms slung round their neck as they wait for their dessert.</p><p>“Just remember and tell me if it’s too much,” Agatha whispers into their ear.</p><p>“Never with you.”</p><p>“Oh come on we should go speak to Ralph, I need to ask him if he’s renewing his sponsorship for my clinic,” Agatha suggests, pushing herself off from Rio’s lap. “Cmon, lets go.”</p><p>Rio just stares back at her.</p><p>“Rio? Come with me? Please?” Agatha blinks back at them.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Agatha actually <i>wants</i> them to go over with her. Okay sure they could do that, slip back into the part of the doting partner whilst Agatha talks business.</p><p>Rio takes her hand, following her through the crowd till they approach the bald man leaning against the wall in a suit that is absolutely far too small for him.</p><p>“Ralph,” Agatha nods, pulling Rio to stand beside her placing an arm of familiarity round their hip.</p><p>The man turns round and looks them both up and down slowly before locking eyes with Agatha. “Dr Harkness, long time no see huh? And who is this? No Wanda tonight?”</p><p>“Wanda?” Agatha laughs. “Does it look like that insufferable redheaded bitch is a part of my life anymore?”</p><p>Rio blushes, they forgot that the attention would be drawn to them pretty quickly as these people were used to seeing them by Hela’s side not Agatha’s. But thankfully Agatha introduces Rio as quickly as she can before moving into the conversation about money with the bald man. They let themselves dissociate, falling back into that almost forgotten way of being physically in the room but not mentally. They don’t think of anything specifically when they’re switching off, just a state of nothing but Agatha’s arm doesn’t leave their side once and they are occasionally brought back into the moment with a small squeeze on their back.</p><p>“...Rio works in construction actually if you’re still looking for advice Ralph, don’t you?” Agatha says softly, the sound of their name pulls them right back into the moment.</p><p>Rio nods, that state of nothingness still clouds their brain. Why would Agatha want them to talk right now, Hela never wanted them to talk. This wasn’t their space to speak in, this was hers.</p><p>“Baby, Ralph is looking for advice on ways to make his house more accessible for his disabled nephew, you wanna talk to him about it? Maybe make some suggestions, you know way more about this than me,” Agatha suggests, her tone soft and reassuring.</p><p>It’s here that they are firmly reminded that Agatha is not Hela. Sure they knew that but being back in a space that taunted them with anxiety is an easy thing to slip into but Agatha wanted them to talk, wanted them to mix with the same people she is mixing with. This place is Agatha’s and she knows how to navigate all this but she wants Rio to navigate it with her. As an equal not a less than.</p><p>And that’s how Agatha makes them feel, just as important as her.</p><p>They let the realisation settle before pulling the beer bottle to their lips and clearing their throat. “Sure yeah, do you wanna tell me more about the specifics and I can work out some suggestions?” Rio offers confidently.</p><p>And with that firm hold against their back and the reminder that these new things are not going to slip back into the old ones, Rio spends the next forty five minutes helping the bald man make plans for his nephew and they enjoy it. Agatha sits and listens to their every word, looking at them like they hung the stars. Sure they’re here to piss off their ex wife but it’s healing a small part of them they didn’t realise needed healing.</p><p>Time passes and eventually Ralph excuses himself to go and speak to someone else and Agatha and Rio head back to the bar for more free drinks. The speeches begin and although they have absolutely no intention of listening to a single thing Hela has to say, Rio can’t help but smile at how absolutely miserable she sounds. They notice Agatha staring at them, the way she does when she’s thinking about them.</p><p>“You okay cariño?” Rio suggests, placing a warm hand onto her thigh.</p><p>Agatha smirks back at them, oh they should’ve known she was up to something.</p><p>“This is the wine talking but what if you kissed me right now, I accidentally knock a glass off the bar top and everyone has to stop looking at Hela to look at us instead?” she laughs, she is clearly aware of how ridiculous she sounds but this is exactly why Rio is in love with her.</p><p>“You are fucking insane,” Rio laughs. “Fine, but only if my back faces everyone so I don’t have to see anyone’s reactions.”</p><p>“Deal and then can we go home, this shit is so fucking boring.”</p><p>Rio smirks back at her, pulling her in quickly by the loop on her trousers. They don’t overthink the situation and how much anxiety it would bring them if they weren’t currently fuelled by beer and their hate for Hela. Agatha leans in, brushing her lips softly against Rio’s before gently pushing her tongue for entrance, something that Rio will never deny.</p><p>And suddenly there’s silence.</p><p>No quiet clattering of glasses against plates or forks and knives as people eat dessert.</p><p>No mindless business conversations in a world where Rio doesn’t belong.</p><p>No fucking irritatingly boring ex-wife speech pounding in their ears.</p><p>Just Agatha and her world where Rio absolutely belongs.</p><p>And then there’s the glass.</p><p>Rio feels the way Agatha moves them slowly, neither of them pulling away from the other and before they can, the shattering glass echoes in their ears and the murmurs of ‘oh my god’ ‘who was that’ and the sensation of hundreds of eyes burn into their backs.</p><p>But Rio can’t help but smirk. Let them stare, let Hela see them together, let them all see what it’s like to be loved by Agatha Harkness.</p><p>They don’t pull away, they kiss Agatha harder as Hela taps the microphone as if to say ‘pay attention to me’ and Rio loves every single second of it. Eventually Agatha pulls back, the darkness in her eyes unmissable. Oh tonight is only going to get better for Rio.</p><p>They half listen as Hela wraps up her speech, encouraging everyone to pay and blah blah but the only thing they’re focused on is Agatha in that waistcoat as they make a silent bet in their head about how long it will take before it’s on the floor when they get back to theirs. A minute is probably pushing it.</p><p>As they walk towards the door, arms linked together, desperate to be somewhere where they can be closer to each other, they notice Hela and the brunette standing by the door.</p><p>Agatha squeezes Rio’s bicep for reassurance as they tilt their chin that little bit higher. They have no intention of looking at either of them, let alone speaking to them.</p><p>“Oh my fucking god Hela, you have to stop trying to control everything,” the brunette whisper shouts, pointing at Hela. “And stop telling me what to do, I’m meant to be your girlfriend not your fucking butler.”</p><p>Rio can’t help but whistle as they walk past them. “Damn, it’s good to see you haven’t changed Hela.”</p><p>They smirk, locking eyes with the brunette and offering them a sympathetic ‘good luck she’s insane’ before pushing through the double door.</p><p>“Bitch,” Agatha throws over her shoulder as the wood slams shut behind them.</p><p>As the door slams, they both exhale at the same time, the weight of the evening and all the socialising finally disappearing. Rio can’t help but think that was the closure they really needed.</p><p>Agatha is searching in her bag, standing outside the door as if she has forgotten something which confuses Rio as they don’t remember her taking anything from her bag in the first place. “Baby you okay?”</p><p>Agatha groans. “Yes, fine, let me just put this envelope in the donation box.”</p><p>Now why the fuck is Agatha donating anything to their ex-wife?</p><p>“Oh,” Rio replies, heart sinking just a little. “What for?”</p><p>Agatha must pick up on Rio’s disappointment as she throws the envelope into the slot before grabbing their hand and dragging them towards the exit.</p><p>“Alice’s idea actually,” Agatha begins. “Sixty-nine dollars in monopoly money.”</p><p>“You are kidding,” Rio laughs, palming their forehead in despair. “Seriously?”</p><p>“Oh so serious,” Agatha replies. “I am not giving her any money, hell I even think the monopoly money is a waste on her. And just to wind her up that little bit further I signed the donation slip from Agatha and Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“God I love you so much,” Rio replies, attempting to hide how turned on such an immature thing made them.</p><p>Agatha suddenly walks faster. “How much?”</p><p>“I’m sure you’re about to find out,” Rio replies, sliding their hand over the back of her trousers.</p><p>—</p><p>Since their anniversary night things have been shifting in all the right ways, good day after good day. However Agatha realises not all days can be perfect.</p><p>It’s another night where Agatha should be going ‘home’, should have turned right at the last turning, should be pulling into her own driveway right about now. Yet her car crawls towards Rio’s place, an ease instantly settling in her chest the closer she gets. A new client session today being one that hit a bit too close to her own past. Her jaw has been clenched tight as she thought of the memories that have been threatening to flood her thoughts since the session ended.</p><p>It’s a lot.</p><p>It’s been sometime since she last felt the heaviness of the loss, the pain, the emptiness. But today it felt too easy to slip back into the darkness of it all. So it seems subconsciously she has been pulled towards the only thing that brings her more than all of that. The one thing that brings a warmth to the ache in her bones even on her worst days.</p><p><i>Rio.</i></p><p>As she comes to a stop outside Rio’s, the first thing she sees is Rio knee deep in a new patch of dirt, their hair pulled back, sleeves pushed up to their elbows. She watches as light rain settles against the fabric of their sweater but Rio doesn’t flinch, hands still working and Agatha can feel the heaviness of the day start to fade into a dull thud in her chest.</p><p>Rio doesn’t startle when the car door clicks closed, doesn’t turn when Agatha’s shoes crunch against the gravel. It isn’t until Agatha is crouching next to them that they turn, wide eyed and whatever tool they are using comes up as a makeshift weapon.</p><p>Agatha bites her cheek to stop the laugh that threatens to escape her throat. “Really?”</p><p>“You scared the shit out of me!” Rio shouts as they rip the gloves off their hands and take their airpods out. Then those wide eyes happen again as they look at what they are doing and back at Agatha and their lips turn down. “This was supposed to be a surprise.”</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha replies, reaching out to wipe the smear of dirt from Rio’s cheek. “You’re planting something for me?”</p><p>Rio cheeks tinge pink, chewing on their bottom lip as they nod lightly. “Azalea’s, I wanted you to feel like this-”</p><p>Agatha’s hand stills on Rio’s cheek. “Like what my love?”</p><p>“Like this is your home too,” Rio breathes out. “I-, I just want you to feel at home here.”</p><p>How does she even start with telling Rio that this is the first time she has ever felt at home anywhere? How does she tell them that she ended up here because it is the only home she ever wants to come back to?</p><p>“Did I say something wrong?” Rio asks, the panic setting in. Agatha can feel the warmth of tears landing on her cheeks and to Rio it could mean anything but the words just won’t come out. Rio’s voice is so soft as it breaks through the ringing in her ears. “Hey, look at me.”</p><p>Agatha tightens her jaw and shakes her head. The warmth of Rio’s palm on her cheek, the smell of dirt and fresh air hits her as Rio leans in. The rain starts to come down a little heavier, the cold droplets easing the burning against her cheeks. She knows the minute she opens her eyes that she will admit all of it and she isn’t sure if they are ready for all that just yet.</p><p>The old version of Agatha would have cut and run as soon as she felt the vulnerability threatening to slip out. The old her would have brushed it off and avoided it at all costs. But she isn’t that person anymore, she has finally found something solid and good. Something she does not ever want to run from. So she lets out a long breath, lets her eyes flutter open, let the tears drip down her chin as those brown eyes settle on hers and she lets out a weak chuckle as her hands come up to cover Rio’s.</p><p>“You’ve done everything right,” Agatha says quietly. “I don’t want to ever go back to a home that isn’t one that has you in it.”</p><p>Rio’s panic eases and their eyes soften, the grip on Agatha tightens as they let their forehead press against hers and she hears them exhale against her. When they pull back, they let their nose brush against hers. “Let’s get out of the rain.”</p><p>So Agatha does what she hopes she will get to do for a long time, she follows, their hand secure around her own as they lead her inside. She lets Rio help her out of the damp slacks and shirt that are clinging to her, lets them wrap her in the comfort of them as they help her into their boxers and an old shirt. She watches as they wipe the dirt streaks from her cheeks from where they had held her, gentle fingers pressing against her skin like they know when to handle her with care, like they just know this is exactly what she needs.</p><p>No one had ever handled her with care before. Like she could be something fragile. It hits her though that she doesn’t think she would have ever let anyone else this close.</p><p>“I’ve ordered us dinner, your favourite,” Rio breaks through her spiral, crouching in front of her on the bed. “Shall we go get comfy and you can tell me about your day?”</p><p>Agatha smiles softly, nodding as she gets up to follow Rio downstairs.</p><p>She lands on the sofa with a long drawn out sigh and feels the warmth of Rio wrapping around her as they settle beside her, pulling her into their chest as lips press against her head.</p><p>“Bad day?” Rio asks, fingers starting to trace along the skin of her arm.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha replies, relaxing into the touch.</p><p>Rio holds her a little tighter, like they are attempting to absorb everything she is feeling so she doesn't need to bare it alone. “Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>Agatha isn’t one to open up easily, sometimes it’s like pulling teeth trying to get the barest amount of vulnerability from her. Never wanting to be a burden even for things that she cannot control. However right now she wants to be free from the heaviness of it all.</p><p>“I had a new client start today, she lost a baby recently. She described the feeling of the loss in a way I could never really put into words. The session just hit really close to home and dragged up a lot of feelings I had tried to suppress. Her situation is almost identical to everything I went through,” Agatha lets out a stuttered breath, her tears seeping into Rio’s shirt as she talks. “She described the way her body no longer feels like her own, like more than just her baby died that day. How do you tell someone that you understand and tell them that it gets better dealing with that loss when you aren’t even sure it does?”</p><p>Rio listens quietly above her, fingers threading through Agatha’s hair. They had many conversations like this one in the late hours when everything was still but the darkness pulled out the memories you wanted to keep buried.</p><p>“That is a lot my love, what did you tell her?” Rio asks.</p><p>Agatha swallows, knowing exactly what Rio means, ‘what would you have needed someone to tell you back then’.</p><p>“I told her that the actions of other people shouldn’t ever keep her from finding herself again. That when you have a loss so devastating she doesn’t need to feel guilty for how long it takes her to do that. She is allowed to grieve and should never have to question how other people react to how she handles that grief,” Agatha lets her hand press into Rio’s stomach to help ground her. “Oh and that her husband is a piece of shit.”</p><p>Rio chuckles lightly, thumb coming up to wipe the tears from Agatha’s cheek, looking down at her with so much softness that Agatha feels herself ready to crack again.</p><p>“What are you feeling right now?”</p><p>“That’s the thing, if this had been a year ago it probably would have destroyed me. I would have drowned myself in wine, thrown things, let the anger consume me at how much I had to hurt and go through it alone,” Agatha sits up, eyes settling on Rio’s as she talks. “But I’m not alone Rio, I have you. I drove here instead and found you planting my favourite flowers. I came home to you. I felt so fucking overwhelmed with emotions and yet all of that dissipates the minute I am with you. You have made me want things I never thought I could have, given me things I never thought I deserved and you do it so easily.”</p><p>“Loving you is the easiest thing I have ever gotten to do,” Rio smiles softly, hands coming up to cup Agatha’s cheeks as they lean in. “This home has never just been mine, it’s always been ours. Getting to come home is the best part of my day because I know that these walls have and will only know love and that's because we have filled them with it. I want to be able to come home to you everyday.”</p><p>They stay like that for a moment, both their cheeks tear stained and the room still with the declarations. It’s Rio who finally breaks it.</p><p>“Stay?” They ask quietly. “For good I mean, I want you to.”</p><p>Agatha swallows hard, resting her forehead on Rio’s and letting out a quiet sob as she grips onto their shirt. “You really want that?”</p><p>Rio lets out a huffed laugh. “I haven’t wanted anything so bad in my life, cariño. Do you want that?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else,” Agatha whispers, feeling the warmth of Rio’s lips press to her cheek. “I’m ready to let go of my past and keep building this new life with you.”</p><p>“You don’t need to let go of all of it, there are parts of it that you can keep right here with you,” Rio says gently. “There is space here for you to keep those close to you and I don’t want you to ever feel like you need to let go of everything, not the parts that are important to you.”</p><p>Agatha pulls back slightly, brow furrowing in confusion. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Rio had mentioned never wanting to feel like they were crossing any lines when they bring up the baby Agatha lost but they also know that even though Agatha tries to hide the pain it’s something that she never got to really grieve because of everything else she went through back then. She never felt like she was allowed. Rio had made it clear they can’t have her believing that it still needs to be like that. So Agatha lets them talk.</p><p>“You lost her but that doesn’t mean you ever need to bury those memories, that is something that you get to keep close, something you love and will always love. Even if you didn’t feel like you could grieve back then, you never have to hide how it feels with me. I want you to feel like there is always room for us to talk about that part even if it hurts. I want you to be able to feel like you don’t ever have to let that go.”</p><p>“Those are just memories I have in here,” Agatha says sadly, fingers tapping against her chest. “I don’t have anything more than that.”</p><p>Rio sits up, slowly peeling away from her and making their way across the room. “I want you to have more than that, I want those memories to be able to live in this home, with you, with us. That happens by you getting to talk about that love you have for her even if she is gone. It happens by not burying it my love.” Rio pulls open the cupboard and slides the boxes around until their hand lands on a little white box. “And it happens by having something physical as a reminder too.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Agatha asks, her eyes trailing down to the box in Rio’s hand.</p><p>“It means I want you to have something that ties your past to the life we are going to build together,” Rio says softly, making their way back across the room and settling down beside Agatha again. “It means I want you to have something that reminds you of her because you never got to do that for yourself.”</p><p>Agatha looks at the box and then back at Rio. “I-, can I see?”</p><p>Rio opens it slowly, they watch as Agatha reaches out for it as soon as the light hits the stone and they let her take it. Agatha can feel them watch as fresh tears start to form as she takes the ring from the box and sits it in her palm.</p><p>“Is this her birthstone?” Agatha whispers, not able to tear her eyes away from it as she turns in her hand.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replies, shuffling closer so they can pull her into their chest again. “I thought it could be something you can carry with you, something you can keep close.”</p><p>Agatha slides the ring onto her finger, turning her head up and pressing her lips to Rio’s jaw. “It’s beautiful.”</p><p>Rio holds her like that, Agatha’s palm flat against their chest, only soft breathing filling the room as they just let the sentiment settle. Agatha can feel the soft thud of her heartbeat pressing against Rio as she finally calms in their arms.</p><p>Agatha listens as Rio explains that this hadn’t been their plan for the ring, for asking her to move in but sometimes there doesn’t need to be a plan, things just happen when they are supposed to.</p><p>Right now feels like this is exactly how it should have gone. With them both cracked open and the honesty of how much love they have for each other filling the room.</p><p>The walls are already threatening to crack with how much love already exists within them.</p><p>As the night winds down, comfortable silence has filled the house as they let everything settle. The tears stopped and were replaced with soft kisses and fingers tracing along skin until they both decided it was time to get some sleep. Still there is no space between them as Agatha lies with her head back against Rio’s chest as they tangle their fingers in her hair and whisper about how much they love her and can’t wait to get to have this every single night.</p><p>Agatha had spent most of the day feeling the darkness creeping through her bones, anxiety threatening to consume her but now as they lie in the stillness of the night she feels lighter and content. The room filling with gentle love not just from Rio but from herself. The kind of love she never thought herself capable of yet now it feels like the kind she will only ever know and be able to give.</p><p>She twists the ring on her finger, already finding comfort in how it feels like more than just a reminder. It feels like a piece of herself that she thought she had lost has been given back to her and she finally feels like she can let herself heal and think about what comes next. Grateful that whatever that is, that Rio is going to be right there with her.</p><p>This next step with Rio does not scare her, not one bit. Rio seems to read her thoughts, presses their lips to her head and murmurs sleepily against her.</p><p>“Whatever comes next, I’m so glad it’s you that will be by my side.”</p><p>Agatha smiles, pressing her cheek more firmly against the gentle beat of Rio’s heart. “Me too.”</p>

<p> </p><p>The decision to get away for a week together might have been the best thing they have ever done. Getting to just be wrapped up in one another without anything else getting in the way has been incredible. They have had time spent away, long weekends here and there but nothing like this. </p><p>Also getting to see Agatha in next to no clothes for a week, well that’s Rio’s idea of heaven. The thin strapped bikinis have had them short circuiting and dropping to their knees more times than they can even keep count of. Getting scolded for the marks scattered across her skin has been more than worth it and Rio never plans to stop reminding Agatha how much they love her and every inch of her skin. Not that she has actually stopped Rio from devouring her at any point either. </p><p>The sun has left Rio’s skin glowing and getting to be somewhere where no one knows you and just getting to be content in knowing that even if people stare it’s meaningless, you will probably never see them again so their judgement means nothing. </p><p>So yeah, Rio has been loving getting to sit topless, their chest taped up, swim shorts clinging to their thighs without a care in the world. </p><p>They had been doing a lot of thinking recently, about themselves, about their relationship with Agatha and about what comes next for all of that. It has taken a couple of years but they have brought up recently that they do want to start taking testosterone, which of course Agatha was immediately supportive of. Research being done as they were pressed together on the sofa, hours spent discussing everything that it means. Rio really couldn’t have asked for a better support system. </p><p>However they are about to ask something that would put all of that on hold and they had spent weeks building up the courage, anxiety bubbling away in their stomach. It would be a big step and one they are sure Agatha is ready for just as much as them.</p><p>So as Agatha lies with her head on Rio’s chest, they know that there is no time like the present to talk to her. To tell her what’s been floating around their mind for weeks now. </p><p>“My love, are you still awake?” Rio whispers softly against her hair. </p><p>Agatha groans. “Mmm I am now, you okay?” </p><p>“Been thinking” Rio responds, this time there is no flinching whilst they wait for her to reply ‘never a good sign’ because Agatha loves when Rio thinks and they know that now, it’s an old habit that’s died and been perfectly replaced with encouragement and love. </p><p>“Talk to me, but I am not moving. I'm comfy,” Agatha responds, sounding much more awake now. </p><p>It’s a conversation that has floated between them before, Agatha still very much wanting and Rio very much willing to learn and consider. </p><p>“Okay got it,” Rio laughs. “It’s been something I’ve thought about for a while, researching and thinking and talking to Alice. I’m just going to say it otherwise I’ll get anxious and we’ll never get round to it.” Rio takes a deep breath before continuing. “Before I met you, I was sure I never wanted children. Didn’t want them to grow up in a household where their parents didn’t love each other, watching them trapped in a loveless marriage and thinking that was something they had to accept for themselves. Or they had to watch me not be myself or able to express who I wanted to be deep down. I didn’t want that for myself let alone anyone else. But you really changed that for me, Agatha.” </p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond, but the corner of a smile pressing against Rio’s chest tells them to keep talking. </p><p>“These past few years have been the best of my life and I, if you want to, think this is the type of love a child deserves to witness. I want to raise a child who has two parents who love them just as much as they love each other, maybe even more. I shouldn’t be the only one to experience your love. I want &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; home to be filled with more laughter and toys scattered across the living floor, height markers on the wall and their drawings stuck to our fridge. You’ve made me want all that, you are the one I want to do this with.” </p><p>They stop to pull in another breath, moving their hand to draw lazy circles against Agatha’s scalp. “I want our child to call for their mom when they fall and graze their knee and be lucky enough to have both of us come running. I want to have your child, our child. If it’s still something you’d want, I want to carry our baby.” </p><p>Agatha jolts up, sitting on the edge of the sunbed beside Rio’s legs. </p><p>“But what about your plans? Did you still wanna start taking T?” Agatha asks, the sleep still evident with her voice. </p><p>Of course the first thing she thinks about is how this would affect Rio and their own journey. </p><p>Rio laughs softly. “Of course, none of that has changed. The doctor said I could begin taking it between four to six weeks after the pregnancy. I still very much want to do that but I’ve waited long enough and the opportunity to do something for you, &lt;i&gt;for us&lt;/i&gt; surpasses that.” </p><p>And the tears fall, not quickly but they’re there. They can almost see the relief washing over Agatha’s face as she lets Rio’s words sink it. </p><p>“You would? You’d be okay with that?” Agatha sighs. </p><p>Rio nods quickly. “More than okay, I’ve been thinking about it for a while and figured there is no better time than now.” </p><p>The rest of the time on the sun lounger is spent with Rio reading off all the notes they had taken about the pregnancy, their pros and cons list to which there was only one con: their snoopy pjs wouldn’t fit anymore. </p><p>And then Agatha makes the call, Rio wonders if it is because Agatha doesn’t want them to go back on their word but from the way she is practically vibrating against them, they know it is because she couldn’t be anymore excited for this next step, together. </p><p>—</p><p>Months are passing quickly, quicker than either of them care to admit. Just over seven months ago they’d made the decision to have a baby together and now here Rio is, waddling along to the jeweler just short of five months pregnant. They had gotten extremely lucky falling pregnant through their first cycle and now those pjs definitely don’t fit them anymore. </p><p>They are incredibly content, more so than they had expected. Despite having never been more sure of a decision in their life, they still held their own worries. Would they still love the person they had become when things started changing? Would they still feel comfortable in themselves? And they did, and even when those small worries or doubts crept in, Agatha was right there beside them. </p><p>Carrying their son is a gift, a gift that Rio can’t believe they get to be a part of giving. </p><p>Rio pushes the door to the jeweler open, greeted by the same woman from all that time ago. They’d booked an appointment to make changes to Agatha’s ring before the holiday and then had pushed it back further once they decided to go ahead with having a baby together. The drawings are already completed and all that is left is for Rio to choose the stones. </p><p>They hand over the box with Agatha’s ring as the lady simultaneously places the tray of stones in front of them. The sudden feeling from when they stood in this exact position before floods through them, their love for Agatha has only grown stronger since then but it all feels just a little surreal to have made it this far.</p><p>Surreal to know that this is what they truly deserve. </p><p>They eventually pick out the most beautiful green and purple stone to surround the smaller blue and lighter green stones throughout the centre. A stone for each member of their family, ones that were a reminder of the constant love and care flowing throughout each of them. A reminder of each one of them, never forgotten and always present. </p><p>As Rio leaves the shop, the bag feels light in their hand. Sure the box weighs it down a little but the weight of their decision is freeing. They let their mind wander as they walk home, thinking about all the things they made it through to get to this moment. </p><p>The saying ‘to be loved is to be seen’ has never felt truer for them. Agatha Harkness gave them the space to grow, learn and fall in love with themselves over and over again. It was something they’d had to learn to get used to when their whole life had been spent being told they couldn’t be who they wanted to be and that they were wrong to want things for themselves. </p><p>Agatha Harkness’ love is a support beam, something that holds you up in the times you need it most even if you don’t know it. It’s always around, circling Rio like branches of a tree and holding them tight, protecting them from the world whilst showing them off to it quietly. It holds Rio up consistently with reminders that they are worthy and more than enough. </p><p>Whoever Rio ends up becoming they are confidently sure that version will be loved by Agatha just as much as the version before. It’s not the type of love that screams in the faces of yours and others, it’s the kind that fills your lungs with air and makes your heart beat profoundly against your chest. It’s the kind that you feel without needing to see or hear it. </p><p>For someone who’s only ever heard “I would love you more if you didn’t want to change”, or being treated like an accessory, being loved by Agatha Harkness is nothing like that and never will be. </p><p>Being loved by Agatha is safe, free and accepting. It feels like all the pain in Rio’s life led to Agatha, truly their light at the end of the tunnel. </p><p>Being loved by Agatha is something the whole world should get to experience but for once, Rio is happy to have something completely to themselves.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha blows a strand of hair that has come loose from her ponytail, she can feel the sweat cooling on the back of her neck. She realised three days ago that hard labour was not for her (she had painted half a wall at that point) and she now has a lot more appreciation for Rio being the hard worker of the two of them. Even at almost seven months pregnant Rio makes everything look effortless. The feature wall they had painted in less than a week is taunting Agatha as she works on the final wall of the room, she got the easy job, allegedly. Tell that to the pain in her back and constant crack of her knees with every movement. </p><p>The feature wall is ridiculously cute, long grass and trees with tiny bunnies scattered throughout, she told Rio to take full control of whatever vision they had and they delivered it perfectly. Agatha knew Rio had many talents but this one blew her away. </p><p>The room is slowly coming together, flat pack boxes are haphazardly stacked, fresh washed baby vests neatly folded and tucked in a drawer, a vast amount of diapers scattered on the floor because apparently ‘you can never have too much’. Agatha thinks they might have taken that too literally. </p><p>Just as Agatha lets out a frustrated sigh at the roller in her hands, like it’s the problem and not her, she hears a light chuckle from behind her. Rio leans against the door frame, the soft skin of their bump peeking out from the tank they have on, nothing quite fitting anymore. </p><p>There has been a glow to their cheeks for months now, one that makes them somehow even more handsome than they already were. There have been so little complaints throughout all of this too, they have taken each stage of carrying their child like it is the greatest thing they have ever gotten to be part of. Agatha understands, getting to watch Rio push past all the little parts of themselves that may have hated the changes it would do to their body, putting on hold things they wanted for themselves just to be able to give them both something they want so desperately. It has been the most beautiful thing Agatha has ever gotten to witness and be a part of. </p><p>“You’re looking at that roller like it killed your family,” Rio says, smirking when Agatha glares over her shoulder. </p><p>“It might have well have, it’s fucking useless,” Agatha replies through gritted teeth. </p><p>Rio hums, pressing further into the room. “I think you have more paint on yourself than on the walls.” They bite back the grin at the death stare it gets from Agatha and instead press themselves as close as they can to her back. “You’ve done an amazing job my love, your lines? Cleaner than I would have managed.” </p><p>Agatha knows they are full of shit but feels herself smiling anyway, dropping the roller at her feet and spinning to press her paint cover hands against Rio’s cheeks. </p><p>“You look beautiful like this,” Rio mumbles, Agatha’s hands pressing harder as she rolls her eyes. “I’m serious, I have heard you swear more in the last three days than in the last three and a half years,” They laugh lightly. “But you look ready, lighter, happy.” </p><p>“Ready?” Agatha asks, brow furrowing. </p><p>“For all of it,” Rio smiles. “The long nights, the tears, the chaos, the good days, the firsts, for anything that comes with this next step for us.” </p><p>Agatha had thought she would feel anxious, thought the old habits would creep in and have her worrying. However it hasn’t, all she has felt since that positive test is excitement. </p><p>She thinks about the little girl she lost often now, and doesn’t let the pain stop her from grieving the life she could have had. Some days are harder than others, wishing they had her there with them, getting to watch her grow and become a big sister. Agatha knows she is there in some way, can feel her with every twist of the ring on her finger and knows that regardless that she is still a part of their little family.</p><p>There were moments where she thought she would feel jealous, maybe even resentful that Rio was the one that got to carry, that her body couldn’t give her the one thing she had wanted. But she didn’t feel any of it, she took one look at Rio as they beamed at her, the test held proudly in front of them and all she could think was that she was the luckiest person on the planet. </p><p>That hadn’t changed since that moment, even now as she looks at Rio standing there, cheeks glowing pink, the stretch of their stomach and those soft brown eyes staring right back at her. All she can think about is how grateful she is for them, for the life they have together, for what comes next. </p><p>Agatha leans in, lips pressing softly against Rio’s, always ready for hers. “I am ready because I get to do it with you.”</p><p>When she pulls back and Rio looks at her again, their eyes are somehow even softer than before, all she feels is love and what is there to be afraid of when you have a love that looks like that? </p><p>Nothing, because the thing about love is that it usually comes with conditions. The kind of conditions that make you question if love is even for you. When you’ve only ever known “I love you but…” and there’s always been something you need to change in order to be seen as worthy of it. It makes you want to keep your heart locked up and safe from being cracked open and destroyed because the conditions will ruin you no matter how hard you try to think they won’t. </p><p>However, being loved by Rio Vidal is the kind of love that makes you rethink every single step you’ve ever taken in life. It shreds up every thought you’ve had on what love should look like and pieces them back together so tightly that if a crack even dared to attempt to form it will be filled back in before you can even blink.</p><p>Being loved by them is the kind of love that fills every single room with a warmth that settles so deeply that you could never imagine what it’s like to feel cold ever again. </p><p>There are no conditions, no ‘but’s’ at the end of sentences, no doubt of what their love looks like, no need to hide your own heart when theirs is worn so visibly on their sleeve. You can’t remember what it’s like to know a love that’s ever been different. </p><p>Agatha could never have imagined this is the kind of life she would have gotten not at eighteen and not even now at forty-three years old. Yet being loved by Rio has taught her to expect the unexpected, to jump into unknowns regardless of how scary it feels because it will always be worth it in the end. </p><p>—</p><p>Nicholas Vidal makes his grand entrance into the world on May 20th 2029 at 11:35pm, kicking and screaming like he already has so much to say just like his mom. </p><p>Their anniversary dinner had long since been abandoned because what better day for their son to come into the world than when they were celebrating the day that everything had changed for them both four years ago. A day that will be celebrated for many years to come not only for their love but now for the life they have created together. </p><p>As Rio lifts their eyes from the small bundle in their arms, they expect to see their wife looking at their son but instead they find her staring at them, tears staining her cheeks.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha whispers.</p><p>“No thank you my love,” Rio says gently, their hand coming up to wipe the fresh tears from her cheeks. “You have given me so much, given me so many reasons to be grateful and I could never find a way to thank you for the life we have. But if this is something I get to give you, to give us, I would do it a thousand times.”</p><p>“I think that’s a bit much,” Agatha chuckles, kissing the palm of Rio’s hand. “This is everything I could ever need right here in front of me.”</p><p>“I would give you the world if I could,” Rio whispers.</p><p>Agatha leans into their touch, her own hand coming to cover theirs. “You already have.”</p>
